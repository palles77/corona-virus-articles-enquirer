Currently, there is no effective anti-2019-nCoV medication. The sequence identity of the 3CL proteases of 2019-nCoV and SARS is 96%, which provides a sound foundation for structural-based drug repositioning (SBDR). Based on a SARS 3CL protease X-ray crystal structure, we construct a 3D homology structure of 2019-nCoV 3CL protease. Based on this structure and existing experimental datasets for SARS 3CL protease inhibitors, we develop an SBDR model based on machine learning and mathematics to screen 1465 drugs in the DrugBank that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We found that many FDA approved drugs are potentially highly potent to 2019-nCoV.",

By Feb 5, 2020, more than 24000 individuals were infected and more than 490 fatalities had been reported. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared this novel coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency. Currently, there is no specific antiviral drug for this epidemic. Considering the severity of this widespread dissemination and health threats, panic patients misled by media flocked to the pharmacies for Chinese Medicine herbs which were reported to \"inhibit\" the 2019-nCoV, despite no clinical evidence supporting the claim. Many researchers are engaged in developing anti-2019-nCoV drug s [1, 2] . However, new drug discovery and development is a long, costly and rigorous scientific process. A more effective approach is to search for anti-2019-nCoV therapies from the existing FDA-approved drug database.",

Several successful examples unveil its great values in practice: Nelfinavir, initially developed to treat the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is now being used for cancer treatments. Amantadine was firstly designed to treat influenza caused by type A influenza viral infection and is being used for Parkinson's disease later on [6] . In recent years, the rapid growth of drug-related datasets, as well as open data initiatives, has led to new developments for computational drug repositioning, particularly, structural-based drug repositioning (SBDR). Machine learning, network analysis, and text mining and semantic inference are three major computational approaches commonly applied in drug repositioning [7] . The rapid accumulation of genetic and structural databases [8] , the development of low-dimensional mathematical representations of complex biomolecular structures [9, 10] , and the availability of advanced deep learning algorithms have made machine learning-based drug reposition a promising approach [7] . Considering the urgent need for anti-2019-nCoV drugs, a computational drug repositioning is one of the most feasible strategies for discovering 2019-nCoV drugs.",

The sequence identities of 2019-nCoV 3CL protease, RNA polymerase, and the spike protein with corresponding SARS-CoV proteins are 96.08%, 96%, and 76%, respectively [12] . We, therefore, hypothesize that a potent SARS 3CL protease inhibitor is also a potent 2019-nCoV 3CL protease inhibitor. Unfortunately, there is no effective SARS therapy at present. Nevertheless, the X-ray crystal structure of SARS 3CL protease has been reported [13] and the binding affinities of 115 potential SARS 3CL protease inhibitors are available in ChEMBL database [14] . Additionally, there are 15,843 protein-ligand complexes in PDBbind 2018 general set with binding affinities and X-ray crystal structures [15] . Moreover, the DrugBank contains about 1600 drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [16] .

The sequence identities between 2019-nCoV protease and the protease of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HKU-1, OC43, HCoVNL63, 229E, and HIV are 96.1%, 52.0%, 49.0%, 48.4%, 45.2%, 41.9%, and 23.7%, respectively. It is seen that 2019-nCoV protease is very close to SARS-CoV protease, but is distinguished from other proteases. Clearly, 2019-nCoV has a strong genetic relationship with SARS-CoV, the sequence alignment in Figure 1 further confirms their relationship. Additionally, the available experimental data of SARS-CoV protease inhibitors can be used as the training set to generate new inhibitors of 2019-nCoV protease. Since the sequences are highly identical, the 2019-nCoV protease structure can be built by homology modeling with the SARS-CoV 3CL protease (PDB ID: 2A5I) [13] as a template. It turns out, as shown in Fig. 2 , the homology structure of the 2019-nCoV protease is essentially identical to the X-ray structure of SARS-CoV 3CL protease. Particularly, the RMSD of two structures at the binding site is 0.21\u00c5. The high structural similarity between the two proteases suggests that anti-SARS-CoV chemicals can be equally effective for the treatment of 2019-nCoV.",

A total of 1553 FDA-approved drugs are contained in the DrugBank. However, in the present work, a number of FDA-approved drugs encountered difficulties in docking with the target molecule. Therefore, the MathPose successfully created 3D protein-ligand complex structures for 1465 FDA-approved drugs and 2019-nCoV protease. MathDL, designed for predicting various druggable properties of 3D molecules [23] , is capable of efficiently and accurately encoding the high-dimensional biomolecular interactions into low-dimensional representations. Algebraic graph theory-based algorithms [25] , differential geometry, and algebraic topology methods [23] are applied to generate three mathematical representations of data in MathDL. These data representations can be integrated with well-designed deep learning models, such as gradient-boosted trees (GBTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for pose ranking and binding affinity predictions. In D3R Grand Challenges (https://drugdesigndata.org/about/grand-challenge), a worldwide competition series in computer-aided drug design, MathDL had been proved as the top performer in free energy prediction and ranking [22, 23] . Figure 4 illustrates the framework of the MathDL model, which combined the aforementioned mathematical representations with the CNN architecture for druggable properties predictions. The PDBbind 2018 general set [15] , along with the SARS 3CL protease related dataset is used in our training process. In this section, we briefly describe the algebraic topology representation used in the present work. Details can be found in the literature [23] .",

Although there is no effective anti-viral medicine for the 2019-nCoV, the 3CL proteases of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV have a sequence identity of 96%, which provides a foundation for us to hypothesize that all potential anti-SARS-CoV chemotherapies are also effective anti-2019-CoV molecules. We build a three-dimensional (3D) 2019-nCoV 3CL protease structure using a SARS-CoV 3CL protease crystal structure as a template and collect a set of 84 SARS-CoV inhibition experimental data. The molecules of this set are docked to the 3D 2019-nCoV 3CL protease structure to form a machine learning training set. Additionally, the PDBbind 2018 general set of 15,843 protein-ligand complexes is also included as an additional machine learning training set. Using these training sets, we develop two deep learning models based on low-dimensional algebraic topology representations of macromolecular complexes. A total of 1465 FDA-approved drugs is evaluated by their binding affinities predicted by the consensus of two models built with 1) a combination of algebraic topology and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and 2) a combination of algebraic topology and deep multitask CNNs. According to the predicted binding affinities, we recommend many FDA-approved drugs as potentially highly potent medications to 2019-nCoV, which serve as a crucial step for the development of anti-2019-nCoV drugs.",
