            "text": "Background: Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are common during the Hajj season and are caused by a variety of organisms, which can be transmitted via the air or contaminated surfaces. We conducted a study aimed at sampling the environment in the King Abdul Aziz International (KAAI) Airport, Pilgrims City, Jeddah, during Hajj season to detect respiratory pathogens. Methods: Active air sampling was conducted using air biosamplers, and swabs were used to sample frequently touched surfaces. A respiratory multiplex array was used to detect bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens. Results: Of the 58 environmental samples, 8 were positive for at least 1 pathogen. One air sample (1 of 18 samples, 5.5%) tested positive for influenza B virus. Of the 40 surface samples, 7 (17.5%) were positive for pathogens. These were human adenovirus (3 out of 7, 42.8%), human coronavirus OC43/HKU1 (3 out of 7, 42.8%), Haemophilus influenzae (1 out of 7, 14.2%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (1 out of 7, 14.2%). Chair handles were the most commonly contaminated surfaces. The handles of 1 chair were cocontaminated with coronavirus OC43/HKU1 and H influenzae. Conclusion: Respiratory pathogens were detected in the air and on surfaces in the KAAI Airport in Pilgrims City. Larger-scale studies based on our study are warranted to determine the role of the environment in transmission of respiratory pathogens during mass gathering events (eg, Hajj) such that public health preventative measures might be better targeted.",

            "text": "Mass gatherings, such as sporting or musical events, political rallies, or those of spiritual nature (eg, Hajj), bring large numbers of people to a specific site for a defined period of time. Such gatherings increase the likelihood of the spread of infectious diseases. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia annually hosts >2 million Muslim pilgrims from around 184 countries during the Hajj pilgrimage, making it one of the largest and most culturally and geographically diverse mass gatherings in the world. 1 Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are the most common infection transmitted between pilgrims during Hajj, and most pilgrims develop RTIs during their few weeks stay in Makkah and Madinah. 2 In one study, 60.8% of pilgrims attending primary care centers during the Hajj had a respiratory disease. 3 Among a cohort of 154 French pilgrims participating in the 2012 Hajj, 83.4% had respiratory symptoms, including 41.0% with influenza-like illness. Pneumonia is also a leading cause of hospitalization of pilgrims in Saudi hospitals during Hajj, including intensive care units. 4, 5 In 1986, pneumonia was the second most common cause of hospitalization with an incidence of 4.8 per 100,000 and a case fatality rate of 34%. 6 Viruses are a common cause of RTIs during Hajj. In one study, nasopharyngeal and throat swabs were taken from 3,218 pilgrims during the 2009 Hajj season and tested for 18 respiratory viruses. The main viruses detected among pilgrims were rhinovirusenterovirus (12.9%), coronaviruses (0.8%), respiratory syncytial virus (0.2%), and influenza A virus (0.2%), including pandemic influenza A (H1N1) (0.1%). 7 The threat of new respiratory viruses is always present during Hajj. The novel H7N9 avian influenza A virus first reported in 2013 to have infected humans in China and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus first reported in 2012 from Saudi Arabia are cases in point. 8, 9 The etiology of RTIs in Hajj is not limited to viruses. A number of other organisms (eg, bacteria, fungi) are responsible for such infections during Hajj. Tuberculosis is an important public health problem because large numbers of pilgrims come from high tuberculosis-endemic areas of the world and may have latent or active tuberculosis. 10 One study examined 64 cases of pneumonia admitted to 2 hospitals in Makkah during the 1994 Hajj season. Diagnosis was established in 46 patients (72%), with Mycobacterium tuberculosis being the most prevalent organism (20%), followed by gram-negative bacilli (18.8%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (10%), Legionella pneumophila (6%), and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (6%). 11 In another study of 141 pilgrims with clinical suspicion of pneumonia, 76 (53.9%) were confirmed positive by microbiological tests. The most frequent isolates were Candida albicans (28.7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.8%), L. pneumophila (14.9%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.2%). 12 Respiratory pathogens can be transmitted via the air or through contact with contaminated environmental surfaces. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Surveillance of these respiratory pathogens in the environment during Hajj can be indicative of the type of pathogens and strains circulating during the pilgrimage with the possibility of potentially causing epidemics. This surveillance could serve as an early warning system and guide for early interventions to prevent or reduce transmission of novel infectious agents.",

It is the fourth largest airport terminal in the world after Hong Kong, Bangkok, and Seoul. It can receive about 50,000 pilgrims a day in the Hajj season.

Biosamplers (SKC Inc, Eighty Four, PA) were used to sample the air at various locations and times in the Hajj terminal as described in Table 1 . The biosamplers were positioned at 1.5 m from the floor and run at a sampling flow rate of 6 L/min for 2 hours, hence the sampling of 720 L of air in each run. Whereas biosamplers are typically used at a sampling flow rate of 12.5 L/min for bacteria and fungi, the same procedure does not work well for viruses. Instead, lower sampling rates (6-8 L/min) have resulted in increased collection efficiencies for airborne viruses in field and laboratory tests (J. Lednicky, 2010, and C. Y. Wu, 2009 and 2010, unpublished data). Microorganisms were collected in 20 mL of collection media composed of 0.5 weight/ volume sterile Bovine Serum Albumin Fraction V (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) in a Phosphate Buffered Saline solution (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). The media were then aseptically transferred into sterile polypropylene 50 mL clinical-grade centrifuge tubes and frozen at \u00c080 C until further processing.",

Goyal et al 21 investigated contamination of the air by respiratory viruses in 2 large public buildings in the United States by analyzing the content of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning filters of the air-handling units in the buildings. Nine of the 64 filters tested were positive for influenza A virus, 2 filters were positive for influenza B virus, and 1 filter was positive for parainfluenza virus 1. Soto et al 20 performed air sampling to detect bacteria and fungi at representative areas within a Spanish university. Most bacteria identified were gram-positive cocci belonging to the Micrococcus, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus species. Other bacteria (eg, Neisseria, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter) were also identified. Cladosporium was the predominant genus isolated among fungi, in addition to other genera identified at lower rates (eg, Aspergillus, Candida, Penicillium). The study also reported that in the indoor air, bacterial contamination exceeds fungal contamination and the former originates from humans occupying the indoor space, whereas fungi probably come from exogenous sources.",

            "text": "Our study has some limitations. We sampled a relatively small number of locations at a particular time during the Hajj. We also sampled the air for a specific time period. Sampling at more locations at various times (crowded and quiet times) for longer periods of time using procedures optimized for viruses in parallel with those for bacteria and fungi would improve the likelihood of detection of pathogens and would inform which periods and locations during the Hajj pathogens are most likely to be present in the air or on surfaces. For instance, studies have shown that human activity and densely populated areas have an effect on the density and variety of microorganisms in the environment. 20, 23 Our study aimed to detect a set of 22 viral and bacterial pathogens. This meant that other respiratory pathogens, including fungi and other viruses and bacteria not included in the panel, would have been missed. Additionally, because the detection was based on molecular techniques alone, it is unclear whether the detected pathogens were infectious or alive at the time of sampling because direct culturing was not perfumed. On the other hand, there is evidence to support that only a small percentage of microorganisms surviving in natural environments can be cultured and quantified using conventional and standard microbiological media. 33 Considering the 22 pathogens screened for in the multiplex assay, individual culture for these same reagents would have been complex and very expensive. Hence, although the use of molecular techniques, similar to the ones we used, may overestimate the presence of viable agents, it is more practical, less expensive, and less complex than a complex, multiple pathogen, direct culture approach. Further investigations, including both molecular and culture techniques, for the detection of a wider range of respiratory and enteric pathogens seem warranted.",

Sampling approaches used in this study may prove useful in designing interventions to reduce RTIs transmission during Hajj. Future interventions may include public health policies encouraging the wearing of protective face masks at certain locations and times during Hajj, emphasis on hand hygiene, and improved cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched surfaces at various locations during the pilgrimage.",
