Surface location of fusion protein was verified by ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence test. Oral and intranasal inoculations of pregnant sow and mice with recombinant L. casei resulted in high levels of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) against recombinant N protein as demonstrated by ELISA. More importantly, the level of specific sIgA in colostrum significantly increased compared with that of IgG. The serum IgG levels of the piglets increased after suckling colostrum produced by sows was previously inoculated with recombinant L. casei. These results indicate that immunization with recombinant L. casei expressing TGEV N protein on its surface elicited high levels of specific sIgA and circulating IgG against TGEV N protein.",

A variety of viruses, bacteria, and protozoans have been used successfully as vaccine delivery systems in several experimental models. The delivery of vaccine subunits to the mucosal surface by a suitable live microbial vector is a rational approach to get around the obstacles encountered by parenteral vaccines. Oral antigen delivery systems that potentiate mucosal immune responses against adherent pathogens have received considerable attention because parenteral immunization usually elicits little or no mucosal immunity. However, potential safety and environmen-tal considerations, particularly the immune status of the vaccine recipients in developing countries, still raise much concern over the use of the mucosally delivered vector candidates such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and vaccinia virus. Therefore, nonpathogenic, food grade, or commensal bacterial vectors have begun to receive attention for their vaccine potential (Lee et al. 2006) .",

            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a coronavirus that causes acute diarrhea in piglets, characterized by up to 100% mortality among neonatal pigs (Sestak et al. 1996 (Sestak et al. , 2002 . Maternal antibodies, passed to piglets in colostrums and milk, provide effective protection against infection. Against the TGEV infection, a variety of viral vaccines (virulent, attenuated, inactivated, and subunit) and routes of administration (oral, intranasal, intramuscular, subcutaneous, and intramammary) have been tested for induction of neonatal immunity (Kaji and Shimizu 1978; Moxley and Olson 1989; Saif et al. 1994) . However, only oral administration of live virulent virus to pregnant sows generally gave the highest level of immunity, resulting in protective immunity for the sow and consistently producing high level of persisting IgA TGEV antibodies in milk associated with protective neonatal immunity for sucking piglets. During this decade, emphasis had been laid on the development of new vaccines for active and passive immunity to TGEV. Since stimulation of intestinal immunity is important to induce protection against TGEV, investigators have attempted to develop genetically engineered vaccines using live recombinant vectors such as attenuated strains of Salmonella typhimurium (Smerdou et al. 1996) . However, no pig protection studies have been reported. Studies are in progress using a live eukaryotic vector, human adenovirus 5, to express TGEV S glycoprotein that induced neutralizing antibodies in the serum of swine inoculated orally, nasally, and intraperitoneally (Torres et al. 1996) . No results were reported on the direct TGEV challenge to the recombinant TGEV adenovirus-inoculated pigs. In recent years, major technique advances in a great deal to generate antibodies including hybridoma, bacteria, and phage systems made it possible that a new recombinant vaccine might be a promising candidate vaccine for the control of swine disease (Maynard and Gerorgiou 2000; Humphreys and Glover 2001) .",
