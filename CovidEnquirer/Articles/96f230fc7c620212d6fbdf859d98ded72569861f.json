Concern about its associated morbidity and cost has led to a large body of research that has been summarised in systematic reviews and integrated into clinical practice guidelines in several countries. The evidence and guideline recommendations consistently support a clinical diagnosis with the limited role for diagnostic testing for children presenting with the typical clinical syndrome of viral upper respiratory infection progressing to the lower respiratory tract. Management is largely supportive, focusing on maintaining oxygenation and hydration of the patient. Evidence suggests no benefi t from bronchodilator or corticosteroid use in infants with a fi rst episode of bronchiolitis. Evidence for other treatments such as hypertonic saline is evolving but not clearly defi ned yet. For infants with severe disease, the insuffi cient available data suggest a role for high-fl ow nasal cannula and continuous positive airway pressure use in a monitored setting to prevent respiratory failure.",

            "text": "Acute bronchiolitis, a viral infection of the lower respiratory tract, is one of the most substantial health burdens for infants and young children worldwide. 1 Respiratory syncytial virus is the most prevalent viral cause of bronchiolitis in infants. Estimates suggest that about 34 million new cases of lower respiratory infection due to respiratory syncytial virus occur globally in children younger than 5 years, with 3\u00b74 million admissions to hospitals and about 199 000 deaths per year, predominantly in the developing world. 2 In developed countries such as the USA, bronchiolitis is the most common reason for admission to hospital in the fi rst 12 months of life, 3 accounting for approximately 100 000 infant admissions annually. Although admissions to hospital have declined from 2000 to 2010, emergency department visits have increased, in addition to increased use of mechanical ventilation and hospital charges. 4, 5 The clinical management remains challenging despite the frequency, global reach, economic cost, and morbidity and mortality associated with bronchiolitis. Several treatment strategies (including bronchodilators and corticosteroids) showed no eff ect in pooled metaanalyses, making supportive care the hallmark of current therapy. In this Seminar, we aim to summarise the current evidence for the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnostic approach, and management of acute viral bronchiolitis.",

            "text": "Bronchiolitis is a seasonal infection, with the season typically beginning in late October in the temperate northern hemisphere, peaking in January or February, and ending in April. 6 Globally, independent of region, respiratory syncytial virus infection peaks consistently during annual or biannual epidemics. Although the peak and duration of these epidemics vary worldwide, they are consistent year-to-year within a country. 7 Some data suggest that climate might also be associated with prevalence of respiratory syncytial virus infection, with global surveillance suggesting that infection peaks during wet months in areas with high precipitation and during cooler months in hot regions. 7 Indoor crowding in population-dense areas during rainy seasons or cooler months might be one factor that facilitates viral transmission. 8 Additionally, weather-related factors, such as inhalation of cold and dry air that might impair ciliary function, the airway mucosa, and inhibition of temperature-dependent antiviral responses, might infl uence both disease transmission and severity. 9, 10 Altitude, climate, and meteorological conditions (such as wind speed and dew point) have been shown to have a modest association with bronchiolitis. 11, 12 Furthermore, air pollutants, such as ozone and traffi c pollutants, have been associated with exacerbations of respiratory infections in children younger than 5 years. [13] [14] [15] Environmental tobacco smoke has been associated with increased risk for respiratory syncytial virus-attributable admission to hospital and disease severity in those admitted. 16, 17 As with other respiratory viral infections, the risk of severe respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis might be greater in boys than in girls. 18, 19 This diff erence might be due to diff erences in lung and airway development, and by genetic factors. 8, 20 Pathophysiology Bronchiolitis is characterised by extensive infl ammation and oedema of the airways, increased mucus production, and necrosis of airway epithelial cells. 21 Respiratory syncytial virus binds to epithelial cells and replicates, resulting in epithelial necrosis and ciliary destruction. 21, 22 The cell destruction triggers an infl ammatory response with proliferation of polymorphonuclear cells and lymphocytes. The submucosa and adventitial tissues become oedematous with increased mucus secretion. 22 Plugs composed of cellular debris and mucus form in the bronchiole lumens leading to bronchiolar obstruction, air trapping, and diff erent degrees of lobar collapse. 21 Microbiology Molecular testing has led to an improved understanding of the viruses associated with bronchiolitis. Respiratory syncytial virus remains the most commonly identifi ed virus, detected in 41-83% of patients. [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] Other viruses associated with bronchiolitis include rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, coronavirus, human bocavirus, infl uenza virus, adenovirus, and parainfl uenza virus. 24, 25, 27, 29, 30 Studies have investigated whether severity of illness, as measured by need for hospital admission, length of hospital stay, intensive care unit admission, repeated emergency department visits, and apnoea, is associated with specifi c viral infections or co-infections, but the evidence is confl icting. Data from some studies have shown that in infections involving a single virus, respiratory syncytial virus is associated with a more severe course compared with other viruses. 31, 32 Up to 30% of children with bronchiolitis are found to have co-infections with two other viruses, 29 with the combination of respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus being the most commonly reported. 29 Some evidence suggests that co-infection in bronchiolitis, particularly respiratory syncytial virus in combination with rhinovirus or metapneumovirus, could be associated with a more severe disease course compared with infection by a single virus. 25, 30, 31, 33, 34 However, other studies do not confi rm this association. 24, 26 Furthermore, although use of nucleic acid amplifi cation tests has greatly improved our ability to detect viruses present in respiratory infections, studies using these technologies have also found at least one respiratory virus in up to 30% of children younger than 6 years with no respiratory symptoms. [35] [36] [37] These viruses might be detected because of asymptomatic colonisation, incubation before clinical infection, or prolonged viral shedding post-infection. The confl icting evidence and high prevalence of respiratory viruses in asymptomatic children suggest no indication at this time that management should vary based on presumed viral cause and presence, or absence of viral co-infections.",

            "text": "The classic clinical presentation of bronchiolitis starts with symptoms of a viral upper respiratory infection, such as nasal discharge, that progress to the lower respiratory tract over several days (fi gure 1). Timing of symptom progression can vary, and young infants can present with apnoea. Lower respiratory tract symptoms of bronchiolitis include persistent cough, tachypnoea, and increased work of breathing, as shown by intercostal or supraclavicular retractions, use of abdominal muscles, grunting, or nasal fl aring. Auscultatory fi ndings include crackles and wheeze. A hallmark characteristic of bronchiolitis is the minute-to-minute variation in clinical fi ndings, as mucus and debris in the airways are cleared by coughing or as the child's state changes from sleep to agitation. This variation can confound assessment, and often requires several examinations over a period of observation. Nasal congestion can also confound the clinical assessment. Nasal suctioning might help to ascertain which fi ndings are truly from the lower airways. Fever can be present in about a third of infants with bronchiolitis, but it is usually present early in the illness with a temperature less than 39\u00b0C. 38 The median duration of symptoms is about 2 weeks, with 10-20% of infants still having symptoms at 3 weeks after onset. 38, 41 Various clinical scores have been shown in studies and clinical protocols to correlate with disease severity and improvement. 42, 43 Although documentation of a score can be useful as an objective measure, individual scores are not highly predictive, and they should be repeated and combined with other measures of severity for a universal assessment to guide decision making. The diff erential diagnosis for bronchiolitis includes considerations of various infectious and non-infectious causes. Absence of upper respiratory symptoms should raise suspicion of other causes of respiratory distress in young infants, including cardiac disease, congenital airway abnormalities such as a vascular ring, or foreign body aspiration. Other infections can resemble or complicate bronchiolitis. Pertussis should be considered in infants with severe or paroxysmal cough, or with known exposure. Bacterial infections complicating viral bronchiolitis, including otitis media or pneumonia, might present as a new fever or worsening status later in the course of illness.",

Findings suggest that arbitrary thresholds for oxygen administration might drive hospital admissions and prolong hospital length of stay. These outcomes represent only part of the morbidity of bronchiolitis, but developing evidence suggests that intermittent hypoxaemia might occur commonly in otherwise stable infants with bronchiolitis and raises questions as to whether this factor should be used as a sole indication for admission to hospitals. A Canadian randomised trial found reduced admissions to hospital from the emergency department without any increase in revisits when pulse oximeters displayed values 3% higher than the actual value, suggesting that arbitrary pulse oximetry thresholds result in unnecessary admissions. 51 A similar trial in the UK in the hospital setting found that reduction of the oxygen threshold from 94% to 90% resulted in earlier discharge from the hospital without any evidence of adverse outcomes. 52 A US trial comparing intermittent versus continuous pulse oximetry in non-hypoxaemic infants in hospitals found similar outcomes between the groups. 53 This US trial and other evidence supports recommendations in US practice guidelines that clinicians use a threshold of 90% for initiation of oxygen, whereas UK guidelines recommend 92%. 38, 39 As the child improves, reduction in intensity of monitoring to intermittent checks is appropriate. A recent study using blinded oximetry at home showed that a substantial proportion of infants with bronchiolitis who are otherwise doing well have oxygen desaturations less than 90%, particularly during sleep, further calling into question arbitrary thresholds for hospital admissions and initiation of oxygen. 54 This evidence will probably lead to eff orts to reduce continuous monitoring in children without other indications for monitoring.",

One prospective study 58 of routine radiographs as part of the assessment for bronchiolitis in the emergency department reported airspace disease in 17 (7%) of 246 patients. Despite the low prevalence of radiographic pneumonia, this and other studies have reported an increase in antibiotic prescription after radiographs are performed, because of non-specifi c fi ndings that infl uence clinicians' decisions. 58, 59 Factors that have been associated with defi nite focal infi ltrates consistent with pneumonia include hypoxia (oxygen saturation <92%), [56] [57] [58] 60 grunting, persistently focal crackles, and fever (especially >39\u00b0C). 38 Chest radiographs should only be considered in patients when the presentation is not classic for bronchiolitis. These situations include when another diagnosis (such as foreign body aspiration) is high on the diff erential diagnosis, when a child is severely ill and respiratory failure is imminent, and when symptoms are progressing or not resolving according to the typical disease course expected for bronchiolitis. Lung ultrasound is increasingly used to assess cardiopulmonary conditions in adults and children. Several studies have investigated the use of lung ultrasound in the diagnosis of bronchiolitis. Two small studies found that ultrasound fi ndings in infants with bronchiolitis correlate with clinical fi ndings, and might be more specifi c than chest radiography, 61,62 but further studies are needed to establish whether there is a role for ultrasound in diagnosis or assessment of severity.",

Virological testing, however, does not generally assist in management and is insuffi cient to predict outcomes. 30, 63 Many national guidelines therefore recommend against routine virological testing in bronchiolitis (table). Recent studies suggest that higher respiratory syncytial virus genomic load, measured using quantitative PCR, might be associated with increased length of stay, use of respiratory support, and need for intensive care, in addition to recurrent wheezing, compared with lower viral loads. 28, 31, 32, 64 Further study is warranted to confi rm this association and clarify whether viral load measurement improves understanding of disease pathophysiology and severity. Several guidelines recommend using respiratory syncytial virus testing to guide cohorting of patients; however, the viruses most likely to cause bronchiolitis are all transmitted in a similar fashion (close contact with large-particle aerosols or direct contact with contaminated fomites). [65] [66] [67] Thus, infection control might not be dependent on the identifi cation of specifi c viruses, but rather on following strict precautions including hand hygiene, separating infants in shared hospital rooms by more than 1 m, and other infection control procedures. 65 Additionally, given the sensitivity of PCR testing, results should be interpreted with caution. Certain viruses, such as rhinovirus, might be detected because of viral shedding from an unrelated illness or colonisation; whereas certain other viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus and metapneumovirus, are almost always associated with an acute infection.",

Multiple new agents for prevention and treatment are under investigation and might become available in the future, including immunoglobulins, small interfering RNA interference, fusion inhibitors, and small molecules. 74 Numerous studies have assessed the role of bronchodilators for the treatment of bronchiolitis, and systematic reviews have found no consistent benefi t.

No substantial adverse eff ects of hypertonic saline were noted in this systematic review. Although the results of this meta-analysis were signifi cant, attention should be paid to the outer limits of the confi dence intervals, which approach no diff erence, and to the clinical relevance of these diff erences. A second 2015 meta-analysis of 15 trials and 1922 patients found a smaller, but signifi cant, decrease in length of stay by -0\u00b736 days (95% CI -0\u00b75 to -0\u00b722; p<0\u00b7001) in those who received hypertonic saline (fi gure 3). 92 This study found a discrepancy between the overall combined eff ect of all studies on length of stay and the negative results from the largest trials, allowing the authors to conclude that neither individual trials nor pooled estimates provide a strong evidence-based foundation for the use of hypertonic saline. Both meta-analyses showed substantial heterogeneity across studies (I\u00b2=82\u00b71%, p<0\u00b7001; 91 and I\u00b2=77\u00b78%, p=0\u00b7029 92 ). A recent reanalysis of the fi rst 2015 meta-analysis removed two outlying Chinese studies and accounted for imbalances in day of illness at presentation. 93 These analyses resolved the heterogeneity and found that hypertonic saline does not reduce length of stay in infants admitted to hospitals with bronchiolitis (mean diff erence in length of stay removing outliers -0\u00b721 days; 95% CI -0\u00b743 to 0\u00b702; mean diff erence in length of stay accounting for day of illness imbalance 0\u00b702 days; 95% CI -0\u00b714 to 0\u00b717). Large trials have not demonstrated benefi t for hypertonic saline and this meta-analysis found no eff ect of hypertonic saline on length of stay after adjustment for outliers and imbalances. The decision to undertake future trials is controversial given the positive results of some metaanalyses and negative results of others.",

Among the included eight outpatient studies (1824 participants) comparing corticosteroids with placebo there was no reduction in admission at day 1 (Z=1\u00b705; p=0\u00b73) or day 7 (Z=1\u00b738; p=0\u00b717) after enrolment (fi gure 4), clinical scores, length of stay in the emergency department, or length of time to resolution of symptoms. Among the nine inpatient studies (772 participants), length of hospital stay was not reduced. 96 On the basis of this evidence, multiple clinical practice guidelines recommend against the use of corticosteroids for infants with bronchiolitis (table) . Although clinicians report considering a family or personal history of atopy when deciding whether to treat infants with bronchiolitis with corticosteroids, 41 there is no evidence that such infants receive any benefi t from corticosteroid treatment.

Bronchiolitis, however, has a clear viral cause and the occurrence of secondary bacterial infections is low, with a risk of bacteraemia or meningitis of less than 1%. 99 A detailed review of randomised clinical trials found that routine use of antibiotics did not improve duration of symptoms, length of hospital stay, need for oxygen therapy, or hospital admission. 38 Overuse of antibiotics is known to result in unnecessary adverse eff ects on the patient, and the development of antimicrobial resistance. Routine use should be avoided unless there is clear evidence of a secondary bacterial infection (table) . Acute otitis media has been documented in up to 60% of infants with bronchiolitis. 100, 101 Antibiotic use for acute otitis media in bronchiolitis should follow established evidence and guidelines for acute otitis media. 102 Macrolide antibiotics have anti-infl ammatory properties that might have potential benefi t in mitigating the infl ammation present in bronchiolitis. Two randomised trials found that there was no diff erence between azithromycin and placebo in hospital length of stay, need for oxygen, or hospital re-admission. 103, 104 Another randomised trial found that azithromycin lowered nasal interleukin-8 concentrations, prolonged time to subsequent wheezing episodes, and resulted in fewer days with respiratory symptoms in the year following the bronchiolitis episode compared with placebo. 105 Finally, a US multicentre study found that in children aged 12-72 months with a history of recurrent severe lower respiratory tract infections, early administration of azithromycin during a lower respiratory tract infection reduced the likelihood of progression to a severe infection, but it is not clear whether the underlying disease in these children was bronchiolitis or some other disease process. 106 Given the current evidence, routine use of macrolides is not recommended in bronchiolitis and more research is needed to clarify any potential role it might have in the future.",

            "text": "Hydration, suctioning, and chest physiotherapy have been suggested as supportive therapies. Infants with bronchiolitis might have diffi culty feeding because of nasal congestion and increased work of breathing; thus, hydration remains a cornerstone of therapy. A multicentre study of 759 infants younger than 12 months admitted to hospital with bronchiolitis showed no benefi t of intravenous fl uids compared with administration of fl uids by nasogastric tube in mean length of stay, admission to the intensive care unit, need for ventilatory support, and adverse events. This trial also found that a nasogastric tube might be easier to place than an intravenous line in these infants. 107 Most guidelines recommend either nasogastric or intravenous fl uids to maintain hydration, with the UK and Scottish guidelines preferring nasogastric or orogastric hydration in those that can tolerate it compared with intravenous hydration (table). If intravenous fl uids are used, isotonic fl uids are preferred to avoid risk of hyponatraemia. 38 Because infants are obligate nasal breathers, nasal suctioning has been suggested to help with clearing of the nares, improve the work of breathing, and improve feeding; however, suctioning might irritate the nasal mucosa and result in oedema. No randomised controlled trials have examined the role of nasal suctioning in bronchiolitis. The insuffi cient available evidence includes a retrospective cohort study of 740 infants 108 and a small observational study of 40 infants. 109 These studies suggest that deep suctioning might increase length of stay for inpatients, 108 infrequent suctioning is associated with an increased length of stay, 108 and oxygen saturation might increase after suctioning. 109 To draw conclusions about causality from these observational studies is diffi cult, because the potential for confouding by indication exists (eg, sicker children might be more likely to receive deep suctioning). Evidence suggests that oxygen saturation increases after nasal irrigation even without suctioning. 110 Current guidelines give diff ering recommendations with regard to suctioning; those that support its use recommend only superfi cial suctioning rather than deep suctioning (table) . 38, 39, 45 Chest physiotherapy use in bronchiolitis appears to vary by country. 111, 112 A recent Cochrane Collaboration review of 12 studies (1249 participants) demonstrated no evidence of benefi t to any type of chest physiotherapy among inpatients in length of stay, oxygen saturation, or respiratory parameters. 113 No published guidelines routinely recommend chest physiotherapy for the management of uncomplicated bronchiolitis in otherwise healthy children without respiratory comorbidities (table) . 38, 39, 45 Prognosis Much work has been published about the risk of developing recurrent wheezing and asthma following bronchiolitis in infancy. [114] [115] [116] Studies have followed birth cohorts to determine the risk of subsequent wheezing after lower respiratory tract infection in young childhood, and cohorts of children admitted to hospital with bronchiolitis. [114] [115] [116] [117] Overall, admission to hospital with bronchiolitis at a young age is associated with an increased risk of recurrent wheezing. Studies report that 17-60% of children with bronchiolitis might develop recurrent wheezing in the years following their initial admission to hospital. A large study from Taiwan that followed up 1981 children admitted with bronchiolitis before age 3 years found that by age 10 years, 351 (17\u00b77%) of 1981 children with bronchiolitis had a diagnosis of asthma compared with 2159 (11\u00b77%) of 18 527 controls (hazard ratio 1\u00b758; 95% CI 1\u00b741-1\u00b771). 118 One small cohort study of 138 patients has suggested that 18 (39%) of 46 children admitted with bronchiolitis before 12 months have asthma by 18 years compared with eight (9%) of 92 controls. 115 However, another study that followed a birth cohort of 1246 children found that although lower respiratory tract infection in childhood was associated with an increased risk of recurrent wheezing, this association decreased with age and was not signifi cant by age 13 years. 116 Most children in this cohort had mild illness not requiring hospital admission, and severity of illness might be associated with the increased risk of asthma. 119 The question remains whether respiratory infection at a young age itself predisposes children to asthma through damage or alteration of lung function, or whether children with severe bronchiolitis might have individual risk factors (such as altered immune response or airway function) that predisposes them to both severe bronchiolitis and recurrent wheezing. 8",
