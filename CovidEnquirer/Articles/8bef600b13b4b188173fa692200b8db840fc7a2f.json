For example, it is customary to trim the eyes of dogs, cats, and rabbits in the vertical plane to sample the retina above and below the optic nerve. In contrast, primate eyes are trimmed in the horizontal plane, with the goal of sampling the optic papilla, the fovea, and the pupil in the same section. Small rodent eyes often are best prepared if not trimmed at all, allowing the experienced histotechnician to trim into the block until a section is obtained that samples the optic nerve and pupil together. From the biologic and anatomic perspectives, the eye has several special characteristics that must be considered when evaluating ocular tissues.",

Some but not all of the changes that are seen with cataract have morphologic correlates that are appreciable when examining routine tissue sections. Frustratingly, many other structural features of cataract cannot be distinguished from artifact, so the ocular clinical exam is more likely to rule out cataract than will a microscopic analysis of the lens. That said there are also instances where microscopy can detect morphology changes in lens fibers that might not be detected clinically. For example, the authors have diagnosed lens fiber swelling in rodent eyes in several studies in which no clinical evidence of cataract was observed.",

The size and rigidity of the globe have to be precisely matched with the refractive properties of the curved corneal surface and the location of the suspended lens such that light passing through the various ocular tissues is focused exactly on the retinal layer containing the photoreceptor outer segments. These properties are acquired during development and must be maintained in dynamic fashion throughout life if the function of the eye is to remain intact. In general, these properties depend on a precise balance in the production of molecules that help regulate the deposition and degradation of extracellular matrix. The pathologist, who views a static snapshot of heavily processed ocular anatomy, is only partially able to judge the likely integrity of optical focus and the preservation of such characteristics as the size and rigidity of the globe.",

            "text": "In order to maintain all the characteristics of optical clarity and precise interrelationships among the ocular tissues, a strict control of the ocular inflammatory response is essential. Whereas other tissues can overcome the effects of limited inflammation because of built-in redundancy, the function of the eye is dependent on maintaining exact structural relationships and physiological homeostasis, which are not easily preserved in the face of even minor and transient inflammation. The tissues of the eye are replete with built-in cytokines and immune regulatory factors which, alone or in combination, have the effect of downregulating inflammation. Among these, the secretion of transforming growth factor-beta 2 (TGF-b2) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) by the anterior uveal epithelium and corneal endothelial cells play a major role. In addition, the anterior chamber-associated immune deviation (ACAID) phenomenon is designed such that antigens presented in the anterior chamber are captured by intraocular antigen-presenting cells (APCs) which transfer them directly to the blood stream (via the trabecular meshwork) and present them to the spleen (Figure 53 .1). In the spleen, these eye-derived APCs selectively rest on the marginal zone and stimulate the production of T-regulatory cells (T reg ), which in turn suppress the initial activation of Th1 and Th2 effector cells, inducing tolerance to ocular antigens. The critical roles that these distinctive immunologic mechanisms play in ocular tissues have to be carefully considered when interpreting inflammation and immunologic properties in studies of ocular pathology. The potency of these novel immune regulatory pathways may obscure the relationship between cause and effect in the eye to a much greater extent than may be evident in other tissues. Table 53 .1 offers timelines for the comparative embryological development of the dog, mouse, and human. Since toxicologic pathologists use numerous different animals as test systems, we will refer the reader to the literature regarding embryology for select species. It is worthy of attention that, in experiments where the development of the eye is a central issue, the zebrafish offers an excellent model system as progression from a fertilized egg to a fully differentiated eye occurs in approximately 72 hours post-fertilization, which presents a very attractive timesaving model.",

Endoderm does not contribute to the formation of the eye. FIGURE 53.1 Anterior chamber-associated immune deviation (ACAID) system. Intraocular antigen (blue circles) is phagocytized by indigenous F4/80 \u00fe antigen-presenting cells (APCs [pale green stellate shapes]), which leave the eye through the trabecular meshwork and scleral veins. These cells present antigens to lymphocytes residing in the secondary lymphoid organs. In the spleen, APCs selectively home to the marginal zone where they recruit natural killer T cells (NKT) and produce an environment rich in thrombospondin, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-b), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and chemokine C-C motif ligand 5 (CCL5). This environment will in turn recruit CD4\u00fe and CD8\u00fe T-cells specific for ocular-derived antigens that, after interacting with the eye-derived APCs, will be transformed into CD4\u00fe and CD8\u00fe regulatory T cells (T reg ). The CD4\u00fe T reg (afferent T reg ) will inhibit the activation and transformation of na\u00efve T cells into T H 1 effector cells in the secondary lymphoid organs, and CD8\u00fe T reg (efferent T reg ) will inhibit the expression of a T H 1 response in the peripheral tissues, including the eye. In the thymus, APCs carrying ocular antigens interact with NKT cells, transforming them into NK1.1 Thy regulatory cells that migrate to the spleen and help in the transformation of CD4\u00fe and CD8\u00fe T cells into T reg cells. Furthermore, many of the types of cellular differentiation in ocular tissues represent completely unique pathways for the germ layer of origin that manifest through several surprising differentiation pathways. The surface ectoderm gives rise to multiple epithelial structures in and around the eye. The lens is the primary intraocular derivative, while the epithelium of the cornea is the only other major eye component arising from this embryonic layer. Periocular tissues that evolve from the surface ectoderm include the conjunctiva, the lacrimal gland, the adnexal glands (e.g., sebaceous [meibomian] glands in the eyelids), and the epidermis of the eyelids.",

Ocular developmental abnormalities are common in humans, domestic animals, and laboratory animals. They can be a part of hereditary disease processes passed on from generation to generation, or they can be the result of exposure to teratogenic compounds that affect development of the eye in utero without affecting the genome. In either case, ocular abnormalities can be limited to the eye or periocular tissues, but they are often part of systemic syndromes where the effect on ocular tissues is but one of many lesions induced in multiple organ systems. Toxicity studies often need to evaluate for either genotoxic or teratogenic potential, and evaluation of the developing eye in treated embryos has a role in modern toxicologic pathology. Although the mouse model is most often used for this assessment, the zebrafish model has many potential advantages, including the rapid pace of embryonic development, the transparency of fish embryos throughout the period of ocular embryogenesis, and the large numbers of offspring.",

Congenital cataract or abnormalities of lens size or position are other fairly frequent problems that may be observed in developmental toxicity studies (Figure 53 .3). We provide a list of known teratogenic substances affecting the eye in Table 53 While in vitro test systems are being used increasingly to probe relevant questions, none of the current methods for culturing ocular tissues can mimic the whole animal setting in performing these safety assessment functions. When choosing the most appropriate animal test system in an ocular toxicity experiment, many factors need to be considered. drainage system, the robust accommodation system, and the anatomy of the optic nerve. Also important is the tear film biology and the anatomy of the lids, including the adnexal glands and conjunctiva. The neurobiology of vision as assessed by visual-evoked potentials (VEP) and noninvasive imaging procedures of the brain is also optimally tested in the non-human primate. 4. Since rodents, rabbits, and dogs are also commonly used for ocular toxicity testing, some anatomic variations in these species should receive consideration prior to selecting an animal system for modeling the human eye. Albino rodents present many challenges with regard to their appropriateness in ocular toxicologic pathology. They are prone to retinal phototoxicity, which typically presents as marked retinal atrophy (Figure 53 .4) and blindness, and also exhibit drug distribution differences relative to pigmented eyes. The differences in drugs distribution are usually associated with drug binding by melanin, so they can be very difficult to characterize. Many rodent strains have heritable retinal degeneration as a background finding (e.g., the rd gene), so retinal morphology is substantially abnormal even in the control groups. Rabbits have distinctive tear biology owing to the lipid-rich secretions of the large Harderian gland, which protect the ocular surfaces without frequent blinking. However, this characteristic variation might impact topical drug distribution, absorption, and efficacy. Rabbits also have a unique retinal vasculature and optic nerve morphology which might impact glaucoma research if the optic nerve is the target tissue ( Figure 53 .5 ",

This property cannot be evaluated on a microscope slide. 2. Evaluation of emmetropia. Normal focus (emmetropia) requires the appropriate combination of ocular refraction by the lens and axial length of the globe. The quality of having an eye \"in focus\" can be evaluated by retinoscopy, a procedure using lenses to observe the pattern of fundic reflection. The morphologist is unable to make this determination. 3. Evaluation of tear formation. The Schirmer's tear test uses absorptive paper applied inside the conjunctival cul-de-sac to assess the production of tears. No comparable test can be done post-mortem, nor is this functional parameter subject to measurement by light microscopy. 4. Evaluation of corneal sensation. Sensory innervation to the eye is evaluated using an asthesiometer. This device quantifies minute differences in pressure applied directly to the corneal surface in the conscious animal, using the blink as an endpoint. 5. Fundoscopy. A well-designed non-clinical ocular toxicity study in which retinal effects are to be evaluated should include examination and photographic ocular imaging of the retina. Interpretation of data should rest with an individual who is both qualified and, ideally, masked to the identities of the treatment groups until the image interpretations are completed. When examining the fundus in the live animal, the clinician is essentially evaluating the gross pathology of the tissue. The advantage of fundoscopy is that the entire fundus is evaluated rather than a small (5-mm thick) section. Also, fundoscopic examination allows data collection at multiple points throughout the study, comparison between baseline images and post-treatment, retrospective analysis of data, and assessment of dose response changes and recovery of animals. 6. Fluorescein angiography. The small molecular size of fluorescein gives information about the integrity of the blood-retinal barrier in the living eye, which is not obtainable by other diagnostic means. The blood-retinal barrier in the eye is located in two places -the endothelial cell tight junctions in the retinal vessels, and the zonula adherens of the RPE cells. This barrier often breaks down in ocular inflammation; if introduced into the blood, fluorescein leakage will occur at points where the barrier is porous. The optic nerve can also leak when inflamed, even when it is not swollen. This property would not be apparent on color fundoscopic images alone. 7. Electroretinogram (ERG). It is not clear whether the functional integrity of the retina is better analyzed by morphology of the fixed eye or by examining the ERG in life.",

The commonly used fixatives for ocular tissues destined for microscopic evaluation are discussed below. aldehyde moieties. Therefore, it is an extremely effective crosslinking agent, but also will penetrate tissues at a much slower rate. In most cases, glutaraldehyde is combined with formaldehyde or paraformaldehyde, which will increase the speed of initial tissue penetration. Glutaraldehyde is the best fixative for TEM. It imparts excellent tissue rigidity and the native colors are preserved better than formalin, so site selection is easier when trimming. Unfortunately, glutaraldehyde has very poor tissue penetrating qualities, so tissues fixed should be no larger than 1 mm 3 . Whole rodent globes can be fixed in glutaraldehyde, but large animal globes must be opened before surface fixation can commence. Whole body perfusion should be considered if large amounts of tissue need to be fixed en bloc. Glutaraldehyde does not preserve well on the shelf, so it should be stored frozen (at \u00c020 C) and made up fresh before each use. To optimize the benefits of glutaraldehyde fixation, plastic embedding should be chosen rather than paraffin. Glutaraldehyde is very caustic when it contacts the skin. 5. Frozen tissue processing. When IHC is an essential procedure and fixed tissue provides inadequate preservation of labile antigens, or when preservation of enzymatic activity is needed for histochemistry, then tissues should be sectioned frozen on a cryostat. Tissues may be frozen without fixation or, more commonly, they may be fixed for a brief period (typically 30 minutes or less) in ice-cold formalin to improve cell morphology. Briefly, fixed specimens should be transferred to 20% sucrose in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline for 15 minutes and then dipped three times into a 1 : 1 mixture of 20% sucrose : tissue freezing medium. Next, the sample should be oriented in a cryomold surrounded by 100% freezing medium, frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogencooled isopentane , and stored at \u00c080 C until sectioning.",

These mice typically present with lymphocytic infiltration of the exocrine glands, increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines within tissues of the affected glands, and generation of autoantibodies to one or more molecules produced exclusively or mainly in these organs. Of those models, the more interesting are those derived from the non-obese (NOD) mice -NOD/Ltj and NOD.B10-H2 b -which develop autoimmune dacryoadenitis/keratoconjunctivitis sicca characterized by diminished production of tears associated with mixed infiltrates of T and B lymphocytes in the exorbital lacrimal gland that greatly resemble SjS.",

Lymphocytic clusters among acini are a fairly common background lesion in safety studies, especially in rodents.

This maintenance function is an important role of the constant, involuntary closure of the eyelids (\"blinking\") in primates and rodents, and/or the nictitating membrane in dogs, rabbits, and other species that have a third eyelid. Between blinks, gravity deforms the tear film by pulling it downward, with a meniscus forming at the lower lid. This sagging can create too much physical strain for the lipid layer to remain intact, so the three-layered tear film will break up until the next blink or excursion of the third eyelid. Paralysis of the blinking mechanism or exposure of the corneal surface beyond the reach of the closed eyelids degrades the tear film for extended periods of time and leads to keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Rabbits have a robust lipid layer which provides enhanced protection from the breakdown of the tear film between blinks.

The function of Bowman's membrane is not known. The bulk of the cornea is the stroma, which is located deep to Bowman's membrane (if one is present) or to the corneal epithelium ( Figure 53 .10). The transparent stroma, along with the opaque sclera, makes up the fibrous tunic of the globe. The junction of the fibrous zones in the cornea and sclera occurs at the limbus.",

However, the curvature of the cornea generally deviates from the spherical shape of the rest of the sclera. It is absolutely essential for retaining focus that the corneal curvature consistently varies in this fashion, as any imperfect areas will degrade the image on the retina.

It is secreted by the corneal endothelium (or posterior epithelium), the innermost layer of the cornea that borders the anterior chamber. The corneal endothelium is a monolayer of cuboidal epithelial cells, which has a similar microscopic anatomy and arrangement among mammalian species. The major difference among species is in the cellular density, which varies from 2211 cells/mm 2 in the rat to 4450 cells/mm 2 in non-human primates and humans. The endothelium is important in maintaining corneal transparency because it actively pumps water from the corneal stroma back into the anterior chamber against a steep pressure gradient. This linked leakage/pumping mechanism is an active process that provides for appropriate corneal nutrition from the aqueous humor in the anterior chamber while maintaining a normal degree of corneal hydration. The water content of the cornea is maintained at approximately 78%. A loss of endothelial function or breaks in its structural integrity leads to corneal edema, which is manifested as a translucent bluish quality to the corneal stroma during clinical evaluation or increased interfibrillar spacing within the stroma in histologic sections; the increase in fluid distorts the arrangement of the stromal fibers and disrupts the transparency of the cornea. The endothelium in most mammals is not renewable. There is attrition with age, and also when the cells are disrupted by intraocular surgery, lens luxation, or ocular trauma. If the endothelium is lost, it can only be restored, in humans, by transplantation ( Figure 53 .11).",

The most common acids that may be involved in ophthalmic injuries are sulfuric and sulfurous acids, chromic acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfur dioxide, and silver nitrate; the most common bases are calcium, magnesium, hydroxides of sodium, ammonium, and potassium. An acid burn to the cornea will coagulate the proteins from the epithelium and stroma. The precipitation of more superficial proteins either from the epithelium or stroma prevents acid substances, especially weak acids, from infiltrating more deeply into the stroma, which lessens the severity of the final lesions. This ameliorating effect does not occur with alkaline substances, as they will deeply penetrate the corneal tissue; thus they cause much more severe damage. The most severe base injuries to the eye are caused by alkalis with pH values greater than 12. On the corneal epithelium, alkalis cause saponification of fatty acids, cell membrane dissociation, and acute cell death leading to destruction and penetration of the epithelial layer. In the stroma, alkalis cause hydrolysis of proteoglycans and render the stromal matrix susceptible to enzymes such as collagenases from neutrophils and plasmin from damaged epithelial cells and fibroblasts, leading to lysis of the stroma. Interestingly, in contrast to acids and surfactants, alkalis tend to produce multifocal to focally extensive injuries presenting as a pattern of almost normal areas intermingled with deeply affected ones. Among these linear lesions, surfactants are also known to cause corneal irritation and tissue damage. Cationic surfactants generally tend to precipitate cellular proteins, with anionic agents causing cell lysis while non-ionic substances can cause either cell lysis or protein precipitation. The end result of chemical burns to the cornea is extensive scar formation and relatively widespread loss of transparency. The cumulative results of ocular irritation tests performed in rabbit corneas using many agents -acids, alkalis, surfactants and nonsurfactants like acetone, cyclohexanol, parafluoroaniline and formaldehyde -suggest that the extent of the initial injury (i.e., the depth to which the corneal tissue is affected) is significantly correlated with the subsequent tissue response and is the principal factor determining the final outcome of the ocular irritation. As mentioned before, neovascularization of the corneal stroma is regarded as a secondary phenomenon to corneal inflammation. It also can be seen as a background lesion in nude (Fox1 nu ) and hairless (hr) strains of mice. Application of certain molecules with trophic properties for vascular growth, such as VEGF or pro-inflammatory cytokines, may also promote the formation of new capillaries. In general, this response requires the agent to be present for a prolonged period (e.g., by slow release from an adjuvant depot or implanted wafer). As such depots are not typical means of applying ocular formulations and ophthalmic drugs do not have pro-angiogenic actions, this corneal change is not a typical toxic response in the clinical setting.",

The balance between secretion and drainage of the aqueous humor determines the IOP. Under normal conditions, this pressure is maintained at a relatively constant level of 15-20 mmHg in all mammalian species of interest for ocular toxicology research. Basic elements of this system are the trabecular meshwork, Schlemm's canal, the uveoscleral meshwork, and the aqueous veins.

The natural uvea is highly melanized to reduce light dispersion in the eye, and the presence of pigment also dampens the damaging effects of light-mediated chemical reactions to tissues in the eye. There are several reasons why albino rodents might not be the best choice for test species if the eye is a particular target for toxicity testing. First, albino mice and rats are exquisitely sensitive to retinal phototoxicity from exposure to only slightly increased levels of ambient light. Accordingly, the background level of retinal damage in controls is likely to be high. Furthermore, phototoxic retinopathy can have a dose and sex distribution that mimics a dose effect, especially in females. The albino uvea is also hypoplastic and vascular perfusion is decreased, which may impact the delivery of systemic toxicants and/or enhance the toxicity to metabolically borderline cell populations resulting from vascular perfusion problems. In addition, melanin protects against the damaging effects of ultraviolet light in the eye and often binds test substances, so the toxicokinetics of the albino rodent are likely to be quite different from those in the pigmented eyes of other species. Taken together, these discrepancies can result in ocular toxicity data sets that can lead erroneously to interpretations that a test article's effects are different (either less or greater) from the impression that would have been gained by conducting the study in a more appropriate test species or rodent strain.",

There are many disease states where the release of vasoproliferative cytokines leads to the formation of neovascular proliferation associated with the uvea. These membranes are seldom actually within the uveal tissue, but rather extend out along the surfaces of the iris, ciliary body, and/ or choroid. The aqueous, vitreous, or subretinal spaces also may harbor vascular proliferation. Such fibrovascular membranes can lead to synechiae (i.e., adherence of the iris to either the cornea [anterior synechia] or lens [posterior synechia]), iridocorneal angle closure, and/or hemorrhage. Retinal hypoxia as a result of restricted perfusion or retinal detachment is a common condition leading to the formation of these membranes, presumably because tissue hypoxia results in the local production of vascular-inducing growth factors. Intraocular inflammation, ocular trauma, and tumors in the eye are other possible causes. Neovascular glaucoma and choroidal neovascularization in the wet form of age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) are two examples of diseases associated with the intraocular release of excessive amounts of vasoproliferative molecules, particularly VEGF.

The most common mutations in mouse congenital cataracts are in genes coding for g-crystallins (Cryg gene). Some postnatal progressive cataracts have mutations in the b-crystallin (Cryb gene) encoding genes. Mutations of the a-crystallin (Cryaa and Cryab genes) also induce cataractous changes but with diverse phenotypes, with only the homozygous animals developing lesions. Mutations in genes coding for membrane proteins like major intrinsic protein (MIP) or connexins can also induce congenital cataracts. Mutations in genes coding for transcription factors such as FoxE3, Maf, Sox1, and Six5 also cause cataracts, among other ocular abnormalities. The cataractous changes in congenital cataract are predominantly observed in the lens nucleus, with near normal appearance of the cortical and equatorial lens associated with reduplication of the lens capsule. Regardless of the genetic event, the morphologic appearance of congenital cataracts is quite similar.",

The most readily apparent is a change in transparency, and this is the definition of cataract. A list of cataract-causing substances and their mechanisms of action is provided in Table 53 .5. Not all cataractous changes can be detected microscopically. A good example is changes in the lens nucleus (or core), which occur where lens fibers are no longer distinguishable as individual units. In addition, cataracts may be manifested histologically by changes that are the same as those which occur with certain artifacts. The most reliable histologic evidence of genuine cataracts includes swelling of lens fibers, formation of bladder cells and Morgagnian globules, and posterior migration of the lens epithelial cells adjacent to the posterior lens capsule (Figure 53.17) . Posterior migration of the lens epithelial is the initial morphologic finding in many early cataracts. It is particularly important that this initial change be recognized when screening for morphological phenotypes, especially in developmental cataracts. Bladder cells are formed when abnormal cellular metabolism in lens epithelium causes cytoplasmic accumulation of coarse granular material that causes the cells to swollen. When bladder cells lose their nuclei and become even more swollen, they receive the name Morgagnian globules. Mineralization is often seen with chronic cataract. Complete liquefaction of the lens fibers is another feature of chronic cataract, and is usually present in cases of hypermature lesions. The contents of the liquefied lens fibers have the potential of leaking from the capsule, and thus might incite an intraocular immune-mediated response culminating in uveitis. Lens epithelial cells can undergo spindle cell metaplasia and deposit collagen within the lens. These deposits are called subcapsular cataracts because the metaplastic LECs cling to the capsule. The metaplastic cells atrophy over time, and often only the collagen is left behind.",

If the external pressure of the zonular ligament is altered, this mechanical change also can cause cataract. The proliferating and differentiating lens epithelium is very sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) light, and also to a large number of toxic substances and disease states.

Chronic corticosteroid exposure can lower GSH levels in the lens, and therefore increase the risk of cataract associated with oxidative stress. Substances that affect cell mitosis, such as radiation or radiomimetic drugs, interfere with the organized stepwise differentiation of the lens cortex and can lead to cortical cataract, usually at the nuclear bow. Diabetic dogs and rats, but not mice, rabbits, or non-human primates, are at high risk of osmotic cataract formation. It is thought that the different risks among species are due to the fact that dogs and rats have relatively high levels of aldose reductase (AR) in the lens. This enzyme reduces various sugars (for example, glucose to sorbitol). Because sorbitol does not readily diffuse out of cells and its further oxidation (to fructose via the action of sorbital dehydrogenase) is slow, the accumulation of sorbitol in the hyperglycemic state would increase the intracellular osmotic pressure within the lens, leading to water retentiont and eventual rupture of the lens fiber cells. Therefore, rats and dogs that have high levels of AR in their lenses are prone to develop diabetic cataract, whereas mice that have low lens AR activity are not. Rats and dogs also develop galactose-induced cataracts readily. This is because the polyol of galactose reduction, galactol, is not further converted to other metabolites, resulting in faster build-up of this polyol and faster development of the osmotic cataract.",

The RPE actively transports nutrients such as amino acids, omega-3 fatty acids, and glucose to the outer retina across the tight junctions. In addition, the spent 11-trans form of retinol is taken up by the RPE after phototransduction and transformed back into functional 11-cis retinal so that it can be transported back to the photoreceptors. Interphotoreceptor-binding protein is secreted by the RPE and handles the transport of retinol between the photoreceptors and the RPE. The RPE also removes water from the retina and pumps it back to the choroid. The RPE engages in phagocytosis to remove the senescent outer discs of the rods and cones every morning, triggered by first light; the outer segments turn over entirely every 11 days by this mechanism. The RPE is important in maintaining immune privilege within the eye. The subretinal space is occupied by a specialized extracellular material referred to as interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM). The IPM is mainly composed of proteoglycans, and mediates key interactions between the photoreceptors and RPE, including adhesion, phagocytosis, outer segment stability, nutrient exchange, development, and Vitamin A trafficking in the visual cycle. The IPM also helps prevent vascular proliferation in the surrounding tissues.",

In the holangiotic arrangement, blood vessels traveling within the inner retina form a capillary network extending into the retina to the level of the outer plexiform layer, but not further into the inner retina than that. In non-human primates, the retinal vessels come from the central retinal artery, which, in turn is embedded directly in the optic nerve. Also in primates, there is a vessel-free zone within the center of the fovea such that there is no obstruction to vision. In mice, rats, and dogs, the retinal vessels penetrate from the ciliary arteries and never enter the optic nerve. In rabbits, retinal blood vessels are only seen in a horizontal line extending from the optic disc (medullary ray). Many of these vessels are not embedded in the retina but instead are within the vitreous, more specifically in a space between the vitreous and retina that is better visualized ultrastructurally. The rest of the retina is avascular. Many mammals have no endogenous retinal vessels (i.e., a parangiotic or anangiotic pattern).

            "text": "There are many different ways to evaluate retinal function and retinal morphology that are applicable to toxicologic studies. Like the skin, the retina is accessible for direct observation by fundoscopy. Ophthalmoscopic examination is a common component of toxicity testing protocols. Direct ophthalmoscopy is easy to learn, and most veterinarians employed to evaluate or care for animals in a testing facility would be expected to be comfortable with this procedure. During a study, any variance from the normal retinal architecture would trigger concern regarding the potential for toxicity. There are inherent problems with direct ophthalmoscopic examinations. The view of the fundus is greatly magnified (approximately 15-fold), and appears as an upright, or uninverted, image. Accordingly, competence in direct opthalmoscopy requires training and experience to be able to evaluate the fundus in a systematic manner and interpret the meaning of any variations from the norm. The indirect ophthalmoscopic examination is preferable for complete examination because of the ability to evaluate the entire fundus at only a modest degree of magnification (typically two-to five-fold), although the image is reversed. However, the indirect ophthalmoscope is not an instrument that is familiar to most non-specialist veterinarians. To maximize the benefit of fundoscopy, fundus photography can be important, both for documenting changes and for permitting a more detailed post hoc analysis. This allows comparison over time for a given individual and among animals, and it also can be very helpful in site selection for more detailed histopathology examination (Figure 53.22) . Again, few individuals are skilled in fundus photography, so such a focused procedure is likely to be chosen only when the eye is a likely target organ. Fluorescein angiography (FA) is a technique that allows assessment of the retinal and choroidal vasculature via fundoscopy and fundus photography. Fluorescein dye is delivered via intravascular injection into a peripheral vein, and the dye is traced through the eye by examination with blue light having a wavelength of 490 nm. Such functional attributes as vascular obstruction, leakage, hemorrhage, and venous clearance can be assessed. FA has proven to be the most important endpoint measurement in assessing the efficacy of treatments to control neovascular proliferation, an important aspect in the treatment of AMD (Figure 53.23) .",

This is a rapidly developing imaging modality, and higher-resolution images of impressive quality are achievable with modern instruments.

The latest models can image features as deep as the choroid. Since OCT is largely an imaging tool, its use in a toxicologic study will be defined by what information it can provide that is not available by conventional histopathology.

            "text": "Retinal histopathology remains the gold standard in evaluation of toxicity in the retina. The eye, and the retina in particular, present several challenges in the production of high-quality sections for histologic evaluation. The globe needs to be fixed intact unless there is an overriding reason to sample only selected parts of the eye. Opening the unfixed globe generally leads to retinal wrinkling and a loss of orientation among macroscopic features within the eye. Davidson's fixative has proven to be a superb choice to achieve excellent histological preparations of the retina, especially when electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry are not considerations in the study protocol. Rodent, dog, and rabbit eyes should be sectioned in the vertical plane so that the retina is sampled above and below the optic nerve. The goal is to have the optic nerve and the pupil in the section together. In contrast, primate eyes should be sectioned in the horizontal plane so that the optic nerve, fovea, and pupil are included in the same section. Large eyes should be trimmed prior to embedding to achieve these orientations, while mouse and rat eyes should be processed for embedding without trimming. Some method to identify the dorsal (superior) aspect of the globe is important so that the appropriate plane for trimming/embedding can be defined. When the retina is processed into paraffin after formalin fixation, artifacts characterized by little spatial defects within and adjacent to the retina may interfere with interpretation. With Davidson's fixative, which includes ethyl alcohol, these artifacts are avoided. Alternative fixative protocols for special procedures (e.g., electron microscopy) would use mixtures of paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde. Such concoctions are a suitable fixative for any experimental technique except immunohistochemistry, but they are essential for electron microscopy. To achieve the best ocular fixation for electron microscopy, intravascular perfusion fixation should be considered as the method of choice for initial fixation. This approach has the added advantage of opening up the vasculature. If immunohistochemistry is a priority, PLP fixative (4% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% periodate, and 1.2% lysine in 0.1-M phosphate buffer) has been recommended. However, cryostat sectioning of flash-frozen fresh tissue is the gold standard for ocular IHC.",

AMD affects the macula in humans, a cone-dense retinal region that mediates high-acuity vision. It is a degenerative condition that begins at Bruch's membrane and progresses to involve the RPE and outer retina. Histologically, the \"dry form\" is characterized by the accumulation of cellular debris (termed drusen), composed mainly of lipids, carbohydrates, and inflammatory proteins, within the Bruch's membrane. These deposits impair choriod-RPE transport and promote subsequent RPE and photoreceptor degeneration. The \"wet form\" of AMD is mainly characterized by formation of a subretinal neovascular membrane.

For example, the ABCR \u00c0/\u00c0 mouse, the ELOVL4 transgenic mouse, and the cathepsin D transgenic mouse are all examples of models that focus on altered RPE physiology. These mice develop impaired RPE metabolism culminating in cytoplasmic accumulation of lipofuscin and N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine (A2E), which in turn leads to RPE and photoreceptor degeneration. One characteristic of the Cfh \u00c0/\u00c0 , C3ar \u00c0/\u00c0 , and C5ar \u00c0/\u00c0 mouse models is the systemic deposition of the complement proteins C3a and C5a, which are components of drusen in humans and also stimulate choroidal neovascularization. These models exhibit loss of photoreceptors and reduced rod function. Ccl2 \u00c0/\u00c0 and Ccr2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice have decreased CCR2-mediated recruitment of macrophages from the circulation into tissues through complement stimulation, and were instrumental in demonstrating the relationship of AMD and complement deposition. These animals develop AMD-like pathology, when older than 16 months, characterized by drusen-like formations, RPE loss, choroidal neovascularization, and photoreceptor atrophy. It is accepted that oxidative stress along with inflammation also plays a role in the development of AMD. Sod \u00c0/\u00c0 , Sod2 \u00c0/\u00c0 , and ceruloplasmin/hephaestin double knockout mice present with AMD-like lesions ranging from sub-RPE deposits of debris to photoreceptor atrophy. Epidemiological associations between AMD and cardiovascular factors have prompted speculation regarding the role of lipids on AMD development, with conflicting results. The majority of models that explore this potential relationship have shown relatively modest sub-RPE deposits and Bruch's membrane thickening. Examples include APOE 3-Leiden transgenic, ApoE-null, and targeted APOE replacement strains of mice. Macular degeneration associated with drusen accumulation occurs spontaneously in rhesus and cynomolgus macaques, with differences in the pattern of inheritance and onset of lesions between the two species. The rhesus disease closely resembles human AMD, while the cynomolgus condition more closely approximates early-onset maculopathies. In the cynomolgus monkeys, symptoms appear at 2 years of age (early onset) and progress slowly. Lesions in this species are characterized by fine yellowwhite dots on fundoscopy, and RPE lipofuscin accumulation and complement (C5)-rich drusen between the RPE and choriocapillaris. The rhesus monkeys, which originated from Cayo Santiago Island in Puerto Rico, exhibit incidences of macular drusen of 50% at 9 years of age (adult onset) and 100% at 25 years.

However, atrophy or metaplasia of the RPE can also be a toxic effect. Retinal anatomy differs among mammalian species used for toxicity testing, and this needs to be understood when choosing an animal species for such testing. These differences include the type of blood supply, the presence of a fovea, and the presence of a tapetum lucidum. Toxic effects of the tapetal cells are not usually detected histologically; rather, they are observed as hyper-reflectivity of the fundus on the fundoscopic exam. It is important to identify this phenomenon and to differentiate it histologically from retinal lesions, since a toxic effect on just the tapetal cells would have limited significance in humans (Figure 53 .27).",

Many rodent strains are affected by hereditary retinal degeneration, such as Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rats or retinal degeneration (rd) mice. These animals are docile and make good experimental animals, but they lose essentially all of their photoreceptors as a normal background condition. Albino rodents are prone to photoreceptor loss in association with phototoxicity when exposed to high levels of blue light. Study protocols usually take this rodent idiosyncrasy into account. Nonetheless, in 2-year rodent bioassays, phototoxic changes are seen fairly frequently as a background change, especially in females. The authors have seen 2-year studies where phototoxic retinopathy in albino rodents has presented with a pattern suggesting a dependence on toxicant dose and sex. We think that this phenomenon is associated with slightly stronger light levels combined with an otherwise trivial compound-related effect on one of the pathways associated with phototoxicity, such as oxidative stress or apoptosis, rather than overt ocular toxicity by the test agent alone. In rats, a clue that the change is phototoxicity rather than retinal toxicity is an unusual vascular proliferation seen in the RPE layer of the retina (Figure 53.4) .",

Of the commonly used laboratory animals, the mouse is the only one that does not have a distinct lamina cribrosa. The rat exhibits single bundles of collagen forming a delicate lamina cribrosa, while non-human primates, pigs, dogs, and cats possess a robust lamina cribrosa comparable to humans (Figure 53 .31). That said, the composition and structure of the lamina cribrosa is similar in primates and rats.

Gliosis is a common but non-specific reaction of the optic nerve neuropil to many different insults, and can be a sign of early disease. Liquefactive necrosis (malacia) of the optic nerve occurs in association with ischemic (e.g., retrobulbar hemorrhage secondary to blood collection) or inflammatory insults. Necrosis is one of the initial optic nerve alterations seen in acute cases of glaucoma, and also is very common in suppurative intraocular inflammation that involves the retina and extends into the optic nerve. As in other parts of the CNS, liquefaction of the optic nerve leads to infiltration with macrophages (\"gitter cells\"), many of which may contain eosinophilic intracytoplasmic debris believed to be myelin. As a consequence of optic nerve head necrosis in association with high intraocular pressure seen in glaucoma, the optic nerve collapses at the lamina cribrosa and the residual nerve tissue is displaced caudally into the sclera (an effect called optic nerve cupping). In some cases, a focal loss of optic nerve neuropil allows the vitreous to prolapse into the optic nerve trunk to form a cavitated lesion that is termed Schnabel's cavernous atrophy.

Affected offspring will develop cyclopia (a single or two fused eyes), holoprosencephaly (a common forebrain rather than twin cerebral hemispheres), and optic nerve aplasia (see Embryo and Fetus, Chapter 62). Optic nerve aplasia and hypoplasia are also observed in ZRDCT-An mice and in netrin-1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. Coloboma, a congenital abnormality in which there is segmental aplasia of optic nerve, retina, and choroid, is found in many mouse mutations. Among them are Microphthalmia (Mitf mi ), Belly spot and tail (Bst), Coloboma (Cm) and Total cataract and microphthamia (Tcm).

            "text": "8 Microscopic Alterations Produced by Some Compounds Retinotoxic to Rodents Photoreceptors degenerate, and the choriocapillaris atrophies. The primary event in iodate retinal toxicity is RPE cell necrosis followed by photoreceptor cell apoptosis. The mechanism of toxicity is not clear, but inhibition of lysosomal enzymes may play an important pathogenic role in the RPE lesion. Iodoacetate, an inhibitor of glycolysis, is highly retinotoxic. High intravenous doses of iodoacetate to rabbits cause injury of rods and also affect phagocytic activity of RPE cells. Recently, a new pig model of inherited retinal dystrophy has been devised by administering a single intravenous dose of iodoacetic acid. Marked photoreceptor degeneration arises after 2-5 weeks.Lead poisoning can cause lipofuscin accumulation in RPE cells of rabbits, leading to outer retinal degeneration. The presumed mechanism is chronic oxidative stress. Methanol (or its by-product formic acid) ingestion in humans and non-human primates can result in outer retinal toxicity. In contrast, retinal toxicity can be produced in rats only by inhibiting formate oxidation, which occurs much more rapidly in this species and thus prevents the accumulation of formic acid. Methanol toxicity in rats shows that both mitochondrial disruption and cellular atrophy occur in the outer retina. 4,4 0 -methylenedianiline is an intermediate in the production of isocyanates and polyurethanes. It causes retinal toxicity in pigmented and non-pigmented guinea pigs when inhaled, inducing degeneration of the photoreceptor inner and outer segments as well as the RPE. Retinal toxicity also occurs in cats exposed though oral or parenteral routes. N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) is an alkylating agent considered to be mutagenic. It is well known to cause congenital malformations including anophthalmia, microphthalmia, and tumors in various locations, especially the nervous system. Chronic exposure to high doses is retinotoxic in guinea pigs and rats. In rats, photoreceptors undergo degeneration early, with subsequent degeneration of RPE cells. A single high dose of ENU recently has been reported to cause outer retinal atrophy in adult BALB/c mice. Naphthalene is better known to cause cataracts, but it is also retinotoxic. After oral administration to rabbits, the chief lesion is RPE degeneration. Nitroaniline, a rodenticide, causes retinal toxicity in humans, rabbits, and hamsters. The changes of note following oral administration are related to degeneration in the RPE and photoreceptors.Organophosphates inhibit cholinesterase and are commonly used as pesticides. Retinal degeneration and histological abnormalities of the RPE have been reported in some cases of toxicity, but this finding has been difficult to reproduce. Diburyl oxalate delivered subcutaneously to rabbits induces the formation of needle-like birefringent crystals in the cytoplasm of RPE cells, as well as in other organs (e.g., kidney, heart, testes). The crystalline deposits in the RPE can be detected as white flecks on the retina by indirect ophthalmoscopy. Histologically, RPE cells exhibit varied numbers of Pizzalato stain-positive (calcium oxalate), intracellular, needle-like crystals that often coalesce to form a single large deposit. Phenothiazines tranquilizers, including derivatives such as piperidylchlorophenothiazine, thioridazine, and chlorpromazine, can cause clinically significant retinopathy in humans. Retinal toxicity also can be induced in cats, but not in rabbits, rats, guinea pigs, or dogs. Photoreceptor cells, particularly the rod outer segments, are the target tissue. The main lesion is degeneration of the outer segments of photoreceptor leading to thinning of the photoreceptor layer. The RPE cells undergo secondary hypertrophy via cytoplasmic accumulation of lipofuscin, melanolysosomes, and curvilinear bodies. Atrophy of the RPE layer is seen in the end-stage lesion. Phenothiazines bind to melanin and accumulate within the uvea and RPE.",
