In addition, PLpro shows significant in vitro deubiquitinating and de-ISGylating activities. All these findings demonstrated the multifunctional nature of the PLpro. Here we report the sensitivity of PLpro to denaturant urea. An increase in urea concentration induced a reversible biphasic unfolding of the enzyme. Differently, the unfolding of the catalytic triad region located within the palm and thumb domains followed a monophasic unfolding curve. Further observations suggest that the zinc-binding domain may start to unfold during the first transition. An 80% lost of its enzymatic activity at a urea concentration lower than 1 M showed a close correlation with unfolding of the zinc-binding domain. The enzyme was also characterized in terms of hydrophobicity and size-and-shape distribution. We have demonstrated that PLpro displayed differential domain structure stability and molten globule state in its folding. These studies will not only assist in our understanding of the folding of this viral enzyme, but also that of other deubiquitinating enzymes with a similar scaffold.",

Over the next 2 years, the discovery of two more species of human CoV, NL-63 and HCoV-HKU1, confirmed the high mutation rate of coronaviruses [2, 3] . Recent isolation of SARS-CoV like strains from bats further raises the possibility of a reemergence of SARS or a related disease [4, 5] .

Both proteases are suitable antiviral targets because they are essential for viral maturation [7, 8] . Besides the proteolytic activity that is common to the main protease, PLpro also showed significant deubiquitinating (DUB) and de-ISGylating activities with obscure biological functions [9] . Recently, cellular assays have also suggested that coronaviral PLpro is able to antagonize the induction of type I interferon, which is independent of its protease and DUB activity [10] . All of these studies support the multifunctional nature of the PLpro and suggested that these independent activities may provide multiple targets for antiviral therapies.",

Both of them share a papain-like fold that contains palm, thumb, and fingers domains (Fig. 1A) . The active site of PLpro is located within the palm and thumb domains consisting of a catalytic triad of cysteine, histidine, and aspartic acid residues [9] . A fourstrand anti-parallel b-sheet makes up the ''fingers'' domain. Within the fingertips region there are four cysteine residues coordinating to a zinc ion.

Initially we analyzed the catalytic activities of PLpro with and without the Ub like domain. Their kinetic parameters are summarized in Table 1 . The k cat of PLpro-(1600-1858) is slightly higher than that of PLpro- (1541-1858) , while the K m of PLpro-(1541-1858) is about 2.5-fold lower and k cat /K m is twofold higher. The results indicated that their catalytic abilities are quite comparable. The results suggested that the PLpro-(1600-1858) fragment, which contains the palm, thumb, and zinc-finger domain (Fig. 1A) , is sufficient and active in terms of catalysis.

Under the excitation at 280 nm, the fluorescence emission spectrum of the native enzyme shows a maximum at 346 nm (Supplemental Fig. 1 , solid curve). In the presence of 7 M urea, the enzyme was completely unfolded after 1 h and the maximum emission had shifted to 357 nm (Supplemental Fig. 1, short dashed curve) . After 50-fold dilution of the urea and incubation for 10 min, refolding of the enzyme was induced to give a yield of 88% as judged by the fluorescence spectrum recovery (Supplemental Fig. 1, dotted curve) .

When the integrated fluorescence area was calculated, a monophasic unfolding process was obtained (Fig. 2B ). There is a strong denaturant dependent pretransition slope, which might indicate exposure of hydrophobic areas [14, 26] . Similarly, the fluorescence emission peak showed a monophasic red shifting from 345 to 360 nm (Fig. 2C) . By fitting these results to the two-state unfolding model, the overall tertiary structural unfolding of PLpro was found to have reached an unfolding intermediate with a [Urea] 0.5,N\u00c0U at 4.8 M, which is very close to that of secondary structural unfolding (Table 2) . Further interesting results are shown in Fig. 2D , where there is an obvious biphasic red shift of the AEW from 349 to 352 nm upon increasing the urea. The data fit to the three-state unfolding model very well, which suggest that the folded enzyme started to unfold at a very few urea and reached the first unfolding intermediate with a We try to characterize the intermediate state between 1 and 3.5 M urea further. Unlike 18 tyrosine residues randomly distributed in PLpro, there are only two tryptophan residues (W1633 and W1646) and both of them are near the active site (Fig. 1) . The tryptophan fluorescence thus is an excellent tool to probe the unfolding of the thumb and palm domain (Fig. 2E) . A monophasic unfolding process with a [Urea] 0.5,N\u00c0U at 4.7 M similar to those from CD and fluorescence peak shifting indicated that the unfolding of the catalytic core occurs during the second transition (Table  2 ). To find out the possible region that may unfold in the first transition, the temperature factors of the residues from the PLpro structure were analyzed (Fig. 1B) . The higher temperature factor of the zinc-binding domain than other regions suggests that the first transition may be due to its unfolding.",

Comparing to those of PLpro with endogenous zinc, [Urea] 0.5,N\u00c0U of PLpro without metal ion show a 0.8-1.1 M decrease.

By continuous c(s, f/f 0 ) distribution analysis, the native PLpro showed a single species of s = 2.9, which corresponds to a monomer (Supplemental Fig. 5B ). The size distributions of the enzyme at various urea concentrations were then analyzed (Supplemental Fig. 5C-H) . As the urea increase, the sedimentation coefficient of the major species showed a clearly decrease from 2.9 to 1.0 (Fig. 3, triangles) . Multi-peaks distribution at 1.1 M urea (Supplemental Fig. 5D ) and an asymmetric peak shape at 2.0 M urea (Supplemental Fig. 5E ) suggest a dynamically size-and-shape change during the intermediate state [18, 23] . Furthermore, the shape distributions of the PLpro's major species at various urea concentrations were analyzed in terms of their f/f 0 distribution (Fig. 3, color contour) . The f/f 0 of the native PLpro was between 1 and 3, while that of the most concentrated region (shown by red) was below 1.5. Before the second unfolding phase (1-3.5 M urea) , the broad f/f 0 distribution of the major species suggested a tendency to elongate among the unfolding process, which is similar to that of the SARS-CoV main protease in guanidinium chloride [14] . Based on previous studies, the partial unfolding intermediate may represent a molten globule state with exposure of the interior hydrophobic area, which will allow a pronounced binding of ANS, a broad f/f 0 , and higher propensity to aggregate [14, 27] . Indeed, at lower protein concentrations of PLpro (<6.5 lM), there is significant aggregation at 3.5 M urea. The ANS binding activity of the urea-unfolded enzyme also showed a significant hydrophobic region exposure between 3 and 4 M urea (Supplemental Fig. 4) . All of these results support the presence of a major intermediate form detectable at urea concentrations between 1 and 3.5 M that may only represent a molten globule state after 2.5 M urea. Thus, during the first unfold state and the first half of the intermediate state, the possibility remains that differential domain stability occurs. Above 4.7 M urea, the PLpro showed a sedimentation coefficient of 1.0-1.5 and the f/f 0 of the most concentrated region was close to 2 (Fig. 3) . The small sedimentation coefficient and large f/f 0 suggested a totally unfolded protein structure [14, 16] .",

The results shown in Fig. 3 (circles) are those for residual enzyme activity by the peptide cleavage assay and similar results were obtained by the DUB assays (data not shown). Interestingly, the enzyme activity began to decrease at very low urea concentrations (50% left at 0.5 M urea). By the time that 1.1 M urea has been reached, there was only 20% of the original activity left. Besides, to identify the influence of endogenous zinc ion, the enzyme activity was also examined in various concentrations of EDTA. The activity was 90% in 10 mM, 50% in 50 mM, while the lowest one was 38% left in 100 mM EDTA. These results support the hypothesis that the first transition, which is caused by the unfolding of zinc-binding site, already has a great deal of influence on activity even when the active core domain still remains folded. According to the modeled structure by Ratia et al. [11] , the finger region of PLpro may be used to cradle the body of ubiquitin. It suggested that the zinc-binding site may stabilize the finger region and its unfolding can be detrimental to substrate binding and cause the loss of the activity. Taken together, our studies provide evidence that the structural integrity of zinc-binding site is essential for the enzyme activity [9, 11] .",

            "text": "In summary, our studies have revealed the reversible unfolding/ refolding process of the PLpro in the presence of urea (Fig. 4) . The zinc-binding domain of the enzyme may start to unfold at urea concentration below 0.35 M and reaches a first plateau at 1-3.5 M. At this stage, the palm and thumb core domains remain well folded but totally inactive. Remove of zinc ion from the enzyme will cause the tertiary structure more unstable and a two-state unfolding. This supports the hypothesis that the zinc-binding domain can stabilize the structure and is essential for the catalysis [9] . As the urea concentration is increased above 3.5 M, the unfolding of the palm and thumb domain then starts and this involves significant hydrophobic exposure and is completed at 7.5 M urea. This schematic representation only includes the major enzyme species that occur during the folding process. Specifically, PLpro displays a differential stability in terms of the protein's domain structures and a molten globule state is present at the beginning of palm and thumb domain unfolding. Differential domain stability can also be seen in SARS-CoV main protease, while other proteins, such as human alkaline phosphatase, human apolipoprotein E, and malic enzyme have been shown to undergo a significant molten globule transition state during the unfolding process [14, 16, 28, 29] . Our unfolding studies on SARS-CoV PLpro will not only assist in our understanding of the structure folding of this important viral enzyme, but also that of other DUB enzymes with a similar scaffold but low sequence identities, such as HAUSP, USP-2, USP-14 etc. [30] [31] [32] [33] . In the intermediate state, the zinc ion is lost due to the zinc binding motif unfolding. Without zinc ion, PLpro will follow a two-state unfolding and is more unstable.",
