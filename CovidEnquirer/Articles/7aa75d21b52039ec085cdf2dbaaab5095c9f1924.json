This was the second novel swine enteric coronavirus detected in the US since May 2013. In this study, we conducted retrospective testing of samples submitted to three veterinary diagnostic laboratories where qualifying biological samples were derived from previously submitted diagnostic case submissions from US commercial swine farms with a clinical history of enteric disease or from cases that had been previously tested for transmissible gastroenteritis virus, PEDV, or rotavirus. Overall, 2286 banked samples were tested from 27 States. Samples were collected in 3 separate years and in 17 different months. Test results revealed 4 positive samples, 3 collected in August 2013 and 1 collected in October 2013. In addition, a case series including 42 operations in 10 States was conducted through administration of a survey. Survey data collected included information on characteristics of swine operations that had experienced PDCoV clinical signs. Special emphasis was placed on obtaining descriptive estimates of biosecurity practices and disease status over time of each operation. Clinical signs of PDCoV were reported to be similar to those of PEDV. The average number of animals on each operation exhibiting clinical signs (morbidity) and the average number of case fatalities was greatest for suckling and weaned pigs. Average operationlevel weaned pig morbidity was greatest in the first week of the outbreak while average operation-level suckling pig case fatality was greatest in the second week of the outbreak. The survey included questions regarding biosecurity practices for visitors and operation employees; trucks, equipment and drivers; and feed sources. These questions attempted to identify a likely pathway of introduction of PDCoV onto the operations surveyed.",

In June 2014, the USDA published a Federal Order mandating the reporting of PEDV and PDCoV by producers, veterinarians and laboratories. The Federal Order required the inclusion of premises identifier data to allow for more accurate monitoring of disease incidence and spread.

Up to 50 cases per month per lab and up to 2 samples per case could be included. Samples from the same case could be pooled in groups of 5. Samples were tested from each month in the date range and from as wide a geographic distribution as possible. Each sample result was to be accompanied by the date of sample collection, State in which the farm submitting samples was located, operation type (sow/boar, nursery, suckling, and grower/finisher) and, the results of any previous diagnostic testing.

There was room in the questionnaire for identification of only two types of ill pigs. When there were more than two types of pigs ill on the operation that observation was split. This resulted in additional rows of data being created using the original farm identification number. Operation level information was replicated in the second row but animal information differed to reflect the third or more ill animal type. This resulted in 56 observations in the final edited dataset rather than the original 42. For subsequent operation level estimations such as average inventory, only one observation was used and identified as operation type. Estimates of morbidity, case fatality, and clinical signs were included and identified as ill pig type.

Most operations, independent of operation type, experienced PEDV infection before PDCoV infection. Participants were asked if changes to biosecurity protocols were made in response to either this operation becoming infected with PEDV or concerns about PEDV in general (Tables 4 and 5) . Specific changes to protocols of personnel entering the pig facilities due to prior PEDV infection included applying disinfectant to the entry mat, requiring hand sanitizer, placing lunches in double bags, requiring use of rubber boots, prohibiting cell phones from entering pig facilities, requiring disposable boots and foot baths, requiring semen deliveries be made off site, and changing down time for employees from 48 to 72 h. Responses for changes to protocols for trucks, equipment and drivers due to prior PEDV infection included biosecurity reviews, delivery and pickup route changes, increased down time for trucks, and requiring trucks to always be washed and disinfected and dried for 24 h and in some cases heated. Responses for changes to feeding practices included changing premix vendors, flushing feed lines after mixing diets that contained porcine products, and eliminating all or some porcine products from the feed (e.g porcine sprayed dried plasma).",

Participants were asked if in the 10 days before the onset of PDCoV if someone from a foreign country visited the operation and if someone from this operation, who works with pigs (including their veterinarian or their partners), returned from a foreign country. For all operation types, 100% of operations responded that no visitors from foreign countries visited the site and 88.9% and 11.1% responded that no one from their operation who works with pigs visited a foreign country or they did not know if they had visited a foreign country respectively. In the 10 days before the onset of clinical signs of PDCoV, 22.2, 33.3 and 59.3% of Farrow to Finish, Farrow to Feeder and breeding operations had non-employees enter the pig facilities. For sites that had any visitors during the 10 days before the onset of PDCoV, Table 6 shows the percentage of sites by number of visits of each type of visitor.",

It has been suggested that the PDCoV, similar to other enteric coronaviruses in swine, does not survive well in warmer temperatures. The earliest detections in August and October may not have propagated or spread rapidly across the US due to warm summer and fall temperatures.",

Others have speculated that the virus has been silently circulating prior to and in-between these times and remained undetected by clinical observations because it is less virulent resulting in milder signs than the PEDV. Thachil et al. (2015) described a new ELISA test for PDCoV and following retrospective serological testing of 395 banked samples submitted for gastrointestinal disease with this ELISA suggested that PDCoV has been present in the US since 2010. The results from this serologic testing are based on an estimated test specificity of 95%, based on a negative population cohort of 30 animals. The confidence interval was not provided in this report. We investigated reported clinical signs, morbidity and case fatality associated with PDCoV in the participating herds, particularly for suckling age pigs. Comparisons to other morbidity and case fatality data are made with published estimates of PEDV morbidity and case fatality since those for PDCoV are lacking. The first published mortality figures associated with PEDV were reported to be 90-95% mortality in suckling pigs which is numerically higher than our highest value of 44.2% (Stevenson et al., 2013) . Similar mortality was found by others (Schlueter et al., 2015; Dufrense and Robbins, 2014) . Results from farms in the study reported here suggest that case fatality for PDCoV is lower in pre-weaned pigs than found with PEDV.",

There has not been a separate effort to update this research for PDCoV. Most sites had multiple deliveries of feed, company service person visits, and renderer entry. Most also had pigs picked up for some reason such as permanent removal to an abattoir. Lowe et al. (2014) described how this stream is a concern since the prevalence of PEDV in vehicles leaving a harvest facility appeared to increase as the prevalence of contaminated trucks came into the facility. It is fortunate that sites in the study changed truck protocol to include trailer heating based on the work of Thomas et al. (2013) . Other researchers suggest that the transportation of dead animals (e.g., rendering) inherently has a high risk for transmission of PEDV and probably PDCoV (Henry, 2014) . There has been a focus on feed as a source for transmission of PEDV since an early investigation (Nugent, 2015) . In a survival analysis done on incidence data from North Carolina, having a feed truck enter a premise increased the probability of PEDV infection 44%.",
