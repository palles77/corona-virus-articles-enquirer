Transfection of MARC-145 cells with capped in vitro transcripts derived from a full-length cDNA clone of the viral genome resulted in infectious PRRSV with growth characteristics similar to that of the parental virus. Primer extension analysis revealed that during replication, the viral polymerase corrected the two nonviral guanosine residues present at the 5V terminus of the transfected transcripts. Animal studies showed that the cloned virus induced hyperthermia, persistent viremia, and antibody response, similar to that observed with the parental virus. Contact transmission occurred rapidly within 3 days of introduction of na\u00efve pigs into the group of clone virus-inoculated pigs. These results suggest that the cloned virus retains the in vivo virulence and contagion properties of the parental virus, thus, providing the background for reverse genetics manipulation in systematic examination of attenuation and virulence phenotypes.

The genome is translationally active and is organized into 5V-terminal open reading frames (ORFs) encoding nonstructural proteins, ORF1a and ORF1b, which are proteolytically processed to generate replicase proteins. The 3V-terminal ORFs 2 -7 encode, in succession, the glycoproteins 2-5, the matrix (M) protein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein. Immediately following release into the cytoplasm, the genomic RNA is translated into ORF1a and ORF1ab polyproteins. The latter is translated via a -1 pseudoknotmediated ribosomal frameshift. Both ORF1a and ORF1ab polyproteins are processed to generate at least 12 individual mature proteins. The viral replicase complex replicates the genomic RNA into a negative-sense intermediate that in turn serves as the template for generation of progeny genomic RNA. The replicase also generates a nested set of negative-sense subgenomic (sg) RNAs. These sgRNAs (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1990; Sethna et al., 1989) serve as templates for generation of 5V-and 3V-coterminal positive-sense sgmRNAs encoding ORF2-7 structural proteins, which participate in viral assembly and also are responsible for viral antigenicity (Conzelmann et al., 1993; Meulenberg et al., 1995 Meulenberg et al., , 1997 . It is thought that replication and transcription occurs along double membrane compartments within the host cell (Pol et al., 1997) .",

To determine the genome sequence of this PRRSV, we utilized RT-PCR to generate five overlapping cDNA fragments (amplicons) encompassing the entire length of the genome (Fig. 1A) . These five amplicons (A, B, 5C, 3C, and D) were individually cloned into the lowcopy plasmid, pBR322. Primers (Table 1 ) used in amplification incorporated specific restriction enzyme sites to facilitate cloning. The top and bottom strands of 6 -12 clones of each amplicon were sequenced. Thus, the consensus sequence was derived for each nucleotide position with 12-to 24-fold redundancy. Additionally, the overlapping regions between each amplicon, which contained artificial sequences introduced by primers used in the initial RT-PCR, were cloned and sequenced similarly with primer pairs representing the newly determined consensus sequences. Authentic 5V-terminal sequences of the PRRSV genome were obtained by RLM-RACE and subsequent sequence analysis of six individual clones. Amplicon A, which contained the 5Vend of the genome, was repaired to reflect the authentic viral sequences.",

Two additional guanosine residues were introduced between the T7 promoter and the first nucleotide of the viral genome to facilitate efficient transcription by T7 RNA polymerase. On the basis of the previous report from Nielsen et al. (2003) demonstrating that 40 adenosine residues at the 3V terminus of the viral genome were sufficient to recover infectious virus, we incorporated a poly(A) tail of 41 residues at the 3V end of fragment D. Further details of the construction of the fulllength cDNA clone have been described in Materials and methods. Clones were screened to ensure insertion of fragments in the correct orientation, and three full-length cDNA genome were amplified to generate the cDNA fragments A, B, 5C, 3C, and D. Fragment D was amplified to introduce 41 adenosines at the 3V terminus. The T7 RNA polymerase promoter (A10) was inserted upstream of viral genomic 5V-terminal sequences in fragment A. Restriction enzyme sites used for cloning are listed below the fragments. (B) cDNA fragments with the consensus amino acid sequence were selected for assembly of the full-length clone in pBR322.

These symptoms were expressed in our experiment by lethargy, lack of appetite, roughness of hair coat, occasional sneezing, some coughing, and some diarrhea most of which started within 48 h postinoculation. The intensity and duration of the symptoms seemed to correlate closely with the kinetics of the development and the intensity of hyperthermia (Fig. 5A) . The vFL12-inoculated group exhibited a hyperthermic peak that was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than the temperature baseline in the sham-inoculated control group, specifically from days 3 to 6 postinoculation. Interestingly, in the parental virus-inoculated group, which also developed some degree of hyperthermia, the thermal peak was less promi-nent, modestly rising above the normal temperature curve registered for the sham-inoculated group. The symptoms exhibited by the vFL12-inoculated group were the more prominent of the two groups as observed by the amount of food left unconsumed or the degree of alertness of the animals. In addition, the higher severity of the disease observed in the vFL12-inoculated group was further evidenced by the fact that one of the animals died of typical secondary complications to PRRSV infection at 23 dpi. A necropsy and diagnostic workup on this animal showed immunohistochemical detection of PRRSV in several tissues and histopathological lesions suggestive of colonization by Streptococcus suis or Salmonella. Infectious vFL12 was isolated from multiple tissues, including lymph nodes, lung, spleen, and kidney. The parental virus-inoculated group exhibited milder symptoms of infection although the shaminoculated control group remained healthy during the study period.",

By the end of the observation period at 22 days postinoculation, a detectable viremia, a titer above the 10 1.5 TCID 50 /ml detection threshold of the assay, was still evident in two of the animals of the vFL12-inoculated group and in three animals of the parental virus-inoculated groups. Further evidence of in vivo replication was obtained by analysis of the PRRSV specific seroconversion, as indicated by the curve of S/P ratios from the commercial Idexx ELISA kit.

Virus isolated from the parental virus-inoculated pig did not contain the BsrGI site. When two sentinels were introduced at day 19 postinoculation into the group infected with vFL12, rapid horizontal transmission occurred. Virus was detected in one sentinel within 3 days of contact although both sentinels were viremic by day 8. On the other hand, the parental virus was transmitted only after 3 weeks of cohabitation. Importantly, the identity of the transmitted virus as being vFL12 was unequivocally demonstrated by the presence of the genetic marker (Fig. 5D, right panel) , thus confirming that the genetic stability of the cloned virus is a feature maintained both within and between animals.",

            "text": "In this report, we describe the complete nucleotide sequence of the viral genome and the construction of infectious cDNA clone, FL12, for a highly pathogenic, North American isolate of PRRSV. Transfection of capped in vitro transcripts, derived from this clone, directly into MARC-145 cells led to efficient recovery of infectious virus from cultured cells. Indeed, at day 5 posttransfection, CPE was observed in transfected cells. Robust recovery of the virus was further evident by detection of CPE in cells infected with culture supernatant from transfected cells. Cloned virus, vFL12, displayed similar growth properties to its parent virus in MARC-145 cells, in PAMs, and in the animal host. More significantly, animal studies showed that vFL12 and the parental virus rescued from cultured cells induced similar patterns of viremia and seroconversion. Furthermore, we observed horizontal transmission of vFL12 from infected to sentinel pigs by as early as day 3 after cohabitation. Detection of the BsrGI genetic marker indicates that vFL12 remained genetically stable during passage in cells, multiple rounds of replication in inoculated pigs, and after secondary transmission to sentinel pigs. Since its initial isolation in the early 1990s in North America and Europe, PRRSV has become endemic in virtually every swine farming nation and has emerged as a significant economic menace within the swine industry. The most feasible approach to thwarting the virus exists in vaccination. Production of first generation vaccines has resulted in wide immunizations on both continents. However, it is becoming evident that currently available vaccine strains are unstable and sometimes revert to virulent phenotypes in vaccinated animals (Key et al., 2003; Mengeling et al., 1999; Nielsen et al., 2002; Opriessnig et al., 2002) . Thus, development of vaccine strains from multiple passages in tissue culture may not be effective. Rather development of attenuated strains through reverse genetics manipulation of viral full-length recombinant cDNA clones would provide greater predictability in phenotype outcome and host immunization efficacy. With the advent of infectious cDNA clones for Lelystad virus and VR-2332, such studies will be possible. Here, we have reported the development of an infectious cDNA clone for a highly pathogenic North American strain of PRRSV that appears to resemble its parent strain, closely, in terms of its growth and pathogenic properties. This reagent will play an important role in our endeavor toward understanding the determinants of virulence of this significant swine pathogen.",

The authors speculated that it was possible that incorporation of nonviral guanosine residues at the 5V terminus of the viral genome may have contributed to diminished growth capacity of the cloned virus. However, our primer extension analysis suggests that the viral RNA polymerase possesses inherent property to correct the 5V-terminal nonviral residues during replication.

Our in vitro and in vivo data, specifically enhanced growth of vFL12 in MARC-145 cells and macrophages, clinical signs (i.e. hyperthermia), enhanced ability to excrete through mucous membranes and transmit to uninfected sentinels, and immune response kinetics, suggest that vFL12 may represent one of the most virulent populations within quasispecies of the parental virus.",

Using dideoxy-chain terminator sequencing chemistries (Sanger et al., 1977) and an Applied Biosystems 3730 automated DNA sequencer (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA), DNA templates were sequenced bidirectionally with forward and reverse primers. Bases were called using Phred (version 0.020425.c) , which also produced a quality file containing a predicted probability of error at each base position. DNA sequences were assembled with Phrap (version 0.990329) ) using the quality files and default settings to produce a consensus sequence with some manual editing using Consed (version 13) sequence editor (Gordon et al., 1998) .",

The 3V terminus was modified to introduce an AclI restriction enzyme site for linearization of the template before in vitro transcription. Ligation and transformation was performed following the standard procedures described by Sambrook et al. (1989) . All plasmids were propagated in E. coli DH5a. Plasmids containing fragments 5C and 3C were combined via an XbaI site and the new recombinant was fused with the plasmid containing fragment B using a shared Bsu36I site. This intermediate recombinant plasmid was digested with BsrGI to release a 12.3-kb fragment, which was cloned into the BsrGI site of the repaired pAD. The resulting plasmid, pFL, contained the sequences of the entire viral genome under the control of T7 RNA polymerase promoter in the vector pBR322. Both strands of three full-length clones were sequenced for accuracy. All three clones contained the consensus sequences and in vitro transcripts from all three clones were shown to produce infectious virus. Clone #12, pFL12, was used in the studies reported here.",

The pigs were consistent with negative serology for PRRSV and absent in clinical history of the disease. Three groups of four animals were used. One group was inoculated with a total dose of 10 5.2 TCID 50 /2 ml of PRRSV NVSL #97-7895 (parental virus) instilled intranasally (1 ml in each nostril). Another group was inoculated in a similar manner using a similar dose of vFL12 (second passage on MARC-145 cells). A third group of animals was sham-inoculated with cell culture medium (DMEM with 10% FBS). The three groups of animals were housed in strict isolation from each other using animal housing facilities compatible with biosafety level-2 conditions, including negative pressure environment to prevent any possible cross-infection between groups. On a daily basis, the animals were clinically inspected and their body temperatures were recorded from 2 days pre-until 16 days postinfection (dpi). Sequential blood samples were collected from all the animals at 4, 7, 14, and 22 dpi and used to verify levels of viremia and kinetics of PRRSV-specific antibody development using a validated commercial ELISA kit (Idexx Labs, Portand, ME). Blood samples were used to detect PRRSV by conventional viral isolation on MARC-145 cells, as previously described (Bastos et al., 2004) . Likewise, virus obtained from viremic sera, from both cloned and parental PRRSV-inoculated groups, were used for RT-PCR amplification and analyzed for the presence of BsrGI site that differentiates the clone from the parental virus. Virus transmissibility studies were undertaken with each of the two PRRSV-inoculated groups following a previously published protocol . Briefly, at 19 dpi, two additional PRRSV-free animals, homogeneous with the rest of the animals in size and origin, were introduced into the two PRRSV-inoculated groups to act as sentinels of contagion. These animals were sampled together with the rest of the group for evidence of animalto-animal transmission by viremia and PRRSV serology. Also, in the case of viremia, serum samples were used for molecular analysis of the genetic marker, as described above.",

Three groups of pigs (four pigs per group) were sham-inoculated or inoculated with either vParental or vFL12 at TCID 50 /ml of 10 5.2 and 10 4.8 , respectively. (A) Temperatures were recorded daily from 2 days before inoculation to 16 dpi. Average temperatures from four different animals in each group are shown. (B) Serum samples were collected at 4, 7, 14, and 22 dpi and virus titers were determined and expressed as TCID 50 /ml. Values represent average titers from four animals. (C) Serum antibody titers were determined with the Idexx ELISA kit. Values represent average titers from four animals. Dashed line at 0.4 S/P ratio designates threshold value above which titers are considered positive for anti-PRRSV antibodies. Error bars in panels A, B, and C represent standard deviation. (D) Serum from 14 dpi, recovered from inoculated animals, was used to distinguish between vFL12 and vParental by examining for the presence of the BsrGI genetic tag (left panel). Viral RNA extracted from sera was amplified by RT-PCR and the products were digested with BsrGI. Similar analysis (lane 7) was performed with virus in serum from a sentinel pig at 8 days postcohabitation with pigs infected with vFL12 (right panel). Gel image is inverted.
