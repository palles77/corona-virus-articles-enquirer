Scope: Epidemiology studies spatiotemporal patterns of illness in populations and the factors affecting it. An epidemic emerges out of the population activities and environment. Task assignment is a common activity in many realms where sub-tasks are created, delegated, and collectively carried out to achieve the original task. Due to its complexity and context, task assignment can be a challenging activity that can result in limited outcomes. This research studies task assignment as an epidemic assigned to a distributed system. We have developed computational models to understand the outbreak of aerosol-borne diseases by using the agent-based modelling approach. Experiments are carried out to observe the patterns of emergence during the spread of disease among the individuals and get insights of their mechanisms. These mechanisms are used to design algorithms for task assignment on distributed systems. Results: Understanding the emergent behaviour of diseases can provide the platform for the development of distributed algorithms that can be helpful in overcoming some of the challenges of task assignment in a distributed system.",

Moreover, the 1918 flu pandemic in U.S.A was responsible for more deaths than even the World War I itself 2 . In last 50 years the world has seen the epidemics caused by HIV/ AIDS, SARS, influenza and many others. According to the World Health Organization website, every year around 15 million people die due to infectious diseases which eventually leads to epidemics 3 . Since epidemics is a big challenge in front of human society, the interest in studying possible solutions to prevent or control any kind of epidemic outbreaks has been developed among the research community. Epidemiology is the formal branch of science that specially focuses on the study of emergence or spread of disease. Technically Epidemiology is \"the study of the occurrence and distribution of health-related events, states, and processes in specified populations, including the study of the determinants influencing such processes, and the application of this knowledge to control relevant health problems 1 .\"",

Traditionally the field of epidemiology has been widely limited to studying the past events, but with the help of Computational Epidemiology researchers have the power of predicting the future in unique ways.

Distributed systems is the collection of independent systems that appears as a single coherent system to its users 7 . Since a distributed system has number of interconnected processors or nodes, task allocation is one interesting problem to solve. The problem is to find an effective and optimal way to allocate a given task among different processors to maximize the system reliability. Many researchers have taken a lot of interest in a path of solving this problem of task allocation. With this work, we have applied our learning from SARS as a complex adaptive system to design algorithms for task allocation in a distributed system. Other researchers have also taken an inspiration from nature to solve the problem of task allocation 8, 9 , but this work highly focuses on reduction of the overall cost of task allocation by understanding the inter-system behaviour and non-linearity of distributed system rather than just following conventional sequential approach.",

These factors are then modelled using the agent-based modelling approach by using the NetLogo simulation software 14 . People are the agents in our epidemiology-based model and an artificial breed of population is randomly created. The person's immunity, current health condition, and closeness with other agents in the environment have been modelled. This model uses the data and alerts which were issued by the WHO 10 and the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 11 during the SARS epidemic. Based on these data, several SARS stages have been inferred as shown in Table 1 The emergence of SARS virus is quite interesting, for instance it took less than 2 days for the SARS virus to migrate from China to Canada 12 with important societal consequences. Due to this property of spreading fast, studying SARS emergence by modeling and simulation can be helpful in developing an algorithm for task allocation in distributed systems. Task allocation is the system property that emerge within the distributed system following insights from the SARS pandemics. In this research we have followed an unorthodox approach of assuming the spread of SARS virus among the population as the assigned task to the system, and the number of patient getting infected or sick due to virus are interpreted as completion of the task.",

We have considered a system comprising of a set of n processors, P = {P1, P2\u2026., Pn}; and a task T that needs to be allocated over the system. The global task of \"Software Update\" is used to instantiate the epidemiology-based distributed algorithm. The \"Software Update\" task has been generated by one of the processors and the challenge is to update each and every other processor with the software update in an efficient, cheap and faster way. The optimal task assignment procedure over the system increases the system reliability by immediately disseminating the update. The task allocation procedure consists of inter-process communication, intra-process communication, message passing, and task execution processes which make it a very costly procedure. The main aim of this work is to reduce the overall cost of task allocation by reducing the cost (e.g. processing time, communication time, etc.) of the above mentioned individual procedures.",

The virus can be interpreted as a necessary task which is needed to be assigned to every node in the network. The close contact among the people in epidemics can be interpreted as a trust factor among the different nodes in the distributed system. Since the agents follow random motion in the epidemic model, a susceptible person might come within a 3-meter radius or close contact of an infected person. This is translated as a transaction in the form of messages or other communications among the nodes of the distributed system. One node can have a number of transactions with several other nodes in the system.

In a distributed system the immunity for nodes is the free computing and free memory capacity available in the node. The available memory and computing capacity varies based on the circumstances. Hence as suggested in the algorithm, if the required parameters match, the processing starts which can be related to the infected phase of SARS. Whereas in some cases, due to a lack of processing and memory available, the package will be inactive. This is the latent phase for that node, where the package is present in the system but it is waiting for required computing capacity and memory space to activate.",

If the \"Isolation\" is ON, it means that a peer cannot share the package with any other peers to its close contact in the network. Using the \"Isolation\" factor in this model, the speed of task assignment can be controlled.

Although we consider a variety of factors in the spread of the disease, there can be other social factors (e.g. personal decisions) that may also prove to be relevant for the spread of the disease. This paper focused on the modeling of the SARS pandemic and the identification of relevant factors and dependencies, which can be used in the design of a task assignment algorithm for a distributed system. Future work will implement the algorithm and evaluate its performance.",

The paper evaluates several factors on the SARS pandemics from a CAS perspective. This is very useful because it provides several insights and inspiration used to develop an algorithm for the task assignment problem in a distributed system. The number of people getting infected or dying of the disease were interpreted as task completed, while the people not getting affected were represented as incompetence of the algorithm. The model was designed so as to find out the factors contributing to the rise of disease and further exploiting these factors to get better efficiency from the system. As the end result of this model we have designed the algorithm for distributed system we call it \"Epidemiology based Task Assignment algorithm\".",
