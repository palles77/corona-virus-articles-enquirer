We detected inflammation and myonecrosis at the parenteral site and hyperplasia of the draining lymph nodes. MVA-MERS-S did not result in detectable lesions in tissues peripheral to the parenteral site and draining lymph nodes. Real-time PCR analysis of > 240 tissue samples detected MVA-DNA predominantly at the injection site and in the draining lymph nodes, and suggested continuous clearance of the candidate vaccine during the observation period. Levels of parenteral site inflammation and hyperplasia of draining lymph nodes were considered in line with immunological responses to vaccine inoculation.",

Here we wished to generate additional preclinical data on the in vivo distribution of MVA-MERS-S in order to prepare for the evaluation of the MVA-MERS-S vector vaccine in a first-in-man phase I clinical trial. This 'biodistribution' of a candidate vaccine is important to estimate risks potentially associated with an in vivo application of the virus. Relevant aspects include monitoring for signs of virus replication and for potential side effects of the vaccination in the selected animal model. For instance, a dispersion of virus from the parenteral site of inoculation to excretory organs could be indicative of possible viral shedding and spillover into the general environment. Although MVA has been investigated as a safe vector vaccine candidate for years, there are not many studies regarding distribution in sites peripheral to the administration site.",

Anti-VACV-IHC did not reveal antigen in any of the analyzed peripheral tissues underlining the incompetence of MVA to result in generalized spreading. Inoculation of mice with the control virus MVA-GFP-mCherry produced a reaction pattern indistinguishable from MVA-MERS-S underlining the maintenance of a well confined vector virus infection. Moreover, the limited distribution of MVA-MERS-S was further confirmed by the results of the qPCR analysis detecting relevant amounts of MVA-DNA only at the injection site and in draining lymph nodes. In three animals, high Ct-values of MVA-DNA were obtained in lung and liver. These PCR signals can probably be attributed to marginal quantities of vector DNA, which was dislodged from the parenteral site. Similar studies also detected minimal amounts of vector DNA in single organs, however, attempts of MVA re-isolation were negative [6, 8] . Therefore, it seems unlikely that these signals represent viable virions.",

The degree and extent of inflammation and myonecrosis in this study is in accordance with the ratio of inoculum volume in relation to parenteral site (mouse muscle) volume, which is expected to be considerably smaller in human vaccinees.
