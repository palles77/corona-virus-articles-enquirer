This resulted in the recognition by the Chinese government of the economic importance of tourism. Other large events such as China's accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001, the 2008 Olympic Games and the 2010 World Expo to be held in Beijing and Shanghai, respectively, project an image of potential to hotel investors. However, the hotel industry is not as promising as hotel investors may expect. First, the supply of hotel rooms has increased exponentially due to the lack of long-term plans on hotel development in most tourist attractions (Lam and Mao, 2001) . Second, many hotels in China are run by the management of individual hotels, not international hotel chains. Therefore, they do not enjoy a prestigious brand name, an efficient reservation system and economies of scale, such as centralized advertising. For example, hotels in Shanghai are faced with an enormously competitive environment. Given the depression in the real estate market, many real estate developers have changed their original development plans for building offices, apartments and villas into building hotels. And numerous guesthouses and large-scale training centres were reconstructed to become hotels. This means there is presently an imbalance between supply and demand. Consequently the profit margins of hotels, particularly four and five-star hotels have dropped significantly. In responding to these challenges, some hotels have attempted to adopt a range of strategies to sustain competitiveness, such as reducing operating expenditures by downsizing and laying off employees. Others are attempting to develop strategic relationships with external agents that have the necessary expertise to operate certain functions through franchising, contracting out or by leasing arrangements.",

Although some studies address outsourcing (e.g., Hemmington and King, 2000; Lankford and Parsa, 1999; Embleton and Wright, 1998; McIvor, 2000; Khatri and Budhwar, 2002; Jennings, 2002) , they rarely do so in relation to hotels in China. Therefore, the significance of this study is to identify outsourcing strategy as perceived by hotel managers in Shanghai. The objectives were fourfold: predetermined external provision with another enterprise for the delivery of goods and/or services that would previously have been offered in-house (Elfing and Baven, 1994; Domberger, 1998; Klien, 1999; Finlay and King, 1999) . Outsourcing may be a result of market competition, with enterprises aiming to obtain selected goods and services from an outside organization to become cost-effective (Engelke, 1996) . In this study hotel outsourcing is defined as a management strategy in which a hotel utilizes a specialized outsourcing supplier, forming strategic alliances with it to have the supplier operate certain hotel functions, in an attempt to reduce costs and risks and improve efficiency. This allows the hotel to focus efforts on its core competency and strengthen its ability to adapt in the ever-changing business environment.",

            "text": "Outsourcing has been in a continuous use in numerous industry sectors in China since it gained impetus in the latter half of the 1980s in the emerging service sector (Whang, 1992; Quinn and Hilmer, 1994; Reyniers and Tapiero, 1995; Cheon et al., 1995; Ang and Straub, 1998) . The main operational functions to be outsourced are normally related to accounting, maintenance, security, promotion and storage (Burt and Pinkerton, 1996) . Previous studies have shown that the decision of ''make-orbuy'' or ''in-source versus out-source'' is related to organizational behaviour (Loh and Venkatraman, 1992; Elfing and Baven, 1994; Venkatraman and Loh, 1994; Alpar and Saharia, 1995; Carlson, 1989; Hart, 1995) , and transactional cost economics (Benko, 1993; Boon and Verberk, 1991; Lacity and Hirschheim, 1993) . Lonsdale and Cox (1997) argued that few organizations treated outsourcing as a strategy for long-term development. Gilley and Rasheed (2000) had a similar opinion and commented that outsourcing does not always involve a real strategic long-term approach to management. On the contrary, Lonsdale and Cox stated that many used it for reducing short-term operating costs. However, some studies have found that contrary to expectations, outsourcing does not actually decrease costs and in some cases, it increases costs (Hall and Domberger, 1995; Domberger, 1998) . In China the business environment for hotels is enormously competitive. To survive hotels have to think strategically in terms of lifting productivity, improving the bottom line and satisfying hotel guests. Unfortunately there is a serious lack of know-how among hotel managers. Contracting out certain hotel functions to external experts can be a way to achieve such goals. Yet, the hotel managers are generally shortsighted, hoping that the experts can share the costs and management risks, and generate profits for the hotels in a short period of time. Some scholars argue that outsourcing is more than cost cutting. Tom (2001) argued that outsourcing is where an organization and an outsourcing expert put their limited resources into the most important project, and each side makes great efforts to utilize its strength to obtain a win-win result.",

Such initiatives usually generate internal fear and employee resistance (Domberger, 1998) as job security is jeopardized. And, the existing organizational culture is disturbed when an external outsourcing agent enters the hotel (Hemmington and King, 2000) . Thus it will affect collaboration between the hotel and the agent when the respective cultures are not compatible to achieving their objectives (Goolsby, 2001) . Such cultural clashes are usually regarded as a factor contributing to the failure of outsourcing. Zhao (2001) states that Chinese organizational culture is power-driven and emphasizes emotions, relationships and harmonious working conditions. This is distinguished from Western organization culture which he sees as putting more weight on mutual respect and the actual performance of individual entities. A successful outsourcing supplier is likely to be one that can adapt to Chinese organizational culture.",

They can be categorized as follows: state-owned, collectively owned, shareholding ventures, Sino-foreign joint ventures and wholly foreign-owned enterprises. According to He (1994) state-owned enterprises are publicly owned in the sense that the manufactured products are totally owned by the workers. Collective-owned enterprises are similar to state-owned ones except that the ownership of the enterprise and its products are owned by certain groups of workers, but not all. Shareholding enterprises, as the name depicts, are owned by shareholders who are responsible for their own profits and losses. Sino-foreign joint ventures are co-invested and co-managed by the Chinese and the foreign parties that jointly share the profits and losses. The last type of hotel ownership is the wholly foreign-owned. These enterprises are wholly invested in and independently managed by the foreign investor. It may be reasonably assumed that the disparity of hotel ownership types, business missions and objectives normally leads to different perceptions towards the adoption of an outsourcing strategy. Some people may focus on contractual prices while others emphasize the quality of production and services delivered by outsourcing suppliers.",

Furthermore, if a hotel function was outsourced to a supplier, a Others refers to those not belonging to the above five types of hotel ownership. For example, some hotels were state-owned but their management functions were contracted out to external vendors. respondents believed that the hotel could better utilize the resources previously devoted to that function in other operations (m \u00bc 5:77), and the supplier could generate more revenues for the hotel (m \u00bc 5:64). It seemed that technology was not greatly demanded of outsourcing suppliers from hotel operations. Normally, if hotels intended to introduce technology to support a production or service, they would approach technology consultants who have genuine specialist knowledge in this area rather than outsource to a supplier. Therefore, it was not surprising to find that ''utilizing the advanced production technology technique provided by outsourcing supplier'' (m \u00bc 4:77) was ranked the lowest in this study. Table 3 describes the factors preventing hotels from using outsourcing suppliers. It was found that respondents were most concerned about the incomplete laws for protecting hotels if the outsourcing suppliers failed to fulfill their duties (m \u00bc 4:99), followed by the lack of reliable outsourcing suppliers in the market (m \u00bc 4:74). Lacking experience (m \u00bc 4:65) and understanding of outsourcing (m \u00bc 4:58) were other important hindrances to adoption of outsourcing. In fact, outsourcing is a new concept for hotels in China nowadays. It is uncommon for hotels, particularly the state-owned type, to consider outsourcing part of their hotel functions to external providers. There are two possible reasons. First, labour costs are perceived to be low in China when compared to those in developed countries or regions. Hotel management may have rarely thought of relying on outsourcing suppliers to run the business for them for cost-saving purposes. Second, outsourcing seems to be impossible in state-owned hotels where employees are protected by the ''iron rice bowl'' employment system. Given the system, employees are assigned to hotels by the state. This promises permanent employment, and job security. The recruitment, allocation to firms, issue of employment permits, and transferal or dismissal of employees under the ''iron rice bowl'' system are all subject to official approval of the state personnel departments (Zhu, 1995) . Thus, outsourcing is not commonly adopted by hotels in China where laying off employees is still very difficult. a The maximum score is 5 and the minimum score 1; the higher the score, the greater the extent to which the respondents agreed.",

As shown in Table 5 , two significant results were found. First, the factors of contractual price and contract duration were significantly related to the ownership status of a hotel. Shareholding hotels were more concerned about contractual prices and contract duration than were stateowned and collectively owned hotels. The result can be explained by the fact that in China, shareholding hotels, unlike the latter two types of hotel ownership, do not receive any subsidies or support from the government in the case of deficits in the balance sheet leading to possible business failure. Therefore, costs and incurring risks were the most important areas of concern if outsourcing was adopted. Second, stateowned, collectively owned, and shareholding hotels would place more emphasis on whether their corporate culture supported the smooth adoption of outsourcing than would wholly foreign-owned hotels. Zhao (2001) stated that traditional Chinese corporate culture emphasizes power, authority, stability, and relationships among employees. However, transferring management power and authority from a hotel to an external outsourcing supplier may imply that some unfavorable measures such as lay-offs, early retirement, and reallocation of manpower that may deteriorate the corporate culture may go along with the outsourcing. Therefore, these three types of hotel ownership as dominated by Chinese management rated corporate culture a higher degree of concern.",

It was found that senior managers (i.e., level of divisional manager or above) would consider more seriously the supplier's past performance, brand name and capability than would departmental managers when outsourcing suppliers were chosen. Possibly, there was a difference in perception on outsourcing strategy between senior managers and departmental managers. It appeared that senior managers were more aware of the long-term strategic purpose of outsourcing and the long-term strategic factors such as suppliers' capability in delivering quality service, maintaining service standards, and developing new markets in the long run. Such different perceptions should be handled carefully to ensure that a common goal is reached. Otherwise, conflicts between these two groups of managers may arise. ",

The findings of this study indicated that external outsourcing suppliers were expected to help hotels reduce the risk of business failure. The incompleteness of laws to protect hotel investors when business conflicts occur between hotels and outsourcing suppliers, and the incompatibility of corporate cultures between hotels dominated by Chinese managers and outsourcing suppliers were a hindrance to the adoption of a successful outsourcing strategy. Furthermore, shareholding hotels were found to be more concerned about contractual prices and contract duration than state-owned and collectively owned hotels. Senior hotel managers were also more aware of the long-term strategic purpose of outsourcing.",

However, outsourcing usually incurs redundancy of employees or reallocation of internal resources that may lead to high employee turnover, poor morale, and low productivity in the mid-term period. In the long run, the hotel industry in China may be affected since the outsourcing industry is expected to grow exponentially in the future. Hotel talents and specialists will then be drawn from hotels to outsourcing suppliers. Having said that, the expanding hotel market has become very competitive in China nowadays. The unforeseen severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) breaking out in Asia in early 2003 has forced the hotel management to focus on every possible short-term cost saving strategy immediately. Thus, it is expected that outsourcing activity will gradually become popular among hotels in China. Meanwhile, increasing demands for outsourcing will urge the Chinese government to introduce complete laws to protect all parties involved in outsourcing activities in the future. The results were presented as the mean scores of the adoption factors; the higher the mean scores, the higher the degree of agreement (1=strongly disagree, 2=disagree, 3=somewhat disagree, 4=neutral, 5=somewhat agree, 6=agree, 7=strongly agree). a State-owned, collectively owned or shareholding hotels fully managed or franchised by foreign hotel management corporations are categorized as ''Others''. b Denotes significant differences in mean score between sub-group testing at po0:05 level.

Since outsourcing involves external suppliers helping to operate certain functions of the hotel, the corporate cultures of the hotel and the supplier may be incompatible because of different business missions, objectives, and strategies between the two parties. Therefore, cultural conflicts may occur to weaken their relationship. Two-way communication should be strengthened between the hotel and the supplier to improve mutual understanding and develop a relationship of trust. Regular meetings should be held, and formal and informal gatherings can be organized. All problems, opinions, comments, suggestions, and even compliments should be addressed openly and frankly between the two parties. This will help to resolve possible hidden problems, if any, in a timely manner, before they erupt into conflict. * Senior management should try to get departmental managers involved in the whole process of implementing outsourcing, from the planning to controlling stages. Involvement may help the managers understand the strategic purpose and mechanism of outsourcing, and allow them to work together to monitor the exercise of outsourcing. * The outsourcing market is immature, indicating that there are few quality outsourcing suppliers in China at the moment. Hotel management had difficulty identifying reliable and capable suppliers. Yet, it is important that hotel management should consider the supplier's expertise, past performance, and The results were presented as the mean scores of the adoption factors; the higher the mean scores, the higher the degree of agreement (1=strongly disagree, 2=disagree, 3=somewhat disagree, 4=neutral, 5=somewhat agree, 6=agree, 7=strongly agree). a Denotes significant differences in mean score between sub-group testing at po0:05 level.",
