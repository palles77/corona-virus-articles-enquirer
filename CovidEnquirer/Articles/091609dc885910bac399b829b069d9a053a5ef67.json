            "text": "Oxidized phospholipids in control of inflammation and endothelial barrier PANFENG FU and KONSTANTIN G. BIRUKOV CHICAGO, ILL The levels of circulating oxidized phospholipids (OxPLs) become increased in chronic and acute pathologic conditions such as hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, increased intimamedia thickness in the patients with systemic Lupus erythematosus, vascular balloon injury, acute lung injury (ALI), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). These pathologies are associated with inflammation and activation of endothelial cells. Depending on the biological context and the specific group of phospholipid oxidation products, OxPL may exhibit both proinflammatory and antiinflammatory effects. This review will summarize the data showing a dual role of OxPL in modulation of chronic and acute inflammation as well as OxPL effects on pulmonary endothelial permeability. Recent reports show protective effects of OxPL in the models of endotoxin and ventilator-induced ALI and suggest a potential for using OxPL-derived cyclopenthenone-containing compounds with barrier-protective properties for drug design. These compounds may represent a new group of therapeutic agents for the treatment of lung syndromes associated with acute inflammation and lung vascular leak.

The cell membrane and low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) are enriched in phospholipids that contain polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are highly prone to oxidative modification. The formation of OxPL is initiated either by enzymes, such as lipoxygenase, or by reactive oxygen species (ROS). OxPL has been detected in human atherosclerotic lesions and the aortas of cholesterol-fed and heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits. 3, 4, 7 One major phospholipid present in plasma membrane and minimally modified LDL (MM-LDL) is 1palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (PAPC), which generates a heterogeneous group of oxygenated full-length products or compounds during oxidation with truncated oxidized residues present at the sn-2 position. Biologically active ''fragmented OxPL,'' in which the sn-2 fatty acid residues are oxidatively truncated, include 1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleroyl)sn-glycero-phosphocholine (POVPC), 1-palmitoyl-2glutaroyl-sn-glycero-phosphocholine (PGPC), and 5keto-6-octendioic acid eater of 2-lyso-phosphocholine (KOdiA-PC). The other group of OxPLs, such as 1-palmitoyl-2-(5,6-epoxyisoprostane E2)-sn-glycero-3phsphocholine (PEIPC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-(5,6-epoxycyclopentenone)-sn-glycero-3-phsphocholine (PECPC), represents ''oxygenated OxPL,'' which is generated through the addition of oxygen atoms to the sn-2 fatty acid residues. The chemical structures of these biologically active OxPL are shown in Fig 1. In addition to phosphatidylcholine, other classes of OxPL that contain different polar heads and fatty acids, such as 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine (PAPE) and 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-snglycero-3-phosphatidylserine (PAPS), may undergo oxidative modification. This structural diversity accounts for a remarkable variety of biological activities of OxPL, which are described below.",

Furthermore, even molecules that contain a similar sn-2-fragmented residue exhibit different activities. POVPC and PGPC contain u-aldehyde and u-carboxyl groups, respectively. POVPC increases monocyte but not neutrophil binding to ECs. 3 In addition, POVPC strongly inhibits the lipopolysaccharide-mediated induction of neutrophil binding and expression of E-selectin protein and messenger RNA (mRNA). 3 In contrast, PGPC induces both monocyte and neutrophil binding as well as the expression of the E-selectin and the vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1). 11",

            "text": "G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). It has previously been shown that OxPL may act by binding to a GPCR. Parhami et al 12 demonstrated that the treatment of aortic ECs with MM-LDL resulted in a saturable dose-dependent increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. The cAMP increase in response to MM-LDL treatment was caused by the stimulation of Gs complexes and inhibition of Gi complexes. Subsequent studies revealed involvement of different GPCR in the OxPL-mediated signaling pathway. During nonenzymatic deacylation and enzymatic hydrolysis, oxidized fatty acyl chains can be released from the sn-2 position of OxPL. Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A 2 , which is also known as platelet-activation factor (PAF)-acetylhydrolase, catalyzes the conversion of OxPL into lysophospholipids, which can bind and activate various GPCRs. For example, lysophosphatidyl-choline activates GPR4 and G2A receptors, [13] [14] [15] whereas lysophosphatidic acid stimulates LPA1-LPA4 receptors. 16, 17 Furthermore, some OxPLs have a similar structure to PAF and are considered as potential PAF receptor agonists. The major PAF-like lipid in oxidated LDL (OxLDL) is 1-O-hexadecyl-2-(butanoyl or butenoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. 18 The activation of the PAF receptor by the OxPL resulted in IL-8 expression and monocyte binding to ECs. 19, 20 However, some OxPL effects cannot be reproduced by the activation of the PAF receptor. As a well-recognized edemagenic agent, PAF does not mimic the barrier-protective effects of oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (OxPAPC) 21 as well as induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by OxPAPC, 22 which suggests the involvement of receptor mechanisms rather than the PAF receptor. More recently, a Gs-coupled GPCR, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has been implicated in the activation of beta-1 integrin and the stimulation of monocyte binding to ECs induced by OxPAPC and PEIPC. 23 Butaprost, which is the specific agonist of PGE2, mimicked the effect of OxPAPC on the regulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa) and IL-10 in monocyte-derived cells. 23 Furthermore, EP2 antagonist AH6809 blocked the activation of EP2 by OxPAPC in HEK293 cells and blocked the IL-10 response to PEIPC in monocytic THP-1 cells. 23 Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). A line of evidence shows that PPAR g, which is a nuclear receptor protein that plays an essential role in the regulation of genes, was activated by a fragmented alkyl phospholipid in OxLDL called hexadecyl azelaoyl phosphatidylcholine. 24 In addition to PPARg, PPARa may be also activated by OxPL or its components POVPC and PGPC. Furthermore, by using transient transfection assays, Delerive et al 25 demonstrated that OxLDL but not LDL activated PPARa dose dependently in ECs without affecting PPARa protein expression. Inhibitory analysis showed that phospholipase A2 but not lipoxygenases or cyclooxygenases was required for this activation. 25 Scavenger receptors. CD36, which is an 88-kD transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on monocytes/macrophages, platelets, and microvascular endothelium, has been implicated as a putative receptor for OxLDL. [26] [27] [28] More recently, the acyl chains of OxPL that protrude from the plasma membrane were defined as a key recognition site for macrophage binding to the cell surface. Two conserved, positively charged amino acids in CD36 (lysines at positions of 164 and 166) are critical for OxPL and OxLDL binding to CD36. 29 In contrast to the implication of CD36 in OxLDL recognition by macrophage, work by Walton et al 30 demonstrated that IL-8 induction by OxPAPC is independent of CD36 and mediated by toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and a 37-kDa glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein.",

            "text": "Extravasation and activation of monocytes. A characteristic feature of atherosclerosis is the accumulation of lipids in the lesion area. Numerous studies have clearly demonstrated that OxPL activates monocyte binding to the vascular EC; the initial event triggers vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis plaque formation and induces synthesis of monocyte-specific chemoattractants such as monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP1) and monocyte/EC adhesion proteins. 8 Connecting segment 1 (CS1) fibronectin is an endothelial membrane protein that binds monocyte integrin a4b1, which causes the firm adhesion of monocyte with ECs. 11 OxPAPC promotes the surface deposition of the CS-1 fibronectin, which is mediated by increased R-Ras activity and decreased H-Ras activity. In this model, OxPAPC increased cAMP levels, which are responsible for R-Ras activation. In turn, R-Ras activated PI3 K, which results in the activation of a5b1 integrin on the apical surface. 36 A candidate receptor that mediates this pathway is prostaglandin receptor EP2, 23 which belongs to the GPCR family. EP2 agonists increased the activation of beta 1 integrin. A line of evidence suggests lipoxygenase pathway as an alternative mechanism that regulates OxPL-induced monocyte adhesion. The treatment of ECs with a lipoxygenase inhibitor, but not cyclooxygenase, decreased MM-LDL and POVPC-induced monocyte binding to ECs. 37 Furthermore, the addition of 12(S)-hydroperoxy tetraenoic eicosatetraenoic acid reversed the inhibitory effects of a lipoxygenase inhibitor on monocyte binding. Importantly, the mechanism of OxPL-induced monocyte binding to ECs is different from that induced by other inflammatory factors, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), TNFa, or IL-1. OxPL does not upregulate intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), VCAM-1, and E-selectin expression, but it upregulates MCP1, CS1, and P-selectin, which leads to selective monocyte, but not neutrophil, adhesion to the vascular endothelium.",

            "text": "Upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. Evidence indicates that OxPL increases the expression of several chemokines, including MCP-1, IL-8, IL-6, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 a), MIP-1 b, and growth-related protein a, which are described well in previous reviews. [38] [39] [40] These cytokines play important roles in the initiation and development of chronic inflammation. IL-8 transcription induced by OxPAPC lasts at least 18 h, with the peak of mRNA expression at approximately 6 h following OxPAPC treatment. In contrast, TNFa-induced IL-8 transcription reaches its peak at 1 h and remains increased during 4 h following treatment. 41 Unlike classic inflammatory mediators such as LPS and TNFa, the induction of these inflammatory mediator genes by OxPL is achieved through different transcription mechanisms. IL-8 transcription is induced by TNFa mainly through the nuclear factor kB (NFkB) pathway. The activation of IL-8 transcription by OxPL, however, is independent of the NFkB pathway and may be mediated by various pathways that include the c-Src/JAK2/STAT3 pathway, 41 PPARg pathway, 8 eNOS/SREBP, 42 and UPR. 22, 34 Src kinases participate in growth factor/cytokine signal transduction pathways that mediate proliferation, survival, differentiation, and apoptosis. OxPAPC activates Src kinase and its downstream effector STAT3, which regulates IL-8 transcription through the binding to a gamma-interferon activation sequence element in the IL-8 promoter. 43 Moreover, the activation of Src kinase by OxPAPC is independent of cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway used by OxPAPC in activating b1 integrin for monocyte binding mentioned above. Evidence indicates that OxPAPC activates SREBP in human artificial episomal chromosome after 1 h treatment, and the activation persisted for 8 h. 31 More investigation provided evidence for the role of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in the activation of SREBP by OxPAPC. OxPAPC treatment of ECs induced a dose-and time-dependent activation of eNOS, and the NOS inhibitor N-nitro-L-argininemethyl ester significantly inhibited SREBP activation and IL-8 synthesis by OxPAPC. 42 Recent findings have shown a role for a UPR signaling cascade in Ox-PAPC-induced induction inflammatory cytokines. An immunohistochemical analysis of human atherosclerotic lesions indicated the activation of UPR in the areas that contain OxPL. 34 The small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of ATF4 and XBP1, which are the 2 branches of UPR, downregulated both the basal and the OxPAPC-stimulated expression of IL-8, IL-6, MCP-1, and CXC motif ligand 3 in the human artery ECs. 34 Inhibition of UPR by pharmacologic inhibitors or knockdown of cochaperone HTJ-1 decreased VEGF mRNA induction by OxPL. 22 The expression levels of VEGF in OxPLtreated cells strongly correlated with the induction of ATF4 target genes ATF3 and TRB3. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that OxPL stimulated the binding of ATF4 to a regulatory site in the VEGF gene.",

The anti-inflammatory effects of OxPL include (1) inhibition of ''sterile'' acute lung injury (ALI) induced by viral and bacterial derived inflammatory mediators 49,50 ; (2) inhibition of ''aseptic'' ALI induced by injurious mechanical ventilation, 51 and therefore the use of PEIPC and PECPC-like stabilized compounds may show beneficial effects in other ''aseptic'' lung injury models such as ischemia/reperfusion; (3) inhibition of lung vascular leak and inflammation in the secondary ALI induced by acute necrotizing pancreatitis 52 ; and (4) inhibition of dendritic cell maturation. 53 These anti-inflammatory effects are mediated by enhanced endothelial barrier function, induction of signaling pathways that lead to upregulation of anti-inflammatory genes, inhibition of proinflammatory gene expression, and prevention of the interaction of proinflammatory bacterial products with host cells. The signaling pathways that mediate the anti-inflammatory effects of OxPL may overlap with some signaling pathways that mediate the proinflammatory effects. In the following sections, we will discuss these OxPL functions in more detail.",

            "text": "Role of OxPL in endothelial barrier function. The vascular endothelial barrier between circulating blood and interstitial fluid is dynamically regulated by a counterbalance of barrier-protective and barrier-disruptive bioactive molecules present in the circulation. Maintaining the balance is critical for preventing the transmigration of inflammatory cells from the blood vessels to the interstitial tissue. Our previous studies have shown that the treatment of pulmonary ECs with OxPAPC (5-20 mg/ mL) enhanced the basal EC monolayer barrier properties in a dose-dependent manner, which lasted over 12 h. 10 OxPAPC pretreatment attenuated EC permeability induced by thrombin, LPS, or high-magnitude cyclic stretch, 10, 51, 54 and it accelerated the recovery of compromised EC barrier function. 10 An analysis of structurefunction relationships showed that oxidation products of arachidonic acid-, but not linoleic acid-containing phospholipids, as well as sn-2-oxygenated, but not sn-2-fragmented phospholipids, exhibited barrierprotective properties in pulmonary ECs. 10 Of note, nonoxidized phospholipids did not affect basal or agonist-induced permeability in ECs. The OxPAPC protective effects were verified in the rodent models of LPS-induced lung injury and VILI and in the model of pulmonary ECs exposed to high-magnitude cyclic stretch and thrombin stimulation. 51 Signaling mechanisms that underlie the EC barrierprotective effects of OxPAPC involve small GTPases (Rho, Rac, and Cdc42), which play pivotal roles in regulating cytoskeletal, focal adhesions, and adhesion junctions. Rac and Cdc42 signaling promotes EC barrier-protective functions. OxPAPC-induced activation of Rac and Cdc42 in pulmonary ECs leads to the enhancement of peripheral actin cytoskeleton and the formation of microspike-like actin structures at the cell-cell interface. 10 The coexpression of constitutively active Rac and Cdc42 reproduced the unique actin rearrangement observed in the OxPAPC-stimulated EC monolayer. 10 An analysis of upstream mechanisms showed the involvement of PKA, Src, and PKC activities in the OxPAPC-induced Rac/Cdc42 activities. 21, 55 The molecular mechanisms of the barrier-protective effects of PKA may be caused by its ability to attenuate the endothelial myosin light chain (MLC) kinase activity that leads to a decreased basal level of MLC phosphorylation; PAK-mediated inhibition of Rho activity; and phosphorylation of the actin-binding proteins filamin, adductin, dematin, as well as the focal adhesion proteins paxillin and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). These proteins lead to the disappearance of stress fiber and F-actin in the membrane ruffles. Our studies also indicated that OxPAPC induced the phosphorylation of cofillin, 55 which promotes peripheral actin polymerization. In addition, OxPAPC induced the phosphorylation and membrane translocation of focal adhesion protein paxillin and FAK. A recent study demonstrated a potential role of paxillin in the feedback mechanism of Rac regulation by focal adhesions in the OxPAPC-stimulated ECs. 56 The expression of paxillin with a mutated PAK1 attenuated OxPAPC-induced PAK1 activation and an EC barrier-protective response. 56 The use of an siRNA approach provided evidence that the Rac/ Cdc42-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors Tiam1 and bPIX are involved in the OxPAPC-induced Rac activation and EC barrier protection in response to OxPAPC treatment. 57 Protective effects of OxPLs against LPS-induced inflammation. LPS, which is the outer membrane component of gram-negative bacteria, is known as an endotoxin that induces a variety of proinflammatory genes leading to septic shock and death. Several studies have been performed to elucidate the molecular mechanism that underlies LPS-induced inflammation. LPS binds with the serum-binding protein called LPS binding protein and is delivered to the phosphatidylinositol glycan-linked cell surface protein CD14. The complex then interacts with TLR4 and its accessory protein MD2, and it recruits adaptor proteins MyD88 and Mal to the cytoplasmic domain of TLR4. [58] [59] [60] [61] The downstream signaling pathways of TLR4 include NF-kB, AP-1 and Egr-1 transcription factors. 62 During inflammatory insult, cells produce a plethora of ROS, which modify phospholipids peroxidatively that lead to the generation of OxPL. Thus, OxPL may represent a negative feedback mechanism that induces excessive inflammation. OxLDL and OxPL inhibit activation of NF-kB induced by LPS and CpG DNA. 49, 63 OxLDL inhibited LPS-induced IL-12 protein expression and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and activity in macrophages 64 as well as an induction of E-selectin protein expression in ECs induced by LPS. 65 Lysophosphatidylcholine inhibited the LPS induction of TF in monocytes. 66 Bochkov et al 65 revealed the mechanism of an OxPAPC inhibitory effect on LPS-induced inflammation using in vitro and in vivo models. The inhibitory effect of OxPAPC was specific for LPS but not for other inflammatory agonists such as IL-1 and TNFa; OxPAPC inhibited LPS signaling by blocking the binding of LPS to LBP and CD14. A later study by Walton et al 67 proposed an alternative mechanism via an OxPAPC-induced disruption caveolae and inhibition of the assembly of the LPS signaling complex in ECs. In addition to blocking an inflammatory signaling cascade, our studies suggested that independent of the inhibitory mechanisms mentioned above, OxPAPC may also attenuate LPS-induced and VILI via the direct enhancement of vascular endothelial barrier function. 50, 54 Anti-inflammatory mechanisms activated by OxPL. The anti-inflammatory effects of increased cAMP intracellular concentrations have been previously described. Increased cAMP levels inhibit E-selectin and VCAM-1 expression in ECs, 68 inhibit oxidative burst in neutrophils, suppress p38 MAP kinase, 69 and upregulate suppressor of cytokine signaling 3. 70 Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is an enzyme that mediates the catabolism of heme into carbon monoxide in human endothelial and smooth muscle cells. 71 The anti-inflammatory effects of HO-1 are mediated by the generation of carbon mon-oxide, which inhibits the expression of IL-1b, TNFa, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1b. 72, 73 Moreover, HO-1 induces the expression of the anti-inflammatory IL-10, which in turn upregulates the expression of HO-1. COX2 is another enzyme that is involved in OxPL-mediated anti-inflammatory signaling and the resolution of inflammation. The expression of COX-2 is induced by OxPL in a cAMP-response-element-binding-protein-dependent and PPARg-dependent manner. 74 OxPL may also activate eNOS. 42 Increased NO production has been associated with many anti-inflammatory activities including the downregulation of adhesion molecules, suppression of chemokine production, and inhibition of leukocyte extravasation. In summary, the above findings indicate that OxPL induces several anti-inflammatory signaling molecules and transcription factors and decreases the expression of inflammatory cytokines in pathologic conditions associated with acute injury or local inflammation.",

This study also suggests the involvement of OxPL in the development of ALI. OxPL increases in that study were monitored by tissue staining with a monoclonal EO6 antibody. The most potent antigens for this antibody are products of aldol condensation of fragmented products of PAPC oxidation, such as P(POVPC)VPC, diLysoPC-C9, and diOVPC, as well as Schiff bases that form covalent bonds between protein lysine residues and aldehyde groups of fragmented oxidized phospholipids such as POVPC-bovine serum albumin. 76 As discussed above, fragmented PL oxidation products induce endothelial barrier disruption (see Table I 77 ) . 10 Thus, EO6 antibodies do not discriminate between barrier-protective and barrier-disruptive OxPL. The generation of EO6-detectable OxPL in bronchioalveolar lavage and alveolar macrophages may represent the accumulation of fragmented PAPC oxidation products, aldol condensates, and Schiff bases rather than increased levels of PEIPC or PECPC. The OxPAPC doses used for intratracheal instillation (20 mg/g body weight) that affected lung elastance parameter were 5-10 times higher compared with the doses used in other studies that showed protective effects in the model of LPS-induced and CpG DNA-induced ALI. 49 It also seems that in animal models of LPS-induced lung injury and VILI, as well as lung dysfunction associated with acute necrotizing pancreatitis, higher OxPAPC doses up to 40 mg/kg may be well tolerated if administered intravenously. [49] [50] [51] [52] These doses promote vascular endothelial barrier function. In turn, the pathologic effects of high doses of intratracheal OxPAPC may be caused by the direct effects of OxPAPC on alveolar epithelial cells. Because the precise effects of OxPAPC on alveolar epithelial permeability and other physiologic responses have not been yet tested, it is possible that OxPAPC at reported doses may cause barrier-disruptive effects on epithelial cells. These possibilities need more testing.",

These important studies will improve the characterization of the composition of endogenous OxPL generated in the injured lung as well as the understanding of their role in the pathogenesis of ALI. Many published studies support the notion that cellular responses to OxPL are critically dependent on local OxPL concentrations. 10 Thus, OxPL may play a dual role in the progression of ALI. During the acute phase, a high concentration of OxPL may exert a barrier dysfunction effect, whereas decreased OxPL concentrations at the later phase of injury restore the vascular barrier and contribute to the resolution of lung inflammation and injury. Additional studies are required to test this hypothesis.",

Unlike classic inflammatory factors, OxPL triggers unique mechanisms that lead to the activation of inflammatory signaling pathways, stimulation of inflammatory transcription factors, expression of inflammatory cytokines, and generation of excessive ROS. However, OxPLs are potent inhibitors of acute inflammation mediated by the TLR family. A specific group of cyclopenthenone-containing OxPLs that include PEIPC and PECPC induces potent barrier-protective responses in the vascular ECs and inhibits hyperpermeability induced by edemagenic agonists, which are mediators of inflammation and pathologic mechanical strain. Thus, increased OxPL levels observed in the course of acute inflammation, such as bacterial infection or acute tissue injury, may represent a negative feedback mechanism that leads to the downregulation of cellular inflammatory cascades. Additional screening and characterization of OxPL compounds with barrier-protective and anti-inflammatory properties and synthesis of bioactive OxPL derivates with stabilized structure may be an exciting area of research that could potentially lead to a new group of pharmacologic molecules beneficial for the treatment of VILI, acute respiratory distress syndrome, lung inflammation, and other diseases associated with increased vascular leakage.
