By using commercial M13 phage library, single plaque isolation of 38 phages was done and binding affinities were investigated with phage-ELISA. The specificities of the selected phage clones showing high affinity to SEB were checked by using different protein molecules which can be found in food samples. Furthermore, the affinities of three selected phage clones were determined by using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors. Sequence analysis was realized for three peptides showing high binding affinity to SEB and WWRPLTPESPPA, MNLHDYHRLFWY, and QHPQINQTLYRM amino acid sequences were obtained. The peptide sequence with highest affinity to SEB was synthesized with solid phase peptide synthesis technique and thermodynamic constants of the peptide-SEB interaction were determined by using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and compared with those of antibody-SEB interaction. The binding constant of the peptide was determined as 4.2 \u00b1 0.7 \u00c2 10 5 M \u00c01 which indicates a strong binding close to that of antibody.",

SEB, produced by Staphylococcus aureus, is a pyrogenic toxin responsible for staphylococcal food poisoning in humans and has been an attractive choice of biological aerosol weapon due to its inherent stability and high intoxication effect [15] . Numerous immunological techniques have been applied to the detection of SEB such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELI-SA) [16] . Because the traditional immunological methods are in most cases time-consuming and inconvenient, many novel and rapid immunosensors have been developed for the detection of SEB based on piezoelectric crystal sensors [17, 18] , surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors [19] [20] [21] , and fiber optic sensors [22] . 0006-291X/$ -see front matter \u00d3",

SEB, produced by Staphylococcus aureus, is a pyrogenic toxin responsible for staphylococcal food poisoning in humans and has been an attractive choice of biological aerosol weapon due to its inherent stability and high intoxication effect [15] . Numerous immunological techniques have been applied to the detection of SEB such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELI-SA) [16] . Because the traditional immunological methods are in most cases time-consuming and inconvenient, many novel and rapid immunosensors have been developed for the detection of SEB based on piezoelectric crystal sensors [17, 18] , surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors [19] [20] [21] , and fiber optic sensors [22] . In this study, SEB active peptide sequences were determined using phage display technique. Different from the common approach, not only the affinities of selected phage clones towards SEB molecule were investigated but also the interactions of clones with other molecules which can be found in real food samples were determined by phage-ELISA. The affinities of selected phage clones to SEB were also visualized using surface plasmon resonance system. After determining the amino acid sequences of selected peptides, the peptide with highest affinity was synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis and the interaction of peptide with SEB molecule was studied by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The binding constant (k) and thermodynamic binding parameters (DH, DG) were determined for the interactions of peptide-SEB and antibody-SEB.",

The nucleotide sequences and corresponding amino acid sequences of those phage clones were reported in Table 1 . The random regions of SEB-binding phage clones do not share any consensus sequence. This indicates that SEB-binding phage clones show affinity to different epitopes of the SEB molecule. While phage clone 9 is rich in glutamine, phage clone 6 is rich in proline.",

Raw ITC profiles obtained by the titration of peptide to the SEB solution and the corrected injection heats are shown in Fig. 4 . The interaction between peptide-SEB was exothermic with a binding constant (k) of 4.2 \u00b1 0.7 \u00c2 10 5 M \u00c01 . An enthalpy change (DH) of -32.0 \u00b1 2.0 kJ mol \u00c01 and free energy change (DG) of \u00c032.12 kJ mol -1 was obtained from the ITC data. The interaction between antibody-SEB was also exothermic with a higher binding constant (k = 1.6 \u00b1 0.8 \u00c2 10 7 M \u00c01 ). The DH and DG values for antibody-SEB interaction were \u00c0369 \u00b1 29 kJ mol \u00c01 and \u00c041.06 kJ mol \u00c01 , respectively. The interactions were accompanied by a large change in enthalpy and a large negative value in DG represents a high affinity [25] . Although the binding constant of the peptide is lower than that of the antibody, it still indicates a strong binding to SEB molecule.",

As the result of crossspecificity test, although there were significant amount of phages clones bound non-specifically to the other protein molecules, the selected phage clones showed higher affinity to SEB than the others. The non-specific binding of phage clones may be due to the hydrophobic regions in the phage coat protein. The SPR sensorgrams show that, phage 24 and phage 9 bind to SEB with a strong affinity. After DNA sequencing, the peptide of the phage clone with highest affinity was synthesized and the binding constant of peptide to SEB was determined by ITC. The results indicate that the selected peptides can be used as recognizing agents in biosensors. In addition to their high affinity, the small size they have, will be an important advantage in enhancing the sensitivity of biosensors like SPR. In further studies, the selected peptides will be combined with SPR sensors allowing the detection of SEB with a sensitivity comparing favorably to that of immunosensors. ",
