Jassal et al, manuscript submitted). With continued aging of the dialysis population, we believe an even larger number of dialysis patients will require long-term nursing care, whereas many others will need social support services to continue to live at home.",

[13] [14] [15] Cardiac rehabilitation in dialysis pa-tients is associated with a 35% decreased risk of cardiac mortality 16 ; however, few data are available showing the outcome with geriatric rehabilitation services. Studies of geriatric rehabilitation in dialysis patients are limited to a few case reports or retrospective studies with small sample sizes ranging from 3 to 40 subjects. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] Assuming studies from the nondialysis literature 24, 25 are applicable to the dialysis population, one would predict that geriatric rehabilitation could limit functional impairment, prolong personal independence, and decrease the need for nursing home care in dialysis patients.",

Most commonly, patients remained in the acute-care hospital ward and therapists would come and deliver therapy for short periods on the acute-ward floor. Therapy sessions occurred on average 2 to 5 times a week, but ranged in duration from 15 to 40 minutes according to the acute-care workload. Less commonly, patients were transferred to specialized rehabilitation units where they would receive formal therapy sessions in an environment promoting independence. Patients would be temporarily discharged to attend their 3-times-weekly dialysis treatment at offsite dialysis units. It appeared that in many cases, the need to make acute-care beds available and the perception that dialysis patients did poorly with rehabilitation meant that patients often were not given sufficient opportunities for rehabilitation before being advised to seek nursing home placement.",

Shortened or cancelled therapy sessions because therapists viewed patients as too unwell; patients reported dyspnea before dialysis or fatigue after dialysis; patients were anxious, particularly about not missing their dialysis session; and too-early or toolate transportation. 5. Lack of integration of treatment goals for acute medical care and rehabilitation therapy. When patients remained in acute care for ongoing rehabilitation therapy, the focus of the main health care team was acute medical management, and when patients were transferred to rehabilitation units, the main focus was rehabilitation care with little attention given to ongoing medical issues. 6. Limited interdisciplinary communication about acute medical problems that interfered with the ability to participate in rehabilitation therapy; for example, pain management in the face of renal failure, edema resulting in decreased ankle mobility, dyspnea with exertion, orthostasis, and effects of sedative medications.",

Our data suggest that geriatric rehabilitation is feasible for older hemodialysis patients after acute care hospitalization or acute loss of function, and a substantial proportion of patients can return to their homes. Based on the impressions of the authors (S.V.J., R.L.), providing dialysis in short daily sessions and integrating care in a multidisciplinary team were key ingredients for success of the program. Whereas short daily dialysis was designed primarily to increase rehabilitation efficiency by limiting scheduling conflicts and interference between medical and rehabilitation treatments, 17 we heard from patients that they preferred daily dialysis and reported higher energy levels. We believe short daily dialysis may have been less exhausting for patients, allowed more dietary flexibility, and improved fluid and electrolyte control. In addition, patients seemed less anxious about their dialysis schedule and overall were very willing to participate in rehabilitation treatments. We also noted increased collaboration between caregivers over time, with detailed discussion of the goals, achievements, and challenges for each patient in the weekly team meetings. We noted reciprocal continued medical education between staff of different disciplines and close collaboration between the various health professions involved in dialysis and rehabilitation care.",

Comparisons with previously published studies are limited because most studies were small, involved younger dialysis patients, and omitted clinical details about concurrent comorbid illnesses, diabetes status, and so on. [17] [18] [19] 22, 23 Only 1 study involved dialysis patients with an average age older than 70 years. 20 In that study, 80% of patients did poorly with rehabilitation. In other studies, dialysis patients were often 10 to 15 years younger and were admitted after acute surgical procedures. The largest of these, by Forrest et al, 17 reported outcomes for 40 dialysis patients. In their study, only 8 of 40 patients were reported as \"medically complicated.\" Average LOS was 12 days, substantially shorter than the LOS in our population (average LOS, 48 days). Age, patient comorbidity, and differences in health care systems may explain these discrepancies. In Canada, health care is provincially funded and therefore accessible to all regardless of health insurance coverage. Therefore, we believe a more appropriate comparison group may be nondialysis patients admitted to a geriatric facility within Canada. One such study is by Patrick et al. 36 In that study, non-dialysis-dependent geriatric patients admitted for rehabilitation after an acute hospitalization had similar overall improvements in raw FIM scores from the time of admission to discharge.

Furthermore, the discharge destination may be influenced by many factors, including social and financial resources.
