There is also information about diseases of commercial rabbits, which are mainly investigated by post-mortem examination. In contrast, there is a dearth of literature about the effects of clinical diseases on the blood picture of rabbits or the use of blood tests as diagnostic or prognostic indicators. It is not always possible to extrapolate from other species, especially carnivores such as dogs and cats to the herbivorous rabbit with its specialized physiology. At the present time, much of the information that is available on the haematology and biochemistry of pet rabbits is anecdotal, although it can be helpful and is better than no information at all.",

Some parameters such as bile acids, cholesterol and urea follow a diurnal rhythm that also affects the total and differential white cell count (Fox and Laird, 1970; Fekete, 1989; Loeb and Quimby, 1989) . Stress associated with car journeys or a period in unfamiliar surroundings will increase blood glucose and alter haematological parameters such as the distribution of neutrophils and lymphocytes. Pregnancy affects parameters such as protein, haematocrit, cholesterol, alkaline phosphatase, triglycerides (Viard-Drouet et al., 1984) , glucose, sodium, calcium, phosphate and red cell indices (Palm, 1997) . Serum cholesterol is the parameter that is most affected and can be up to 30% lower in pregnant than in nonpregnant animals (Palm, 1997) .",

Some reference ranges are an amalgamation of other references ranges and result in a range so wide that almost any result will fall within it. For example, the reference range for serum albumin concentra-tions of pet rabbits is given as 27-46 g/l (Malley, 1996) based on four published sets of data. Gillett (1994) gives an even wider range of 27-50 g/l for laboratory rabbits based on five sets of data. For some parameters there are big differences between published reference ranges. An example is blood calcium. Gillett (1994) gives a range of 1.5-3.4 mmol/l in comparison with 3.4-4.0 mmol/l by Harkness and Wagner (1995) . Differences in calcium content of the diet between the groups of rabbits or differences in analytical technique could explain these discrepancies. Different laboratory methods can result in large differences between reference ranges. An example is alkaline phosphatase. Collins (1988) gives a reference range of 4.1-16.2 IU/l in comparison with 10-70 IU/l (Gillett, 1994) or 112-350 IU/l (Harkness and Wagner, 1995) .",

The red blood cells vary in diameter within a range of 5.0-7.8 \u00b5m (Sanderson and Philips, 1981) . This variation in diameter (anisocytosis) is a feature of blood smears from rabbits and is not a significant finding (see Plate 2). The red cell distribution width (RDW) is a measurement of the variation in size of erythrocytes and is higher in rabbits (11-15, Idexx reference range) than in dogs and cats (8-10; Bush, 1981) . In dogs and cats, anisocytosis is indicative of the presence of reticulocytes and a regenerative anaemia. In rabbits, 1-4% of circulating erythrocytes may be reticulotytes. Polychromasia and reticulocytes in rabbit blood smears have been attributed to the short life span and high turnover of erythrocytes (Kraus et al., 1984) . Nucleated red cells and Howell-Jolly bodies can also be found occasionally (McLaughlin and Fish, 1994) . Rabbit neutrophils have an almost colourless cytoplasm and contain two types of granules. The smaller granules stain pink giving a pinkish colour to the cytoplasm. Larger granules stain a deeper pinkish-red. The overall colour of the neutrophils varies according to the proportion of large and small granules. The granular appearance of the cytoplasm has led to different nomenclature. Rabbit neutrophils may be called heterophils, pseudoeosinophils, acidophils or amphophils depending on the text (Sanderson and Philips, 1981; Benson and Paul-Murphy, 1999) . Neutrophils measure 10-15 \u00b5m in comparison with eosinophils that measure 12-16 \u00b5m (Sanderson and Phillips, 1981) .",

Values greater than 45% are indicative of dehydration, especially in rabbits suffering from gut motility problems. Values of less than 30% indicate anaemia that can be classi-fied into non-regenerative and regenerative in a similar manner to other species. A regenerative anaemia is associated with chronic blood loss, e.g. due to heavy flea infestation or from a site that intermittently bleeds such as a uterine endometrial aneurysm. Uterine adenocarcinomas are a common finding in middle-aged does. Lead poisoning can result in a regenerative anaemia with the presence of nucleated erythrocytes, hypochromasia, poikilocytosis and cytoplasmic basophilic stippling (Fudge, 2000) . A nonregenerative anaemia is caused by diseases such as lymphoma or chronic renal failure. Autoimmune haemolytic disease has not been described as a clinical phenomenon in pet rabbits although there are reports that it occurs. Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia has been reported in laboratory rabbits in association with lymphosarcoma (Weisbroth, 1994) . Chronic debilitating disease such as dental disorders or abscesses often cause a mild anaemia in pet rabbits (Harcourt-Brown and Baker, 2001 ) (see Figure 6 .1).",

Rabbits are particularly susceptible to the effects of stress. A car journey to the surgery, a period in the waiting room next to a barking dog or the excitement of handling can be reflected in the blood picture. Adrenaline and cortisol affect the distribution of lymphocytes throughout the body. Administration of exogenous adrenaline to rabbits results in redistribution of lymphocytes from spleen and bone marrow to peripheral blood, lungs and liver (Toft et al., 1992a) . Conversely, exogenous corticosteroid administration results in a redistribution of lymphocytes from the peripheral blood, bone marrow and spleen to the lymphatic tissue in rabbits (Toft et al., 1992b) . Prolonged periods of stress cause neutrophilia and lymphopaenia. Marked changes in white cell distribution with a relative neutrophilia and lymphopaenia were found in a study of the cortisol levels and haemograms of rabbits after transport, either by air or by lorry. The changes in white cell distribution lasted for 24-48 h and were correlated with increased cortisol levels (Toth and January, 1990) .",

Carnivores eat periodically and have sudden large intakes of nutrients that must be stored for utilization during the fast between meals. Herbivores graze for long periods of the day and are continually absorbing nutrients from the digestive tract. In rabbits, volatile fatty acids are produced from bacterial fermentation in the caecum and are continually absorbed as an energy source. A fasting sample is difficult to obtain from a rabbit. Withholding food does not prevent caecotrophy and the digestion of caecotrophs provides a source of glucose. Blood samples taken after 96 h of food deprivation may show no alteration in blood glucose levels (Kozma et al., 1974) . Hyperglycaemia is a relatively common finding in rabbits and can be accompanied by glycosuria. Handling alone can cause an increase in blood glucose to the order of 8.5 mmol/l experimentally (Knudtzon, 1988) and 15 mmol/l or more anecdotally. Diabetes mellitus has not been described in pet rabbits and there is some difference of opinion about its importance as a clinical disease (Hoefer, 2000; Jenkins, 2000; Rosenthal, 2000) . Herbivorous animals withstand the absence of insulin more readily than carnivorous ones (Bentley, 1998) and are therefore not so susceptible to diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus has been induced in laboratory rabbits by the administration of alloxan.

They were also significantly higher than rabbits kept in hutches that were not suffering from dental problems (see Figure 6 .1). The difference in albumin levels was attributed to differences in diet and husbandry. Caecotrophs are a source of amino acids for rabbits and normal caecotrophy is an important element of their protein metabolism. Low fibre diets, obesity, dental disease or skeletal abnormalities can prevent rabbits ingesting caecotrophs from the anus and reduce the available amino acids for protein synthesis. Rabbits that are kept in hutches are more likely to be eating a low fibre diet and to suffer from obesity and skeletal problems than rabbits living outside with unrestricted access to natural vegetation and exercise.",

The rabbit's urea metabolism is further complicated by urea utilization by caecal microflora during catabolism or during periods of dietary excess. Therefore small fluctuations in serum urea concentrations are difficult to interpret. Laboratory reference ranges apply to animals that are fed a standard diet and have usually been bled at a specific time of day. Pet rabbits are subject to greater fluctuations in blood urea values due to the variation in diet and other factors, and can have values slightly higher than laboratory reference ranges. Prerenal azotaemia associated with poor renal perfusion occurs during periods of dehydration. The rabbit has a limited capacity to concentrate urea and a greater volume of urine is required when urea load increases (Brewer and Cruise, 1994) . Increased blood urea values were recorded in a study by Licois et al. (1978) of young rabbits with diarrhoea experimentally induced with coccidiosis. The authors suggested that the blood urea values rose as a result of intense nitrogen catabolism during weight loss associated with the disease. Water deprivation can lead to high blood urea values as high as 40 mmol/l in association with creatinine values in excess of 200 \u00b5mol/l (Harcourt-Brown, unpublished data).

Urinary pH is approximately 8-8.2. Rabbit urine is normally turbid due to the presence of calcium carbonate that can be seen as sediment in collected samples. The urine from anorexic, pregnant, lactating or young rabbits is often clear. The colour of normal urine can vary from pale yellow, to orange, brown or red, mimicking haematuria. Plant porphyrin pigments are the cause of red coloured urine and can be distinguished from haematuria with urinanalysis dipstick tests. Alternatively, a Wood's lamp can be used, as urinary pigments fluoresce when exposed to ultraviolet light (Benson and Paul-Murphy, 1999) . In addition to the presence of calcium carbonate crystals, oxalate or ammonium magnesium phosphate crystals can also be found in normal rabbit urine. The specific gravity of rabbit urine is difficult to evaluate accurately due to the presence of mineral deposits but is approximately 1.003-1.036. Traces of glucose and protein can be present in normal rabbit urine. As in other species, rabbit urine can be spun and the sediment examined microscopically for the presence of crystals, red cells, inflammatory cells and bacteria. Cultures can be taken to confirm bacterial infection and aid antibiotic selection. Examination of urine sediment stained with gram stain can reveal Encephalitozoon cuniculi spores that are oval, strongly gram-positive with a coiled filament inside (Pye and Cox, 1977; Patton, 2000) .

            "text": "Rabbits produce two types of faeces: hard dry pellets that are composed of compressed indigestible fibre and soft caecotrophs that are composed of a smooth paste rich in bacteria and other microorganisms. The first step in faeces examination is to determine which type of faeces has been collected. It is often samples of soft faeces or caecotrophs that are collected for examination because their consistency is abnormally loose or the owner has mistaken uningested caecotrophs for diarrhoea. Microscopically the two types of faeces are completely different. Hard faeces contain indigestible fragments of plant debris and little else. Caecotrophic material contains a wide range of microorganisms including large gram-negative bacilli, Bacteroides, large metachromic staining bacilli and many other bacteria including oval and fusiform rods. In some types of diarrhoea, a mixture of indigestible fragments of plant material can be seen alongside a range of typical caecal microorganisms. This signifies a failure of the proximal colon to separate the indigestible and digestible fractions of the diet. Coccidial oocysts or eggs of the non-pathogenic oxyurid Passalurus ambiguus can be found in both hard and soft faeces of infected rabbits. Coccidial oocysts can be confused with a nonpathogenic Saccharomyces, a budding sporogenous yeast that can be present in large numbers in rabbit faeces (see Figure 6 .2). Clostridium spiroforme is a large grampositive, semicircular or spiral-shaped bacterium that may be seen in faecal smears from diarrhoeic rabbits or those that have died from enterotoxaemia. Centrifuging faecal material at 20 000 rpm for 15 minutes and gram staining the residue after the supernatant has been removed improves the chance of diagnosis (Langan and O'Rourke Schaeffer, 2000) . Although the presence of semicircular bacteria in the faeces or caecal material is suggestive of clostridial enterotoxaemia, it is not a reliable diagnostic criterion. Clostridia species can be present in the normal caecal flora and proliferate after death. The demonstration of the toxin and anaerobic culture of the organism is required for positive diagnosis (Carman and Borriello, 1983) .",

Shows large numbers of coccidial oocysts interspersed with Saccharomyces guttulatus. The faecal sample was from a 14-week-old, thin rabbit that was suffering from diarrhoea. Faecal material was emulsified with water before being passed through a fine sieve to remove the coarse debris. The homogenate was then centrifuged and the supernatent discarded. The residue was mixed with saturated salt solution and centrifuged again. After the sample had been spun, more saturated salt solution was added to the test tube until a meniscus formed. A cover slip was placed over the meniscus and the sample left for approximately 30 minutes for the oocysts or worm eggs to float to the top of the tube. At the end of this period, the cover slip and surface film was removed from the test tube, placed on a microscope slide and examined under low power.",
