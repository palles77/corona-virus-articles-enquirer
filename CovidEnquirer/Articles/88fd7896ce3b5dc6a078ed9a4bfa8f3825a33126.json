The SARS epidemic has affected nearly 8588 people and killed 724 worldwide. Hong Kong people were afraid of venturing out to crowded public areas and shopping malls, causing a significant drop in business for restaurants. By any measure, business levels were a far shot away from the levels prior to SARS.

All rights reserved. doi:10. 1016/j.ijhm.2004.12.001 platters of food in a crowded environment were the worst affected having lost as much as 90% of their business since the outbreak began (Geoffrey and Prystay, 2003) . This reveals vulnerability in the catering industry's ability to respond to crisis, especially epidemics like SARS that spread panic and disrupt the everyday activities of the people. However, some restaurants have managed to stay afloat, with some even turning a little profit. By studying the crisis response of these restaurants, we can formulate a crisis response and recovery plan to serve as a future reference for other restaurants facing similar disasters.",

Pauchant and Mitroff (1992) regard a crisis as a disruption that physically affects a system as a whole and threatens its basic assumptions, its subjective sense of self, and its existential core. Barton (1993) suggests a crisis is a major, unpredictable event that has potentially negative results. In the business context, an event that damages a firm's reputation or drastically harms the long-term goals of profitability, growth or survival is called a crisis (Lerbinger, 1997) .",

Capitalizing on the people's current emphasis on health and strengthening their own immunity, some restaurants offered specialized ''anti-SARS'' menus, with items that claim to boost customers' immune system. Such items are often based on Chinese herbal medicine and aim to induce harmony between the yin and yang forces within the body. This approach was well received by the Hong Kong people, who already have a strong tradition of incorporating Chinese medical herbs into their diet. For customers who were nonetheless still afraid of dining out, many restaurants provided take-away or delivery services.",

The literature on crisis management has stressed the importance of a plan for crisis management (see, for example, Fearn-Banks, 1996; Coombs, 1999; Barton, 2001) . To survive a crisis, a restaurant must have formal guidelines and procedures for communicating to employees, as well as the general public about various reactive measures a restaurant plans to undertake in the event of a crisis. A restaurant's contingency plan should not cover epidemics like SARS only, but should also look into recovery measures for all the other six types of crises we described in Table 1 . In formulating a crisis management plan, a restaurant must look at its needs and goals, establish a risk management policy and communicate it to all staff. The crisis management plan should establish clear accountabilities and responsibilities for identifying, managing and monitoring risks. In the planning process, restaurant managers must trade-off the risk involved and the costs of the measures to be undertaken, and should encourage openness and participation from all staff. Finally, the plan should also incorporate a review process to enable a restaurant to learn from each crisis for more effective crisis management in future.",
