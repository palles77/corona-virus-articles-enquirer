Moreover, the pathological features of COVID-19 pneumonia greatly resemble those seen in SARS and MERS, and show diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates, desquamation of pneumocytes and hyaline membrane formation, indicating acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) [6] .",

Corticosteroid are the classical immunosuppressive drugs, which are important to stop or delay the progression of the pneumonia and have been proved to be effective for treatment of ARDS [14, 15] . In addition to immunosuppressive activities, corticosteroid have an anti-inflammatory role to reduce systemic inflammatory, decrease exudative fluid in the lung tissue, promote absorption of inflammasome and prevent further diffuse alveolar damage, which can relieve hypoxemia and effectively protect the lung to prevent further progression of respiratory insufficiency [16] .",
