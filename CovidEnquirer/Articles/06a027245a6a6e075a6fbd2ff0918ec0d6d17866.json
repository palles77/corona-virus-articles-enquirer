            "text": "U pper respiratory tract illness (URI) is the most common infectious disease of childhood and one of the most frequent reasons that parents seek medical care. 1 The first characterization of URI symptoms using modern virologic techniques was in the 1960s in young adults. 2 The frequency of URI in children and the nature and duration of respiratory symptoms has received increasing attention in the current era of molecular virology. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Historically, children have been reported to experience an average of 6-8 acute respiratory illnesses per year. 16 However, the number of URIs and the particular viruses involved vary with age, season, geography, and attendance at out-of-home childcare. Previous studies have evaluated URIs in: (1) birth cohorts of children at high risk for atopy 11, 12, 17, 18 ; or (2) cross-sectional studies during a single respiratory season. 4, 5, 7, 15, 17 Only a few studies have prospectively followed substantial numbers of young children longitudinally, both when well and during symptomatic URI. [18] [19] [20] Although the frequency of acute otitis media as a complication of viral URI has been reported, there has been relatively little systematic investigation of the rate of sinusitis as a complication of URI. The single recent study investigating this question was performed in children 6-36 months of age. 9 In this age group, acute otitis media is a frequent early complication of URI (30%-37%) that leads to antimicrobial treatment that, in turn, may prevent the subsequent development of acute bacterial sinusitis. 9, 19 To determine the rate of sinusitis complicating Merck Inc, Medimmune, Boehringer Ingelheim, Gilead, and Genentech.

Families of eligible children received information about the study by mail approximately 2 weeks before their next scheduled wellchild visit. Parental interest in the study was queried by the office nurse. If interest was expressed, the study coordinator provided additional information and invited the parent to participate in the study. Children were excluded from the study if they had an underlying condition reported by the parent or noted in the medical record, likely to alter the natural history of URI, including congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, craniofacial abnormalities, cystic fibrosis, allergic rhinitis, or a previous episode of chronic sinusitis. Written, informed consent was obtained and assent also was obtained from older children ($7 years of age). Subjects received a small stipend for participation. The study was approved by the University of Wisconsin Institutional Review Board. Demographic information was obtained by the study nurse. Responses to race/ethnicity questions were self-reported by the subject's parent. Nasal samples were obtained at entry and during 4 surveillance visits (February, April, September, and December) when children were asymptomatic as verified by the study nurses. Parents were instructed to call the study nurse at the first sign of a URI, which was defined as at least 48 hours of respiratory symptoms including nasal congestion, nasal discharge, or cough. Nasal samples were obtained on day 3-4 of illness by the study nurse, and a recovery sample was obtained on day 15. A clinical assessment at the time of the visit assured that symptoms reflected illness confined to the upper respiratory tract. A symptom survey was filled out on day 3-4 and subsequently by telephone on days 7, 10, and 15. 21 The survey inquired about fever, nasal symptoms, cough, headache, irritability, facial pain, facial swelling, activity, sleep, and impaired appetite. If a symptom was present initially, a score of 2 was assigned. If it was absent the score was 0. If a symptom became more severe, less severe, or stayed the same, +1, \u00c01 or 0, respectively, was added to the previous score for each symptom. The URI was considered resolved if the score was #2. In addition, parents were asked to record any missed days of childcare, school, or work because of respiratory illness in their child on a calendar provided for that purpose.",

This age group was specifically chosen to determine the rate of sinusitis complicating URI because the frequency of URI is high and the risk of acute otitis media is considerably lower than during the first 3 years of life. Using these methods, viruses were identified in 81% of symptomatic URIs. RV infections were most common, and there was evidence of differential virulence among viruses, even between RV species.

            "text": "URIs resulted in frequent medically attended visits for substantial rates of secondary infection as well as time lost from work or childcare. We determined sinusitis to be the most common complication of URI in this age group. Our estimated rate of sinusitis is similar to other studies examining sinusitis as a complication of URI in different populations of children. Wald et al 25 examined 0-to 3-year-old children attending childcare and determined the rate of sinusitis following URI to be 6.5%-13%. Marom et al 9 reported a rate of 8% in a population of 6-to 35-month-old children who were followed prospectively. In both of these studies, the rate of sinusitis that was reported may have been blunted by the frequency of acute otitis media that is usually managed with antibiotics, which may have prevented the development of sinusitis. Ueda et al, 26 basing the diagnosis of sinusitis on radiographic findings, found the rate of sinusitis to be 6.7% in 2-to 15-year-olds with URI symptoms. Two other observational studies of children with URI found rates of 8.3%-17.3% in children presenting to clinic with respiratory symptoms. 27, 28 Our study determined the mean number of URIs per child per year. Although there was variation in our data with children acquiring from 0-9 URIs per year, the average of 1.3 was lower than expected. A classic study done in the 1950s, the Cleveland Illness in the Home study, found a rate of 6-7 \"common respiratory diseases\" per child per year in this age group. 16 This difference may be explained by changes in societal structure as reflected by an increase in childcare attendance by very young children. Early communal experiences may result in children developing more illnesses earlier in life and fewer illnesses in later years. Three other recent studies provide contradictory results. Revai et al 29 and Byington et al 20 found a rate of approximately 0.5 illnesses per month in children less than five years of age. These children were followed in a similar fashion to children in our investigation but were younger. In a household surveillance study, Monto et al 8 reported a rate of 0.6 URIs per respiratory season in children 5-17 years old. Although children in the Monto study were only followed during the respiratory virus season, it is safe to say that children had fewer than 1 acute respiratory illness per year. These differences almost certainly relate to variation by age group, season, and geography. Viruses were detected in 81% of episodes of symptomatic URI; RV was detected most often, followed in frequency by CoV and FLU. Viruses, particularly RVs, were also detected frequently at asymptomatic surveillance visits, which have been reported previously. 13, 14, 20, [30] [31] [32] [33] Our results show that there are differences in clinical symptoms according to the viral cause of URI. For example, as is well known, fever was seen more often in association with FLU and less often with RV illnesses. In addition, the probability of symptomatic illness was related to RV species. The risk of URI was greatest with RV-C and then RV-A, but RV-B was not significantly associated with illness, which is in agreement with previous findings in infants. 11 RVs were most prevalent in the spring and fall but were detected continuously throughout the year, whereas most other viruses had a more seasonal pattern.",
