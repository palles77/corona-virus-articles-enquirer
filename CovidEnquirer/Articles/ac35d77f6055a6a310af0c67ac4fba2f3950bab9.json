There is a complex functional interplay among hematopoietic cells with the supporting connective tissue cells, extracellular matrix, and soluble factors, which form the hematopoietic microenvironment. Behavior of hematopoietic cells is influenced by direct cell-to-cell and cellmatrix interactions and by soluble mediators, such as cytokines and hormones that interact with cells and with matrix proteins. Cells localize to specific niches within the hematopoietic microenvironment via adhesion molecules, such as integrins, immunoglobulins, lectins, and other receptors, which recognize ligands on other cells or matrix components. Cells also express receptors for soluble molecules such as chemokines (chemoattractant cytokines) and hormones that influence cell trafficking and metabolism. Iron is essential to hemoglobin synthesis and function. It is acquired through the diet and is transported to the bone marrow via the iron transport protein, transferrin. Central macrophages either store iron as ferritin or hemosiderin, or transfer the iron to erythroid precursors for hemoglobin synthesis. Hemosiderin is identifiable in routinely stained marrow preparations as an intracellular brown pigment. However, Perls's Prussian blue stain is more sensitive and specific for iron detection.",

The central macrophage, also known as a nurse cell, anchors the precursors within the island niche, regulates erythroid proliferation and differentiation, transfers iron to the erythroid progenitors for hemoglobin synthesis, and phagocytizes extruded metarubricyte nuclei. Although erythroblastic islands occur throughout the marrow, those with more differentiated erythroid cells neighbor sinusoids, whereas nonadjacent islands contain mostly undifferentiated precursors. As erythroid cells mature from a rubriblast to a mature erythrocyte, their nuclei become smaller and more condensed. The nucleus is eventually extruded to form a polychromatophil. Erythroid cells also become less basophilic and more eosinophilic as more hemoglobin is produced and as RNA-rich organelles are lost during maturation. (Hemoglobin stains eosinophilic, and RNA stains basophilic with routine Romanowsky's stains.) As granulocytes (e.g., neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils) mature from a myeloblast to their mature forms, their nuclei become dense and segmented. Granulocytes acquire their secondary or specific granules during the myelocyte stage and can be morphologically differentiated starting at this stage. Neutrophils have neutral-staining secondary granules, eosinophil secondary granules have an affinity for acidic or eosin dyes, and basophil secondary granules have an affinity for basic dyes. Monoblasts differentiate into promonocytes with ruffled nuclear boarders and then into monocytes. In most mammals, mature erythrocytes have a biconcave disk shape, called a discocyte. Microscopically, these cells are round and eosinophilic with a central area of pallor. However, the central concavity may not be microscopically apparent in species other than the dog. Camelids normally have oval erythrocytes, termed ovalocytes or elliptocytes, which facilitate better gas exchange at high altitudes. The erythrocytes of some animals are prone to in vitro shape change, including those of cervids, pigs, and some goat breeds (e.g., Angora).",

When erythrocytes reach the end of their life span, they are destroyed in a process termed hemolysis. Hemolysis may occur within blood vessels (intravascular hemolysis) or by sinusoidal macrophages (extravascular hemolysis). During intravascular hemolysis, erythrocytes release their contents, mostly hemoglobin, directly into blood. However, during extravascular hemolysis, macrophages phagocytize entire erythrocytes, leaving little or no hemoglobin in the blood. Normal turnover of erythrocytes occurs mainly by extravascular hemolysis within the spleen, and to a lesser extent in other organs such as the liver and bone marrow.

These remaining organelles impart a bluish-purple cast (polychromasia) to reticulocytes on routine blood smear examination. The resultant cells are termed polychromatophils. Because older reticulocytes do not exhibit polychromasia, more sensitive laboratory techniques must be used for accurate reticulocyte quantification.

Bilirubin is then exported into circulation, where it is transported to the liver by albumin. The liver conjugates and subsequently excretes bilirubin into bile for elimination from the body. Intravascular hemolysis normally occurs at only extremely low levels. Hemoglobin is a tetramer that, when released from the erythrocyte into the blood, splits into dimers that bind to a plasma protein called haptoglobin. The hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex is taken up by hepatocytes and macrophages. This is the major pathway for handling free hemoglobin. However, free hemoglobin may also oxidize to form methemoglobin, which dissociates to form metheme and globin. Metheme binds to a plasma protein called hemopexin, which is taken up by hepatocytes and macrophages in a similar manner to hemoglobin-haptoglobin complexes. Free heme in the reduced form binds to albumin, from which it is taken up in the liver and converted into bilirubin.",

Hematopoietic cells' response to injury is dependent upon whether the insult is on the marrow or within extramarrow tissues. In general, marrow-directed injury or disturbances result in production of abnormal hematopoietic cells (dysplasia), fewer hematopoietic cells (hypoplasia), or a failure of hematopoietic cell development (aplasia). Dysplasia, hypoplasia, and aplasia may be specific for one cell line, such as pure red cell aplasia, or affect multiple lineages, as seen with aplastic anemia. Accordingly, decreased blood concentrations of the involved cell types are expected with hypoplasia or aplasia. Erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic hypoplasia or aplasia causes nonregenerative anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, respectively. Bicytopenia is used to describe decreased blood concentrations of two cell lines, whereas pancytopenia indicates decreased blood concentrations of all three cell types. Bicytopenia or pancytopenia may indicate generalized marrow disease, such as occurs with aplastic anemia or marrow malignancies (leukemia), necrosis, fibrosis (myelofibrosis), or inflammation (myelitis).

However, antemortem blood analyses are not always available, and interpretation of hematopoietic cytomorphologic examination results becomes difficult to impossible shortly after death. Postmortem bone marrow should be collected as soon as possible after death or euthanasia, preferably within 30 minutes. Samples may be collected from the proximal femur, rib, sternum or vertebrae. When collecting from the femur, the femoral neck is removed with a bone saw, or a fragment of the shaft is removed with bone-cutting shears. Cytologic samples are first collected using the paintbrush technique: gently sample the red marrow with a clean, dry, naturalbristle brush, and then carefully brush the material onto a clean glass microscope slide in two to four parallel wavy lines. The brush should be cleaned and dried before its use on a different animal. The slide is then air dried, stored away from formalin fumes, and then stained with a routine (Romanowsky) stain. For histologic evaluation the entire femoral head or femoral shaft or rib fragment with exposed red marrow is submersed in 10% neutral buffered formalin.

In veterinary medicine there has been a great deal of work on specific mechanisms of hypocoagulability, whereas mechanisms of hypercoagulability are less fully characterized. Disorders of primary hemostasis typically result in \"small bleeds\" (e.g., petechiation, mild ecchymosis, bleeding from mucous membranes, bleeding immediately after venipuncture), whereas disorders of secondary hemostasis typically result in \"big bleeds\" (e.g., hemorrhage into body cavities/ joints, marked ecchymosis, large hematomas, delayed bleeding after venipuncture). This chapter concentrates on primary disorders of hemostasis and also covers disseminated intravascular coagulation, which is the secondary condition. However, it is important to note that coagulation disorders can also result from other underlying disease processes. For example, advanced liver disease can lead to abnormal hemostasis through decreased or defective synthesis of coagulation factors or impaired clearance of fibrinolytic products that inhibit coagulation reactions and platelet function. Vascular disorders may also result in a bleeding tendency because of abnormalities of endothelial function or collagen-platelet interactions. Specific diseases involving abnormal structure or function of hematopoietic or hemostatic elements are discussed later in this chapter.",

In particular, stimulated megakaryocytes and macrophages produce fibrogenic cytokines, including plateletderived growth factor, transforming growth factor-\u03b2, and epidermal growth factor.

The inflammation is evident as fibrin deposition, edema, and multifocal neutrophilic infiltrates; immune-mediated cytopenias may also concurrently occur with bone marrow lymphocytic and/or plasma cell hyperplasia.",

Hemolysis is not apparent until the concentration of extracellular hemoglobin is greater than approximately 50 mg/dL. Cell-free hemoglobin is scavenged by haptoglobin until haptoglobin becomes saturated with hemoglobin at a concentration of approximately 150 mg/dL. When haptoglobin is saturated, any remaining free hemoglobin has a low enough molecular weight to pass through the renal glomerular filter into the urine. This imparts a pink or red discoloration to the urine, called hemoglobinuria. Thus extracellular hemoglobin can cause gross discoloration of the plasma, where it is bound to haptoglobin, before becoming grossly visible in urine. The half-life of haptoglobin is markedly decreased when bound to hemoglobin, so when large amounts of haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex are formed, the concentration of haptoglobin in the blood decreases and hemoglobin can pass through the glomerulus at even lower concentrations. Hemoglobinuria is a contributing factor in the renal tubular necrosis (hemoglobinuric nephrosis) that often occurs in cases of acute intravascular hemolysis (see Chapter 11). A similar lesion occurs in the kidneys of individuals with marked muscle damage and resulting myoglobinuria (see Chapters 11 and 15).",

In a case of acute hemorrhage or hemolysis, for example, it typically takes 3 to 4 days until reticulocytosis is evident on the CBC and several more days until the regenerative response peaks. The term preregenerative anemia is sometimes used to describe anemia with a regenerative response that is impending but not yet apparent on the CBC.

Iron deficiency anemia is either poorly regenerative or nonregenerative and is discussed in more detail later in the chapter. Iron deficiency anemia does not occur with chronic internal hemorrhage, Spherocytes form when macrophages (mainly in the spleen) phagocytize part of an erythrocyte plasma membrane bound with autoantibody ( Fig. 13-12) . The remaining portion of the erythrocyte assumes a spherical shape, thus preserving maximal volume. This change in shape results in decreased deformability of the cells. Erythrocytes must be extremely pliable to traverse the splenic red pulp and sinusoidal walls; spherocytes therefore tend to be retained in the spleen in close association with macrophages with risk for further injury and eventual destruction. In the dog, spherocytes appear smaller than normal and have uniform staining ( Fig. 13-13 , A), in contrast to normal erythrocytes, which have a region of central pallor imparted by their biconcave shape. This difference in staining between spherocytes and normal erythrocytes is not consistently discernible in many other domestic animals (including horses, the hemoglobin originated within erythrocytes.

With intravascular hemolysis, free hemoglobin is release directly into the plasma, where it is scavenged by haptoglobin and hemopexin.

However, excessive bilirubin will spill over into the plasma, resulting in hyperbilirubinemia, icteric plasma (if severe enough), and urinary excretion of bilirubin (bilirubinuria; icteric urine).

This predisposition is believed to reflect unique features of the feline erythrocyte, whose hemoglobin has more sulfhydryl groups (preferential sites for oxidative damage) than do erythrocytes of other species and may also have lower intrinsic reducing capacity. It is also possible that the feline spleen does not have as efficient a \"pitting\" function (splenic structure and function are discussed in more detail later in this chapter).",

By itself, mechanical fragmentation hemolysis tends to cause mild or no anemia. Mechanical fragmentation results from trauma or shearing of erythrocytes within blood vessels. Normal erythrocytes may be flowing through abnormal vasculature, such as with heart valve defects, intravascular fibrin deposition (e.g., disseminated intravascular coagulation), vasculitis, or hemangiosarcoma. Alternatively, the red blood cells may be particularly fragile within normal blood vasculature, as occurs with iron deficiency. In either instance, microscopic evidence of mechanical fragmentation includes the presence of erythrocyte fragments (schistocytes [see Fig.  13 -15, C]), erythrocytes with irregular cytoplasmic projections (acanthocytes), erythrocytes with blister-like projections (keratocytes), or ghost cells (see Figs. 13-13, A, 13-15, D, and 13-15, E). membrane proteins, with adhesion of opposing areas of the cell's inner membrane leaflet, and displacement of most of the hemoglobin toward the other side.

Methemoglobin is produced normally in small amounts but reduced back to oxyhemoglobin by the enzyme cytochrome-b 5 reductase (also known as methemoglobin reductase). Methemoglobinemia results when methemoglobin is produced in excessive amounts (because of oxidative insult) or when the normal pathways for maintaining hemoglobin in the Fe 2+ state are impaired (as in cytochrome-b 5 reductase deficiency). When present in sufficiently high concentration (approximately 10% of degradation. Antierythrocyte antibodies bind RBC surface antigens, resulting in RBC opsonization by immunoglobulins (mainly immunoglobulin G [IgG] ) and complement (primarily C3b). Immunoglobulin-or C3b-bound RBCs are phagocytized and digested by sinusoidal macrophages. 2, Spherocytes. Spherocytes form when the membrane of immunoglobulin-or C3b-bound RBCs are phagocytized by macrophages, without removing the entire RBC from circulation. Compared to normal erythrocytes, spherocytes appear smaller, more eosinophilic, and lack central pallor. 3, RBC aggregation (agglutination). RBC aggregation occurs when antierythrocyte immunoglobulins (immunoglobulin M [IgM] or high concentrations of IgG) bind multiple erythrocytes simultaneously. 4, Ghost cells. Antierythrocyte antibodies bind RBC surface antigens, resulting in complement activation and formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). MACs form membrane pores, resulting in rupture of RBCs, and the release of hemoglobin into the circulation. Ghost cells are RBC membrane remnants that lack cytoplasm (hemoglobin normocytic, normochromic anemia). It has long been known that patients with inflammatory or other chronic disease often become anemic, and that this condition results in increased iron stores in the bone marrow. Sequestration of iron may be a bacteriostatic evolutionary adaptation because many bacteria require iron as a cofactor for growth. In recent years, investigators have begun to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying anemia of inflammation. Hepcidin, an acute phase protein and antimicrobial peptide synthesized in the liver, is a key mediator that limits iron availability. Hepcidin expression increases with inflammation, infection, or iron overload and decreases with anemia or hypoxia. Hepcidin exerts its effects by causing functional iron deficiency. It binds to and causes the degradation of the cell surface iron efflux molecule, ferroportin, thus inhibiting both absorption of dietary iron from the intestinal epithelium and export of iron from macrophages and hepatocytes into the plasma ( Fig. 13-16 ). Anemia of inflammation involves factors besides decreased iron availability. Inflammatory cytokines are likely to inhibit erythropoiesis by oxidative damage to and triggering apoptosis of developing erythroid cells, by decreasing expression of Epo and stem cell factor, and by decreasing expression of Epo receptors. In addition, experimentally induced sterile inflammation in cats resulted in shortened erythrocyte survival, indicating that anemia of inflammation is likely also a function of increased erythrocyte destruction.",

Decreased granulopoiesis is analogous to a factory working below normal production level. Ineffective granulopoiesis is analogous to goods that are produced at a normal to increased rate but are damaged during manufacturing and never leave the factory. A left shift is analogous to the factory meeting increased customer demand by shipping out unfinished goods. Cases of persistent, established inflammation are characterized by bone marrow granulocytic hyperplasia and mature neutrophilia, analogous to a factory that has had time to adjust to increased demand and is meeting it more efficiently by increasing its output.",

In these cases, thrombocytosis is transient. In the case of splenectomy, thrombocytosis may be marked but normalizes after several weeks.

There are several causes of lymphocytosis, including age, excessive epinephrine, chronic inflammation, hypoadrenocorticism, and lymphoid neoplasia; lymphoid neoplasms are presented later in the chapter. Young animals normally have higher concentrations of lymphocytes than older animals, and normal healthy young animals may have counts that exceed adult reference values. Because this is not pathologic lymphocytosis, but normal physiologic variation, it is often termed pseudolymphocytosis of young animals. As discussed earlier in the section on neutrophilia, lymphocytosis is also a feature of epinephrine-mediated physiologic leukocytosis, resulting from redistribution of lymphocytes from the blood marginating pool into the blood circulating pool. Epinephrine-mediated lymphocytosis may be more marked than neutrophilia, particularly in cats (lymphocyte counts of > 20,000/\u00b5L are not uncommon). Antigenic stimulation may result in lymphocytosis, which may be marked in rare cases (up to approximately 30,000/\u00b5L in dogs and 40,000/\u00b5L in cats); however, this is not usually the case, even when there is clear evidence of increased immunologic activity in lymphoid tissues. In cases of antigenic stimulation, it is common for a minority of lymphocytes to have \"reactive\" morphologic features-larger lymphocytes with more abundant, deeply basophilic cytoplasm and more open chromatin ( Fig. 13-19 ).

The disorder has been recognized in Great Pyrenees and otterhound dogs and several horse breeds, including a quarter horse, a standardbred, a thoroughbred-cross, a Peruvian Paso mare, and an Oldenburg filly. The \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 molecule has multiple functions but is best known as a fibrinogen receptor that is essential for normal platelet aggregation. Bleeding tendencies vary widely between affected individuals but mainly occur on mucosal surfaces. The condition is characterized by an in vitro lack of response to all platelet agonists and severely impaired clot retraction (i.e., whole blood samples without anticoagulant often fail to clot).

The syndrome has been identified in Hereford, Brangus, and Japanese black cattle, Persian cats, and several nondomestic species. The defective LYST protein results in granule fusion in multiple cell types, including granulocytes, platelets, and melanocytes, as well as abnormal cell function. Individuals with Ch\u00e9diak-Higashi syndrome have severely impaired cellular innate immunity because of neutropenia, impaired leukocyte chemotaxis, and impaired killing by granulocytes and cytotoxic lymphocytes. Platelets lack the dense granules that normally contain key bioactive molecules involved in hemostasis, including platelet agonists, such as ADP and serotonin. In vitro platelet aggregation is severely impaired. As a result, animals with Ch\u00e9diak-Higashi 746.e1 CHAPTER 13 Bone Marrow, Blood Cells, and the Lymphoid/Lymphatic System von Willebrand disease (vWD) is the most common canine hereditary bleeding disorder and has also been described in many other domestic species. The disease actually refers to a group of inherited conditions characterized by a quantitative or qualitative deficiency of vWF. This factor is a multimeric glycoprotein that is stored in platelet \u03b1-granules and endothelial cells and circulates as a complex with coagulation factor VIII. Its primary functions are to stabilize factor VIII and mediate platelet binding to other platelets and subendothelial collagen. Although not technically a platelet disorder, von Willebrand disease is often classified as such because it results in a loss of normal platelet function. Different types of von Willebrand disease vary in terms of mode of inheritance and severity of clinical disease. Type I von Willebrand disease is characterized by low plasma vWF concentration but normal multimeric proportions and a mild to moderate clinical bleeding tendency; it has been reported in many dog breeds. Type II von Willebrand disease is characterized by low vWF concentration, absence of large multimers, and a moderate to severe bleeding tendency; it has been reported in German short-haired pointer and German wirehaired pointer dogs. Type III von Willebrand disease is characterized by absence of vWF and a severe bleeding tendency; familial and sporadic cases have been reported in numerous dog breeds. The buccal mucosal bleeding time is prolonged with von Willebrand disease, often with adequate concentrations of platelets and normal prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time (PTT). However, PTT may be mildly prolonged because vWF stabilizes factor VIII, and deficiency of vWF results in enhanced factor VIII degradation. Grossly, affected animals exhibit bleeding tendencies, especially in the form of Inherited coagulation factor deficiencies have been documented in most domestic species, including deficiencies of prekallikrein and factors I, II, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII. Of these disorders, hereditary coagulation factor VIII (hemophilia A) and factor IX (hemophilia B) deficiencies are most common. Hemophilia A has been recognized in horses, cattle, dogs, and cats, and hemophilia B occurs in dogs and cats. Both disorders have an X-linked recessive mode of inheritance, meaning that clinical disease is more common in males. Affected males have variable tendencies to bleed, depending on the severity of the deficiency, exposure to trauma, and size and activity level of the affected individual. Carrier females are usually asymptomatic. Laboratory tests often reveal adequate platelets, normal prothrombin times, and prolonged partial thromboplastin times.",

Rapidly growing nursing animals may be iron deficient when compared with adults because milk is an iron-poor diet. In most cases this has little clinical significance (and in fact is normal). An important exception is piglets with no access to iron, which may cause anemia, failure to thrive, and increased mortality. Neonatal piglets are routinely given parenteral iron for this reason. Copper deficiency can cause iron deficiency in ruminants and may occur because of copper-deficient forage or impaired usage of copper by high dietary molybdenum or sulfate.

Microcytes and hypochromasia (see Fig. 13 -15, G) may also be discernible on blood smear examination as erythrocytes that are abnormally small and paler-staining, respectively.

In either case, marked hypophosphatemia (e.g., 1 mg/dL in cows, or \u2264 1.5 mg/dL in cats) is thought to decrease erythrocyte production of ATP, leading to inadequate energy required for maintenance of membrane and cytoskeletal integrity. An accompanying decrease in reducing capacity and increase in methemoglobin concentration have also been noted in experimental studies of hypophosphatemic hemolytic anemia in dairy cattle, suggesting that oxidative mechanisms may also contribute to anemia.

Administration of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEpo) has been identified as a cause of secondary pure red cell aplasia in dogs, cats, and horses, presumably caused by induction of antibodies against rhEpo that cross-react with endogenous Epo. Experimentation with the use of speciesspecific recombinant Epo has produced mixed results. Dogs treated with recombinant canine Epo have not developed pure red cell aplasia.

Unlike hemophagocytic histiocytic sarcoma, which is a neoplastic proliferation of phagocytic macrophages, hemophagocytic syndrome is secondary to an underlying disease, such as neoplasia, infection, or an immune-mediated disorder. The primary disease process causes increased production of stimulatory cytokines, which results in macrophage proliferation and hyperactivation. These activated macrophages phagocytize mature hematopoietic cells and hematopoietic precursors at an enhanced rate, resulting in one or more cytopenias. Affected animals usually have lesions of the primary disease, as well as signs of the anemia (e.g., pale mucous membranes), neutropenia (e.g., bacterial infections), and thrombocytopenia (e.g., petechiae and ecchymoses). Microscopically, phagocytic macrophages are found in high numbers in the bone marrow and commonly in other tissues, including lymph nodes, spleen, and liver. Additional bone marrow findings reported in animals with hemophagocytic syndrome vary widely, ranging from hypoplasia to hyperplasia of cell lines with peripheral cytopenias.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation is a syndrome characterized by continuous activation of both coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways and is also known as consumptive coagulopathy. It is not a primary disease, but 754.e1 CHAPTER 13 Bone Marrow, Blood Cells, and the Lymphoid/Lymphatic System Disseminated intravascular coagulation is a consumptive coagulopathy resulting from activation of both coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways. It is a secondary complication of many types of underlying disease, including many infectious diseases, trauma, burns, heat stroke, immune-mediated disease, hemolysis, shock, neoplasia, organ failure, obstetric complications, and noninfectious inflammatory disease, such as pancreatitis. It is common in critically ill domestic animals. Disseminated intravascular coagulation involves an initial hypercoagulable phase, resulting in thrombosis and ischemic tissue damage, and a subsequent hypocoagulable phase as a result of consumption of coagulation factors and platelets, resulting in hemorrhage (E- Fig. 13-5) . The pathogenesis of disseminated intravascular coagulation typically involves the release of tissue factor (thromboplastin) and subsequent activation of coagulation pathways and platelets but may also involve defective normal inhibition of coagulation or defective fibrinolysis. Classically diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation is based on clinical evidence of hemorrhage and/or thromboembolic disease and a triad of laboratory findings: thrombocytopenia, usually moderate (below the lower reference value but above 50,000/\u00b5L); prolonged coagulation times (prothrombin time and/or partial thromboplastin time); and decreased fibrinogen or increased concentration of plasma fibrin degradation products or D-dimer. Milder forms of disseminated intravascular coagulation that do not meet all of the diagnostic criteria also occur. Decreased plasma antithrombin (antithrombin III) concentration and schistocytosis are other laboratory abnormalities often found in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation. dysplasia of myeloid cells, and fewer than 20% myeloblasts and \"blast equivalents.\" 3 Acute Myeloid Leukemia.

In veterinary species, acute myeloid leukemia is most commonly of neutrophil, monocyte, and/or erythroid origin, with rare reports of eosinophil, basophil, or megakaryocytic lineages. It is caused by FeLV infection in cats. Evaluations of blood smears show many early myeloid precursors, including myeloblasts and blast equivalents ( Fig. 13-31, A) . In dogs the total leukocyte concentration averages approximately 70,000/\u00b5L; anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia commonly occur. Grossly, animals show lesions attributed to anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, such as pale mucous membranes, secondary infections, and multisystemic bleeding, respectively.

In fact, one study found that the severity of mastocytemia in dogs was frequently higher in animals without MCTs than those with MCTs and that random detection of mast cells in blood smears usually is not the result of underlying MCT.",

            "text": "Myelodysplastic Syndrome. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) most commonly occurs in dogs and cats and may be caused by FeLV infection in cats. The disease refers to a group of clonal myeloid proliferative disorders with ineffective hematopoiesis in the bone marrow, resulting in cytopenias of more than one cell line. Hematopoietic proliferation in bone marrow with concurrent peripheral blood cytopenias is likely a result of increased apoptosis of neoplastic cells within the bone marrow, before their release into circulation. Clinical illness and death often result from secondary manifestations, such as secondary infections or cachexia, attributable to the effects of cytopenias and/or transformation of the neoplasm into acute myeloid leukemia. Gross lesions are dependent upon the type and severity of the cytopenias. However, essential microscopic findings within the bone marrow are normal or increased cellularity, 3 \"Blast equivalents\" include other stages of immature myeloid cells, such as abnormal promyelocytes, monoblasts, promonocytes, erythroblasts, and megakaryoblasts. Before the discussion of specific diseases, it is worthwhile to describe the diagnostic techniques required to classify hematopoietic neoplasms that are becoming increasingly available for routine use in veterinary medicine. Immunophenotyping refers to the use of antibodies recognizing specific molecules expressed on different cell types to determine the identity of a cell population of interest. Immunophenotyping on the basis of these lineage-specific or lineage-associated markers can be performed on histologic sections (immunohistochemistry [see Fig. 13 -86]), air-dried cytologic examination smears (immunocytochemistry), or by laser analysis of cells in suspension in blood or buffer solutions (flow cytometry). In cases of lymphoid neoplasia, immunophenotyping most routinely refers to determination of B or T lymphocyte origin. Clonality assays, PCR for antigen receptor rearrangement (PARR), can help identify neoplastic lymphoid proliferations on the basis of clonal rearrangements of genes encoding lymphocyte antigen receptors. In terms of practical application the PARR assay is most useful in helping to distinguish lymphoid neoplasms from those nonneoplastic lymphoid proliferations mimicking neoplasia. Cytogenetic testing has not been routinely used in veterinary medicine, though several genetic mutations have been identified in dogs. For example, breakpoint cluster region-Abelson (BCR-ABL) translocations have been identified in some canine leukemias, including acute myeloblastic leukemia and chronic monocytic leukemia. Dogs with Burkitt-like lymphoma have a translocation leading to constitutive c-Myc expression. A B thrombocytopenia commonly occur. Gross and microscopic lesions also are similar to those that occur in cases of acute myeloid leukemia, except that neoplastic cells may differentiate into morphologically identifiable lymphoid cells.",

It is predominantly a disease of middle-aged to older dogs but is also documented in horses, cattle, and cats. Most canine chronic lymphocytic leukemia cases are of T lymphocyte origin, typically cytotoxic T lymphocytes expressing CD8. In cats the majority of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cases have a T helper lymphocyte immunophenotype. A CBC often shows very high numbers of small lymphocytes with clumped chromatin and scant cytoplasm. Proliferating cytotoxic T lymphocytes frequently contain a few pink cytoplasmic granules when stained with most methanol-based Romanowsky stains (e.g., Wright-Giemsa). However, these granules may not be appreciated with some aqueous-based Romanowsky stains (e.g., Diff-Quik). Although the number of total blood lymphocytes is often greater than 100,000/\u00b5L, relatively mild lymphocytosis (e.g., 15,000/\u00b5L) has been reported. Seventy-five percent of affected dogs also have often of eosinophilic or neutrophilic cell lines.

In a recent immunophenotype study of 51 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in dogs, 47 arose from B lymphocytes and 4 arose from double-negative T lymphocytes that were immunonegative for CD4 and CD8 markers. In the blood of animals with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, there are typically many medium to large lymphoid cells with deeply basophilic cytoplasm, reticular to coarse chromatin, and prominent, multiple nucleoli (see Fig. 13-31, C) . In affected dogs the mean blood lymphoid concentration is approximately 70,000/\u00b5L, but cats with acute lymphoblastic leukemia often have low numbers of neoplastic cells in the circulation. As with animals with acute myeloid leukemia, anemia, neutropenia, and C D m the light chains deposit as nonamyloid granules, it is termed light chain deposition disease. Light chains are low-molecular-weight proteins that pass through the glomerular filter into the urine, wherein they are also known as Bence Jones proteins. They tend to not react with urine dipstick protein indicators and are most specifically detected by electrophoresis and immunoprecipitation. In addition to aiding in the diagnosis of multiple myeloma, paraproteins have an important role in pathogenesis of disease. These proteins may inhibit platelet function, increase blood viscosity, deposit in glomerular basement membranes (see Chapter 11; see Figs. 11-27 and 11-28, or precipitate at cool temperatures, which results in bleeding tendencies, hyperviscosity syndrome, glomerulopathies, and cryoglobulinemia, respectively. Hyperviscosity syndrome refers to the clinical sequelae of pathologically increased blood viscosity, which are slowed blood flow and loss of laminar flow. Clinical signs include mucosal hemorrhages, visual impairment due to retinopathy, and neurologic signs, such as tremors and abnormal aggressive behavior. Cryoglobulinemia is the condition in which proteins, typically IgM, precipitate at temperatures below normal body temperature (cold agglutinins). Precipitation often occurs in blood vessels of the skin and extremities, such as the ears and digits, and results in ischemic necrosis.",

Therefore they have the same migration pattern using serum protein electrophoresis, which results in a tall, narrow spike in the globulins region, termed monoclonal gammopathy (see Fig. 13-32, B) . The term gammopathy is used because most immunoglobulins migrate in the \u03b3-region of an electrophoresis gel. However, some immunoglobulins, especially immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgM, migrate to the \u03b2-region. Occasionally, biclonal or other atypical electrophoretic patterns may be seen with multiple myeloma as a result of protein degradation, protein complex formation, binding to other proteins, or when the tumor includes more than one clonal population. It is important to note that monoclonal gammopathy is not specific to multiple myeloma but has also been reported with lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, canine ehrlichiosis, and canine leishmaniasis.

Formalin fixation (in this case by formaldehyde fumes) destroys the differential staining seen with Romanowsky stains such as Wright's and Giemsa and results in diffuse blue staining. Prompt transfer of biopsy or postmortem specimens into fixative is crucial because delayed fixation can lead to numerous artifacts, including an artificial decrease in mitotic index (up to 40% reduction with a more than 12-hour delay in fixation); this reduction can alter tumor classification and grade. The current recommendation for the duration of formalin fixation is 16 to 32 hours; complete fixation of 2-to 4-mm thick tissues is likely to be achieved after 24 to 48 hours. Both underfixation and overfixation may lead to difficulties with antigen retrieval for immunohistochemistry, though underfixation is considered the more common and serious problem.",

In the dog the marginal sinus drains into the sinusoids, but in other domestic animals it drains into the red pulp vascular spaces. The central arteries leave the white pulp, enter the red pulp, and branch into smaller penicillar arterioles. Each arteriole is surrounded by a sheath of macrophages known as periarteriolar macrophage sheaths (PAMS, previously known as ellipsoids), which are notably prominent in pigs, dogs, and cats. In horses, cattle, pigs, and cats the terminal branches of the penicillar arterioles empty into the red pulp vascular spaces lined by reticular cells. Because the red pulp vascular spaces are not lined by endothelium, this type of circulation is known as an open system. This system is in contrast to the sinusoidal spleen of the dog (also of the rat and human beings), where the branches of the central artery of the white pulp and vessels from the marginal sinus enter into the sinusoids, which are lined by a discontinuous endothelium, and these empty into splenic venules. This type of circulation is known as a closed system because the blood flow is through blood vessels (arterioles, capillaries, sinusoids, and venules), all of which are lined by endothelium. Although circulation in the red pulp is anatomically open in nonsinusoidal spleens, under certain conditions (e.g., during splenic contraction) the circulation is functionally closed, and the blood in the red pulp is particulate matter and senescent cells; (2) transporting recirculating lymphocytes and na\u00efve B and T lymphocytes to the follicle and PALS, respectively, to fulfill their specific immune functions; and (3) storage of blood in some domestic animal species (dog, cat, and horse) (Fig. 13-41) . Phagocytosis is particularly effective in the spleen because blood flows through areas within the red pulp that are populated with increased concentrations of macrophages, namely, within the marginal sinuses, in cuffs around the penicillar arteries (PAMS), diffusely on the reticular walls of the red pulp vascular spaces, and along the sinusoids in dogs. Trafficking of na\u00efve and recirculating lymphocytes is facilitated by the proximity of the marginal sinus to the follicular germinal centers and PALS.",

Trabecular arteries become the central arteries of the white pulp and are surrounded by cuffs of T lymphocytes forming the PALS. The splenic follicles, populated by B lymphocytes, are eccentrically embedded within or just adjacent to the PALS.

In the dog, macrophages are also located perisinusoidally. The supportive reticular network of the red pulp vascular spaces is composed of a fine meshwork of reticular fibers made of type III collagen, on which macrophages are dispersed. Exactly in which of these concentrations of macrophages phagocytosis of blood-borne particles takes place depends upon (1) the sequence in which they are exposed to the incoming blood, (2) the concentration of macrophages in these areas (e.g., the cat marginal sinus is small and thus not a major site of clearance; there is a compensatory increase in PAMS for phagocytosis), and (3) the functions of the macrophages. Some of the macrophages in the marginal sinus and marginal zone are responsible for phagocytosis of particulate matter and others for the trapping and ingestion of antigens and antigen-antibody complexes. Macrophages responsible for phagocytosis of blood-borne foreign material (Fig. 13-44) , bacteria, and senescent and/or damaged erythrocytes (e.g., as seen in immune-mediated anemias and infections with hemotropic parasites) are also found in the red pulp. In the dog, sinusoidal macrophages remove entire erythrocytes (erythrophagocytosis), as well as portions of an erythrocyte's membrane and cytoplasmic inclusions, such as nuclear remnants like Heinz bodies, by a process called pitting. As such, the presence of large numbers of nuclear remnants in erythrocytes in canine blood smears may indicate malfunction of the sinusoidal system. The normal rate of removal of senescent erythrocytes from the circulating blood does not cause an increase in size of the spleen; however, splenomegaly can be observed when large numbers of defective erythrocytes must be removed, as in cases of severe acute hemolytic anemia. Nonsinusoidal spleens lack the fenestrated endothelium and perisinusoidal macrophages of canine sinusoids that allow for slow processing of red blood cells to determine which are to be returned to the Equine, canine, and feline spleens all have considerable storage and contractile capacity because of their muscular capsule, increased numbers of trabeculae, and the relatively small amount of splenic parenchyma devoted to white pulp. The storage capacity in dogs and horses is remarkable: It has been claimed that the canine spleen can store one-third of the dog's erythrocytes while the animal sleeps and the equine spleen holds one-half of the animal's circulating red cell mass (which is considered advantageous because it reduces the viscosity of the circulating blood). Storage spleens expand and contract quickly under the influence of the autonomic nervous system, via sympathetic and vagal fibers in the trabeculae and reticular walls of the red pulp vascular spaces and other circulatory disruptions, such as hypovolemic and/or cardiogenic shock. Thus storage spleens may be either grossly enlarged and congested or small with a wrinkled surface and a dry parenchyma depending on whether the spleen is congested from stored blood or shrunken from contraction (see Uniform Splenomegaly and Small Spleens).",

Studies have indicated that splenic EMH in dogs and cats most commonly occurs with degenerative or inflammatory circulation, pitted, or phagocytized. Instead, the macrophages of the red pulp perform these functions, and phagocytized cells remain in the red pulp vascular spaces. The location of the primary sites of pitting in nonsinusoidal spleens is unclear, but it is likely that most erythrophagocytosis takes place in the red pulp vascular spaces.

The ability to store blood in the spleen depends on the fibromuscular composition of the splenic capsule and trabeculae. Splenic capsules and trabeculae with a low percentage of smooth muscle and elastic fibers cannot expand and contract and are designated as defense spleens. These are found in rabbits and human beings. The spleens of other domestic animal species have distention of the red pulp from stored blood separates the foci of white pulp (PALS and lymphoid follicles), making white pulp appear sparser. Splenic white pulp is organized around central arteries in the form of PALS, which are populated primarily by T lymphocytes (see . Primary splenic follicles are located eccentrically in PALS and are primarily composed of B lymphocytes. When exposed to antigen, the splenic lymphoid follicles develop germinal centers (see Lymphoid/ Lymphatic System, Lymph Nodes, Function) . Macrophages in the white pulp follicles remove apoptotic B lymphocytes not selected for expansion because of low binding affinity for antigen. Failure of these macrophages to phagocytize has been experimentally correlated with decreased production of growth factors like TGF-\u03b2 and increased production of inflammatory cytokines that predispose the animal to autoimmune conditions. The marginal zone surrounds the marginal sinus at the interface of the white and red pulp and consists of macrophages, DCs, and T and B lymphocytes. The blood supply of the marginal sinus is from conditions (e.g., hematomas, thrombosis) and may occur without concomitant hematologic disease (see Uniform Splenomegaly with a Firm Consistency). It is also found in splenic nodular hyperplasia (see Splenic Nodules with a Firm Consistency). In some species, such as the mouse, EMH is a normal function of the adult spleen and not necessarily a response to disease or hypoxic challenge. The splenic red pulp also contains large numbers of monocytes, which function as a reserve for generating tissue macrophages in response to ongoing tissue inflammation in the body.",

The red pulp macrophages function primarily to filter the blood by phagocytizing particles and by removing senescent or infected erythrocytes and pathogenic bacteria and fungi. Marginal zone macrophages are divided into two types based on their location and the type of cell surface receptors they possess. The first group is positioned toward the periphery of the marginal zone, whereas the second group, the marginal metallophilic macrophages (so called for their silver staining positivity), is at the inner margin of the marginal zone closer to the splenic follicle and PALS. It has been difficult to generate mammalian models that eliminate one of the two classes of marginal zone macrophages, so the degree to which one group specializes in a particular function is not clear. Some marginal zone macrophages actively phagocytize particulate matter or bacteria (e.g., septicemias caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, or Bacillus anthracis) in the blood (see Fig. 13-40) . They also play a similar role in limiting the spread of viral infections. Other marginal zone macrophages phagocytize and process antigens. Thus macrophages of the marginal zone serve to bridge the innate and adaptive immune responses by secreting inflammatory cytokines to activate other immune cells and providing receptor-based activation of marginal zone lymphocytes. Studies have shown that a loss of marginal zone macrophages coincides with decreased antigen trapping by resident B lymphocytes of the marginal zone and consequently a decrease in the early IgM response to antigens.",

The extent to which macrophages of the monocyte-macrophage system phagocytize particles depends to a large degree on the sequence in which they receive blood.

To understand the pathologic response of the lymph node, it is important to consider its anatomic components and their relationship with antigen processing (Fig. 13-46) : organisms multiply rapidly and may disseminate widely in the body to cause an overwhelming postsplenectomy infection. Studies have also shown that the phagocytic function of the spleen is critical in the control of plasmodium (causative agent of malaria) in human beings and babesiosis in cattle. If the number of pathogenic bacteria in the circulation exceeds the capacity of the splenic macrophages, as in cases of severe septicemia, it may result in acute splenic congestion (see Uniform Splenomegaly with a Bloody Consistency).

It is helpful to consider the paths taken by particles, molecules, antigens, and cells arriving at a lymph node. The following account describes the journey of an antigen as it enters a lymph node to trigger an immune response. Antigen in the lymph arriving in the afferent lymphatic vessels empties into the subcapsular sinus. Hydrostatic pressure here is low, and reticular fibers crossing the sinus impede flow, and thus particles tend to settle, which facilitates phagocytosis by the sinus macrophages. Lymph then flows down the trabecular sinuses that line the outer surface of fibrous trabeculae, to the medullary sinus, and eventually exits via efferent vessels. As antigens within the lymph travel through the sinuses, they are captured and processed by macrophages and DCs. Alternatively, DCs charged with antigen can migrate within blood vessels to the node and enter the paracortex via the HEVs. Circulating B lymphocytes also enter across the HEVs, and if they encounter antigen-bearing DCs, there is a local reaction involving the appropriate T helper lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and DCs.

During this process most centroblasts undergo apoptosis, and cell fragments are phagocytized by macrophages, which are then termed tingible (stainable) body macrophages. The cells that have survived the affinity maturation process are now called centrocytes and along with T lymphocytes and follicular DCs, populate the germinal center light zone. These post-germinal center B lymphocytes leave the follicle as plasma cell precursors (immunoblasts or plasmablasts) and migrate from the cortex to the medullary cords, where they mature and excrete antibody into the efferent lymph. Some of these cells may colonize the region surrounding the mantle cell zone to form a marginal zone. Marginal zones are apparent only in situations of prolonged and intense immune stimulation and serve as a reservoir of memory cells. The elliptical mantle cell cuff is wider over the light pole of the follicle, though in instances of strong antigenic stimulation, the cuffs can completely encircle the germinal center.",

First, all lymph nodes throughout the body (systemic or generalized) may be enlarged (lymphadenopathy or lymphadenomegaly). This pattern is usually attributed to systemic infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic processes. If a single lymph node or regional chain of nodes is enlarged, then the area drained by that node should be checked for lesions (e.g., evaluate the oral cavity if the mandibular lymph nodes are enlarged). Thus it is important to know the area drained by specific lymph nodes. Mesenteric lymph nodes are normally larger because of follicular Approximately 90% to 95% of lymphocytes enter lymph nodes through the HEVs, which also play an important role in lymph fluid balance. The lymphatic vasculature consists of afferent lymphatic vessels, which pierce the capsule and drain into the subcapsular sinus. Lymph continues to drain through the trabecular sinuses to the medullary sinuses and finally exits at the hilus via efferent lymphatic vessels.",

            "text": "Gross examination of the spleen involves deciding whether the spleen is enlarged (splenomegaly), normal, or small (see E-Appendix 13-2). Diffuse enlargement of the spleen may be due to congestion (termed bloody spleen) or other infiltrative disease (termed meaty spleen). The cut surface of congested spleens will exude blood, whereas meaty spleens are more firm and do not readily ooze blood. The diseases and disorders having splenomegaly are discussed using the following categories, which list the common causes of uniform splenomegaly (Table 13-6): \u2022 Uniform splenomegaly with a bloody consistency (bloody spleen) ( Fig. 13-54 , A) \u2022 Uniform splenomegaly with a firm consistency (meaty spleen) (see Fig. 13-54 , B) \u2022 Splenic nodules with a bloody consistency \u2022 Splenic nodules with a firm consistency Uniform Splenomegaly with a Bloody Consistency-Bloody Spleen. The common causes of a bloody spleen are (1) congestion (due to gastric volvulus with splenic entrapment, splenic volvulus Chemotherapeutic drugs inhibit the cell cycle through various mechanisms, and thus all dividing cells, including lymphocytes, bone marrow cells, and enterocytes, are sensitive to their effects. As such, bone marrow suppression, immunosuppression, and gastrointestinal disturbances are common side effects of anticancer drugs. Purine analogues (e.g., azathioprine) compete with purines in the synthesis of nucleic acids, whereas alkylating agents like cyclophosphamide cross-link DNA and inhibit the replication and activation of lymphocytes. Cyclosporin A specifically inhibits the T lymphocyte signaling pathway by interfering with the transcription of the IL-2 gene. Methotrexate, a folic acid antagonist, blocks the synthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. The immunosuppressive effects of some of these agents is desirable for the treatment of immune-mediated disease (e.g., immune-mediated hemolytic anemia) or to prevent allograft rejection after transplantation. Corticosteroids may be given at an immunosuppressive dose, though the degree of suppression is highly variable among species. Local or palliative treatment of cancer may include radiotherapy (ionizing radiation) to target and damage the DNA of the neoplastic cells. Although some immunosuppression may be noted, particularly if bone marrow or lymphoid tissue is within the therapeutically irradiated field, mounting evidence suggests that radiotherapy can induce a cascade of proimmunogenic effects that engage the innate and adaptive immune systems to contribute to the destruction of tumor cells.",

Thymic lymphoma arises from the T lymphocytes in the thymus (and very rarely B lymphocytes). It is most often seen in young cats and cattle and less frequently in dogs (Fig. 13-53 ) (see Hematopoietic Neoplasia). Thymomas arise from the epithelial component and are usually benign neoplasms that occupy the cranial mediastinum of older animals. Histologically, these neoplasms consist of clustered or individualized neoplastic epithelial cells, often outnumbered by nonneoplastic small lymphocytes (\"lymphocyte-rich thymoma\"). Thymomas are common in goats and often contain large cystic structures. Immunemediated diseases, including myasthenia gravis and immunemediated polymyositis, occur with thymomas in dogs, and also rarely in cats. Myasthenia gravis is caused by autoantibodies directed toward the acetylcholine receptors, which lead to destruction of postsynaptic membranes and reduction of acetylcholine receptors at neuromuscular junction. Megaesophagus and aspiration pneumonia are common sequelae to this condition. (syn: necropsy) in horses and dogs that have been euthanized or anesthetized with barbiturates. Grossly, the spleen is extremely enlarged (Fig. 13-55) , and the cut surface bulges and oozes copious blood. Because of the splenic distention, the splenic capsule can be fragile and easily ruptured. Histologically, the red pulp is distended by erythrocytes, and the lymphoid tissues of the white pulp are small and widely separated (Fig. 13-56 ). Electric stunning of pigs at slaughter may result in a large congested spleen; the mechanism is unknown, but it should not be confused with a pathologically congested spleen.

Therefore in cases of chronic hemolytic disease, splenomegaly is attributed to diffuse proliferation of macrophages, phagocytosis, and concurrent hyperplasia of the white pulp due to ongoing antigenic stimulation. For example, equine infectious anemia has cyclical periods of viremia, with immune-mediated damage to erythrocytes and platelets, and phagocytosis to remove altered erythrocytes and platelets.

Splenic rupture is most commonly caused by trauma, such as from an automobile accident or being kicked by other animals.

Grossly, affected lymph nodes in acute lymphadenitis are red and edematous, have taut capsules, and may have necrotic areas ( Fig. 13-76 ). In some instances the afferent lymphatic vessels may also be inflamed (lymphangitis). The material draining to the regional lymph node may be microorganisms (bacteria, parasites, protozoa, and fungi), inflammatory mediators, or a sterile irritant. In septicemic diseases, such as bovine anthrax, the lymph nodes are markedly congested and the sinuses filled with blood. Examination of these lymph nodes should include culturing for bacteria and the examination of smears and histologic sections for bacteria and fungi. Pyogenic bacteria, such as Streptococcus equi ssp. equi in horses , Streptococcus porcinus in pig, and Trueperella pyogenes in cattle and sheep, cause acute suppurative lymphadenitis (see Disorders of Horses and Disorders of Pigs).",

Recurrent Figure 13 -76 Acute Lymphadenitis, Lymph Node, Dog. Acute lymphadenitis usually occurs when a regional lymph node drains a site of inflammation caused by microorganisms and subsequently becomes infected. The lymph node is firm and enlarged with a tense capsule. The cut surface bulges and is wet with blood, edema, and an inflammatory cell infiltrate. histoplasmosis (see Disorders in Dogs). In feline cryptococcosis (most often Cryptococcus neoformans), the inflammatory response may be mild due to the thick polysaccharide capsule, which has strong immunomodulatory properties and promotes immune evasion and survival within the host. Therefore the nodal enlargement is due mainly to a large mass of organisms (see E- Fig. 13-12) . Pigs with PCV2 infection may have a multifocal to diffuse infiltrate of macrophages and multinucleated giant cells of varying severity (see Disorders of Pigs). Secondary (Metastatic) Neoplasms. Carcinomas typically metastasize via lymphatic vessels to the regional lymph node. Other common metastatic neoplasms include mast cell tumor and malignant melanoma. Although sarcomas most often metastasize hematogenously, some more aggressive sarcomas (e.g., osteosarcoma) may spread to regional lymph nodes. Histologically, single cells or clusters of neoplastic cells travel via the afferent lymphatic vessels and are deposited in a sinus, usually the subcapsular sinus (see Fig.  13 -47). Here the cells proliferate and can ultimately occupy the whole lymph node, as well as drain to the next lymph node in the chain. tuberculosis), but once disseminated in the lymph or blood, lymph nodes throughout the body will have lesions. Well-organized granulomas consist of a central mass of macrophages with phagocytized mycobacteria, surrounded by epithelioid and foamy macrophages and occasional multinucleated giant cells (Langhans type). These inflammatory nodules are surrounded by a layer of lymphocytes enclosed in a fibrous capsule. Over time the center of the granuloma may undergo caseous necrosis due to the high lipid and protein content of the dead macrophages (see Chapter 3). In bovine Johne's disease the mesenteric lymph nodes draining the infected intestine can have noncaseous granulomas (Fig. 13-82 ).",

However, a select number of subtypes are more commonly seen in domestic animals (see Table  13 -7) and currently best described in the dog (see Disorders of Dogs, Neoplasms, Lymphomas). The most common types in dogs are large cell lymphomas and include diffuse large B cell lymphoma and peripheral T cell lymphoma. T cell-rich large B cell lymphoma is thought to be a variant of diffuse large B cell lymphoma with a distinctive reactive T lymphocyte infiltrate. Intermediate cell lymphomas include B or T lymphocyte lymphoblastic lymphomas and Burkitt-like lymphoma (both high grade), marginal zone lymphoma, and the intermediate cell variant of T zone lymphomas (both indolent and nodular). Small cell lymphomas most commonly diagnosed in domestic animal species include enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma, commonly seen in the cat, T zone lymphoma (small cell variant), and small cell lymphoma. Cutaneous lymphomas are most often of T lymphocyte origin and may be epitheliotropic or nonepitheliotropic, and a distinct entity of inflamed T cell lymphoma has been recently described in dogs (see Chapter 17).

            "text": "Bovine lymphoma is broadly classified into enzootic and sporadic forms. The enzootic form, called enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL), is caused by BLV, a retrovirus common in cattle. There is a higher prevalence in dairy cattle compared to beef breeds. BLV is transmitted horizontally (e.g., blood, milk/colostrum, saliva) or iatrogenically (e.g., rectal sleeves, instruments/equipment). Following infection, BLV invades and integrates into the genome of infected B lymphocytes, resulting in a polyclonal B lymphocyte lymphocytosis in approximately 30% of cattle. In approximately 1% to 5% of BLV-infected cattle, a single clone will emerge, leading to the development of B lymphocyte leukemia/lymphoma. The average incubation period between infection and development of lymphoma is 7 to 8 years, and this low conversion rate suggests that the latency period may be longer than the life span of most animals (dairy cattle seldom live to the 7-to 8-year peak incidence of lymphoma occurrence). Other contributing variables, such as genetic background, coinfections, and environmental factors, may also play a role in lymphomagenesis. The exact mechanism of BLV-induced tumorigenesis is poorly understood. Recently BLV microRNAs (miRNAs) were identified in preleukemic and malignant B lymphocytes, which showed repression of structural and regulatory gene expression. These findings suggested that miRNAs may play a key role in tumor onset and progression.",

Of the three sporadic forms, the cutaneous form seems to be the most common and manifests itself as multiple skin nodules in 1-to 3-year-old cattle. The calf form presents as generalized lymphadenopathy with weight loss, lethargy, and weakness in calves less than 6 months old. The thymic form is reportedly more common in beef cattle, 6 to 24 months of age. Lymphoma is the most frequently reported cancer of pigs based on abattoir surveys. Affected pigs are typically less than 1 year of age, and there is no reported breed predisposition, although a hereditary basis is suspected in cases arising in inbred herds. The two main forms of porcine lymphoma are thymic/mediastinal and multicentric; the latter is more common. Spleen, liver, kidney, bone marrow, and lymph nodes are affected in the multicentric form, with visceral lymph nodes reportedly more commonly involved than peripheral nodes. A recent study of lymphoma in 17 pigs found the majority to be multicentric, and subtypes included the following: B lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, diffuse and intestinal large B cell lymphoma, and peripheral T cell lymphoma.

A mutation in DNA-PKcs (similar to Arabian horses) with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance is seen in Jack Russell terriers. An X-linked form of severe combined immunodeficiency disease is well described in basset hounds and is caused by mutations in the common \u03b3-chain (\u03b3c) subunit of the receptors for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21. A similar disease is seen in Cardigan Welsh corgi puppies, though it is an autosomal mode of inheritance in this breed. The mutation inhibits the signal transduction pathways initiated by any of these cytokines, which are critical for the proliferation, differentiation, survival, and function of B and T lymphocytes. Affected dogs have normal numbers of circulating B lymphocytes that are unable to class switch to IgG or IgA and reduced numbers of T lymphocytes, which are nonfunctional due to the inability to express IL receptors. Affected puppies are remarkably susceptible to bacterial and viral infections and rarely survive past 3 to 4 months of age. The thymus of these dogs is small and consists of only small dysplastic lobules with a few of Hassall's corpuscles. Tonsils, lymph nodes, and Peyer's patches are often grossly unidentifiable due to the severe lymphocyte hypoplasia. Congenital immunodeficiency diseases are also discussed in detail in Chapter 5.",

Lymphoblastic lymphoma may be of B or T lymphocyte origin, though T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma is more common of the two. It is important to recognize a common misuse of the term \"lymphoblast\" in lymphoblastic lymphoma-by definition in lymphoblastic lymphoma, lymphoblasts are intermediate-sized cells with a distinct dispersed chromatin pattern, and not the large lymphocytes seen in cases of diffuse large B cell lymphoma or peripheral T cell lymphoma. T lymphocyte lymphoblastic lymphoma is an aggressive disease that is often resistant to treatment. Burkitt-like lymphoma is a high-grade lymphoma of B lymphocytes. Consequently there is marked lymphoid atrophy of thymus, spleen, lymph node, and MALT (particularly Peyer's patches).",

Mediastinal or multicentric lymphomas are seen in young, FeLV-infected cats (see Fig. 13 -53). With the advent of FeLV vaccine and routine testing, the prevalence of FeLV-associated lymphoma is decreased. Currently the alimentary tract is the most commonly affected site, and typically occurs in cats greater than 10 years of age . Other miscellaneous sites commonly affected are brain, spinal cord, eye, kidney, and nasopharynx. The retrovirus FeLV has long been recognized as a cause of lymphoma in cats-the risk for lymphoma is increased sixtyfold in infected cats. Before the advent of a vaccine in 1985, approximately 70% of cats (mainly young animals) with lymphoma were FeLV positive. FeLV infects T lymphocytes and can cause myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemias (see Myeloid Neoplasia), and T lymphocyte leukemia/lymphoma. In the latter the mediastinum (thymus, mediastinal, and sternal lymph nodes) is the site most commonly involved, although a multicentric distribution also occurs. Routine FeLV vaccination has led to a significant decrease in the prevalence of FeLV infection, which has resulted in a decrease in the proportion of mediastinal lymphomas.",

            "text": "The risk for developing lymphoma in FIV-infected cats is fivefold to sixfold higher than in uninfected cats. Cats that underwent kidney transplantation and thus received immunosuppressive drug therapy had a similar risk for developing lymphoma. Both FIVinfected and posttransplantation cats predominantly developed extranodal, high-grade, diffuse large B lymphocyte lymphomas. This form is also the most common subtype in human immunodeficiency virus and posttransplantation patients caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Therefore it is reasonable to question whether these two groups of immunosuppressed cats may be more prone to infection by a gammaherpesvirus similar to EBV, leading to lymphoma. Recently a novel feline gammaherpesvirus (FcaGHV1) was multiple peripheral lymphadenomegaly (often mandibular lymph nodes) in otherwise healthy-appearing dogs. The characteristic histopathologic architecture is a nodular expansion of the paracortex by neoplastic cells, which push atrophied \"fading\" cortical follicles against the thinned capsule and trabeculae. This unique architectural feature is best highlighted with immunohistochemical stains (often CD3 for T lymphocytes and CD79a, pax5, or CD20 for B lymphocytes). The neoplastic cells are small to intermediate in size with pale eosinophilic cytoplasm and oval nuclei with sharp shallow indentations. Mitotic figures are rare. Dogs with this lymphoma subtype tend to be diagnosed with an advanced stage of the disease, likely because they present clinically healthy, without loss of appetite or activity level. Even so, dogs with T zone lymphoma have a relatively long survival time compared to other lymphomas: reports on median survival time range from 13 to 33 months, and data suggest that dogs who do not receive chemotherapy actually have longer median survival times.",

Most marginal zone lymphomas (and mantle cell lymphomas) are assumed to originate in the spleen with slow spread to lymph nodes and often present as a mottled white-red smooth spherical splenic mass. Histopathologic assessment of tissue architecture is needed for a diagnosis of marginal zone lymphoma and is characterized by a distinct nodular pattern in which the lighter-staining neoplastic marginal zone cells form a dense cuff around small foci of darkly stained mantle cells (fading follicles). The neoplastic marginal zone lymphocytes are intermediate in size and have a single prominent central nucleolus.

Additionally, lymphoid and complex nodular hyperplasia are common in the dog spleen (see Disorders of Dogs), and it is possible that many cases of nodular hyperplasia contain areas of marginal zone lymphoma. Therefore immunophenotyping and molecular clonality are ultimately required for a definitive diagnosis of marginal zone lymphoma. The overall median survival time in dogs with splenic marginal zone lymphoma after splenectomy is approximately 13 months (even longer if it is diagnosed as an incidental finding).",

FPV is transmitted by the fecal-oral route through contact with infected body fluids, feces, or fomites. Following intranasal or oral infection, the virus initially replicates in the macrophages in the lamina propria of the oropharynx and regional lymph nodes, followed by viremia, which distributes the virus throughout the body. Because FPV requires rapidly multiplying cells in the S phase of division for its replication, replication occurs in mitotically active tissues (lymphoid tissue, bone marrow, and intestinal mucosa). By infecting lymphoid tissues, FPV causes immunosuppression directly through lymphocytolysis and of the small intestine. The neoplastic cells are small (nuclei are equal to the diameter of a feline RBC), mitotic figures are infrequent (low grade), and mucosal and crypt epitheliotropism is common (see Fig. 13-95) . A diagnosis of this subtype of lymphoma may be difficult (particularly in endoscopic biopsy samples), because this disease often is multifocal and concurrent with or arises within lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The neoplastic lymphocytes are morphologically similar to the inflammatory lymphocytes. Early small cell mucosal T cell lymphomas often require additional diagnostic testing, namely, immunohistochemistry and molecular clonality testing (PCR for antigen receptor rearrangement [PARR]) to confirm a clonal neoplasm.",

            "text": "Grossly, incompletely contracted areas are characterized by multiple, variably sized and irregularly shaped, dark red to black, raised, soft, blood-filled \"nodules.\" These areas are usually at the margins of the spleen, and the intervening tissues are depressed and pink-red, corresponding to the contracted portions of red pulp devoid of blood. Incompletely contracted areas may be confused with acute splenic infarcts or hematomas on gross examination.Acute Splenic Infarcts. Splenic infarcts are wedge-shaped or triangular hemorrhagic lesions that occur primarily at the margins of the spleen. In dogs, splenic infarcts most often occur with hypercoagulable states (e.g., liver disease, renal disease, Cushing's disease), neoplasia, and cardiovascular disease. Splenic vein thrombi may occur in association with traumatic reticulitis, splenic abscesses, portal vein thrombosis, and arterial thrombosis in bovine theileriosis in cattle. Valvular endocarditis may also lead to multiorgan infarcts, including the spleen. Splenic infarcts are common in pigs with classical swine fever.Acute splenic infarcts may not always be grossly visible in the early stages but develop into discrete, dark red and blood-filled, bulging, wedge-shaped foci with the base toward the splenic capsule ( Fig. 13-64, A) . With chronicity the lesion becomes gray-white and contracted due to fibrosis (see Fig. 13 -64, B).Hemangiosarcoma. Hemangiosarcoma is a malignant neoplasm of endothelial cells and is a common primary tumor of the spleen, especially in dogs. Benign splenic hemangiomas are extraordinarily rare. Grossly, hemangiosarcomas may appear as single, multifocal, or coalescing dark red-purple masses and cannot be easily differentiated from a hematoma ( Fig. 13-65 ). On cut surface they are bloody with varying amounts of soft red neoplastic tissue; in more solid areas the neoplasm can be slightly more firm and whitetan. Metastatic spread occurs early in the disease process. Seeding of the peritoneum results in numerous discrete red-black masses throughout the omentum and serosa of abdominal organs, and hematogenous spread to liver and lung are common. Hemangiosarcomas in dogs also occur in the right atrium of the heart, retroperitoneal fat, and skin (dermal and/or subcutaneous) and multiorgan hemangiosarcomas are described in horses, cats, and cattle. Because hemangiosarcomas have often metastasized at the time of initial accumulations of macrophages within several organs, including splenic macrophages, Kupffer cells of the liver, and macrophages in the brain are often observed.Splenic Nodules with a Bloody Consistency. The most common disorders of the spleen with bloody nodules are (1) hematomas, including those induced by nodular hyperplasia or occurring with hemangiosarcoma, (2) incompletely contracted areas of the spleen, (3) acute splenic infarcts, and (4) hemangiosarcomas. The term nodule has been applied rather loosely here. In some of these conditions, such as incompletely or irregularly contracted areas of the spleen, the elevated area of the spleen is not as well defined as the term nodule would imply.Hematomas. Bleeding into the red pulp to form a hematoma is confined by the splenic capsule, and produces a red to dark red, soft, bulging, usually solitary mass of varying size (2 to 15 cm in diameter) (Fig. 13-62 ). Resolution of a splenic hematoma progresses over days to weeks, through the stages of coagulation and breakdown of the blood into a dark red-brown soft mass (Fig. 13-63, A) , infiltration by macrophages that phagocytize erythrocytes and break down hemoglobin to form hematoidin and hemosiderin (see Fig. 13-63 , B), and repair leading to fibrosis. On occasion the capsule (splenic capsule and visceral peritoneum) over the hematoma can rupture, resulting in hemoperitoneum, hypovolemic shock, and death.The origin or cause of many hematomas is unknown. Some are due to trauma, and others may also be induced by splenic nodular hyperplasia. It is postulated that as the splenic follicles become hyperplastic they distort the adjacent marginal zone and marginal sinus, which compromises their drainage into sinusoids and red pulp vascular spaces. The result is an accumulation of pooled blood surrounding the hyperplastic nodule, which leads to hematoma formation. Splenic hematomas can also occur secondary to the rupture of hemangiosarcomas within the spleen.Incompletely Contracted Areas of the Spleen. Incompletely or irregularly contracted areas of the spleen are caused by failure of the smooth muscle to contract in response to circulatory shock (hypovolemic, cardiogenic, or septic) or sympathetic \"fight-or-flight\" response, resulting in a lack of splenic evacuation of stored blood.
