After combined application, FeLV ELISA antibody titres were unaltered, However antibody production based on indirect immunofluorescence assay was remarkably enhanced for FCV and was at selected time points also enhanced for FHV-1 and C. felis but diminished for FPV. The use of these vaccines in combination was safe and will simplify vaccination schedules in veterinary practice.",

Vaccines should, as far as possible be free of adverse side effects and show high antigenicity. For practical reasons, it has become common to combine several feline vaccines within a single syringe, thereby reducing the animal's injection-related stress as well as costs [1] . When different antigens present in a mixture are inoculated simultaneously, competition with respect to stimulation of the immune system may occur [2] . However, combined application could also augment or modulate the quality of the immune response elicited [3] . Therefore, when different immunogens are to be combined in one injection, the immunogenicity of the individual antigens should be evaluated.",

If successful, the results of this study should also be used as part of a submission for regulatory purposes. A preliminary vaccine compatibility test in vitro was performed to evaluate the effects of the aluminium hydroxide and QS-21 adjuvants contained in the FeLV vaccine on the viability of the attenuated live vaccine components. The immunogenicity of the MLV components and C. felis after combination was then tested in vivo by assaying antibodies to the various vaccine antigens. The safety of the vaccines was assessed by observing and recording any systemic or local adverse reaction to the simultaneous injection of both vaccines. The adjuvant included in the recombinant FeLV vaccine is known to stimulate both, the Th1 and Th2 immune response and its presence in any vaccine might have an effect on all components injected together. In order to characterize the T-lymphocyte response in the different groups, the expression of IL-2, IL-4 and IFN-\u2425 mRNA was evaluated in lymphocytes by C. felis-antigen stimulation, by ConA stimulation and by mockstimulation in vitro. C. felis antigen was selected as model stimulans as it was present in the MLV vaccine and could be handled readily.",

The clotted blood samples were centrifuged and an aliquot of serum was taken for clinical biochemical analysis. The remaining serum was stored at \u221220 \u2022 C until required for testing. On day 48, a further 2 ml of blood was collected into evacuated tubes containing heparin (lithium heparin Vacutainer \u00ae , Becton Dickinson) in order to characterise the response of T lymphocytes to non-specific and C. felisantigen stimulation in vitro by measuring their transcription of selected Th1 and Th2 cytokines. The serum samples were tested for the presence of antibodies to FCV, FHV-1, FPV and C. felis by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and to FeLV p45 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively.",

After washing unbound antibodies with PBS, antibodies bound to C. felis were detected by incubation of the wells with a goat anti-cat immunoglobulin fluorescein isothiocyanat conjugate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, USA). Subsequently, 50% glycerol in PBS was added to each well and plates were examined under a UV-light microscope for positive fluorescence of chlamydial inclusions. Antibody titres were expressed as the reciprocal of the last serum dilution showing positive fluorescence in the IFA. Antibodies to FeLV p45, the non-glycosylated form of gp70 were measured by ELISA as described elsewhere [20, 21] .",

Differential blood counts revealed that the reduction of WBC in groups 1 and 2 was mostly due to a transient lymphopenia (mean lymphocyte counts in group 1 = 1200/l, in group 2 = 1230/l and in group 3 = 4830/l, P between groups 1 and 3, 2 and 3 <0.01) and to a lesser degree to decreased neutrophil counts (mean neutrophil counts in group 1 = 3780/l, in group 2 = 3560/l and in group 3 = 7120/l, P between groups 1 and 3, 2 and 3 <0.01), monocytes and eosinophils (data not shown).",

However, the levels of IL-2 mRNA expression in lymphocytes from group 3 were higher after C. felis antigen stimulation than in unstimulated lymphocytes of group 3 cats, P = 0.0355. The pattern of IL-4 expression was similar to that of IL-2 mRNA synthesis, but here, no difference was found between IL-4 mRNA levels of lymphocytes stimulated by C. felis and non-stimulated lymphocytes (P > 0.05). No difference in IFN\u2425 transcription was observed among the groups. An increase in IL-4 expression was found after C. felis-stimulation in the cats of group 1 (P < 0.005).

            "text": "In this study, the question was evaluated whether a MLV vaccine could be injected together in one syringe with a recombinant FeLV vaccine without loss of antigenicity compared with the single immunization of cats by each of the MLV and the FeLV vaccines. To this end, three groups of cats were vaccinated. It would have been interesting to include a forth group in which the cats would have been vaccinated with the MLV and the FeLV vaccine on separate injection sites. As veterinarians are focussing on the use of a single injection and we did not have the means to include this forth group, the question on how the immune response had been in this forth group cannot be answered. Safety-related assessments of a vaccine and its adjuvants should include serum biochemistry, haematology and injection site observation. The combined administration of the multivalent MLV vaccine and FeLV vaccine caused no noticeable increase in side effects as compared to the administration of the separate components and did not induce any undesirable systemic reactions such as fever, depression or loss of appetite. A local reaction to the vaccination was observed in cats of groups 1 and 3. This local inflammatory reaction was almost certainly caused by the FeLV vaccine and was probably related to its aluminium and Quil A adjuvant. However, this side effect is of little clinical relevance and the swelling at the injection site which was comparable with that induced by the single application of the FeLV vaccine disappeared without any treatment within a few days. Aluminium hydroxide is a depot-forming adjuvant that induces the formation of a macrophage-rich granuloma at the vaccine injection site, which prolongs the antigenic stimulus [1] . The adjuvant of the FeLV vaccine component is a non-toxic fraction of Quil A (QS 21) derived from the bark of the South American tree Quillaja saponaria which has significant adjuvant activity [26] . No haematological nor biochemical changes were observed after vaccination with the exception of a transient leukopenia 1 week after the first vaccination (day 6) in both groups vaccinated with the multivalent MLV vaccine. This transient leukopenia was most probably caused by the FPV component of the vaccine and has also been observed by others [27] . It may correspond to the transient leukopenia observed during infection with virulent FPV under field conditions. Both vaccines were thus well tolerated by the cats in the combined application as well as in the single application. Vaccinations took place on day 0 and 21. Antibodies to FCV, FHV-1, FPV and C. felis were determined by IFA and median titres are depicted. Antibodies to the recombinant antigen FeLV p45 were determined by ELISA and are given as percentage of a positive control. In (a) to (d), groups 1 and 2, and in (e) groups 1 and 3 were statistically compared for significant differences ( * ) by the Mann-Whitney U-test (P < 0.05). Fig. 2 . Expression of mRNA of (a) IL-2, (b) IFN\u2425 and (c) IL-4 in Con A stimulated, C. felis-antigen stimulated and unstimulated PBMC cultures. The cytokine expression was normalised to GAPDH, which was set to a theoretical value of 1,000,000 gene copies. Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's multiple comparison test ( * , P < 0.05; ** , P < 0.01; *** , P < 0.005; ns = not significantly different).",

Remarkably, the antibody production against FCV and at selected time points against FHV-1 and C. felis induced by the vaccination was significantly higher after the combined vaccination than after the single vaccination with the multivalent MLV vaccine. In group 1 cats, the antibody titres against FCV, FHV-1 and FPV somewhat declined versus the end of the observation period, especially against FPV after the second vaccination. While no firm explanation for this decrease can be offered, it can be speculated that it represents a natural decline after exposure to the antigen had peaked to high levels. In the cats of group 3 (vaccinated solely with the FeLV vaccine), low titres against FCV were observed on days 14, 34 and 48. As these groups were completely separated from each other, these low titres most likely do not indicate that the cats became infected by FCV inadvertently but rather a non-specific immunofluorescence reaction observed at low serum dilutions. No information is available with respect to the correlation between the antibody titres found in our cats and protection against field virus infection. The observation that the combined vaccines in group 1 induced antibody titres similar or even higher than those of cats in groups 2 and 3, respectively, suggests that a similar degree of protection under field conditions can be expected.",

However, the in vitro compatibility study showed that the viability of the four live components of the multivalent vaccine was not impaired when combined with the FeLV vaccine. Interestingly, in vivo, antibody titres to FPV were somewhat reduced in group 1 on two occasions (days 27 and 48). No explanation can be offered for this observation; it is well known that parvoviruses are extremely resistant to detergents and that it is difficult to imagine that the adjuvants that did not alter the viability of the FCV and FHV-1 should have partially inactivated the parvoviruses. The antibody titres against FeLV were similar in cats receiving combined and single vaccine regimens, respectively. The observation that cats of groups 1 and 3 showed identical antibody kinetics and titres against FeLV is not surprising as in both groups the nature and amount of adjuvants were identical. The cats produced antibodies against all vaccine antigens. Although this seroconversion is no proof that the viruses did in fact replicate, replication must be postulated for the three MLV components. If the FCV, FHV-1 and FPV had been inactivated, the titres would have undoubtedly been much lower as the antigenic mass of these viruses probably were too small for antibody induction.",

            "text": "Protection against intracellular bacteria such as C. felis is mediated by macrophage activation and cytotoxic T cells, i.e., cell-mediated immunity. It has previously been observed that only vaccines containing live organisms are able to induce a protective immunity against intracellular bacteria [28] . In the PBMC cultures, the T lymphocytes were stimulated to produce IL-2 and IL-4 particularly in group 1 while IFN\u2425 expression was equal in all groups, independent of the mode of stimulation. Interestingly, the increase of IL-4 expression in the lymphocytes of group 1 observed after C. felis-stimulation was paralleled by an increased IL-4 expression in unstimulated lymphocytes. When a ratio of IL-2 and IL-4 expression in lymphocytes with C. felis-stimulation and no stimulation was made in order to eliminate the influence of in vivo T cell stimulation, no difference between the groups in the degree of IL-2 and IL-4 expression after C. felis-stimulation was found. This observation suggests that lymphocytes of cats of group 1 had already been stimulated in vivo possibly due to the combination of the MLV components with the adjuvant of the FeLV vaccine. This adjuvant contains QS-21, an immunomodulator fraction of adjuvant Quil A which has been shown to enhance significantly both antibody (Th1) and cell-mediated (Th2) immune responses [29] [30] [31] . The aluminium hydroxide adjuvant promotes primarily a humoral, Th2 biased immune response. Interestingly, lymphocytes of group 3 cats stimulated with C. felis expressed significantly higher IL-2 levels than unstimulated lymphocytes which also suggests that the adjuvants of the FeLV vaccine had induced an in vivo activation of lymphocytes to readily induce IL-2 but not IL-4.",
