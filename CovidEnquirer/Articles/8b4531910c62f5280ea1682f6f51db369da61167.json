IBV is the etiological agent of infectious bronchitis (IB), which is an acute and highly contagious respiratory and urogenital viral disease that affects domestic fowl (Gallus gallus) worldwide (Cavanagh, 2007) , leading to important economic losses related to mortality, severe egg drop, and poor egg quality. IBV belongs to subgenus Igacovirus of genus Gammacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae, and its genome consists of a single positive sense RNA strand approximately 27.6 kb in length that encodes four structural proteins: 1) spike (S) glycoprotein; 2) membrane (M); 3) envelop (E); and 4) nucleocapsid (N), in addition to an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and at least four accessory proteins (3a, 3b, 5a, and 5b) (Boursnell et al., 1987) . The S protein is cleaved into the S1 and S2 subunits consisting of approximately 535 and 625 amino acids, respectively; of these, the S1 subunit is important in viral adsorption to the cellular receptor and viral entry into the host cell, as well as inducing neutralizing antibodies (Boursnell et al., 1987; Cavanagh, 2007) .",

The genetic alterations found in the S1 gene and the corresponding protein of the IBV variants involved in the field outbreaks may be able to change the antigenicity, tissue tropism, and pathogenicity of these viruses when they infect birds (Cavanagh, 2007; Toro et al., 2012) . These genetic changes may also influence the effectiveness of the host immune response against these viruses and favor viral persistence.",

            "text": "Historically, the IBV Massachusetts and Connecticut serotypes were the first isolates discovered in the 1930s and 1950s, respectively (Schalk and Hawn, 1931; Jungherr et al., 1956 ). Subsequently, a number of serotypes/genotypes and other variants have been identified and associated with disease outbreaks around the world (Cook et al., 2012; De Wit et al., 2011) . The classification of IBV genetic types have been primarily performed without universal criteria regarding the nomenclature, methods used to compare the viral molecular data, and the precise genetic region that is to be analyzed. Consequently, groups of genetically-related viruses have been assigned as a new genotype and > 50 genotypes have been reported (De Wit et al., 2011) . Recently, a more definitive phylogeny-based classification system has been used and six genotypes which included 32 lineages were originally distinguished by Valastro et al. (2016) . Next new lineages GI-28 and GI-29 of GI genotype and even one new genotype (GVII) were recently added Jiang et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2019) . This system provides reliable reference sequences and lineage prototypes to guide viral classification. Based on the criteria used in this classification system, at least 16 lineages of IBV strains, including the GI-1 (Mass) (Liu et al., 2006) , GI-3 (Valastro et al., 2016) , GI-4 (Valastro et al., 2016) , GI-5 (Valastro et al., 2016) , GI-6 (Valastro et al., 2016) , GI-7 (TW I and TW II) (Ma et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2016) , GI-9 (Ark) , GI-13 (793/B, CR88, 4/91 or 1/96) (Han et al., 2011) , GI-16 (ck/CH/LDL/97I or Q1) (Liu et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2001) , GI-18 (Valastro et al., 2016) , GI-19 (LX4 or QX) , GI-22 (ck/CH/LSC/99I) (Liu et al., 2006) , GI-28 , GI-29 , GVI-1 (TC07-2) (Li et al., 2010) , and GVII-1 (Ma et al., 2019) , as well as a number of recombinants have been isolated in China . Although the majority of such variants cause only transitory problems, which subsequently resolve or remain confined within a specific geographical region, there are some variants that are able to persist and spread to new regions where they continue to cause disease (de Wit et al., 2011) . IBV GVI-1 represents a genetically distinct lineage present in Asia (Valastro et al., 2016) . Strains of the GVI-1 lineage (also known as the TC07-2 type in China) were believed to be first isolated and identified in Guangxi province in China in 2007 during an outbreak of respiratory disease and were designated as the Chinese New-Type (Li et al., 2010) . Later, viruses closely related to this lineage were also isolated in the Republic of Korea in 2009, which were originally grouped in the 'Korean New Cluster II' (Lim et al., 2012) , and in Japan in 2009 which were assigned to a group termed, JP-IV (Mase et al., 2010) , by partial sequencing of the S1 gene. To date, because no sequences of JP-IV-like S1 are available, it cannot be determined whether the so-called \"JP-IV strains\" are included in GVI-1 or if they cluster into a separate lineage (Valastro et al., 2016) . Moreover, primary pathogenicity results have revealed these strains to be of respiratory nature (Li et al., 2010; Lim et al., 2012) . Recently, a GVI-1 lineage virus, KrD1515, isolated in 2015 in the Republic of Korea, was found to be a Chinese TC07-2 IBV and a non-TC07-2 Korean IBV recombinant virus that engages in respiratory tropism in chickens (Jang et al., 2018) . Although originally isolated 10 years ago, the origin of the GVI-1 viruses was unknown partially because no data currently exists regarding the analysis of complete genomic sequences of this lineage.",

The primers previously used for amplifying the IBV genome (Liu et al., 2013) were used in this study to amplify the entire genomes of the IBV GVI-1 lineage. The reaction program was as follows: reverse transcription at 50\u00b0C for 30 min, 95\u00b0C for 2 min; 30 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0C-65\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 1 min; followed by 72\u00b0C for 10 min. The 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of the viral genomes were confirmed by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using a 3\u2032/5' RACE kit (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) as previously described (Liu et al., 2013) . Each of the resulting PCR products representing the different fragments was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and a QIA quick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California, USA), and was sequenced directly or cloned into a pMD 18-T vector (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). Sanger sequencing was performed (Big Dye Terminator) and 3-5 clones of each PCR product were sequenced to determine a consensus sequence for any given genomic region. Open reading frame (ORF) predictions were carried out using the ORF-finder program (https://www.ncbi.nim.nih.gov/ orffinder/), and the ORFs were compared with that of the GVI-1 virus, CK/CH/SD09/005.",

Trachea and kidney samples were collected and used for viral titration and detection of the IBV antigen by immunohistopathology (IHC) , respectively. The remaining birds in each group were investigated for another 20 days and the morbidity and mortality were recorded. The blood samples were collected at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 dpi from the remaining chickens in each group. IBV-specific IgG in the sera was detected using a commercial IBV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (IDEXX Lab. Inc., Westbrook, Maine, USA) following the manufacture's protocol.",

A deep molecular investigation of the GVI-1 viruses isolated in different parts of the world has led to speculation regarding the origin of this lineage, as two IBV isolates (CO8089L and CO8091L) were detected in Colombia in 2003 (Alvarado et al., 2005) . Moreover, this discovery was made 4 years before TC07-2 was isolated and was found to be closely related to the sequences of GVI-1 viruses isolated in other countries, suggesting that strains CO8089L and CO8091L may be ancestors of the GVI-1 lineage. Despite the fact that only a small part of the S1 gene is currently available for the CO8089L and CO8091L strains, the sequence analysis of the S1 gene fragment alone was not sufficient to confirm or deny this hypothesis. This finding was very similar to the case of the GI-16 lineage (ck/CH/LDL/97I or Q1 genotype), which was believed to have originated in China in 1996, after which it subsequently spread worldwide (Valastro et al., 2016) . However, recent studies have revealed a close relationship between the sequences of the GI-16 lineage and IBV strain 624I that had circulated in Italy in the early 1990s (Laconi et al., 2019) . Further studies have demonstrated that after its emergence at the beginning of the XX century, GI-16 was able to persist until today in Italy (Franzo et al., 2018) . In the late 1980s, GI-16 migrated to Asia, which became the primary nucleus for further spread to the Middle East, Europe, African countries, and especially South America, likely through multiple introduction events (Franzo et al., 2018) . For the GVI-1 lineage, further studies that monitor, isolate, and sequence more complete genomes of the GVI-1 strains from different countries may provide insight into the origin and evolution of the GVI-1 viruses. However, irrespective of where and when it originated, the GVI-1 lineage has spread worldwide (detected in at least five countries including Colombia, China, Korea, Japan, and Vietnam).",

In contrast, recombination may occur in separate events between unidentified viruses and different GI-19 strains with variable genomic sequences. It is important to note that the potential parent, an IBV strain of GI-19 lineage, represented the most prevalent lineage, believed to have initially originated in China, and has not been detected in Colombia to date (Cook et al., 2012) .

These results suggested that the recombination events of the GVI-1 viruses in China and Korea occurred independently. Therefore, we can predict that the CO8089L/CO8091L-like strains were independently introduced from Colombia to China and Korea, and they were most likely the common parental viruses of the GVI-1 viruses isolated from both countries. Whether this is also the case for the emergence and evolution of GVI-1 viruses in other Asian countries requires further confirmation. This hypothesis can be confirmed by the availability and analysis of the complete genomic sequences of the CO8089L/CO8091Llike strains in Colombia and GVI-1 viruses in Asian countries. Increasing evidence shows that the circulation of many \"novel\" genotypes and lineages often predate their first identification (Franzo et al., 2017 (Franzo et al., , 2018 . This is likely also the case of the GVI-1 lineage. Thus, we speculate that some of the so called \"emerging\" genotypes may actually be ancient genetic groups that have not been correctly identified or classified (Franzo et al., 2018) . Based on the VN results, strains LHB/110615 and I0221/17 were found to be of the same serotype and shared 94.9% antigenic relatedness; however, despite the comparative sequence conservation of the S1 subunit for the GVI-1 viruses in this study, obvious antigenic diversity was also found. This has also been reported in other viruses which were found to belong to the same lineage but displayed different antigenicity (Gelb Jr et al., 1997; Lin et al., 2016; Nix et al., 2000) . As the main antigenic viral protein containing epitopes for neutralization (Cavanagh and Davis, 1986; Cavanagh et al., 1986b Cavanagh et al., , 1986c Kant et al., 1992; Koch et al., 1990) , only a few changes in the amino acid composition in the S1 portion of the virus spike protein, especially within the hypervariable regions, may contribute to the altered antigenicity of the viruses (Cavanagh et al., 1992) ; however, the precise locations of these changes are difficult to access. In the present study, because amino acid substitutions were observed in the S1 subunits of the GVI-1 viruses at both the HVRs and sequences encoding the neutralizing epitopes, these substitutions may account for such antigenic changes.",

            "text": "Despite the different sites of recombination in the genomes of the IBV strains that have been reported, the recombination events that occurred in the IBV gene encoding the spike protein may potentially cause antigenic, pathogenic, and tissue tropism changes, possibly even a host shift event, which could lead to the emergence of a novel IBV genotype or avian coronaviruses. It has been proposed that the emergence of coronaviruses in turkeys (Hughes, 2011; Jackwood et al., 2010) and guinea fowl (Brown et al., 2016) resulted from recombination events involving IBVs and an unidentified coronavirus that donated a spike gene that encoded a protein of low amino acid identity to those of IBVs. These recombinations have resulted in a host shift from chickens to turkeys and guinea fowl, respectively. For turkey coronaviruses, such recombination has also resulted in an altered tissue tropism of the virus from the upper respiratory tract to the intestine. Recently, a novel genotype (GVII-1) (Ma et al., 2019) and lineages (GI-28 and GI-29) Jiang et al., 2017) of IBVs have been found to have emerged in China, which were derived from recombination events that led to the replacement of the complete spike gene between IBVs. In some cases, recombination events have resulted in changes in tissue tropism from nephropathogenicity to an affinity for the respiratory tract of chickens (Ma et al., 2019) , compared to the deduced parental virus. This was also the case for viruses of the GVI-1 lineage, which displayed respiratory tropism in chickens in this study and for virus isolated in the Republic of Korea (Jang et al., 2018) ; however, the deduced parental viruses exhibited obvious nephropathogenesis in chickens (Ma et al., 2019) . Interestingly, the commercial broilers where the CO8089L and CO8091L strains were isolated only exhibited the presence of respiratory disease (Alvarado et al., 2005) . In China, nephropathogenic IBV strains (Chen et serotypes have been reported to represent the predominant health problems affecting poultry. However, the wide prevalence of recombinant GVI-1 viruses which display an affinity for the respiratory tract complicated the epidemiology of IBV in China.",
