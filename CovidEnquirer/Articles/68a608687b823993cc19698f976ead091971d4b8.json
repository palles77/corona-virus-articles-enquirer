Bacteria have traditionally been viewed as the dominant pathogens in severe LRTIs. Indeed, rates of Streptococcus pneumoniae infection in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) frequently approached 50% in historical studies. [9] [10] [11] Several factors have altered this paradigm. Introduction of a seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for children in 2000, followed by a 13-valent conjugate vaccine in 2010, markedly reduced rates of severe pneumococcal infection, even in adults. 12, 13 Declining rates of cigarette smoking, one of the greatest risk factors for pneumococcal infection in immunocompetent adults, further reduced the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease. 14 Finally, an aging population has resulted in an ever-increasing number of individuals particularly susceptible to severe viral infection. The elderly are up to 10 times more likely to develop viral pneumonia than younger adults, and they experience substantially higher morbidity and mortality with viral infection. 5, 15, 16 Illustrative of these trends, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Etiology of Pneumonia in the Community (EPIC) study, a population-based surveillance study in which the etiology of CAP was rigorously investigated in 2,259 adult patients, detected a bacterial pathogen in < 15% of patients, and only 5% were infected with S pneumoniae. 5",

            "text": "This change in LRTI epidemiology has been accompanied by marked improvements in the ability to detect respiratory viral pathogens in clinical practice. Slow and labor-intensive culture-based techniques have been largely replaced by increasingly sensitive diagnostic systems that pair nucleic acid amplification with multiplex technology, allowing multiple viruses to be tested on a single sample (discussed later in more detail). A number of studies have leveraged these advanced diagnostic techniques to better characterize the prevalence of viral infection in patients hospitalized with LRTI. In the CDC EPIC study, 23% of patients had evidence of a viral infection. 5 Rhinovirus was the most frequently identified pathogen overall, found in 9% of patients. These results mirror findings of a meta-analysis that reported a combined incidence of respiratory viruses in hospitalized patients with CAP of 23%. 17 Viruses seem to be just as common in patients admitted to the ICU (Fig 1) . In a South Korean study of 198 patients with pneumonia admitted to the ICU, > 35% had a viral pathogen identified (of which 24% were rhinovirus). 18 Other studies in ICU patients have reported viral infection rates between 18% and 41%. [19] [20] [21] Recognition that viral pathogens are common causes of severe LRTI comes at a time when innovative approaches to curb antimicrobial use are urgently needed. Antibiotic overuse is a major driver of antimicrobial resistance. 22 Rates of infection with drug-resistant pathogens frequently exceed 25% in severe hospital-acquired pneumonia, raising concern that whole classes of antibiotics may soon prove obsolete. 23, 24 Respiratory viral testing offers a potential way forward. If severe LRTI is increasingly a viral illness, then perhaps leveraging improved diagnostic tools can rapidly identify a large number of patients in whom antibiotics are unnecessary.",

High heat (z 95 C) is initially used to separate the double-stranded DNA.

In a multicenter trial in the Netherlands, 107 newly admitted patients receiving antibiotics for an LRTI were randomized to receive standard care or viral testing according to multiplex PCR. 56 Although the use of PCR doubled the number of patients with an identified pathogen, it increased hospital costs without reducing antibiotic use, diagnostic procedures, or duration of hospital stay. Branche et al 57 randomized 300 patients admitted with an LRTI to receive either standard care (which included the use of an influenza/RSV duplex PCR) or measurement of procalcitonin (PCT) paired with testing of throat and nasal swabs for 14 viruses by using multiplex PCR. Initiation of antimicrobial therapy was discouraged for PCT values # 0.24 ng/mL. Sixty-three of 151 patients (42%) in the intervention arm had a positive PCR, whereas 64 of 149 patients (40%) in the control arm had a positive viral test result. Although no difference in overall antibiotic use between the two arms was found, the subgroup of patients with a low PCT and a positive viral PCR were less likely to receive antibiotics at discharge (25% vs 45%; P \u00bc .002).",

Patients in the control arm underwent standard diagnostic testing, including optional use of a laboratory-based PCR test for five respiratory viruses. Patients in the intervention arm had nasal and throat swabs tested on a multiplex PCR platform located in each unit. A total of 161 of 360 patients (45%) in the intervention arm had a virus detected, with influenza (17%) and rhinovirus/ enterovirus (15%) being the most common pathogens identified. Only 158 of 354 patients (45%) in the control arm underwent PCR testing, with 52 (15%) of those patients found to have a viral infection. Turnaround time was significantly faster in the intervention arm (2 vs 37 h; P < .0001).

In addition, testing should be implemented as part of a multidisciplinary and longitudinal antimicrobial stewardship program, as has been reported in small studies to be beneficial. 64 We find it helpful to pair respiratory viral testing with measurement of PCT, a biomarker that has been shown to reduce antibiotic administration in patients presenting with respiratory infection. 65 Even in patients requiring admission to the ICU, we will routinely discontinue antibiotic therapy if the PCT is low and a viral pathogen has been identified, especially if testing is performed on a sample collected from the lower respiratory tract. The pathogenicity of non-influenza viruses remains a source of debate. Rhinovirus is probably the most cited example. Rhinovirus clearly causes pneumonia in children with viremia, and detection in pleural fluid supports its pathogenicity. The data in adults are less established but, in our view, compelling evidence suggests that these viruses can indeed cause severe disease. 5, 18, [66] [67] [68] Initiation of specific antiviral therapy for influenza or adenovirus in critically ill patients or discontinuation of empirical anti-influenza treatment during peak season can also be guided by using multiplex viral detection. Emerging specific treatment options for RSV and other viruses will further influence the clinical benefit of respiratory viral testing.",

As such, a critical moment to reduce antibiotic administration was missed in a large number of patients. Although difficult to measure, the clinical momentum associated with antibiotic initiation in acutely ill patients likely contributes to ongoing antibiotic exposure even if viral test results are positive.Fourth, heterogeneity in study populations makes generalizability challenging. Broad terms such as LRTI and acute respiratory infection capture different patient populations depending on the season and study center. Whether lessons learned from viral testing in patients presenting with a flu-like illness during peak influenza season are applicable to patients admitted with CAP is unclear.Most importantly, the expectation that a single laboratory test in isolation will dramatically affect clinical care may be unrealistic. This concept is particularly true for multiplex viral detection when specific antiviral treatment is available for only a few detectable viral pathogens. The decision to administer antibiotics to patients with severe LRTI depends on numerous factors, including a clinician's pretest suspicion for bacterial infection, the results of diagnostic testing (eg, studies have found an abnormal chest radiograph to be associated with continued antibiotic use54,56,60 ), and a patient's clinical course. As noted earlier, the clinical significance of a positive or negative respiratory viral test result is often unclear, and thus it is understandable and perhaps advisable for clinicians not to use the results of testing as the sole determinant of antibiotic administration. Studies in other settings have shown that overreliance on antibiotics persists despite clear recommendations from consensus guidelines",
