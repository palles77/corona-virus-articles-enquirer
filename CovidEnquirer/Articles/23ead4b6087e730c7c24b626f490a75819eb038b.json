            "text": "In the 19th century, before the antimicrobial era, pneumonia was described by Sir William Osler as a fatal disease in older adults. Mortality rates are still high, particularly in elderly patients. Pneumonia, together with influenza, is the eighth leading cause of death in the United States and accounts for 2.3% of all death cases in patients older than 65 years. 1 Risk factors for pneumonia among older adults include underlying comorbid conditions, such as cardiovascular and lung disease, diabetes mellitus, and malignancy, all of which are more prevalent in advanced age. Male gender and smoking have been identified as independent risk factors for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in older adults, [2] [3] [4] as has reduced functional capacity, and residence in an institution (long-term care facility [LTCF] or nursing home). [5] [6] [7] Polypharmacy is a common finding in older patients, and several drugs are associated with higher risk of pneumonia, including antipsychotic and anticholinergic drugs, both used to treat symptoms that are more common in elderly patients. These drugs are used to treat dementia symptoms, urinary incontinence, depression, pain, and insomnia. 8 Some of the anticholinergic side effects include sedation and altered mental status, which increase the risk of pneumonia, and can also be symptoms of pneumonia. 9 In addition, inhaled corticosteroids have been associated with recurrent pneumonia. 10 The burden of pneumonia on health care resources is enormous owing to both hospitalization costs and long-term outcomes, particularly in elderly patients. 11 With the anticipated growth of the population of older adults, the burden of pneumonia, both community acquired and health care associated, is anticipated to increase. 11, 12 PATHOGENESIS: WHAT MAKES ELDERLY PATIENTS PRONE TO DEVELOPING PNEUMONIA?",

            "text": "Structural and functional changes across the respiratory system lead to reduced host defenses. These factors include (1) impaired function of mucociliary clearance, an important defense mechanism against pathogen entrance to the upper airways and respiratory tree. Slower and less efficient clearance of secretions by the mucociliary system in the elderly has been shown to correlate with pneumonia. 13 (2) Chest wall mobility and compliance decrease with aging owing to costovertebral joint alteration, rib cartilage calcification, loss of muscle strength, and changes in the shape of rib cage such as kyphosis or scoliosis. (3) Lung compliance is reduced owing to changes in lung parenchyma, which affect the lung's elastic recoil. 6 These alterations in the chest wall and lung compliance lead to increased air trapping, reduced ability to clear secretions, and an increase in the workload of respiratory muscles. In older age, a further increase in the work of breathing, as occurs in cases of pneumonia and particularly in the presence of underlying diseases such as cardiovascular and lung diseases, compromise functionality during infection and may lead to respiratory failure. 14 Neurologic changes predisposing older adults to \"silent aspiration\" include reduced ability to cough owing to gag reflex dysfunction as well as changes in mental status. 15 In one study, oropharyngeal dysphagia was strongly associated with CAP in the elderly (occurring in 91% of patients with CAP; odds ratio, 16.3; 95% CI, 4.6-58.2). 16 In addition, pneumonia has been estimated to occur in about 10% to 30% of patients after a stroke. 17, 18 In a study that followed patients older than 65 years with infarcts, patients with bilateral basal ganglia infarcts had the highest incidence of pneumonia compared with those with no infarct or less extensive lesions. 19 The response to infection is altered in the elderly owing to lower sensitivity of the respiratory centers to hypoxia and hypercapnia. Altered mentation and absence of cough or appropriate ventilator response also modify clinical presentation in the elderly, delay diagnosis and treatment, and consequently impact clinical outcomes. 20, 21 The increased frequency of respiratory tract colonization in older adults [22] [23] [24] leads to an increased likelihood of chemical aspiration developing into aspiration pneumonia. 25 The alterations in the immune system that occur with aging are not well-defined. Several animal and human observations have demonstrated immune dysregulation in both innate and adaptive immune components. 26 However, some studies demonstrate prolonged low-grade inflammation, and some levels of proinflammatory cytokines are higher in patients older than 70 years compared with patients younger than 60 years. [27] [28] [29] Some authors propose that low-grade inflammation, called \"inflammaging\" may contribute to blunted immune response to respiratory tract infection. 21, 30 Further research is needed to understand the magnitude and the role of alterations in the immune system associated with pneumonia in elderly patients.",

            "text": "Patients who acquire pneumonia in an LTCF often have multiple comorbid diseases (eg, cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurologic) and poor functional status. In addition, risk factors for aspiration among LTCF residents (eg, nasogastric feeding, difficulty swallowing, receiving sedative agents, and poor functional status) increase risk for the development of pneumonia. [52] [53] [54] MICROBIOLOGY In general, despite technological diagnostic improvements, the causative pathogen is not identified in nearly one-half of pneumonia episodes across all ages, 32, 55 and in up to 77% of pneumonia episodes that occur in elderly patients. 56 Cough reflex dysfunction and altered mentation often preclude the availability of sputum, and only 30% to 40% of patients are able to provide sputum for analysis. 6, 44 In addition, elderly patients tend to receive antibiotic treatment before attempts at diagnostic procedures, particularly in persons residing in LTCFs. 57 Common Causes of Pneumonia Among Elderly Patients in the Community, Including Long-term Care Facilities Streptococcus pneumoniae is by far the most common pathogen detected in CAP, and accounts for 20% to 85% of cases in the elderly. Haemophilus influenza is the second most common detected pathogen (2.9%-29.4%), 6,56,58 followed by respiratory viruses, in particular influenza, coronavirus, and rhinovirus ( Table 1) . 46, 56 Legionella is detected in 1.0% to 17.5% 57-59 of cases and in some studies is considered to be the second or third commonest cause of pneumonia in the elderly, particularly in cases of severe CAP. 60 Other atypical organisms (including Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia spp) are infrequently identified in adults aged over 65 years. 6, 42 Coinfection with bacterial and viral pathogens has been reported in 3% to 40% of cases of CAP, 4,44 and detection of coinfection has increased with the use of improved diagnostic tests. Bacterial coinfection complicates approximately 2.5% of influenza cases in older patients and those with comorbid conditions. In the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, bacterial coinfection complicated 18% to 34% of intensive care unit (ICU) cases, and more than one-half of the fatal cases. 61 In 6 studies that evaluated pneumonia among LTCF residents, S pneumoniae (12.9%) was identified as the most common cause of pneumonia, followed by H influenza (6.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (6.4%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (4.4%). Enteric Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 4.2% to 14.3% of cases. 51 The role of atypical Gram-negative bacilli are detected in 2.8% to 14.0% of CAP cases, and may colonize the respiratory tract of elderly patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia, 63 particularly those admitted to the hospital from LTCFs. 50, 58 Among LTCF patients with severe aspiration pneumonia, enteric Gram-negative bacilli were detected as the predominant cause in 49% of cases. 64 In the Competence Network for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAPNETZ) study, predictors of CAP owing to Enterobacteriaceae included age greater than 65 years, heart failure and cerebrovascular disease. 65 Pseudomonas aeruginosa was reported in 2.0% to 17.1% of patients, and was associated with impaired swallowing, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis, severe disease, admission from nursing homes, and presence of a feeding tube. 36, 60, 63, 65, 66 Although there are no data that support empiric anti-Pseudomonas treatment in elderly patients, this pathogen should be considered in severe infection in the presence of structural lung disease and known prior colonization.",

Although MRSA is an important cause of pneumonia in elderly, particularly among LTCF residents, community-acquired MRSA has not been reported to be a significant cause of pneumonia in elderly patients. 74 Risk factors for community-acquired pneumonia owing to multidrug-resistant organisms Several scores were developed in the past decade to evaluate patients who are at risk for CAP owing to MDROs. Table 1 shows risk factors associated with CAP owing to MDRO. 72, 75, 76 No consensus exists as to which is the most reliable combination of risk factors predicting the likelihood of patients hospitalized for CAP owing to MDROs. Brito and Niederman 77 reviewed several studies that evaluated patients with HCAP and proposed an algorithm that combined severity of illness and number of risk factors. In general, most of the studies included patients who were recently hospitalized, or arrived from LTCFs with severe CAP (ie, were admitted to the ICU). The most common resistant pathogens described in these studies were MRSA and P aeruginosa, as well as other gram-negative bacilli. Risk factors included in this algorithm were recent antibiotic therapy in the past 6 months, recent hospitalization in the past 3 months, the presence of immune suppression, and poor functional status as defined by inability to perform activities of daily living. 77 According to the authors, patients with severe CAP and 1 risk factor should receive empiric broad spectrum antibiotic treatment, whereas patients who have nonsevere CAP needed to have 2 or more risk factors before broad spectrum therapy would be indicated. This algorithm might be useful as a supplement to clinical judgment when managing patients with pneumonia.",

            "text": "Pneumonia in elderly patients was described by William Osler as a painless and fatal disease. The disease was described as latent, without chills, with mild cough, and sometimes without sputum. Physical examination was marked owing to the lack of classic evidence of consolidation, and mental status changes might be the only signs of pneumonia. 25 Not much has changed in our knowledge regarding pneumonia manifestations in the elderly. Fever may be absent in 25% to 55% of pneumonia cases in older adults, 20,25,78 and a similar proportion of elderly patients present with altered mental status. 57 Of 48 patients older than 65 years in a veteran's administration medical center who were diagnosed with pneumonia based on new pulmonary infiltrates and symptoms, only 35% presented with fever and cough. The absence of classic symptoms was more common in patients with reduced baseline functional capacity. 79 A study that evaluated 1812 patients from 4 US hospitals demonstrated that, as patients became older, the number of reported symptoms of pneumonia decreased. 20 Among patients who reside in LTCFs, pneumonia-related signs and symptoms were demonstrated to be subtler than in CAP patients from the same age group. 80 As many as 73% of these LTCF cases present with confusion. Fever and respiratory symptoms were less common than in other CAP patients. 49 In residents of LTCFs, diagnosis of pneumonia based on symptoms and physical examination has low sensitivity and specificity (47%-69% and 58%-75%, respectively). 51 In addition, owing to the presence of other comorbid conditions, there is often a broad and nonspecific differential diagnosis, which can lead to diagnostic challenges and delays. An association between latent pneumonia and poor outcomes was described by Osler William, who stressed that fever may actually be a positive predictor of outcome, a notion that was later supported by other researchers. [81] [82] [83] [84] The diagnosis of pneumonia in the elderly depends on a high index of suspicion and should be considered in the presence of one of the following atypical signs and symptoms: confusion, delirium, disorientation, 25 or loss of appetite. Particularly in an older adult with dementia, urinary incontinence may sometimes be an early indicator of debility caused by pneumonia. 79 These atypical symptoms should not be automatically attributed to a patient's baseline dementia. 81, 85 Unexplained deterioration in general health, weakness, new onset of recurrent falls, and functional decline (ie, general deterioration) may also be important manifestations of pneumonia in older adults, as well as exacerbation of underlying illnesses, such as congestive heart failure, chronic pulmonary lung disease, and impaired diabetic control. 25 Simple physical examination findings, including respiratory rate (>25 breathes per minute) and pulse oximetry (oxygen saturation <90%) have a high sensitivity for pneumonia and, if present, indicate the need for further evaluation of pneumonia, potentially including imaging, testing, and referral to an acute care hospital. 86, 87 In 1 study of LTFC subjects with pneumonia, an oxygen saturation of less than 94% was sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of pneumonia (80% and 91%, respectively). 88 Imaging Evaluating imaging findings in elderly persons with suspected pneumonia is challenging. The classic pulmonary opacity used as part of the gold standard for diagnosis of pneumonia may not be identified by a regular chest radiograph owing to poor film quality. Poor quality might be owing in part to the patient's poor cognitive status, poor muscle strength, and inability to maintain posture. 86 In addition, lung disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancies, interstitial lung disease) and chest wall abnormalities, which are more frequent in the elderly, may complicate the interpretation of chest radiographs. In several studies of elderly patients, computed tomography (CT) scan detected pneumonia in up to 47% of cases that were not identified by using chest radiographs. 89, 90 There are also interobserver discrepancies in the interpretation of chest radiographs, which may be particularly problematic when portable chest radiographs are used. 91 Among residents of LTCFs, imaging has an important role in the diagnosis of pneumonia, as well as in identifying other high-risk conditions that warrant the transfer to an acute care facility. Often, LTCFs have contracted services that provide portable chest radiographs; these portable chest radiographs have similar limitations to standard chest radiographs, as described. Further complicating the usefulness of chest radiographs in LTCFs is a lack of previous films for comparison. 86 Nevertheless, several studies have reported that 75% to 90% of chest radiographs taken for evaluation of suspected pneumonia among LTCF residents showed evidence of pneumonia. Thus, chest radiograph should be conducted as part of the evaluation of pneumonia in LTCF residents. 86, 92 Although CT scan is the gold standard for diagnosis of pneumonia, limitations such as cost, radiation exposure, availability, and identification of incidental findings, which are particularly common in the elderly, 93 limit its usefulness. Chest CT should be limited to cases where chest radiograph findings are inconclusive, pneumonia complications might be present (eg, lung abscess), or when there is suspicion for pathologies that cannot be diagnosed by chest radiograph (eg, pulmonary embolism, tumor, etc).",

Several studies of elderly patients who were diagnosed with pneumonia reported that the absence of leukocytosis, as well as leukopenia, was associated with increased mortality (29% vs 4% in patients without vs patients with leukocytosis). 83, 98 Among patients who reside in LTCFs, neutrophil percentage of greater than 90% and left shift (neutrophil band percentage of >6%) were associated with high likelihood of bacterial infection. 86 Recently, extensive discussion occurred pertaining to the value of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) in discriminating bacterial pneumonia from other inflammatory and infectious processes. The usefulness of PCT in differentiating bacterial pneumonia from other acute illnesses in the real world is controversial. 99, 100 In addition, the role of PCT in elderly persons is unclear, because this population group is usually excluded from clinical studies. A recent retrospective study in Italy evaluated the role of CRP in elderly patients who presented to the emergency department with respiratory symptoms and were discharged with or without a final diagnosis of pneumonia. This study reported an association between high CRP levels and pneumonia, even after adjusting for confounders, with a cutoff of 61 mg/L providing the best sensitivity and specificity (odds ratio, 3.59; 95% CI, 2. 35-5.48 ). In the same study, PCT levels were not significantly associated with pneumonia. 90 The use of CRP and PCT was evaluated for severity of pneumonia in elderly patients, and was not found to predict mortality. 101, 102 Low serum albumin levels are associated with poor prognosis in CAP patients. 103 In 1 study that compared clinical manifestations of pneumonia among CAP patients and LTCF residents, the albumin level was much lower among LTCF residents with pneumonia than in non-LTCF CAP patients. 104 In another study, low serum albumin levels and lymphocytes (both of which represent poor nutritional status) were associated with mortality. 80 ",

These types of patients include high-risk patients, with either severe pneumonia, or who have multiple comorbid conditions. 32 In patients who are ill enough to be hospitalized with severe pneumonia, 2 sets of blood cultures should be obtained, in addition to sputum cultures and urinary antigen tests for Streptococcus pneumonia and Legionella pneumophila. ICU patients with severe pneumonia often require more extensive evaluation, including bronchoalveolar lavage for microbiologic diagnosis of viruses and bacterial pathogens. These recommendations and clinical guidance are not specific for elderly patients. Clinical judgment should be used to consider the yield of a particular test and the impact of its results on clinical management. Among LTCF residents, the yield from blood cultures is low when patients are treated in the LTCF. However, when an LTCF resident acquires pneumonia severe enough to be transferred to an acute care facility, blood cultures are recommended. 86 In addition, because of the poor functional capacity of many LTCF residents, sputum examination is often not performed, even when residents are admitted to an acute care facility (<30% of the patients have sputum examined). When sputum is obtained, frequently samples are not adequate for diagnostic evaluation. Thus, sputum sampling is not recommended for initial assessment, except for cases of severe pneumonia. 86, 105 Urine antigen testing may be used to detect S pneumoniae or L pneumophila. Although the prevalence of Legionella pneumonia in LTCF residents is not greater than in other elderly patients (0.0%-6.5%), 86, 104, 106 in outbreak settings, urinary antigen diagnostics might play an important role in diagnosis and infection control. During the appropriate season, rapid antigen and polymerase chain reaction tests for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus are often useful.",

These factors increase the risk of treatment failure, and hence need for hospital admission, and should be part of the clinical decision making regarding need for hospital admission. 21 Admission to the ICU is appropriate in many patients with severe CAP who require high level of care. The Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society guidelines for CAP management from 2007 proposed criteria for severe CAP. Major criteria include mechanical ventilation and septic shock. There are nine minor criteria, including CURB components, as well as hypothermia, PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratio of 250 or less, bilateral or multilobar infiltrates, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. One major criteria or 3 minor criteria indicate the need for ICU admission. In addition, a CURB-65 of greater than 3 may indicate severe pneumonia and the potential need for intensive care. 32 For LTCF residents, most mild to moderate pneumonia can be treated in the LTCF, and the decision to transfer the patient to an acute care facility is based on both clinical assessment, LTCF management availability (chest radiograph availability, intravenous treatment, physician availability), and social considerations. Loeb and colleagues 107 demonstrated that an intervention that included initial assessment of patient eligibility to be treated in the LTCF, followed by early imaging, oral antibiotic treatment, as well as intensive maintenance of hydration and oxygenation in, resulted in reduced hospitalization rate (18% compared with 30% in the usual care group) and costs, and did not impact mortality rates. According to expert panel recommendations from the Infectious Diseases Society of America in 2008, LTCF residents who have suspected pneumonia and an increased respiratory rate (>25/min) as well as hypoxemia (pulse oximetry <90%) should be transferred to the hospital, as should persons with imaging findings that require more intensive management (pleural effusion, heart failure). Residents should also be transferred to an acute care facility when critical diagnostic tests or necessary therapies are not available in the LTCF. In addition to these considerations, when considering site of care for LTCF residents, the patient's desire to be transferred to an acute care facility and intensively treated is another factor to consider. 51, 86 Antibiotic Treatment",

In 1 study that compared 71 hospitalized subjects with pneumonia who were admitted from nursing homes with 93 hospitalized patients with CAP who were admitted from home (median aged, 77 years), the in-hospital mortality rate, as well as the 1-year mortality rate of the hospitalized patients from LTCFs with CAP, was twice the mortality rate CAP patients admitted from home (in-hospital mortality rates of 32% vs 14%, and 1-year mortality rates of 58% vs 33%). 51 Mortality rates are higher for patients who require hospitalization than for patients who are treated in the nursing home (17.6%-53% and 8.8%-28%, respectively). The most important predictor of both in-hospital and long-term mortality in nursing home patients with lower respiratory tract infection is functional status, measured as independence with activities of daily living. 134, 135 A poor activities of daily living score is also more common in patients with recurrent pneumonia, 52 as well as those who require admission to the hospital for diseases other than pneumonia. Functional deterioration may also be a long term consequence of pneumonia in LTCF patients. 136 The costs of pneumonia in nursing home patients were prospectively evaluated in 36 nursing homes in Missouri. The estimated mean total cost per episode treated in the hospital was $10,408, whereas an episode treated in the nursing home cost approximately $3789. 137 ",
