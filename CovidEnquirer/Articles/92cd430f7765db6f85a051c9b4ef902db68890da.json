They are obtained by fractionating plasma collected from immunized horses or, less frequently, sheep. Manufacturing processes usually include pepsin digestion at acid pH, papain digestion, ammonium sulphate precipitation, caprylic acid precipitation, heat coagulation and/or chromatography. Most production processes do not have deliberately introduced viral inactivation or removal treatments, but antivenoms have never been found to transmit viruses to humans. Nevertheless, the recent examples of zoonotic diseases highlight the need to perform a careful assessment of the viral safety of antivenoms. This paper reviews the characteristics of equine viruses of antivenoms and discusses the potential of some manufacturing steps to avoid risks of viral contamination. Analysis of production parameters indicate that acid pH treatments and caprylic acid precipitations, which have been validated for the manufacture of some human IgG products, appear to provide the best potential for viral inactivation of antivenoms. As many manufacturers of antivenoms located in developing countries lack the resources to conduct formal viral validation studies, it is hoped that this review will help in the scientific understanding of the viral safety factors of antivenoms, in the controlled implementation of the manufacturing steps with expected impact on viral safety, and in the overall reinforcement of good manufacturing practices of these essential therapeutic products.",

Viperid snake bite envenoming induces local effects, such as swelling, pain, necrosis, hemorrhage and blistering, often accompanied by secondary infection [9] . Systemic viperid envenoming is characterized by a complex pathophysiological profile including coagulopathy, hemorrhage, hypovolaemia, shock and acute renal failure [9, 11] . Progressive paralysis may be caused by elapid snake venom neurotoxins, and by some viperid venoms displaying neurotoxic effects. Some elapid venoms also induce local necrosis and rhabdomyolysis [9] .

Pooled hyperimmune plasma is processed to purify the horse immunoglobulin G (IgG) fraction that may be subjected to enzymatic treatment to obtain F(ab#) 2 and Fab antibody fragments, and caprylate or ammonium sulphate precipitation to improve their purity [1] . To some extent, some manufacturing steps have features similar to those used to prepare human plasma-derived IgG. Although there is no known transmission of any infectious agent through antivenoms (albeit under circumstances where rigorous clinical patient follow-up is difficult), theoretical concerns about the possibility of transmission of horse/sheep infectious agents to humans do exist. Recent natural transmissions of zoonotic diseases highlight the possible exchanges between humans and the natural reservoirs of biologic agents found in animals [15] , and the inherent risk of emerging diseases [16] . Examples of such infections originating from animal (or avian) pathogens include human immunodeficiency virus, Ebola, Hantaan, Lassa, Nipah viruses and other paramyxoviruses, equine morbilli virus, West Nile virus, and probably severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [17, 18] . The parenteral transmission of animal viruses to humans is also possible. Infectious SV40 virus of rhesus monkeys was a contaminant of early polio vaccines which were administered to a large number of people. Whether this was the way in which this virus was introduced into the human population is unclear and a controversial issue.",

However, most manufacturers of antivenoms are located in the developing world and some of them may not be directly exposed to the state-of-the-art process validation concepts, nor have the financial and logistics capability to perform extensive viral validation studies to assess the viral reduction potential of the process they use. Therefore, we found it helpful to examine the viral safety of antivenoms by first reviewing the characteristics of equine viruses. We then evaluated the theoretical ability of manufacturing methods of antivenoms to inactivate or remove those viruses, through a comparison with the well validated technologies used to manufacture human plasma-derived IgG preparations. Finally, we want to emphasize that applying good manufacturing practices in the production of antivenoms, from the control of the animals to that of all production steps, and ensuring traceability in the whole chain of manufacture, represent the current best investment in the quality and safety of these products.",

After a few weeks to several months incubation, BDV can cause locomotor and sensory dysfunction followed by paralysis and death. BDV exists world-wide in horses, sheep, cattle, cats, dogs and ostriches and can affect a large number of warm-blooded animal species, including humans [24, 25] . The infection can be fatal, but the majority of carriers are asymptomatic [26] . Cross-species transmission of this commensal virus has not been proven, but zoonotic aspects of BDV should be considered [26] . BDV-specific antibodies and viral RNA have been found in humans with various psychiatric disorders. Diagnosis can be made serologically, but also by antigen markers in peripheral white blood cells, combined with nucleic acid amplification [26] .",

It is the reference virus for a proposed new genus within the Paramyxoviridae family, which also includes another newly identified zoonotic bat virus (Nipah), and the Salem virus. HeV has been recognized in Australia as a new zoonotic disease of horses since 1994/1995. This lethal zoonotic viral agent is endemic in certain species of fruit bats (flying-foxes) and over 20% of them in eastern Australia are seropositive [40] . Six species of flying-foxes in Papua New Guinea have tested positive for antibodies to HeV [40] . HeV does not appear to transmit readily between horses under natural and experimental conditions, or from horses to humans [41] . Horses can be infected by oronasal routes and can excrete HeV in urine and saliva [41] . The virus appears to be spread by close contact with body fluids, such as froth from infected lungs [42] , via nasal discharge, saliva and/or urine [43] . The most important clinical and pathological manifestation of HeV infection in horses and humans is severe interstitial pneumonia caused by viral infection of small blood vessels. From 1994 to 1999, epizootic and epidemiological episodes of meningoencephalitis and severe acute respiratory syndromes were reported in Australia, Malaysia and Singapore [15, 44] . It may also cause nervous disease. Three incidents of HeV disease in horses have been recorded in Australiadtwo in 1994, which caused the death of two humans and 15 horses and one in 1999, which involved the death of a single horse [45] . Infected horses can develop a severe and often fatal respiratory disease characterized by dyspnoea, vascular endothelial damage and pulmonary oedema. Nervous signs may also occur. A number of diagnostic methods have been developed [46] , based on the examination of blood, lung, kidney, spleen, and, if nervous signs are present, also of the brain. PCR assays have been developed. A rapid and sensitive RT-PCR assay using a fluorogenic (TaqMan) probe was developed to improve the diagnosis of HeV infection [47] .",

Infected humans may be asymptomatic and the transfusion of donated blood from such individuals has resulted in the infection and death of recipients. This has led to the introduction in 2003 of strict regulatory measures in Canada and the USA which include the testing by a PCR assay of all blood donations. WNV primarily circulates between birds and mosquitoes, while mammalian infections are incidental. Mammal biting mosquitoes become infected when they feed on the blood of an infected bird. Once this happens, people, horses and other mammals may get WNV. Infected horses are, however, unlikely to serve as important amplifying hosts for WNV in nature [55] . Many WNV-infected horses probably never show symptoms, but a study reported mortality rates close to 30% [56] . Early symptoms are often indistinguishable from other equine encephalitides including rabies, equine herpesvirus-1, equine protozoal myeloencephalitis, and eastern, western, or Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis. A vaccine for horses has been developed, but one horse that received two doses died from the disease [56] .",

Plasma from several animals is typically pooled into 20e300 l batches and subjected to a fractionation process to isolate the IgG fraction. Following the initial use of crude equine immune serum, still reported to be manufactured by one producer [5] , various methods of IgG purification and refinement have been introduced ( Table 2 ). Most manufacturers use protocols derived from the basic method described by Pope [61, 62] , modified by Harms [63] , based on pepsin digestion at low pH, to obtain F(ab#) 2 fragments, followed by ammonium sulphate precipitation of antibody fragments [5, 64, 65] . This basic approach is combined with a number of additional steps, aimed at obtaining a purer [66] preparation, such as heat coagulation [64] and ion-exchange chromatography [66, 67] . The pH at which pepsin digestion is performed by various laboratories ranges between 3.1 and 3.8, at temperatures between 30 and 37 C. Pepsin digestion is usually performed in undiluted serum or plasma (protein concentration: 60e90 g/l). Incubation times range from 40 min to 24 h and with varying pepsin concentrations [64, 65, 67, 68] . Thermocoagulation is used by many laboratories and consists of heating at 55e56 C for 1 h [64, 65, 68] although not all methods involving pepsin digestion include heat coagulation [67] . Some fractionation protocols include an additional Table 2 Steps used for the manufacture of antivenoms Screening of production animals for adventitious agents Plasma collection (whole blood or apheresis) in bags or bottles Plasma thawing at room temperature Plasma pooling IgG/fragments purification process F(ab#) 2 : B pepsin digestion (acid pH) and ammonium sulphate precipitation, or B pepsin digestion (acid pH) and caprylic acid precipitation Fab: ammonium sulphate precipitation and papain digestion at pH 7e8 Whole IgG: B caprylic acid precipitation B ammonium sulphate precipitation IgG/fragments concentration: (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 /Na 2 SO 4 precipitation, ultrafiltration Polishing: ion exchange (removes Fc and further purifies IgGs/ fragments) Ultrafiltration Sterile filtration Aseptic filling Storage in the liquid state or lyophilisation acidification step to remove some non-IgG globulins ('euglobulins') which are unstable at acid pHs [66, 69] .

The conditions used for caprylic acid fractionation of equine plasma are as follows: plasma pH is adjusted to 5.8 and caprylic acid is added directly to this plasma to attain a final concentration of 5% (v/v). The mixture is stirred during caprylic acid addition and then for one additional hour, after which the precipitate is separated by filtration. Caprylic acid is then removed by either dialysis or ultrafiltration and the product is formulated before sterile filtration [72] . Some antivenoms are made of Fab antibody fragments, obtained by papain digestion of sheep IgG, at neutral pH, after sodium sulphate precipitation of IgG [73] . Affinity-chromatography or ion-exchange chromatography steps have been described in the production of some Fab antivenoms [74, 75] . Treatment with b-propiolactone has been evaluated to reduce complement activation by horse plasma-derived products [76] ; however, it does not appear to be used routinely in laboratories producing antivenoms.",

Colonies of animals should be kept free of contamination through good husbandry or vaccination, where appropriate. Surveillance of the source animals should include screening for pathogens, health monitoring, including routine blood chemistry and haematology tests, and post-mortem examination. Ideally, animals should be kept under strictly contained conditions, but this is not readily applicable to horses. However, for instance, animals could be kept free of a particular arthropod-borne virus if they are maintained in an area free of the particular arthropod vector. If a particular pathogen is identified, it should be established whether it is present in plasma. Some virological screening methods may be performed, if available and epidemiologically relevant to a particular geographic region, to limit risk of virus presence in the animal herd and/or the plasma pool. To some extent the Guidelines from the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Association (FELASA), although not referring to horses, may serve as a reference [81e83]. Nevertheless, not all of these measures are available in many developing countries nor readily applicable to horses used for antivenom production, and pathogens can escape this surveillance program. This illustrates the need for manufacturing techniques to ensure a sufficient margin of safety with regards to potential infectious agents present in the manufacturing plasma pool. This also strongly emphasizes the crucial importance of ensuring an appropriate traceability system from horse donors to human recipients of antivenoms so that any potential infectious events or risks may be identified in a proper and timely manner and relevant counter-measures taken promptly.",

Purification processes combine cryoprecipitation, ethanol fractionation, chromatography, and ultrafiltration [84] . In addition, various types of dedicated viral reduction treatments have been introduced, most often on purpose, such as chemical treatments by solvent-detergent, caprylic acid precipitation, low-pH incubation, heat treatments in the liquid or in the dry states, and nanofiltration [80] .

It has been suggested that the non-ionized form of the caprylic acid disrupts the integrity of the lipid bilayer and membrane associated proteins of enveloped viruses. Utilizing the dissociation reaction and varying the concentration of the ionized form of caprylate, a specific amount of the nonionized form of caprylate can be maintained over a wide pH range.

The robustness of a treatment applied to three intravenous immunoglobulin preparations (IgG, IgM-enriched, and IgM preparations) has been investigated using HIV, BVDV, Sindbis virus and pseudorabies as model viruses [87] . The routine treatment conditions for these two IgG and this IgM preparation are indicated in Table 3 . Kinetics of inactivation was determined over a period of 1 h of treatment. Complete inactivation (corresponding to more than 4.68e6.25 log) is achieved within the first minutes. Within a certain range, viral inactivation in the IgG product was not affected by pH (5.5e6.0), temperature (0e26 C), and protein content (30e40 g/l). Above pH 6, and most specifically at pH 8, no BVDV inactivation was found. At a content of caprylic acid of 3.7 g/kg or less, inactivation of HIV is significantly reduced. Under the conditions applied during manufacture, caprylic acid leads to robust inactivation of lipid-enveloped viruses; pH is a particularly critical parameter and should be less than 6. These conditions have also been found to inactivate O4.7 log10 EAV, an equine virus used as a model (Dichtelmu\u00a8ller, personal communication). Another study reported the viral inactivation achieved during caprylic acid precipitation of non-IgG proteins from human IgG product [88] . At pH 5.1, 23 C, and in the presence of 9 mM caprylate, R 4.7 and R 4.2 log of HIV and PRV, respectively, were inactivated during the 1 h treatment, but only 1.5 log for BVDV was inactivated. At 12 mM caprylate, R 4.4 log of BVDV was inactivated within this time period. At pH 5.1, 24 C, 19 mM caprylate, and pH 5.1, 24 C, 12 mM caprylate, complete inactivation of BVDV and of HIV and PRV was achieved in less than 3 min. The authors also showed that 40 mM caprylate at pH 5.4 and 40 C in supernatant IV-1, an intermediate in albumin production, inactivated R 4.2 log BVDV almost instantaneously [88] .",

The treatment of human IgG generally consists of incubation at pH 4, with or without traces of pepsin, at temperatures from 30 to 37 C, using a protein content close to 50 g/l, and for more than 20 h. The treatment is intended to eliminate aggregates. Pepsin, when present, is maintained at low concentration to avoid cleavage of the IgG molecule. Several model enveloped viruses were shown to be inactivated under those conditions [92e94]. More than 5e8 log inactivation of HIV and other enveloped viruses used as surrogate models, such as Semliki forest virus (SFV), HSV, VSV, and CMV is achieved. By contrast, poliovirus, as other non-enveloped virus, seems more resistant. The presence of trace concentrations of pepsin added to reduce anticomplementary activity during this procedure has been shown to contribute little to virus kill of most processes [95] . Virus inactivation by acid pH and pepsin is influenced by several parameters. HIV, BVDV, SFV, and PRV are completely inactivated within 5 mine1 h at 37 C but inactivation rate and extent is less at lower temperatures. Increasing the sucrose content from 0 to 15% reduced the rate of inactivation of PRV but not that of SFV. Increasing the NaCl content from 0 to 150 mM reduced the rate of inactivation of SFV but that of PRV was unchanged. An increase in the IgG concentration from 0 to 10% speeds up the inactivation of PRV but decreases that of SFV. Therefore, temperature is a major parameter in the virucidal efficacy of pH-pepsin treatment and the impact of solute composition is virus-dependent [93] . Some fractionation protocols used in antivenom production include a low pH treatment to induce the precipitation of 'euglobulins', which are plasma globulins unstable under these conditions. This step was shown to remove between 2.8 and 3.5 log of EIAV, Sindbis virus, poliovirus and porcine parvovirus [66] . Virus reduction may occur by co-precipitation with the discarded 'euglobulins' rather than by an inactivation process [66] .",

Most often, pasteurisation is performed in the presence of stabilizers, like amino acids, sugars, or citrate [97, 98] , to protect protein functionality, and limit molecular alterations and protein aggregation. Protein stabilizers are also known to stabilize viruses, however, further highlighting the need for validating the exact conditions of treatment used. Pasteurisation can inactivate viruses of different types, enveloped or nonenveloped, including HIV, HBV, HCV, and HAV [80, 96, 98, 99] . There are few published data on the inactivation of resistant model non-enveloped viruses like porcine parvovirus, SV 40 or Reovirus type 3 in plasma products [100, 101] . In most instances, inactivation of such viruses is limited to less than 2e4 log over the 10 h heating period. Heat treatment of whole human plasma at 50 C for 3 h, in the presence of a specific combination of stabilizers, inactivates more than 6 log of HIV, and more than 4 log of enveloped and nonenveloped model viruses [102] . Finally, it was demonstrated that heat treatments like pasteurisation and vapour heat treatment (as well as solvent-detergent and nanofiltration on 35 nm membranes) can inactivate/ remove more than 6 log of WNV [103] .",

For instance, equipment for bulk in process virus inactivation, such as the acid pH incubation or the caprylic acid treatment, should ideally be fully enclosed. In addition, vessels should have temperature controls and be designed to avoid ''dead points'' where important parameters such as temperature and pH could not be ensured. Similarly, liquid heat treatment or heat shock should be conducted in jacketed tanks with the solution stirred throughout the heat cycle to ensure homogeneity and all points in the tank should be within the specified temperature range. During the qualification phases, the equipment and the required services should be shown to conform to the predefined technical specifications and requirements, and to function within the specified limits. When possible, it is recommended to create a dedicated ''viral safety area'' where production steps are arranged in a clear and logical way, so that recontamination of the virally reduced intermediates is avoided. Operating procedures should also be written to reduce the likelihood of crosscontamination. Bulk pH 4 or caprylic acid virus inactivation could be carried out in two stages, the first stage being located in a normal production room, followed by a second incubation in another tank located in a segregated, contained area. The duration of the first stage should be such that the majority of virus inactivation (as found during the viral validation studies) has occurred. On completion of the first stage, the product should be aseptically transferred (e.g. through sterile coupling) into the second vessel located in a safety zone for completion of the second stage of viral inactivation. Product-contacting-equipment used in the safety area should be dedicated or decontaminated to inactivate any remaining virus. A quality assurance system should ensure that the execution of virus reduction methods conforms to the validated conditions.

However, a comparison with validated manufacturing processes used for human IgG clearly indicates that at least two widely used antivenom production steps, caprylic acid treatment and low-pH incubation, are likely to contribute in a robust manner to viral safety, at least against enveloped viruses. The concentration of caprylic acid (5%) used for antivenoms is higher than that used for human IgG (Table 3) , and the pH of treatment is within the effective range (less than pH 6) required for optimal inactivation of enveloped viruses. As the treatment is performed on equine plasma itself, or on crude fractions, the viral kill could be reduced by the presence of lipids. The acid incubation of antivenoms which is performed at a pH (3.1e3.8), less than that used for human IgG, and at a similarly warm temperature (30e37 C) ( Table 5) should provide a fast rate of inactivation of lipidenveloped viruses, and possibly also non-enveloped viruses. However, the incubation time (40 mine24 h) is for some processes significantly less than for human IgG (typically 22e25 h), probably reducing the extent of viral kill achieved. Preliminary viral kill data obtained with antivenoms confirm that conditions used for peptic cleavage at low pH of F(ab#) 2 achieve robust inactivation of WNV [111] . We recommend that further representative viral validation studies using a range of well-established virus models are performed to know the rate and extent of viral kill actually achieved during those production steps. The viruses to use for those validations should be discussed with specialized virologists, and, by analogy with most studies done with human plasma derivatives, might include three lipidenveloped viruses (such as BVDV, VSV, PSR, and WNV) and one non-enveloped virus (such as EMC, poliovirus, or Reovirus 3). Inactivation data could then be compared to viral kills achieved using similar process steps of human IgG products, therefore providing some reference on their robustness and allowing manufacturers and national regulatory authorities to assess scientifically the margin of safety of antivenom products. Other manufacturing steps, such as heat coagulation, could be validated as well. Formulation of the product at low pH, as done for some human IgG preparations, is another potential approach to consider for improved viral safety, but evaluating product stability and efficacy under such conditions would be a pre-requisite. In view of their expected beneficial impact on viral safety, appropriate process implementation of caprylic acid treatments and low-pH incubations should be ensured, as well as measures taken to avoid risks of downstream contamination and, more widely, to respect good manufacturing practices and traceability concepts. Such conclusions should also be valid for other animal plasma-derived IgG products used in human medicine such as anti-lymphocyte/T-cell, antitoxins, and anti-bacterial or viral agents sera [19] . ",
