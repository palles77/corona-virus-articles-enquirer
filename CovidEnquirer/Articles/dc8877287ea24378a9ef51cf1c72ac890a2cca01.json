Mathematically, we use the Markov semigroup theory to prove that the basic reproduction number R s 0 can be used to control the dynamics of stochastic system. Epidemiologically, we show that environment fluctuation can inhibit the occurrence of the disease, namely, in the case of disease persistence for the deterministic model, the disease still dies out with probability one for the stochastic model. So to a great extent the stochastic perturbation under media coverage affects the outbreak of the disease.",

A rapid and timely measure is through the media coverage to tell people how to prevent the spread of the disease [1] [2] [3] . Media education plays a vital role in controlling the spread of the disease. As we know, one big characteristic of the infectious disease is the infectiousness, namely the pathogens of infectious disease, can spread from an infected person to a susceptible person through a certain way. The spread ways of the infectious disease are not the same, and its communication process is influenced by natural factors and social factors [4, 5] . When an infectious disease appears, if we can timely find its route of transmission, and encourage people to learn relevant publicity and education of the disease, thus can effectively control the outbreak of the disease. Media coverage may reduce the contact rate of people, which has been found during the spreading of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 [6] [7] [8] .",

            "text": "It is should be pointed out that, although our SDE model (4) is similar to that in [2] (one incidence rate is bilinear, the other is standard [2] ), the proving methods for stochastically disease dynamics are very different. In [2] , the authors used the method of stochastic stability, and here, we use the Markov semigroup theory to prove stochastically asymptotic stability of model (4) . On the other hand, in [2] , the authors proved that if R s 0 < 1, under an extra conditions of \u03c3 , the disease goes to extinct with probability one (Theorem 3.1 in [2] ); and in Theorem 3.4, we show that only when R s 0 < 1, does the disease die out almost surely, regardless of the intensity of environmental fluctuations \u03c3 . This point may show the different effect on the stochastic dynamics between the bilinear incidence rate with the standard incidence rate.",
