All cats diagnosed with FIP at a veterinary teaching hospital over a 16-year period were identified. Breed, sex and reproductive status of affected cats were compared to the general cat population and to mixed breed cats evaluated during the same period. As with previous studies sexually intact cats and purebreed cats were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with FIP; males and young cats also had a higher prevalence of disease. Abyssinians, Bengals, Birmans, Himalayans, Ragdolls and Rexes had a significantly higher risk, whereas Burmese, Exotic Shorthairs, Manxes, Persians, Russian Blues and Siamese cats were not at increased risk for development of FIP. Although additional factors doubtlessly influence the relative prevalence of FIP, this study provides additional guidance when prioritizing differentials in ill purebreed cats.",

It is caused by a mutation in the feline enteric coronavirus, a common pathogen of cats that may cause no clinical signs or transient diarrhea , McReynolds and Macy 1997 , Hartmann 2005 . The mutated FIP virus disseminates via the monocyte phagocytic system, and variations in an individual cat's immune response produce one of two recognized forms of disease , McReynolds and Macy 1997 , Hartmann 2005 . The 'wet' form of FIP, seen in approximately 75% of cases, is caused by complement-mediated vasculitis initiated by immune complex deposition in vessel walls, and typically results in body cavity effusions , McReynolds and Macy 1997 , Hartmann 2005 . The 'dry' form of FIP, found in the remainder of cases, results when a cell-mediated immune response dominates and granulomas form in various organs , McReynolds and Macy 1997 , Hartmann 2005 .",

These included the Angora (11 cats evaluated during study period), Balinese (25 cats), Belgian (two cats), Bombay (four cats), British Blue (two cats), British Shorthair (three cats), Chartreux (four cats), Colorpoint Shorthair (one cat), Egyptian Mau (one cat), Japanese Bobtail (six cats), Korat (five cats), Maine Coon (151 cats), Maltese (two cats), Norwegian Forest Cat (five cats), Ocicat (16 cats), Ragamuffin (one cat), Scottish Fold (15 cats), Siberian (one cat), Snowshoe (two cats), Somali (three cats), Sphinx (one cat), Tonkinese (18 cats), and Turkish Van (two cats) breeds. Unfortunately, the low prevalence of FIP in the mixed breed cat population prevented determination of significance or relative risk in these purebreed cat varieties. Cats with FIP were significantly more likely to be sexually intact when compared to the general cat population, regardless of whether the cats were male or female (intact male versus castrated male, P ! 0.001; intact female versus spayed female, P Z 0.002; all intact cats versus all altered cats, P ! 0.001; prevalence of intact cats in the general population was 15.8%, versus 45.6% in the FIP population). Although more cats with FIP were male than female, the difference in prevalence was not statistically significant (P Z 0.425; 53.6% of the total cat population was male, versus 59.6% of the FIP population). At the time of last evaluation the median age of cats with FIP was 0.96 years (25th percentile 0.5 years, 75th percentile 2.0 years). Sixty-seven percent of cats with FIP were less than 2 years of age.",

Our results show that certain breeds may in fact be more likely to develop FIP, particularly the Birman, Ragdoll, Bengal, Rex, Abyssinian, and Himalayan breeds. Other breeds of cats, the Burmese, Exotic Shorthair, Manx, Persian, Russian Blue, and Siamese, did not appear to be at increased risk as compared to mixed breed cats. Our results on the effects of sex, reproductive status, and age on the relative prevalence of FIP are similar although not identical to previous studies (Robison et al 1971 , Horzinek and Osterhaus 1979 , Kass and Dent 1995 , Rohrbach et al 2001 .",

Cheetahs, whose genome has become more homozygous with minimal allelic diversity due to an evolutionary bottleneck, have a very high prevalence of FIP (O'Brien et al 1985) . Similarly, the increased prevalence we found in some purebreed varieties could be due to a concentration of inherited factors through in-breeding or small founder populations. Given a common environment and viral strain, Foley and Pedersen (1995) calculated that slightly greater than 50% of FIP susceptibility in purebreed cats from six catteries could be attributed to inherited differences between individuals. Interestingly, in this study one of the catteries with numerous closely related FIP-affected cats was a Birman cattery (Foley and Pedersen 1995) . Birmans were by far the most commonly affected in the study reported here, and therefore we may not be the first to provide evidence of an increase in susceptibility to FIP in this breed.",

Purebreed cats are more likely to be raised in catteries, which may be inherently more stressful because of the multi-cat environment, regular introduction of new cats, and frequent breeding (Kass and Dent 1995, Pedersen 1995) . Additionally, cattery cats presumptively have greater exposure to feline enteric coronavirus (a requirement for development of FIP) due to increased population density (Foley et al 1997a , 1997b , McReynolds and Macy 1997 . Finally, the possible increased willingness of owners of expensive purebreed cats to pursue advanced diagnostics and supportive treatment at a referral veterinary facility such as the NCSU-VTH may skew the apparent prevalence of disease. However, these factors would be expected to falsely increase the prevalence of FIP in all purebreed cats and not just those breeds we report to be at increased risk of disease development.",

For example, it is unknown if the breeds with an increased prevalence of FIP actually had larger numbers of intact cats evaluated, thus influencing our calculations. Furthermore some breeds had very few individuals examined, and the large CI reflect the lack of precision in determining risk. We doubt that the absence of cats diagnosed with FIP in 23 breeds indicates an absolute resistance to disease, although it is possible that some of these breeds (such as Maine Coon cats, which were seen at the NCSU-VTH in relatively larger numbers) possess unrecognized protective factors that influence susceptibility. Unfortunately, because of the low prevalence of FIP in all cats a much larger population would need to be examined to determine if lack of disease in these breeds is statistically significant.",
