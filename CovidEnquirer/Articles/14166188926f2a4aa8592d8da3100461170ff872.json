Objectives: To study the epidemiology and seasonality of viral respiratory infections in hospitalized children (under the age of 16) between September 2012 and August 2016. Study design: Nasopharyngeal swabs or aspirates were collected from 3199 symptomatic patients and then screened with a routine multiplex PCR assay. Results: Respiratory viruses were detected for 1624 (50.8%) of the 3199 children in the study population. Of these, 210 (13.3%) were positive for two viruses, 28 (1.7%) were positive for three, and 3 (0.2%) were positive for four. The viral profile varied with age. Some viruses were significantly more frequent in children under the age of 1 month (such as human respiratory syncytial virus (p < 0.0001)), whereas others were significantly more frequent in children over that age (such as influenza viruses (p < 0.0001) and adenoviruses (p = .0006)). The distribution of viruses is variable over the year depending on the species. However, the atmospheric temperature was rarely found to be a limiting factor in the circulation of respiratory viruses. Conclusions: our results constitute a detailed description of the distribution of respiratory viruses among hospitalized children over four consecutive years. Our data notably highlight the persistence of non-enveloped viruses and some enveloped viruses throughout the year-regardless of temperature variations.",

            "text": "Over recent years, the development of multiplex molecular biology techniques has enabled the rapid detection of respiratory viruses in many different contexts. Indeed, the rapid identification of respiratory pathogens has modified and improved the preventive and curative management of patients. It has been clearly shown that the rapid, accurate identification of respiratory specimens can have a significant impact on disease progression; this enables the introduction of appropriate therapy, decreases the unnecessary use of antimicrobial agents, and thus limits the risk of secondary infections in medical establishments [1] . These multiplex techniques have supplanted traditional methods for the diagnosis of respiratory tract infections (such as cultures, direct fluorescent-antibody staining, and enzyme immunoassays) and are superior in terms of sensitivity, execution time and turn-around time [2] . Lastly, multiplex molecular biology techniques can also be rapidly adapted to detect new or emerging viruses. Although the reagent cost is inherently higher, many studies have clearly demonstrated that appropriately prescribed respiratory multiplex assays are cost-effective and can generate significant savings for hospitals [3] [4] [5] .",

The percentage of patients with a coinfection differed significantly as a function of age (p < 0.0001): 9.5% for children younger than 1 month, 63.7% for children aged between 1 and 24 months, and 26.8% for children aged over 24 months. The viral profile in coinfections (Fig. 1) highlighted the predominance of EV/hRV. Indeed, EV/hRV was found in 161 (76.6%) of the 210 coinfections with two viruses, in 25 of the 28 (89.3%) coinfections with three viruses, and 3 of the 3 (100%) infections with four viruses. The viruses most frequently detected with EV/hRV were the PIV types 1-4 (17.1%), followed by hRSV (15.7%), AdV (14.3%), hBoV (11.4%), hCoVs (7.1%), and hMPV (7.6%).",

Similarly, AdVs were not linked to a particular season and were isolated throughout the year. In contrast, hRSV preferentially infected children in winter, despite a higher number of positive assays in November each year. Although the frequency of influenza viruses was relatively low in our study population, the highest values were observed in the coldest months (from January to March).",

However, the picornaviruses (EVs/hRVs) were most frequent in all age groups. The distribution did not vary greatly with age. In children under 1 month and in those aged between 1 and 24 months, the second and third most frequently detected viruses were hRSV and PIVs, respectively. This ranking differed in children aged over 24 months, where Inf viruses were most frequent and hRSV was the second most frequent type. The high frequency of hRSV infection in infants under the age of 6 months of age has been clearly documented in several studies [18] . Our present results confirm the importance of screening for hRSV in very young children. However, the high proportion of picornaviruses isolated alone or as co-infection in symptomatic children raises the question of their true pathogenicity; further studies are therefore required.",
