Vero cells were dually infected with ca-PEDV and one of the three chlamydial strains Chlamydia trachomatis S45, Chlamydophila abortus S26/3 or Chlamydophila pecorum 1710S. Three experimental protocols were designed varying the inoculation sequence. Cell layers were first inoculated with Chlamydiaceae and 20 h later with ca-PEDV in protocol one. In protocol two, both agents were administered concurrently, whereas in protocol three, ca-PEDV was applied 20 h in advance of the Chlamydiaceae. Immunofluorescence techniques, immunohistochemical (IH) staining and electron microscopy were subsequently employed to investigate the cell layers. Using indirect immunofluorescence (IF) labeling, all mixed infections revealed dually infected cells, however, only incidentally and in low numbers. Characteristically, ca-PEDV syncytia with one or more chlamydial inclusions were detected but dually infected single cells were absent. Some syncytial cells contained enlarged C. abortus or C. pecorum inclusions with abnormally large developmental forms. In comparison with simultaneously conducted monoinfections, larger chlamydial inclusions were observed in dually infected cell layers. Experiments with C. trachomatis showed significantly increased numbers of chlamydial inclusions in dually infected cell layers compared to monoinfected ones. These findings indicate an influence of ca-PEDV on the chlamydial developmental cycle and in the case of C. trachomatis, a positive effect on chlamydial colonization in mixed infections. #",

Until now, little in vivo and no in vitro data on dual infections with Chlamydiaceae and PEDV have been available. However, based on the work of Bernasconi et al. (1995) , where gnotobiotic piglets were monoinfected with a cell culture adapted PEDV (ca-PEDV), and of Guscetti et al. (1996 Guscetti et al. ( , 1998b Guscetti et al. ( , 2000 , where gnotobiotic piglets were monoinfected with Chlamydiaceae, some new experiments were designed. Ca-PEDV and Chlamydophila pecorum 1710S were administered to four groups of gnotobiotic piglets varying the inoculation sequence as follows: (1) ca-PEDV inoculated at 30 h post partum (hpp), C. pecorum at 48 hpp;",

However, in group 4, clinical signs seemed slightly more severe than in monoinfections with C. pecorum. Immunohistochemical (IH) labeling of enterocytes with a genus-specific monoclonal antibody revealed a mild infection with C. pecorum and a higher amount of chlamydial antigen in the groups 2 and 4 than in the groups 1 and 3. The amount of viral antigen detected by a ca-PEDV-specific monoclonal antibody was in the same range in the groups 1-3 and slightly lower in group 4, whereas first detection was significantly delayed in group 4. Thus, an influence of the inoculation sequence on both the course of disease as well as on the replication of each agent was suggested (Grest et al., 2000) .",

For viral antigen detection, a mouse monoclonal antibody against the M protein of PEDV (mcAb 204, kindly provided by Prof. Dr. M. Ackermann, Institute of Veterinary Virology, Zurich, Switzerland), diluted 1:4 in PBS supplemented with BSA and TBS, and an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (rabbit anti-mouse, 1:500, Molecular Probes, Eugene, USA) were used. C. trachomatis S45 inclusions were labeled by a polyclonal goat anti-C. trachomatis-MOMP antibody (1:100, Chemicon International, Temecula, USA) and a Cy3-conjugated rabbit antigoat secondary antibody (1:500, Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, USA). For detection of C. abortus S26/10 and C. pecorum 1710S antigen, a primary rabbit anti-chlamydial lipopolysaccharide antibody (1:50, Biodesign International, Kennebunk, USA) and a secondary Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:50, Zymed Laboratories) were used. All staining procedures were conducted at room temperature. Antibody incubations were carried out for 1 h (primary antibodies) or 45 min (secondary antibodies), respectively, with three washes of PBS following fixation, between and after applications of different antisera. Dually infected cell layers were stained using sequential double immunofluorescence labeling. Coverslips were mounted in Immu-Mount (Shandon, Pittsburgh, USA) on glass slides and viewed with a Leica fluorescence microscope (DMBL). Photographs were taken using a 40\u00c2 PL Fluotar oil objective, an Olympus OM-2N camera and Fuji Velvia ASA 50 film.",

The largest inclusions were found in protocol one (C//V) in dually infected cell layers at 48 h pi, where an absolute incubation period of 68 h for C. tracho-matis has to be considered. Inclusion numbers (Fig. 2) varied from 174 to 304 for protocol one (C// V), from 32 to 407 for protocol two (C + V) and from 49 to 70 for protocol three (V//C).

Given the experimental conditions of that protocol, C. trachomatis S45 inclusions were still very small in monoinfected cell layers after an absolute incubation time of 24 h. As a fact, inclusions smaller than a fifth of the host cell nucleus often were not clearly distinguishable from unspecific staining reactions. Therefore, counting of inclusions was difficult and, to a certain extent, inaccurate in monoinfected cell layers at 24 h pi. Consequently, these results were excluded from the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Nevertheless, a p-value of 0.0051 was found. Variations in inclusion numbers also occurred between the different protocols. Inclusions were seen in much lower numbers in protocol three (V//C) than in the other two protocols.",

Dual infections appeared to be occasional and incidental events, which implies that Chlamydiaceae and ca-PEDV do not preferentially infect the same cell.

This observation might suggest a viral influence in mixed infections with Chlamydiaceae. However, whether the assumed effect of ca-PEDV is a positive or negative one remains to be determined. Thus far, no correlation between the increased inclusion size and the number of inclusions has been evident. The enlarged chlamydial forms of C. abortus S26/3 and C. pecorum 1710S found only in syncytial cells further support the theory of viral interaction. A direct or indirect effect of ca-PEDV on the chlamydial developmental cycle seems possible, and a continued chlamydial growth without proper division and differentiation may be assumed. Kaltenboeck and Storz (1992) had suggested that strain 1710S was highly nutrient dependent and that this could elicit aberrant forms. Ca-PEDV might interfere with the host cell metabolism and either alter or inhibit production of essential nutrients for Chlamydiaceae or induce certain cytokines, such as interferon gamma, with inhibitory effects on chlamydial development (Moulder, 1991) . Beatty et al. (1993 Beatty et al. ( , 1994 Beatty et al. ( , 1995 conducted several in vitro studies focused on interferon gamma-mediated persistent infections with Chlamydiaceae. Those studies also revealed enlarged, abnormal chlamydial forms. In ultrastructural analysis of enterocytes infected with PEDV, decreased energyproducing capacity and functional deficiencies as well as reduced numbers of cell organelles had been described (Ducatelle et al., 1982; Pospischil et al., 1981) . However, it remains unclear which mechanisms were involved in the cell culture systems and what role experimental conditions might have played. Future investigations could include measurement of cell metabolites and cytokines as well as specific variation of physical and chemical cell culture conditions. Lower numbers of ca-PEDV syncytia at 48 h pi than at 24 h pi can be explained by fusion of two or several syncytia as well as detachment from the cell layer after the syncytia had reached a certain size and were consequently washed away during the staining procedure.",
