Viral infection of epithelia can damage or disrupt the epithelial barrier that protects underlying tissues. In vitro cell culture systems are an effective means to study how viruses infect and disrupt epithelial barriers, however no true continuous or immortalized feline epithelial cell culture lines are available. A continuous cell culture of feline mammary epithelial cells (FMEC UCD-04-2) that forms tight junctions with high transepithelial electrical resistance (>2000 cm \u22121 ) 3-4 days after reaching confluence was characterized. In addition, it was shown that FMECs are susceptible to infection with feline calicivirus (FCV), feline herpesvirus (FHV-1), feline coronavirus (FeCoV), and feline panleukopenia virus (FPV). These cells will be useful for studies of feline viral disease and for in vitro studies of feline epithelia.",

            "text": "Many viruses target specifically receptors found on the surface of epithelial cells. Recently, feline junctional adhesion molecule-A (fJAM-A) was identified as a functional receptor for FCV (Makino et al., 2006) . JAM-A localizes to junctional complexes in endothelial and epithelial cells and is important for maintaining intact mucosal epithelial barriers; in JAM-A \u2212/\u2212 mice the colonic mucosal epithelium has increased permeability to small molecules and is infiltrated by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (Laukoetter et al., 2007) . The JAM-A molecule is not readily accessible from the apical side of polarized epithelia (Excoffon et al., 2008) , therefore, an important unanswered question is how FCV gains access to the receptor. In contrast, aminopeptidase N, the receptor for feline coronaviruses, is thought to be present on the apical surface of epithelial cells (Rossen et al., 2001) . The receptor for feline panleukopenia virus is the feline transferrin receptor (Parker et al., 2001) , which is located on the basolateral surface of polarized epithelial cells (Merle et al., 2007) and previous work in canine MDCK cells showed that FPV bound sixfold more efficiently to the basolateral than the apical surface of these cells (Basak and Compans, 1989) . FPV is thought to access the basolateral surface of intestinal crypt epithelial cells following systemic spread. Epithelial cells are the first cell type that feline herpesviruses encounter during infection of a new host, and while it is not known if FHV infects preferentially via apical or basolateral surfaces of epithelial cells, human herpes simplex viruses preferentially infect via the apical surface of epithelial cells (Galen et al., 2006; Hayashi, 1995; Topp et al., 1997) . In order to understand how feline viruses cross epithelial barriers and initiate infection and to discover viral and host cellular factors that regulate these interactions a suitable epithelial cell line that forms tight junctions and that can be cultivated in vitro is needed. A continuous feline mammary epithelial cell line (FMEC UCD-04-2, henceforth FMEC) that forms tight junctions and has a high transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was characterized. In addition, we show that FMECs are susceptible to infection with FCV, FHV-1, FeCoV, and FPV.",

FMEC and CRFK cells were seeded in cell culture inserts with 1 m pores (1 \u00d7 10 5 cells per insert) and the transepithelial resistance was measured daily. Each data point represents the mean resistance ( cm \u22122 ) of four inserts \u00b1 S.D. of a single experiment. and ZO-1 by immunofluorescence microscopy. It was found that ZO-1 and occludin localized, in an uninterrupted manner, along the cell-cell contacts in the intercellular regions of the confluent FMEC monolayer (Fig. 1B and C) . The tight junction was identi- fied in z-plane optical sections as the cell-cell junctional region with maximal ZO-1 staining ( Fig. 2A and B) . Feline junctional adhesion molecule-A (fJAM-A) is a receptor for feline calicivirus (Makino et al., 2006 ) that localizes to tight junctions of epithelial cells in human and murine epithelial cells [reviewed in Mandell and Parkos, 2005] . Similar to the distribution of ZO-1 and occludin, it was found that fJAM-A also localized to cell-cell contacts in FMEC monolayers (Fig. 1D ). By comparison, fJAM-A is distributed diffusely on the surface of CRFK cells (Ossiboff et al., 2007 and data not shown).",

Small molecules can also cross the epithelium through tight junctions that seal the paracellular space between epithelial cells (Schneeberger and Lynch, 2004) . Tight junctions allow the selective passage of some small molecules and ions-normally cations; however, this movement of ions is physiologically restricted and consequently confluent monolayers of epithelial cells that form tight junctions normally have a high TEER. To investigate the junctional permeability of the FMECs, we determined the TEER of FMEC monolayers. TEER readings were also made on CRFK cells, a feline tissue culture cell line that does not form tight junctions. Resistance readings taken over the course of 13 days after the cells were seeded showed that TEER increased in FMECs whereas TEER remained relatively unchanged in CRFK monolayers (Fig. 3) . By day 3 after seeding, the FMEC monolayers were confluent and TEER measurements were increasing. The FMEC monolayer demonstrated a peak TEER of \u223c2000 cm 2 by day 5 that was maintained for at least 8 days thereafter. The CRFK monolayers did not exhibit a resistance greater than 10 cm 2 for the duration of the experiment. It is concluded that FMEC monolayers developed functional tight junctions as evidenced by the increase in TEER.",

Disruption of respiratory (FHV and FCV), oral (FHV and FCV), or enteric (feline panleukopenia virus, FCoV) epithelial function as a consequence of viral infection of epithelial cells plays a major role in the pathogenesis of these viral diseases (De Groot and Horzinek, 1995; Gaskell et al., 2007; Hueffer and Parrish, 2003; Pesavento et al., 2008) . All epithelia share common properties, including morphology, expression of the cytokeratin intermediate filaments (Moll et al., 1982) , and specialized connections between the cells (Gumbiner, 1996) . Our current understanding of the virus:host cell interactions for feline epitheliotropic viruses relies primarily on in vitro studies of immortalized mesenchymal and monocyte cell lines and to a lesser degree on short-term primary epithelial culture (Leeming et al., 2006; Sandmeyer et al., 2005) . The susceptibility of FMECs to four different feline viruses, FCV, FHV, FPV, and FCoV, were examined. The susceptibility of these cells to infection with canine parvovirus, which has been shown previously to infect feline cells and to mammalian reoviruses, which infect a broad range of mammalian cells and can use human and murine JAM-A as functional receptors were examined. It was found that FMECs supported infection by all of these viruses (Fig. 4A-D and data not shown) , indicating that these cells are permissive to a broad range of different virus types.",

These cells may also be useful generally for studying the formation and maintenance of polarized epithelia.",
