In adults, both in the United States and Europe, most (around 80%) patients admitted in ICUs with the diagnosis of sepsis have already been hospitalized for other causes and come from the hospital wards [13, 14] . Severe bacteremia and sepsis caused by the classic pathogens Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pyogenes is rarely found now, and has been replaced by sepsis caused by commensal microbes, which infect individuals with conditions that compromise their skin and mucosal barriers or their immune systems. Advances in surgical techniques including transplant medicine, and increased survival of patients with trauma, splenectomy, and neutropenias are, in part, caused by advances in the treatment of sepsis associated with these conditions. In 40% of the patients no responsible microorganism is isolated, in most the organism isolated from blood or the infection site was one that usually does not cause infection in healthy persons, and frequently the infection is polymicrobial [12, 14] . Although for many years gram-negative bacteria were found in most bacteremic patients with severe sepsis, the percentage of cases associated with blood isolation of gram-positive pathogens has increased in the last decades and now Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and enterococci are responsible for 30% to 50% of the cases. Another recent tendency is to isolate fungi (5%-12%), notably species of Candida [14, 15] . Difficult-to-treat pathogens include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter species, resistant enterococci, and methicillin-resistant S aureus. A new syndrome of severe necrotizing pneumonia produced by infection by community-acquired methicillin-resistant S aureus led to ICU admissions because of the severe manifestations [16] . The organism is now also considered a hospital pathogen [17] .",

The global incidence of tetanus has been estimated at about 1 million cases per year. In the United States the reported cases and deaths from tetanus have decreased substantially since the 1940s because of successful vaccination efforts [34] . The risk of developing clinical tetanus after an acute puncture or laceration is higher in patients older than 60 years, a reflection of waning immunity, with a significant proportion of cases occurring in women [35] , and a low mortality rate. Injection drug users are a growing population at risk [36] . In sharp contrast, the epidemiology of generalized tetanus in developing countries, where mortality figures may be up to 280 times higher, follows closely the problem of lack of immunization efforts. In some areas, neonatal tetanus, occurring in the offspring of unvaccinated women, causes approximately 50% of the cases and mortality.

The fluid regimen of Ringer's lactate at 25 mL/kg over a period of 2 hours is now supported by strong prospective evidence and should be recommended for children with moderately severe shock. For those with severe shock, the situation is less straightforward, and clinicians must continue to rely on personal experience, local availability of particular products, and cost. Minor advantages in initial recovery has been observed with starch, and significantly more adverse reactions were associated with dextran, so if the use of a colloid is considered necessary, starch may be the preferred option [65, 66] .",

Prostration is common in severe disease and may progress to stupor and coma. Patients must be treated in an intensive care facility and isolated from mosquitoes. Hypotension and shock, renal failure, and metabolic acidosis are poor prognostic signs. Severe yellow fever is a very serious disease, with case fatality ratios of 20% to 50%. Secondary bacterial infections worsen the prognosis of many patients but are amenable to treatment. Laboratory confirmation of yellow fever, serologically or from tissue samples, is very important epidemiologically and must be pursued. Supportive measures are used as needed, but no treatment protocols or affective antiviral drugs have been developed. Survival is associated with lifelong immunity.",

The viruses, basically parasites of wild rodents, produce severe pulmonary edema (secondary to increased vascular permeability), hemoconcentration, and shock in humans. The disease commonly starts with severe myalgia and abdominal pain. Severe hypoxia and shock are managed in the ICU and, if the patient survives, reversion of the vascular leak permits complete recovery. Diagnosis is based on the fact that IgM and IgG antibodies are present very early in the illness and can be measured by ELISA on admission. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in blood samples and immunohistochemical staining of tissues may detect hantavirus.

Similarly, the pathophysiologic mechanism involved in the occurrence of hepatic encephalopathy in children with FLF has not been fully defined [77] . Viral agents may cause damage to hepatocytes either by direct cytotoxic effect or as a result of hyperimmune response. Apparently, the interaction between the infectious agent and the host determines the incidence of FLF. Fulminant hepatic failure is an uncommon but devastating illness in which the liver fails in a short period of time (!8 weeks in the initial definition [1] ) in the absence of chronic liver disease. It must be distinguished from the much more common acute decompensation that develops abruptly and without warning in patients with chronic liver disease. In fulminant hepatic failure, mortality rate is higher and significant morbidity results from cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension, which are rare in patients with chronic disease. Fulminant hepatic failure is defined by the development of coagulopathy and encephalopathy and is associated with rapid progression of multiple organ system failure. Acetaminophen has surpassed viral hepatitis as the leading cause of fulminant hepatic failure in the United States and accounts for 39% and perhaps as much as 50% of the cases [2, 3] . Mortality rate is high but recovery is possible in 20% to 50% of patients with supportive care. The decision to proceed to liver transplantation is complicated. Although the course may be protracted, recovery is usually complete. Liver transplantation remains the sole lifesaving option for many patients. Patients who have fulminant hepatitis have a mortality of up to 50% and should be transferred immediately to a facility that offers liver transplantation [78] . Nevertheless, with an improved understanding and recognition of the syndrome, more aggressive medical therapy, intensive monitoring, and the advent of orthotopic liver transplantation as a treatment option, survival rates have improved considerably [79] . FLF constitutes a medical emergency with a tendency to evolve rapidly and the prompt response of experienced clinicians is imperative for a successful outcome to be achieved.",
