This study uses a Markov-switching model (MSM) proposed by Hamilton (1989) to analyze the Taiwanese tourist hotel industry cycle. The MSM decomposes the tourist hotel industry cycle into two distinct states: high-growth and low-growth (HGS and LGS). The mean growth rate of HGS is 1.5% and the average growth rate of LGS is 0.07% during the period from December 1999 to February 2011. The corresponding standard deviations in the two regimes are 0.008% and 0.038%, implying that HGS is more stable than LGS. Moreover, the probability of staying in HGS is 94% and the probability of remaining in LGS is 65%. The expected durations of HGS and LGS are about 16 and 3 months, respectively. Further, the paper investigates the factors that keep the THI in HGS. Empirical test results show that growth in the international tourism market and industrial production growth rate are two key factors that keep the THI in HGS, but the SARS outbreak in 2003 has had an adverse effect.",

Taiwan has traditionally been an export-oriented country, not a popular international tourist destination. However, understanding that the proceeds from tourism expansion can represent a significant income source for the national economy (Kim et al., 2006) , the Taiwanese government has begun developing its international tourism market. Moreover, Chen (2011) showed that the development of the Taiwanese THI relies on the growth of the tourism market, proxied by the growth of total foreign tourist arrivals. Specifically, the tourism market expansion could explain 53% of occupancy rate, 92% of revenue per available room, 45% of return on asset and 48% of return on equity of tourist hotels in Taiwan.",

In that year, the TBT introduced the \"Doubling Tourist Arrivals Plan\" (DTAP), designed to strengthen the national economy by attracting 5 million international visitors to Taiwan by 2008. Although the DTAP was a casualty of poor global economic performance and the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the TBT introduced several more tourism promotion plans to promote international tourism and attract more foreign tourists. In 2005, the Tourism Flagship Plan was launched to promote the nation's top attractions and cultural festivals. The Tour Taiwan (TBT, 2008) . One of his policies was to re-open direct flights between Taiwan and China, which had been banned since 1949. Taiwan and China signed the agreement to restore regular direct flights between the two regions on June 13, 2008 and direct flights resumed on July 4, 2008. Since then, up to 3000 Chinese tourists a day are allowed to visit Taiwan and the number increased from 3000 to 7200 after May 2009. In 2011, Chinese tourists were allowed to visit Taiwan without having to join tour groups.

In addition, the average growth rate of state 0 is 1.5% and that of state 1 is 0.7%, indicating that state 0 is the highgrowth state (HGS) and state 1 is the low-growth state (LGS). Accordingly, the standard deviations of HGS and LGS are 0.8% and 3.8%, respectively.

A positive economic impact usually leads to an increase in sales and hence improves the performance of hotel firms. For example, Chen, Kim, and Kim (2005) found that UEP and DMS had a significant influence on the Taiwanese hotel stock returns. Chen (2007) demonstrated that DIP could significantly promote financial performance of hotel companies. In addition to the general economic variables, Chen (2010) argued that tourism market growth, proxied by DTA, could have a strong and positive effect on hotel performance. On the one hand, DTA can directly enhance the development of hotel industry by raising the occupancy rate and sales revenue. On the other hand, DTA can significantly improve economic condition, which has an indirect impact on the corporate performance of hotel firms.",

These results contribute to the literature of the empirical studies on the Taiwanese tourist hotel industry by showing that DTA, DIP and DSARS are three significant factors that keep the THI in HGS. Specifically, the influences of DIP and DTA are positive and the effect of DSARS is negative, both of which are consistent with results in Chen (2007 Chen ( , 2010 .

In other words, the mean growth rate of HGS is more than 20 times of the size of LGS. These results imply that the industry has somehow avoided entering a recession for the past 12 years because even the mean growth rate of LGS was positive. Moreover, the standard deviation (risk) in two regimes is 0.008% and 0.038%, meaning that HGS is more stable than LGS.",

The findings indicate that the industry has a high tendency to stay in HGS and a low tendency to shift from HGS to LGS. Third, the expected duration of HGS is about 16 months, and that of LGS is about three months. This shows that the Taiwanese THI cycle is asymmetric and especially the expected duration of HGS of THI is about five times longer than that of LGS.",

Using IP data that is a monthly measure can hence provide more sample observations. Finally, while DTA, DIP and DSARS are found to be significant factors of the THI cycle, the three factors together can only explain about 42% of the variation of the THI in HGS. This indicates that a large portion of the probability of the THI in HGS is still unexplained and could be impacted by other factors. One potential determinant is the development of the global economy, which is expected to have a strong influence on DTA. Future studies can examine whether the global economic condition or some other factors could significantly affect the THI cycle.",
