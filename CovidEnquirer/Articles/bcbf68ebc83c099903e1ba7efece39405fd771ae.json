Clinics enrolled voluntarily and each clinic sampled approximately 110 horses; no more than 10 horses sampled from each clinic resided on the same farm. Jugular venipuncture was used to collect 10 mL of whole blood from each horse. Additionally, age, breed, primary use, and sex data were collected for each horse by questionnaire.

Briefly, microtiter plates were coated with 0.0156 \u03bcg recombinant protein per well and sera were tested at a dilution of 1 \u03bcL serum in 100 \u03bcL of buffer. Each plate contained known negative and positive controls. Negative controls consisted of sera collected from healthy adult horses from the university herd with no history of systemic disease and qPCR-negative feces for ECoV. Positive controls consisted of sera collected from horses 30 days after they developed clinical signs compatible with ECoV infection and tested qPCR-positive for ECoV in the faeces. A secondary horseradish-peroxidase labelled IgG was used to bind with ECoV-specific antibodies from the serum samples. An enzyme substrate (Bethyl ELISA starter accessory kit II) was used to detect the secondary antibody. The optical density (OD) of each well was measured and corrected by subtracting the average of the OD values of the negative control samples. Sera were considered positive if the corrected value was above the average plus three times the standard deviation of the OD of the negative control samples (Kooijman et al., 2016) .",

The study focused on the detection of IgG-specific antibodies against ECoV because the IgG isotype has been shown to persist in the blood of cattle experimentally infected with BCoV for up to 22 months, while the IgM isotype response to BCoV only persisted up to 43 days (Tr\u00e5v\u00e9n et al., 2001) . In our study, the seroprevalence of ECoV was 9.6% in 5247 healthy, adult horses from 18 different US states. Since follow-up data to determine the duration of antibodies against ECoV in seropositive horses were unavailable, it is possible that our cross-sectional study underrepresented the true seroprevalence of ECoV in our sample set. Following exclusion of the effect of farm origin, seropositivity was significantly associated with horses from the Mid-West, Draft horses and specific uses including ranch/farm and breeding use. A Swedish study of BCoV in 2007 also found region was a significant variable, in addition to herd size, biosecurity measures (i.e. boots for visitors) and distance to the nearest herd (animal density; Ohlson et al., 2010) . It would be interesting to investigate whether these risk factors also apply to horses, but such information was unavailable for our study.",

Furthermore, 60% of the study horses were used as ranch or farm horses in the Mid-West and 33% of all Draft horses were used for ranch and farm work. Horses used for breeding in the Mid-West accounted for 43% of the total Draft horses used for breeding across regions.

Because there are more foals and young horses at breeding farms, such operations represent relatively large, high-risk populations, which could contribute to increased spread of ECoV and, hence, higher seroprevalence.
