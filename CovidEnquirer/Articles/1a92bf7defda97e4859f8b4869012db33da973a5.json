Although the number of patients waiting to receive a lung transplant continues to rise, only 20% of donor lungs meet functional criteria for transplantation. 1 This underuse of donor organs combined with the rising number of patients in need represents a major contributor to waitlist mortality. 2, 3 Many of the conditions that render donor lungs unacceptable for transplantation (eg, aspiration, infection, and pulmonary contusions) are potentially reversible, but conventional methods of donor lung preservation rely on nonphysiologic cold static ischemia and preclude endogenous repair and recovery. 4, 5 Ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) aims to address these limitations by providing initially unacceptable donor lungs with physiologic conditions-normothermia, perfusion, ventilation-to recover function outside the body to a level acceptable for transplantation. 6, 7 Since the introduction of EVLP by Steen and colleagues in 2001, 8 EVLP platforms have demonstrated short-term support and recovery of marginal quality donor lungs in preclinical and clinical settings. [8] [9] [10] [11] However, EVLP has been unable to recover the majority of unusable donor lungs, likely due to the inability of an isolated single-organ support system to provide an appropriate physiologic milieu that enables endogenous repair.",

To overcome these limitations, our group previously used a swine model of cross-circulation (XC) to establish a lung support system that extended normothermic extracorporeal support to 36 hours and enabled statistically significant ex vivo recovery of severely injured lungs. 12, 13 The use of an XC system to achieve ex vivo lung recovery mimics the clinical setting where in situ recovery of marginal quality lungs is achieved in patients placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support for several days after transplantation. 14-16 Motivated by this clinical practice, we hypothesize that extending the duration of extracorporeal support from hours to days could not only enable the recovery of damaged lungs not currently salvageable using EVLP systems but also enable investigation of bioengineering strategies to improve or personalize organs before transplantation.",

Such an approach avoids the adverse effects of anesthetic agents and recipient immobility, provides access to nutrition ad libitum, and models a translational setup of XC between a patient and a donor organ. Throughout 4 days of normothermic support, all extracorporeal lungs and conscious swine recipients were subjected to longitudinal analyses to assess the safety and stability of the organ support system.",

The inflammatory response of recipient swine was evaluated by quantification of serum inflammatory cytokine levels. From baseline to day 4, mean serum concentrations of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interferon gamma (IFNg), interleukin (IL) 1b, Il-1ra, IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) variably increased, with the largest increases in IL-1b (10.4-fold), IFNg (19.2-fold), and IL-1ra (69-fold).

Notably, the largest increase of inflammatory cytokine concentrations in BAL fluid was IL-4 (5.5-fold), and the largest decrease was IFNg (104.9-fold). To assess the degree of injury in extracorporeal lungs, tissue samples were subjected to blinded histopathologic review and assigned lung injury scores ( Figure 6 , G) according to an established injury scoring rubric ( Figure E4 , C). Polymorphonuclear cells, indicators of immune response to injury, remained low in airways but gradually increased in alveoli. Alveolar and interstitial edema increased slightly, which was consistent with the observed increase in lung weight. Nevertheless, the lack of significant increase in any lung injury category score from baseline to day 4 suggests that the extracorporeal lungs experienced minimal to no injury over 4 days of normothermic support.",

This system extends the duration of normothermic extracorporeal lung support significantly beyond the capability of current ex vivo lung perfusion systems, from hours to multiple days. Our hypothesis is that homeostatic normothermic extracorporeal support for days to weeks could offer new opportunities for the assessment, recovery, and regeneration of donor lungs. Additionally, we established new methods to enable multiday XC of whole blood between extracorporeal lungs and a conscious large animal. Our results demonstrate feasibility that lungs can be maintained outside the body for 4 days with outstanding preservation of respiratory function, lung tissue structure, and cellular integrity and metabolism. Such a system offers a developmental platform for advanced therapeutic interventions such as gene or cell therapies for extracorporeal or intracorporeal organs. Three new methodologies were developed in this study: a swine behavioral training program (Table E7 and Figure E5 ) implemented 2 weeks before the start of XC to acclimate recipient swine to the custom enclosure used during the procedure, a technique to manage full recovery of anesthetized cannulated recipient swine to consciousness using a Panepinto sling and custom enclosure, and a novel extracorporeal circuit configuration with a single-site dual-lumen cannula to enable maintenance of circuit parameters within acceptable ranges. Altogether, these methods may prove useful in future translational studies involving the connection of conscious large animals or humans to extracorporeal circuits for organ support.",

In our previous studies, this height difference was fixed, as recipient swine were anesthetized and therefore immobile for the duration of all procedures. In this study, recipient swine were conscious and free to stand upright or lay prone at will, which resulted in intermittent changes in the height difference between the extracorporeal lungs and recipient swine. Adjustments to the height of the lungs were therefore necessary to maintain the target height difference of 10 cm. Controlled adjustments of lung height were performed manually using a hydraulic lift, but were technically challenging to perform in real time. Consequently, variabilities in pulmonary vein pressures resulting from changes in swine position, in conjunction with the persistent prone position of extracorporeal lungs, likely contributed to the development of dependent interstitial edema, most notably observed in the upper lobes.",

Future studies using a multiday extracorporeal support system could help elucidate the roles of cytokines in extracorporeal lung support systems. Several technical challenges remain to be resolved in the current system: specification and regulation of a long-term extracorporeal organ environment, controlled variability of extracorporeal organ orientation, and appropriate ventilation and perfusion management strategies. The inability to strictly regulate dynamic hydrostatic pressure changes led to the development of edema, necessitating future development of feedbackregulated pump controls and an automated organ height adjustment system capable of responding precisely in real time to dynamic changes in swine position, transpulmonary pressure gradient, and lung weight.

            "text": "Dr Mulligan. Following up on that, I got the sense in reading your manuscript that maybe at the 4-day mark you are bumping into your wall. You started to see more edema, more alveolar infiltrates; you saw extension of the sort of subpleural thickening. Do you think the revisions that you can make now can further extend beyond 4 days, because they are allowing pneumonia to recover, traumatic injury to recover. You may need more time. Do you have practical steps for your next iteration? Dr Hozain. This was a feasibility study to extend the duration of support to 4 days and we learned several things along the way, especially technical issues. Variability in static pressure in the pulmonary veins of the donor lung occurred as the animal would stand or lie down and required recurrent height adjustments to maintain a constant static pressure. We are working on a system that would allow for automatic adjustment to better maintain stability in pressure gradients. Along these lines and as you suggested earlier, the organ cannot lie in a static position for an extended period of time without suffering from dependent edema. As we extended the duration of support to 4 days, we realized that the lungs would develop dependent edema. We have constructed a solution to this problem and have started testing it. The extended duration platform has forced us to solve new problems that do not manifest in static positioning for 24-or 36-hour runs. We are confronted with developing mechanisms to maintain the external environment of the extracorporeal organ.",

Initially, swine were maintained in the custom enclosure for up to 1 hour. Through days 5 to 14 of training, recipient swine were maintained in the custom enclosure for at least 2 hours per day to increase comfort and familiarity with the experimental environment. The width of the custom enclosure was incrementally reduced to limit rotational movements ( Figure E5 , B). Behavior training was essential to minimize stress and maximize comfort of recipient swine, and thus decrease risk of decannulation during cross-circulation procedures.

Secondary antibody (Abcam, ab150077) was diluted 1:300 and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Sections were subsequently mounted, and images were obtained using a fluorescent microscope (FSX100; Olympus). Bronchoresponsiveness. Airway smooth muscle tone in extracorporeal lungs was assessed after 4 days of normothermic support by intratracheal delivery of nebulized methacholine chloride (4 mg). Changes in peak inspiratory pressures were recorded for 1 minute before and 5 minutes after delivery of methacholine chloride. Cell viability assay. To assess cell viability in the parenchyma of extracorporeal lungs, carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (eBioscience) was reconstituted in dimethyl sulfoxide at a concentration of 1.06 M. After 4 days of normothermic support, carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester was delivered via flexible bronchoscope into distal regions of left and right lower lobes of extracorporeal lungs and incubated for 15 minutes. Lung tissue samples were then collected, washed 5 times with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in cold phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 hours, embedded, deparaffinized, mounted, and imaged using a fluorescence microscope (FSX100). Metabolic activity assay. To assess cellular metabolism in extracorporeal lungs, tissue samples were collected from the parenchyma at baseline, day 2, and day 4 of normothermic support. Tissue samples (volume: 250 mL; triplicates) were finely minced, gently homogenized, and placed in a 96-well plate. Cell metabolism assay reagent (Alamar Blue; ThermoFisher) was diluted 1:10 in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and 100 mL Alamar Blue reagent was added to wells containing lung sample homogenates. E3 Alamar Blue reagent alone (100 mL) was added to wells containing no lung homogenate (negative controls). The multiwell plate was protected from light and incubated at 37 C with gentle shaking for 2 hours. Following incubation, absorbance was measured at 570 nm and normalized to absorbance at 600 nm. To obtain a benchmark comparison of metabolic activity to healthy swine lungs in vivo, fresh lung tissues were collected from healthy swine immediately following thoracotomy, and metabolic activity assays were performed on both extracorporeal swine lung tissue samples and fresh healthy swine lung tissue samples. .
