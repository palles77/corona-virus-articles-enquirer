            "text": "T10B9.1A-31/MEDI-500 is a nonmitogenic immunoglobulin M kappa murine monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the alpha-beta (\u03b1\u03b2) heterodimer of the T-lymphocyte receptor complex. The hybridoma was first produced by fusing spleen cells from BALB/C mice immunized with human peripheral blood T-lymphocytes with SP2/O-Ag14 mutant myeloma cells. The mAb is produced and purified using multistep ion exchange and molecular sieve chromatography protocols. T10B9 has been used successfully to treat acute cellular rejection in renal transplantation and as an immunosuppression induction agent in heart and simultaneous kidney-pancreas transplantation. Because T10B9 is nonmitogenic and causes minimal cytokine release, both treatment of rejection and induction of immunosuppression were accomplished with significantly fewer and milder untoward effects (cytokine release syndrome) than its comparator OKT3. Since T10B9 is directed against the \u03b1\u03b2 heterodimer of the CD3 epitope, it spares the gamma delta (\u03b3\u03b4) region. These gamma delta (\u03b3\u03b4) T cells have a unique role in the immune response controlling many serious human diseases and perhaps facilitating the development of immunologic tolerance. T10B9 has a relatively short duration of action, depleting T cells for only 10 to 14 days, unlike the protracted depletion seen with thymoglobulin and Campath-1H. There is no B-lymphocyte depletion with T10B9 as there is with both of the aforementioned reagents. The lack of prolonged lymphocyte depletion may account for less infection observed with T10B9 treatment.",

            "text": "Induction of immunosuppression has become a standard therapy in the United States with over 70% of transplantation programs using agents to inhibit the first rejection response. The drugs most often used fall into three categories; 1) the interleukin-2 anti-CD25 selective blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAb) such as basiliximab and daclizumab, 2) polyclonal antisera against T-lymphocytes such as rabbit antilymphocyte globulin (Thymoglobulin) or 3) the mAb alemtuzumab (Campath-1H) which targets T and B cells. The latter two agents have significant effects on B-cells. After an initial dose of 30 mg, Campath-1H profoundly suppresses T-cells for up to 330 days and B-cells for 90 to 150 days. Thymoglobulin significantly suppresses T-cells for up to 90 days and has a profound anti-B-cell effect from 15 to 980 days, opening many windows for opportunistic infection. (Figure 1 ). [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Clearly there would be an advantage for a shorter acting immunosuppression agent which allows T-cell recovery, has little or no effect on B cells and, therefore, does not produce profound long-term immunosuppression. Waid Dovepress OKT3, the first mAb shown to be effective in treating acute cellular rejection, is such a short-acting agent; however, it causes significant adverse events including those related to its mitogenicity and marked stimulation of inflammatory cytokines. T10B9.1A-31/MEDI-500 is a short-acting but murine immunoglobulin M kappa (IgM\u03ba) mAb that is nonmitogenic in vitro which was developed at the University of Kentucky. The purpose of this review is to discuss T10B9.1A-31 (T10B9) briefly describing its manufacturing process, state its known mechanism of action with comparison to OKT3, give a synopsis of T10B9's clinical efficacy, discuss the ability of T10B9 therapy to spare \u03b3\u03b4 T cells which may be important in infection and in the development of tolerance; and finally to support the thesis that a shorter acting more selective anti-T-lymphocyte monoclonal antibody may be a better choice for induction of immunosuppression and/or treatment of acute rejection.",

            "text": "T10B9.1A-31 is a nonmitogenic IgM\u03ba isotype murine mAb. It was produced by fusing spleen cells from BALB/C mice immunized with human peripheral blood T-lymphocytes with SP2-0/Ag-14 mutant myeloma cells. After preliminary screening and cloning three times by limiting dilution, it was determined that T10B9 was directed at a monomorphic antigen expressed on all post-thymic peripheral blood T-cells, but not on other circulating cells or cell precursors. With the help of the College of Pharmacy at the University of Kentucky, the initial production, purification, and lyophilization of stable clinical material was achieved and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for T-cell depletion under BB-IND-4279. Although the first lot of T10B9 was extracted from mouse ascites, subsequent lots were produced in vitro and purified with proprietary multistep ion exchange and molecular sieve chromatography protocols. The final product exhibited 95%-100% protein purity using SDS-PAGE analysis and passed the FDA recommended testing for bacterial, fungal, and viral sterility, general safety and pyrogen. [12] [13] [14] T10B9: Proposed mechanism of action The therapeutic effectiveness of unmodified murine anti-T cell mAb in reversing acute human allograft rejection is dependent on the combination of both antibody isotype and idiotype interactions with their respective ligands or epitopes. The most successful are those specific for the CD3/TCR \u03b1\u03b2 antigen recognition complex. 15 The mechanism of OKT3 action (a murine IgG2a mAb) includes interaction of its Fc portion with the high affinity Fc gamma receptor I that is present on monocytes. This produces immune activation followed by immunosuppression. T10B9, a murine IgM\u03ba isotype, is specific for the TCR \u03b1\u03b2 heterodimer region of the CD3 complex, does not react with Fc gamma receptor I and thus exhibits reduced immune stimulation and the cytokine release syndrome. The TCR \u03b1\u03b2 specificity of T10B9 is defined by its ability to modulate the \u03b1\u03b2 but not the \u03b3\u03b4 TCR whereas OKT3 modulates both types of CD3 T cell receptors. Since T10B9 is directed against the \u03b1\u03b2 TCR and OKT3 against the CD3 \u03b5 (Epsilon) part of the CD3 complex, they differ idiotypically. They are isotypically different as well because T10B9 is an IgM\u03ba and OKT3 is an IgG2a murine isotype. Therefore, human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) directed against one monoclonal antibody does not neutralize the other mAb; they are not cross-reactive. Indeed, patients with allograft rejection not responding to therapy with one monoclonal antibody have successfully been treated with the alternative agent. 16 Attempts to fully humanize T10B9 have been unsuccessful to date; however, there is a chimeric mAb which appears to be comparable to the parent compound in vitro (JST, personal communication).

Compared to OKT3, serum creatinine began falling after two days of T10B9 therapy instead of three days and the peak serum creatinine rise seen with OKT3 therapy was not present ( Figure 4 ). Consistent with its lack of mitogenicity, there was significantly less cytokine (TNF\u03b1 and INF\u03b3) release seen after T10B9 administration (Figure 4 ). Additionally in the T10B9 treated patients there were fewer serious infections, no PTLD and no significant increase in the development of HAMA. 18 T10B9 has been successfully used as an immunosuppression induction agent in heart transplantation 19 and in simultaneous kidney-pancreas transplantation. 20 T10B9 is also used for T-lymphocyte depletion in harvested bone marrow prior to haploidentical bone marrow transplantation to control graft versus host disease. 12, 13 Unlike other monoclonal and polyclonal antibody preparations, there is no experience in treating acute leukemia or aplastic anemia.",

They can also control the host immune response and thereby present or limit the immunopathology that may occur if there is a sustained response to the initial stress. Taken together it is clear that the \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes are actually a critical component of the immune system with particular reference to the control of many opportunistic infections and the maintenance of homeostasis. Currently, the drugs used for immunosuppression induction or the treatment of rejection suppress both the \u03b1\u03b2 and the \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes populations. For example, Thymoglobulin \u00ae not only suppresses T lymphocytes but also B lymphocytes and Campath-1H suppresses T and B lymphocytes and monocytes. There have only been two monoclonal antibodies that uniquely target the \u03b1\u03b2 TCR, T10B9 and BMA 031. These two differ by the fact that BMA 031 is mitogenic and T10B9 is not. Hence, their toxicity profiles are quite different. Studies have not been performed to demonstrate that sparing \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes makes a difference in solid organ transplantation outcome. Increased \u03b3\u03b4 T cells 100 days post-bone marrow transplantation predict a long-term favorable outcome. However, the direct evidence that sparing \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes is beneficial to transplant outcome is mostly derived from the reported experience using T10B9 for T cell depletion of donor marrow/stem cells at several centers 23, 33, 34 and in solid organ transplantation trials where the overall infection rate was only 16.7%. 16, 17, 19 This compares favorably to induction with rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (Thymoglobulin \u00ae ) versus basiliximab (Simulect \u00ae ) where the rate of all infections at 12 months was reportedly 85.8% and 75.2%, respectively. 35 The studies above suggest that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells appear to be important in the control of many serious human diseases, most of which unfortunately accompany immunosuppression. These cells also appear to have the capability to facilitate the development of immunologic tolerance. These are features that could be maximized by using T10B9 for both transplant immunosuppression induction and for treatment of rejection. Parenthetically, T10B9 may be particularly useful in composite tissue transplantation. This hypothesis is based on the observation of Siemionow and others [36] [37] [38] that an antirat Mab directed only at the a/b chains of the T-cell receptor T10B9 specifically binds with the \u03b1\u03b2 chains and spares the \u03b3\u03b4 chains of the T-cell receptor T10B9 prevents cellular rejection Dovepress submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com Dovepress was critically important for the development of long term tolerance to allogeneic composite transplants. Thus, sparing \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes may provide an important benefit in stem cell and solid organ transplantation.",

In vitro it does not induce DNA synthesis, the expression of activation antigens or cytokine release, which is in contrast to OKT3. Clinically T10B9 is effective in the reversal of acute renal allograft rejection, exhibits lower morbidity and induces lower TNF\u03b1 and INF\u03b3 levels after infusion. Finally, it spares \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes which have a unique and important role in the immune response; ie, in controlling many serious human diseases while inducing \u03b1\u03b2 T cell immunosuppression and perhaps facilitating the development of immunologic tolerance. Given the apparent advantages of T10B9 over currently available polyclonal and monoclonal reagents, would a shorter acting immunosuppressive agent be a better therapeutic choice? Is it time for a paradigm shift?",
