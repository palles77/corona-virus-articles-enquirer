            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus, is characterized by a high mutation rate with the potential of genetically diverse strains evolving over time (Forsberg et al., 2001; Hanada et al., 2005; Pirzadeh et al., 1998; Rowland et al., 1999) . In the past, PRRSV isolates have emerged within the swine population with varying degrees of virulence (Fang et al., 2007; Han et al., 2006; Nelsen et al., 1999) possibly due to a high degree of mutation and recombination (Yuan et al., 1999 (Yuan et al., , 2000 (Yuan et al., , 2001 (Yuan et al., , 2004 . More recently, attention has focused on the occurrence of high mortality in Chinese swine herds which Veterinary Microbiology 158 (2012) [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] To determine differences in infection kinetics of two temporally and genetically different type 2 porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) isolates in vivo with and without concurrent porcine circovirus (PCV) type 2a or 2b infection, 62 pigs were randomly assigned to one of seven groups: negative controls (n = 8); pigs coinfected with a 1992 PRRSV strain (VR-2385) and PCV2a (CoI-92-2a; n = 9), pigs coinfected with VR-2385 and PCV2b (CoI-92-2b; n = 9), pigs coinfected with a 2006 PRRSV strain (NC16845b) and PCV2a (CoI-06-2a; n = 9), pigs coinfected with NC16845b and PCV2b (CoI-06-2b; n = 9), pigs infected with VR-2385 (n = 9), and pigs infected with NC16845b (n = 9). Blood samples were collected before inoculation and at day post-inoculation (dpi) 3, 6, 9 and 12 and tested for the presence of PRRSV antibody and RNA, PCV2 antibody and DNA, complete blood counts, and interferon gamma (IFN-g) levels. Regardless of concurrent PCV2 infection, VR-2385 initially replicated at higher levels and reached peak replication levels at dpi 6. Pigs infected with VR-2385 had significantly higher amounts of viral RNA in serum on both dpi 3 and dpi 6, compared to pigs infected with NC16845b. The peak of NC16845b virus replication occurred between dpi 9 and dpi 12 and was associated with a delayed anti-PRRSV antibody response in these pigs. PCV2 coinfection resulted in significantly more severe macroscopic and microscopic lung lesions and a stronger anti-PRRSV IgG response compared to pigs infected with PRRSV alone. This work further emphasizes in vivo replication differences among PRRSV strains and the importance of coinfecting pathogens.",

The PRRSV isolates involved in porcine high fever disease contained unique nucleotide differences compared to other isolates. Specifically, a discontinuous, 30 amino acid deletion was identified within the nsp2 region which was initially suggested to be correlated with the pathogenicity of the virus Wu et al., 2009 ). However, more recent reports have concluded that this deletion is unrelated to virulence (Zhou et al., 2009) in spite of the high mortality that was initially associated with this PRRSV variant Tong et al., 2007) . Interestingly, analysis of 582 samples from affected pigs resulted in the identification of PRRSV, porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and classical swine fever virus as the most common co-infection pathogens, suggesting that a potential synergistic interaction among these viruses may account for the unusually high mortality (Lv et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2009 ). PCV2 is a small, circular, non-enveloped DNA virus belonging to the Circoviridae family in the genus Circovirus. PCV2 can be further divided into several subtypes of which PCV2a and PCV2b are prevalent worldwide (Patterson and Opriessnig, 2010) . To date, experimental infections comparing PCV2a and PCV2b in gnotobiotic and conventional pigs have not demonstrated major differences in virulence (Beach et al., 2010; Fort et al., 2008; Lager et al., 2007; Opriessnig et al., 2008b) . PCV2 is the cause of porcine circovirus associated disease (PCVAD) with multiple clinical manifestations including respiratory disease . PRRSV has become an important component of the porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) with major economic impact on the swine industry (Chae, 2005) . Retrospective studies identified PRRSV as the most common cofactor in cases of PCVAD (Pallar\u00e9 s et al., 2002) . Experimental coinfection with PRRSV and PCV2 has yielded mixed results. One study completed in 2002 reported minimal clinical disease or death loss in conventional pigs coinfected with PCV2 and PRRSV (Rovira et al., 2002) . In contrast, in another study, severe clinical disease and death in 10 of 11 pigs between 10 and 21 days postinfection (dpi) was reported in dually infected, caesarianderived and colostrum-deprived (CDCD) pigs (Harms et al., 2001) . Despite differences in severity of clinical presentation, experimental coinfection of pigs with PCV2 and PRRSV has consistently resulted in up-regulation of PCV2 replication (enhanced viremia and PCV2 tissue load) and increased severity of PRRSV-induced lesions in lung tissues (Allan et al., 2000; Harms et al., 2001; Rovira et al., 2002) .",

In addition, batch 3 (B3) consisted of 9 colostrum-fed crossbred pigs derived from sows free of PRRSV and M. hyopneumoniae but seropositive for PCV2. B2 and B3 pigs were challenged at the same age as B1 pigs but the experiment was conducted approximately 24 months after B1 pigs.

The pigs from the different batches were kept in different but identical rooms. Each room had 18 m 2 of solid concrete floor space, separate ventilation systems and one nipple drinker. Inoculation was conducted at approximately 23 days of age. Blood samples were collected from all pigs prior to inoculation and at dpi 3, 6, 9 and 12 in serum separator tubes (8.5 ml BD Vacutainer, Benton Dixon, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). The blood was centrifuged at 2000 \u00c2 g for 10 min at 4 8C and serum was stored at \u00c080 8C until testing. Serum samples were analyzed for levels of anti-PCV2 IgG antibody, anti-PRRSV-IgG antibody, IFN-g, PCV2 DNA, and PRRSV RNA. In addition, EDTA tubes (8.5 mL MONOJECT TM 15% EDTA liquid, Tyco Healthcare Group LP, Mansfield, MA, USA) were collected at dpi 3, 6, 9, and 12, stored at room temperature and used within 12 h after collection to determine blood cell counts. All pigs were necropsied on dpi 12 and tissues collected during necropsy were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the presence of PCV2 and PRRSV antigens.

Summary statistics were calculated for groups to assess the distributional property and data that were not distributed normally (PCR data) were log transformed prior to analysis. As log transformation can only be applied to numbers above 0, a constant number (1) was added to each number in the data set prior to log transformation. A linear mixed model with the random effects ''Source'' (Source A: B1 and B2 and Source B: B3) and ''Batch'' (B1, B2, B3, nested within ''Source'') and the fixed effects ''PRRSV strain'' (none, VR-2385, NC16845b) and ''PCV2 subtype'' (none, PCV2a, PCV2b) was used first on all outcomes. From this, it was determined that the random effect ''Source'' contributed to the overall variation whereas ''Batch'' did not. To decrease the heterogeneity of the animals in the analysis, all data obtained from the second source, B3, were removed from the analysis but were provided as supplemental information throughout the ''Results'' and Tables. The final model to analyze continuous data collected over time (rectal temperatures, blood cell counts, log transformed PCV2 and PRRSV genomic copies, and ELISA S/P ratios) was a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), where PRRSV strain, PCV2 subtype, DPI and their interactions were the fixed effects and pig was the subject of repeated measures. Compound symmetry variancecovariance structure was used to model the within pig correlation. A one-way ANOVA was used to analyze crosssectional data (macroscopic and microscopic lung lesions) where PRRSV strain, PCV2 subtype, and their interaction were the fixed effects. Differences among the interacting groups (PRRSV strain \u00c2 PCV2 subtype) in the repeated measures ANOVA or the one-way ANOVA were assessed using Tukey's t-test. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Differences in prevalence of PRRSV and PCV2 antigen between groups (IHC staining) were determined by Fisher's exact test.",

Interestingly, in gnotobiotic pigs the effect of the coinfection appeared additive rather than synergistic (Van Reeth and Nauwynck, 2000) .

In another study, dual infection of specific pathogen-free pigs with PRRSV and pseudorabies virus (PRV) resulted in more severe clinical signs and increased pneumonia in pigs inoculated with both viruses compared to pigs infected with PRRSV or PRV alone (Shibata et al., 2003) . It is also well recognized that PCV2 replication is enhanced by concurrent PRRSV infection in both CD and conventional pigs compared to singularly inoculated pigs (Allan et al., 2000; Rovira et al., 2002) .

Interestingly, when organized by coinfection status and analyzed by PCV2 subtype, pigs inoculated with PCV2a had significantly higher mean group rectal temperatures compared to pigs inoculated with PCV2b on dpi 9 which was associated with an anti-PCV2-antibody response in 38.9% (7/18) of the PCV2ainoculated pigs on dpi 9 whereas a delayed antibody response was seen in PCV2b-inoculated pigs (11.1%; 2/18).",

The uniqueness of the current study is the utilization of two temporally and genetically different PRRSV isolates both from cases of high morbidity and mortality in the field but isolated 15 years apart. In a separate in vitro study comparing phenotypic traits of the two PRRS viruses, NC16845b demonstrated reduced growth characteristics compared to VR-2385 (Gauger et al., 2012) . NC16845b plaque sizes were slightly smaller than VR-2385 and the peak viral titer demonstrated by NC16845b was approximately 13-fold lower than the VR-2385 peak titer. This is in contrast to the in vivo growth characteristics demonstrated in this report. There were clear differences in initial replication between the two PRRSV isolates used in this study. The VR-2385-inoculated pigs had significantly higher levels of PRRSV RNA in serum on dpi 3 and 6. Moreover, NC16845b replicated at higher levels at dpi 9 and dpi 12 compared to VR-2385 which was associated with significantly lower levels of lymphocytes at dpi 9 and a significantly lower N/L ratio at dpi 12. These results suggest that highly pathogenic PRRSVs may replicate more efficiently in vivo in contrast to their decreased growth properties in vitro as previously suggested (Johnson et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2008) . This is further supported by the data obtained from the pigs infected with PRRSV alone (B2 and B3) which clearly show an increase in replication in pigs infected with NC16845b in the later stages of the in vivo study.",

Recently, it has been shown that pigs infected with VR-2385 had significantly prolonged (until 70 DPI) PCV2 viremia and shedding in PRRSV-PCV2 coinfected pigs (Sinha et al., 2011) . A similar approach using PRRSV NC16845b, which replicated differently from VR-2385 in the early stages of infection, could potentially offer new insights on viral interactions in pigs. In the current study, PCV2b replication was significantly up-regulated shortly after initiation of the study at dpi 3 compared to PCV2a. Furthermore, the CoI-92-2b group had significantly higher quantities of PCV2b in the serum compared to CoI-06-2a (dpi 3 and 12) and CoI-06-2b (dpi 12) which was associated with a higher prevalence of PCV2 antigen in tissues (93.8% versus 75.0%) indicating a synergistic relationship between PRRSV-1992 (VR-2385) and PCV2. Unlike previous studies where the average trial length ranged from 21 to 32 days (Allan et al., 2000; Rovira et al., 2002) , this trial was terminated at dpi 12 to evaluate PRRSV-induced lung lesions which tend to be most severe between dpi 10 and dpi 14. It remains unknown if the observed trend would have resulted in a difference in clinical disease in the later stages of infection. As expected, and similar to a previous study , the pathological lesions associated with PCV2 were either not present or they were mild; however, PCV2 antigen was detected in most tissues in coinfected pigs. In this study, PCV2 na\u00efve pigs were utilized, thus the relevance of the model to actual field situations is limited considering the majority of young pigs have high levels of passively acquired anti-PCV2 antibodies (Opriessnig et al., 2004b) . Therefore, the impact of anti-PCV2 immunity on the PCV2 infection could not be ascertained in the experiment; however, this was not a major concern as we know from several experiments that pigs with passively derived antibodies, although protected from clinical PCV2 associated disease, can still be infected with PCV2 (McKeown et al., 2005; Opriessnig et al., 2008a) . Therefore, we believe that a PCV2 na\u00efve pig model increases the ability to identify trends and associations between PRRSV and PCV2.",

While this is also applicable to the current study, we attempted to minimize this risk, by using a relatively low passage of both viruses with a pig passage followed by only two in vitro passages in MARC-145 cells. Inoculation was completed two days after weaning and transport of the pigs to the research facility. It is also possible that the stress from weaning, transport, new socialization, and adjusting to a new environment may have affected the ability of the pigs to respond to concurrent PRRSV-PCV2 infection and influenced the level of PRRSV replication in the pigs. However, the data obtained from pigs infected with PRRSV alone indicate that this was not the case and that the ability of the pigs to develop a humoral immune response was normal.",

Differences in in vivo replication kinetics were identified. VR-2385 initially replicated more quickly and to higher levels and peaked at dpi 6 and the amount of VR-2385 RNA steadily declined thereafter. In contrast, pigs infected with NC16845b had lower levels of PRRSV RNA in serum initially and this steadily increased through termination of the study at dpi 12. Concurrent PCV2 viremia was enhanced by PRRSV VR-2385 infection but not by concurrent PRRSV NC16845b infection. A higher prevalence of PCV2 antigen was demonstrated in the lungs of pigs coinfected with VR-2385 (83.3%) compared to pigs coinfected with PRRSV NC16845b (66.7%). This work further emphasizes in vivo replication differences among PRRSV strains and the importance of coinfecting pathogens on PRRSV kinetics. Additional investigations are necessary to further elucidate the specific mechanisms of the PCV2-PRRSV interaction in pigs.",
