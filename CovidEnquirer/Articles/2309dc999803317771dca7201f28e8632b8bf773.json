The extracted turning point of the infections in Hubei is the 17th day, namely, Feb. 6, 2020. The epidemic in Hubei is predicted to end after Mar. 10, 2020. We estimated that the epidemic is to end up with a total of 39, 0 0 0 infections in Hubei, not including the clinically diagnosed cases since Feb. 12, which may enlarge the prediction by 1.4 times. With considered data, namely, data from Jan. 20 to Feb. 11, the average errors are bout 166 and 190 for the fits to describe the daily and cumulative infections in Hubei, respectively, corresponding to 8.6% and 1.6% for the average relative errors, respectively. Fig. 2 (b) and (e) shows the estimations of the total and daily deaths in Hubei. The predicted turning point is Feb. 12, 2020. The total deaths is estimated to be 2250. Notice the distribution of the daily deaths is delayed about 5 \u223c6 days compared with the that of the daily infections. The average errors are bout 4 and 22 for the model to describe the daily and cumulative death numbers, respectively, corresponding to the relative errors 8.6% and 6.2%, respectively.",
