In the practice of psychosomatic medicine, legal issues may arise for many reasons. For example, the treatment of patients with psychiatric illness may focus particular attention on sensitive issues such as confidentiality and the limits thereof. Second, medical and surgical colleagues often consult psychiatrists for legal and quasi-legal questions such as a patient's decision-making capacity and treatment refusal, perhaps because these issues involve assessment of mental reasoning and abnormal behavior [1] . Finally, medicine is practiced in the context of an increasingly complex society with competing values and interests, and these tensions often emerge at the level of the individual patient. Examples include cases of risk of harm to third parties and malpractice liability.",

This article will address many of the legal issues commonly encountered in psychosomatic medicine, including confidentiality, capacity and competency, informed consent, treatment refusal, substitute decision making, and malpractice. Overall, however, it is most important for physicians to recognize that the best way to avoid entanglements with the law is through the consistent provision of sound clinical care to their patients.",

In reaching this conclusion, the court relied on a balancing analysis of patients' rights to privacy and the public interest, ''The Court recognizes the public interest in supporting effective treatment of mental illness and in protecting the rights of patients to privacy.

Many states have passed statutes that address the duty to protect third parties, and others have either limited the scope of or eliminated the duty [10, 11] . State statutes generally limit the circumstances in which a duty to protect arises. For example, state law may require a specific threat to an identifiable third party, a known history of violence on the part of the patient, and/or a reasonable reason to anticipate violence. In addition, state laws may also delineate the measures that may be taken to discharge the duty to warn, such as notifying police or other law enforcement agencies, hospitalizing a patient, or warning the potential victim. One state that employs this approach is Massachusetts [12] .",

In these jurisdictions, the psychiatric consultant may have a legal obligation to warn a third party beyond that of the physician requesting the consultation. In some situations, the psychiatrist's duty to warn might even run counter to competing legal requirements for the primary treatment team [12] [13] [14] . For example, Massachusetts requires physicians, in general, to keep HIV-related information confidential, but also imposes a duty to protect on psychiatrists. In the case of an HIV-positive individual who is putting an unknowing sexual partner at risk, medical and surgical physicians are bound by the HIV confidentiality statute, whereas psychiatrists have competing obligations under the HIV and Tarasoff-inspired statutes.",

In fact, one of the historic precedents that the Tarasoff court used in its reasoning was the existence of mandated reporting of certain communicable diseases, which predated wider duties to protect third parties [7] . States and the federal government, for example, have laws regarding which communicable diseases must be reported to state authorities and/or the Centers for Disease Control. Common examples include varicella, hepatitis, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and HIV, but the list of reportable infectious diseases is generally lengthy so physicians should be aware of the requirements in the jurisdictions in which they practice [15] [16] [17] . Especially regarding HIV, jurisdictions vary regarding what information must be reported, whether reporting is anonymous, whether written permission is required to release information, and whether spousal notification is required [14, 16, 17] . In addition, doctors have been held civilly liable in cases both predating and since Tarasoff for failure to disclose a patient's infectious disease status that led to the infection of other individuals [18] [19] [20] [21] .",

Confidentiality is a cornerstone of the doctorpatient relationship and, as such, breaches for any reason should be carefully considered. Clinicians should always limit the amount of information disclosed to the minimum necessary to achieve the purpose of the disclosure and attempt to make clinical interventions, such as hospitalization of the patient or otherwise engaging the patient in a safe plan, before resorting to releasing information to any third party [24] .",

The implementation of HIPAA addressed these concerns by allowing covered entities to release protected health information for the purposes of treatment, payment, and health care operations without specific authorization or consent by the patient [32] . This decision by lawmakers to abolish the consent requirement for the release of patient medical information raised concern among advocates of medical privacy, who worried that the new era of medical information management would progressively eclipse patient confidentiality in the interest of furthering the administrative and operational needs of the modern health care system [34] [35] [36] .",

The legal equivalent of capacity is competency, which is a judicial determination. In the eyes of the law, all adults are presumed competent [1, [38] [39] [40] .",

Because different tasks require different abilities, information, and levels of understanding, the first step in making a capacity determination is to ask the basic question, ''Capacity for what?'' An understanding of the type of decision the patient is faced with-for example, accepting or refusing a recommended procedure, refusing all treatment, refusing or accepting placement-allows the consultant to assess the degree to which the patient understands the particular information relevant to the decision.",

The second element, factual understanding, may be assessed by asking if the patient has attained knowledge of the nature of the illness, the treatment options, the prognosis with and without treatment, and the risks and benefits of treatment. In determining whether a patient has a factual understanding or is capable of developing one, it is critical to ascertain what efforts have been made by the treating physicians and other staff to educate the patient about the proposed treatment. A patient who has never been informed about the proposed treatment cannot be expected to know the relevant medical information.

Appreciation goes beyond the facts; it requires the patient to achieve a broad perspective on the risks and benefits of accepting or refusing a proposed intervention and to demonstrate an understanding of the implications the decision will have for his or her future. Last, the patient must demonstrate that his or her decision-making process is a rational one. This element takes into account the patient's past preferences and life decisions, and focuses not on the rationality of the final decision but on the process by which the patient arrived at the final decision. For example, in the case of a Jehovah's Witness who would certainly live with a blood transfusion but certainly die without it, the decision to reject the blood transfusion might, on its face, seem irrational. However, the decision conceptualized in the context of the individual's life of faith and belief that acceptance of such treatment would be contrary to religious doctrine, would be considered a rational one.",

Even though the term informed consent is used, patients' refusal of treatment must also be informed. The concept of informed consent has been a cornerstone of medical treatment since the 1960s, and grew out of the broader concept of autonomy before it appeared in the medical context [43, 44] . Informed consent is the process by which the patient agrees to allow the physician or other treater to do something to or for him or her. Informed consent is not just signing a form; instead, the emphasis should be on the process of communication, information exchange, and acceptance or rejection of the proposed intervention by the patient [40] .",

The standard for what information is required for consent to be knowing or intelligent varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. There are two general approaches to determining how much information a physician must present to a patient for consent given by that patient to meet the knowing criteria [40] . The first, known as the ''reasonable professional standard,'' is clinician-focused. The second, known as the ''reasonable patient standard,'' is patient-focused. The reasonable professional standard is followed by a small majority of states. This approach requires clinicians to provide the amount of information to the patient that a reasonable professional would provide under the same or similar circumstances. On the other hand, the reasonable patient standard employed by a substantial minority of states requires clinicians to provide the amount of information that would be used by a reasonable or average patient in making an informed decision. Some states employing the patient-centered approach go further, requiring an inquiry into what information the particular patient would find material or relevant in making thi sparticular decision [49] .

A patient may waive consent and opt to defer to the judgment of the clinician or another individual, but it should be well documented that the patient has the capacity to waive informed consent [42] . In the case of therapeutic privilege, a physician may proceed with a proposed intervention by getting consent from an alternate decision maker if the consent process itself would contribute to a worsening of the patient's condition [48, 64] . Therapeutic privilege does not apply, however, in a situation where providing information to the patient might make the patient less likely to accept treatment. Overall, therapeutic privilege and waiver are extremely narrow categories, and represent exceptions to the doctrine of informed consent that should be used in only the most carefully considered, well-defined circumstances.",

An advance directive is a document crafted by an individual to appoint a substitute decision maker or give instructions about how to make future decisions should the person become incapacitated and unable to make his or her own decisions in the future. Two common types of advance directives are the health care proxy and the durable power of attorney. They are both characterized by the presence of a ''springing clause.'' That is, the documents take no effect until a future time when a patient is deemed to lack decision-making ability. When such a time comes, the documents ''spring'' or become active, and the terms of the advance directive are activated. Advance directives may have an instructional component directing further care in the event of future incapacity, appoint a substitute decision maker, or be a hybrid with an instructional component and appointment of a substitute decision maker.",

Some states, such as Illinois, have statutes that govern how to appoint substitute decision makers in the absence of an advance directive [67] . In Illinois, in the event that an incapacitated person has no advance directive, the law gives the highest priority to the patient's guardian, followed by spouse, adult child, and then parent as the order in which another individual should be appointed as a substitute decision maker, and then continues along progressively more distant blood relatives, ending with a close friend or the guardian of the estate [67] .",

This practice may also be employed for other treatment decisions, depending on the jurisdiction [14, 40] . However, as proposed treatments become increasingly intrusive, aggressive, or risky, the need for a formally designated substitute decision maker increases. State statutes and case law may determine whether a formal mechanism such as guardianship or court approval is required for a particular intervention. Depending on the jurisdiction and the proposed intervention, such formal mechanisms may be required even when the treating physician believes the intervention is routine. One example is the use of antipsychotic medications in Massachusetts [68].",

First, it must be established that a doctor-patient relationship existed, which imposed a duty of reasonable care on the physician with regard to the patient. Second, it must be shown that the physician breached that duty. Third, it must be shown that the breach, or dereliction, of the duty directly caused the patient's harm. Fourth, it must be shown that the patient suffered damage as a result of the physician's actions or inactions [1, 39, 52, 69] .

However, once consultants cross the boundary between advising the consultee and actually providing treatment to the patient, the consultant owes the patient the same standard of care as the treating physician. For example, if the consultant recommends that the consultee prescribe a medication to the patient, the duty is to the consultee. However, if the consultant enters the order and actually prescribes the medication to the patient, the consultant will be held to the level of care of a treating physician. It is thus important for the consultant to be aware of his or her role in the treatment of the patient, and to maintain clear division of tasks with the consultee regarding all psychiatric interventions in the care of the patient. Additionally, if the consultant does assume a treating role, then he or she should be cognizant of the need to monitor and follow-up on the patient as if he or she is the primary treating psychiatrist.",
