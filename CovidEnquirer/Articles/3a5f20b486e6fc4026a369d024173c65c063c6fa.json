In experimental animals (primates, rats, and mice), VSV has been shown to lead to neurotoxicities, such as hind limb paralysis. The virus matrix protein (M) and glycoprotein (G) are both major pathogenic determinants of wild-type VSV and have been the major targets for the production of attenuated strains. Existing strategies for attenuation included: (1) deletion or M51R substitution in the M protein (VSV M51 or VSVM51R, respectively); (2) truncation of the C-terminus of the G protein (G 28). Despite these mutations, recombinant VSV with mutated M protein is only moderately attenuated in animals, whereas there are no detailed reports to determine the pathogenicity of recombinant VSV with truncated G protein at high dose. Thus, a novel recombinant VSV (VSV M51-G 28) as well as other attenuated VSVs (VSV M51, VSV-G 28) were produced to determine their efficacy as vaccine vectors with low pathogenicity. In vitro studies indicated that truncated G protein (G 28) could play a more important role than deletion of M51 ( M51) for attenuation of recombinant VSV. VSV M51-G 28 was determined to be the most attenuated virus with low pathogenicity in mice, with VSV-G 28 also showing relatively reduced pathogenicity. Further, neutralizing antibodies stimulated by VSV-G 28 proved to be significantly higher than in mice treated with VSV M51-G 28. In conclusion, among different attenuated VSVs with mutated M and/or G proteins, recombinant VSV with only truncated G protein (VSV-G 28) demonstrated ideal balance between pathogenesis and stimulating a protective immune response. These properties make VSV-G 28 a promising vaccine vector and vaccine candidate for preventing vesicular stomatitis disease.",

The plasmid pVSV M51 was kindly provided by Prof. John Bell (Univ. of Ottawa, Canada). The pVSV XN2 and helper plasmids, pBS-N, P, L, were provided by Prof. Glen Barber's Lab (Univ. of Miami, USA). The pVSV-G 28 and pVSV M51-G 28 were constructed based on pVSV XN2 and pVSV M51, respectively. In the constructs, the wild-type VSV G protein cytoplasmic tail (29 aa) was truncated with only one arginine residue remaining in the tail (G 28) (Fig. 1 ). The forward primer used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of G 28 was: 5 -CCGGAGCGCTATGAAGTGCCTTTTGTACTTA-3 (underlined indicates the MluI restriction site), and the reverse primer was: 5 -CC-GGCTCGAGCGTGATATCTGTTAGTTTTTTTCATACCTAGCAGGATTTG-AGTCATTATCGGGAGAACCAAGAATAG-3 (underlined indicates the XhoI restriction site and bold residues indicate the two tandem repeat stop codons). To construct pVSV-G 28 or pVSV M51-G 28, VSV G gene of pVSV XN2 or pVSV M51 was substituted with G 28 by restriction digestion with MluI and XhoI. All the start/stop signals for viral gene transcription were preserved. A schematic representation of pVSV M51-G 28 is shown in Fig. 1 .",

To quantify the relationship between amount of VSV-induced type I IFN and viral replication titers, multicycle growth curves were performed with inoculation of viruses at low MOI of 0.01. As shown in Fig. 5a , titers of VSV M51-G 28 reached the highest levels at 24 h p.i., but only around 5 \u00d7 10 3 PFU/mL and decline thereafter. VSV M51 also reached the IFN-\u2424 levels in VSV-treated PC3 cells were quantified at 24 h p.i. to identify the role by type I IFNs. In different recombinant VSV-infected PC3 cells, induction of IFN-\u2424 was inversely correlated with viral replication titers. As shown in Fig. 5b , the high levels of IFN \u2424 were induced in M51 VSV-treated cells. In VSV M51 infected cells, IFN-\u2424 concentrations reached \u223c2000 pg/mL, but the highest replication titer was \u223c2 orders of magnitude lower than for VSV XN2 . Although IFN-\u2424 production in VSV M51-G 28 treated cells was as low as \u223c300 pg/mL, this was still significantly higher than VSV XN2 (p < 0.05). IFN-\u2424 detected in the supernatants of VSV-G 28 treated cells was below the limit of detection for the assay. Therefore, viral attenuation showed the following trends: VSV XN2 > VSV M51 > VSV-G 28 > VSV M51-G 28. Importantly, the fact that M51 led to attenuation of VSV through the induction of antiviral IFNs was proved again in our study.",

In VSV-G 28 groups, antibody titers were 320-640 at a vaccination dose of 10 3 PFU and 640-1280 at 10 4 PFU.

Based on these results, it could be concluded that VSV-G 28 could stimulate a more potent protective humoral immune response than VSV M51-G 28, which might be due to the extreme attenuation of VSV M51-G 28 in vivo.

Both VSV-G 28 and VSV M51-G 28 have demonstrated significant attenuation compared to VSV XN2 or VSV M51, which are considered safe as vaccine vectors. However, we sought to determine which attenuated virus would work better in stimulating potent protective immunities that are critical for their clinical applications. To evaluate protective immunities stimulated by VSV-G 28 and VSV M51-G 28, animals were immunized with different doses of viruses and then challenged with a lethal dose of VSV XN2 , which is the \"gold standard\" to evaluate efficacy of a VSV vaccine. As shown in the current study, VSV-G 28 could stimulate more potent protective immunities than VSV M51-G 28. Of note, VSV-G 28 treated animals inoculated with a low 10 3 PFU dose, no deaths or significant body weight losses were observed post-challenge with VSV XN2 . However, animals in VSV M51-G 28 treated group suffered serious body weight loss even when immunized with 10 4 PFU and some Table 2 Serum neutralizing antibody titers in mice against VSV Indianna after inoculation with VSV-G 28 or VSV M51-G 28. Animals were inoculated with 10 3 or 10 4 PFU of different VSVs with PBS as a control. Sera were collected before and 21 days after inoculation. Neutralizing antibody titers against VSV Indiana were determined and expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of antibody giving a 100% inhibition of cytopathic effect. '-': not detectable. animals died when the dose was as low as 10 3 PFU. The results correlated with neutralization antibody titers stimulated by different VSVs. Neutralization antibodies titers in animals vaccinated with VSV-G 28 were shown to be much higher than those with VSV M51-G 28. Therefore, although VSV M51-G 28 contained the double mutated M and G proteins and was a very safe viral vector, it was not as effective as VSV-G 28 in stimulating protective immunity, possibly due to its extreme attenuation in vivo.",

For the first time, VSV with mutated M and/or G proteins (VSV M51, VSV-G 28, VSV M51-G 28) were compared to evaluate their potentials as vaccine vectors. The experimental conclusions included: (1) both G 28 and M51 contribute to the attenuation of VSV, however, G 28 is likely to play a more important role than M51. VSV M51-G 28 was determined to show the most significant attenuation in vitro. (2) Virulence of recombinant VSVs with truncated G protein (VSV-G 28, VSV M51-G 28) significantly decreased compared with wild-type VSV or VSV M51. (3) VSV-G 28 could stimulate a more potent protective immune response than VSV M51-G 28 possibly due to the extreme attenuation of VSV M51-G 28. Among different attenuated VSVs with mutated M and/or G proteins, recombinant VSV with only truncated G protein (VSV-G 28) displayed an ideal balance between pathogenesis and stimulation of a protective immune response that could be used as a promising vaccine vector.",

The M protein with M51 impaired the ability of the protein to inhibit the transportation of host mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm resulting in the induction of type I IFNs to protect the neighboring cells from infection. Thus, Evaluation of pathogenesis caused by different recombinant VSVs in BALB/c mice measured by body weight loss and survival curve. Animals were divided into five groups and infected intranasally with 10 7 PFU VSVXN2, VSV M51, VSV-G 28 or VSV M51-G 28, with the control group inoculated with PBS. (a) Mice were weighed daily before and after inoculation. The graph represents average body weights changes (%) \u00b1standard error of the mean (SEM) for each group. (b) Survival curves of VSVXN2 treated mice indicated suffered serious body weight loss and all died 6 days post-inoculation, mice in VSV M51 treated group also lost weight seriously and 40% of animals died, whereas in VSV-G 28 or VSV M51-G 28 treated groups, no pathogenesis such as serious body weight loss or death were observed.
