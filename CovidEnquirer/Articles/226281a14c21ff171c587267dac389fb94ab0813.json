            "text": "Ap 4 A hydrolase is responsible for metabolizing the ''allarmone'' nucleotide Ap 4 A and is therefore involved in all the above biological processes. Recent evidence further implicates that the SARS-CoV 7a protein interacts with human Ap 4 A-hydrolase and may participate in common pathways leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [15] . Ap 4 A hydrolase belongs to Nudix (nucleoside diphosphate linked to X) hydrolases, a superfamily of Mg 2+ -dependent enzymes which catalyze the hydrolysis of nucleoside diphosphates linked to other moieties, X, and contains the conserved Nudix sequnce GX 5 EX 7 REUXEEXGU (where U represents a bulky aliphatic residue usually Ile, Leu or Val, and X represents any resi-due) [16] . It is characterized as cleaving the polyphosphate chain at the fourth phosphate from the bound adenosine moiety. According to phylogenetic analysis [17] , Ap 4 A hydrolases were classified into two distinct groups, animal-archaeal type and plant-bacterial type enzymes. The latter contain loop insertions that undergo a large translation on substrate binding and exhibit substantial dynamic changes [18] . Previous studies of Ap 4 A structures from both groups revealed that the enzyme has the aba-sandwich architecture of a Nudix fold [18] [19] [20] . However, these studies suggest that important differences exist in the binding sites between animal-archaeal type and plant-bacterial type enzymes. According to the analysis of the NMR structure of human Ap 4 A hydrolase (E58A), a proposal suggests recognition trigger is not required as the side chains of some key residues are on average predisposed with the correct orientation to unite key interactions for binding [19] .",

Cells were grown at 310 K in Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 lg/mL ampicillin and were harvested and sonicated in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 8.0 containing 150 mM NaCl. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 g for 30 min. The soluble fraction was applied to nickel-chelating resin (Amersham Biosciences) preequilibrated with equilibration buffer [ The eluate was exchanged to low-salt non-imidazole buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 20 mM NaCl) and was further purified by chromatography on a MonoQ anion ion-exchange column (GE Healthcare). The target protein was eluted using a linear gradient of 20-800 mM NaCl in 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, and then was applied to a gel filtration column (16/60 Superdex 200, GE Healthcare) in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 8.0 containing 150 mM NaCl. The flow-through fraction, which contained the target protein, was buffer exchanged with crystallization buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 20 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT) and concentrated for crystallization assays to 10 mg/mL by centrifugal ultrafiltration (Millipore). The protein concentration was determined by Bradford method (Bio-Rad Protein Assay), using bovine serum albumin as standard. The presence and purity of the recombinant protein was then analyzed on SDS-PAGE (better than 95% purity) and was judged to be suitable for crystallization.",

In the E58A-DPO structure, one phosphate group of DPO was observed in the relevant position in Chain B, and forms the similar binding mode with the protein, while the other phosphate group, which may be the b-phosphate of the substrate, makes hydrogen binds to Lys42 NZ.

In monomer A, the equivalent position is most likely a sulfate although a water molecule was modeled in the density. In contrast, there is no relevant density in this region in monomers C and D, and the residues His44 and Glu110 show a different conformation compared to that in monomers A and B. In addition, inspection of the active site shows there is sufficient flexibility in the location of b-and c-phosphates between the two sulfate ions sites. Thus, this sulfate position is most likely close to the substrate d-phosphate binding site. Consequently, the sulfate is at a distance of about 3.8$5 \u00c5 from some other Nudix signature sequence residues Arg57, Clu61 and Glu62. Probably due to the lack of magnesium ions, this sulfate Helices and strands are shown as bars and arrows, respectively. Topology diagrams were generated with Topdraw [33] .

This observation of the sulfate would suggest these residues (His44, Arg57, Glu58, Clu61, Glu62 and Glu110) are sufficient to stabilize the substrate and orientate the d-phosphate by hydrogen bond or via metal coordination for nuclophilic attack.",
