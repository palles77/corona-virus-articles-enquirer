            "text": "Technological advances in the field of technical or high performance textiles have made it possible to engineer materials designed to meet specific needs. However, there is no`ideal' fabric that will provide protection against all hazards. Careful selection of appropriate textiles is crucial for the performance, use, care, and maintenance of protective clothing. Broadly, a clear understanding of the work environment and performance requirements as well as knowledge of the textiles, is essential for the decision making process. According to the OSHA Technical Manual,`In general, the greater the level of chemical protective clothing, the greater the associated risks. For any given situation, equipment and clothing should be selected that provide an adequate level of protection. Overprotection as well as under-protection can be hazardous and should be avoided'. 1 The above statements are also applicable to other types of protective clothing. Heat, physical and psychological stress, as well as reduced dexterity and mobility, are examples of additional hazards that may be a result of the use of protective clothing. In addition to protection, the selection of textiles takes into consideration factors such as the impact of protective clothing on job performance; comfort; durability; availability and cost; use, care, and maintenance, and cultural factors. To select protective clothing materials, relevant factors have to be identified and prioritized in a multi-step process. It is imperative that such a holistic approach be taken while selecting materials for protective clothing. Basing the decision on just the performance properties of the material may result in low user acceptance. For example, a glove that protects a surgeon may be rejected if it hinders the surgeon's ability to operate effectively.",

Hazards and scenarios to assist in the selection of materials are very well defined in some sectors, but in other sectors there may not be such well defined scenarios. In general, well defined risk scenarios and performance specifications based on the risks are available for sectors where the use of protective clothing is crucial for the safety of the individuals. For example, selection of protective clothing for firefighters and police is based upon well developed scenarios and requirements. With increased risk of terror attacks, the work scenarios for police and firefighters have changed in countries such as the United States, and the new risks impact the guidelines, standards, and selection of protective clothing materials. These new risks may also require the development of new materials that provide additional protection to such individuals. With the change in work scenario, firefighters and other professionals who are now categorized as`first responders' need protection against other hazards. The United States Department of Homeland Security has adopted personal protective equipment (PPE) standards developed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) to protect first responders against chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive (CBRNE) threats.",

Ballistic protection is required to protect individuals from bullets. Bullets may also cause blunt trauma injury by deforming the body armor. Thus, body armor designed to protect individuals is evaluated for ballistic protection as well as the ability to prevent blunt trauma injury. Puncture or stab resistance is required to protect individuals from sharp objects such as knives, as well as comparatively blunt objects commonly used by inmates in correctional facilities. In addition to the above mentioned hazards, protection against abrasion is also used as a criterion for selecting the material. Protection against multiple physical hazards is commonly required for individuals in the military, police force or correctional institutions. Body armor is commonly used to provide protection against physical hazards.

Although there are ratings or classifications for the various types of hazards, there is no universal system to rate the severity of all hazards. In the future, there may be a system to assess the severity and rate it regardless of the type of hazard. For example, the extremely hazardous category may be defined to include all hazard scenarios that are life threatening in very small amounts. Thus, the extremely hazardous category may include SARS and anthrax from the biological category, nerve gas from chemical, ballistic from physical, and radioactive materials from radiological hazards. This type of rating would help in the testing and selection of PPE materials.

Knowledge of the performance specifications and standards is essential. Often companies that manufacture materials and protective clothing may have to comply with more than one set of requirements, as these may vary by geographic locations. For example, due to differences in minimum specifications as well as the required test methods, garments may meet the requirements in the United States but not in the European Union or vice versa. Thus, it is not unusual to find different products being marketed by the same manufacturer in different countries. The specificity of the regulations and standards varies considerably. They range from very clearly defined selection, use, care, and maintenance criteria for personal protective equipment (PPE) to requirements in which the employer is responsible for providing`appropriate protective clothing.' In some cases there is either no performance standard or guideline, or they are in the process of being established. Given below are examples of standards and specifications for different scenarios and the impact they have on the selection process for the particular hazard. 7 These standards have clearly defined test methods and minimum requirements that assist in the selection of protective clothing materials. The manufacturers of the materials often provide data to guide product selection.

For example, face masks or respirators with different filters are used to protect individuals against exposure due to inhalation. Chemical protective clothing is used to protect against dermal exposure. Chemical protective clothing materials are broadly divided into woven; nonwoven; laminated to microporous or hydrophilic membranes; coated, bonded, or laminated with plastic films or rubber; and films, sheets, or moulded plastic or rubber. The performance of the chemical protective materials varies considerably based on the air permeability, chemical composition, and material characteristics. Penetration, permeation, and/or degradation of the materials are measured to determine the chemical resistance. In general, the physical form of the chemical that poses a potential risk and the type of material determine whether penetration, permeation, and/or degradation tests have to be conducted. Permeation is`the process by which a chemical moves through a protective clothing material on a molecular level. Permeation involves (i) sorption of molecules of the chemical into the contacted (challenge side) surface of the material; (ii) diffusion of the sorbed molecules in the material, and (iii) desorption of the molecules from the opposite surface of the material'. 15 The permeation rate and breakthrough time are important for measuring permeation. Permeation tests are conducted to determine the performance of non-porous materials such as monolithic films against volatile and non-volatile liquids and gases. It is not used to measure the performance of woven or knitted fabrics. For such porous materials, penetration tests are used to measure performance. Penetration is defined as the`process by which a solid, liquid, or gas moves through closures, seams, interstices, and pinholes or other imperfections on a non-molecular level, in a protective clothing material or item.' 15 Penetration through a material can be measured by several national and international standards. The selection of a suitable standard depends on the exposure scenario. For example, there are three national and international test methods to measure the penetration of pesticide through textiles. 14 Degradation is defined as`a deleterious change in one or more properties of a material'. 15 Materials that have degraded due to chemical exposure, use or exposure to environmental conditions such as sunlight should be discarded, as these affect the fabric performance.",
