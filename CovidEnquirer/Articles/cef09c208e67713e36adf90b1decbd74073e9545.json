Methods: We performed a classroom-based cluster randomization at a kindergarten school in Bangkok, Thailand. A total of 1437 children were placed into 3 test groups, based on the frequency of alcohol hand gel use for hand hygiene: only before lunch (q lunch), every 120 minutes (q 120), and every 60 minutes (q 60). The primary outcome was a change in the school absenteeism rate caused by ILI. Results: The rates of absenteeism from confirmed ILI (sick days/present days) were 0.026 in the q lunch group, 0.025 in the q 120 group, and 0.017 in the q 60 group. Significant reductions in absenteeism rates were seen when comparing the q 60 group with the q 120 group (rate difference, 0.009; 95% confidence interval [CI], \u00c00.002 to 0.015; P \u00bc .008) and comparing the q 60 group with the q lunch group (rate difference, 0.0096; 95% CI, 0.004-0.016; P \u00bc .002). No such differences were detected between the q 120 and q lunch groups (rate difference, 0.001; 95% CI, 0.005-0.007; P \u00bc .743). Conclusions: The compulsory hourly use of alcohol gel as classroom hand disinfection could significantly reduce the rate of absenteeism from ILI in preschool-age children.",

The acceptability of facemasks in Thailand was low compared with that in several other countries. 17 In contrast, the application of alcohol hand gel was already widely accepted as a convenient and effective disinfection agent for ILI that reduces viral inoculation, replication, and transmission from contaminated hands. [18] [19] [20] The alcohol hand gel formulation used in this study provided broader antibacterial activity against grampositive and gram-negative bacteria, as well as a longer sustained antibacterial effect, compared with commercially available products in the United States, which typically contain 60% ethanol, with no chlorhexidine or Irgasan. 21, 22 This could limit the generalizability of our findings to other countries. Compulsory hand disinfection of entire classrooms at prespecified intervals helped ensure compliance of each intervention group. During the study period, no adverse reactions to alcohol hand gel was reported, even in the children as young as 20 months. \"Alcohol hand gel round\" seemed to be an enjoyable activity for the children. Moreover, the application process for the children in the classroom was usually brief and did not disturb the regular classroom schedule. The cost of the use of alcohol hand gel every 60 minutes was $6.39 per child per 12-week period; however, the effect size of the intervention was substantial, considering the reduced rate of absenteeism for ILI and the associated lost time from work for parents and costs related to doctor visits and antibiotic prescriptions.",

One possible explanation for the inconsistency between the primary and secondary outcomes is misclassification of large numbers of cases due to the lack of diagnostic testing. Especially in those children who did not visit a doctor, allergy symptoms could have been easily misclassified during the telephone interview (the baseline data show that 37.37% of the students reported an allergic disorders as the underlying disease), as well as those who had ILI that attended school regardless of being ill or not. Likewise, we cannot definitively state that the observed reduction in absenteeism is the direct effect of the school disinfection program; however, randomization should account for unknown confounders. Another limitation is that the study was conducted in a single school system in which most families were middle-to-high socioeconomic status; our results might not be applicable to other schools.",
