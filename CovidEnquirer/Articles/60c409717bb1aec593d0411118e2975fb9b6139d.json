This paper proposes a simulation-based method to evaluate the probability of energy saving shortfall taking into account the variations in the influential parameters, including weather conditions, occupancy, operating hours, thermostat set-point, etc., during the contract period. The proposed method involves the use of a detailed building energy simulation programme, sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simulation techniques. Empirical data is also used to develop the probability distribution functions for the identified parameters to simulate the actual yearly variations in the post-retrofit conditions. A real case study of replacement of heat rejection system for a central chiller plant in Hong Kong is used to demonstrate the application of this probabilistic method. The result shows that the possible energy savings after a 1-year retrofit period ranges from 393,000 kW h (2.86%) to 1098,000 kW h (10.8%) with 90% statistical significance.",

            "text": "Buildings account for 40% of the world's energy use, and most of the existing buildings are not so energy efficient as modern technology allows [1, 2] . As such, energy retrofitting of existing building services equipment can yield significant amount of energy savings. However, the lack of upfront capital and technological know-how are usually hurdles to undertaking energy improvement projects although the benefits of such works, for example, a substantial reduction in utility costs and improvement of the built environment, are obvious. Energy Performance Contracting (EPC) is recognised as a means to tackle this problem in many countries, including the United States, Australia, Germany, Japan, Singapore and China [3, 4] . The European Parliament defines EPC in the Directive 2006/32/EC as \"a contractual arrangement between the beneficiary and the provider (normally an ESCO) of an energy efficiency improvement measure, where investments in that measure are paid for in relation to a contractually agreed level of energy efficiency improvement.\" [5] . It means that, under an EPC arrangement, energy service companies (ESCOs) guarantee or share the energy savings with building owners. Building owners only make a series of payment to ESCOs when the actual energy savings are materialised. In the case of shortfall in savings, ESCOs will compensate the loss incurred by building owners. To ensure the guaranteed energy saving can be achieved, a proper assessment method on the probability of energy saving shortfall is needed to evaluate such project risks.",

[6] identified the risks associated with energyefficiency projects and classified them into five aspects, namely economic, contextual, technology, operation, and measurement and verification (M&V) risks. Several risk management approaches (e.g. financial hedging, careful design, proper metering, etc.) were also introduced to mitigate the associated risks in their study. However, even though ESCOs can better manage the performance risks by ensuring system efficiency, optimisation control and better maintenance, the actual energy saving is still uncertain. This is attributed to various extrinsic factors including weather conditions, economic circumstances, as well as occupants' behaviour, which can significantly affect the actual energy savings. For example, the occupancy rate of hotel may decrease dramatically due to economic downturn, resulting in a significant reduction in the actual energy savings. Therefore, a dilemma is often observed from the ESCOs' perspective in determining the amount of guaranteed energy savings. On one hand, ESCOs try to mitigate the performance risks by being conservative on the guaranteed savings, but on the other hand, to increase chances of winning bids by offering higher energy saving guarantee and shorter contract period.",

However, some drawbacks were found in this technique, for example, several simplified assumptions had to be made for project comparison and a number of risk factors were excluded in the analysis. Mathew et al. [8] indicated the possible use of actuarial pricing approach to quantify the associated risks for project decision-making. However, this approach requires a large number of actual EPC project data, but the non-standardised project information and poor data quality often hinder the development of a reliable actuarial database [9] . Mills et al.

With the two models, the actual energy savings can be predicted taking into account any deviation in the post-retrofit conditions from the baseline conditions. The models should be developed by using a detailed building energy simulation programme, which allows users to input all essential building information, system & equipment specifications, as well as operational characteristics for realistic energy use predictions. The two models should be basically identical except the retrofitted systems and the conditions with significant changes (e.g. change of occupancy). To ensure the representativeness of the models, the models should be calibrated with the measured energy use data. Details of the calibration procedures can be referred to other published literature and guidelines [11] [12] [13] [14] . II Sensitivity analysis: The second step is to identify the importance of influential parameters affecting energy use. In general, the influential parameters can be summarised into three categories, namely \"Building Load\", \"System Control and Operation\" and \"Equipment, System and Plant\". For the selection of influential parameters, attention should be paid to those parameters that are likely to change during the EPC contract period, for example, weather conditions, occupancy rate, operating hours, etc. Some of the influential parameters may be excluded, for example, building height, materials used in building facade, orientation, etc., since these parameters are unlikely to change during the contract period. In some projects, an exclusion clause is incorporated to protest the interest of ESCOs and hosts in case of significant changes in the baseline conditions (e.g. large scale renovation works are conducted during the contract period). Those parameters can also be discarded in the sensitivity analysis.",

This technique has been widely used by researchers to determine the most sensitive parameters affecting building energy use [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . The selection of a proper range and interval is essential to obtain accurate results in sensitivity analysis.

The selection of the representative PDF is critical in this analysis as it is used to simulate the yearly variations in those selected parameters during the post-retrofit period. Empirical data from official database and previous research are used to determine the corresponding PDF for the selected parameters using curve-fitting techniques. Three goodness-of-fit tests, namely the Chi-square test, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test, and the Anderson-Darling (A-D) test, are performed to evaluate how well the assumed distributions fit a set of sample data [21] . The Chi-square test is used to determine the validity of two or more theoretical distribution models. The K-S test serves the same purpose, but with fewer limitations in application such as a large number of intervals. The A-D test is particularly useful when the tails of a distribution reflect an essential distribution characteristic. The lower the goodness-of-fit value of these tests is, the more representative the assumed PDF is selected. For those parameters without empirical data to determine, a triangular distribution is proposed to be the representative PDF, and the most likely value should be regarded as the baseline condition.",

Monte Carlo simulation is performed to generate a common set of post-retrofit condition data based on the PDF of the selected parameters. Monte Carlo simulation is a mathematical method where output values are randomly generated based on the assumed distributions of the independent parameters. A smooth approximation of the output distribution is obtained with large sample sizes (e.g. by iterating 10,000 simulation runs). This technique has been applied in a number of probabilistic analysis [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] .The Latin Hypercube Sampling method is proposed to generate those random numbers, because it more precisely reflects the shape of a defined distribution with relative small sample sizes [26] .",

To simulate the energy saving uncertainty associated with yearly weather variations, it is necessary to modify and reproduce the typical weather file 10,000 times in accordance with the results of each Monte Carlo simulation. The algorithm of weather adjustment for the original weather file is based on a \"morphing\" method, developed by Belcher et al. [27] who constructed design weather data for future climates. Chan [28] also adopted this morphing method to modify the Hong Kong typical meteorological year (TMY) weather file taking into accounts the effect of urban heat islands. The procedure of this method will be illustrated in the later part of this paper. Similarly, 10,000 input files are required to generate based on the result of Monte Carlo simulation. Each weather and input file represents one of the possible yearly conditions during the post-retrofit period. These weather and input files are run on the detailed energy building simulation programme for the pre-and post-retrofit models to simulate possible range of energy savings.",

As the \"indirect\" seawater supply was at much higher temperatures than the original design level, the chiller plant had been running at rather low coefficient of performance (COP). The poor quality of the seawater also exacerbated corrosion of condenser tubes, causing further lowering of the COP.

It is worth noting that the significance of the parameters may vary in different climatic conditions. For example, the ventilation rate is usually one of the most significant parameters contributing to the energy use of air-conditioning systems. However, for the Hong Kong weather conditions where four seasons are clearly distinct, the change of ventilation rate is insensitive to the total air-conditioning energy use on an annual basis because although the greater fresh air flow rate provides a larger rate of free cooling when the outdoor temperature is cool (thus reducing the energy use for air-conditioning during cool winter days), the saving would be compensated by the increase in air-conditioning energy use during hot summer days.",

However, the purpose of sensitivity analysis is to eliminate some parameters which are relatively less sensitive to energy use. The exact average IC value and ranking are not important in this study.

The K-S test was used when the sample sizes were less than 30. The Chi-square test and A-D test were employed while the sample sizes equal to 30 or more. All the calculated values from these tests were tested by the corresponding criteria values at the 5% significance level. When the calculated value is less than the critical value at the specified significance level, the assumed distribution can be declared as an acceptable model to describe sample data. For example, the observed data of dry bulb mean temperature (sample sizes = 16) was assumed to be inferred by the normal distribution. In the K-S test, the calculated value of maximum discrepancy between the assumed and observed cumulative frequencies was 0.08, which was less than the critical value of D\u02db= 0.05 n=16 = 0.33 at 5% significance level. By the K-S test, the normal distribution was verified as an acceptable model at 5% significance level for the dry bulb mean temperature parameter.

After that, the COP deteriorated at an annual average of 2.53%. The study also suggested that 7.6% of chiller performance could be recovered when preventive maintenance, such as tube chemical cleaning, is regularly performed.",

As the maintenance is part of the scope of the contract in most EPC projects, the ESCO has an incentive to ensure that the plant performance shall be maintained at the expected COP. When the plant performance is much lower than the expected COP, active maintenance, such as tube chemical cleaning, replacement of parts, would be carried out to avoid energy saving shortfall. In this case study, the existing chillers were still used after the retrofit. Based on the previous study of existing chiller performance [43] , an annual average of 2.53% COP deterioration rate was assumed for the worst case while 7.6% improvement of chiller performance will be used for the best case (assuming with high quality of maintenance work during the contract period). A triangular distribution was assumed for the PDF of COP. The most likely value in this PDF will be set equal to the existing COP. Fig. 4 illustrates the calculation procedures of 10,000 simulation runs. A risk analysis tool based on Monte Carlo simulation (@Risk) [44] was utilised to generate 10,000 common data sets of 7 input parameters for two calibrated building energy models. The purpose of generating this common data set is to simulate all the possible cases for the yearly post-retrofit period conditions taking into account the variations in these selected parameters.",

The algorithm of weather adjustment is based on a \"morphing\" method, developed by Belcher et al. [27] who constructed design weather data for future climates. The main advantage of this method is that it preserves the characteristics of standard weather pattern after modification. In the \"morphing\" method, three operations: (1) a shift; (2) a liner stretch; and (3) a shift and a stretch, as listed in Eqs. (2) to (4) are used to modify the weather file.",

In this study, the hourly dry bulb temperature (DBT) of the existing Hong Kong TMY weather file was morphed by a combination of a shift and a stretch to generate another set of Hong Kong TMY weather file. The equation for morphing is shown as follows (Eq. where dbt 0max y , dbt 0 y and dbt 0min y = yearly mean daily maximum, average and minimum temperature of EnergyPlus weather file data respectively; TMAX y , TEMP y and TMIN y = absolute change in yearly mean daily maximum, average and minimum temperature of Hong Kong weather data respectively; dbt 0 = existing hourly temperature of EnergyPlus weather file. A stretch method was adopted to adjust the current hourly dew point temperature (DPT). As required in EPW weather file, the other climatic variable-relative humidity (RH), was calculated from the hourly value of DBT and DPT using ASHRAE psychrometric formulae [35] . All the morphing processes involved above were automatically performed using Excel VBA. By using the morphing method, a set of 10,000 modified weather files was developed, taking into account the yearly weather variations.",

Based on the representative PDF of those seven influential parameters, a group of values representing one of the post-retrofit conditions is randomly generated using the Latin Hypercube Sampling method (please refer to Fig. 4 ). To instruct jEPlus running all the possible conditions of the post-retrofit period, a CSV-styled text file containing 10,000 different values of each influential parameter was created. By incorporating the calibrated energy model, TMY weather files and a CSV-styled text file, jEPlus can simultaneously perform the eight instructed simulations at maximum in each run, and the simulation results are automatically grouped together for a probabilistic analysis of actual energy savings [45] . The 20,000 EnergyPlus iterations (10,000 iterations for each model) were performed in 10 computers with two quad-core processors, taking 8 h to complete the calculation. In this demonstration, 4 timesteps per hour was used and the conduction transfer function was adopted as a heat balance algorithm in EnergyPlus. A point worth noting is that the common data set was applied to all selected parameters for both models, except the parameter \"Overall COP of chiller plant\" in the pre-retrofit model, which remains unchanged as the pre-retrofit condition.",

This suggests that the variations in actual yearly energy savings can be significant. The maximum energy savings can be 3 times higher than the minimum one. The results also provide information on the probability of energy saving shortfall when a certain amount of energy savings is anticipated. For example, only by a 46.5% chance the ESCO will successfully achieve the mean value of energy saving per year 711,054 kWh (5.18%) for the replacement of heat rejection system in this study. Further studies are needed to benchmark this sort of probability values when data on more buildings are available, but since the objective of this paper is to demonstrate a plausible methodology, it still serves its purpose.",

However, the financial benefits from EPC projects also include the avoided-cost savings, for instance, a reduction in operation and maintenance costs.
