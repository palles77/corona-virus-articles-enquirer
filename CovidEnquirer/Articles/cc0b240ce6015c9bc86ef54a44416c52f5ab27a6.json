Groups 1, 2 and 3, twice a day, were administered chitosan oligosaccharide at a dose of 100, 500, and 1000 mg/kg for 7 days, respectively, with milk replacer. In group 4, lambs with cryptosporidiosis were subjected to normal feeding as control without drug administration. Clinical examinations of lambs were made before treatment (day 0) and on days 1, 3, 5 and 7 after treatment and 5 ml of blood was collected from vena jugularis for blood analysis of all lambs. Weight changes of lambs were recorded at 0, 7, 14, and 21 days. Stool specimens were collected pre-treatment (day 0) and on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14 and 21 post-treatment to determine oocyst excretion of lambs with cryptosporidiosis. Lambs with a mean oocyte counts > 10 after stool examination were included to the treatment. Changes in clinical hematology, blood gases and biochemical parameters were observed during the course of treatment, but these changes were limited. Weight loss was observed at 7th day according to 0th day the lambs with experimental cryptosporidiosis but gradually weight increase was observed at 14th and 21st days and these changes were similar in all groups. Oocyst excretion decreased in all groups during treatment. According to 0th day, there was a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in oocyte excretions in the third day in group 1 and 2, and in day 5 in the group 3 and 4. Significant changes (p < 0.05) were observed in oocyst excretions on the third and fifth days among the groups. As a result, in lambs with experimental cryptosporidiosis, chitosan oligosaccharide improved in clinical signs and stool character shorter than the positive control group and the administration of chitosan oligosaccharide at doses of 100, 500 and 1000 mg/kg for 7 days significantly reduced oocyst excretion but not enough to remove cryptosporidiosis completely.",

            "text": "Infection caused by Cryptosporidium parvum is common among young ruminants and is seen in various mammalians including humans. The disease has a high prevalence across the world and is among the important causes of diarrhea in neonatal farm animals (Scott, 2007; Paraud and Chartier, 2012; Constable et al., 2017) . C. parvum is one of the primary causes of diarrhea seen in young lambs and goats. Diarrhea can develop as a result of C. parvum infection alone; however, it mostly develops due to mixed infection. Infection can occur as a severe diarrhea outbreak which can cause high mortality in lambs aged 4-10 days (Zorana et al., 2006; Goma et al., 2007; Paraud and Chartier, 2012; Constable et al., 2017) . There is no specific treatment for cryptosporidiosis. It has been reported that paromomycin, lasalocid, halofuginone lactate, sulfoxinoxalin, azithromycin and toltrazuril have partial or demonstrable effect against in neonatal ruminants with cryptosporidiosis (Viu et al., 2000; Wright and Coop, 2007; Giadinis et al., 2008; Navarre et al., 2012; Yagci et al., 2017; Aydogdu et al., 2018) .",

            "text": "Chitosan is a natural polysaccharide produced by deacetylation of chitin. It is non-toxic, biocompatible and biodegradable (Huang et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2018) . Chitin is the main component of crustaceans (crab, shrimp, etc.) and is also found in skeletons of insects and cell walls of fungi. There are many derivatives of chitin and the most important one is chitosan (Kumar, 2000) . Chitosan and chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) have important uses in the medical field, such as controlled drug release, artificial blood vessels, antidiabetic, antibacterial, antifungal and hemostatic effect (Baldrick, 2010; Xia et al., 2011; Muanprasat and Chatsudthipong, 2017) . In a study on the treatment of calves with diarrhea, oral chitosan oligosaccharide administration has been reported to be successful in treatment (Alam et al., 2012) . In studies conducted, chitosan has been reported to inhibit the in vitro development of C. parvum (Luzardo \u00c1lvarez et al., 2012; Adjou et al., 2014; Mammeri et al., 2018) . There is no study found in which the efficacy of chitosan oligosaccharide in the treatment of cryptosporidiosis in neonatal ruminants has been determined. According to this information, this study is the first to determine the efficacy of chitosan oligosaccharide in the treatment of cryptosporidiosis in lambs. Considering that chitosan inhibits the development of C. parvum in in vitro studies, we hypothesized that oral chitosan administration may be used in the treatment of lambs with experimentally cryptosporidiosis. The aim of this study was to determine the treatment efficacy of oral chitosan oligosaccharide in lambs with experimental cryptosporidiosis.",

            "text": "A major problem about cryptosporidiosis is the lack of an effective tool for the prevention and treatment of this disease. More than 200 substances have been tested to treat cryptosporidiosis (Dinler and Ulutas, 2017). Some have shown promising effects; however, none of them have been reported to control clinical findings consistently or eliminate the infection completely. On the other hand, the use of certain drugs may reduce the oocyst excretion and thus probably the environmental pathogen level, the subsequent exposure, and infection of susceptible hosts (Shahiduzzaman and Daugschies, 2012) . It has been reported that paromomycin, halofuginone lactate, lasalocid, and sulfaquinoxaline have partial or demonstrable effect against Cryptosporidium in infected neonatal ruminants (Wright and Coop, 2007; Aydogdu et al., 2018) . However, knowledge about the treatment of cryptosporidiosis in sheep is limited. Halofuginone exhibits 2-fold toxicity of the recommended doses of lactate, and its use is contraindicated in severely dehydrated or inappetent animals (Wright and Coop, 2007) . In addition, many drugs such as paromomycin, azithromycin, and sulfaquinoxaline that have been determined to reduce oocyst excretion in cryptosporidiosis have a risk to leave antibiotic residues. In recent years, serious concerns about antibiotic residues have emerged worldwide. In recent years, there have been studies carried out about the effects of chitosan and its derivatives on the underlying mechanism of antimicrobial activity of chitosan microparticles in the medical field and on the treatment of infectious diseases (Jeon et al., 2014) . Kim et al. (2001) reported that oral chitosan oligosaccharide applications at doses of 500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg/day did not cause any side effects Different letters in the same rows (A, B) and columns (a, b) are statistically significant (P < 0.05).

In a study conducted, protective activity of chitosan oligosaccharide has been determined in mice in which colitis was formed experimentally (Yousef et al., 2012) . Chung et al. (2012) , found that oral administering of chitosan oligosaccharide with a low molecular weight reduced the allergic inflammation in mice in which experimental asthma model was formed. Abdel-Latif et al. (2016) reported that it had \"anticoccidial\" effects on Eimeria papillata-infected mice. In the same study, it has been reported that both excreted oocysts and developmental stage parasites were reduced and chitosan had anti-inflammatory activity (Abdel-Latif et al., 2016) . In a study, oral chitosan oligosaccharide administering in the treatment of diarrheal calves has been reported to be very successful (Alam et al., 2012) . In addition, chitosan has been used to create excipients in a microparticle system and it has been reported that it might play a role as a physical barrier against Cryptosporidium parvum (Blanco-Garc\u00eda et al., 2016) . In the studies conducted, it has been reported to inhibit the in vitro development of C. parvum (Luzardo \u00c1lvarez et al., 2012; Adjou et al., 2014; Mammeri et al., 2018) . In addition, Mammeri et al. (2018) reported that chitosan NAG and chitosan mix demonstrated in vivo anticryptosporidial properties in CD-1 mice, a highly sensitive animal model against C. parvum infection. Therefore, it has been stated that both of these compounds have a promising potential in therapeutic and preventive applications against C. parvum infection. In this study, oocyst excretion decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in the 1st and 2nd groups by the 3rd day compared to pre-treatment and in the 3rd and 4th groups by the 5th day. As between groups, a significant decrease was observed in group 2 on the 3rd day and in group 3 on the 5th day compared to group 4 (p < 0.05). Although stool characteristics became normal on the 14th and 21 st days, it was observed that oocyst excretion still continued in the lambs. While all the lambs in the positive control group had oocyst excretion at the level of +1 on the 14th and 21st days, this level was found to be lower in treatment groups compared to the positive control group. However, there was no statistical difference found. These results showed that chitosan oligosaccharide significantly reduced oocyst excretion compared to the positive control group; however, it was not efficacious to eliminate cryptosporidiosis completely. According to the findings of this study, the use of chitosan oligosaccharide to be used in the treatment of experimental cryptosporidiosis at doses of 100 and/or 500 mg/kg was found to provide an earlier reduction in oocyst excretion compared to 1000 mg/kg dose. The use of higher doses had no negative effect; however, it increases the costs and does not show more positive affects compared to lower doses. Considering this, a dose of 100 mg/kg was thought to be the most appropriate dose. The results indicated that low dose of chitosan oligosaccharide was better to reduce oocyst excretion and improve clinical findings in lambs with cryptosporidiosis. Studies pH: concentration of hydrogen ions, pCO 2 : partial pressure of carbon dioxide, pO 2 : partial pressure of oxygen, HCO 3 \u2212 : bicarbonate, TCO 2 ; total amount of carbon dioxide, BE: base excess, O 2 sat: oxygen saturation. Different letters in the same rows (A, B) and columns (a, b) are statistically significant (P < 0.05). Group 1: 100 mg/kg COS, Group 2: 500 mg/kg COS, Group 3: 1000 mg/kg COS at intervals of 12 h, Group 4: No drug was given to the infected lambs. (Mammeri et al., 2018) on the exact mechanism of action of chitosan continue. It has been reported that it is possible for chitosan to cause effects on the production of trophozoites and oocysts via various mechanisms (direct effects on parasitic viability and/or infectivity and/or parasitic growth in intestines and/or oocyst formation) (Mammeri et al., 2018) . However, further studies are required to determine the exact mechanism of action. The limitations of this study are the absence of a negative control group without infection and treatment and the absence of groups treated with COS without cryptosporidiosis infection. Generally, if there is no mix infection, the clinical findings in cryptosporidiosis are not severe and are transient and mild levels. In mix infections, clinical findings are more severe and mortality rates are higher. Morbidity rates are high and mortality is low in cryptosporidiosis infections alone (Constable et al., 2017) . In this study, it was observed that the changes in the clinical findings were not severe in all groups; however, there were some individual differences. The characteristics of diarrhea improved day by day in the treatment groups and in the positive control group. In the treatment groups (G1-3), stools became normal or pasty in consistency on the 7th day, while there was still diarrhea in liquid level in 2 cases in the positive control group on the 7th day. These results showed that chitosan oligosaccharide provided faster recovery in clinical findings and stool characteristics in lambs with cryptosporidiosis compared to the positive control group.",

            "text": "The most important clinical finding in cryptosporidiosis is diarrhea in varying levels. Endogenous forms of Cryptosporidium lead to loss of mature enterocytes, shortening, and fusion of villus. They disrupt the microvilli boundary which causes the elongation of crypts caused by increased cell division and edema. This causes the loss of membranebound digestive enzymes, reduces intestinal absorption capacity and reduces intake of liquids, electrolytes, and nutrients from the intestinal lumen (Foster and Smith, 2009; Constable et al., 2017) . In this study, it was found that although some significant in-group and/or intragroup changes were observed in blood gases, hematological and biochemical parameters in both treatment groups and in the positive control group, these changes remained limited and progressed generally within the reference limits. Metabolic acidosis was observed in 3 cases in the group 1 on day 1 and 3; 1 case in the group 2 on day 0; 2 cases in the group 3 on day 0 and 1; 2 cases in the group 4 on day 5 and 7. However, it was determined that metabolic acidosis was at moderate and severe levels in only 1 st and 4th groups in 1 case in each. In other cases, the severity of metabolic acidosis remained mild. These results show that experimentally developed cryptosporidiosis alone in lambs leads to changes in blood gases and hematological and biochemical parameters; however, these changes were not at a level to disrupt the general condition.",

In this study, the appropriate chitosan oligosaccharide dose to treat cryptosporidiosis in lambs was observed to be 100-500 mg/kg, whereas new studies on this subject are required. We think that this study will provide a basic knowledge for further studies on the use of chitosan and its derivatives in the treatment of cryptosporidiosis in veterinary medicine.",
