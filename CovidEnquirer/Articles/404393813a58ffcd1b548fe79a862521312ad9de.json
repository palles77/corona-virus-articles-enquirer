Cordyceps is fascinating per se, especially because of the pathogenic lifestyle on Lepidopteron insects. The combination of the fungus and dead insect has been used as a TCM for centuries. However, the natural fungus has been harvested to the extent that it is an endangered species. The effectiveness has been attributed to the Chinese philosophical concept of Yin and Yang and can this be compatible with scientific philosophy? A vast literature exists, some of which is scientific, although others are popular myth, and even hype. Cordyceps sinensis is the most explored species followed by Cordyceps militaris. However, taxonomic concepts were confused until a recent revision, with undefined material being used that cannot be verified. Holomorphism is relevant and contamination might account for some of the activity. The role of the insect has been ignored. Some of the analytical methodologies are poor. Data on the ''old\" compound cordycepin are still being published: ergosterol and related compounds are reported despite being universal to fungi. There is too much work on crude extracts rather than pure compounds with water and methanol solvents being overrepresented in this respect (although methanol is an effective solvent). Excessive speculation exists as to the curative properties. However, there are some excellent pharmacological data and relating to apoptosis. For example, some preparations are active against cancers or diabetes which should be fully investigated. Polysaccharides and secondary metabolites are of particular interest. The use of genuine anamorphic forms in bioreactors is encouraged.",

In that case, the fungus was indeed a biofactory in the sense that numerous compounds have been reported from the fungus. What is the situation with another FTCM, Cordyceps? The immediate answer is that the state of the art is considerably less developed (see Table  2 for a list of secondary metabolites). There is a general impression that this fungus is being used in a modern context, before the benefits, and even what is being used, have been determined scientifically. Cordyceps is one of a growing number of FTCM being considered as cures for mod- Table 1 Medically related purported effects of various Cordyceps taxa (or preparations) as described by various authors ern human diseases.

The genus contains over 400 species and the anamorphs of most are unknown. Paecilomyces is considered traditionally to host the anamorphs but this has been disputed. Sung et al. (2007) should be consulted for an up-to-date revision (and see later). Cordyceps are parasites of insects or fungi, often exhibiting a high degree of host specificity (Fig. 1) . However, the Cordyceps species associated with Lepidopteran hosts do not represent a monophyletic group. There is even a high degree of genetic variation within Cordyceps sinensis which creates difficulties in verifying samples. A taxonomic review of the fungus is now available (see later section) a similar review is required for Ganoderma (e.g. see Paterson, 2006 . Larval infection via meiotic and/or mitotic spores/conidia and multiplication within the insect is from yeast-like budding. However, the fungus grows through the insect by hyphae. The accumulation of the biomass eventually kills the host (and/or a toxin(s) may be involved). It would be interesting to determine the biochemical parameters that cause these changes but this is not reported in the literature. The fungus ruptures the host body following over wintering and forms the sexual perithecial stroma that are connected to the dead larva below ground which grow upward to emerge above the soil surface (Fig. 1) . The complete insect/fungus combination is used traditionally, but not exclusively, for medicinal purposes. The present reviewer has seen no reports of the insect per se being given as a treatment.",

The believe is that C. sinensis (CS) has various beneficial effects on humans, including those of a psychological nature. The FTCM, is also called Dong Chong Xia Cao in Chinese (=winter worm summer grass) (Li et al., 2006a) . Primarily it is prescribed as a tonic for body strengthening after serious disease. More recently other treatments have been claimed such as for (a) respiratory, renal, liver, nervous system and cardiovascular diseases, and (b) tumours, aging, hyposexuality and hyperlipidemia (Kuo et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2006; Wang and Shiao, 2000) . It has been officially classified as a drug in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia since 1964. Furthermore, the outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China in 2003 has increased use considerably. This would have been an excellent opportunity to have determined how effective it was. However, this does not appear to have been undertaken. The market demand for CS is growing sharply in many countries (Dong and Yao, 2007) . They would surely be hailed as medical breakthroughs if the efficacy of any of these treatments were confirmed. Nevertheless, the identities of active components have not been determined (in all cases) (Li et al., 2006b) . Research has shown that at least some of the traditional uses ''may\" relate to pharmacological activities (Zhu et al., 1998a,b) (if not pharmacological activities then what?). Herbs have been used throughout history to enhance physical performance, but scientific scrutiny with controlled clinical trials has only recently been used to study such effects (Bucci, 2000) .

Consequently, living strains have been isolated from natural CS and cultivated in large quantity by bioreactor technology which is a promising method to meet the needs of human consumption and to reduce the pressure on natural resources of the species (Dong and Yao, 2007) .",

Thus, a growing number of socalled Cordyceps products that derive from mycelial cultures of the asexual forms of these fungi have become commercially available (Hamburger, 2007) . Mycelia cultivation has resulted in establishing a number of cultures derived from the holomorphic CS. These are referred to by the anamorphic names Paecilomyces hepiali and Cephalosporium sinensis, although the anamorph of CS appears to be Hirsutella sinensis (and see later). However, the situation is confused with some taxonomist using outdated names. To paraphrase Buenz et al. (2004 Buenz et al.

It is clearly important to confirm the presence of the compound in CS in terms of determining the active components of the fungus and ultimately for chemotaxonomic purposes. Cho et al. (2007) state that cordycepin is isolated from C. militaris and is (claimed to be) an ingredient in TCM which is prescribed for various diseases, such as cancer and chronic inflammation (again note how vague this verbatim statement is). In this study, the novel effect of cordycepin inhibiting collagen-induced platelet aggregation was reported. The data suggests that the inhibitory effect of cordycepin might be associated with the down-regulation of [Ca 2+ ]i and the elevation of cAMP/cGMP production. This result has obvious significance for prevention of thrombus formation. Finally, cordycepin inhibited the growth of B16 melanoma cells inoculated subcutaneously into right murine footpads (Yoshikawa et al., 2004) .",

The suppressive activity was found to be equal to, or higher than cyclosporin A which is used clinically. The activities of the 10 derivatives were also examined, indicating the following relationships between structure and activity -the: (a) lactone formation between the carboxy group at C-1 and the hydroxy group at C-4, and the reduction of the carbonyl group at C-14 to the hydroxy group do not affect the suppressive activity; (b) hydrogenation of the double bond at C-6 resulted in activity; and (c) acetylation of the amino group and the thioketalization on the carbonyl group at C-14 ''drastically\" reduced the suppressive activity. Also, the compound suppressed the production of anti-bodies to sheep red blood cells and induction of cytotoxic lymphocyte T cells more strongly than cyclosporin A. Obviously, this is an important lead compound and hence one of the more satisfactory papers. Chen et al. (1999) isolated a pure compound (H1-A) from CS and investigated whether autoimmune disease progression in mice was affected by administration of the metabolite. The authors are vague as to what the compound is and state that, ''it is a kind of ergosterol and looks like testosterone\". The authors also provide a chemical structure which confirms that it is a common sterol and a systematic name could have been provided. Their results demonstrated that mice treated daily exhibited a progressive reduction in anti-ds-DNA production. In clinical presentation, the treated group had a reduction in lymphadenopathy, a delayed progression of proteinuria, and an improvement in kidney function. Histological analysis of kidney tissue indicated that H1-A inhibited mesangial proliferation that was evident in lupus nephritis. However, there was no change in immune complex deposition. H1-A ''may be\" useful for treating systemic lupus erythematosus in human patients. However, more work is required. H1-A was claimed to be effective in the treatment of autoimmune disorders (Yang et al., 2003) . Results demonstrated inhibition of cell proliferation and promotion of apoptosis of activated human mesangial cells in vitro: the activities were not a result of cytotoxicity. In addition, H1-A inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of human mesangial proteins. These findings suggest that H1-A modulated some (unspecific) subcellular signal-transduction pathways and changed the balance between proliferation and apop-tosis of mesangial cells in vitro and in vivo. The conclusions were that H1-A may be effective in the management of autoimmune disorders, and the modulation of the signal-transduction proteins may represent a target for future pharmacologic interventions. More correctly, they probably do represent a target, and such vague statements should be avoided. In an older report, HI-A alleviated immunoglobulin A nephropathy (Berger's disease) with histological and clinical improvement . HI-A inhibited the proliferation of human mesangial cells and promoted apoptosis by suppressing tyrosine phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (Yang et al., 2003) and reduced antids-DNA production and lymphadenopathy, delayed progression of proteinuria, improved kidney function and inhibited mesangial proliferation .",

CMESS showed a potent inhibitory activity of 34.7% in starchloaded mice: CMESS reduced blood glucose level by 35.5%. However, CCCA, and cordycepin showed no difference. After 7 days administrations of these drugs, CMESS, and cordycepin dramatically reduced blood glucose level. CCCA with a high concentration of cordycepin did not reduce blood glucose level. Proliferation of T-lymphocyte was significantly decreased; while NO production was increased more than two-fold in the cordycepin-administered group. The proliferation of macrophages and NO production were significantly decreased in the CMESS administered group. CMESS and cordycepin may be (a) useful tools in the control of blood glucose level in diabetes and (b) promising new drugs as an anti-hyperglycemic agent without the defects of lowered immune responses and other side effects, the authors suggest.",

It proceeds to state that P. japonica is a new type of Cordyceps species, which is incomprehensible. It also mentions that P. japonica is (or produces) mushrooms. Paecilomyces is considered to be an anamorph of Cordyceps and so this appears to be incorrect and, what appear to be mushrooms, may be synnemata (compacted conidiophores). However, it is unwise to speculate what the material actually is as descriptions are vague. A protein-bound polysaccharide that inhibited lipid peroxidation and increased the activity of anti-oxidant was described from the fungus. Finally, phaeochromocytoma cells were protected against H 2 O 2 -induced injury by a 210-kDa polysaccharide from CS mycelium . Yamada et al. (1984) reported that a water-insoluble extracellular glucan isolated from the culture filtrate of C. ophioglossoides suppressed potently the growth of sarcoma 180 solid-type tumours. Remarkably, a protein-bound polysaccharide fraction from C. ophioglossoides extended the life of mice bearing Ehrlich carcinoma or a syngeneic tumour . Also, Ohmori et al. (1989a,b) isolated a galactosaminoglycan that inhibited the proliferation of sarcoma 180 cells and the growth of a syngeneic solid tumour in vivo: it exhibited cytotoxicity against cancer cells in vitro. Chen et al. (1997) observed that medium from blood mononuclear cells stimulated with the polysaccharide fraction from CS inhibited the proliferation of human leukaemic cells, and induced approximately 50% to differentiate into mature monocytes/macrophages expressing non-specific esterase activity and certain surface antigens. The anti-proliferation and differentiating effects were demonstrated to be caused by an elevated production of cytokines, i.e. a tumour necrosis factor and an interferon. The exopolysaccharide fraction of CS inhibited metastasis of melanoma cells and down-regulated concomitantly the levels of Bcl-2 protein into the lungs and the liver .",

(2004a,b) isolated four polysaccharides from C. militaris, CPS-1 was shown to possess a significant anti-inflammatory activity and suppressed the humoral immunity in mice but had no significant effects on cellular immunity and non-specific immunity. In a previous study using anti-oxidant activity-guided fractionation CSP-1 from cultured Cordyceps, mycelium was isolated. The hypoglycemic effect of CSP-1 on mice and rats was demonstrated. CSP-1 increased circulating insulin level in diabetic animals, which suggests that the compound(s) may stimulate pancreatic release of insulin and/ or reduce insulin metabolism. Chen et al. (2006) undertook further work on the biological activity of the isolate: the polysaccharide from fungus and its anti-oxidant activity on H22-tumour bearing mice was investigated. The H22 tumour growth was inhibited and SOD activity of liver, brain and serum and GSH-Px activity of liver and brain in tumour-bearing mice were enhanced. In general, beneficial effects were observed in the liver and brain of tumourbearing mice.",

However, this study provoked a strong response from Hamburger (2007) which was subsequently rebutted by one of the original authors (Duh, 2007) . This is something of an unexpected bonus to a reviewer of the literature such as myself as another opinion is obtained. The questions are, what biological material is being worked with, and can other scientists obtain it to repeat the experiment? The current author has encountered this before (Paterson, 2005) where commercial interests are involved. The Hamburger response can be applied in a general sense to some of the other work cited in the present review. CME and CSE showed weakly inhibitory effect on liposome oxidation. The inhibitory effect of CME on protein oxidation was inferior to that of CSE. CME and CSE showed inhibition of LDL oxidation. The contents of the bioactive ingredients cordycepin and adenosine in CME were higher than those of CSE; however, cordycepin and adenosine showed no significant anti-oxidant activity. In addition, a polysaccharide present in CME and CSE displayed anti-oxidant activity. The authors concluded that the protective effects of CME and CSE against oxidative damage of biomolecules are a result of their free radical scavenging abilities. However, the experimental data and some of the conclusions need a critical comment (Hamburger, 2007) . The author criticised the report on the bases of poor taxonomy, biochemistry and extrapolation of data to imply possible cures of diseases. In particular, the authors' claims of a potential treatment for human disease on the basis of in vitro data are called into question. The rebuttal by Duh simply confirms that appropriate information about the strains was not provided; the comments on the inadequate analytical procedures are largely accepted. And there is no doubt that the conclusions could have been rewritten to indicate that the results were preliminary. Hamburger (personal communication, 2007) stated that the rebuttal was evasive, an assessment with which I agree. Kuo et al. (2005) describe the effects of CS against Group A streptococcus infection in mice. The preparation protected by decreasing bacterial growth ''and dissemination\", thereby increasing mouse survival rate. IL-12 and IFN-gamma expression and macrophage phagocytic activity also increased. Kuo et al. (2007) claim to demonstrate that CS increased phagocytosis in human monocytic cells and abrogated inhibition of phagocytosis by causing cytokine production. These two reports are sound and in good journals. However, the fungus used was from a company called Simpson Biotech and very few or no details are supplied about how the material was collected, identified, maintained, and grown. Of course, this is unsatisfactory. Shahed et al. (2001) refer somewhat unusually to CS as a ''black blade\" fungus. Their results showed that CS improved renal function and reduced the expression of inflammatory and apoptotic genes in rats. The authors make the very conditional statement that, CS extract may play a potential therapeutic role in renal transplantation\"; on the other hand it may not play an actual role. After all, precision in what is written in such important areas of medicinal research is crucial. The authenticity of the fungal material can be questioned: it was obtained from a company from the United States of America and there is little indication about the standards of collecting, purity, identities and maintenance of the materials. Basically, what level of accreditation applies to such organizations?",

            "text": "The influence of CS on the immunoactivity of macrophages was determined to probe the mechanism of its alleged tonic effect. The phagocytosis of macrophages were enhanced significantly (Jia and Lau, 1997) and ''maybe\" the tonic effect of CS is accomplished by an enhancing effect on the immune system. Some chemical fractions had insulin like and insulin release promoting activity and ''could be developed\" as an anti-diabetic agent (Young et al., 2001) . Cordyceps possessed a strong anti-oxidation activity in all assays tested by Li et al. (2001a) . The cultured Cordyceps mycelia had equally strong anti-oxidation activity compared to in vivo Cordyceps. Further, the anti-oxidation activities were increased \u00c210-30 in the partially purified polysaccharide fractions. In an intriguing report, Liu et al. (2006) mentions that identification of an effective non-toxic biological radioactivity protector is a ''matter of some urgency\". Orally administered CS protected mice from bone marrow and intestinal injuries after total-body irradiation. The levels of free radical species within cells are suggested to be a likely mechanism for the purported effects. The biochemical mechanisms of anti-proliferative effects of C. militaris in human leukemia cells were investigated in a convincing study involving cancer treatment . It was found that they inhibited cell growth in a dose-dependent manner, which was associated with morphological change and apoptotic cell death such as formation of apoptotic bodies and DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, the treatment caused a dose-dependent inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (see Paterson, 2008) and prostaglandin E2 accumulation. Taken together, these results indicated that the anti-proliferative effects were associated with the induction of apoptotic cell death through regulation of several major growth regulatory gene products. The extracts ''may have therapeutic potential\" in human leukemia treatment. In addition, corticosterone output by cultured rat adrenocortical cells was increased without increasing the intracellular cAMP level. The steroidogenic effect was abolished by the protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C, indicating that its action may involve stimulation of protein kinase C (Wang et al., 1998) . C. militaris reduced the fasting serum glucose level and enhances glucose utilisation in skeletal muscles in rats . The fungus demonstrated cytotoxic activities on the three kinds of human cancer cell lines, stomachic adenocarcinoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma (Lim et al., 2004) . Cytotoxic activity-guided isolation and identification of active fractions afforded the well-known, cordycepin as an active component (see above). Koh et al. (2003b) reported that CS mycelia prolonged swimming endurance capacity and produced an anti-fatigue action in mice. CS reduced the hepatic content of malondialdehyde and the serum concentrations of transaminases and alkaline phosphatase in rats with hepatic fibrosis. Treatment with the extracellular biopolymers resulted in a reduction in hepatic hydroxyproline content and normalization of morphological characteristics of the liver, indicating an anti-fibrotic action (Nan et al., 2001) . Finally, crystals of the fungus stimulated proliferation of erythroid progenitor cells in mouse bone marrow .",

            "text": "In a surprising paper, the following may be an example of the mystical nature of some of the reports (see Paterson, 2006) . It represents a bizarre rational for undertaking the work and it is surprising that it was published from a scientific perspective. The rational for the work is that CS is a popular Chinese tonifying herb, and was/is revered for being, what is referred to as, 'Yin-nourishing' and 'Yanginvigorating' in Chinese medicine (Siu et al., 2004) . In order to establish the pharmacological basis for the 'Yinnourishing' and 'Yang-invigorating' action of Cordyceps, the effects of wild and cultured Cordyceps on concanavalin A stimulated splenocytes, an in vitro bioassay for 'Yinnourishment', and myocardial ATP generation capacity, an ex vivo bioassay for 'Yang-invigoration', were investigated in mice. The results indicated that wild and cultured Cordyceps enhanced the Con A-stimulated splenocyte proliferation in vitro and myocardial mitochondrial ATP generation ex vivo in mice, with no significant difference in potency of action between the two types of Cordyceps. While the immunopotentiating effect was associated with the increase in interleukin-2 production, the stimulation of myocardial ATP generation was paralleled by an enhancement in mitochondrial electron transport. When compared with typical 'Yin' and 'Yang' tonifying Chinese herbs, Cordyceps was found to possess both 'Yin-nourishing' and 'Yang-invigorating' activities, with a lower potency in both modes of action. It is impossible to take reports such as these seriously from a scientific standpoint and is given considerable space here to indicate a general problem which may have motivated some of the published reports reviewed herein. This is without attempting to detract from the philosophical aspects of the concepts of Yin and Yang in terms of two mutually correlated opposites in a general sense. A comprehensive definition of the corresponding philosophy of science is inappropriate: It is enough to state that it is vitally important for science that the information about the surrounding world and the objects of study be as accurate and as reliable as possible.",

Growth inhibitors other than cordycepin and polysaccharides may have been involved; two fractions significantly inhibited (a) the blastogenesis response, (b) NK cell activity and (c) IL-2 production (Kuo et al., 1996) . Neither fraction was cytotoxic, and immunosuppressive ingredients were found to be intracellular. Fruiting bodies inhibited human mesangial cells (HMC) activation by IL-1 plus IL-6 and liver toxicity or mutagenicity were not observed. The fraction was purified to obtain purified compound H1-A (see above). The authors claim a novel treatment for human Berger's disease ''in the future\". A fraction (a) dose dependently suppressed bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) cells proliferation, (b) reduced interleukin production in LPS activated BALF cell cultures and (c) affected interleukin mRNAs in various significant manners (Kuo et al., 2001) . The purported therapeutic activity may be related to modulation of cells functions in bronchial airways. Furthermore, the molecular mechanism of Cordyceps pruinosa pharmacological and biochemical actions of macrophages in inflammation has not been clearly elucidated . The authors suggest that an extract suppresses inflammation through suppression of NF-jB-dependent inflammatory gene expression, and hence may be beneficial for treatment of endotoxin shock or sepsis. Shim et al. (2000) wrote that they attempted to develop ''a new type Cordyceps\". To obtain this, they investigated the effects of the fruiting bodies of the cultivated fungus of P. japonica grown on silkworm larvae on hyperglycemia in rats and mice and on immunological functions in mice. As mentioned previously, it is not at all clear whether Paecilomyces (even) contains anamorphs of Cordyceps. Therefore, this report is a cause of some concern. Immunostimulating activity and a significant anti-fatigue effect in mice were observed. Kuo et al. (1994) reported unidentified substances which inhibited tumour cells, but which were not cordycepin or polysaccharides, in the methanolic extract of CS -this report requires further investigation.",

However, it is disappointing that details of the cultivation of the fruiting bodies are not provided as this is required. Nitric oxide production and iNOS gene expression in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells are suppressed by ethanolic preparations (Won and Park, 2005) . A unique insight into how the cultured fruiting bodies were produced in this report and should be referred to: this detail is required in future reports. CS (as supplied by the ''Xinhui Xinhan Artificial Cordyceps Factory\" (sic)) inhibited MDA generation via hydroxyl radicals induced by the peroxynitrite generator SIN-1 and macrophage accumulation of esterified cholesterol (Yamaguchi et al., 2000a,b) . The authors concluded that the cultured CS has anti-oxidant and anti-lipid peroxidation properties and inhibits accumulation of cholesteryl ester in macrophages via suppression of LDL oxidation. The authors conclude correctly that this cultured Chinese medicine appears to merit further investigation as an anti-atherosclerotic.",

CS was extracted in PBS and dialyzed (Chiou et al., 2000) the resulting macromolecule fraction was assayed in anesthetized rats for hypotensive effects and in isolated aorta for vasorelaxant effects. A constituent(s) in CS relaxed vascular beds directly. The in vivo and in vitro effects and its extracted fractions on the secretion of testosterone in mice were studied (Hsu et al., 2003a) . CS, watersoluble protein, and poorly water-soluble polysaccharide and protein significantly stimulated in vitro testosterone production in purified mouse Leydig cells. The authors concluded that it is ''possible\" that CS ''might\" contribute to an alternative medicine for the treatment of some reproductive problems caused by insufficient testosterone levels in human males, which is a large leap in conclusions. Increase antigen expression was found in hepatoma cells and ''will\" provide more effective host immune surveillance against tumour cells (Chiu, 1998 ) from a Cordyceps extract. In an interesting study, the beneficial effects of the ''traditional Chinese medicine CS\", on mice with hypoferric anaemia were evaluated by NMR spectroscopy (Manabe et al., 2000) . The extract increased hepatic energy metabolism in anaemic mice and was concluded to be due to increased hepatic blood flow. Zhang et al. (2006) concluded that ''their\" extract ''is\" effective in resisting the oxidative damage on liver mitochondria of diabetic mice. Qiao and Jian (2007) attempted to identify the signaling pathways for the induction of HL-60 cell apoptosis by CS mycelium extract (CSME). CSME induced nuclear fragmentation and DNA degradation, two hallmark events of apoptosis, in the HL-60 cells within 12-24 h of treatment. Concomitantly, several major events in the mitochondrial signal pathway occurred, including (a) the loss of MTP, (b) cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm, (c) the decrease in Bcl-2 protein level, (d) the translocation of Bax protein from cytoplasm into mitochondria, and (e) the activation of caspase-2, -3, and -9. However, caspase-8, the initiator caspase in the death receptor pathway, was not activated. These results suggest that CSME induces apoptosis in HL-60 cell through the mitochondrial pathway rather than the death receptor pathway.",

The number of T helper cells was increased, as were Lyt-1/Lyt-2 (T helper cells to T suppressor cells) in peripheral blood and spleen . A mitogenic action was demonstrated on splenic lymphocytes and interleukin-2 from spleen cells of rats with chronic renal failure was augmented (Cheng, 1992) . In addition, natural killer cell activity was enhanced (Xu et al., 1992) . Treatment of patients with post-hepatic cirrhosis resulted in (a) enhancement of natural killer cell function, (b) increased number and improved ratio of CD4\u00fe and CD8\u00fe cells, and (c) reduction in IgA and IgG levels (Zhu and Liu, 1992) . Treatment of chronic hepatitis B resulted in increased CD4/CD8 ratios, and reductions in hyaluronic acid and procollagen type III. The data indicate the usefulness of the fungus in adjusting the level of T lymphocyte subsets and treating hepatic fibrosis (Gong et al., 2000) . Liu et al.

Improved renal function and augmented cellular immune function in chronic renal failure has also been observed (Guan et al., 1992) .

CS mycelium is ''believed\" to enhance libido and fertility in both sexes. However, the mechanism of its effect in women has not been determined. This is surely a rather thin basis on which to undertake research. Huang et al. (2004a) concluded that treatment of granulosa-lutein cells with CS results in increased 17b-estradiol production due, in part, to increased StAR and aromatase expression. If these data are confirmed, CS may help in the development of treatment regimens to improve the success rate of in vitro fertilization, they state. Zhu and Liu (1992) found that cultivated Cordyceps mycelia inhibited humoral immune hyperfunction and increase the serum complement level in patients with post-hepatic cirrhosis, and improved liver function. Whole body insulin sensitivity in rats was increased (Balon et al., 2002) . The fungus increased the basal plasma insulin level (Zhang et al., 2003) and inhibited hepatic fibrogenesis in rats with CCl 4 -induced liver fibrosis. Previous studies by Lo et al. (2006) demonstrated that the fruiting bodies of CS attenuated diabetes-induced weight loss, polydipsia, and hyperglycemia in rats. Rats were orally administered, fruiting bodies, fermented mycelia, spent broth, or mycelia plus spent broth of the fungus. The results revealed that the mycelia and spent broth had anti-hyperglycemic activities similar to those of the fruiting bodies. The authors , bold claim that the fermented products could be developed as potential anti-diabetic agents or functional foods for persons with a high risk of diabetes mellitus needs further confirmation. Yang et al. (2006) mention that mycelium can inhibit tumour growth and induce tumour cell apoptosis. However, the antitumour mechanisms are not fully understood. So, the molecular mechanism was determined. The authors conclude that cell apoptosis is induced by activating caspase-8-dependent and caspase-9-independent pathways and downregulating NF-jB protein expression.",

The authors state that, ''Our results possibly provide the biochemical basis for future clinical trials\". The current author emphasises that such over extrapolation of data needs to be discouraged. Dai et al. (2001) found that CordyMax Cs-4 (a mycelial fermentation product of CS) ''improved the bioenergy status\" in the mouse liver. These findings may explain why CordyMax Cs-4 is claimed to alleviate fatigue and improve physical endurance especially in aged subjects. Reports of athletes' performance being improved may also be supported from these types of reports. CordyMax Cs-4 lowered fasting plasma levels of glucose and insulin, improved oral glucose tolerance and increased the glucose-insulin index, which measures insulin sensitivity, in rats (Zhao et al., 2002) .",

Cells pre-incubated with CS extracts were equally sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and Fas-mediated apoptosis. Thus, the putative antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties of CS were insufficient to rescue cells from apoptosis in vitro (Buenz et al., 2004) . Furthermore, cancer chemotherapeutics have involved the ability to induce apoptosis. Hence the polysaccharide fraction (H1-A) induced apoptosis by inhibiting (a) phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and (b) apoptosis induced by dimethyl sulfoxide (Yang et al., 2003) . These data require to be confirmed by further work (Buenz et al., 2005) .",

Gliocladinins A and B are of an isolate of Gliocladium sp. that colonized CS (Guo et al., 2007) . It is essential that such activity is differentiated from that obtained from the traditional medicine or Cordyceps per se. In a series of papers, (a) Paecilomyces militaris is shown to possess militarinones A, B, C, D and (b) farinosomes and a deoxymilitarinone substance were detected from Paecilomyces farinosus (Schmidt et al., 2002 (Schmidt et al., , 2003 Cheng et al., 2004 Cheng et al., , 2006 . The authors do not make statements as to the holomophic connections to Cordyceps. Hamburger (2007) does make this link to C. militaris (teleomorph) from P. militaris (anamorph) apparently on the basis of the same pigment production. However, it is has been suggested that Paecilomyces does not contain anamophic species of Cordyceps . Hence, comment on these reports is avoided by the current author because the relationships between Paecilomyces and Cordyceps remain ill-defined.",

Could the activity be greater at these stages? The accumulation of bioactive plant metabolites by insects is well documented (Brown and Trigo, 1994) and insects are used as medicines . These aspects are almost totally ignored in the case of the medicinal Cordyceps. It appears as if entomologists have simply not been involved in the field.

Diabetic rats had significantly lower weight gain and higher blood glucose response in oral glucose tolerance test than the control rats; and these changes were significantly reduced by administrating the fruiting body of Cordyceps.

However, Kim and Yun (2005) investigated the optimal culture conditions for the production of exopolysaccharides (EPS) and cordycepin during submerged mycelial culture of C. militaris and CS. This was not done in the paper Hamburger (2007) comments upon. Fermentations were performed in flasks and in 5-L stirredtank bioreactors. The concentrations of mycelial biomass, EPS and cordycepin achieved in submerged culture of C. militaris were higher than those of CS. As the authors claim, comparative studies between the two fungi are not available and the paper was the first report on the optimum medium composition for submerged culture of CS. Cordyceps nutans Pat. is another entomopathogenitic Ascomycete belonging to the family Clavicipitaceae which is parasitic on hemipteran insects (Sasaki et al., 2005) . Very few investigations have been made with this fungus. In this research, optimum temperature and pH for mycelial growth was determined. However, it appeared that growth remained low and commercial exploitation perhaps limited. However, it would be interesting to include this species in any future taxonomic treatments of the genus. Optimisation of culture conditions for mycelial growth and production of polysaccharides and cordycepin were described by Park et al. (2001b Park et al. ( , 2002 , Xu et al. (2002) , Kim et al.

However, in a most impressive paper, Sung et al. (2007) state that Cordyceps comprise over 400 species in their modern phylogenetic classification of Cordyceps and the clavicipitaceous fungi. Cordyceps Fr. host range is broad, ranging from 10 orders of arthropods to the truffle-like genus Elaphomyces, although most species are restricted to a single host species or closely related host species. The main objectives of the study was to reassess the (a) morphological traits used currently, (b) taxonomic utility of the anamorphic forms and (3) classification in relation to phylogenetic relationships. It may be worth mentioning that PCRs may be subjected to inhibition, and nucleic acids may be affected by the medium in which the fungus was grown (see Paterson, , 2008 . Unfortunately, Sung et al. (2007) do not provide details of how the fungi were grown for analysis and so it is difficult to conjecture. Obviously, as discussed in this review, the fungus produces numerous bioactive compounds which may be inhibitors or mutagens and the effect of metabolite production on the DNA preparations need to be determined or misleading results may be obtained.",

            "text": "However, to continue, it is worth mentioning that C. militaris maintains its name in the study while C. sinensis is now classified as Ophiocordyceps sinensis. The taxon was historically classified in the Clavicipitaceae, based on cylindrical asci, thickened ascus apices and filiform ascospores, which often disarticulate into part-spores. The fungus was characterized by having a pathological ecology on Elaphomyces and arthropods, with infrageneric classifications emphasizing ascospore morphology, host affiliation and arrangement of perithecia. The production of welldeveloped often stipitate stromata was typical. Sung et al. re-classified on the basis of phylogenetic relationships between 162 taxa by employing five to seven genetic loci. Three clavicipitaceous clades were determined which rejected the monophyly of Cordyceps and Clavicipitaceae and most diagnostic characters used in Cordyceps were not supported as being phylogenetically informative. However, the most consistent characters with the phylogeny were pigmentation, morphology and morphology of stromata. Cordycipitaceae was validated based on C. militaris, the type of Cordyceps, which included most Cordyceps species that possess bright, fleshy stromata. The new family Ophiocordycipitaceae was proposed. The majority of species here produce stromata that often possess aperithecial apices and are darkly pigmented, tough to pliant. Elaphocordyceps was proposed for a subclade of the Ophiocordycipitaceae, which includes species of Cordyceps that parasitize (a) the fungal genus Elaphomyces and (b) arthropods. The family Clavicipitaceae included the core clade of grass symbionts, and the entomopathogenic genus Hypoc-rella and relatives. The new genus Metacordyceps is proposed for Cordyceps species that are closely related to the grass symbionts in the Clavicipitaceae s. s. Metacordyceps includes teleomorphs linked to Metarhizium and other closely related anamorphs. Lists of accepted names for species in Cordyceps, Elaphocordyceps, Metacordyceps and Ophiocordyceps are provided. Obviously, this work needs to be consulted in future work on the fungus for medicinal properties as does Stadler et al. (2003) .",

Furthermore, there are no biochemical data on how the insect are converted into fungal components, or if the insect host per se has pharmacological properties. Poor (i.e. inadequate or obsolete) biochemical procedures and assays can also because problems (see Hamburger, 2007) . The biological material being used often is not well characterised and there are few indications of specimens being available for other workers to repeat the described work for example (i.e. no voucher specimens are available), with some notable exceptions. A rather limited range of solvents have been employed to extract the components and, for example, chloroform/methanol is particularly efficacious for fungal compounds (e.g. Paterson and Bridge, 1994) . There is very little on the use of non-polar solvents. Paterson et al. (2004) , Paterson (2006) and Paterson (2008) have advocated a method which may have utility in standardising bioactive fungi.
