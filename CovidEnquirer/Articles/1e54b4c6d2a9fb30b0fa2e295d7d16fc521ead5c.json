Through yielding powerful insights into the past, the Tree of Life provides a means to interpret the patterns and processes of evolution, as well as the ability to predict the responses of life in the face of rapid environmental change. Broad knowledge of species relationships is fundamental, providing crucial new information regarding the discovery of medicines, combatting diseases, and crop improvement. This information has also had major impacts in the diverse fields of genomics, evolution, and development, while providing insights into the study of adaptation, speciation, community assembly, and ecosystem functioning. Given the many benefits, it is therefore hard to summarize, in a few words, the immense implications and applications of the Tree of Life to biology and human well-being.",

In fact, most of our medicines trace originally to chemical compounds from plants-humans did not invent these compounds, nature did. Species in nature have evolved numerous chemicals with diverse purposes and roles-the benefits range from defense to capturing prey. Those same chemicals may also be of value to our own species. Many of these useful compounds are discovered by chance through the basic research of an observant/inquisitive biologist, or traced to a long history of use in traditional medicines. On the one hand, it is therefore important to preserve the Tree of Life simply because there is so much hidden, as-of-yet untapped medical value in the species that compose the Tree of Life.

However, as species are lost to extinction, that potential utility is also lost forever-hence, the importance of protecting the species that constitute the Tree of Life, simply for utilitarian reasons. Imagine the loss of a species that held the cure to a disease that might have saved your life, or the lives of your friends, relatives, or children. But imagine that this same species was driven to extinction before that knowledge was realized. How many potential medicines have already been lost due to species loss in the Anthropocene, and how many more will soon follow? If half of all plants (the major source of medicines) go extinct by the end of the century as predicted (see Chapter 6), imagine the human impact on medical loss alone! As noted, new medicines often come from unexpected sources, and these make interesting stories in natural history and for the importance of protecting biodiversity.

Pitcher plants are carnivorous, widely known for trapping insects and other prey items and digesting them as a source of nitrogen. Prey items fall into a pool of fluid located inside the modified leaf (pitcher) (Fig. 5 .2B) that contains digestive enzymes. Basic research has revealed that the pitchers of these plants have also evolved compounds that are antifungal-special enzymes that dissolve the cell walls of fungi. By producing these enzymes, the plants are able to inhibit fungal growth and by so doing the plants do not lose the resources in the prey trapped in the pitcher to fungi (Eilenberg et al., 2006) . Significantly, these enzymes have shown great promise as new antifungal drugs in treating infections in our own species. Drugs derived from pitcher plants have been used to treat sciatic pain, symptoms of the herpes simplex virus (Mishra et al., 2013) , diabetes (Muhammad et al., 2012) , and tumors.",

There are many such examples, but a classic case involves the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia; Fig. 5 .3A) from western North America. This relative of pine trees is the original source of the drug paclitaxel (PTX0, sold using the brand name Taxol), a medicine that has been used to treat several types of cancer (Jordan and Wilson, 2004) . From 1967 to 1993, nearly all paclitaxel was derived from bark obtained from the Pacific yew. But because the Pacific yew is uncommon and the process of obtaining the bark for medicine is a destructive process that kills the tree, the species is a problematic long-term source of the drug. Consequently, another source of the drug was needed. To find chemicals similar to what the Pacific yew produces, where do we look? Rather than randomly examining all 350,000 species of seed plants, the best approach is to use the Tree of Life to focus on the closest relatives of this species-and that is what was done. A commonly grown related species, the European yew, Taxus baccata, was then instead widely used in medicine until Taxol ultimately was made synthetically.",

This is an example of the use of trees of relationship in detective work-to assess whether the dentist transmitted HIV to his patients. The tree indicates that he did. The white-winged warbler was long considered just one of many species of warbler . . . however, use of DNA data and the Tree of Life showed it was not a true warbler (Fig. 5 .7) (Klein et al., 2004) . In a phylogeny of birds, the white-winged warbler occurred on its own branch, outside of the group or clade of true warblers. Based on these data, the bird was placed in its very own family. And because it only occurs on Hispaniola, Figure 5 .6 Predicting the evolution of human flu (influenza). Bush et al. (1999) examined the evolution of one domain of the human influenza or flu virus (domain HA1 of the H3 hemagglutinin gene). By building a phylogenetic tree, they found that a single dominant lineage persisted through time. Red symbols indicate several important recent strains. The tree in (A) shows the evolution of the HA1 domain from 1983 through 1994. Part (B) contains isolates from 1983 through 1997. In (B), the authors collapsed many branches of the tree for which they lacked strong support. Note that strain A/Shangdong/5/94 (indicated by a red square) descends from the node indicated by an arrow in tree B-this represents an uppermost node on (A) (A/ Shangdong/5/94 is shown on both trees). This strain is further up the trunk of the tree in (B) than any of the other isolates from 1A-and it is also the isolate most closely related to future lineages (indicated by a vertical line). Thus, a tree can be used to predict future evolution of the virus. The authors also found evidence that 18 codons had been under selection in the past to change the amino acid they encoded. Redrawn and modified from Bush, R.M., Bender, C.A., Subbarao, K., Cox, N.J., this distinct line of birds now merits extra conservation concern (Fig. 5.7).",

But when DNA studies in the 1990s finally showed the placement of Amborella in the plant Tree of Life, that all changed. Amborella has the distinctive position as sister to all other living flowering plants ( Fig. 5.8 ). That is, Amborella is to flowering plants what the duckbilled platypus is to mammals (Warren et al., 2008) . This unique position in the flowering plant Tree of Life ( Fig. 5 .8) heightened conservation concern of Amborella, as this single surviving lineage of early angiosperms can provide critical insights into flowering plants. Amborella has now been studied intensively because of its pivotal phylogenetic position. The complete genome of Amborella has been sequenced to provide an evolutionary reference for other flowering plant genomes and for applications in crop science (Amborella Genome Project, 2013) . Amborella provides a baseline for comparison to help interpret gene and genome evolution in more derived flowering plants. Modern crops have highly complex and modified genomes-think of them as sophisticated fighter planes. If you know nothing about flight, these genomes are hard to interpret. Amborella is the genome equivalent of a biplane, providing the context needed to interpret the genomes of more complex, derived angiosperms (e.g., our crops) (Amborella Genome Project, 2013). All of this importance was only attached to Amborella once its position in the Tree of Life was ultimately realized.",

When the numbers of this bird dwindled to a few males, a captive breeding program was designed using females from a geographically close subspecies of seaside sparrow, a program that failed (Avise and Nelson, 1989) . Unfortunately, once a tree of relationships was later constructed for these birds, it revealed that the dusky seaside sparrow was most closely related to a seaside sparrow on the Gulf Coast of Florida rather than to geographically closer seaside sparrows as had been assumed. The captive breeding program should have involved this more closely related Gulf Coast subspecies instead, but insights from phylogeny came too late to save the dusky (Fig. 5.9 ).",

But, two distinct species can appear so similar that biologists may have mistakenly considered them a single species. This topic was covered in Chapter 4. But to review, there are frog species that look nearly identical, but differ in their vocalizations, or calls; although difficult for us to distinguish by appearance, the frogs have no problem distinguishing each other. Similarly, there are plant populations that are very much alike in appearance and differ only in chromosome number-they cannot interbreed and have different environmental ranges. Distinct butterfly species may differ only slightly in spot pattern, or species that appear similar may have different behavior patterns. There are many other examples of cryptic species in other lineages, and they abound in nature, as reviewed in Chapter 4. As a result, we have grossly underestimated the number of species on our planet, even in those parts of the Tree of Life where we think we know a great deal (see Chapter 4). By using DNA sequence data and the Tree of Life, it is possible to more rapidly identify cryptic species. DNA sequence data and tree building (often Figure 5 .9 Dusky seaside sparrow, an example of an organism that is now extinct where conservation efforts were not guided by a tree of relationships. Breeding programs to save the sparrow unfortunately did not pick the closest living relative of the dusky. Free image online. referred to as phylogenetic reconstruction) have been applied to address this question of cryptic species. This approach may reveal that two entities that look similar differ in DNA sequence and have different placements in the Tree of Life. This type of investigation has been applied to several geographic regions thought to harbor large amounts of still undetected biodiversity; using DNA data and comparisons with species already in the Tree of Life can identify such cryptic biological entities quickly (e.g., Lahaye et al., 2008) . Such DNA approaches and use of the Tree of Life are becoming more commonly applied by specialists in the continuing search for as yet undiscovered and unnamed species.",

This can be calculated using a phylogenetic tree and a measure called phylogenetic diversity (PD) (Faith, 1992; Mishler et al., 2014) . Exploring PD is now a major research theme in biodiversity studies. An estimate of PD is not the same as an assessment of either the total number of species or the number of rare species in an area, both commonly used metrics when discussing conversation. While all three measures are incredibly important, they reveal very different things. Imagine two areas in a very simple example (Fig. 5.10 ). Which do you protect? The most species, the rare species, or the largest swathes of the Tree of Life (i.e., protecting PD)? While protecting as many species as possible, especially rare species, is inarguably important, it may be more effective to spend resources to protect PD. Forest et al. (2007) provide an early example of the use of PD and the Tree of Life for conservation. This study showed important implications for conservation in the Cape Region of South Africa, a floristically rich area that is a well-known for its biodiversity. Using a phylogeny for the plants of the region, Forest et al. (2007) revealed that the area with the highest PD did not correspond to the area with the greatest number of rare species, further illustrating that while these measures of biodiversity are not correlated, they are both critical for conservation.",

China is amazing in its extent of plant diversity-the country is home to nearly 10% of the B350,000 species of flowering plants in the world. Using a large phylogenetic tree for all the genera of China, as well as a second tree for the 26,978 named flowering plant species there, it was possible to assess how the major components of the present-day vegetation came together and what areas are home to the highest PD. In their study, Lu et al. (2018) discovered that the flora of eastern China harbors many of the older lineages in China; distant relatives often co-occur in this part of China, and it has higher PD than does western China. In contrast, western China shows the co-occurrence of closely related plants that appear to be the result of recent mountain uplift, the formation of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, and a resulting rapid radiation in that area; as a result, it has lower PD than observed in eastern China (Fig. 5.11 ). These results are important because they identify areas of high PD and provide important data for conservation efforts. For example, the areas of high PD in western China are largely protected, but the same is not the case for areas of high PD in eastern China (Fig. 5.11 ). This lack of preservation of land in eastern China is often due to urbanization and the division of areas into different administrative units. Because the PD data indicate such high biodiversity in eastern China, an effective and supportive argument can be made for the necessity of more connectivity between national parks and nature reserves in that area (Lu et al., 2018) .",

This is made possible because many legumes have special structures on their roots called nodules, which house special bacteria that can convert nitrogen from the air into nitrates that the plant can use.

Every sushi restaurant sampled from Chicago, New York, and Washington, DC, had at least one mislabeled fish (Stern et al., 2017 ; see http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-dna-testing-cantell-you-what-type-of-fish-youre-really-eating-378207/). In Los Angeles sushi restaurants studied over a three-year period, researchers found that 47% of the fish samples were incorrectly labeled (Willette et al., 2017) .",

The logging of dipterocarp forests in southeastern Asia serves as a prime example. Dipterocarps were once the dominant forest trees in much of southeast Asia, but the highly prized wood of these species resulted in their decimation. Some dipterocarp species are rare and endemic to certain small areas and are therefore protected. Consequently, poachers attempt to transport logs of these rare species, which resemble common species, once cut. Using DNA barcodes, however, it is possible to differentiate among dipterocarp species and detect logs of rare species that have been illegally harvested (Finkeldey et al., 2010; Dormontt et al., 2015) . Various other endangered plants and animals can also be smuggled across borders, and DNA sequences and use of the Tree of Life for comparison can similarly be used to identify species listed in the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) appendices (Lahaye et al., 2008) .",

The tropics are home to the greatest proportion of terrestrial biodiversity, and yet many countries in these same areas are often jeopardizing their own future for short-term gain. In these same areas, poor people living outside of large cities in rural areas or remaining areas of rainforest actually depend on biodiversity (a functional Tree of Life) for their well-being and very survival (e.g., Byg et al., 2007; Mertz et al., 2007; Peters et al., 1989) . The long-term goals of conservation efforts and those of native or indigenous peoples are similar-protect the Tree of Life; but the interactions have sometimes been problematic (Dowie, 2009 ). Native peoples should not have to choose between survival and conservation. As noted by Dowie (2009) and paraphrased here, when conservation efforts and indigenous peoples work together and acknowledge the interplay and interdependence of biodiversity conservation and cultural survival, they can produce a novel and more effective conservation paradigm-this is a crucial realization.",

But other examples get less attention, but may be more effective. For example, we consider here the people in the Amazonian area of Guyana. The arapaima, native to the Amazon basin, is the world's largest scaled freshwater fish-they can reach up to 200 kg (400 lb) in weight. Four or five species may currently exist (one or more may be extinct), but they are not well studied so experts are not really sure how many species there are-another great example of our poor understanding of the Tree of Life. Arapaima have long been hunted for food by indigenous peoples of the Amazon. But, with the incursion of Europeans, the arapaima was harvested in large numbers. As a result of this recent overfishing, they are now considered vulnerable to extinction. The species is an unusual, distinctive lineage in the Tree of Life with no close living relatives. However, these fish are also prized for sportsfishing. Recently, catch and release fly fishing was introduced as a means to protect not only this species but also the land of the native peoples where these fish are found-the income and protection of the land also protects the native peoples' way of life. Sports fisherman will pay large amounts to fish for this species. In addition, members of the village serve as fishing guides and cooks. Fishing has made it far more worthwhile to protect the fish than to hunt and eat them (Purnell, 2018) .",

There are numerous reasons to be concerned about a sixth mass extinction and the rapid loss of species over a relatively short time frame-the loss of organisms that directly or indirectly hold the key to cure a human disease or improve the human condition. Many organisms have a hidden value as components to ecosystems-often underappreciated. As aptly stated by May (2011) , \"We are astonishingly ignorant about . . . how many [species] we can lose yet still maintain ecosystem services that humanity ultimately depends upon.\" Ecologists have long evoked a rivet hypothesis (Ehrlich and Ehrlich, 1981) to explain the crucial impact of species loss. Imagine an ecosystem as a large complex airplane, held together with many rivets. As more and more rivets are lost from the airplane (ecosystem), eventually there is a crucial point of malfunction, or collapse-the plane crashes; or in our metaphor, the ecosystem collapses. Furthermore, as species in the ecosystem are lost, the rate of extinction itself increases. As wonderfully stated by E.O. Wilson (2016, p. 14) , \"As more and more species vanish or drop to near extinction, the rate of extinction of the survivors accelerates.\" \"As extinction mounts, biodiversity reaches a tipping point at which the ecosystem collapses.\" This is a possibility that should concern all of us today (e.g., Diamond, 2011).",
