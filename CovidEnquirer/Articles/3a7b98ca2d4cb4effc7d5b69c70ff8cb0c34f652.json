Mutations in recombination-activating gene 1 (RAG1) and RAG2 result in loss or reduction of V(D) J recombination. It is known that different mutations in RAG genes vary in residual recombinase activity and give rise to a broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes. Objective: We sought to study the immunologic mechanisms causing the clinical spectrum of RAG deficiency. Methods: We included 22 patients with similar RAG1 mutations (c.519delT or c.368_369delAA) resulting in N-terminal truncated RAG1 protein with residual recombination activity but presenting with different clinical phenotypes. We studied precursor B-cell development, immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor repertoire formation, receptor editing, and B-and T-cell numbers.",

All patients showed a block in the precursor B-cell development, low B-and T-cell numbers, normal immunoglobulin gene use, limited B-and T-cell repertoires, and slightly impaired receptor editing. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that similar RAG mutations can result in similar immunobiological effects but different clinical phenotypes, indicating that the level of residual recombinase activity is not the only determinant for clinical outcome. We postulate a model in which the type and moment of antigenic pressure affect the clinical phenotypes of these patients. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2014;133:1124-33.) ",

            "text": "Defects in V(D)J recombination result in a block in B-and T-cell differentiation because formation of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptors (TRs) is perturbed. 1 This results in a combined immunodeficiency (CID) of B and T cells. V(D)J recombination is initiated by the recombination-activating gene (RAG) 1 and RAG2 proteins by creating double-stranded breaks in the immunoglobulin and TR loci. Subsequently, these breaks are processed and repaired by proteins involved in nonhomologous end joining. Thus far, genetic defects have been identified in the RAG1, RAG2, Artemis, ligase IV (LIG4), XLF (Cernunnos), and DNA-PKcs genes. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] The immunologic phenotypes and clinical presentations of these mutations are different, depending on the type of genetic defect (ie, null mutations or hypomorphic mutations with residual V[D]J recombination activity). Especially for the RAG genes, many different mutations have been described that give rise to residual activity of the mutated RAG protein. 9 Different RAG mutations can result in a broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes, including severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), RAG deficiency (RAGD) with skin inflammation and ab T-cell expansion (classical Omenn syndrome [OS]), RAGD with skin inflammation but without T-cell expansion (incomplete OS), RAGD with maternofetal transfusion, RAGD with gd T-cell expansion, late-onset SCID, RAGD with granulomas, and RAGD with CD4 cytopenia and thymus hypoplasia. 9, 10 This broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes impedes timely recognition of RAGD and might thus delay treatment (hematopoietic stem cell transplantation). In this study we selected 22 patients with RAGD with similar N-terminal truncating RAG1 mutations to study the effect of a similar mutation on the clinical phenotype. These patients could be divided into 3 main clinical phenotypes (ie, SCID, OS, and CID, which includes the other phenotypes). We studied whether key immunologic parameters (eg, precursor B-cell development, B-and T-cell numbers, and B-and T-cell repertoire) might explain the differences in clinical phenotypes.",

These c.519delT (hereafter abbreviated as delT) and c.368_369delAA (hereafter abbreviated as delAA) mutations have been described before in several patients. 13, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] They were found to be hypomorphic 13, 27 because translation can be reinitiated from the alternative start site methionine 202 (M202) or M183, resulting in an N-terminal truncated RAG1 protein 13 with the same (comparable) residual RAG1 activity (<5% compared with wild type; Fig 1, A) . 13 Sixteen patients were homozygous for the delAA or delT mutation, and 6 patients were compound heterozygous (Table I) . Three RAG1 mutations found on the second allele were also analyzed in the in vitro recombination assay, showing no residual RAG1 activity (Fig 1, A) . In addition, we determined the presence of polymorphisms in the RAG1 gene because these might influence the recombination activity of RAG1. The only polymorphism found was p.Arg249His, which was shown not to affect recombination activity. 2 N-terminal truncating RAG1 mutations result in a spectrum of clinical phenotypes Although all patients had similar RAG1 mutations, resulting in the same N-terminal truncation of the RAG1 protein, the clinical phenotypes varied substantially. The patients could be divided into 3 main clinical phenotypes: ''classical'' T 2 B 2 SCID (n 5 4), OS (n 5 9), and CID (n 5 9, Tables I and II). The patients with ''classical'' SCID were defined as having low B-and T-cell numbers and age at diagnosis before the first year of life. The patients with OS all had generalized and pronounced erythroderma. The patients with CID were given a diagnosis after the first year of life and had greater than 14% gd T cells or normal levels of T cells (P17 and P22). Despite the same N-terminal truncation of RAG1 in the 22 patients, the range of clinical phenotypes strongly suggests that factors other than residual RAG1 activity contribute to the clinical phenotype.",

In healthy children pro-B and pre-BI cells constitute 20% to 25% of the precursor B cells (Fig 1, B) . All patients with ''classical'' SCID and OS, except P13, showed a complete block before the pre-BII-cell stage (Fig 1, B) , whereas most of the patients with CID had a leaky block with greater than 10% pre-BII and immature B cells (Fig 1, B) . RAG1 and RAG2 transcription levels were determined in the BM mononuclear cells to exclude that differences in RAG1 transcription levels caused these difference in precursor B-cell composition. It is known that RAG1 and RAG2 transcription levels are correlated, and that RAG1 and RAG2 levels in BM mononuclear cells depend on the number of cells expressing RAG (pre-BI and pre-BII cells). 30 In all 11 studied patients, the RAG1 transcription level was correlated to RAG2 (Fig 1, C) , indicating that the differences in severity of the precursor B-cell block were not caused by differences in expression of RAG1. B-cell numbers in PB were undetectable or very low in most patients, except P15, who had normal levels (Table II) . Correlating the percentage of pre-BII and immature cells in BM with the number of peripheral B cells showed that only patients with greater than 10% pre-BII and immature B cells in BM (P13, P14, P15, P16, and P17) had detectable B cells in PB. Collectively, these data indicate that most patients with CID have a milder block in the precursor B-cell composition and that only patients with a leaky block have detectable B cells in the PB.",

The frequency of unique sequences in IGH genes was significantly lower in patients with RAGD than in control subjects (Table III) , which is a reflection of the low numbers of B cells present in PB. Despite the low recombination activity, IGHV, IGHD, and IGHJ gene use was not restricted (Fig 2 and see Fig E1 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). Forty-eight of the 57 IGHV genes used in control subjects were identified in the patients with RAGD because were the 25 IGHD genes and all 6 IGHJ genes. IGHV, IGHD, and IGHJ gene uses were similar to those seen in control subjects, although some genes were used with different frequencies (Fig 2 and see Fig E1) . Most strikingly, JH6 use was lower whereas JH4 use was higher compared with that seen in control subjects. The patients with RAGD had a significantly lower frequency (5.9% to 6.2% vs 20.9% to 24.3% in control subjects) of unproductive rearrangements (Table III) , as reported previously. 31 Unproductive rearrangements were defined as out-of-frame rearrangements or rearrangements with a stop codon. Therefore even though the patients with RAGD had reduced V(D)J recombination, leading to a limited TR and immunoglobulin repertoire, the IGH gene use was similar to that seen in control subjects without preferential use of the proximal or distal genes.",

Unfortunately, the thymic architecture and autoimmune regulator and tissue-specific antigen expression could not be studied in our patients, but we were able to evaluate 3 parameters in the IGH sequences that are associated with autoimmunity. These are characterized by long CDR3s, and the frequency of IGHV4-34, which is known to encode intrinsically self-reactive cold agglutinin antibodies that recognize carbohydrate antigens on erythrocytes. 38, 39 The distribution of the CDR3 length of the unique junctions in BM and PB was similar to that seen in control subjects (Fig 3, A) , except patient 18, who seemed to have increased numbers of junctions with a CDR3 of 16 and 22 amino acids. These junctions with a CDR3 length of 22 amino acids displayed high similarity (Fig 3, B) . No sequence similarity was found when all 16-amino-acid CDR3s were compared (Fig 3, B) , but 18.3% of these junctions used IGHV6-1, and all these junctions had a highly similar CDR3 sequence (Fig 3, B) , which suggests that they might recognize a common antigenic determinant. The frequency of long CDR3s (> _15 amino acids) was significantly lower in P15 and P16 (P < .0001) but not in P18 (Fig 3, C) . The frequency of IGHV4-34 use was significantly higher in P16 (P < .0001) and P18 (P < .0001 ; Fig 3, D) . From the 3 patients we analyzed, P18 had autoimmunity, which was reflected by the high frequency of IGHV4-34 use.",

In 11 patients TRECs were not detectable, and in the other 4 patients (P2, P5, P7, and P18), the number of TRECs/50 ng of DNA was less than 1 compared with 134 6 75 TRECs/50 ng of DNA in control subjects (n 5 7; age, 8 months to 11 years; data not shown), meaning that the T cells that were present in these patients showed extensive proliferation. Furthermore, the T-cell repertoire was determined by testing the TRB gene rearrangements in 2 patients with ''classical'' SCID, 3 patients with OS, and 2 patients with CID. In all patients the TRB repertoire was clearly restricted (Fig 4) . Taken together, the T cells that were present in the patients with RAGD showed extensive proliferation and had a restricted TR repertoire.",

            "text": "Many different RAG1 mutations have been reported to the RAG mutation database. 42 Although most are null mutations, several have been described to result in residual recombinase activity. 11, 13, 25, 27, 43 Previously, it was hypothesized that null mutations in RAG1 would result in ''classical'' T 2 B 2 SCID and that partial reduction of RAG activity would result in OS or an intermediate late-onset SCID or OS phenotype. 28 Over the last few years, the spectrum of reported clinical phenotypes of RAGD has broadened and now also includes RAGD with gd T-cell expansion, RAGD with skin inflammation but without T-cell expansion (incomplete OS), RAGD with granulomas, RAGD with maternofetal transfusion, and RAGD with CD4 cytopenia and thymus hypoplasia. 9,10 A few case reports have shown that the same RAG mutation can result in a different clinical phenotype. 25, 29, 44, 45 This study is the first to report an in-depth immunobiological evaluation of 22 patients with RAGD with similar RAG1 mutations, resulting in the same N-terminal truncation of the RAG1 protein. These similar mutations result in 3 different clinical phenotypes, which indicates that a specific mutation does not predict a patient's clinical phenotype. Because all patients had similar mutations, the residual RAG1 protein activity was expected to be comparable among all patients. The N-terminally truncated RAG1 protein is produced through translation starting from an alternative start site (M183 or M202), and hence the amount of protein is dependent on how efficiently these start sites are used. Because the RAG1 transcription level correlated with that of RAG2, we assume that all patients had similar expression of the mutant RAG1 protein (Fig 1, C) . We cannot exclude that epigenetics and modifier genes accounted for small differences in RAG1 protein expression. Although a previous attempt to identify such modifier genes in human subjects was not successful, 46 studies in mouse models could shed more light on the contribution of epigenetics and modifier genes.",

As a consequence of the reduced V(D)J recombination, fewer B and T cells with a functional receptor can be produced. The proliferation of the lymphocytes is increased to compensate for low circulating B-and T-cell numbers. This idea is corroborated by the low numbers of TRECs in patients with RAGD. The increased proliferation of T cells might result in normal or increased T-cell counts, especially in the patients with OS; however, the corresponding TR repertoire in all the patients with RAGD remains restricted.",

In addition, these mice had increased serum B cell-activating factor levels, which might rescue autoreactive B-cell clones. This increase in serum B cell-activating factor levels was also seen in patients with RAG-, Artemis-, and X-linked SCID. 37 Similar to observations in mice, most patients with RAGD did not use the IGKJ5 gene, whereas IGKV gene use was normal. This suggests that receptor editing in this group of patients with RAGD was slightly impaired, which can either be a result of reduced recombination activity caused by the RAG1 mutation or by low B-cell numbers leading to reduced selection against autoreactive B cells. The IGH repertoire was investigated for long CDR3s and increased IGHV4-34 use, which are associated with autoreactive antibodies. 47, 48 From the 3 patients with RAGD we analyzed, only P18 had autoimmunity, which was reflected by an increased VH4-34 gene use.",

On the basis of our results and earlier reported data, we propose an explanatory model for the development of different clinical phenotypes in patients with RAGD with similar mutations (Fig 5) . If RAGD results in reduced V(D)J recombination, low B-and T-cell numbers are produced with some (compensatory) clonal expansion. This expansion might increase the B-and T-cell numbers to even normal levels but does not change the limited repertoire. In such limited repertoire the selection against autoreactive cells is impaired. Provided the deficient immune system is not activated, patients with RAGD are asymptomatic. However, when the immune system will be activated by potentially a wide range of different (auto)antigens, the type of antigen and activated effector lymphocyte will have important consequences for the clinical phenotype. In addition, the impaired negative and positive selection of thymic lymphocytes and reduced number of regulatory T cells might result in autoimmunity when patients are exposed to autoantigens. This phenomenon can occur at any early stage, even in utero, as shown by the fact that patients with OS can have severe erythroderma already at birth, which is unlikely to be triggered by infections. Additionally, directly after birth, the skin and gastrointestinal tract become colonized by commensal bacteria, which can trigger the chronic diarrhea seen in most patients with RAGD. Key steps in the development of a certain clinical phenotype will be the B-and T-cell repertoire, the type of (auto)antigen exposure, the specificity of the antigen receptors and timing, the cell type involved in the immune activation, and the potential influence of genetic variations in modifier genes. Variability in any of these factors might eventually lead to different clinical phenotypes, despite a similar genetic defect.",
