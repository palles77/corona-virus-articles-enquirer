            "text": "Background: All types of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) are caused by the aberrant myogenic activation of the somatically silent DUX4 gene, which initiates a cascade of cellular events ultimately leading to FSHD pathophysiology. Therefore, FSHD is a dominant gain-of-function disease that is amenable to modeling by DUX4 overexpression. However, there is large variability in the patient population. Typically, progressive skeletal muscle weakness becomes noticeable in the second or third decade of life, yet there are many genetically FSHD individuals who develop symptoms much later in life or remain relatively asymptomatic throughout their lives. Conversely, in rare cases, FSHD may present clinically prior to 5-10 yrs of age, ultimately manifesting as a very severe early onset form of the disease. Thus, there is a need to control the timing and severity of pathology in FSHD-like models. Methods: We have recently described a line of conditional DUX4 transgenic mice, FLExDUX4, that develop a myopathy upon induction of human DUX4-fl expression in skeletal muscle. Here, we use the FLExDUX4 mouse crossed with the skeletal muscle-specific and tamoxifen inducible line ACTA1-MerCreMer to generate a highly versatile bi-transgenic mouse model with chronic, lowlevel DUX4-fl expression and mild pathology, that can be induced to develop more severe FSHD-like pathology in a dose-dependent response to tamoxifen. We identified conditions to reproducibly generate models exhibiting mild, moderate, or severe DUX4-dependent pathophysiology, and characterized their progression. Results: We assayed DUX4-fl mRNA and protein levels, fitness, strength, global gene expression, histopathology, and immune response, all of which are consistent with an FSHD-like myopathic phenotype. Importantly, we identified sex-specific and muscle-specific differences that should be considered when using these models for preclinical studies. Conclusions: The ACTA1-MCM;FLExDUX4 bi-transgenic mouse model expresses a chronic low level of DUX4-fl and has mild pathology and detectable muscle weakness. The onset and progression of moderate to severe pathology can be controlled via tamoxifen injection to provide consistent and readily screenable phenotypes for assessing therapies targeting DUX4-fl mRNA and protein. Thus, these FSHD-like mouse models can be used to study a range of DUX4-fl expression and pathology dependent upon investigator need, through controlled mosaic expression of DUX4.",

            "text": "In addition to the complex genetic and epigenetic conditions that are required to develop clinical FSHD, the pathogenic mechanism is also unusual among neuromuscular diseases. While FSHD is an autosomal dominant gain-of-function disease, the pathogenic DUX4 gene is typically expressed in only a small fraction (<1%) of myocytes, ultimately leading to debilitating muscle pathology over time [8, 16, 26]. This may account in part for the more common adult onset of clinical symptoms in FSHD patients [27, 28] . In addition, it appears that FSHD pathology is caused by sporadic bursts of increased DUX4-fl expression in differentiated myocytes, which are epigenetically suppressed in healthy and asymptomatic subjects [9, 19, 29] .",

These DUX4-mediated changes, either alone or in combination, lead to progressive muscle cell death and ultimately pathology [10, 18] .

Upon Cre-mediated induction, the transgene recombines to express DUX4-fl under control of the Rosa26 gene promoter ( Figure 1A ). Importantly, since many elements within DUX4 are prime targets for sequence-based therapies [42] [43] [44] [45] , the DUX4 transgene maintains the exon/intron structure of the endogenous human gene, Male ACTA1-MCM mice were crossed with female Rosa26 NZG mice to assess induction of Cremediated recombination using our TMX dosage regimens.

DUX4-fl encodes a paired homeobox domain transcription factor (DUX4-FL) normally expressed in healthy human testis, pluripotent cells, and cleavage-stage embryos, and the DUX4-mediated transcriptional program is key for zygotic genome activation, all of which supports an important role for DUX4-FL during early embryonic development [5, 8, [20] [21] [22] [23] . Adult somatic cells from healthy individuals are typically devoid of detectable DUX4-fl expression [8, 15, 16] . However, individuals meeting the genetic criteria for FSHD express stable DUX4-fl mRNA and protein in their skeletal muscles, which aberrantly activates an embryonic gene expression profile [8, 15, 16, 24, 25] , ultimately leading to FSHD pathophysiology. Interestingly, low somatic expression of DUX4-fl mRNA per se is not necessarily pathogenic since expression can be detected in some rare cultures of myogenic cells and muscle biopsies from healthy and asymptomatic FSHD subjects, albeit at levels significantly lower than in equivalent cells and tissues from FSHD-affected subjects [9, 16, 17] . Epigenetic analysis of the pathogenic 4q D4Z4 RU shows that the stability of DUX4 epigenetic repression correlates with disease presentation among healthy, FSHD1-affected, and FSHD1-asymptomatic subjects [9] . Together, this data supports that the level of somatic DUX4-fl expression, which is inducible and affected by the epigenetic stability in the region, is the key determinant of disease onset and severity.",

Stained sections were dehydrated with a series of 1 min ethanol washes (70%, 95%, and 100%), cleared with xylene for 5 min, and mounted. A series of micrographs from each muscle section were captured using a 10X objective on a Leica DM2000 and reconstituted to form a whole muscle cross-section using LAS 4.12 software (Leica Microsystems, Inc.). Whole cross-section images were divided into 3-5 sections and processed with MATLAB (Mathworks) to determine the number of pixels stained red and the total number of pixels stained. Muscles from 3-6 mice for each treatment were analyzed. Significance was calculated by one-way ANOVA using Prism 7 (Graphpad).",

However, preclinical testing for different candidate FSHD therapeutics targeting DUX4-fl mRNA and protein expression in these mice will likely require different criteria, such as degree and progression of pathophysiology, dependent upon the approach.

            "text": "The FLExD hemizygous mice showed no transgene recombination in the absence of Cre, and the bi-transgenic animals showed variable low levels (2-10%) of transgene recombination in skeletal muscles, but not in heart or liver, in the absence of TMX, due to the above-mentioned sporadic leaky nuclear Cre activity in ACTA1-MCM mice. When injected with TMX to induce Cre nuclear activity and stimulate transgene recombination in skeletal muscles, the bi-transgenic mice showed increased recombination (8-30%) in response to the low TMX dose and an even higher level of recombination (38-55%) in response to the high TMX dose. Surprisingly, in all three bi-transgenic models (no, low, and high TMX) there were muscle-specific differences in the transgene recombination rate; however, these differences were consistent between the TMX treated lines ( Figure 1B ). For example, quadriceps muscles showed the lowest recombination in both TMX-induced models, followed by the tibialis anterior (TA) and gastrocnemius muscles with intermediate levels, while the diaphragm and soleus showed the highest recombination levels. As expected when using the ACTA1-MCM driver line, the heart and liver showed no transgene recombination in any of the bi-transgenic animals. Since this assay measures transgene recombination of a single copy transgene per nucleus, the results showing less than 100% recombination represent mosaic recombination which should translate into the desired mosaic DUX4-fl transgene expression. We conclude that we have identified three conditions that reproducibly produce differing levels of mosaic transgene recombination, which we will refer to as mild, moderate, and severe (Table 1) , based on the subsequent characterizations described below. Importantly for future studies, we show that different skeletal muscles show different levels of recombination in response to these TMX treatments. To assess if the variable rates of transgene recombination in each model translated similarly to variable levels of protein expression at the single nucleus level, muscle tissues were analyzed by immunofluorescence (IF) using an anti-DUX4-FL antibody. Mosaic patterns of nuclear DUX4-FL expression were readily detected in cross sections of TA muscle from all three models ( Figure 2 ). The bi-transgenic ACTA1-MCM;FLExD mice showed few DUX4-FL positive nuclei in the absence of TMX ( Figure 2M and N), consistent with a very low level of transgene recombination ( Figure 1B) . However, since DUX4-FL is cytotoxic and it is not known how long DUX4-FL expressing cells may remain in the muscles, an IF time course study was performed for the TMX-injected mice. The low-dose mice, which appeared to be moderately affected phenotypically over time and will be referred to as the moderate FSHD-like model (Table 1 , discussed in detail below), were assayed over 28 DPI. DUX4-FL expression appeared by 3 DPI (moderate day 3, or MD3), peaking at MD14, and then was greatly reduced by MD28, likely due to the death of DUX4-positive cells (Figure 2A -J). Mice injected with the high-dose TMX regimen were so severely affected by 9 DPI that they had to be sacrificed and could not be assessed further. These mice, which will be referred to as the severe FSHD-like model, similarly showed DUX4-FL expression by three days after the first injection (severe day 3, or SD3) and peak DUX4-FL expression at SD9. Overall, bi-transgenic mice without TMX (referred to as the mild FSHD-like model) exhibited very low numbers of DUX4-FL-positive myonuclei, with the moderate model exhibiting increased numbers, and the severe model the highest numbers.",

Since DUX4-FL functions as a transcriptional activator in both human and mouse cells [30, 68] , expression of DUX4-FL direct target genes has proven to be a more accurate indicator of DUX4-FL expression levels in both species [24, 31, 41] .

Therefore, male and female mice were analyzed separately to assess potential sex differences in presentation of the phenotypes. The treadmill analysis protocol consisted of running the mice on a slightly inclined treadmill, slowly increasing the speed until the mice could not run any longer, and measuring the time to fatigue, with a maximum assay time of 20 min. We found these particular conditions (see Methods) provided highly consistent results and a readily assayable window for these three mouse models.

This decline remained at MD16 before beginning to recover to ~4 min running at MD23 and ~10 min by MD29. In comparison, all male moderate model mice showed a significant decline starting at MD6 (running ~15 min) which progressed more slowly than in females, running for ~10 min at MD10 and ~5 min at MD14 and MD17 before recovering to ~15 min by MD28. Overall, although all moderately affected mice showed significant declines in treadmill fitness over the course of four weeks, female mice were more severely affected and recovered more slowly than male mice. For the severe model mice, female mice declined more rapidly than males, although both showed a significant decline in running time before fatigue, decreasing by over 10 min compared with controls by SD5, a point at which the moderate model mice were still unaffected.",

EDL muscles isolated from the mild model bi-transgenic mice (no TMX) were initially compared with age-matched ACTA1-MCM mice (control) treated with the appropriate dose of TMX for the respective group isolated at TMX D14 or TMX D10 from the first injection. Interestingly, despite having similar treadmill endurance profiles as controls ( Figure 4 ), the female bi-transgenic mice (no TMX) consistently showed significantly lower maximum absolute force and specific force measurements (maximum force normalized by cross sectional area: CSA) compared with controls ( Figure 5 and S4). Male bi-transgenic mice, however, were less affected and only showed a significant strength difference from controls with respect to maximum twitch force and maximum force frequency ( Figure S4D -F), and no significant change in specific force measurements. However, both male and female bi-transgenic mild models were significantly less responsive to mid-level and high stimulation frequencies (65-180 Hz) compared with controls ( Figure 5C and S4). We conclude that chronic, low, mosaic DUX4-FL expression in even a few myofibers reproducibly produced a measurable decrease in isometric contractile strength of muscle that does not appear to affect treadmill fitness. Thus, this data suggests that these mild bi-transgenic (no TMX) mice may present a model of presymptomatic FSHD or an early symptomatic mild FSHD.",

Genes with significant differential expression (>2-fold) from the ACTA1-MCM controls were identified (Table S2 ). The ACTA1-MCM/+ and FLExD/+ single transgenic mice only showed 3 genes differentially expressed (2 upregulated and 1 downregulated) between the mice ( Figure 6A and Table S2 ), which is consistent with our previous qRT-PCR studies showing no significant differences in expression of DUX4-fl or several prominent DUX4-FL targets between these mice [41] . In contrast, the transcriptomes for both the moderate and severe models were significantly different from the ACTA1-MCM controls when analyzing genes significantly misregulated >2-fold ( Figure 6B , C, and Table S2 ). The However, when these DUX4-induced genes (>2-fold) from murine skeletal muscle were compared with differential gene expression profiles from human FSHD patient muscle biopsies [24] there was very little overlap, with only 127 upregulated genes and 10 downregulated genes being the same (Table S3 ).

DUX4 is pro-apoptotic and its expression is detrimental to muscle development and differentiation [19, 34, 36-38, 73, 75, 77-80] . Expression of DUX4 stimulates genes that modulate the immune response [30] , and FSHD patient biopsies show expression of immune genes, features of inflammation visualized by MRI, and immune cell infiltration [24, [81] [82] [83] [84] . Therefore, we performed a gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis on the differentially expressed genes from the FSHD-like moderate and severe mouse models Table S4  2 Genes enriched for each comparison are listed in Table S5 DUX4-FL expression has been shown to inhibit nonsense-mediated decay, resulting in accumulation of mRNAs that would be typical substrates for NMD [33] . Therefore, we analyzed the RNA-seq data for aberrant alternative splicing events resulting in skipped exons (SE) or retained introns (RI) using MISO [56] . MISO identifies alternative splicing events based on predefined splicing events, taking advantage of existing knowledge and therefore is more accurate in characterizing alternative splicing events in RNA-seq data. The MISO analysis of the RNA-seq data revealed that the moderate and severe disease models had significant increases in SE and RI events and that the severe model had significantly more SE and RI events than the moderate model (Tables 3 and S6 ). This data supports that increased DUX4-fl expression and increased disease severity is correlated with increased SE and RI, which suggests a decrease in RNA quality control.

The initial analysis of the mouse models showed different, muscle-specific levels of transgene recombination in all three bi-transgenic severity models ( Figure 1) . Therefore, cryosections for histological analysis were generated from multiple muscles, including TA, gastrocnemius, soleus, quadriceps, and heart, for all three models. These muscle sections were then analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining to assess fiber morphology, TUNEL assay to assess apoptosis, embryonic myosin heavy chain (eMyHC/Myh3) IF to assess muscle fiber regeneration, picrosirius red (SR) staining to assess fibrosis, and CD11b and Ly6G IF to assess immune cell infiltration. The previously described time-courses of treadmill exhaustion running were performed using female mice for the moderate model, with (Figure 10) . Importantly, as seen in the mild model, these models showed anatomical muscle-specific differences in histopathogenic features, correlating with muscle-specific levels of transgene recombination ( Figure 1B) , consistent with DUX4-FL expression leading to an atrophic phenotype [34] . For example, the soleus muscle, which shows the highest level of TMX-responsive transgene recombination, also appears to have the greatest degree of histopathology for each model, including mononuclear cell infiltration, disrupted muscle integrity ( Figure 8K , O, S and Figure 9O , S), and fibers with centralized nuclei (Figure 10 ). The quadriceps showed the lowest level of transgene recombination and similarly showed the least amount of histopathology for the analyzed skeletal muscles. The heart, which showed no transgene recombination or expression, did not show any pathology even in the severe model ( Figure S6) . Overall, the skeletal muscle histopathology in these models was progressive, appearing with peak DUX4-FL expression levels at MD14 in the moderate model while appearing earlier in the severe model (SD6), and peaking with DUX4-FL levels at SD9. This further supports that the extent of pathology in these mouse models correlates with the level of transgene recombination ( Figure 1B ) and DUX4-fl expression (Figure 2 and 3) .",

While the human DUX4 gene has a conserved developmental role with Dux family members found in other mammals, including the mouse, there is significant divergence at the DNA and protein sequence level as well as in the spectrum of species-specific target genes [23, 70, 104] . In addition, because DUX4-FL is highly cytotoxic for many somatic cells, leaky expression during development has been problematic, and surviving mice can be severely phenotypic and difficult to breed [75] . However, the FLExD mice we recently developed overcame many of these previous limitations [41] . Both male and female mice are fertile and easy to breed, male or female transgenic mice can be produced either as transgene heterozygotes or homozygotes, which can live more than 1.5 years, and, when mated with an inducible Cre line of mice, bi-transgenic mice allow for investigator-controlled expression of DUX4-fl mRNA and protein resulting in FSHD-like muscle pathology [41] . Here we report the characterization of a series of phenotypic FSHD-like mouse models varying in severity from mild to severe, generated using the FLExD conditional DUX4-fl transgenic mouse line crossed with ACTA1-MCM TMXinducible mice. We demonstrate that these bi-transgenic mouse models, with and without TMX induction, recapitulate many aspects of FSHD pathophysiology with variable severity, thus providing suitable models for therapeutic interventions targeting DUX4-fl mRNA, protein, and certain downstream pathways, with several key caveats. In particular, it is important for those working on these models to keep in mind the described anatomical muscle-specific and sexspecific differences in pathology and disease progression.

Thus, in the ACTA1-MCM;FLExD bi-transgenic mice, this results in recombination of the DUX4 transgene and low mosaic expression of DUX4-FL protein in skeletal muscles throughout their lifetime. Importantly, although this leaky recombination is specific to skeletal muscle, it is not uniform among skeletal muscles, with different anatomical muscles exhibiting different, but consistent, levels of recombination and thus DUX4-fl expression ( Figure 1B , e.g. soleus is low and quadriceps is high). Thus, the situation in this mild model is similar to that in pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic FSHD patients. These mice live with a chronic, low-level, mosaic expression of DUX4-FL in a fraction (<10%) of muscle fibers, yet phenotypically the mice appear healthy and behave normally, with no changes in overall fitness or lifespan.",

The mild phenotype manifests as increased expression of DUX4-FL target genes (Figure 3 ), decreased expression of Mstn ( Figure S7 ), 5-10% of myofibers with centralized nuclei at 10-12 weeks of age (Figures 7 and 8) , and 40% decreased capacity for muscle force generation in female (but not male) mice, assayed ex vivo (Figures 5,   S4 and S5). There are also small but significant differences between males and females with respect to histology and centralized nuclei that need to be taken in to account. Overall, there is some low-level muscle pathology and new fiber regeneration, however, the mice do not exhibit increased apoptosis, immune cell infiltration, or increased fibrosis. The model is readily scalable, highly reproducible, and, considering that these mice live >1.5yrs (female n=43, male n=20), provides a DUX4-fl expression model that is amenable to longevity studies for efficacy of putative DUX4-targeted therapeutics. Thus, while the mild model is likely the easiest to work with and imposes no time limits on treatments, investigators should be careful in choosing which sex to use (or use a significant number of both sexes and analyze them separately), which age to use, and which muscles to assay or treat.",

The moderate model mice also showed significant differences between male and females with respect to weight ( Figure S3 ), treadmill profiles (Figure 4) , and muscle physiology ( Figures 5 and S4) , with females being more severely affected by all metrics. With respect to appearance and progression of pathology, the mice show further reduction in Mstn expression, and, as opposed to the mild model, the moderate model mice showDUX4-induced apoptosis ( Figure 12 ) and recruitment of immune cells to the damaged muscle ( Figure 14) . DUX4-FL protein expression, apoptosis, and immune cell recruitment all peak at MD14, at which point there is also an increase in eMyHC positive, newly regenerated fibers as wells as fibrosis (Figures 16 and S8 ). Muscles at this stage produce ~60% of the force produced by ACTA1-MCM controls ( Figure 5 ). Analysis of global differential gene expression supports the activation of apoptosis, the immune response, and the cell cycle, all three of which are much larger groupings than enriched in C2C12 cells expressing DUX4. This illustrates a key difference between performing studies in vitro using single cell types overexpressing DUX4 compared with studies of intact muscle expressing mosaic levels of DUX4 and containing all associated cell types (Figure 7) .",

This is likely because DUX4-FL positive myofibers die and are being repaired and replaced using satellite cells that did not undergo transgene recombination, and thus have not activated DUX4 expression. Therefore, it is imperative to have the proper controls when using these models for preclinical testing of therapeutics. However, this also presents an opportunity whereby the mice can be re-injected with TMX at some point during treatment and progressive decline of the model can be assessed over several months. Preliminary experiments in our lab suggest that this is a viable possibility that needs further investigation and characterization. In addition, TMX can be adjusted to single higher-dose injections or multiple lower-dose injections to refine the model to meet investigational needs.

These mice do not show any signs of recovery. As in the moderate model, there are consistently different levels of transgene recombination and DUX4-fl expression among different anatomical muscles ( Figure 1B) . However, different muscles show the same patterns as in the moderate model (e.g., soleus is highest and quadriceps is lowest for both models), supporting the idea that accessibility to the TMX that is responsible for the variability. In addition, as seen for both the mild and moderate models, females and males of the severe model showed sex-specific differences, with females again being more severely affected. ",

A key feature of these models is that the ACTA1-MCM;FLExD bi-transgenic mice express chronic low-level mosaic and skeletal muscle-specific DUX4-fl mRNA and protein. Thus, the moderate and severe models are not introducing DUX4 expression to a naive system, instead providing a situation similar to the bursts of DUX4 expression seen in FSHD myocytes [19] .

Since there was no indication of recombination in the R26 NZG single transgenic animals treated with TMX (Figure S1B), we interpret this result as indicating a low level of MerCreMer protein leaking into the nucleus in the absence of TMX, either at a level that only occasionally leads to recombination or the protein is only sporadically leaky into a few nuclei. Regardless, this suggested that bi-transgenic animals generated with the ACTA1-MCM line may be useful for generating very low mosaic expression of a transgene in the absence of TMX induction. Overall, we concluded that the ACTA1-MCM line of mice was suitable for generating a range of mosaic transgene expression models.Generating FSHD-like model mice with differing levels of pathophysiology required adjusting the level of mosaicism with respect to DUX4-fl expression. Therefore, ACTA1-MCM mice were crossed with FLExD mice[41] (Figure 1A), and 13-14 week old ACTA1-MCM;FLExD bi-transgenic mice were treated with the above TMX dosing regimens to induce",

Sex and agematched ACTA1-MCM mice injected with appropriate levels of TMX for the model were used as controls and the mild bi-transgenic (No TMX) model mice were assayed for comparison (D0). Analysis of the H&E histology indicated that for the mild model muscles (Figure 8E-H and Figure 9E-H), very low mosaic DUX4-fl expression leads to minor changes in histology, the most notable being increased centralized nuclei compared with ACTA1-MCM control muscles (Figure 10). Interestingly, there are anatomical muscle-specific effects that correlate with the level of transgene recombination. The soleus muscles, which have the lowest levels of leaky transgene recombination in muscle assayed for the mild model, have ~3% myofibers with central nuclei, while the TA muscles, which have a higher recombination rate and thus more DUX4-FLexpressing nuclei (Figure 1B), have ~10% myofibers with central nuclei (Figure 10), suggesting that DUX4-FL expression is driving the formation of fibers with central nuclei. In contrast to the mild model, the histology from the moderate (Figure 8I-X) and severe (Figure 9I-T) model mice showed greater effects of DUX4-fl expression, including variability in skeletal muscle fiber size, round and triangular fiber shapes, significant increases in centralized an influx of mononuclear cells, and ultimately an apparent decrease in structural integrity of the muscle. This histopathology accumulated over time and correlated with loss of muscle function. For example, in the moderate model histology, the few mononuclear cells that have infiltrated by MD6 dramatically increase by MD14. Similarly, the percentage of fibers with centralized nuclei jumps significantly between MD6 and MD14 and MD28 in both the soleus and TA",
