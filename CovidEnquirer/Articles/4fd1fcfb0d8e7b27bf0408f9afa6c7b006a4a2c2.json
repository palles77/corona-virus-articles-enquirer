Viruses as a distinct biological entity, however, were not discovered until 1892 when Ivanovsky identified non-bacterial pathogens affecting tobacco plants. 1 Subsequent work by Beijerink, Loeffler, and Frosch in 1898 distinguished the tobacco mosaic disease and footand-mouth disease agents from pathogenic bacteria and recorded their 'obligate parasite' nature. 2, 3 The first recorded human illness to be confirmed of viral origin was yellow fever in 1901, a discovery made by Reed et al. 4 Since then, large numbers of viral pathogens have been identified.",

Type A is the cause of worldwide pandemics, whereas types B and C tend to produce more localized outbreaks and milder forms. Antigenic drift because of minor changes in the NA or HA glycoproteins accounts for epidemics. Antigenic drift tends to lead to less severe disease in individuals pre-exposed to the antecedent virus. Major changes in the HA, called antigenic shift, because of the acquisition of new gene segments can result in pandemics of very severe influenza.

Current UK guidance states that all patients with complicated influenza infection should receive antiviral treatment. Antiviral treatment should be commenced as early as possible and should be given on clinical suspicion irrespective of the onset of illness and before laboratory confirmation of influenza virus infection. 7 Oseltamivir is to be used for immunocompetent patients. The evidence for use is a reduction in symptoms or disease severity (strongest evidence if started within 48 h of illness onset). Further studies are needed to clarify if there is survival benefit in patients at risk of developing complicated influenza or in patients in whom complications have developed. Zanamivir is reserved for patients who are immunocompromised.

Hendra virus, Nipah virus and Newcastle disease virus are zoonotic infections and are not transmitted from human-to-human and will not be discussed here. Respiratory syncytial virus RSV predominantly causes severe disease in children in the first year of life leading to bronchiolitis and pneumonia. It can be particularly severe in premature children, those with chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, neuromuscular disorders, or immunodeficiency. Prophylaxis with i.m. palivizumab has been considered for high-risk individuals. In the adult population (re-infections), RSV usually causes mild, self-limiting URT symptoms, or flu-like illness. However, it becomes an increasingly recognized cause of pneumonia in the immunocompromised, the elderly ( particularly those with chronic lung or heart disease) and residents of long-term care facilities. RSV outbreaks commonly coincide with influenza pandemics. These can go undetected, and the deaths attributed to influenza unless the appropriate laboratory diagnostic tests are used. Infection is confirmed by detecting the viral genome by RT -PCR in URT or LRT specimens (see influenza diagnosis). Aerosolized ribavirin is of benefit in treating RSV infections of the immunocompromised patient but is not used for the immunocompetent. 8 This approach is supported by experience in stem cell transplant populations in whom treatment confers mortality benefit.

Clinical symptoms in the immunocompetent, when present, include gingivostomatitis, genital herpes, conjunctivitis, keratitis, encephalitis and severe disseminated neonatal HSV infection. In the immunocompromised these include pneumonia, hepatitis, colitis and encephalitis which may require organ support. HSV encephalitis presents with pyrexia, altered consciousness, bizarre behaviour, disordered mentation, psychiatric symptoms, seizures and localized neurological signs and must be considered as a potential cause in such patients as it is treatable with aciclovir. Typically CSF analysis will show a clear appearance with a high white cell count (lymphocytes), a normal or slightly raised protein and a normal CSF glucose: plasma ratio. PCR for HSV in CSF will confirm the diagnosis in most patients although it may be negative in the first few days of disease. 13 The mortality is around six times higher in immunocompromised patients. HSV pneumonia can be seen in immunocompromised patients and is best diagnosed by performing HSV PCR of LRT specimens. HSV is particularly responsive to treatment with aciclovir, a guanine analogue with specific cytotoxicity for HSV-infected cells. This selectivity is, in part, due to the presence of HSV thymidine kinase in infected cells. This activates aciclovir by monophosphorylation, a process that host cell thymidine kinase cannot perform.",

Importantly, this group of viruses can establish a latent stage of infection (without any virus replication) but can reactivate from latency to produce an infectious virus again periodically. They express a large numbers of enzymes and other proteins involved in DNA synthesis, virus replication, latency, and immune evasion. The level of virus replication during reactivations is controlled in immunocompetent individuals by the cell-mediated (T cell) immune response.The herpesviridae are subdivided into alpha, beta, and gamma subfamilies. Viral infection by alpha-herpes viruses (HSVs 1 and 2 and VZV) causes ballooning of the cells and the formation of multinucleated giant cells leading to cell death in the parabasal and intermediate cells of the epithelium. With cell lysis, clear fluid containing large amounts of infectious virus particles accumulates to form vesicles between the epidermal and dermal layers of skin and mucosal surfaces. Alpha-HSVs can invade and replicate in the CNS and establish latency in dorsal root ganglia. The beta-HSVs group (CMV, HHV-6, and HHV-7) have an affinity for lymphocytes and monocytes and cause infected cells to become enlarged (cytomegaly). The gamma-HSVs (EBV and HHV-8) are also lymphotropic and have oncogenic potential. Patients with compromised cell-mediated immune systems can present with severe herpes virus infections.",

(ii) Placental transfer of CMV: this occurs in 40% patients after primary CMV infection in pregnancy and congenital CMV infection can lead to severe fetal brain damage, or less severe damage, such as sensorineural hearing loss and intellectual impairment, only identified months or years after birth or completely asymptomatic. (iii) Infectious mononucleosis can occur with a similar presentation to that caused by EBV. (iv) Reactivation in the immunocompromised patient: this is the commonest reason for patients to require ICU admission. This can lead to disseminated infection or localized disease such as retinitis or pneumonia In HIV patients, once the CD4 count decreases ,50-200 cells ml 21 , patients can develop CMV retinitis, but pneumonia is rare. This is in contrast to bone marrow transplant patients who are at high risk of developing CMV pneumonitis with lower incidence of retinitis.Serological tests can be used to identify CMV infection. IgM antibodies usually appear within a week of infection followed 1 -2 days later by an increase in IgG levels. IgM subsequently decreases to low or undetectable levels over a few months, whereas IgG levels will remain detectable life-long, indicating previous infection. CMV-PCR can also be used to detect CMV infection using blood, saliva, urine, and other bodily fluids. The detection of CMV in damaged tissue is required to confirm CMV end-organ disease. Histology can also confirm active CMV infection by identifying basophilic intranuclear 'owl's eye' inclusions. Treatment with ganciclovir, a nucleoside analogue (5 mg kg 21 i.v. for 2-4 weeks) is usually used for immunocompromised patients with life-threatening end-organ disease. I.V. foscarnet, a phosphonic acid derivative which inhibits viral DNA polymerases, can also be used for ganciclovir-resistant CMV.",
