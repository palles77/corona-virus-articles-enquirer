This article investigates how Korea has to improve emergency managers' disciplinary approach to ultimately contribute to the goal of effective transnational disaster management. This study uses qualitative content analysis of government policies, college curricula, nongovernmental organizations' (NGOs') emergencymanager certification, and mass media coverage to compare emergency managers' unidisciplinary and multidisciplinary approaches. The key tenet is that Korea must change its emergency managers' unidisciplinary approach into a multidisciplinary approach because the former is less effective when dealing with complicated disaster management systems. To achieve this change, the stakeholders must carry out their assigned responsibilities under risk-oriented management. As for the study's international implications, developing nations may consider the enhancement of related educational curricula, collaborative learning, continuous evaluation, disaster awareness, and disaster prevention for the emergency managers' multidisciplinary approach.",

To resolve this, a more collaborative, integrated, and comprehensive form of emergency management is required.",

Also, government institutions at the central government level (being similar to the U.S. federal level) have started to recruit emergency managers as public employees. However, governments have maintained that the capability or knowledge of Korean emergency managers is still limited when it comes to dealing with diverse disasters, both natural disasters and manmade emergencies (Kim, 2014) . To be professional Korean emergency managers, they have to be oriented towards multiple disciplines. Such professionals possess specialized training, skill, or education, whereas non-professionals do not. Restrictively speaking, professional emergency managers concentrate on their own areas of responsibility, but they clearly need multiple disciplines apart from their own specialization.",

Note also that similar terms have been used in place of multidisciplinary, such as interdisciplinary, intradisciplinary, crossdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary. Among them, interdisciplinary has been used frequently or interchangeably with multidisciplinary. What they all have in common is the need for more than one discipline and the interconnection of one discipline to another.",

After rescuing only 172 out of 476 passengers, the public became angry at the poor disaster management actions of the maritime policemen, causing the President to dismantle the institution, which is the NEMA (Hong, 2016) .

To elaborate, disaster plan(s) include handling diverse kinds of disaster. While dealing with them, multidisciplinary disaster plan(s) or related emergency managers communicate with one another and then implement a series of evaluation processes on uncoordinated problems. Their decisions are credible and thus, may flexibly adapt to the complexity of disasters. In short, multidisciplinary emergency managers are able to produce successful outcomes as initially intended during disaster management planning.",
