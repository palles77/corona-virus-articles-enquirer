Examples of viruses causing systemic disease transmitted through the respiratory route include measles and erythrovirus B19. Other human viral infections cause respiratory system disease and transmit through respiratory secretions; for example, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinoviruses and human adapted strains of influenza A, which cause seasonal epidemics, and influenza B and C, which are human pathogens. The outcome of infection and clinical disease presentation is partly dependent on virus factors, which restrict viral replication to certain cell types (tissue tropism).",

Until the 1990s, classic swine influenza A (H1N1), the most commonly circulating swine influenza virus among pigs, remained fairly constant. However, by the late 1990s, different subtypes (H1N1, H3N2, and H1N2) had emerged and became predominant among North American pig herds. These swine influenza A viruses acquired avian, human and swine virus gene segments through reassortment, and various genetic lineages can be distinguished within each subtype. In Europe, swine influenza is caused primarily by the same subtypes. However, the antigenic and genetic characteristics differ significantly from those found in North America and Asia. Genetic diversity has been expanded through multiple introductions of influenza viruses from other animal hosts into pig herds including from humans, most recently demonstrated with H1N1 pdm 2009 virus in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. 2 Recent events confirm the important role of swine in the emergence of novel influenza viruses capable of causing a human pandemic, with the emergence of H1N1 pdm 2009 from a swine reservoir in North America. This H1N1 was sufficiently different from seasonal H1N1 previously circulating since 1977 to show sustained transmission in humans and eventually to replace the previously circulating H1N1 variant. Since 2009, other variant influenza H1N1 and H3N2 viruses circulating in the swine population of North America have also emerged to cause sporadic infections. 8",

Often the presentation may be that of a viral pneumonia, without the prominent features of cough and upper respiratory tract syndromes with rapid progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Following zoonotic transmission of non-human subtypes of influenza A to humans, viral receptors and replication competence will affect the tropism of the virus, and the tissues and body fluids in which the virus may be detected, as has been demonstrated for H5N1 and H7 viruses. In this situation, a broad range of tissues may yield infectious virus recovery and a different spectrum of illness, in contrast to seasonal influenza virus infection. This would include evidence of leucopenia at presentation, which is not a typical feature of seasonal influenza.

Coronaviruses show great adaptability in host range, and as a result can establish and sustain, in a wide range of species, infections that may then spillover into man. This was seen in 2003 with SARS being transmitted from civet cats, which were a permissive secondary host.",

These are in addition to known human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E, which have been recognized as a source of milder respiratory infections in humans for several decades. As a result of SARS, much greater attention has been given to this group of viruses generally, with the result that many new viruses in animals have also been identified. Coronaviruses group genetically into four major groups, with human viruses found in three of the four major groups, although the greatest diversity of coronaviruses is found in bats. 13 ",

All cases so far have a link to the Arabian peninsula. The virus has a zoonotic origin, probably from an animal species indigenous to this region. Cases occur in a sporadic pattern, with human-tohuman transmission in small family or healthcare clusters. 16e18 Risk factors for MERS-CoV include: contact with known case travel to the Arabian peninsula. Exposures or behaviours giving rise to this infection are currently unknown. Once the condition has been diagnosed, supportive care and lung protective ventilation are required, if the case requires hospitalization, with strict attention to infection control.
