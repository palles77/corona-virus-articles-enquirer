Many years of study have shown that live, attenuated pathogens are often more effective at delivering heterologous protein or DNA to induce protective immune responses. However, these vaccine carriers have inherent safety concerns that have limited their development and their use in many patient populations. Studies using nonliving delivery mechanisms have shown that providing both protein antigen and DNA encoding the antigen to an individual induces an improved, more protective immune response but rarely, if ever, are both delivered simultaneously. Here, non-replicating bacterial minicells derived from a commensal E. coli strain are shown to effectively induce antigen-specific immune responses after simultaneous protein and DNA delivery. These data demonstrate the potential use of achromosomal bacterial minicells as a vaccine carrier.",

The recent use of Bacillus anthracis (anthrax) as an agent of bioterrorism in the United States has also helped in accelerating the national interest in vaccine development [1, 2] . While the discovery of protective antigens remains a critical tool in vaccine develop-ment, research efforts on the design and testing of different delivery mechanisms, vaccine formulations, and overall efficacy are also needed. In studying these aspects of vaccine development, it has become increasingly clear that, while the induction of humoral immunity via parenteral administration is in some cases sufficient for protection, the best route of vaccine administration is via mucosal surfaces, especially for protection against organisms that use these surfaces as sites of entry. Efficient delivery is a concern with this approach; however, studies utilizing genetically engineered attenuated pathogenic bacteria or viruses as vaccine carriers have shown promise in a multitude of different infection and tumor models [3] [4] [5] . Although these carriers have demonstrated efficacy in animal models, administration to humans has been limited because of safety concerns ranging from the generation of adverse inflammatory responses, the threat of reversion to a pathogenic state as a result of horizontal gene transfer, and in causing cancer as has been demonstrated in the case of viral vectors [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] .",

Bacterial minicells are small, non-dividing, achromosomal (100-400 nm) vesicles that are produced by most bacterial species as a result of premature septation. Studies focusing on the properties of E. coli minicells have shown that minicells can be engineered to package plasmid DNA, recombinant proteins, or both [11] [12] [13] . On a biochemical level, minicells have been shown to be metabolically active in that they can actively transport metabolites, transcribe and translate plasmid encoded gene products, and are subject to infection by bacteriophage [14] [15] [16] [17] . In addition, minicells contain the same structural protein and lipid constituents of parental cells including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), and an intact peptidoglycan layer. These surface components are quickly recognized by antigen presenting cells (APC) as pathogen associated molecular patterns through Toll-like and other receptors expressed by these cells [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . The interaction between LPS and TLR4, in particular, helps to stimulate the inflammatory response necessary to generate an immune response as well as promoting the uptake and processing of bacteria [23] . Minicells retain these abilities of parental bacterial cells.",

Using green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a general antigen and monitoring antibody production in the sera as well as the mucosa, the best minicell formulation tested contained both recombinantly expressed antigen as well as plasmid DNA encoding the antigen under eukaryotic control. This delivery combination was able to induce high levels of IgG in the sera after introduction by several different routes, including intramuscular (i.m.), intranasal (i.n.), and oral (p.o.) administration.

To this end, MPX1B9 cells harboring the plasmid pRHA-67::GFP were induced to produce GFP simultaneous with minicell production. Fig. 1a shows that minicells purified as described in Section 2 were found to contain detectable levels of GFP protein using confocal microscopy. The quantification of GFP protein was performed using a series of Western blots (not shown) derived from each minicell preparation in conjunction with densitometry and the results shown in Fig. 1a . To demonstrate that minicells could also encapsulate plasmid DNA, plasmid DNA was isolated from 10 10 minicells derived from MPX1B9 harboring either the pRHA-67, pRHA-67::GFP, pMJG3, or pGFPVAX plasmids. The amount of recovered plasmid DNA was quantitated using A 260 readings. A summary of the formulation results for each plasmid is also shown in Fig. 1a . These data show that minicells can either encapsulate plasmid DNA alone or in combination with expressed recombinant protein. Prior to any immunization, it was important to reduce the number of viable parent cells remaining in the minicell preparation. To this end, minicell-producing cultures were treated with 1 g/mL ciproflaxin prior to the isolation of minicells. It was determined that the number of viable contaminating parent cells was reduced from 6.0 \u00d7 10 4 /10 10 minicells to \u223c150/10 10 minicells when cultures were treated with ciproflaxin for 2 h.",

Minicells harboring plasmid DNA (pRHA-67) were stained with SYBR Gold and their uptake was followed at various time points. As shown in Fig. 1b , substantial numbers of minicells were taken up by J774A.1 cells at 90 min.

As an additional control, identical experiments were performed with HeLa and Cos-7 cells. HeLa and Cos-7 cells are non-phagocytic under normal conditions. As a result, no minicell uptake was seen at any time point observed in these cell lines (data not shown).

To test for antigen-specific immune responses to GFP, mice were immunized three times each via the i.m. route with several different minicell formulations. The minicells used included those encapsulating either GFP protein alone, eukaryotic expression plasmid DNA alone, the combination of GFP protein and plasmid DNA in the same minicell, or empty vector controls. As a comparison, naked plasmid DNA (pMJG3) was administered in amounts equivalent to that encapsulated in 10 10 minicells (\u223c3 g DNA) on the same immunization schedule. As seen in Fig. 2a , there was a \u223c12-fold increase in antibody titers from mice immunized with minicells containing both heterologous GFP protein antigen and plasmids encoding the mammalian expression cassette driving GFP expression (MC DNA/Protein). This increase was over serum titers of GFP-specific IgG from mice immunized with naked plasmid DNA alone, minicells containing GFP protein antigen alone, or minicells containing plasmid DNA vaccine alone. These results indicate that much higher antibody responses were achieved when recombinantly expressed protein antigen and eukaryotic expression plasmid DNA were delivered together by the minicell vehicle.

There are several potential advantages of using minicells derived from commensal E. coli strains of bacteria in fitting this unmet need. Minicells derived from commensal bacteria are likely to be better tolerated than heat-killed vaccines derived from pathogenic bacteria, potentially reducing adverse inflammatory immune responses. Beyond these and other safety advantages, another potential advantage stems from the versatile nature of the minicell carrier for implementation of different \"prime-boost\" strategies using different vaccine modalities. The sequential delivery of genetic vaccines and protein antigens has been shown to be more effective in inducing humoral responses in humans than genetic vaccines alone [33] [34] [35] [36] and can be well facilitated by the minicell delivery system. This strategy has proven effective using poliovirus replicons, attenuated Salmonella enterica sv Typhi Ty21a, and in several other genetic immunization protocols [33, 34, [36] [37] [38] . In all cases, the immune system was primed with the genetic vaccine and then boosted with the corresponding recombinant antigen.",

As such, minicells derived from these strains have the ability to survive the hostile environment of the gastrointestinal tract, making them an attractive candidate for mucosal delivery. On the other hand, using minicells derived from commensal bacteria may be disadvantageous because pre-existing natural mucosal tolerance has been built to the minicell vector as a result of the exposure of the immune system to commensal bacterial antigens. As with any vaccine platform, the adjuvant properties of the vehicle may be important in generating an immune response and enhanced immunogenecity, i.e. \"foreignness\", may be required for efficient vaccine delivery. However, the immunogenicity of the vehicle may also prevent subsequent use of the same vehicle to deliver a different vaccine if memory responses to the vehicle have been raised in the first immunization, as has been shown in cases where Salmonella sp. have been used as carriers [39, 40] . More testing will be required to fully evaluate the ability of commensal E. coli minicells to effectively deliver antigens and DNA using mucosal routes of administration. At the same time, mucosal immunity is not understood nearly as well as humoral immunity especially with respect to the development of immunological memory [41] [42] [43] . As more information becomes available on the mechanisms and requirements for the establishment of immunological memory in the mucosa, the improvements needed to enhance efficacy of minicells as vaccine carriers will be better understood.",

            "text": "While the data shown here directly demonstrate that minicells can induce immune responses after delivery of both heterologous protein antigen and the DNA encoding that antigen, many questions remain. For example, the studies shown here strongly suggest that multiple immunizations are superior when minicells deliver both DNA and protein. This may be because the DNA component primes the animal to respond to subsequent exposure to protein and vice versa. On the other hand, a single dose administration of naked DNA alone or of minicells containing only plasmid DNA gave higher specific antibody titers compared to those of mice immunized three times (see Fig. 2b ). It is possible that this is due to the timing of the testing (21 days for single administration versus 35 days for 3 immunizations), but further experimentation is required to determine if this is the case. Either way, these results suggest that a boost is not necessarily effective in increasing antigen specific serum IgG levels when naked DNA or minicells encapsulating DNA are used. This may be due to the effects of vector priming as has been shown for certain Salmonella serovars used to deliver vaccines [39] . In those studies, it was shown that a previous exposure to the relevant Salmonella carrier resulted in dramatic decreases in immune responses to antigens delivered at a later time by the same carrier. The results shown in Fig. 2 also suggest that using minicells to deliver only soluble protein antigens is largely ineffective. This may be because soluble GFP protein is only mildly immunogenic and is located on the interior of minicells. Exchanging GFP for a more immunogenic cytosolic antigen like LT-B or expressing protein antigens on the surface of minicells may help in increasing antibody titers [44] . Future studies utilizing a more biologically relevant antigen are required to elucidate the mechanisms behind these results in addition to determining the ability to protect as well as the longevity and isotype profiles of any antibody responses.",

MPX1B9 cells containing pRHA-67::GFP were co-induced to express soluble GFP while producing minicells. The budding and purification process was followed by visualizing GFPcontaining minicells. The top left panel shows MPX1B9 cells that express GFP in the absence of inducing minicell formation. The bottom left panel shows the same culture three generations after inducing minicell production. The inlay demonstrates a budding event from the polar region of the parent cell. Purified minicells containing soluble GFP are in the bottom right panel. The table summarizes the results of minicell vaccine formulation testing. The amounts of protein antigen and plasmid DNA contained within the indicated minicell vaccines are shown. Results are from three independent experiments using 10 10 minicells per experiment. (b) SYBR gold stained minicells were incubated with J774A.1 for various times. The lower panel shows J774A.1 cells incubated with SYBR gold stained minicells for 90 min. The addition of minicells containing no plasmid DNA was used as a negative control (top). (c) BMDDC were analyzed for GFP expression 48 h after incubating with minicells harboring the expression plasmid. The bottom panel shows BMDDC expressing the GFP transgene delivered by minicells at an M.O.I. of 10,000. APC incubated with minicells containing empty vector plasmid pRHA-67 serve as the negative control (top).",
