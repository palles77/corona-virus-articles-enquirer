            "text": "Modern recombinant vector vaccines combine the advantages of an attenuated or even host-restricted infection with a highly immunogenic expression of an antigen of choice. Especially promising vectors are highly attenuated poxviruses, including modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) [1] . MVA has been attenuated by repeated passaging in chicken fibroblast cultures [2] , and its properties as potential human vector vaccine have been well characterized [1, [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Various MVA recombinants that express different viral heterologous antigens have been generated and extensively tested in pre-clinical and clinical trials as candidate vaccine against diseases such as AIDS, influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection [7, [9] [10] [11] . The use of MVA as a vector-based vaccine, however, is predicted to require highly concentrated doses of about 10 8 infectious units (IU) per mL [1, 6] , preferably produced in media free of animal-derived components. MVA (similar to other viruses such as influenza A virus or yellow fever virus) is being produced in material obtained from embryonated chicken eggs or primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) [8] . However, the use of primary animal-derived material that is continuously fed into vaccine production processes is not an optimal scenario. To overcome this problem, two fully permissive avian suspension cell lines, AGE1.CR (in the following CR) and AGE1.CR.pIX (in the following CR.pIX) were developed [12] and adapted to proliferation in a chemically defined medium to enable the establishment of robust high-yield production processes [13] [14] [15] . Because MVA spreads preferably via cell-to-cell contact a culture format was developed where cell agglomerates of infected and non-infected cells are being induced for production of vaccine preparations. A MVA strain (MVA-CR19) was recently obtained with this system that propagates also in nonagglomerated CR.pIX suspension cells [16] . With this new isolate that represents a different genotype of MVA, titers in the order of 10 8 IU/mL can be obtained at conventional-cell-densities (CCD) of about 2.0 \u00c2 10 6 cells/mL. As a higher fraction of MVA-CR19 is released into the supernatant, harvest of infectious units does not require whole-cell lysates anymore, facilitating the subsequent downstream processing [16] .",

While virus propagation in HCD often results either in a decrease in cell-specific yields [18, 19] the so-called ''cell-density effect\" [20, 21] -or in low volumetric productivity [22] , there are reports on positive effects on virus titers and cell-specific yields if certain medium feeding/exchange strategies prior to or during virus propagation are being applied. The described strategies can involve medium recirculation, medium perfusion, and periodic virus harvesting [17] . However, in most of these approaches adherent cell lines were used with limited options for scale-up and process intensification.

Without medium exchange at TOI, a maximum virus titer of 1.0 \u00c2 10 8 virions/mL was obtained at 35 hpi (Fig. 4B) , despite the subsequent addition of a 10-fold glucose-concentrated CD-U3 medium (0, 22 and 50 hpi) in fedbatch (FB) to avoid energy depletion. This led to a very low cellspecific yield of 2.3 virions/cell and a volumetric productivity of 2.4 \u00c2 10 8 virions/(L d) ( Table 2) , which was about one log lower compared to the HCD cultivation in the bioreactor (Table 1) . Compared to infections at CCD, the difference was even larger (Table 1) . However, MVA-CR19 production considerably improved with a single 50% medium exchange at TOI followed by the addition of concentrated medium only at 21 hpi, when glucose was depleted. Despite a short-term glucose limitation, no negative effect in later virus propagation was observed and maximum virus titers of 3.2 \u00c2 10 9 virions/mL were obtained at about 72 hpi in both the lysate and the supernatant (Fig. 4D ). This demonstrated that 100% of the produced viruses can be harvested from supernatant at 72 hpi with no need of a cell-disrupting operation (e.g. freeze/thaw), as observed previously in CCD infections. With a cell-specific yield of 62 virions/cell and a volumetric productivity of 6.0 \u00c2 10 10 virions/(L d) (Table 2) , the results achieved are in the same range as for the HCD perfusion culture performed in the bioreactor (Table 1) . This suggested that the medium exchange at TOI rather than the exclusive glucose supply in FB with concentrated medium is required to boost MVA-CR19 virus propagation (especially from 0 to 24 hpi, Fig. 4B and D) . Also, it has been reported that glutamine plays a minor role in energy supply for CR.pIX cells and that its absence might not influence the propagation of MVA in this cell line [29] . Therefore, the positive effect of a medium exchange at TOI on virus propagation might be also due to the dilution of inhibitory metabolites or signaling molecules rather than just a better supply of substrates.",

Interestingly, the increase in volume for FB (Fig. 5D ) and F+D (Fig. 5F ) during the first 24 hpi did not result in a noticeable reduction of virus titers compared to the DME strategy (Fig. 5E ). This positive effect of volume changes on virus titers, despite their expected reduction due to product dilution, was also documented previously for the volume-expanded fed-batch strategy [33] . At 36 hpi, the DME strategy showed a slight decrease in virus accumulation compared to both other strategies. This is possibly due to the removal of infectious particles (harvest of 90% supernatant) and a glucose limitation at 24 hpi. This contrasted with the FB and F+D strategies, where titers above 1.0 \u00c2 10 9 virions/mL were reached at 36 hpi. Nevertheless, a daily exchange of medium (DME, F+D strategy) extended the virus production phase, and allowed to achieve virus titers up to 1.0 \u00c2 10 10 virions/mL at 72 hpi. In contrast, the maximum titer was only 3.7 \u00c2 10 9 virions/mL for the FB at the same time point (Fig. 5G-I) . Product harvests (supernatant) obtained for the DME and F+D strategies showed consistently very similar virus titers to the lysates (except for harvests at 36 hpi in F+D) and even same titers at 72 hpi. Titers in this range were also obtained by Jordan et al. [16] . Accordingly, MVA-CR19 propagation in the CR.pIX cells does not require any disruption steps of the host cells to achieve very high product titers in HCD cultivations.",

Furthermore, the maximum Y v/cell app of the F+D strategy exceeds the yield of both other approaches by a factor of two or three. Regarding the P V , the difference between the feeding strategies is smaller. As expected, the difference becomes less evident for the overall cell-specific yield (Table 3) , which takes into account cells produced even after TOI. However, FB-based strategies (FB and F+D) showed up to two times higher maximum cell-specific yields compared to DME (Table 3) , which indicates an optimal balance between the maintenance of healthy cells and the progress of virus replication. This observation is also supported by the higher percentage of infected cells obtained for the FB and F+D strategies (Fig. 5G-I) .

This way, medium utilization until TOI was considered 60% lower for FB and F+D strategies (V w = 20 mL) compared to the DME (V w = 50 mL). Accordingly, the F+D strategy provided the best volumetric productivity, since it provided the lowest medium consumption during the cell expansion phase and produced the highest amount of virus particles (Table 3) . Overall, the F+D strategy optimally combined a low medium consumption with high yields. Another positive feature of substrate feeding in a fed-batch mode is that no virus is lost at early stages of infection, which helps to reach a higher fraction of infected cells and high titers at about 36 hpi (Fig. 5G -I) without reaching limiting glucose concentrations. At that time point, a first harvest should also be considered to collect a highly concentrated supernatant and to avoid the accumulation by-products with a negative impact on virus replication (compare time course of virus titers in Fig. 5G and I) . Furthermore, a transfer of the cell suspension to a new vessel was not required for the F+D strategy, which represents an advantage against the FB and the reported VEF-batch [33] regarding the operation of large bioreactors.",

This was also observed regarding the slight increase in cell-specific yields. Even more significant was the considerable increase in volumetric productivity of up to four times in the case of the F+D strategy (Table 3) . For an implementation of both the DME and the F+D strategies in large-scale vaccine manufacturing, several limitations have to taken into account. For example, at production scale medium exchanges and product harvests cannot be done as fast as in scale-down systems. Accordingly, the use of ATF or other hollow fiber systems with an adequate membrane cut-off should be considered. Based on the results obtained here, adaptation and optimization of such culture formats should focus not only on an adequate substrate supply of cells immediately before and after infection but also on an optimal dilution of possible inhibitors of infection and appropriate virus harvest intervals.",

Future scale-up studies may achieve an increased cell proliferation if parameters of shake flask cultivation are approximated in bioreactors. Such parameters may include an unregulated pH profile during the batch cultivation phase, in which pH decreases as lactate accumulates, and the indirect pH regulation with the exchange of medium during the perfusion phase. Dissolved oxygen and/or stirring speed may also have been underestimated and perhaps should be adjusted to avoid DO gradients.",

A partial medium replacement may dilute inhibitory metabolites and replenish nutrients that have been depleted during the cell proliferation phase. One process design that takes these observations into account employs a complete medium exchange, followed by fed-batch intervals. Such a strategy is a good option especially for viruses with replication cycles that are longer than the time needed to deplete the available glucose given in the initial medium exchange. Once this first critical stage is overcome, a (semi-) continuous medium exchange could be applied to collect infectious virus material and to avoid the accumulation of toxic by-products. A combination of all options allowed to increase the cell-specific virus yields compared to CCD cultivations and to achieve a very high volumetric productivity at HCD.",

Using existing bioreactors coupled to perfusion systems, HCD cultivations have the potential to outperform conventional production strategies, when implementing additional optimizations focusing on the challenges for scale-up discussed above. Consequently, the here studied culture formats may also allow (semi-)continuous cell-free virus harvesting and thus simplify the subsequent downstream processing. ",
