The actions and cell communication via cytokines in the CNS are designated as the CNS cytokine network, in which microglia and astrocytes play the central roles. To further characterize the CNS cytokine network we investigated the differences in roles of these cells, and found that microglia might contribute to the early phase of cytokine production reaction and that astrocytes might contribute the late phase of the reaction. We also investigated roles of inhibitory cytokines such as TGF 13, IL-4, and IL-10, and showed that each might play a distinct role in the inhibitory regulation in the CNS. We summarized our previous report about cellular distribution of cytokine receptors in the CNS cells and discussed their roles in the CNS cytokine network. Finally, we investigated that expression of IL-6 and IL-2 receptors in neuronal and oligodendrocytic differentiation, respectively. From these results, we discussed the features of the CNS cytokine network.",

These factors were initially considered to act on target cells in a cell-type and stage-specific manner. However, it has been shown that their biological actions are pleiotropic, complementary and counteractive; each of them exerts multiple effects on different cells, and different factors can act on the same cell populations to induce similar or opposite effects. Moreover, production of several cytokines is controlled by other cytokines in stimulatory or inhibitory manners and, in some cases, acts as a cascade. Therefore, these complex cytokine actions are referred to as a cytokine network.",

            "text": "Recent evidence suggests that bi-directional communication occurs between cells of the nervous and immune systems. The basis for this communication is the release of cytokines by immunocomponent cells, as well as hormone products of the neuroendocrine system. Cells resident within the central nervous system (CNS) can synthesize, secrete and respond to inflammatory cytokines not only contributing to the responses to injury or immunological challenge within the CNS, but also regulating their own growth and differentiation potential. There are many similarities of cytokine actions between the immune system and the CNS. However, there are also several unique modes of cytokine action in the CNS 26,29,37 (i.e. their target cells, inducing functions on the target cells such as other cytokine production, MHC antigens induction and cell growth control and inducing agents of their production). Therefore, the actions and communication of cytokines in the CNS are designated as the CNS cytokine network. 24 Microglia, macrophage-like cells in the CNS, are one of the most important cells in the CNS cytokine network. They produce interleukin (IL)-I, 7 IL-5, 26 IL-6, 5,29 tumor necrosis factor-~ (TNF-a) 25 and transforming growth factor-J3 (TGF-13). 45 They also respond to several cytokines such as colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), 20 colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and IL-3. 31.38 GM-CSF and M-CSF are produced by astrocytes in the CNS, 18,20,43 and, therefore,  astrocytes may play a role in controlling microglial growth and functions. Astrocytes are another  cell population important in the CNS cytokine network and produce a variety of cytokines such as  IL-1, 7 IL-5, 26 IL-6, 5,29 CSFs, 18.2\u00b0,43 TGF-1345 and TNF-e~. 25 There are many similar aspects of cytokine production and responses between microglia and astrocytes, however, the roles in the CNS cytokine network may be different in these cells; microglia may play an important role in the removal of dead cells or their remnants by phagocytosis in brain injury while astrocytes provide structural and environmental support for neurons. There are no clear indications of the difference between the roles of microglia and astrocytes in the cytokine production and response.",

During this process, IL-6 receptor mRNA was expressed and increased in a time-dependent manner (Fig.   4B ). As shown in Table 2 , purified oligodendrocytes expressed the IL-2 receptor. Therefore, we investigated changes in IL-2 receptor mRNA expression during ollgodendrocytic differentiation in OS3. In the presence of 10% serum, very low levels of IL-2 receptor mRNA were detected and these increased gradually after serum was decreased to 2% (Fig. 5) .",

In this paper, we examined the time-course of TNF-e~ production in microglia and astrocytes under continuous stimulation by LPS and found the differences between microglia and astrocytes in TNF-a production (Fig. 1) . The results suggested that astrocytes were desensitized under continuous stimulation with LPS, and the signal in astrocytes to induce TNF-a expression and production was turned off, while that in microglia was not and they responded to LPS continuously. The slower onset of cytokine production in astrocytes than in microglia was observed in the onset of IL-6 production (Fig. 2) . Thus, IL-6 production by astrocytes and microglia appear to be regulated by different intracellular mechanisms or different promoter/enhancer elements of the IL-6 gene, the existence of which has been reported previously. 32,42,46 Furthermore, different regulatory mechanisms were involved in IL-6 expression in response to LPS and TNF-a even in the same cell, because the onset of IL-6 production in astrocytes was different between LPS-and TNF-a stimulations (Fig. 2) . This speculation is consistent with the previous suggestion that different nuclear factors and enhancer elements induce IL-6 gene expression in response to LPS and TNF-c~.",

Therefore, we investigated mRNA expression of cytokine receptors and showed changes in expression of IL-6 and IL-2 receptors during neuronal and oligodendrocytic differentiation, respectively. During N18 cell differentiation by dbcAMP, IL-6 receptor mRNA was expressed and increased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4B) .

As shown in Table 2 , purified oligodendrocytes expressed the IL-2 receptor. IL-2 has been reported to act as a mitogen on immature oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, 2 to stop the proliferation of mature oligodendrocyte progenitors 22 and to induce differentiation of oligodendrocytes to mature myelin basic protein-positive forms. 2 This suggests the possibility that the IL-2 receptor may involve oligodendrocyte differentiation.",

Therefore, the control of microglial growth by T-cell factors are one of important methods of regulation of CNS cells by peripheral immune cells. In addition to this, cytokines produced in the CNS can control immune cell functions. For example, microglia and astrocytes can produce IL-5 but none of the CNS cells express its receptor. Therefore, it is possible that CNS-derived IL-5 may control immune cells within and/or out of the CNS. These communications may be important for brain-immune interactions and some aspects may play crucial roles in certain pathological conditions such as AIDS-dementia complex and multiple sclerosis. 28 ",

Microglia expressed mRNA for receptors of IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, GM-CSF and M-CSF. Astrocytes were positive for receptors of IL-6, IL-7, GM-CSF and M-CSF. Oligodendrocytes were positive for receptors of IL-3, IL-4, IL-7, GM-CSF and M-CSF. Neuronal cells expressed receptors of IL-6 and GM-CSF with very low levels. IL-3, GM-CSF and M-CSF are growth factors for monocyte lineage cells including microglia. 38 These cytokines induce microglia to proliferate, activate their biological activity and change their shape. 31,35 We demonstrated that microglia expressed mRNAs encoding IL-3, GM-CSF and M-CSF receptors at relatively high levels as compared to those in other cells",
