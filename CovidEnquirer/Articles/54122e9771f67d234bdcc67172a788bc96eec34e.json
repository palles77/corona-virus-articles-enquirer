For these 159 experiments we monitored the transcript levels of I\u03baB\u03b1, an NF-\u03baB target gene. Because 160 the I\u03baB\u03b1 protein inhibits NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation, its expression serves as a 161 feedback inhibitor of NF-\u03baB activity (20) . Consistent with our RNA-seq data, we found 162 that reovirus inhibits I\u03baB\u03b1 expression to a significant extent following treatment with 163 either agonist (Fig. 3A, 3B ). Because the effect of reovirus on both NF-\u03baB agonists was 164 equivalent, we used TNF\u03b1 for the remainder of our experiments. TNF\u03b1 treatment of 165 cells should promote nuclear translocation of p65. We measured nuclear p65 levels in 166 mock-infected and reovirus-infected cells treated with TNF\u03b1. As expected, TNF\u03b1 167 treatment of mock infected cells resulted in an accumulation of p65 in the nucleus within 168 1 h (Fig. 3C ). Prior infection with T3A prevented TNF\u03b1 driven accumulation of p65 in the 169 nucleus. These data agree with previous evidence indicating that degradation of the 170 I\u03baB\u03b1 protein is blocked in reovirus infected cells (21). I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation is initiated by the 171 phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 by the I\u03baB Kinase (IKK) complex, which leads to 172 .

In this study, we sought to evaluate if reovirus infection alters the cellular response to 225 pathogen invasion. Using RNA-seq, which allowed us to examine changes in the global 226 transcriptional landscape, we found that target genes of IRF were induced to a similar 227 extent in cells infected with reovirus and cells transfected with vgRNA. NF-\u03baB target 228 genes, however, were expressed to a much lower extent in infected cells in comparison 229 to cells transfected with vgRNA. Moreover, exogenous NF-\u03baB agonists failed to induce 230 a NF-\u03baB dependent gene expression program in infected cells. These data indicate that 231 NF-\u03baB activity is blocked in infected cells. We found that this blockade of NF-\u03baB 232 dependent gene expression is caused by a loss of IKK\u03b2 and NEMO, two critical 233 components of the IKK complex. We propose that reovirus inhibits NF-\u03baB to counter its 234 antiviral effects and produce a cellular environment that is conducive for replication. 235",

To define 207whether blockade of NF-\u03baB by T3A also occurred in other cell lines, we measured the 208 capacity of T3A to influence TNF\u03b1 induced expression of I\u03baB\u03b1 in HEK293 cells using 209 RT-qPCR. Analogous to our observation in L929 cells, TNF\u03b1 failed to induce I\u03baB\u03b1 gene 210 expression in T3A infected HEK293 cells(Fig. 6A). Phosphorylation of p65 at Ser536 211 (Fig. 6B) and its nuclear translocation following TNF\u03b1 treatment were also inhibited(Fig. 212 6C). Additionally, we noted a decrease in IKK\u03b2 levels in comparison to mock infected 213 cells(Fig. 6B). To determine if ectopic overexpression of the IKK complex restores NF-214 \u03baB signaling in reovirus infected cells, we transfected cells with constructs expressing 215 tagged forms of IKK\u03b2 and NEMO. Overexpression of these constructs was sufficient to 216 induce NF-\u03baB signaling in mock infected cells, as marked by p65 Ser536 217 phosphorylation(Fig. 6D).

Thus, in reovirus infected cells, p65 nuclear 182 translocation and phosphorylation, both of which require the IKK complex, are inhibited. 183These data suggest that reovirus may inhibit NF-\u03baB dependent gene expression due to 184 the inactivity of the IKK complex. 185Levels of IKKb and NEMO are diminished following reovirus infection.To 186 determine the basis of IKK inactivity following infection with T3A, we examined the 187 levels of IKK\u03b2 and NEMO, key IKK components that are required for NF-\u03baB activation 188 following TNF\u03b1 treatment. We found that levels of IKK\u03b2 and NEMO are dramatically 189 lower at 12 and 24 h following infection with T3A(Fig. 4A, 4B). In contrast, levels of an 190 upstream signaling protein, RIP1, was unaffected by T3A infection. Similarly, levels of 191 NF-\u03baB constituents p50 and p65 also remained constant. These data indicate that T3A-192 mediated diminishment in levels of IKK\u03b2 and NEMO likely contributes to a reduction in 193 IKK activity and resultant blockade of NF-\u03baB in infected cells. Because IKK\u03b2 is the 194 catalytic component of the IKK complex that is required for I\u03baB\u03b1 and p65 Ser536 195 phosphorylation, we used IKK\u03b2 levels as a surrogate to monitor the mechanism by 196 which IKK activity is diminished following infection. 197 Reovirus gene expression is required for the loss of IKKb.

While canonical NF-\u03baB signaling requires IKK\u03b2 and NEMO, reovirus 238 induced NF-\u03baB activation requires an unusual combination of IKK\u03b1 and NEMO (24). 239 Reovirus-induced activation of NF-\u03baB occurs early following infection. Recent studies 240 demonstrating a requirement for mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) for NF-241 \u03baB activation indicate that vgRNA initiates this response (17). While other work 242 suggests roles for reovirus \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 proteins in activating NF-\u03baB, it is unclear if this 243 effect is through controlling the exposure of vgRNA or via another mechanism (25-27). 244 Regardless, NF-\u03baB activation early in infection does not require viral gene expression. 245In contrast, our studies presented here indicate that viral gene expression is required for 246",

Thus, our work is in contrast to 271 a previous study which suggested that TRIM29 in alveolar macrophages turns over 272 NEMO via lysosomal degradation (36). Blockade of proteasome activity diminished 273 reovirus infection, precluding us from evaluating the role of the proteasome in IKK\u03b2 loss 274 following infection (not shown). Thus reovirus infection leads to IKK loss through a post-275 translational mechanism, likely degradation via a non-lysosomal pathway. 276 What is the physiologic relevance of blockade of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by 277 reovirus? A likely reason is because NF-\u03baB can limit virus replication. Which NF-\u03baB 278 target(s) control virus infection has not been identified. An obvious NF-\u03baB target that 279 could inhibit reovirus infection is IFN. However, consistent with previous work 280",
