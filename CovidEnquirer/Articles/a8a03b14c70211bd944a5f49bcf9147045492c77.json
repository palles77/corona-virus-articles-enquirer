This study was aimed to determine whether hyposialylated fAGP influences phagocytosis. A flow cytometric method based on ingestion of fluoresceinated bacteria and adapted to feline blood was used to assess phagocytosis of leukocytes incubated with 'non-pathological' fAGP (purified from sera with normal concentrations of AGP) and 'pathological' fAGP (purified from sera with >1.5 mg/mL hyposialylated AGP). The flow cytometric method provided repeatable results for neutrophils (coefficients of variations, CVs <15%) but not for monocytes (CVs > 20%) which had also a high individual variability. Compared with saline solution and with non-pathological fAGP, pathological fAGP significantly decreased phagocytosis in neutrophils and monocytes. This study demonstrated that hyposialylated fAGP down-regulates the phagocytic activity of feline neutrophils.",

The development of the disease depends on the immune response of the host (Pedersen, 1987) , as suggested by the different number of lymphocytes and by the different concentration of molecules involved in inflammation or immunity found in cats with FIP compared with FCoV-infected, clinically healthy cats (Kipar et al., 2001; Berg et al., 2005; Gelain et al., 2006; Giordano and Paltrinieri, 2009) .

Aliquots of 100 lL blood were prepared to assess in duplicate either non-activated phagocytosis (basal phagocytic activity of resting cells incubated on ice) or activated phagocytosis (phagocytic activity of cells incubated for 10 min in a water bath at 37\u00b0C followed by rapid blocking of phagocytosis by immersion on ice). Before incubation, each aliquot was mixed with different amounts (see below) of FITC-labelled E. coli. After incubation, a quenching solution (100 lL) was added to inactivate the fluorescence of non-phagocytosed E. coli. Cell suspensions were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 4\u00b0C, centrifuged (5 min, 250g, 4\u00b0C) and mixed with the lysing solution provided in the kit.

These gates were designed during a previous study (Paltrinieri et al., 2012) based on cell distribution assessed using monoclonal antibodies against each leukocyte population. To exclude artifacts due to the residual fluorescence of aggregates of E. coli the intensity of positivity of DNA staining was assessed on histograms of the gated population to differentiate aploid bacteria from diploid nucleated cells. Diploid cells were back-gated to evaluate phagocytosis: two histograms (neutrophils and monocytes) were generated and data were expressed as percentage of phagocytosing cells and as median channel fluorescence (MCF) emitted by the cells. The MCF is proportional to the amount of ingested bacteria per cell. Data were recorded on a logarithmic scale and values of non-activated samples were subtracted from those of activated samples to determine the percentage of phagocytic cells and the MCF of each sample.",

The phagocytic activity of feline neutrophils and monocytes was determined by a flow cytometric protocol that copes with the need to work with low volumes of blood, as frequently occurs in cats, and provides the opportunity to work with whole blood, which paints a more reliable picture of cell-cell interactions that occur in blood. The main limitation of tests performed in whole blood is that other substance in plasma (cytokines, pro-inflammatory molecules, or even endogenous AGP) may interfere with cell responses. The study design adopted in this study, however, minimized the possible influence of endogenous substances since on one side all the cats were clinically healthy and have a normal concentration of AGP, and on the other side an aliquot of whole blood was incubated with saline solution. Therefore, the only difference between this aliquot and activated aliquots was the amount (and, as regards fAGP, the type of sialylation) of activator(s). Therefore, it is very likely that the different responses recorded after incubation with AGP or albumin actually depend on the presence of activators rather than on endogenous molecules.",

The residual positivity on lymphocytes, possibly due to non-specific adherence of bacteria or to the low phagocytic activity of lymphocytes (Tizard, 2009; Parra et al., 2012) did not influence the interpretation of neutrophil and monocyte, since the phagocytic activity of these cells was evaluated on gated cell populations that do not contain lymphocytes (Paltrinieri et al., 2012) . Using the optimized method, intra-assay imprecision was higher in non-activated cells, as expected for datasets with low mean values (Westgard, 2003) , but acceptable in activated cells, with CVs comparable to those reported previously (Hoffmann-Jagielska et al., 2003) . Neutrophils had a higher phagocytic activity than monocytes, since phagocytosis of monocytes must be activated by cytokines (Netea et al., 2008; Tizard, 2009) . Results of monocytes were also biased by the high imprecision and individual variability.",

This finding, coupled with the high AGP concentration in sera from sick animals, which is also consistent with FIP (Duthie et al., 1997) , suggests that, although the clinical diagnosis of FIP was not confirmed post-mortem, it is very likely that most of the pathological sera came from FIP affected cats.",

By consequence, the amount of purified AGP was sufficient only for a limited number of replicas. In spite of this limitation, the pathological and strongly hyposialylated fAGP down-regulated phagocytosis of neutrophils and, to a lesser extent, of monocytes, when added at concentrations similar to those found in FIP. The high variability of monocytes depends on the intrinsic variability of their responses, potentially amplified by the low number of cats tested, rather than on a true effect of AGP. The possible influence of subclinical conditions was also unlikely since the cats were clinically and clinico-pathologically healthy. Fig. 3 . Results obtained after incubation of whole blood with saline solution (Neg), bovine albumin (Alb), non-pathological feline AGP (fAGP-NP), bovine AGP (bAGP) and pathological feline AGP (fAGP-P). The four graphs display the percentage of phagocytosing neutrophils (A), the median channel fluorescence (MCF) of neutrophils (B), the percentage of phagocytosing monocytes (C) and the MCF of monocytes (D). The boxes indicates the I-III interquartile range (IQR), the horizontal line indicates the median values, whiskers extend to further observation within the I quartile minus 1.5 \u2044 IQR or to further observation within the III quartile plus 1.5 \u2044 IQR. Asterisks indicate values that are significantly different from the negative control (saline solution) and the symbols indicate values that are significantly different from non pathological fAGP: as regards neutrophils, both the percentage of the phagocytic cells and the MCF were significantly lower after incubation with pathological fAGP compared with controls and with non pathological fAGP. Conversely, as regards monocytes, the percentage of the phagocytic cells and the MCF were significantly lower after incubation with pathological fAGP compared with controls and with non-pathological fAGP. The incubation with bovine AGP induced a significant decrease of the percentage of the phagocytic cells only compared with controls but not with non-pathological fAGP.",

The results of this study do not allow us to formulate any hypothesis on the mechanism(s) responsible for this finding. Hyposialylation has been found to be specific in FIP, but not in clinically healthy, FCoV infected cats (Ceciliani et al., 2004; Paltrinieri et al., 2008) . Although previous report, performed with methods different from those reported in this study, suggested that phagocytosis is not suppressed in cats wit FIP (Knotek et al., 2000) , the hyposialylation of fAGP, which we found to down-regulate phagocytosis, may influence the clinical outcome of FCoV infection by inducing a failure of cellular responses to the virus. Macrophages and neutrophils are involved in FIP immunopathology, being the most abundant, while hardly effective, populations in pyogranulomatous lesions (Kipar et al., 1998; Paltrinieri et al., 1998) . It would be interesting to investigate whether other cell-mediated functions are hampered by desialylated fAGP. Among these, the potential of AGP of modulate apoptosis through variations in the glycan moiety (Williams et al., 1997; De Vries et al., 2004; Kagaya et al., 2005; could be interesting, since lymphocyte apoptosis occurs in cats with FIP (Takano et al., 2007) , but not in FCoV-infected, clinically healthy cats (Paltrinieri et al., 2003) .",

In Western blots for both lectins (A), each lane was loaded with 2 lg purified protein. Non-pathological protein reacts strongly with both lectins when compared with the pathological protein. The signal recorded with the two lectins in the pathological pool is weak. For each lectin, the reactivity with SNAI and MAAI has been quantified by a densitometry and the quantification of the area under the peaks (B) confirms that for both lectins, the value corresponding to pathological fAGP is lower than that of non pathological fAGP.",
