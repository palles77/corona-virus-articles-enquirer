During the containment and early mitigation phases of the swine-origin influenza virus (S-OIV) A H1N1 pandemic, an infection control bundle consisting of multiple coherent measures was organised by our infection control team to minimise nosocomial transmission. This included repeated open staff forum achieving high attendance; early recognition of index cases among inpatients by liberal testing; early relief of sick staff from work; directly observed hand hygiene practice during outbreaks; and monitoring of compliance with infection control practice. During the first 100 days (from 1 May to 8 August 2009) when the first 100 laboratory-confirmed patients with S-OIV and 12 infected healthcare workers (HCWs) were identified, a total of 836 asymptomatic exposed persons (184 patients and 652 HCWs) were required to undergo a seven-day medical surveillance. The infection control nurses monitored them for the onset of symptoms. Four (0.48%) exposed persons (one house officer, two non-clinical staff, and one",

In Hong Kong, the first confirmed case of S-OIV was diagnosed in a traveller from Mexico on 1 May 2009. 3 As of 20 August 2009, there were 8210 laboratory-confirmed cases with four deaths. Here, we report the effect of such measures on the occurrence of nosocomial S-OIV in our hospital.",

Open staff forum and special education sessions were arranged by the hospital administration and infection control team. Nasopharygneal aspirates or nasopharyngeal flocked swabs were collected from cases, either patients or HCWs, who had upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) symptoms. Direct immunofluorescent antigen test for influenza A and other respiratory viruses (influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3, and adenovirus) and reverse transcriptionepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for S-OIV H1 gene were performed, as previously described. 3, 4 The infection control team checked with the microbiology laboratory on a daily basis for positive results. Cases were reviewed to determine the route of acquisition. For patients, they were considered as having community-acquired infection if they presented with URTI symptoms within 48 h of admission, without history of contact with any confirmed case in the hospital. For HCWs, they were considered as having community-acquired infection if they had confirmed cases in their household with no history of unprotected exposure to any confirmed case in the hospital. Otherwise, the case was classified as nosocomial infection. Unprotected exposure was defined as the contact within 1 m between a confirmed case and the exposed with both of them not having worn a surgical mask, whereas protected exposure meant that either one had worn a surgical mask during their contact.",

Close contacts of the confirmed cases were quarantined. Close contacts were defined as individuals from the same household and flight passengers seated three rows in front or behind the confirmed cases. In phase 2, the early mitigation phase (from 18 June to 28 June 2009), all patients with laboratory-confirmed S-OIV were hospitalised for cohort nursing and consideration of antiviral therapy. During phase 3, the late mitigation phase (from 29 June 2009 onwards), only high risk patients (children aged 2 years or pregnant women) with S-OIV, and patients with clinical evidence of complicated influenza were admitted for further management.",

Contact tracing of the exposed inpatients and co-workers was followed by a seven-day medical surveillance. If the infected HCW had worn a surgical mask and practice hand hygiene during patient care, antiviral agent would not be prescribed to the exposed patients. However, oseltamivir (75 mg daily for 10 days) would be recommended to the co-workers as postexposure prophylaxis if they had not worn a surgical mask during tea break, lunch, and dinner with the infected staff.

Overall, nosocomial acquisition of S-OIV from hospitalised patients was two (0.43%) out of 466 exposed persons.",

Two HCWs (one dispenser and one workman in pharmacy) acquired S-OIV from another dispenser during the pre-symptomatic shedding period because surgical mask was not mandatory in non-clinical areas.

The implementation of infection control bundle in the first 100 days after the arrival of S-OIV in Hong Kong appeared to have minimised the nosocomial transmission of S-OIV among both patients and HCWs resulting in a secondary attack rate of 0.48%. It was much lower than a rate of 10e45% as reported in a recent review of published data on hospitalacquired influenza. 6 Enhancement of staff awareness of infection control practice in both the hospital and community is essential for the programme's success and avoidance of misunderstanding. Our infection control teaching session has provided coverage for more than 90% of hospital staff. Whenever patients or HCWs were In particular, when the HCWs were undergoing medical surveillance, they were strongly advised not to have tea, lunch, and dinner with other co-workers because the shedding of influenza virus could occur one day before onset of symptoms. This measure is important for stopping the chain of transmission among HCWs. Therefore, HCWs were released from clinical duty and required to seek medical consultation for appropriate testing. Such measures radically changed the past practice of not collecting nasopharyngeal specimens in our staff clinic.",

This shows that the routine use of surgical masks in all clinical areas is important in reducing the risk of nosocomial infection of S-OIV. According to our analysis, use of surgical masks by the exposed persons was associated with a lower risk of nosocomial acquisition of S-OIV, which was consistent with previous studies suggesting that wearing a surgical mask might decrease the risk of SARS infection. 7 This measure discouraged the use of fingers to touch the mucous membranes of the nostrils and mouth since such spontaneous behaviour was not infrequently observed. 8 Wearing surgical masks by the index persons as a form of source control also reduced the risk of transmission. As the use of surgical mask was mandatory for HCWs while in clinical areas, none of the 129 patients exposed to the clinical staff diagnosed with S-OIV during work acquired the infection despite not wearing masks themselves.",

It may be related to recall bias by the exposed person. Unexpectedly the practice of hand hygiene after contact with the index cases did not reach statistical significance in reducing nosocomial infection of S-OIV in our study. This could be due to the small sample size in the group of infected persons. In fact, hand hygiene practice by using alcohol-based hand rub has been consistently promoted in our hospital since 2006 and directly observed hand hygiene (DOHH) has been strategically implemented during outbreaks. DOHH has been shown to be effective in reducing the frequency and the number of persons involved in the nosocomial outbreaks in our previous studies. 2, 9 There are several limitations to this study. First, it was a quasi-experimental design to assess the nosocomial transmission of S-OIV, based on the epidemiological analysis of clinical symptoms of the exposed persons without serological confirmation. This might have underestimated the true incidence of nosocomial transmission. Second, the gradual decrease in the incidence of nosocomial influenza A and other respiratory virus infections may also be attributable to our ongoing promotion of infection control practice, which has been intensified at the time of the S-OIV pandemic. Third, the sustainability of this programme remains questionable since the workload of laboratory staff, infection control team, and the frontline HCWs has greatly increased during the current pandemic. The recent finding of viral pneumonitis in animal models and mortality in immunocompetent young adults due to S-OIV have reminded us that this novel virus may be more pathogenic than seasonal influenza virus. 10 As the first wave in the summer may be mild, this infection control bundle may play an even more impartant role during the second wave of this pandemic in the winter time.",

Along with the basic and special infection control training sessions previously held before the outbreak of S-OIV, 4618 (92.8%) of the hospital staff have attended infection control training in the past 18 months. Video demonstrations of gowning and degowning of personal protective equipment were provided to all isolation wards and uploaded to the hospital intranet for regular revision by frontline HCWs. Briefly, a surgical mask, protective eyewear and gown were recommended when the HCWs were within 1 m of contact with the suspected cases in isolation rooms. N95 respirator, cap and gloves were to be worn in addition to face shield and gown when aerosol generating procedures were performed. The incidence of nosocomial infection of influenza A and other respiratory viruses gradually decreased from 0.25 and 0.86 per 10 000 patient-days in 2007, to 0.14 and 0.45 per 10 000 patient-days in 2008, and 0.05 and 0.15 per 10 000 patient-days, in the first six months of 2009. Previous audit of hand hygiene practice had shown a gradual increase in compliance in all clinical departments from 2006 (25%) to 2008 (59%). When a snapshot audit was performed in early August 2009, the overall hand hygiene compliance of hospital staff was consistently between 50 and 60%. The consumption of alcohol-based hand rub increased from 0.53 L per 100 admissions in 2006 to 7.78 L per 100 admissions in 2008. Since the gradual implementation of the infection control bundle to the full in May, 13.08 L per 100 admissions of alcohol-based hand rub have been consumed during the first six months of 2009.",
