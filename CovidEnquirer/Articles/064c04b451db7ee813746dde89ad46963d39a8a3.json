The complexation of actinides with potentially stable anthropogenic ligands facilitate the transportation and migration of the actinides from the source confinement. The present study describes the determination of thermodynamic parameters for the complexation of Th(IV) with the three isomeric pyridine monocarboxylates (PCNO) namely picolinic acid-N-oxide (PANO), nicotinic acid-N-oxide (NANO) and isonicotinic acid-N-oxide (IANO). The potentiometric and isothermal calorimetric titrations were carried out to determine the stability and enthalpy of the formations for all the Th(IV)-PCNO complexes. Th-PANO complexes are more stable than Th-NANO and Th-IANO complexes which can be attributed to chelate formation in the former complexes. Formation of all the Th-PCNO complexes are endothermic and are entropy driven. The geometries for all the predicted complexes are optimized the energies, bond distances and charges on individual atoms are obtained using TURBOMOLE software. The theoretical calculation corroborated the experimental determinations.",

N-oxides also play a significant role in materials chemistry. Pyridine and quinoline N-oxides find their application in regioselective and enantioselective catalysis [3, 4] . Many heteroaromatic N-oxides are identified as potential anticancer and antimalarial drugs or reductors of bacterial deposition [5] [6] [7] and as antitumor agents [8] . Further, N-oxides play an important role in the metabolism of drugs for the treatment of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) [9] or HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) [10] .

Through feed wastes or from wastewater treatment plants, N-oxides may contaminate the soils, sediments, and aquatic environments [20] .Thus, it is important to study the interaction of these N-oxide moieties with various metal ions present in aquatic environments which in turn will provide information on the fate of these contaminants in the aquatic environments. Monodentate pyridine N-oxides have the ability to form complexes yielding maximum coordination numbers for most metal ions [21] . The N-O moiety of pyridine N-oxides possesses a unique functionality which can act effectively as a push electron donor and as a pull electron acceptor group [22] . Further, certain functional groups on pyridine N-oxides, can serve as donor sites leading to the formation of chelate complexes. For example, 2-substituted pyridine N-oxides are capable of bidentate coordination with metals and have been extensively investigated as new sequestering agents for actinide(IV) ions by Raymond and his group [23, 24] .",

Density functional theory based calculations have also been carried out to estimate the interaction energies, bond lengths, bond angles and charges on individual atoms in the complexes formed to support the experimental studies. The potentiometric and isothermal calorimetric titrations were carried out to determine the stability constants (log b) and complexation enthalpies (DH) respectively for all the thorium pyridine monocarboxylic acid-N-oxides complexes formed during the course of reaction. These measurements in turn provided the data on in free energy (DG) and entropy of formation (DS).",

Suprapure (70%) perchloric acid and high pure sodium hydroxide (>99.99% purity) pellets were used for the preparations of perchloric acid and sodium hydroxide working solutions respectively. Potassium hydrogen phthalate was used as primary standard to determine the strength of NaOH solution. The ligand solution for complexation titration were prepared by dissolving appropriate amounts in milliQ water and required amounts of standardized NaOH was added to make them half neutralized. The preparation and standardization of thorium perchlorate solution was done as in our previous work [45] .

Prior to potentiometric titrations, the inner filling solution (saturated KCl) of glass electrode was replaced with 1.0 mol/dm 3 NaClO 4 to prevent the coagulation of frit by the formation of KClO 4 . The electrode calibration was performed by carrying out a titration of strong acid (HClO 4 ) vs. strong base (NaOH) to determine the electrode parameters like standard electrode potential of the cell (E 0 ), slope of electrode, carbonate impurity in alkali using GLEE software [67] . The emf of the electrode was recorded as a function of the volume of the base and the emf vs. pH showed a linear plot in both the acidic and basic regions indicating a good performance of the electrode over complete pH range of usage. Titration of the metal ion solution with the standard alkali ($0.1 mol/dm 3 NaOH) was employed to determine the proton concentration in the metal ion solution by Gran's method [68] . The complexation titrations were carried out by addition of half neutralized ligand solution to a fixed volume of thorium working solution. The electrode potential at each addition of ligand was measured after equilibration for180 seconds, or until the drift in the potential had reached less than 0.2 mV/sec. The detailed concentrations of ligand and metal solutions were labeled in the speciation figure captions in the results and discussion section. All the titration were carried out at 298 K temperature and in 1.0 mol/dm 3 ionic strength adjusted by NaClO 4 . The Hyperquad suit of programming [69] was used to determine the stability constants and the complexes formed during the course of metal-ligand titration to generate the speciation diagrams.",

(2) represents the complexation of thorium with protonated ligand in which the complex formation is accompanied by the release of proton. Thus, the complexation of metal ion with acidic ligands like carboxylates and aminocarboxylates, is always accompanied by deprotonation of ligand, and hence necessitates the determination of thermodynamic parameters for ligand protonation. The protonation constants of all the three pyridine monocarboxylates under present experimental conditions were taken from our previous work [90] as inputs to analyze the potentiometric data of Th-PCNO complexation to determine the stability constants of all the complexes formed during the course of reaction. The potentiometric titration data was analyzed by using Hyperquad suit of programming [69] . The software involves the treatment of data by a non-linear least square fitting of experimental data with a modeled data in which the approximate species that can form during the complexation reaction along with their stability constants is given as input. When the species expected with the given stability constants are reasonably well predicted, the modeled data matches with experimental data indicating the validity of predicted species with corresponding stability constants. Different stoichiometry of Th-PCNO complexes including the polynuclear and ternary Th-PCNO-OH complexes are considered during the treatment of data by Hyperquad but consideration of only mononuclear binary Th-PCNO complexes resulted in the best fit of the data. The potentiometric data analysis by Hyperquad indicated the formation of ML j (j = 1-4) for Th-PANO complexes and ML j (j = 1-3) for Th-NANO and Th-IANO complexes. The variation in the percentage of formation of the different stoichiometric complexes with respect to total metal concentration and pH can be well represented as speciation diagrams (Fig. 2 ). The speciation diagrams are very much helpful in predicting the concentrations of various complexes present under any experimental condition (pH, Ligand to Metal ratio). The stability constants along with the other thermodynamic parameters (DG, DH and DS) are given in Table 1 .",

The higher log b values of the Th-PANO complexes can be attributed to the formation of six membered chelate ring involving the oxygen of N-oxide and that of carboxylate. The favorable position of N-oxide (at ortho position) to carboxylate group facilitates the chelate formation while the same cannot take place in Th-NANO and Th-IANO complexes due to higher separation of N-oxide with respect to carboxylate. Th-IANO forms stronger complexes than corresponding Th-NANO complexes as the carboxylate group in the former is in electron donating position (para) to N-oxide moiety for charge polarization where the same in NANO is at electron withdrawing position (meta) to N-oxide moiety. The actinides at higher oxidation state behave as hard acids and prefer binding with hard donors like fluorine, oxygen, etc., in which the major force of attraction is Coulombic in nature. Thus the actinides interactions (log K ML ) would follow a linear relation with the protonation constants (log K P ) of ligands. Such linear free energy relationship for the complexation of thorium with simple monocarboxylates is shown in Fig. 3 . From the plot (Fig. 3) , it could be observed that the Th-PANO complex is much above the line corresponding to Th(IV)-monocarboxylates indicating chelation in Th(IV)-PANO complexes. However, the log K ML data for Th(IV)-IANO and Th(IV)-NANO was found to fall on linear free energy relationship for the complexation of thorium with simple monocarboxylates indicating similar binding through carboxylate group.",

From the table, it's clear that formation of all the Th(IV)-PCNO complexation are endothermic in nature and are mainly entropy driven. The hard acid-hard base interactions involved in actinide complexation by PCNOs constitute positive enthalpy reflecting the energy required for dehydration of both the metal ion and the ligands and a favorable entropy due to increase in disorder caused by the release of solvent molecules in both the primary as well as secondary solvation spheres, the bulk solvent and their reorganization around the resulting species. Furthermore, the similarity in enthalpy and entropy of formation between Th(IV)-NANO and Th(IV)-IANO complexation implies that the oxygen of N-oxide of NANO/IANO does not participate in the complexation process for coordination with Th(IV).",

            "text": "The trends in enthalpy of formation for complexes can be explained in terms of the perturbation of hydration sphere in the primary coordination sphere as well as in bulk structure of solvent. In general the stepwise enthalpy of formation follows a descending order as the charge neutralization becomes more prominent in the stepwise complexation process. Similar trends in enthalpy of formation were observed in case of Th-NANO and Th-IANO complexes but in case of Th-PANO complexes, the enthalpy of formation follows a different trend DH ML2 > DH ML3 > DH ML > DH ML4 . This anomaly in the enthalpy of formation could be explained on the basis of dehydration of both the metal ion and ligand molecules on complex formation. In general, ligand dehydration plays minor role in determining the enthalpy of formation as in case of simple monocarboxylates and neutral ligands like NANO and IANO for which the enthalpy of protonation are \u00c01.83 and 0.40 kJ/mol respectively [90] , typical of carboxylic acids (DH P % 0-5 kJ/mol at 298 K). But, in case of ligands that do have relatively higher endothermic enthalpies of protonation, ligand deprotonation contributes more to the enthalpy of formation of the complex with the metal ion. In our previous studies [90] , it was reported that the protonation of PANO is an endothermic process (DH P = 6.76 kJ/mol) indicating an energy requirement for dehydration of deprotonated PANO in order to undergo complexation with Th(IV). Thus, the addition of more and more ligand requires higher energy for dehydration of ligand molecules, which results in higher enthalpies of formation as well as higher entropy of formation on stepwise complexation. Further, the drastic structural rearrangements of the ligand moieties around the metal ion also contribute to the abrupt increase of stepwise enthalpies of formation as in case of Th(IV) complexation by oxydiacetate complex for which DH for the formation of ML, ML 2 and ML 3 are 8.37, \u00c011.46 and 35.90 kJ/mol respectively. Thus the anomalous trend in enthalpy of formation for Th(IV)-PANO complexes could be attributed to the cumulative effect of dehydration of both the metal and ligand ions and the structural rearrangement of ligand around the metal ion simultaneously [91] . The entropy of formation for a complex consists of three components namely translational, rotational, and conformational. The change in vibrational entropy can usually be neglected. Quantitative evaluation of the entropy effect in complexation is difficult as these three constituents terms of entropy of formation of a complex are not easy to assess and the information on the solvation of the ligand is rarely available [92] . Relatively higher entropy of formation for Th-PANO complexes is due to chelate formation in these complexes which requires replacement of two water molecules from the primary coordination sphere of Th(IV) ion whereas NANO and IANO need to remove single water molecule from Th(IV) aquo ion for complexation. The trends in entropy of formation for Th-PANO can be explained on similar lines as in enthalpy of formation of these complexes.",

Tsushima et al. proved that the energy difference between 9-and 10-coordination for Th(IV) is very small, about 1 kJ/mol [94] . From these data it can be concluded that the coordination number is either 9 or 10, and that equilibrium might exist between the 9-and 10-coordinated ions. The relative energies of U 4+ and Np 4+ ions with 8, 9 and 10 coordinated water indicate that the preferred coordination number for U 4+ is 9, while there might be an equilibrium between 8 and 9 coordination for Np 4+ [95] . Thus, in the present studies, Th(H 2 O) 9 4+ is considered as the base moiety for Th(IV) aqua ion so that the studies can also be related to the other tetravalent actinides such as U(IV) and to a less extent to Np(IV).

The charges on both the oxygen atoms of the carboxylate group are lower in complex than that on bare ligand. This trend in charges on nitrogen and oxygen atoms of Noxide and oxygen atoms of carboxylate group is opposite to the trend observed in Th(IV)-PANO complexes. The charge on carbon atoms is more in complex form than in bare ligand for all the three Th(IV)-PCNO complexes. In case of Th(IV)-PANO complexes, PANO binds Th(IV) by chelation through the oxygen atom of N-oxide moiety and the oxygen atom of carboxylate. Thus the coulombic interaction with these two atoms would be more resulting in higher charge polarization at these two atoms during complex formation. Large difference in charge on oxygen atoms of carboxylate also further supports the monodentate nature of carboxylate in complexation process and hence chelate formation in case of PANO binding by Th(IV). In case of Th(IV)-NANO/IANO complexes, the metal ion binds the ligand through both the oxygen atoms of the carboxylate group which is evident from the similar charge on both the oxygen atoms on complex formation also. Both the oxygen of N-oxide and carboxylate functional attached to base pyridine ring in the PCNOs are electron withdrawing groups and can pull the electron density towards them from the base pyridine ring. Further, the electron withdrawing effects in pyridine ring are more pronounced at ortho and para positions which are more favorable positions for charge polarization than meta position.
