Activity against bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella choleraesuis) was tested with the AOAC use-dilution method and the first tier of a quantitative carrier test (QCT-1). Mycobactericidal activity was tested against Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium terrae using a quantitative suspension test (QST) and QCT-1, respectively. Fungicidal activity (Trichophyton mentagrophytes) was determined with the AOAC test and QCT-1. Activity against several enveloped and nonenveloped viruses was evaluated using the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) method No. E-1053. Sanitizing action was tested against 7 types of vegetative bacteria with method No. DIS/TSS-10. All microbicidal tests contained an added soil load; in all AOAC tests, it was 5% fetal bovine serum, and, in QCT-1, a mixture of 3 types of proteins in phosphate buffer was used instead. The methods to test for acute oral, dermal, inhalation toxicities, and dermal and eye irritation as well as skin sensitization complied with the requirements of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the US Environmental Protection Agency (OPPTS 870). Standard methods were also used to test compatibility with metals and plastics. Results: At 20\u00b0C, the full-strength product was bactericidal and virucidal in 1 minute and mycobactericidal and fungicidal in 5 minutes. It was nonirritating to skin and eyes. The acute oral LD 50 (lethal dose 50%) was .5000 mg/kg. It was compatible with 12 types of plastic and 3 out of 4 metals.",

Fourteen types of chemicals singly or in various combinations are in over 90% of the products currently used for this purpose, 2 and several of them either have a rate of microbial kill too slow for field use and/or a poor safety profile. 2 Hydrogen peroxide is among the oldest microbicides known, and it is generated naturally in many settings. However, it is relatively unstable by its very nature and somewhat slow acting when used on its own. 12 Both of these weaknesses have been addressed in that it is now possible to produce highly stabilized forms of H 2 O 2 in solution and also speed up its microbicidal action. Furthermore, its corrosivity has been tamed, thus widening its materials compatibility. The AHP technology has combined these developments to enhance the potential of H 2 O 2 as a microbicide, resulting in formulations for a variety of applications. 13, 14 The stabilizers, surfactants, and other excipients in these formulations have a high safety and biodegradability profile and are free from aquatic toxicants such as nonyl phenol ethoxylates (NPEs) or alkyl phenyl ethoxylates (APEs). 15, 16 The findings summarized here further substantiate the desirable attributes of the AHP-based formulation evaluated.",
