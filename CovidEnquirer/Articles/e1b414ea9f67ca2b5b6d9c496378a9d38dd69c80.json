            "text": "In the past 25 yr, there have been major contributions to knowledge about infectious processes and immune responses in dairy cattle, the most troublesome of which (exclusive of mastitis, which is given special attention elsewhere in this series of anniversary manuscripts) appear to be those afflicting mucous membranes of the respiratory, alimentary, and genital tracts. Many of them manifest similar signs of illness, so that differential diagnosis is difficult. Many are caused by viruses against which therapeutic agents are ineffective and against which immunoglobulin is not always available at the site of attack. Despite these deficiencies, unfolding knowledge about molecular characteristics of viruses and immune systems has clairified much of the mystery about infectious diseases and body responses to invading microorganisms. This paper deals with selected infectious diseases that have tested the cutting edge of scientific inquiry during the past quarter century. They are arranged alphabetically to avoid illusion that one is more important than another; related diseases are introduced within the discussion of the major title. Omissions may concern readers who may feel that certain diseases have been overlooked. Those included were compiled after querying colleagues in the United States and requesting that they assign priority ratings to diseases they judged of major importance. Represented here, then, are those regarded as being contemporary problems with advanced, but incomplete, knowledge.",

The virus usually causes gross swelling of the teat wall. Within 48 h, the skin over the affected areas becomes soft and sloughs, revealing an irregularly shaped, painful, deeply ulcerated area which heals slowly, healing accompanied by the formation of brown scabs. Healing usually occurs within a week after skin lesions appear. The scabs begin to shed after about 2 wk. Lymph gland swelling occurs, and mastitis follows in approximately 22% of the cases. The causative herpesvirus probably is transmitted mechanically by milkers and milking machines or by biting flies (24) .

Further, the trend has led to recognition of the probability that the disease might not be eliminated by conventional test and slaughter methods.

It is found abundantly in carnivora and omnivora but sparsely in horses and cattle and may or may not be pathogenic. Its pathogenic propensity is regulated by plasmid-mediated determinants that, in addition to providing filamentous surface antigens on the organism that facilitate adhesion to the epithelium of the intestine and thence colonization and proliferation, cause the organism to produce a path opotentiating diarrhea-inducing enterotoxin or sometimes a neurotoxin, which also is vasotoxic and produces enterotoxemic systemic disease (13) . A third toxin, which is produced by all coliform bacteria, rarely causing diarrhea, is endotoxin. E. coli endotoxin is responsible for systemic colibacillosis in immunoglobulin-deficient calves. This occurs even in calves that ingest but do not absorb protective quantities of colostral antibody (19, 41) . Although the alimentary tract is usually the portal of entry, signs of nonenterotoxemic systemic colibacillosis in calves may or may not be accompanied by diarrhea or alimentary tract injury. It is important to emphasize that ordinarily endotoxin does not cause fluid loss from the intestine. Usually, manifestations of endotoxin injury are associated with hyperthermia, lethargy, complement activation, neutrophil degranulation, and various toxic effects on the vascular system that may culminate in irreversible, fatal shock. Signs include fever, depression, vomiting, trembling, edema, increased respiration, and some hemorrhage (41) .",

In advanced leprosy the typical inflammatory cells have been termed \"leprosy cells\", enlarged maerophages with vacuolated, frothy cytoplasma resulting from the accumulation of lipid substances and bacillary debris. Although such cells are not identified clearly in Johne's disease, vacuolation of cytoplasm and lipid degeneration of epithelioid cells has been noticed (9), with clumping, distortion, and dissolution of bacilli within these cells. In the adjacent draining lymph nodes, large areas of lymphoid cells within the paracortical zone have been replaced by granulomatous inflammatory infiltrates in both diseases (9) . The similarity in the histopathologic findings of leprosy and of paratuberculosis have attracted pathologists studying paratuberculosis to the adaptation of Ridley and Jopling's morphologic classification of leprosy for paratuberculosis, hence, the inclination among some pathologists to refer to Johne's disease on cellular morphologic grounds as bovine leprosy (9) .",

            "text": "Doubts have been raised about the protective nature of antibody in chronic, progressive, infectious diseases. In such diseases, it is thought that antibody may protect the etiologic agent rather than the host (9) . There is evidence that such antibody abrogates effective cellular immunity and actually enhances dissemination of lesions in some chronic infectious diseases. The mechanism of enhancement of disease by antibody should be suspect when a disease normally controlled by cellular immunity suddenly undergoes rapid dissemination of lesions, such as is seen classically in miliary tuberculosis (9) . One must examine this question critically in Johne's disease. Does this occur in those clinical cases of Johne's disease resulting in diarrhea, emaciation, and death, as distinguished from the infected animals that show inapparent infection? If so, the value of vaccination needs critical reevaluation. In that evaluation, however, one must be sensitive to experience with other vaccines in similar modes. For example, the appearance of miliary tuberculosis in young children is rare after BCG vaccination (15) . The BCG is a strain of originally virulent M. boris attenuated by Calmette and Guerin by serial passage on inhibitory media. It is assumed that the effectiveness of the vaccine is dependent upon development of humoral antibody.",
