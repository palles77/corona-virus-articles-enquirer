Sensitivity to antiviral activities of the rFelFN varied with cell types; Felis cams whole fetus (fcwf-4) cells were more sensitive than Crandell feline kidney cells, but no sensitivity was found for Madin-Darby canine kidney cells when vesicular stomatitis virus was used as a challenge virus. Reductions were generally IFN dose-dependent and were more consistent when the cells were continuously treated with the rFelFN than when they were pretreated only before viral challenge. Compared with each virus control culture of fcwf-4 cells, yields of rotavirus, feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV), feline calicivirus and feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus were reduced by ranges of 1.3 to ~< 3.1 loglo, 0.6 to 1.6 log2, 0.8 to 3.7 log~o and 0.5 to 0.6 log~o, respectively, in the cultures continuously treated with 10 to 10000 U of the rFelFN. The yield reduction of FPLV was considered to be in part attributable to inhibition of cell growth by the rFeIFN supplemented in the medium.",

Furthermore, some in vivo experiments which used HulFN-a alone for FIP (Weiss et al., 1990) and feline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR) (Cocker et al., 1987) or in combination with antiviral drugs such as zidovudine for FeLV infected cats (Cummins et al., 1988; Zeidner et al., 1990) have been described (for review, Rollinson, 1992) . Results obtained in such studies have indicated that: HulFN-a may be a useful drug for therapeutic use in FVR cats; it can be applied as an auxiliary, rather than primary, treatment for FIP; or the continued efficacy of HulFN-a therapy for FeLV infections appeared to be limited due to the induction of cytokine-specific neutralizing antibodies.",

They cloned a cDNA fragment coding for IFN from a cDNA library constructed from mRNA extracted from the feline lymphoblastoid cells established previously by Yamamoto et al. (1986) . The amino acid sequence of the rFelFN has about 60% homology to HulFN-a 1, suggesting that it is a-type (Nakamura et al., 1992) . Thus, mass production of this rFelFN has now become possible and evaluation experiments are now being carried out. The purpose of this study was to evaluate antiviral activities of this rFelFN on feline and canine cells subsequently challenged with feline enteropathogenic viruses.",

The growth inhibition of FPLV was shown in the cells continuously treated with 10 U of the rFeIFN, but little if any, in the cells pretreated with 10 U to 10000 U of the rFelFN (Table 1 ) . However, Wiedbrauk et al. (1986) claimed that slight reductions in yield of mink parvoviruses in cells treated with high concentrations ( 100 to 1000 U per ml) of the IFN were not considered significant, for the reasons that such high IFN concentration inhibit cell growth and delay the entry of cells into the S phase. This may result in reduction of virus replication in such cells because these autonomously replicating parvoviruses require one or more cellular functions generated during the S phase of the cellular division cycle. Although some experimental conditions of the present study differed from the previous one particularly in the use of actively dividing cells, it is reasonable to consider that the yield reduction detected in the present study is also partly attributable to the inhibition of cell growth by the rFelFN as presented in Table 2 .",

The results indicate that certain degrees of antiviral effects against rotavirus, FIPV, FCV and FPLV can be generated in the feline cells by treatment with the rFelFN. Thus, it will be worthwhile to know its potential as an antiviral drug given orally for prophylaxis of enteritis, because this administration route of IFN has already been described in cats (Cummins et al., 1988) .",
