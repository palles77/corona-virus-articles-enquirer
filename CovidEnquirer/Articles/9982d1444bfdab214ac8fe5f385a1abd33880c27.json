It has also been documented in the wild House Finch (Carpodacus mexicanus). 6 Three forms of the avipoxvirus are seen and may occur simultaneously, e,3,7 The cutaneous form may first present as conjunctivitis and blepharitis. These symptoms give way to development of yellow-to-brown papules which progress to vesicles that open, dry, and form a wart-like lesion. These lesions are found on the unfeathered portions of the skin (head, eyes, beak, nares, and feet). The diphtheric form results in the formation of a necrotic membrane covering the mouth and larynx. The respiratory form presents with acute onset of dyspnea, cyanosis, and ruffled feathers. Mortality may reach 100% within 3 days of the onset of clinical signs. A desquamative pneumonia resulting in airsacculitis, necrotizing bronchitis, and hemorrhagic lungs is usually present. 7 In all 3 forms, Bollinger bodies (intracytoplasmic lipophilic inclusion bodies) are characteristic of the avipoxvirus and are usually present in the affected tissues. They may be visualized on histopathology with a cytologic (Wright's) stain. 8 Mosquitoes, mites, and contact through traumatized epithelial surfaces transmit avipoxvirus from bird to bird. An attenuated-live vaccine for avipoxvirus is available and should be used in high risk situations as a pre-ventative measure 1 month before the onset of mosquito seasonY ,~,7,9 High-risk birds are those living in outdoor aviaries with a dense mosquito population. The vaccination should be repeated annually. Caution must be exercised when vaccinating during an outbreak to prevent the transmission of the virus during the handling and vaccination procedures. Canaries will develop immunity for 3 to 6 months following vaccination. 7",

Treatment must include an insecticide for the bird and removal of the birds from the aviary for thorough cleaning and disinfection. Ornithonyssus sylviarum, the northern mite, is a problem in aviaries. This blood-sucking mite spends its life on the host. Knemidokoptes pilae is often called the scaly face or scaly leg mite. This mite may be carried latently after infection in the nest or by direct transfer from bird to bird. This mite tunnels into the stratum corneum layer of the skin to cause proliferative crusty lesions on the featherless parts of the face, legs, and vent. Scrapings of the affected area will often reveal the mite. This condition should be distinguished from \"tassel foot\" in the goldfinch, which is caused by a papillomavirus, s,7,43 Treatment for all mite infections may include the use of ivermectin topically or orally at 200 to 400 /,g/kg once weekly for 3 to 6 weeks. Some situations may require dusting the infected birds with an insecticide or hanging a pest strip in a well-ventilated room that is not accessible to the birds. Caution must be used with dusts and sprays in the nestling, a",

Certainly the stress factors of nutrition, husbandry practices, breeding, and exposure to multiple birds play an important role in the development of disease. It would not be uncommon for the ill bird to present with more than 1 problem. Viral infections with secondary bacterial infections are not uncommon. Fungal disease usually affects those birds that are immunosuppressed or suffering from some other ailment. Treatment regimes are based on the diseases present and often require thoughtful planning to treat a large number of aviary birds.",

The duodenum may become edematous and hemorrhagic with trophozoites present in the affected duodenum. Wet mounts of the droppings may reveal large numbers of the oocysts. 25 Research in captive Nashville Warblers (Vevyaivora ruficap-iUa) demonstrated coccidial infections secondary to the immunosuppressive effects of a lymphoid neoplasm. Concurrent coccidiosis and lymphosarcoma has been described in captive passerines, but it is unlikely that the coccidia had a primary role in the lymphogenesis. 26 Control of coccidiosis includes strict hygiene and treatment with coccidiostat drugs. A regimen of sulfachlorpyridazine (Vetisulid, Solvay Animal Health Inc., Mendota Heights, MN) in the drinking water at 300 mg/L for 5 days, stopped for 2 days, and then continued for 4 treatment cycles may significantly reduce or totally clear fecal oocyst shedding for an extended period of time. This drug appears to affect only the intestinal stages of the parasite.27 Toltrazuril (Baycox, Bayvet Bayer Corporation, Shawnee Mission, KS) at 75 mg/L drinking water for 2 days each week for 4 treatment cycles in canaries, and 12.5 mg/kg orally every/24 hours for 14 days in the Bali Mynah (Leucopsar rothschildi), has been used in attempts/to affect the systemic stages of coccidial infectiol~s. 27'28 Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Bactriha, Roche Alpharma USPD Inc., Balti-more, MD) and sulfadimethoxine (Albon, SmithKline Pfizer Inc., New York, NY) have also been used with limited success. Atoxoplasmosis Atoxoplasma parasites are most likely related to the coccidial genus Isospora. As stated previously, Isospora coccidia typically remain within the intestine. Atoxoplasma spp undergo an asexual life cycle in mononuclear blood cells and can spread hematogenously to the liver, lung, or spleen. Asexual and sexual cycles are also present in the intestinal mucosa. 3,7,25,2~ Because Atoxoplasma spp are commonly found in tissues other than the intestines, the genus was named and promoted as distinct in the early literature. However, Isospora serini does have an extraintestinal form in canaries, a fact that has led some researchers to believe that I serini is the coccidial parasite responsible for this disease. 25Because Isospora spp are often very species-specific, it is possible that other species of Isospora",
