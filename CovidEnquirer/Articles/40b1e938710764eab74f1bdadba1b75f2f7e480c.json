OBJECTIVE: To study whether RSV or RV types are differentially associated with the future use of asthma control medication. METHODS: Over 2 consecutive winter seasons (2008-2010), we enrolled 408 children hospitalized for bronchiolitis at age less than 24 months into a prospective, 3-center, 4-year follow-up study in Finland. Virus detection was performed by real-time reverse transcription PCR from nasal wash samples. Four years later, we examined current use of asthma control medication. RESULTS: A total of 349 (86%) children completed the 4-year follow-up. At study entry, the median age was 7.5 months, and 42% had RSV, 29% RV, 2% both RSV and RV, and 27% non-RSV/-RV etiology. The children with RV-A (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.3; P [ .01), RV-C (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.5; P < .001), and non-RSV/-RV (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.0; P [ .004) bronchiolitis started the asthma control medication earlier than did children with RSV bronchiolitis. Four years later, 27% of patients used asthma control medication; both RV-A (adjusted odds ratio, 3.0; P [ .03) and RV-C (adjusted odds ratio, 3.7; P < .001) etiology were associated with the current use of asthma medication. The highest risk was found among patients with RV-C, atopic dermatitis, and fever (adjusted odds ratio, 5.0; P [ .03). CONCLUSIONS: Severe bronchiolitis caused by RV-A and RV-C was associated with earlier initiation and prolonged use of asthma control medication. The risk was especially high when bronchiolitis was associated with RV-C, atopic dermatitis, and fever. \u00d3",

[15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Cadherin-related family member 3 (a receptor for RV-C) and atopy have been shown to be risk factors for the development of early-onset asthma. 20 Cadherin-related family member 3 mediates RV-C binding and replication in airway epithelia, and polymorphism in gene encoding the protein has been linked with increased susceptibility to asthma. 21, 22 We aimed to study whether RSV or RV types are differently associated with the use of long-term asthma control medication during the 4 years after severe bronchiolitis during infancy. Our study hypothesis was that RV-A or RV-C etiology of severe bronchiolitis is associated with increased need for the long-term asthma control medication.",

The children were recruited from the pediatric wards or intensive care units of Kuopio, Tampere, and Turku University Hospitals in Finland during the winter seasons 2008 to 2010 (from November 1 until March 31). 23 The children were hospitalized for bronchiolitis and were younger than 24 months on admission. The diagnosis of bronchiolitis was clinical and made according to the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines including children with acute respiratory illness with some combination of rhinitis, cough, tachypnea, wheezing, crackles, and/or retractions. 1 No initial exclusions were made on the basis of history of wheezing or use of asthma medication before hospitalization. In addition, we identified a subgroup of 204 infants who were younger than 12 months with no history of wheezing (strict bronchiolitis criteria). 24, 25 The exclusion criteria were previous enrollment or transfer to a participating hospital more than 48 hours after the original admission time. Because all the children were hospitalized, they were defined as having a severe bronchiolitis. The Institutional Ethical Board of Turku University Hospital approved the study. The institutional ethical boards of other participating hospitals confirmed this approval. The parents or guardians gave written informed consent to the study.",

Third, patients with RV-C bronchiolitis, atopic dermatitis, and fever had the highest risk for the development of asthma.

            "text": "Several factors can contribute to the linkage of RV-induced wheezing in infancy with the risk of childhood asthma. The inflammatory response caused by different RVs might damage the airways, although RSV could cause even more structural damage to airway epithelium than RV. 11 However, changes in epithelial barrier function even before the infection can increase the risk of severe RV bronchiolitis, and host factors such as atopy and low IFN responses could have additive effects. In addition, risk genes such as cadherin-related family member 3 (encoding a receptor for RV-C) and 17q21 can predispose children to more severe RV-C infections and development of asthma. 8, 11, 21, 22, 31 Finally, RV infection can inhibit IFN responses and potentiate T H 2-celledriven inflammation and production of cytokines, which promote airway obstruction and wheeze. 10 Atopic characteristics are not seen as a risk factor for RSV-induced wheezing and asthma, which is more linked to young age and low lung function, indicating that the timing of RSV infection may be important for the future development of respiratory illnesses. 11 Similarly, genetic factors can modify the risk of RSV bronchiolitis and development of asthma. 10 Our finding of strong association of both RV-Ae and RV-Ceinduced bronchiolitis with the use of asthma control medication 4 years later is consistent with previous RV studies. In a recent meta-analysis including 15 original articles, the association between RV-induced wheezing and later development of asthma was confirmed. 32 In our previous report, the link between RV-A or RV-C and recurrences of wheezing was already evident at 12month follow-up. 27 Interestingly, in our study and others, the need for long-term asthma control medication typically develops within 2 years after RV-induced bronchiolitis. 28, 33, 34 Early-life RV wheezing illnesses and aeroallergen sensitization increase the risk of asthma. 10, 11 In a high-risk birth cohort, the persistence of asthma at age 13 years has been shown to be strongly and additively associated with RV wheezing illness and aeroallergen sensitization in early life. 8 In accordance, we show that histories of wheezing, atopic dermatitis, and RV-Ae and RV-Ceinduced bronchiolitis were independently associated with the initiation and the current use of asthma control medications 4 years later. Data from these studies suggest that atopic airways are more likely to develop obstructive changes after RV-related wheeze. Also, severe febrile viral respiratory infections in infancy and early atopy are known risk factors for persistent wheeze and asthma. 35 Similarly, in our study, the occurrence of RV-C bronchiolitis, atopic dermatitis, and fever together was an especially important marker of risk for wheeze and asthma later in childhood. Because bronchiolitis is defined differently in the United States and in Europe, we also analyzed the data using strict (European) criteria for bronchiolitis, for example, age less than 12 months and the first wheezing episode. 1, 24, 25 Using these strict criteria for bronchiolitis, RV-C bronchiolitis in the first year of life was strongly associated with increased use of asthma medication 4 years later, whereas RV-A bronchiolitis was very rare in this age group. This is in agreement with our previous report on recurrence of wheezing within 12-month follow-up. 27 The strengths of the study are the prospective design and longitudinal follow-up with high follow-up rates (86%). In this reallife study, only hospitalized patients with bronchiolitis who were younger than 2 years were included. We also conducted analyses separately for children with bronchiolitis by strict criteria, making the population more uniform and considering the possible effect of previous wheezing illnesses. In addition, the different viruses were evaluated at the time of bronchiolitis, and the later use of asthma medication was carefully characterized using registry data in addition to parental reporting. However, no further specific tests to confirm allergic sensitization were performed. One limitation is that the cohort includes only patients with severe bronchiolitis cases hospitalized before age 2 years. The role of viral infections may differ in children with milder forms of bronchiolitis.",

This study also suggests that a preventive strategy targeting either RV-A or especially RV-C, and the inflammatory response associated with these viruses, might help to prevent at least some types of childhood asthma.
