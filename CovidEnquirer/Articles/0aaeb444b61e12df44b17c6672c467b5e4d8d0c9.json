It was reported that aminopeptidase N (APN) is the receptor for transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and feline coronavirus (FeCoV) which all belong to group I coronavirus including as well as PEDV. It was also confirmed previously that porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) can bind to PEDV, and anti-pAPN antibodies may inhibit the combination. To investigate whether pAPN is a receptor for PEDV, we transfected MDCK cells with porcine aminopeptidase (pAPN) cDNA and this enabled non-susceptible cells to support PEDV replication and serial viral propagation. Moreover, the infection was blocked by antibodies against pAPN, implies the critical role of pAPN during virus entry. In addition, immunofluorescence assays for detection of pAPN and PEDV antigens, together with neutralization assays using antibodies against pAPN, further confirmed the correlation between pAPN expression and viral replication in pAPN-transfected MDCK cells. These results indicate that pAPN is a functional receptor for PEDV.",

TGEV could be propagated in many continuous cell lines, such as swine testicle (ST) cells and porcine kidney (PK-15) cells.

Viral RNA could be detected up to 5 serial passages, and PEDV at serial passage 5 could infect Vero cells as judged by the dose-dependent infection effect.

MDCK cell monolayers transfected with pcDNA3.1-pAPN expressed pAPN at a significantly high level compared with mock-transfected MDCK cells, ST cells and Vero cells (Delmas et al., 1992) . This indicates that there is a direct correlation between the efficiency of viral replication and pAPN expression. In addition, the presence of PEDV antigens in pAPN-expressing MDCK cells was proved by indirect immunofluorescence. However, attempts to infect pAPN-deficient MDCK cells with PEDV resulted in a rather low level of antigen proteins as determined by immunofluorescence assays. Moreover, anti-pAPN antiserum could inhibit CPEs significantly with a dose-dependent effect. From these results, we deduce that high-level expression of pAPN correlates with high-efficiency replication of PEDV, and the susceptibility to PEDV was conferred by pAPN expression in MDCK cells.",

            "text": "One explanation may be that pAPN density plays a critical role in PEDV infection. It is known that cellular receptor density plays a critical role for the entry of some virus, such as oncolytic measles virus and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (Reynes et al., 2000; Anderson et al., 2004) . As for natural PEDV infection, porcine intestinal tissues are rather sensitive and produce high-titer virus. In porcine intestinal brush border membrane, pAPN is abundantly expressed and constitutes of about 8% of the total membrane proteins. However, in ST cells, as shown in Fig. 2 , the expression level of pAPN is relatively low. The expression level of pAPN may be an important factor influencing PEDV entry. From our data, it can also be inferred that the density of pAPN and PEDV infectivity might be correlated, since high pAPN amount and enhanced replication of PEDVoriginate from the same source. It is possible that in the presence of trypsin, MDCK cells with high level of pAPN expression are quite similar to intestinal villus membrane. Thus we speculate that compared with TGEV, the infectivity of PEDV maybe much more restricted by pAPN density. Another possible explanation for the restriction of PEDV host range may be summarized as follows. This restriction could be due to a defect in entry or a post-entry event. Other unknown mechanisms might provide some supporting factors required for virus entry and replication capacity. It remains to be determined whether pAPN is sufficient for viral entry in some cell lines or a secondary or earlier event is responsible for promoting entry. In another word, it is likely that multiple receptor molecules mediate PEDV infection or the replication is restricted at a postentry step, and it is also possible that the modification of PEDV is needed. However, PEDV could infect Vero cells without pAPN. It may be due to other receptors or receptor-independent infection (Taguchi and Matsuyama, 2002) .",

After 36 h, virus-induced cytotoxicity was measured at 490 nm using CytoTox 96 nonradioactive cytotoxicity assay (Promega) according to the instruction of the manufacturer.
