Frailty has been demonstrated to be a potential confounder of VE 262 [38-40]. Frailty cannot be included in the multivariable model because no validated indices of frailty 263 generated from standard administrative data exist at this time. However, this may not affect the results 264 significantly as a previous study indicated that inclusion of frailty in the multivariate model increased VE 265 estimates only slightly [41]. Laboratory requisitions in Alberta do not contain illness onset date. Ideally this would be used to ensure that 267 the negative laboratory test results were representative of an acute infectious period and that test-negative 268 specimens were not collected after viral shedding had ceased. Sullivan et al 2016 have indicated this bias may 269 be accounted for by selecting influenza test-negative controls that were positive for another respiratory virus. Requiring controls to be positive for another virus excludes individuals who are tested long after their acute 271 infectious period.

Finally, we are certain to capture the results of all respiratory virus testing in the province, as all respiratory 257 virus testing is centralized at ProvLab and there is limited use of point-of-care testing. There are some limitations to this methodology compared to the traditional method of VE estimation using 259 sentinel physician networks, because a standardized clinical case definition cannot be applied to determine 260 study eligibility. A sensitivity analysis restricting to healthcare encounters with a diagnosis code for ARI will 261 be used as a proxy for a standard case definition. While the inclusion of confounders is important for VE estimate adjustment, not all known confounders can 263 be measured using administrative data. Frailty has been demonstrated to be a potential confounder of VE 264 [39-41]. Frailty cannot be included in the multivariable model because no validated indices of frailty 265 generated from standard administrative data exist at this time. However, this may not affect the results 266 significantly as a previous study indicated that inclusion of frailty in the multivariate model increased VE 267 estimates only slightly [42]. Laboratory requisitions in Alberta do not contain illness onset date. Ideally this would be used to ensure that 269 the negative laboratory test results were representative of an acute infectious period and that test-negative 270 specimens were not collected after viral shedding had ceased. Sullivan et al 2016 have indicated this bias may 271 be accounted for by selecting influenza test-negative controls that were positive for another respiratory virus. Requiring controls to be positive for another virus excludes individuals who are tested long after their acute 273 infectious period. However, a recent systematic review found no differences when using different groups of 274 controls [43]. Comparison of the VE results using administrative data to previously published studies, specifically sentinel 276 surveillance for the same seasons (2011/12 -2018/19) will help to identify further areas of refinement. For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml This approach could successfully allow for the generation of early influenza VE estimates which could 278 facilitate tailoring of public health messaging and assist in public health operations planning for the peak of 279 the influenza season.
