Spectroscopic analyses are sensitive to variations in the biochemical composition of the sample, are non-destructive, fast and require the least sample preparation, making spectroscopic techniques tools of great interest in biological studies. Herein important chemometric algorithms that have been used in virological studies are also evidenced as a good alternative for analyzing the spectra, discrimination and classification of samples. Techniques that have not yet been used in the field of virology are also suggested. This methodology emerges as a new and promising field of research, and may be used in the near future as diagnosis tools for detecting diseases caused by viruses.",

They investigated IR spectra of homogenized tissues to find disease indicators, but used a single beam and manually scanned instruments which resulted in low sensitivity and reproducibility.

The results showed that SERS combined with these multivariate methods can be used as a rapid methodology for identification and viral classification. In the study by Moor et al.

From the information obtained by NMR, it was concluded that there are 9 biomarkers with greatest discriminant significance: citrate, glutamine, acetone, pyruvate, b-hydroxyisobutyrate, acetoacetate, histidine, dimethylamine, and creatinine. Significantly higher amounts of these metabolites were found in patients with AIH compared to healthy controls or other diseases.

Using Raman spectroscopy it is possible to detect the presence of a wide range of polar or non-polar chemical bonds, including cellular changes. In this technique, the photons from a monochromatic light source interact with the chemical bonds present in the sample. These photons are absorbed (increasing the vibrational energy of the molecules), and then released (causing the vibrational energy of the molecules to return to their initial state). In this process an inelastic scattering phenomenon can occur, which is when the molecule does not return to a vibratory state of initial energy; then the released photon has a frequency deviation, which maintains the equilibrium of the system. This happens with less than 1% of absorbed photons and 99% are emitted due to elastic scattering. This anomalous scattering can be measured to give what is known as a Raman signal [24] . The inelastic scattering is composed of Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering, which occurs in 1 in 10 million absorbed photons; where the first (Stoke scattering) occurs when the molecule absorbs part of the energy of the incoming wavelength, thereby emitting a wavelength of less energy than the wavelength received; and the anti-Stokes scattering occurs when the molecule releases a wavelength of greater energy than that absorbed. This happens under certain circumstances where the molecule is in a partially excited energy state before absorbing the wavelength received.",

(2015) [26] demonstrated the potential of 150 nm gold nanoparticles to generate surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) signals to analyze biological samples, noting that high Raman regions co-localize with the presence of these nanoparticles. Compared with smaller nanoparticles (40 nm), the larger nanoparticles (150 nm) are more easily detectable. Moreover, instead of the signal spreading throughout the cell surface, it appears to be highly localized in the regions surrounding these nanoparticles, giving support to the SERS effect theory. Another advantage of larger nanoparticles is that although their aggregates, even individual particles can be optically observed. This allows areas with abundance of these nanoparticles to be manually oriented for analysis, making it possible to acquire highly enhanced spectra more easily [26] . However, in view of the nanoscale dimension of the viral particle, the use of nanoparticles is inconsistent in the reproducibility of spectral enhancement. As a solution to this inconsistency, a specific marker such as made by [27] can be used, where a two-step protocol with cationic gold particles followed by silver intensification to generate silver nanoparticles on the cell surface was used with SERS of endothelial cell membrane, facilitating the collection of enhanced spectra. This methodology generates a 100-fold increase of the SERS spectral signal [27] . Thus, one way of indirectly identifying the presence of a specific virus would be to detect the presence of antibodies induced by the virus tagged with nanoparticles through SERS signals.",

These characteristics make NIR spectroscopy a reliable and non-invasive approach with potential for rapid diagnosis of viral diseases and infections. When working with NIR spectroscopy in the investigation of biological samples, the most useful region is between 650 and 1000 nm (called the \"optical window\"), because there is great absorption of hemoglobin and water below 650 nm and above 1000 nm, respectively, hindering other signals in these regions.

The molecule persists at this vibronic level for a period of time known as the fluorescence lifetime, and then returns to the fundamental electronic state by emitting a photon with energy lower than the irradiated one [37] .

This technique is used to reduce the dimensionality of the sample's data and generate a new visualization. Dimensionality reduction occurs through a linear transformation of the original variables, generating orthogonal variables called principal components (PC). The first main component has a greater ability to explain the observed variance in the data than the second PC, which in turn has a greater explanation of the data than the third PC, and so on. In this way, it is possible to choose the smallest number of principal components with the largest explained variance, so that the dimensionality can be reduced with the certainty that important information of the samples is not lost [23] . Generally, few PC's (10e20) provide more than 99% of the observed variance of the original data [47] . Each PC is composed by a score (projections of the samples on the PC direction) and a loading (angle cosines of the variables projected on the PC direction) [48, 49] . PCA allows visualization of the data set in reduced size where segregation between classes can be revealed (Fig. 4 ) [47] .",

For this, a median score is calculated for each of the 3 PCs that represent the best samples' clustering in a tridimensional space; thereafter, the three loadings vectors for these PCs weighted by the median scores are summed.

As can be seen, a total of 15 out of 17 healthy samples were classified as healthy (88% specificity), and a total of 11 out of 12 contaminated samples were classified as actually being contaminated with hepatitis C (92% sensitivity) [7] . Shanmukh et al. (2008) [18] in their study to identify and classify respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) also used PCA technique combined with Raman spectroscopy. In this study, Raman spectra of A/Long, B1, A2 strains and the recombinant A2 G gene deletion mutant (DG) strain of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were recorded. Based on the intrinsic spectra for each sample, the 3 virus strains were detected and identified. Chemometric results showed that PCA was able to segregate the 3 virus strains (A/Long, B1and A2), as can be seen in the scores plot of PC1 versus PC2 (Fig. 5) , demonstrating the potential of this technique [18] . Fan et al. (2010) [51] used Raman spectroscopy to detect and discriminate 7 food and water viruses (including norovirus, adenovirus, parvovirus, rotavirus, coronavirus, paramyxovirus and herpes virus). PCA was conducted based on the Raman spectra of 4 non-enveloped virus samples (including norovirus strain e MNV4, simian rotavirus strain e SA11, adenovirus strain e MAD and parvovirus strain e MVM). As can be observed in Fig. 6 , the twodimensional plot of the scores on the two first PCs (PC1 versus [8] analyzed near-infrared spectra using molecular clones of various HIV-1 subtypes. The spectra obtained were subjected to PCA to extract information and exploratory analysis, where it was observed that the presence of HIV-1 in the medium altered wavelength absorption at around 950 and 1030 nm, suggesting that HIV-1 changes the vibrations of OH in water [8] . In addition, absorption variations related to different subtypes have been observed, suggesting that different subtypes directly interact with the medium [8] . Still in 2012, Sakudo et al. [52] performed a study with the objective of discriminating nasal fluid samples from patients infected with influenza virus through Vis-NIR spectroscopy. Samples from 33 healthy and 34 influenza patients were used. The results of the PCA scores (Fig. 7) using the two-dimensional plot of the scores on PC1 versus PC2 shown good segregation between the two classes [52] . Moor et al. (2013) [53] analyzed control (uninfected) cell samples, cells after 24 h of adenovirus infection, and cells after 7 days of adenovirus infection by Raman spectroscopy. When submitted to PCA, the Raman spectra of the three-class samples showed results suggesting that the infection induces rapid (24 h) production of a specific protein in the cells, which can differentiate infected samples from uninfected ones [53] . In 2014, Moor et al. [14] continued their work on the power of Raman spectroscopy as a tool for detecting virus-infected cells, and developed a study where they successfully detected embryonic kidney cells of 293 adenovirusinfected humans at 12, 24 and 48 h after infection onset. The PCA score plot was effective in discriminating the spectra and segregating the uninfected cell classes of the infected cells after 12 h (Fig. 8a), 24 h (Fig. 8b) and 48 h (Fig. 8c) [14] . [54] performed a study of the diagnosis of malaria-infected cells based on synchrotron Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) imaging. The images were extracted and preprocessed by second derivative and normalization. The application of PCA to spectral data showed the potential of the technique to identify and discriminate uncontaminated from contaminated samples [54] . Salman et al. (2014) [25] evaluated the potential of Raman spectroscopy as a sensitive, reliable and rapid method for detecting and identifying viral infection by Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in cell culture. The spectral data were submitted to PCA, where a good segregation tendency was observed between the infected and non-infected classes (Vero-HSV-1), mainly when the region of 600e1726 cm \u00c01 (Fig. 9a ) and 1195e1726 cm \u00c01 (Fig. 9b) are analyzed [25] .",

These techniques are exploratory, therefore they group the samples based on their similarity between spectra. CA techniques include k-means clustering (KMC), fuzzy c-means cluster analysis (FCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) [34, 55] . HCA (using Ward method [56] ) is considered the most capable of correlating spectral data with histopathology, but is more time-consuming [34] . Another difference between these techniques is that HCA does not require making assumptions about the number of data classes, whereas KMC and FCA require this information. HCA starts with separate clusters, and merges the clusters that have the closest distance from each other (usually based on Euclidian distance) in each step, so there is a reduced number of clusters in each step until only one remains [34, 55] .",

However, it makes use of the respective object labels for this decomposition, thus being a supervised technique [23] . For discriminatory purpose, partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) is employed. PLS-DA is a linear classification technique for which the classification criterion is obtained by PLS analysis [46] .

The cells were infected with different virus concentrations, and after 1e12 h of postinfection (h.p.i), PLS was used to analyze spectra from different infection trites. The results of this study showed that the detection and quantification of poliovirus through ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, PLS and cell culture is a methodology that could be adapted for use in areas such as water safety monitoring and clinical diagnosis [58] . Petisco et al. (2011) [59] also implemented PLS in the field of virology. They developed a rapid method based on near infrared spectroscopy to detect viral RNA present in Epichlo\u20ac e festucae strains isolated from Festuca rubra plants. Forty two samples were used as the data set, where a correct classification of 75% of the uninfected isolates and 86% of the infected isolates were obtained using PLS-DA, demonstrating that this technique is also promising for detecting viral infections in fungus samples, being a faster and a more cost-saving alternative than the conventional analyzes of reference [59] . Wang et al. (2014) [21] used NMR spectroscopy in conjunction with multivariate analysis algorithms such as PLS to characterize the metabolic profile of Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH) and to identify biomarkers with diagnostic potential for AIH. The results were encouraging and also demonstrate the potential of the technique [21] .",

Additionally, linear discriminant analysis has its operation enhanced when associated with other dimensionality reduction algorithms. For example, LDA is often combined with PCA or PLS in many virology studies [21, 25, 58, 59, 61 ]. An illustrative result obtained when performing LDA is the scores shown in Fig. 10 . It is possible to do some interpretations on the studied data, such as the number of classes (groups), which class has the lowest intra-class variance, and which class has the largest intra-class variance [22] .",

Each chromosome is assigned an aptitude through a mathematical function called fitness function, where chromosomes with the highest fitness value are copied and the chromosomes with the lowest fitness value are eliminated in a step called the selection step. After the selection step, genetic operators are probabilistically applied. The mutation operator makes a variable that is selected to be unselected or viceversa, and the crossover operator crosses the chromosomes.
