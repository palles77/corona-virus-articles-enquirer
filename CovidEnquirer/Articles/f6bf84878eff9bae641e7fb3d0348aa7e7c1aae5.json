We selected 114 candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 12 antiviral genes using an LD tagSNP selection approach and genotyped them in a cohort of 738 school children immunized with two doses of rubella vaccine. Associations between SNPs/haplotypes and rubella virus-specific immune measures were assessed using linear regression methodologies. We identified 23 significant associations (p \u03fd 0.05) between polymorphisms within the 2=-5=-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) gene cluster, and rubella virus-specific IL-2, IL-10, IL-6 secretion, and antibody levels. The minor allele variants of three OAS1 SNPs (rs3741981/Ser162Gly, rs1051042/Thr361Arg, rs2660), located in a linkage disequilibrium block of functional importance, were significantly associated with an increase in rubella virus-specific IL-2/T h 1 response (p \u0545 0.024). Seven OAS1 and OAS3 promoter/regulatory SNPs were similarly associated with IL-2 secretion. Importantly, two SNPs (rs3741981 and rs10774670) independently crossregulated rubella virus-specific IL-10 secretion levels (p \u0545 0.031). Furthermore, both global tests and individual haplotype analyses revealed significant associations between OAS1 haplotypes and rubella virusspecific cytokine secretion. Our results suggest that innate immunity and OAS genetic variations are likely involved in modulating the magnitude and quality of the adaptive immune responses to live attenuated rubella vaccine. \u1b67",

The biologic effects of IFNs are determined primarily by a set of transcriptionally activated IFN-stimulated genes (ISG). A repertoire of antiviral factors and pathways, such as dsRNAactivated protein kinase R (PKR also known as EIF2\u2423K2), the 2=-5=oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) \u03ea ribonuclease L (RNaseL) pathway, Mx protein GTPases, adenosine deaminase, RNA-specific 1 (ADAR1), the ISG15 ubiquitin-like pathway, 3=-5= exonuclease ISG20, and others, play an important role in the outcome of viral infection [7] [8] [9] [10] . The direct importance of these antiviral effectors in humans is supported by earlier genetic studies showing that polymorphisms in the MxA, OAS1, OASL, and PKR genes correlate with response to IFN therapy and/or susceptibility to hepatitic C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), measles virus, West Nile virus (WNV), and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-coV) [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .",

SNPs within the 12 candidate genes, 10 kb upstream and downstream for each gene, were selected based on the linkage disequilibrium (LD) tagSNP selection algorithm [22] from the Hapmap phase II (http://www.hapmap.org), Seattle SNPs (http://pga.mbt.washington.edu/), and NIEHS SNPs (http://egp.gs. washington.edu/). We applied the ldSelect program [22] on each gene for each genotype source for the Caucasian samples in those public sources, to bin SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) \u05460.05, a pairwise LD threshold of r 2 \u0546 0.90, and successful Illumina predictive genotyping scores. We then used the SNPPicker program to postprocess and refine the selection of computed tagSNPs to accommodate a set of platform-dependent design constraints. In addition, a list of putative functional \"obligate\" SNPs (coding: nonsynonymous, synonymous, 5= or 3= untranslated regions) with a MAF \u05460.05 was provided to SNPPicker to choose in preference to other tagSNPs or add to the final list. A total of 114 SNPs were selected on the basis of this approach. The nomenclature used for the description of the variants follows that described by den Dunnen and Antonarakis [23] .",

Four of the five identified significant SNP associations were also within genes of the OAS/RNase L pathway ( Table 4 ). The heterozygous and homozygous minor allele genotypes of OAS1 SNP (rs3741981, Ser162Gly) were significantly associated with a decrease of rubella-specific IL-10 levels (p \u03ed 0.031) and an increase in IL-2 levels (p \u03ed 0.024) (Tables 3 and 4 ). Two SNPs within the promoter region of the OAS1 gene (rs10774670 and rs2240193) were associated with variations in rubella virus-specific IL-10 levels. The OAS1 promoter SNP rs10774670 demonstrated the most significant associations, both with IL-2/T h 1 (p \u03ed 0.002) and IL-10 (p \u03ed 0.009) secretion. Increased representation of the minor allele of a nonsynonymous SNP in exon 3 of the RNASEL gene (rs627928, Glu541Asp) was associated with an allele dose-related decrease in IL-10 levels (p \u03ed 0.01).",

Among these are rs3741981 in exon 3, rs10774671 in intron 5 (at the splice-accepter site), rs1051042 in exon 6, and rs2660 in the 3= UTR.

The functional SNP is believed to be rs10774671, for which the more common A allele is predicted to ablate the specific splice site resulting in isoforms with lower enzyme activity, whereas the G allele is predicted to allow splicing resulting in the production of the p46 isoform with higher enzyme activity. Heterozygotes were reported to have intermediate OAS activity [27] .

This same polymorphisms is suggested to be functional in a genetic study of type 1 diabetes [32] . In this respect, it is worth noting that the only viral infection proven to cause type 1 diabetes in humans is congenital rubella. In our study, the OAS1 Ser/Gly candidate functional polymorphism cross-regulated rubella virus-specific T h 1/IL-2 and IL-10 secretion Fig. 1 . Haplotype block structure of the OAS1 gene region in the study cohort. The LD block structure was analyzed using Haploview software, version 3.32. SNPs in the OAS1 region clustered into two blocks of linkage disequilibrium. The location of the splicing variant rs10774671 (boxed; not genotyped but in one bin/tight LD with rs1051042 and rs2660) is shown. The r 2 color scheme is white (r 2 \u03ed 0), shades of gray (0 \u03fd r 2 \u03fd 1), black (r 2 \u03ed 1). levels. IL-2 is a multifunctional T h 1 cytokine with a wide spectrum of effects on the immune system, including immune activation [33] . IL-10, a key immunoregulatory cytokine during infection, is produced by different cell types, mainly antigen-presenting cells and T cells, and plays a critical role in immune regulation inhibiting the activity of T h 1 cells, NK cells, and macrophages [34, 35] . It is biologically plausible to suggest that one or more linked causal polymorphisms in the OAS gene cluster can finely tune the cytokine balance and thereby influence the adaptive immune response to a live viral vaccine. Finally, potentially interesting findings in our study include polymorphisms in the promoter and regulatory regions of OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3 (some in LD), associated with virusspecific IL-2, IL-10, and IL-6 secretion and antibody levels. Because complex trait associations are more likely dependent on several/ multiple genetic variants, it is reasonable to suggest that the ob-served effects in our study may be a result of several functional genetic variants. Accordingly, the global tests and individual haplotypic analyses revealed significant correlations between OAS1 haplotypes and rubella virus-specific cytokine secretion. The most common major allele haplotype GGGCACAGG (which identifies the major allele A of the splicing variant SNP rs10774671), was associated with lower rubella virus-specific IL-2 secretion and higher IL-10 levels, whereas the minor allele haplotype AAAAGGGAA (which identifies the G allele of SNP rs10774671), was significantly associated with higher IL-2 secretion. Thus, haplotype analyses provide additional evidence that OAS gene polymorphisms might be involved in the mechanisms underlying immune response heterogeneity to rubella vaccine. Consistent with the known OAS antiviral effector pathway are the observed associations for C/A nonsynonymous polymorphism within the protein kinase domain of the ASEL gene (rs627928). Although this genetic variant was shown to produce similar levels of RNase L activity [36] , the evidence for cross-regulation and an allele dose-related decrease of IL-6 and IL-10 is suggestive of the possible functional importance in cytokine regulation. The major strength of our work is the well-characterized study cohort (primarily Caucasians \u03ea91%, which is representative of U.S.A. white population) with documented MMR vaccine coverage and no known wild type rubella viruses circulating in the community. Additional analyses of phenotype/genotype SNP associations in Caucasians only revealed similar results as those presented for the whole study cohort. Another benefit is that the LD tagSNP selection approach we used [22] selects a maximally informative set of SNPs for analyses using LD, which allowed us to infer genotypes/ haplotypes and associations for SNPs of interest (like splicing variant rs10774671, recently implicated in antiviral response [28] ) with a high degree of confidence. The precise quantitative immune profiling of the study subjects allowed us to look for allele doserelated variations as well as cross-regulation patterns for the genetic variants, which increased our confidence in the observed associations. However, we are aware of some limitations to the present study. The results cannot be extrapolated to other ethnic groups given that these primarily concern Caucasians. The issues of multiple testing and possible false-positive associations are also of concern in any study like this. Assuming independent tests of association, we would expect 39 associations to be statistically significant by chance alone (at the p \u03ed 0.05 level), while we observed 48 associations (including intronic), which is suggestive that at least some of the effects are real. We choose the less stringent cutoff value of 0.05 because our study is the first to examine the effect of antiviral gene polymorphisms on vaccine-induced immunity and we believe that the risk of false negatives outweighs that of false positives. As with any statistical association, the study needs to be replicated in an independent cohort to validate the findings, which we are planning. Another legitimate concern is that some of the observed differences in immune measures associated with different SNP alleles appear moderate and it is difficult to assign biologic or clinical importance to them. Although the effect of a single functional polymorphism (that either alters gene expression or protein structure) on immunity as a complex trait outcome is more likely to be small, there remains doubt over functionality of certain genetic variants. At this point in our understanding of the cytokine network as a highly regulated system, there is still far too much complexity in the interplay between cytokines and other components of immunity, to be able to define or predict the effect of even moderate variations on cell-mediated immunity or humoral immunity. Validation studies with increasing sample size or metaanalyses in concert with functional studies are key to resoling questions regarding SNP functionality [37] .",

Our work supports the novel concept that innate immunity is likely involved in controlling initial viral replication for priming and modulating the magnitude and quality of the adaptive immune response to a live attenuated viral vaccine. Both follow-up replication and functional studies are needed to confirm the plausibility of the associations and delineate the mechanisms by which OAS genetic variants influence rubella virus infection and subsequent immune response. Haplotype effects are estimated using the haplotype t-statistic, which reflects the direction and relative magnitude of the estimated haplotypic effect on the cytokine measure. Allele p-values compare individual haplotypes to all other haplotypes combined. Statistically significant p-values (p \u03fd 0.05) are highlighted in bold.",
