            "text": "A novel two-step, SYBR Green I based real-time RT-PCR assay was developed for detection and quantification of BCoV using ABI PRISM 7500 sequence detection system. The assay was carried out using two sets of primers designed to amplify highly conserved sequences of the nucleocapsid gene of BCoV and the internal control, bovine glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, RNA. Specific identification of both targets was elucidated by melt curve analysis, in which the BCoV amplified product generated a melt peak at 78.35 AE 0.26 C and the internal control RNA at 82.54 AE 0.32 C. The assay was highly specific since all negative controls and other viruses of clinical and structural relevance failed to develop any positive results. The detection limit of the reaction was 10 3 plasmid copies and 1.17 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 TCID 50 of the tissue culture propagated virus. Standard deviation and coefficient of variation was low for both intra-assay and inter-assay variability. The assay performance on field samples was evaluated on 103 (68 fecal and 35 nasal) swab specimens and compared with the conventional RT-PCR assay. The results of both assays matched for the diagnosis of 65 fecal and 33 nasal samples. However, three fecal and two nasal samples tested negative in gel-based assay were positive for the real-time RT-PCR. The robustness and a high-throughput performance of the developed assay make it a powerful tool in diagnostic applications and in BCoV research.",

Compared to conventional gel-based PCR assays, real-time PCR has many advantages including rapidity, higher sensitivity, specificity and throughput, lower hand-on-time, minimal contamination rate, quantitative measurement, automation, and easy standardization [11] . All real-time amplification methods depend on the detection and quantification of a fluorescent reporter molecule whose signal increases in proportion to the generated amplicon. The simplest and most cost-effective method involves the use of DNA intercalating dye such as SYBR Green I as a fluorescent reporter. However, the major disadvantage is that the dye molecules may bind to any double stranded DNA in the reaction including non-specific products and primer-dimmers, which requires melt curve analysis to control the specificity of the reaction [12] . A single report described the use of SYBR Green I for detection of 32 animal coronaviruses including BCoV using degenerate primers [13] . This test could be used only for detection of new, uncharacterized coronaviruses rather than for specific identification of BCoV.",

Therefore, a wide range of published sequences of BCoV N gene were aligned together and against other coronaviruses that belong to the three known antigenic groups. Potential target sequences that were highly conserved in different strains of bovine respiratory and enteric coronaviruses were identified. These sequences, however, share many similarities with some group II coronaviruses that were proposed to originate from BCoV [20e22], a mater that was unavoidable.

Therefore, monitoring PCR inhibitors in the utilized samples is very important to avoid false negative results. One of the most important methods for monitoring PCR inhibitors is the inclusion and/or detection of an internal positive control (IPC) in the test samples [26] . The added advantage of using an IPC is the ability to control and normalize the variable conditions of the assay starting from the efficiency of sample extraction and ending with the real-time amplification/ detection. In the process of developing the present assay, a primer set specific for the house keeping gene \"Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)\" of bovine species was included in the reaction. Specific identification of the IPC product by melt curve analysis revealed a clearly distinguished melt peak of 82.54 AE 0.32 C. Analysis of variance revealed no significant differences in the assay performance between monoplex and duplex reactions in terms of specificity, sensitivity and linearity (data not shown).

            "text": "The diagnostic applicability of the developed assay was established by testing this method on clinical samples and comparing its results with the conventional RT-PCR assay. Out of 34 positive samples by real-time RT-PCR (20 fecal and 14 nasal), five samples (three fecal and two nasal) were diagnosed negative by the gelbased assay. As expected, these samples contained the least virus copy number among all positive samples. On the other hand, all the negative samples identified by the real-time assay were also negative by the conventional method. This confirms the higher sensitivity of the developed assay and its reliability for generation of an appropriate epidemiological data. Moreover, the assay proved its ability to detect BCoV over a wide dynamic range (5.5 logs of magnitude for nasal samples and 4 logs for fecal samples). The limited dynamic range of fecal samples as compared to the nasal samples may be explained by the higher background of inhibitory substances in fecal material.",

However, none of these systems utilized the SYBR Green I chemistry for specific detection and quantification of BCoV. The main advantages of SYBR Green I over other real-time PCR detection formats are; a) it is a low-cost fluorochrome, b) it is a simpler approach especially for primer design and optimization procedures [31] , and c) the artifacts commonly observed in specific probes, particularly at amplification cycles beyond the 30th, are minimal and can be ruled out by melt curve analysis [32] .",

In addition, the rapid results obtained by this method are crucial for proper herd management and prevention of disease spread. Moreover, this assay can be considered as a suitable alternative for the regular methods used for studying BCoV pathogenesis and vaccine trials.",
