Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae have been the most commonly identified organisms, although their incidence depends on the type of diagnostic testing and criteria used (Table 1) . Legionella spp and variable infections are also common. Infections by gram-negative bacilli may be increasing in outpatient settings because of the complexity of the clients treated outside of health care settings. 6 ",

Initial diagnosis and treatment decisions are based on assessment of severity. Site-of-care decisions and outpatient treatment versus hospitalization should be based on severity-of-illness scores, such as the CURB-65 criteria (confusion, uremia, respiratory rate, low blood pressure, age 65 years or older), or prognostic models, such as the Pneumonia Severity Index.These objective measures of severity should be supplemented by subjective factors, such as the ability to take medications safely and reliably. Clients with septic shock should be directly admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for vasopressors, intubation, and mechanical ventilation. In addition, any clients with three or more of the minor criteria for severe CAP (Table 2) should also be considered for admission to the ICU or high-level monitoring unit.",

Chest radiographs may also be useful in identification of causative agent, prognosis, alternative diagnoses, and associated conditions. In cases when the chest X-ray is not definitive, although the client's toxic condition is suggestive of pneumonia, it may be prudent to treat presumptively for 24 hours and repeat the imaging in 1 to 2 days. It is important to keep in mind that some clients because of age, immune status, and hydration may not present with typical clinical features, radiograph findings, or both.",

            "text": "Routine diagnostic tests (eg, cultures, Gram staining) to identify causative agents are optional in nonhospitalized clients with CAP because studies have shown that that these tests are infrequently done, yet clients do well with empirical antibiotic treatment. Exceptions to this recommendation, such as influenza that can be tested using rapid point-of-care tests, do exist. Specific recommendations for additional diagnostic testing are provided in Table  3 . Suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, community-acquired Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), fungal infections, avian influenza, and disease caused by agents used in bioterrorism should be verified with further diagnostic testing. Moreover, in situations when antibiotic treatment would likely be altered, investigation for specific causative agents should be undertaken, especially when the presence of specific pathogens is suspected based on the clinical presentation.This allows the clinician to narrow or completely alter antibiotic therapy, improving the likelihood of treatment success. Clearly, extensive diagnostic testing should be indicated for critically ill clients, and the guideline provides additional information about the circumstances in which other testing, such as blood cultures, respiratory tract specimen Gram stain and culture, and antigen tests, should be done. The mainstay of pneumonia treatment is antimicrobial therapy.Appropriate antibiotic selection is based on prediction of most likely causative pathogen (Table 1 and  Table 4 ) and antibiotic susceptibility. For most clients in the outpatient setting, antibiotic selection will be empirical until more rapid and accurate diagnostic tests are developed (Table 5) . Other factors to consider in selection include pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, compliance, safety, and cost. Local susceptibility patterns, if available from local or state health departments, should be considered in antibiotic selection.When the specific pathogen(s) is known, antimicrobial therapy should be directed toward that causative agent (Table 6 ). 1 Clients should be treated with antibiotics for at least 5 days, be afebrile for 48 to 72 hours, and have no more than one sign of clinical instability (heart rate \u0545 100 beats/minute, respiratory rate \u0545 24 breaths/minute, systolic blood pressure \u0546 90 mm Hg, arterial oxygen saturation \u0546 90% or partial pressure of oxygen \u0546 60 mm Hg on room air, ability to maintain oral intake, normal mental status). Clients with persistent clinical instability may need to be hospitalized or treated for a longer duration.",

The next step is for individual NPs to evaluate the guideline to (1) decide whether the strengths outweigh the weaknesses and (2) determine whether the guideline is applicable to their setting and clientele. Straus et al 10 recommend addressing the four \"Killer Bs\" as a way to evaluate the appropriateness of the guideline for implementation in various settings. Is the burden of illness, or the number of clients with this disease, too low to warrant use of the guideline? Are the beliefs of the clients served about the type and value of interventions or their potential consequences incompatible with the guideline? Are the opportunity costs associated with guideline implementation a bad bargain? In other words, would the resources of the practice or community be better spent elsewhere? Are the barriers (geographic, organizational, cultural, legally, etc) so high that it is not worth using the guideline? Implementation of the guideline will be Continued from page 640 Diagnosis and Management problematic in some settings (eg, those in which clients have financial barriers). If clients are being treated in the outpatient setting, inexpensive antibiotics (eg, doxycycline) can be selected; however, the need for chest radiography may be problematic. In summary, despite some weaknesses, including the acknowledged weakness that no primary care providers were involved in the development of the guideline, the CAP guideline has many strengths and in general is applicable to many NPs who work in primary care and urgent care settings. NPs are encouraged to review the guideline and determine whether it is relevant to their practice setting and clients.",
