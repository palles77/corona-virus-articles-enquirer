The previous studies on post-mortem SUDI cases employed other microbiological methods (immunohistochemical methods, cell culture, etc.) in addition to histopathological examinations which were more commonly preferred for CMV diagnosis; however any comprehensive studies to detect CMV-DNA with a more precise RT-PCR method could not be identified.

As a result, it is rather useful to demonstrate CMV-DNA by means of molecular techniques in the cases considered to have histopathological CMV infections. 18 Certain in vitro studies were carried out to demonstrate that CMV infections suppress the T-lymphocyte functions and activity of natural killer cells, thereby causing immunosuppression. 3, 19, 20 Since the immune systems of infants infected by CMV are suppressed, infection with another accompanying virus that causes wheezing may also be seen. 21 Doan et al. 22 conducted a study on infants who developed CMV pneumonia, and reported a decrease in the number of CD4-positive T-cells in 69.4% of the infants.",
