One cannot extrapolate from one's knowledge of dog and cat diseases when treating ferrets, because even diseases that may be seen in all three species (e.g., insulinoma, adrenal neoplasia, mast cell tumors) have mark edly different courses and prognoses in ferrets than in dogs or cats. 2. Ferret owners are generally well informed about their pet's condition. More than any other pet owner, the ferret community is well connected, and many ferret owners routinely research the Internet or contact other ferret owners or veterinary consultants before or during the course of treatment. Be honest with your Subcutaneous injections such as vaccines or antibiotics are generally given to scruffed ferrets between the shoulder blades. Ferret skin is considerably tougher than dog or cat skin, and a new disposable needle (25-gauge) should always be used. Fluids can be administered subcuta neously along the ribs and on either side of the thoracic and cranio lumbar spine. Intramuscular injections are generally given into the quad riceps muscle (with care given to protect the sciatic nerve), and the lumbar musculature can be used as necessary. Even healthy ferrets generally do not possess a tremendous amount of muscle mass, and this diminishes in several disease conditions and old age.",

            "text": "ing. Ideally, antibiotics should be chosen as a result of diagnostic testing, rather than employed in an empiric fashion. In cases of suspected bacterial disease, broad-spectrum antibiotics such as amoxicillin (20 to can be administered immediately following diagnostic proce dures until definitive results are available. The use of antibiotics prior to culture and sensitivity of suspected viral lesions could skew results or totally negate efficacy. Additionally, premature use of antibiotics can reduce levels of bacteria below the thresh old needed for visualization of bacteria in cytology preparations or in tissue section. 2. Antibiotics can mask clinical signs. It is not uncommon that the use of antibiotics, even those not specifically warranted for a particular clinical disease, results in a decrease in the severity of clinical signs, yielding a false impression that an individual ani mal is responding appropriately to therapy. The typical clinical picture is that a sick animal is treated empirically with a broad spectrum antibiotic, resulting in an increase in appetite and activ ity and a return to normal body temperature. After several days, a recurrence in clinical signs is seen, and a different broad spectrum antibiotic is employed. In some cases, four and five antibiotics may be tried without success in the span of 2 to 3 weeks before any diagnostic procedures are attempted. 3. Antibiotics may result in clinical signs by themselves. Although broad-spectrum antibiotics are generally well tolerated by ferrets and do not result in life-threatening alterations of intestinal flora (as can be seen in rodents and rabbits), occasionally antibiotic usage can result in development of clinical signs. For example, approximately 5% to 10% of animals receiving amoxicillin at higher dosages (20 mg/ lb) become inappetent. In this case, reduc ing the dose of 20 mg/ kg or substituting enrofl oxacin at 10 mg/ kg can result in appetite recovery. Other antibiotics, such as metronidazole, can result in clinical signs ranging from inappet ance to nausea, ptyalism, or development of gastric ulcers owing to the stress of administration. The prudent practitioner ensures that antibiotics are warranted and specific for a disease or agent prior to their employment. 4. Be specific in the use of antibiotics. Over the years, the author has seen a number of antibiotics employed as broad-spectrum antibiotics, often as a result of impatience with clinical progress or a lack of proper diagnostic testing. One of the most commonly misused antibiotics is chloramphenicol, a drug that is efficacious in only one ferret disease, proliferative colitis (the result of Ileo bacter infection). A well-stocked pharmacy is no substitute for knowledge of ferret diseases or the judicious use of culture and sensitivity.",

Nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity of the aminoglycosides in domes tic animals has been well documented\u2022; the same is true for the domestic ferret. Ferrets appear to be exquisitely sensitive to the nephrotoxic effects of gentamicin; the use of even published therapeutic dosages in this species can result in acute tubular necrosis and death. Some authors suggest that minimization of renal toxicity and neuromuscular blockade could be seen as a result of division of the total daily dose into three smaller doses given over 8 hours and dilution of the antibiotic with saline (4 mL/kg) and slow infusion over 20 minutes, followed by serial evaluation of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine values. 22 The author recommends the use of this antibiotic only as a last resort follow ing positive identification of an organism that is sensitive to this antibi otic and no other. Amikacin appears to be a better choice for gram negative organisms that are sensitive to aminoglycosides. 3 Additionally, use of other aminoglycosides or cephalosporins in concert with amino glycoside antibiotics can potentiate the toxicity of this group of antibiot ics, and concurrent use with loop diuretics such as furosemide can potentiate ototoxicity (Table 1) .",

Owing to their small size, ferrets can be masked down easily; fractious patients can be placed in an induction cage. Inhalant anesthesia by mask is excellent for short procedures, including phlebotomy, and can be used even in some instances for somewhat longer procedures, such as castration or removal of skin tumors. Ferrets undergoing intra-abdominal surgery or extended or mul tiple surgical procedures should be intubated and maintained using a nomebreathing system. Intubation should be performed only on ferrets that have been masked down; this can be facilitated by local application of 0.05% lidocaine to the larynx with a cotton swab.

Reported side effects include dose-dependent cardiopulmonary depression in a small number of cases. 6 Halothane and methoxyfluorane can also be used in ferrets, but a higher rate of compound-specific side effects (hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, respectively, and dose-dependent cardiopulmonary de pression with both) should be expected. Additionally, both isoflurane and halothane anesthesia result in a number of changes in the complete blood count in ferrets, decreasing hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, red blood cell count, and plasma protein levels. 10 Traditionally, injectable anesthetics have been associated with sev eral problems in ferrets, such as prolonged induction and recovery, a need for premedications (e.g., atropine) and occasionally, unexpected death. Ketamine, often used in combination with other drugs, such as valium or acepromazine, to provide analgesia and muscle relaxation is probably the agent most commonly used but can result in prolonged recovery or seizure activity. Newer injectable anesthetics, such as meto midine (Dormitor, Pfizer Corp., New York, NY) and tiletamine / zola zepam (Telazol, Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA) are gaining It is hoped that the emergence of newer injectable anesthetics with a higher margin of safety will diminish the use of the older injectable anesthetics (e.g., xylazine and barbiturates) that characteristically pro duce dose-dependent effects such as prolonged recovery, cardiorespira tory depression, and marked difficulties in regulating the depth of anes thesia. When compared with newer injectables, xylazine, which in healthy patients can result in heart block, hypoxemia, and unexpected death, is a poor choice even when used with other anesthetics. Barbitu rates, which have long been used in ferrets in research settings, have a known history of drug interactions and prolonged recoveries, and also should probably be avoided in this species.",

Empiric fluid therapy is often of benefit in ferrets with history of vague GI signs or a complaint of recent lethargy and can restore the ferret activity and attitude for a period. The normal daily intake of water for maintenance is approximately 75 to 100 mL/kg/ day for adult ferrets; ferrets pre senting in shock or those with profound losses from vomiting or diarrhea can require doses of up to 180 to 240 mL/kg over a 24-hour period.",

Treatment for heartworm disease in ferrets is simi lar to that in dogs, with thiacetarsamide at 2.2 mg/ kg IV by cephalic catheter b.i.d. for 2 days. Immiticide (melarsomine dihydrochloride) can be used instead of thiacetarsemide but is associated with a lower sur vival rate. Additionally, antithrombotic therapy is recommended in all treated ferrets, starting with heparin at 100 U SC s.i.d. for 21 days, ,vhich is followed by 22 mg/ kg aspirin s.i.d. PO for 3 months. Oral prednisone given at 1 mg daily may also be of benefit. 8 ",

The use of prednisone in the treatment of insulinoma deserve special mention. Prednisone's glucogenic actions are widely used fo short-term elevation of blood glucose levels in hypoglycemic ferre however, the actions of prednisone become progressively less effectiv over time at higher and higher doses. Practitioners are strongly urged t, consider pancreatic nodulectomy or partial pancreatectomy and reserv prednisone therapy for postsurgical or nonsurgical candidates. 25 Di azoxide (Proglycem, Baker Norton Pharmaceuticals, Miami FL) is ocec sionally used as an adjunct to prednisone in the control of hy poglycemi, Diazoxide is a benzothiadiazine derivative that works bv inhibitin insulin release from the pancreas. In most cases, the effects of diazoxid are slight, and because of the expense of this medication, it might nc be cost effective. Occasionally, severely hy poglycemic ferrets can suffe seizure activity at presentation. Intravenous or intramuscular injection of diazepam should control seizure activity long enough for administrc tion of dextrose-containing fluids to restore blood glucose levels t normal levels.",

Bilater ally symmetrical alopecia, vulvar swelling in spayed females, and a return to intact reproductive behavior are common signs of AAE; less commonly, prostatic disease, dysuria, and even pancytopenia are seen.

For several years, mitotane (o,p'-DDD, Ly sodren, Bristol Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ), an adrenocorticolytic agent, has been used in ferrets with AAE; however, results have been largely unsatisfactory. Drawbacks of mitotane use in affected ferrets include (1) nonselec tiveness for the estrogen-secreting cells of the adrenal cortex, (2) high required dose to elicit a clinical response, and (3) a wide variability in individual response to the drug.",

            "text": "SUPPLEMENTSComments should encourage owners to take an active role in nursing as early in the treatment cycle as possible.As compared with dogs and cats, ferrets generally do not have significant parasite problems.Owing  to the nature of ferret farming in the United States, as well as their primarily indoor pet role, endopara sites are rarely seen in adult ferrets. Pet store kits are most likely to have endoparasites, which generally take the form of asymptomatic protozoa! infections. Nematode infections of the gastrointestinal tract are quite rare in this country. For this reason, a fecal examination should be part of the annual or semiannual examination of all ferrets, but empiric endoparasite treatment is neither recommended nor necessary. Ectoparasites, such as fleas and ear mites, are common in ferrets, however. Flea control treatments that are used in puppies and kittens are generally considered safe for ferrets. The new generation of flea treatments available, including lufeneron (Program, Novartis Animal Health, East Hanover, NJ) fipronil (Frontline Top Spot, Merial Ltd., Athens, GA), and imidocloprid (Advantage, Bayer Animal Health, Shawnee Mission, KS) appears safe in ferrets, although testing has not been performed in this species. Dosages for these products approximate those used in small cats. Pyrethrin-based shampoos and dips are gener ally acceptable for ferrets; organophosphate shampoos are best avoided. Ear mites can be treated by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 to 0.4 mg/kg ivermectin (Ivomec, Merial, Ltd., Athens, GA) every 2 weeks or topical instillation of a solution of 0.5 mg/kg divided between the ears. Prac titioners should avoid using both the topical and subcutaneous routes concurrently to decrease the risk of toxicity.14 Rarely, practitioners may encounter skin mites such as Demodex and Sarcoptes scabei in the ferret. These are most often seen in animals that are housed with infected dogs or cats, or in animals immunosuppressed from a concurrent disease such as distemper. Although dosages for older treatments such as lime sulfur or organophosphate dips are available, ivermectin injections, at 0.2 to 0.4 mg/kg subcutaneously every 7 to 14 days, are safer and more effective.14 Antiprotozoal drugs occasionally are required in ferrets. Coccidiosis .s occasionally seen in facility outbreaks; whereas adult infections are 1sually asymptomatic, severe infections in kits can be lethal. Sulfadi nethoxine (Alban, Pfizer, Inc., New York, NY) works well in cases of :occidiosis in ferrets at dosages and protocols commonly used in dogs md cats. Another commonly diagnosed protozoa! infection of ferrets, :specially those housed outdoors, is giardiasis. Although clinical signs ire often not seen with this infection, its zoonotic potential warrants reatment whenever the diagnosis is made. Metronidazole is effective in he treatment of giardiasis in ferrets; however, its bitter taste requires a '.lasking flavor.",
