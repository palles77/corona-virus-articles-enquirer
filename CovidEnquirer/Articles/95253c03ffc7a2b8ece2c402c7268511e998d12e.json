            "text": "The patient with CMT, on the other hand, is symmetric at birth, and the asymmetry develops in the fi rst weeks of life. CMT presents with a tight sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle, causing the child's head to be tilted toward the side of the tight muscle and rotated in the opposite direction. A mass, or fi bromastosis colli, can eventually be palpated within the muscle. The incidence of CMT ranges from 0.3 to 1.9%, but is as high as 3.92% when cases are diagnosed sonographically. 2 CMT occurs more often among boys than girls. 2,3 Some authors report a higher incidence on the right side, 1, 4 whereas others report that it is more frequently encountered on the left. 2 Primiparity, assisted delivery 2,3 and breech presentation 3,5 frequently appear in the birth history. The larger the infant, birth body length and shoulder width, with more associated delivery trauma, the higher the incidence of CMT. 2 Multiple theories to explain the etiology of CMT have been proposed. Van Roonhysen (1670) postulated abnormal uterine pressure as a cause of torticollis. 4 Pommerol, in the 19th century, attributed the unilateral shortening of the SCM to abnormal fetal position. 6 These 'intrauterine' theories have also attempted to explain the presence of several other deformities present at birth. Many authors have commented on aberrant constraint of the infant within the uterus and the association between torticollis, plagiocephaly, bat ears, scoliosis and congenital hip dislocation, [7] [8] [9] [10] or hip dysplasia. 3 Other theories link CMT to birth trauma. The high incidence of breech presentation associated with CMT may document the role of birth trauma in its occurrence. Others suggest that intrauterine torticollis predisposes the infant to breech presentation or forceps delivery. 11 It has been proposed that birth trauma with injury of the SCM and a resultant hematoma, which is then replaced with fi brous tissue, causes CMT. Histologic studies have, however, failed to support this proposition. Proposed compressive arterial occlusion as an etiology 12 has also been dismissed. Vascular compromise does not occur because there is abundant arterial and venous supply to the SCM that follows no regular or segmental pattern and has multiple anastomoses. 13 Among more recent theories, CMT is proposed as the sequela of an intrauterine or perinatal compartment syndrome. 14 A bilateral imbalance of structures responsible for control of head posture may play a role -for example, as may be the case for the interstitial nucleus of Cajal, a neural integrator for head posture. 15 Because the torticollis is not present at birth but appears later, it is possible that it results from improper handling of the child or incorrect positioning as in a car seat. Resultant dysfunction of the occipito-atlanto-axial joints may, therefore, occur and has been proposed as a cause for CMT. 16 Several clinical variants are observed. The SCM mass is not always present. 17 Smaller masses may be found on the occipital bone below the superior nuchal line. When an SCM mass is palpable, usually in the fi rst 2 months of life, it appears well circumscribed within the muscle, is located in the midportion of the SCM and ranges in size from 8 to 15.8 mm on maximal transverse diameter and from 13.7 to 45.8 mm in length (measured with ultrasound). 18 This mass typically disappears during the 1st year of life without any correlation with the resolution of the CMT. 3 Although the fi ndings of head tilt toward the involved side with head rotation toward the opposite side are consistent, the amount of rotation can differ between subjects. Contractures of the semispinalis capitis and the splenius capitis are sometimes present. CMT is probably the consequence of several concomitant factors. The problem may begin with a faulty intrauterine position that weakens the SCM, making it vulnerable to birth trauma and thus creating the dysfunction.",

The medial (or sternal) head has its origin on the upper part of the anterior surface of the manubrium sterni and the lateral (or clavicular) head arises from the anterior surface and superior border of the medial third of the clavicle. Initially, the two heads are separated from one another. They gradually join, below the middle of the neck, to form the body of a thick, rounded muscle. The SCM is inserted into the lateral surface of the mastoid process by a strong tendon and into the lateral half of the superior nuchal line of the occipital bone by a thin aponeurosis.",

The clavicle is more mobile than the sternum and is subject to signifi cant stress during the birth process, which may explain a different strain being put on the two parts of the SCM. A distinction between 'sternal torticollis' and 'clavicular torticollis' has been proposed. 19 The insertion of the SCM covers the occipitomastoid suture; therefore, SCM tightness should be released whenever attempting to treat this suture. Conversely, somatic dysfunction between the temporal and the occipital bones will affect the SCM. The jugular foramen -located at the anterior end of the occipitomastoid suture, between the petrous portion of the temporal bone and the occiput -will also be affected. The jugular foramen contains the inferior petrosal sinus and the sigmoid sinus that unite to form the internal jugular vein. It also contains the glossopharyngeal (CN IX), the vagus (CN X) and the accessory (CN XI) nerves. CN XI provides the motor supply to the SCM, its proprioceptive fi bers passing through branches from the anterior divisions of the second and third cervical nerves to innervate the SCM. Thus, Sutherland stated: 'You will probably fi nd the source of the torticollis to be entrapment neuropathy of the eleventh cranial nerve at the jugular foramen.' 20 Jacquemart and Piedallu, in 1964 , recommended that osteopathic manipulation for CMT be directed at somatic dysfunction of the occiput and upper cervical spine. 16 The mastoid process is not fully developed in the newborn and is totally covered by the tendon of the SCM from its apex to its superior border. The development of the mastoid process is linked to the traction of the SCM; asymmetric sidebending and rotation of the head, as in CMT, will cause the mastoid processes to develop asymmetrically. Cephalometric analysis demonstrates that, left untreated, persistent torticollis can lead to skull and facial asymmetry. 21 When it occurs, the cranial base deformation appears early, the changes being more signifi cant in the posterior cranial fossa, whereas the facial deformity will develop later in childhood. Both the cranial base and facial deformities tend to increase with age. 22 Furthermore, the asymmetric function of the neck muscles stresses the mechanisms of postural control. Abnormal sensory input to the CNS and a sense of instability occurs that has to be compensated for with vision. 23 This can affect the infant's developing visual function. To prevent these sequelae, osteopathic procedures should be employed to address CMT as early as possible.",

The practitioner then pivots to the right and to the left, holding the infant in such a way that, in order to continue to observe their parents, the child must actively turn their head fi rst to the left in response to the practitioner's pivoting right, and then to the right in response to the practitioner's pivoting left.

Because the mass associated with CMT often develops at the conjunction of the two heads of the SCM, in order to release the dysfunction the bones to which the muscle is attached (clavicle, sternum, occiput and temporal bone) should be balanced.

Concern should arise when a rotational dysfunction is present.

Children with NSP present with a higher risk of auditory processing disorders, which is thought to lead to subtle problems of cerebral dysfunction later at school. 55 These problems include language disorders and learning disabilities, as well as attention defi cits. 56 Plagiocephalic children also have a higher incidence of sleep disorders. 36 NSP infants have been described as less active when sleeping on their backs than non-NSP infants, who move actively, turning their head and torso when developmental landmarks are achieved. 56 On the other hand, infants who sleep supine do not need to use their upper trunk and shoulder girdle muscles as much. Consequently, there is a delay in acquisition of early motor milestones. 57 Tripod sitting, creeping and crawling are particularly delayed, which contributes further to weakening of the core muscles. Scoliosis has been associated with plagiocephaly where sleeping supine was identifi ed as a causative factor. 51, 58, 59 In The Netherlands, where the supine sleeping position has been encouraged since 1989, approximately 2.4% of 2-3-yearold children have cervical restriction of motion and/or plagiocephaly. 31 Interestingly, the habit of always bottle feeding a child on the same side seems to contribute to the pattern of asymmetric cervical rotation. Alternating right-and left-sided bottle feeding is consequently an imperative for every baby, particularly NSP infants.",

It is proposed that a deficiency of melatonin could disturb equilibrium and postural mechanisms. 71 Neurologic origins have also been proposed as etiologies of scoliosis. Hearing-impaired children who have a high incidence of vestibular dysfunction have signifi cantly less idiopathic scoliosis than children with normal hearing, resulting in the suggestion that idiopathic scoliosis has a neural etiology. 72 A sensory input defi ciency of the spatial orientation system, involving visual and vestibular dysfunction, is believed to cause motor cortex and axial posture control disturbances. 73, 74 Another hypothesis is that developmental disorders in the central nervous system, followed by asymmetry of the spinal rotators and other trunk muscles, results in AIS. A less effi cient postural regulation system with a diminished quality of standing stability has been demonstrated in some scoliotic patients. 75 Developmental disorders have also been considered at the level of the spinal cord. Differences between the growth of the vertebral column and the growth of the spinal cord -'uncoupled neuro-osseous growth' -either with asymmetric nerve root tension or with reduced growth of the cord, are suggested etiologies for scoliosis. 76 More rapid growth of vertebral bodies that occurs through endochondral ossifi cation, as well as slower circumferential growth of the vertebral bodies and pedicles that occurs through membranous ossifi cation, is observed in AIS patients. 77 Furthermore, the length of the vertebral canal is shorter than the length of the vertebral column. This leads to the hypothesis that the thoracic spine is tethered by a tight spinal cord, with a resultant diminution of the kyphosis. This, in turn, results in a displacement of the spinal cord to one side of the vertebral canal with an associated sidebending of the spine and lastly a rotation of the vertebral bodies to allow for their growth while the vertebral canal stays in the midline. 78 The base of the vertebral canal remains at a right angle to the sagittal plane of the patient, in its original position, and does not follow the rotation of the vertebral body. 78 The tension of the core link -the strong dural membranes covering the cord, between the pelvic and cranial bowls 79 -may play a role in this mechanism. The relationships between the different parts of the craniosacral mechanism, therefore, should be considered, and any dysfunction of the dura and/or the vertebral ligaments should be treated.",

If this imbalance appears early in the growth process, it will result in abnormal asymmetric weight-bearing pressures on the vertebrae. A 'dangerous triad' of joint laxity, delayed growth and persistence of asymmetric overloading of the spine has been described in rhythmic gymnasts who develop scolioses. 80 This group shows an incidence of scoliosis of 12%, compared to 1.1% in the general population of the same age group. Pelvic obliquity has also been associated with the 'molded baby syndrome', where intrauterine molding determines a vertebral curve, having a sacral tilt inferiorly on the side of the spinal convexity. Mechanical compressive forces acting on the infant during the prenatal, perinatal and postnatal periods have been proposed as an etiology for scoliosis. More breech presentations have been found among infants developing scoliosis during the fi rst 6 months of life. 58 Plagiocephaly is frequently associated with infantile scoliosis. 58,81-84 A facial and cranial distortion, always on the side of the curve of the scoliosis and linked to the intrauterine position, has been described. 85 McMaster noted that the scoliosis was rarely present at birth and, like plagiocephaly, develops very often within the fi rst months of life. He proposed an explanation for the association between plagiocephaly and scoliosis, as follows. Infants prefer to turn toward their right side when in a supine position. Light but asymmetric pressures from the mattress on the skull as well as on the growing spine can create asymmetries, particularly when applied over a prolonged time or during a critical period of growth. With chronic right rotation of the head, the back of the head will fl atten on the right, allowing growth of the skull on the left. The thorax follows the same pattern, the left side expanding freely backwards with a left rotation of the thoracic vertebrae. 83 Infantile scoliosis is sometimes found in association with imbalance of the occiput or with dysfunction of the SBS. Intraosseous dysfunction of the occiput can produce asymmetry of the occipital condylar parts, resulting in altered balance mechanics in the spine below. The compressive forces applied to the occipital bone at the time of delivery have been described and suggested to be the causes for future compensatory scoliotic curves. 59, 86 Thus, the child may prefer to sidebend their head slightly to one side and, as time goes on, with potential new injuries and therefore more diffi culties for compensation, the adolescent will develop a scoliosis. Ventura et al. state: 'Even small deformities present at, or soon after, birth may get worse in infants whose connective tissues do not have a potential for recovery.' 84 To this we could add one or more of the components described above -the etiology is multifactorial.",

A thorough medical examination should be performed to rule out these disorders. Hemivertebra is the most common anomaly that causes nonidiopathic congenital scoliosis 87 and is sometimes associated with posterior midline cutaneous abnormalities. Neural axis abnormalities have been demonstrated in 21.7% of otherwise asymptomatic patients with infantile scoliosis. 88 Congenital scoliosis is more common in females than in males, occurring in the ratio of 1.27 : 1. 87 Among children with congenital spinal anomalies, 30-60% have other anomalies located most commonly in the genitourinary tract, cardiovascular system, spinal cord or cervical spine. 89 Since the time of Hippocrates, congenital and infantile scolioses have been described as potentially the result of mechanical factors operating during fetal life. 9 These scolioses are more common in males, presenting more often as a left thoracic curve. 83, 85 Some resolve spontaneously, while others progress. Harrenstein in 1930, 90 quoted by Mehta, 91 stated: 'Spontaneous correction does occur without treatment but at the moment it is not possible to distinguish between the two at the time of the diagnosis.' Thus, in order to differentiate between progressive and non-progressive congenital and infantile idiopathic scoliosis, Mehta proposed a method of measurement of the rib-vertebra angle (RVA). 91 In an anteroposterior radiograph, the RVA is 'the angle formed between each side of the apical thoracic vertebra and its corresponding rib'. The RVAs are equal on a normal spine and a gap of 2-4 mm normally separates the head of the rib and the upper corner of the adjacent vertebra. Mehta states that the most progressive infantile scoliosis presents an RVA difference between the two sides equal to or greater than 20\u00b0. When this radiographic measurement is repeated after 3 months, the RVA remains unchanged or increases with a progressive scoliosis, whereas it decreases with a resolving curve. Furthermore, with time, in the anteroposterior radiograph, a progressive scoliosis demonstrates overlap of the rib shadow with the upper corner of the vertebra. The relationship between the rib and the vertebra and the tissue response to any stress during growth periods is of great importance.",

A curve measuring less than 30\u00b0 at skeletal maturity is least likely to progress, whereas curves measuring 30-50\u00b0 may gain another 10-15\u00b0. 65 Thoracic curves deteriorate most, followed by thoracolumbar curves and double curves. 100 Less than 25% of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis resolves without treatment. 101 Orthopedic treatment with a cast or a brace might be indicated to limit the progression of the curve and to employ surgery to correct the scoliosis. Bracing for at least 23 hours per day appears to be optimal for interdicting progression of the curve. 102 Watchful waiting is suggested as an alternative treatment to bracing because bracing does not decrease the incidence of surgery and often results in adverse psychological effects. 103 Manipulative treatment associated with exercise has been shown to stop curve progression in AIS. 104,105 Exercise may be used to effectively reverse the signs and symptoms of scolioses and to prevent progression of spinal curves in children and adults. 106 As scoliosis is a risk factor for the impairment of physical wellbeing and quality of life, treatment is important.",

Proprioception and muscular tone develop with age to maintain adequate sagittal balance. Sagittal spinal curves change as a child grows. 109, 110 The thoracic kyphosis is more pronounced in males, 111 at a mean age of 12.8 years. 112 More often, the exaggerated kyphotic curve is associated with dysfunctional posture. Juvenile and adolescent kyphosis can be the result of poor posture, as a compensatory pattern to an extension dysfunction elsewhere. Anterior displacement of the occipital bone on the superior articular surface of the atlas will project the chin forward, and the ensuing postural compensation will result in an increased thoracic kyphosis.

            "text": "A brachial plexus injury occurs most commonly as a result of a diffi cult birth, fetal malpresentation, 5 shoulder dystocia, macrosomia 6 or assisted vaginal delivery. 7 Fracture of the clavicle(s) or humerus, 8 shoulder dislocation, torticollis, hematomas of the sternocleidomastoid muscle or paralysis of the diaphragm may be associated with injury of the brachial plexus. 5 A commonly believed etiology of brachial plexus injury is excessive traction on the fetal head during birth. In vaginal delivery, during the attempt to deliver the anterior shoulder, the applied downward traction can damage the brachial plexus. This theory, however, is questionable because, in almost half the cases of brachial plexus injury, delivery of the shoulders occurs without diffi culty. Therefore, an in utero, atraumatic theory is also proposed. 8 When asymmetry and diminished movement of the arm are observed on the fetal ultrasound, a vulnerable plexus may be injured without traction during delivery. 9 The brachial plexus is formed by the union of the anterior divisions of the lower four cervical nerves and part of the anterior division of the fi rst thoracic nerve. In addition, the fi fth cervical nerve frequently receives a branch from the fourth cervical, and the fi rst thoracic a branch from the second thoracic. The plexus extends from the inferior aspect of the side of the neck to the axilla. The fi fth and sixth cervical nerves unite to form the upper trunk; the eighth cervical and fi rst thoracic nerves form the lower trunk, while the seventh cervical nerve runs out alone as the middle trunk. These three trunks pass beneath the clavicle and split into the anterior and posterior divisions. The plexus is attached to the fi rst rib and to the coracoid process by the costocoracoid membrane and is subject to any force that disturbs the relationship between the cervical vertebrae, the fi rst thoracic vertebra and ribs, the clavicle and the scapula (Fig. 7.2.1) .",

As you evaluate the patient, visualize the different layers of soft tissue: fascia superfi cialis, cervical fascia, costocoracoid membrane, sternocleidomastoid and scalene muscles. Evaluate and visualize the different bones involved. Listen to the inherent motions in order to defi ne the dysfunctional area. Study the relationship between the shoulder and the vertebral column. For instance, in the case of a Klumpke's palsy, place the pad of the fi ngers of one hand on the spinous processes of C6, C7, T1 and T2, and place the other hand on the ipsilateral shoulder. Listen, and look for dysfunctional motion. One vertebral segment may be more dysfunctional than others. The relationship between the humerus and the shoulder should also be balanced. Treat the dysfunctions you identify by applying indirect principles. Improvement should be rapid and most cases have a favorable prognosis. Injuries involving the fi fth and sixth cervical nerve roots have the best prognosis, whereas lower plexus and total plexus injuries have a poorer prognosis. Signifi cant defi cit persisting after 3 months should be explored surgically. Prognosis is excellent if antigravity movement of biceps and shoulder abductor is present by 3 months of age.

Increased duration of the second stage of labor, greater than 2 hours, has been described as a factor contributing to shoulder dystocia. 17 Additionally, macrosomia that results in a size discrepancy between the fetal shoulders and the maternal pelvic inlet can, in severe cases, lead to signifi cant neonatal morbidity including asphyxia and trauma, particularly to the brachial plexus. A large fetal trunk, or increased bisacromial diameter, prevents the rotation of the fetal shoulders into the oblique pelvic diameter during delivery. 18 As a consequence, certain obstetrical maneuvers may have to be employed to alleviate the impaction of the fetal shoulders within the maternal pelvis. 19 As stressful as such a disproportionate relationship between the fetus and the maternal pelvis can be, it does not always result in overt trauma to the brachial plexus. It can, however, cause injury to the shoulder that can lead to shoulder dysplasia. This type of injury to the shoulder can occur even from the stresses of an otherwise normal delivery.",

The parents should be encouraged to stimulate abduction of the forefoot, using a toothbrush or similar stimulus, as described above.

It is associated with conditions of the extensor apparatus as unstable patellofemoral joints and Osgood-Schlatter disease. 45, 46 Examination of rotation of the tibia is best done with the child in the prone position with their knee fl exed to 90\u00b0.

Femoral torsion can be internal (femoral anteversion) or external (femoral retroversion) and results in the knees pointing toward or away from each other, respectively. A normal femur is anteverted, i.e. the femoral head and neck are rotated anteriorly with respect to the femoral condyles. Babies have 30\u00b0 of femoral anteversion. This decreases by about 1.5\u00b0 per year to reach 10\u00b0 in adult life. 33 Femoral anteversion is also a very common cause of intoeing in children under 3 years of age, the child being obliged to internally rotate the femurs in order to re-center the femoral heads in the acetabula. Observation of the child's gait allows one to differentiate between intoeing that is the result of internal tibial torsion as compared to femoral anteversion where the patellae are positioned more medially on the knees. The child trips and falls frequently and does not like to sit with their legs crossed, preferring to sit in a 'W' position (Fig. 7.2.8) . Parents note that the child's shoes are very quickly worn out in an asymmetric pattern. Studies in adults in whom the condition remained uncorrected found a correlation between femoral anteversion and arthritis of the knee. 47 Normally, hip range of motion shows greater amplitude in medial rotation than in lateral rotation. Abnormal femoral anteversion can be predicted (\u00b12 SD from the mean) if the difference between medial and lateral rotation is 45\u00b0 or more. 48 The osteopathic practitioner should consider a total body approach and release intraosseous and myofascial tension in the lower limbs. The pelvis should be diagnosed and treated if necessary, as well as the coxofemoral joint. Somatic dysfunction of the innominate, particularly during periods of growth, is signifi cant because of the infl uence it can have on the position of the femur. ",

Moderate loading of the hips at 45\u00b0 of fl exion maintained for 3 hours has been shown to distend the articular capsule and to produce deformation and dislocation of the joint resembling that found in DDH. 55 Modifi cations in the pressure on the cartilaginous acetabulum are thought to interfere with normal bone growth. 56 Uterine constraint is proposed by numerous authors as an explanation for the association between DDH and other deformations. Foot deformity, 57 congenital torticollis, congenital postural scoliosis 56, 58 and plagiocephaly 59 are frequently associated with DDH. The sleeping position of the infant, with a preference to lie on one side (the 'side-lying syndrome'), has also been proposed as a contributing factor to DDH. 60 Leg postures, associating extension and lateral rotation, critically predispose the infant to hip dislocation during fetal life and at birth. Interestingly, the newborn psoas muscle is totally relaxed in full abduction, fl exion and lateral rotation. This muscle is always a lateral rotator of the hip, but exerts a much greater effect when the femur is abducted. 61 Extending the hip results in a levering action that is potentially critical if associated with other contributing factors such as acetabular or femoral ante-version and dysplasia. 62 Caution should, therefore, be exerted when moving the leg into combined extension and lateral rotation.",

Thus, the number of variables necessary for consideration makes such studies extremely diffi cult. The following have, however, been identifi ed as risk factors for the onset of OM: genetic predisposition, 5,6 low birth weight, 7 male gender, 8 number of siblings, 9 day-care attendance, 10 not being breastfed, 1 use of a pacifi er, 11, 12 season of the year, 10,13 passive exposure to smoking 14 and low socioeconomic status. 15 On the other hand, breastfeeding, even for periods as short as 3 months, has been shown to reduce the incidence of OM in childhood. 16 Anatomic factors should also be considered. The ear, particularly the middle ear, and adjacent structures provide a site where genetic, environmental, nutritional and behavioral factors can interact, resulting in the development of OM. The three parts of the ear -external, middle and internal ( Fig. 7. 3.1) -are related anatomically and functionally to the temporal bone. The external ear consists of the auricle (pinna) and external acoustic meatus. The auricle on the lateral aspect of the head, at the level of the temporal bone, refl ects the global position of the temporal bone. A protruding auricle, for example, are often associated with external rotation of the homolateral temporal bone. The auricle functions to collect sound waves.

The production of gas within the tympanomastoid cavity keeps the internal pressure at the same level, or higher, than atmospheric pressure. 20 Swallowing allows gas to be expelled through the PT into the pharynx. This positive pressure gradient prevents bacteria from entering the tympanomastoid cavity. 20 The depth of the mastoid air cell system has been found to be shorter in children with secretory OM compared with healthy individuals. 21 Decreased mastoid pneumatization has been proposed as a prognostic indicator for chronic infl ammation of the middle ear, as has poor outcome with OM when the mastoid is poorly pneumatized. 22 The mastoid cells connect to the tympanic cavity and through the PT to the nasopharynx. Both mastoid cells and PT are of paramount importance in the normal function of the ear and, consequently, the pathogenesis of OM. The PT connects the middle ear to the nasopharynx, balances pressure between the middle ear and ambient air, clears debris and secretions toward the nasopharynx and also protects the middle ear against nasopharyngeal secretions and noxious agents from the airways. It begins on the anterior wall of the tympanic cavity and extends forward, medially and downward to the nasopharynx posterior to the inferior meatus of the nasal cavity (Figs 7.3.3, 7.3.4). Because of these close relationships between the middle ear and the nasopharynx, OM, frequently described as a complication of rhinitis, may be considered to be a disease of the upper respiratory tract. Descriptive and functional anatomy of the nose and nasopharynx is discussed in 'Rhinitis' and 'Sinusitis' below.",

Alternatively, gas exchange can be diminished when the mucosa thickens and submucosal tissue proliferates due to extended infl ammation. 26 In normal tubal function at rest, the PT is usually collapsed, fulfi lling its protective role against retrograde infection from the nasopharynx. 27 The tensor veli palatini (TVP), the dilatator tubae (DT), the levator veli palatini (LVP) and the salpingopharyngeus muscles are all attached to the PT. The TVP arises from the scaphoid fossa, from the spina angularis of the sphenoid and from the lateral wall of the cartilage of the auditory tube. It then descends verti-cally, becomes tendinous and inserts onto the pterygoid hamulus, the lower extremity of the medial pterygoid plate of the sphenoid, and medially onto the posterior border of the hard palate to form part of the palatine aponeurosis. The DT is attached above to the PT, particularly to its membranous portion. It intermingles below with the TVP and rounds the pterygoid hamulus. Most authors agree that contraction of the TVP opens the PT lumen and therefore ventilates the middle ear; 24,28 this action is particularly signifi cant for the fi bers of the DT. 29 The LVP arises from the medial lamina of the cartilaginous PT and from under the apex of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. It extends into the palatine velum, its fi bers broadening to the middle line, where they blend with those of the opposite side. The salpingopharyngeus arises from the inferior part of the PT, is directed downward and blends with the posterior fasciculus of the pharyngopalatinus ( Fig. 7 open it -for example, swallowing, crying or yawning. This balances the pressure gradient between the atmosphere and the tympanic cavity. When the mechanism of swallowing is dysfunctional, opening of the PT is not effi cient. Sustained collapse follows with the development of negative middle ear pressure and retraction of the tympanic membrane. The subsequent potential for aspiration of nasopharyngeal secretions into the middle ear may result in OM. Furthermore, dysfunctional swallowing may also cause gastroesophageal refl ux, another risk factor for OM. In addition, if present, the frequent use of a pacifi er may encourage infantile deglutition, i.e. forward tongue thrust when swallowing.",

PT dysfunction can also affect hearing through its impact on the tensor tympani muscle. The tensor tympani muscle is continuous with the TVP. It arises from the cartilaginous portion of the PT and the adjoining sphenoid, and inserts on the manubrium of the malleus. 24, 29 Tensor tympani contraction draws the malleus medially, increasing tympanic membrane tension while pushing the incus and stapes medially against the fenestra vestibuli.

First, the diverse stimulation produced by normal orofacial functions, such as suckling and swallowing, spurs the growth of structures, particularly the pterygoid processes in which the involved muscles insert. Secondly, but concomitant with the above, the progressive fl exion of the cranial base, associated with the anteroposterior growth of the skull, contributes to positional changes of both the pterygoid processes, which become longer and more vertical, and the petrous portions of the temporal bones, which become externally rotated. Additionally, several changes occur in the viscerocranium, such as the increase in height of the vomer that accompanies the expansion of the nasal cavity. These developmental changes are concomitant with the development of the PT and its associated muscles. Therefore, any structural imbalance that develops in association with the development of the base of the skull or viscerocranium may adversely affect the ventilation and drainage of the ear. A dysfunctional tongue posture may affect the tongue's pumping function on the palatine aponeurosis and, therefore, the associated PT ventilation that occurs during swallowing. Tongue posture adapts to oral development and PT function appears to be diminished in long-faced adenoidal children. 31 Additionally, children with signifi cant overbites are found to be more predisposed to develop PT dysfunction. 32 Body position also seems to infl uence PT opening. Evidence shows a correlation between the lateral recumbent position, where one ear is positioned downwards, and a lower PT opening function on that side. 20 This reinforces the need to avoid the repeated use of the same sleep position for infants.",

            "text": "A dysfunctional PT creates a terrain where other risk factors are reinforced. Recurrent bilateral OM with effusion develops when poor PT function is allied with diminished immune status. 33 The allergic infl ammatory response that often occurs in the nasopharynx also occurs in the middle ear, 34 and the prevalence of allergic rhinitis is signifi cantly higher in children with OM with effusion than in healthy children. 35, 36 The allergic infl ammation in atopic children is not localized in one area only, but manifests itself in the middle ear on both sides, as well as in the nasopharynx, demonstrating totally the united airways concept. 37 Mucosal infl ammation with release of histamine and other mediators following nasopharyngeal exposure to an allergen may, consequently, be responsible for PT obstruction and dysfunction. Chronic allergic infl ammation of the upper airway may lead to lymphoid hypertrophy with increased size of adenoidal and tonsillar tissue. 38 In such a case, with edema and infl ammation of the posterior nasopharynx, the enlarged adenoids may obstruct the pharyngeal ostium of the PT. Tubal tonsil hypertrophy is a possible etiology for OM, when recurrence appears after adenoidectomy. 39 The PT mucociliary apparatus contains components that have an important role in eliminating middle ear debris by moving it toward the nasopharyngeal orifi ce. Additionally, specialized epithelial cells express and secrete surface-active materials that appear to facilitate the muscular action of the PT opening and to protect the middle ear against infections. 3 Conversely, many viruses impair the mucociliary function of the PT epithelium and perturb the nasopharyngeal bacterial fl ora, increasing the adherence of bacteria to the epithelial cells. 40 Bacteria and respiratory viruses (e.g. the respiratory syncytial virus or infl uenza viruses) are common causes of middle ear infection. [40] [41] [42] Because of the connection between the upper and lower airways, the pathophysiologic site of origin is frequently the nasal pathway. Babies born in the fall begin their lives during the peak seasons for viral exposure and the development of respiratory infections, a risk factor for OM. 13 Additionally, impaired or decreased nasal mucociliary activity may also cause PT mucociliary dysfunction. 43 Thus osteopathic procedures that facilitate the clearance of secretions and the mucociliary action of the PT and upper airways are indicated. Blood fl ow to the region should also be improved.",

When an individual is in a setting of 23\u00b0C, the nasal cavities warm the inspired air to 33\u00b0C. 56 The air is also humidifi ed and this allows gas exchange within the alveoli of the lungs that takes place at 37\u00b0C and 100% relative humidity. 57 Therefore, nasal air conditioning requires large amounts of heat and water for conditioning the inspired air and the capacitance vessels seem perfectly designed to fulfi ll that need. They might also operate as a short-term reservoir, either for heat or for water. Special conditions (e.g. hyperventilation) call for these reserves in order to provide cooling and evaporation. 58 Under normal circumstances and normal vasculature, a healthy nose succeeds in warming and humidifying the inspired air in order to protect the lungs. Conversely, paucity in blood supply or moistening may reduce the effi ciency of the air conditioning system of the nasal cavity. 56 The nasal vasculature also contains an extensive system of arteriovenous anastomoses. This allows for the rapid passage of blood through the mucosa without reducing the nasal patency. Great amounts of arterial blood may fl ow through these anastomoses, providing heat exchange similar to hot water in a radiator. 53 Brain cooling appears to be the result of several mechanisms including a possible nasal and paranasal convection process. This latter process involves the transfer of cool venous blood from the respiratory mucosa to venous structures of the brain, such as the superior sagittal sinus between the parietal bones or the cavernous sinuses on each side of the body of the sphenoid, where arterial thermoregulation may then occur. On both sides, the cavernous sinus drains venous blood from the skin of the face and from the nose and mouth areas, and is in intimate contact with the internal carotid artery. 59 The direction of fl ow in these sinuses is reversible. 17 Countercurrent mechanisms are suggested, where the arteriovenous anastomoses, present in the nasal vasculature, may also participate, allowing enhanced thermoregulation and brain cooling in hot conditions. 60 Changes in craniofacial morphology have been observed as adaptations to weather conditions. Wider nasal cavities and larger paranasal sinuses are considered to be adaptive mechanisms that, under hot conditions, offer more evaporating surface and consequently greater cooling capacity, thus protecting the brain. 61 Orofacial dysfunction may alter nasal breathing and consequently the above functions.",

In the reciprocal PRM expiratory phase, the midline structures move in the direction of cranial extension and the paired structures internally rotate. Therefore, in health, the nasal cavities follow each cycle of the PRM, with a resultant widening of the cavities during fl exionexternal rotation of the inspiratory phase and narrowing during extension-internal rotation of the expiratory phase. Cranial somatic dysfunction very frequently follows asymmetric patterns. Thus, the nasal cavity will be wider on one side than on the other. This can be observed by nasoscopic examination, as well as by simply looking at the patient to note asymmetry in the facial features.

The middle meatus is between the middle and inferior conchae. The inferior meatus is the largest of the three. It lies in the space between the inferior concha and the fl oor of the nasal cavity. Only the nasolacrimal duct drains into the inferior meatus in the anterior part of the nasal cavity.",

            "text": "The ethmoidal sinuses, on each side, are formed by 3-15 air cells, fi lling the ethmoidal labyrinth. They are divided into three groups: anterior, middle and posterior. The anterior and middle ethmoidal cells drain into the middle meatus, whereas the posterior ethmoidal cells drain into the superior meatus. The frontal sinuses are the highest. Each frontal sinus develops from an anterior ethmoidal cell that extends posteriorly along the medial part of the orbital roof and laterally above the internal part of the eyebrow at about 5 or 6 years of age. On each side, through the frontonasal duct and the ethmoidal labyrinth, the frontal sinus drains into the middle meatus. The maxillary sinuses are the largest. They form large pyramidal cavities within the bodies of the maxillae and drain into the middle meatus on each side. The sphenoidal sinuses are within the body of the sphenoid, their apertures being on the upper portion of the anterior walls of the sphenoidal body. The sphenoid sinuses drain into the superior meatus, near the roof of the nasal cavities (Figs 7.3.14, 7.3.15). The pneumatization of the paranasal sinuses occurs at different rates, with a great deal of variation between individuals. The maxillary and sphenoidal sinuses are the fi rst ones to develop in the fourth gestational month, followed by the frontal and ethmoid cells that appear in the sixth month. At birth, the parasinuses are quite small. The ethmoid cells measure 2-5 mm in diameter while the maxillary sinuses appear as furrows 7 mm in length and 4 mm in width. 78 The sphenoid sinuses are usually pneumatized around 5 years of age 79 and the frontal sinuses have developed to the extent that they are radiographically apparent by about the age of 6. Around this time, the growth of the cerebral mass slows down. The inner table of the frontal bone is stabilized while the outer table is still dragged forward by nasomaxillary growth. A space forms between both plates, where the frontal sinus expands. Mechanical forces associated with mastication and the actions of growth hormones are linked with the increase in the size of the sinus. 80 Sinusal development normally continues until late adolescence.",

            "text": "Additionally, the paranasal sinuses seem to be an anatomic source for the excretion of nasal nitric oxide (NO). Mammals lacking paranasal sinuses (e.g. baboons) demonstrate lower exhaled concentrations of this molecule. 81 NO is involved in vasodilatation, neural transmission and immunologic activity, and appears also to participate in local host defense, even before allergens reach the respiratory mucosa. It may also regulate the mucociliary motility of the respiratory mucosa, thereby participating in the drainage of nasal secretions and the defense mechanisms of the mucosa. From the paranasal sinuses, NO may also play distal functions. Throughout normal nasal breathing, NO is constantly excreted into the upper airway, acting as an 'aerocrine' messenger. 82 It follows the airfl ow to the lungs where it modulates pulmonary function through regulation of blood fl ow and oxygen uptake. 83 Nasal breathing, therefore, becomes crucial for these vital functions. When compared to oral breathing in healthy individuals, nasal breathing results in an improvement of arterial oxygenation 84 with a reduction of pulmonary vascular resistance. In this manner, NO would be an airborne messenger. It is of prime importance to improve nasal respiration in infants and children as soon as possible. Nasal breathing promotes healthier conditions in association with inspiration. Additionally, it stimulates the development of the maxillofacial skeleton and, therefore, of the nasal cavities. 85 The paranasal sinuses are a common site for infection in children and adolescents. The most common sinusitis is maxillary, followed by ethmoidal and then frontal sinusitis. The tendency to develop sinusitis can be explained in part by anatomy. Proper ventilation is critical for preservation of sinus integrity. The maxillary sinuses are ventilated, but the ostium of each sinus is positioned high on the lateral wall of the nasal cavity. This encumbers gravitational drainage and probably predisposes patients to infections of the maxillary sinus. The frontal sinus is ventilated and because of the location of its ostium at its base, this sinus benefi ts the most from gravity. Sphenoidal sinusitis rarely occurs as an isolated infection, being found more often as a part of complete sinusal involvement.",

Thereafter, it starts to involute until almost completely atrophied by puberty. When the nasopharyngeal tonsil is enlarged it is referred to as adenoid or adenoids; 'tonsils' is usually the common name for the palatine tonsils. Waldeyer's tonsillar ring is located at a strategic point where numerous antigens, both foodsupported and airborne, fi rst come into contact with the body. Thus, it plays an important role in the immune system as a site of antigen recognition and synthesis of antibodies, including IgE. 94 The nasopharyngeal and palatine tonsils are major sources of T lymphocytes that participate in cell-mediated immunity and B lymphocytes that produce immunoglobulins. 95 The nasopharyngeal tonsil also seems to participate in immune peripheral tolerance to harmless foreign antigens commonly inhaled or present in digested nutrients. 96 Bacterial, or less frequently viral, infections are most often responsible for tonsillitis, where the tonsils may be acutely infl amed. Bacterial infections are often streptococcal, usually from group A streptococci, the most virulent species in humans. Differential diagnosis between viral and bacterial infection, based on physical examination alone, is diffi cult. Tonsillitis is characterized by sore throat and pain, particularly during swallowing, which may involve the ears. Headaches, vomiting and high fever may be associated. It should be noted that bacterial infections are correctly treated with appropriate antibiotics and that in these instances the diagnosis and treatment of somatic dysfunction should be considered as adjunctive.",

Increased immune activity results in hypertrophy of Waldeyer's tonsillar ring, in particular at the level of the nasopharyngeal tonsil. Chronic nasal airway obstruction may follow a condition quite common in childhood that leads to a persistent mouth-open posture and mouth breathing. Adenotonsillar hypertrophy has also been associated with a myriad of symptoms such as obstructive sleep disorder syndrome, nocturnal snoring, rhinosinusitis, hyponasal speech and impairment of the ability to smell. 103 Furthermore, hypertrophy of the nasopharyngeal tonsil or adenoids predisposes the individual to recurrent otitis media or otitis media with effusion, in part because of the diminution of the patency of the orifi ces of the PT, located just laterally to the nasopharyngeal tonsil.",

Experiments conducted in primates have established that a persistent mouth-open posture and associated oral respiration leads to dental malocclusions such as cross-bite. 106 Mouth-breather children may present with a narrow, elevated palate and a decreased nasopharyngeal space. In such cases, they may demonstrate a receding chin (retrognathia) with crowding of the maxillary and mandibular teeth, and increased lower anterior vertical face height. Following adenoidectomies and establishment of nasal breathing, changes are reported, with a more anterior growth of the mandible, improvement of retrognathia and diminution of lower anterior vertical face height. 107 The commonly used terminology 'adenoid' facies to describe longer lower face heights, open mouth and more retrognathic mandibles has led people to believe that adenoid hypertrophy was solely responsible for mouth breathing and associated disorders.

Pharyngeal collapsibility is implicated with anatomic predisposition 109 such as changes in the longitudinal tension within the pharyngeal airway. 109 Although adenoidectomy is considered to be an effective treatment for children who are mouth breathers, recurrence of breathing diffi culties in these individuals occurs and has been attributed to their craniofacial anatomic pattern. 110 In upper airway narrowing, sleep apnea, mouth breathing and adenotonsillar hypertrophy, the craniocervical membranous, myofascial, ligamentous and interosseous somatic dysfunction may contribute to the pharyngeal dysfunction. The upper part of the pharynx is attached to the sphenoid, the temporal bones and the occiput. Through the prevertebral fascia the pharynx is linked to the cervical spine and movements of the cervical spine are associated with changes of pharyngeal size: cervical fl exion decreases CLINICAL CONDITIONS oropharyngeal size; cervical extension does the opposite. [111] [112] [113] Any dysfunction of the cervical spine or of any of the structures on which the pharynx is inserted can impair normal pharyngeal function. Movement is necessary to mobilize body fl uids, particularly lymph, and somatic dysfunction affecting the structures surrounding lymph nodes and vessels is associated with impaired motion and can thus interfere with lymph fl ow. Lymphatic vessels from the pharynx drain into the deep cervical lymph nodes through the retropharyngeal, paratracheal and infrahyoid nodes. The retropharyngeal nodes consist of a median and two lateral groups located in front of the lateral masses of the atlas. They are positioned between the pharyngeal and prevertebral fasciae and drain the nasopharynx and PT, as well as the two upper cervical joints.",

Nasal obstruction consists of partial or complete blockage of one or more of these components of the air passages. In the newborn, the posterior nasal aperture may be blocked by choanal atresia. Because of the infant's preferential nasal breathing route, such total nasal obstruction is a medical emergency. 2 In the young infant, and later in life, several other factors can cause nasal airway obstruction. 'Stuffy nose' or rhinitis is a common cause of nasal obstruction in young infants that results in mouth breathing (see p. 224). Viral upper respiratory tract infections, foreign body, deviated nasal septum, hypertrophy of the inferior turbinates and nasal polyps are other factors that can also predispose to mouth breathing and produce an open mouth posture. Nasal endoscopy may be necessary to assess children with severe nasal obstruction that may require surgical repair. 3 Tonsillar hypertrophy is believed by many to be the main cause of nasal obstruction in children. The pharyngeal tonsil, or adenoids, is a large collection of lymphoid tissue located beneath the roof of the nasopharynx, at the level of the SBS. Enlargement of the pharyngeal tonsil commonly occurs as the result of frequent bacterial or viral infections and can obstruct the nasopharyngeal route so that mouth breathing is the only possible alternative. 'Tonsils' is the common name for the palatine tonsils, which are lymphoid tissue located laterally on the oropharyngeal walls, just posterior to the base of the tongue.",

The distance between the occiput and dorsal arch of the fi rst cervical vertebra has been shown to be decreased in mouth breathers. 6 The condyles of the occiput are convex and the superior articular surfaces of the atlas are concave. Extension of the head for the shift from nasal to mouth breathing results in anterior and ascending displacement of the occipital condyles on the superior articular surfaces of the atlas. This causes the horizontal line of sight of the orbits to be angled upward, with resultant shift of the visual fi eld and the need for postural compensation. One way to accomplish this, which is commonly observed in mouth breathers, is to increase the thoracic kyphosis. Another way -possible with young children when the synchondroses of the cranial base are still patent -is to increase the amount of fl exion in the cranial base. Such an increase of cranial base fl exion is present in mouth-breathing children. 7 Interestingly, an increase in cranial base fl exion in primates has been shown to result in a decrease of the anteroposterior length of the nasopharynx and shortening of the anteroposterior length of the mandibular ramus. 8 The decrease of the anteroposterior length of the nasopharynx reinforces the tendency for mouth breathing, while the shortening of the anteroposterior length of the mandibular ramus correlates with the receding of the chin (retrognathia) that is observed in children who are mouth breathers.",

When present, nasal obstruction also disturbs nasopharynx refl exes, mediated through the trigeminal or vagus nerves, which may result in decreased patency of the oropharynx. 25 Multiple sites are considered as potential causes for SDB. In view of the intricate anatomic relationships of the soft palate, the pharyngeal wall, the tongue and the mandible, any dysfunction of one affects the associated structures and their positions. Biomechanical interactions between the tongue and lateral pharyngeal walls have been described 26 and displacement of the mandible also affects oropharyngeal size. 5 Mouth opening reduces oropharyngeal size. 27 The modifi ed mandible position affects the function of the genioglossus, one of the tongue muscles that protrude the anterior part of the tongue out of the mouth. This, in turn, increases upper airway collapsibility, the position of the tongue being a strong determinant of the patency of the oropharynx. This explains why mouth breathers present with snoring and SDB. 7 Alterations in the electromyographic activity of the geniohyoid and genioglossus muscles follow experimental nasal obstruction in monkeys with affected mandibular growth as a result. Similar mechanisms are believed to exist in humans 27 where mouth breathing in children, associated with SDB, may cause developmental facial abnormalities. 25 Maxillary and mandibular protrusions are smaller in children with OSA and the position of the hyoid bone is lower. 28 Mouth breathing generates the development of a craniofacial type that includes an increased value of the anterior facial height and an open bite. 29 The increased respiratory effort that these children must exert is responsible for functional impairment and eventually structural changes in their craniofacial anatomy. OSA is also associated with poor sleep quality, failure to thrive, impaired daytime psychomotor performance, irreversible developmental delay 17 and enuresis. 30 Osteopathic procedures should consequently be employed at the earliest possible time to avoid the establishment of dysfunctional patterns and their sequelae.",

Infections with infl uenza viruses B and coronavirus may also be common. 32 Infl uenza viruses are highly contagious and are responsible for epidemics presenting various degrees of severity, although only a small proportion of children infected with the virus develop severe disease. Risk factors are childcare attendance, exposure to environmental pollutants, school-aged siblings, congenital abnormalities of the airways and neuromuscular disease. 33 RSV is so named because, in tissue culture, it grows as a giant syncytia, a mass of protoplasm containing several nuclei. Multiple genotypes of RSV cocirculate every year, 34 along with an important variability in infl uenza virus occurrence from year to year. 32 The infecting virus fi rst establishes in the upper respiratory tract and then spreads to the medium and small bronchi and bronchioles, resulting in infl ammation of the epithelium with edema and bronchial obstruction that manifests principally during expiration. Air is trapped within the alveoli and hyperinfl ation of the lungs follows. Respiratory distress appears with tachypnea and tachycardia. Expiration is diffi cult and prolonged, and when the infant presents with severe tachypnea, breath is rapid and short, with poor air exchange. Wheezing, crepitus and fever may be present.",

Evaluation of different diets demonstrates the asthma preventive effect of dietary management for children with a family history of asthma. Of demonstrable benefi t are diets with increased anti-infl ammatory 'n-3' polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids), alone 49 and in combination with house dust mite allergen prevention. 50 There is also some evidence that dietary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation during pregnancy and early childhood may potentially reduce infant atopy and asthma. 51, 52 The controversial 'hygiene hypothesis' was developed in the late 1980s to explain the high prevalence of allergic diseases and asthma in industrialized countries. 53 The attention to hygiene in these countries is associated with reductions in microbial exposures and decreased incidence of infectious diseases. Microbial encounters in infancy and early childhood stimulate the development of the immune system and the 'hygiene hypothesis' states that atopic disorders are the consequences of the lack of early life infections. 54 Alternatively, the use of antibiotics in the 1st year of life may increase the risk of asthma. 55 Opposite to the hygiene hypothesis, however, there is evidence that the pathogenesis of asthma may include early exposure to viruses and bacteria. 56, 57 A high frequency of respiratory tract infections in the 1st year of life is a predictor of asthma between the ages of 6 and 8 years. 46, 58 Elevated IgE levels at 6 months are also a predictor. 46 Alternatively, the association of atopy with asthma is controversial and the onset of eczema during the 1st",

The goals of treatment are to encourage expectoration of mucus, reduce the mechanical impact of somatic dysfunction, enhance the recuperative effect of balanced sympathetic and parasympathetic tone, and facilitate the arterial, venous and lymphatic components of tissue perfusion. Because signs and symptoms are often observed fi rst by the parents, these children may present to the osteopathic practitioner before the diagnosis of asthma has been formally made. It must be stressed that asthma is a potentially life-threatening condition, and although the treatment of somatic dysfunction can greatly benefi t the patient, 77,78 the need for other methods of medical management should never be dismissed. The earlier somatic dysfunction is effectively addressed, the better the possible outcome. Manipulative treatment should begin with the area most easily accessible without distressing the child. The sequence of treatment is determined by the patient's acceptance of the intervention. Older children are commonly tolerant and treatment may be begun on the treatment table. For younger children, it is often easier to begin with the evaluation and treatment of the upper thoracic cage because this can be done with the child seated, even in the caregiver's lap.

An external rotation of one temporal bone tends to limit the freedom of expiration. Examine the relationship between the sphenoid, frontal and facial bones. The bones of the face -ethmoid, lacrimal, maxillary and nasal bones, which contribute to the structure of the nasal airway -are suspended beneath the frontal bones. Additionally, the ethmoid bone articulates posteriorly with the sphenoid. It is not uncommon to encounter compression between the frontal bones and the bones of the face. Treat specifi cally identifi ed dysfunctional patterns. It is important that the nasal airway is unobstructed because of the effect of nasal respiration on inspired air and thoracopulmonary function. The interrelationship between rhinosinusitis and asthma further stresses the importance of appropriate function of the facial bones in asthmatic children. Treatment of the cranial mechanism with attention to the inherent rhythm augments the CRI with a resultant total body effect.",

The eyeballs start to develop from neuroectoderm of the lateral aspects of the forebrain as a pair of diverticulae at approximately the 22nd day of gestation. At the 25th day, two optic vesicles are formed. Around the 4th week, they invaginate and create the optic cups in which mesenchymal and vascular tissues enter the globe. The different parts of the future eyeball and surrounding orbital cavity are intimately interrelated. At the beginning of the fetal period -the end of the 2nd month of gestation -EOM are present, surrounding the eyeball. Growth will continue with a signifi cant correlation between gestational age and fetal eye biometry, including lens, orbital diameters, circumferences and surfaces. 6 Surrounding the eyeball, the constituents of the orbital cavity consist of the frontal, lacrimal, palatine and zygomatic bones, ethmoid, maxilla and sphenoid. They develop in membrane and are quite responsive to the growth stimulation of the eyeball. Thus, the orbital cavity is growing as a result of the increase of the volume of the eyeball and the activity of the EOM, with more and more elaborate eye movements. From this time up to 5 years of age, the eyeballs will continue to grow, acting continuously as a growth stimulator for the skeletal cavity of the orbit. At birth, the orbit height is already 55% of its adult height. At 3 years of age it is 79%, while at 7 years of age it is about 94%, nearly its adult size. 7 Evidence of the importance of this stimulating factor is demonstrated by conditions like microphthalmia, where the development of the eyeball does not occur correctly, or when an individual is enucleated in early childhood. Underdevelopment of the orbital cavity is typically associated with these conditions. An anophthalmic bony orbit may be 14.5% smaller when compared to the other orbit. 8 The concept that function affects structure, one of the basic osteopathic principles, is perfectly illustrated in this instance.",

The lateral wall of the orbit is directed medially and forward. It consists of the orbital process of the zygomatic and the orbital surface of the greater wing of the sphenoid. The sphenozygomatic suture unites them. This is another site of particular interest since the zygomatic bone is easily palpable. Through palpation of the zygoma one can visualize, indirectly assess and treat the less accessible greater wing of the sphenoid. The sphenozygomatic suture ends below at the anterior end of the inferior orbital fi ssure. The upper end of the sphenozygomatic suture meets with two other sutures, creating a sutural crossroads for consideration in the treatment of any ocular dysfunction. Anteriorly, the frontozygomatic suture can be observed, and posteriorly the suture between the frontal bone and the greater wing of the sphenoid. Just under the frontozygomatic suture, on the orbital process of the zygomatic bone, is a tubercle for the attachment of the levator palpebrae superioris' aponeurosis.",

This is because the type of attachment they demonstrate to the periorbita -an interlocking of tendinous and muscular fi bers -provides them with a strong anchor. 10 The contraction of the EOM rotates the eyeball according to their insertions and the orientation of their fi bers. However, in all cases it should be remembered that these muscles function together and not as isolated entities. The ocular movements of individual muscles can be simplifi ed as follows: 5 \u2022 The superior and inferior recti adduct the eyeball, in association with elevation and intorsion from the superior rectus and depression and extorsion from the inferior rectus. \u2022 The medial rectus adducts the eyeball while abduction is the result of contraction of the lateral rectus. \u2022 The superior oblique is considered to act from the trochlea. \u2022 Both the superior and inferior oblique abduct the eye, with a component of depression and intorsion from the superior oblique and elevation and extorsion from the inferior oblique. being described in 1806. 13 This capsule is a fascial sheath completely covering the eyeball. It extends from the optic nerve to the corneoscleral junction and separates the eyeball from the orbital fat. It is perforated by the tendons of the EOM on which it refl ects to form tubular sheaths. Tenon described this capsule as a 'muscle pulley'. 13 After much controversy, this theory is again accepted, and further studies have established that each rectus and inferior oblique muscle passes through a pulley formed by a ring or sheath of collagen, elastin and smooth muscle that is located close to the equator of the eyeball, in Tenon's capsule. 14 In this manner, the rectus and the inferior oblique muscles have their paths constrained by pulleys that serve as functional origins for the muscles, in a fashion similar to that of the trochlea for the superior oblique muscle. 15 Thus, the position of a pulley insertion relative to the eyeball affects the forces of the EOM, and a translation of the eyeball of 1.5 mm modifi es the pulling direction of the rectus muscle by 6\u00b0. 16 These pulleys are under active muscular control, allowing for constant ocular adjustments. 14 Conversely, their instability and modifi cation of location are associated with ocular dysfunction. 16 The EOM connective tissue sleeves that act as pulleys are fi rmly attached to each other and, through extensions, to the orbital walls. Those from the lateral and medial rectus are anchored to the orbital tubercle of the zygomatic bone and posterior to the lacrimal crest of the lacrimal bone, respectively. They are referred to as check ligaments. This point is of great signifi cance. The zygomatic bone should not be overshadowed as a site of insertion for the EOM sheaths by the sphenoid on which the common tendinous annulus of Zinn inserts. In subjects with It should be noted that while the longitudinal axis of the orbit deviates laterally in a posterior to anterior direction, the axis of the eyeball approximates the sagittal plane (Fig. 7.5.5) . Therefore, muscular activity between medial and lateral muscles is not equal. At birth, infants tend to demonstrate intermittent ocular misalignments. This is associated with lack of maturity in visual function. It should disappear by 4 months of age when orthotropic ocular alignment and sensory binocularity should be present. 11 Transitory esotropic misalignments are usually considered to be typical in infants. However, if the condition is permanent with a fi xed restriction of any of the EOM movements, or if it persists after 6 months of age, further evaluation is necessary. 12 In any case, osteopathic examination and treatment are indicated to balance the bony components of the orbit and their relationship with other parts of the skull. Dysfunction can also manifest through myofascial and membranous components. Entrapment neuropathy can result. Evaluation and treatment of these components are indicated to promote the best possible muscular activity and ocular function.",

Intraosseous dysfunction in infants between the greater and lesser wings of the sphenoid, or narrowing of the fi ssure because of greater wing dysfunction with surrounding structures, such as the temporal bone, impairs venous drainage or impulse conduction of the nerves passing through the fi ssure. 19 Additionally, lymphatic stases outside the skull can also entrap nerves at their foramina of exit. 19 Multiple theories exist concerning the cause of non-paralytic or concomitant strabismus, including sensorimotor, anatomic and mechanical or muscular origins. 10 Prematurity 20 and diffi cult labor are considered to be risk factors. A supranuclear developmental abnormality in the CNS is thought to be the cause of strabismus occurring in the fi rst 6 months of life. Impaired vision and amblyopia may also cause strabismus.",

The fovea centralis, the center of the macula lutea, is a point of maximum vision and could be considered as the posterior point of the eyeball's axis. It is approximately 3-4 mm lateral and 1 mm inferior to the center of the optic disc, a point where the retina is insensitive to light, referred to as the blind spot. The macula continues to develop until 16-18 weeks after birth. Fully developed visual acuity is normally established by 2 years of age. 22 Light passes through various refracting media in the eye, the aqueous humor, the lens and the vitreous body. The aqueous humor fi lls the anterior and posterior chambers of the eyeball. It is secreted into the posterior chamber by the ciliary processes. It fl ows into the anterior chamber through the pupil and is absorbed into the scleral venous sinus between the iris and cornea.

For these reasons, when examining and treating infants and children, an osteopathic practitioner should pay close attention to any somatic dysfunction that may potentially alter the normal shift of the refractive state of the eye to emmetropia. The sites of dysfunction with potential for alteration of the visual system are the different bony components of the orbit, the eyeball, EOM and surrounding fascial and dural sheaths. Because the vestibulo-ocular refl exes link the individual's posture with ocular function, the axial skeleton and postural balance of the child should also be addressed.",

If the point of focus falls behind the retina, increased accommodation is necessary to bring the point of focus on the retina. This occurs with hyperopia and has been associated with decrease of the axial length of the eyeball. Conversely, in myopia, the point of focus falls in front of the retina and this is associated with increase of the axial length of the eyeball (Fig. 7.5.6 ).

Greater dimensions are present in myopic eyes than in emmetropic eyes when the vitreous chambers are measured along the axial direction, i.e. the optical and visual axes. 31, 32 Heavier newborns with large heads have longer optical axial lengths, deeper vitreous chambers and fl atter corneas. However, refraction is maintained and satisfactory, suggesting the presence of accommodative mechanisms in the cornea that compensate for the longer axial length. 24 Myopia usually develops because of a lack of coordination between postnatal growth and the refractive power of the eyeball components. There is some probability that the CNS infl uences the development of myopia. 28 Unequal curvature(s) along the meridians of the refractive surfaces of the eye -cornea, anterior or posterior surfaces of the lens -result in astigmatism. Thus, when light enters the eye, instead of having the cornea and the crystalline lens focusing the rays of light at a single point on the retina, they are spread out as a line in one direction or another. The orientation of the axis of corneal astigmatism is affected by the mode of delivery. Infants delivered vaginally when compared to those delivered by cesarean section demonstrate a higher frequency of with-the-rule astigmatism, with the greater curvature of that astigmatism tending to be in the vertical meridian. 33 These astigmatic corneas usually fl atten signifi cantly by the age of 6 months.",

            "text": "In infants, the tongue is totally contained in the oral cavity, although it is quite wide in proportion to the container and protrudes beyond the alveolar gum pads. However, its development is far from being complete and its position will go through many changes before the end of adolescence. One of the biggest changes occurs in the fi rst years of life, as the child grows, the posterior third of the tongue descends following the larynx. 1 When evaluating tongue malposition in children, the bony attachments of the tongue muscles should be evaluated for somatic dysfunction. Dysfunction of the mandible, the temporal bones through the styloid processes and the hyoid bone may potentially interfere with the position of the tongue. One of the most common lingual dysfunctions is forward and inferior displacement of the tongue. This predisposes to malocclusion and mouth breathing. Mouth breathing and a low posture of the tongue are also associated with an inferoposterior displacement of the anterior convexity of the hyoid bone. [4] [5] [6] To ensure the lingual mobility necessary in the infant for feeding and the development of proper speech, the frenulum linguae should not be too short. Ankyloglossia, or tongue-tie, is a congenital anomaly characterized by an unusually short frenulum linguae. Breastfeeding is more diffi cult in the presence of ankyloglossia, and children have more diffi culty pronouncing lingual and sibilant sounds such as T, D, Z, S, TH, N and L. 7 Furthermore, the tongue affects the growth and development of the maxillae and mandible and, therefore, the teeth in the alveolar processes, acting as a natural orthodontic appliance 'for better or for worse'. 8 Its position should be unencumbered as early in life as possible in order to play a satisfactory functional role. As such, clipping of the frenulum (frenuloplasty) may be necessary in association with osteopathic procedures to ensure a correct tongue placement.",

During breastfeeding, before the initiation of sucking, the tongue protrudes beyond the lower gum and then retracts, repeating this protrusive and retrusive displacement of the tongue to draw the nipple into the mouth. If the newborn recognizes the odor of the breast's nipple, frequent sucking is initiated that, in turn, will stimulate the mechanism of lactation. The mother's milk odor results in increased sucking and stronger pressure than when the infant is fed formula or water. 10 Successful sucking is produced by a peristaltic wave in the medial portion of the tongue moving from the front to the back of the tongue. 11, 12 This is the result of successive contraction and relaxation of the genioglossus and transverse muscles of the tongue. At the same time, a repetitive thrust of the mandible participates in the compressive action on the nipple to produce milk. Sucking results from the combined actions of the masseters, orbicularis oris and buccinator muscles, as well as from the muscles of the tongue and the mandible, in particular the lateral pterygoid muscles. This activity of the pterygoid muscles is important. At birth the pterygoid processes of the sphenoid are not fully developed, and because the activity of sucking requires a signifi cant effort from the infant, the stimulation produced contributes to their development.",

            "text": "At approximately the 10th month of life, a new sucking pattern appears. It resembles that of later years, as when sucking from a straw, and demonstrates less movement of the tongue. 13 Refl exes are of paramount importance in the actions of the oral cavity. They facilitate various vital functions, including suckling and swallowing, but also breathing, eating and drinking. Sucking elicits a swallowing refl ex in the infant by stimulating the lips and the oral cavity. This refl ex results from sensory input that induces a series of motor responses. It is mediated through neural receptors located on sensory fi bers, the afferent pathway of sensory fi bers, central synaptic connections and interneurons, and the efferent pathway composed of motoneurons or autonomic postganglionic neurons innervating the effector organ. In a somatic refl ex, the effector is the striated muscle innervated by the alpha motoneuron. In an autonomic refl ex, the effector includes a peripheral neuron extending its postganglionic axon to visceral structures. In sucking and swallowing, the sensory receptors -the tongue, gums, palate and pharynx -are located in the oral cavity. The sensory input passes through the superior laryngeal nerve, trigeminal nerve (CN V) and glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) to the brainstem, in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and adjacent reticular formation. From there, second order neurons engage brainstem deglutitive pharyngeal and laryngeal motoneurons in the nucleus ambiguus and in the facial, trigeminal and hypoglossal nuclei. The palate and palatopharyngeal muscles respond, separating the mouth from the nasal cavity to prevent passage of food from the oral cavity to the nasal cavity during the swallowing process. 14 The integrity of the infant's oral cavity is of signifi cance when considering the development of orofacial refl exes. The concept that structure affects function, and vice-versa, is perfectly illustrated in this area. The different structures that constitute the oral cavity evolve as the infant is developing, thus producing changes in function that will, in turn, further affect those structures. Conversely, malposition of any of the structures contributing to the oral cavity, such as lingual malposition, will affect function and consequently viscerocranial development in infants and children.",

This decreases muscular participation and bottle-fed infants demonstrate a reduction of masseter muscle activity. 15 The positive effect of muscular traction on bony development and thus on orofacial development 16 is decreased and may, in turn, contribute to malocclusion. 17 The type of nipple employed during bottle feeding, i.e. its material, density and location of holes, requires different adaptive patterns from the infant. Most of the time, the root of the tongue does not come up to the tip of the nipple, as is the case with breastfeeding, but rather demonstrates a more posterior position.",

            "text": "Sucking is considered to be a determining factor in orofacial morphogenesis. It infl uences mandibular growth through the traction of myofascial attachments. The upper head of the lateral pterygoid muscle inserts into the developing condyle of the mandible. Active sucking as produced by breastfeeding is considered to be of paramount importance in mandibular development. It contributes to the change from the retrognathic mandibular posture seen in infants to a more centered position at 1 year of age. 18, 19 During breastfeeding, the shape of the breast and the sucking pressure of the infant's tongue against their palate has a modeling effect on the palate. The pressure of the tongue on the anterior portion of the palate produces a pattern of cranial fl exion-external rotation. The rhythmic sucking pressure on the infant's palate results in a pumping action that may contribute to the balancing of their skull and cranial mechanism. Additionally, breastfeeding seems to have a positive effect on orofacial morphogenesis, 20 and a protective effect for the development of posterior cross-bite in deciduous dentition. 21 Human milk is a complex fl uid that contains more than 200 components and is highly effective for the health and wellbeing of the infant. 22 Breastfeeding provides multiple benefi ts, such as decreased gastrointestinal and respiratory infections in childhood, 23 in particular otitis media, as well as protection against atopic disease. 24, 25 It also seems to reduce pain in infants 26 and to enhance cognitive and visual development, as well as to have a potentially positive impact on the mother's health. 22 Breastfeeding is thus recommended as the optimal source of nutrition for infants during the fi rst 6 months of life. Although thought of as a natural process, it is not always easy, and some infants demonstrate diffi culties. Such is the case for preterm infants, or infants with developmental anomalies such as micrognathia or ankyloglossia. Nursing diffi culties may also be related to developmental anomalies of the mother's breast or variations of nipple size or shape that reduce the effectiveness of sucking. When developmental anomalies are not present, but nursing diffi culties persist, an evaluation for somatic dysfunction should be performed. The oral structures, including the mandible, should be assessed, and the function of the tongue should be checked. The intrinsic muscles of the tongue are all innervated by the hypoglossal nerve (CN XII), as are all the extrinsic muscles, with the exception of the palatoglossus muscle which is innervated by the vagus nerve (CN X). The hypoglossal nerve leaves the skull through the hypoglossal canal, situated in the anterior intraoccipital synchondrosis, between the basiocciput and the exocciput. The hypoglossal nerve may be subject to compressive forces during a diffi cult labor, with consequent impact on tongue motor function and resultant suckling diffi culties.",

Normally, coordination of the buccopharyngeal functions takes place by 35 weeks postconceptional age, 14 although refl ex swallowing occurs when sucking stimulates the lips and the oral cavity. A spoon of food placed on the tongue of term infants will also produce a refl ex where the tongue pushes against the spoon. 1 It is only around the 4th or 5th month of age that infants open their mouth when a spoon is brought before them or touches their lips, and approximately 2 weeks later that they use their tongue to move food to the back of the mouth to swallow. 27 The mechanism of deglutition is divided into oral, pharyngeal and esophageal stages. The oral stage occurs when the milk or food is in the mouth and when the child tastes, plays, experiments with the food and forms a bolus to be pushed into the pharynx and esophagus. At that time, the anterior part of the tongue presses against the hard palate, while in infants the buccinator muscles participate with resultant suction. Next, the tongue propels the bolus in the back of the mouth into the pharynx and the swallowing refl ex is elicited. Multiple receptors around the opening of the pharynx are stimulated by the bolus, resulting in sensory impulses conducted to the swallowing center via CN V, IX and X. Consequent motor activity is triggered by CN IX and X.",

During immature swallowing, the tongue protrudes over the lower lip with active contraction of the facial muscles, in particular the orbicularis oris and mentalis muscles. With progression of time, the teeth erupt in surroundings that can have an infl uence on their development, as much as they can infl uence the adjacent structures. Therefore, with maturation, the tongue rests lower in the mouth and is located between the teeth. Now, during swallowing, the tip of the tongue is posterior to the incisors, the lips are sealed and facial muscles relaxed. Infantile or immature swallowing should disappear around 2-3 years of age, and the positioning of the tongue against the palate will contribute to the development of a broad palate and a well-developed facies.",

The esophagus is a tube connecting the pharynx and stomach, with muscular sphincters -the upper and lower esophageal sphincters. The upper portion of the esophagus (the cervical esophagus) consists of skeletal muscle; the remainder (the thoracic esophagus) consists of smooth muscle. After swallowing, the bolus of food passes through the pharynx to enter the esophagus. A primary wave of contraction starts in the pharynx and travels along the whole length of the esophagus, reinforced by secondary waves in the body of the esophagus. These peristaltic waves assist gravity to propel the bolus through the esophagus and into the stomach. Normally, at the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ), the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxes to allow the bolus of liquid or food to pass into the stomach.",

The LES is under tonic contraction that relaxes during swallowing as well as following esophageal distension by a bolus of liquid or food. Additionally, the crura of the diaphragm participate in this sphincteric mechanism. The esophagus traverses the diaphragm through an opening in the right diaphragmatic crus, the esophageal hiatus, which is located between the central tendon and the hiatus aorticus. The two vagus nerves (CN X) also traverse the diaphragm through the esophageal hiatus. At this hiatus, one crus, most often the right crus, surrounds the esophagus forming an external sphincter; however, the fi bers from the crus are not directly connected to the esophageal wall. Rather, fi bers coming from the transversalis fascia, and thus continuing to form a fascia under the diaphragm, pass into the esophageal hiatus and surround the esophagus to blend into its walls 2-3 cm above the GEJ. Some of the elastic fi bers of the fascia extend into the esophageal submucosa. 1 This connection between the diaphragm and esophagus is called the phrenoesophageal ligament. This ligament simultaneously allows GEJ mobility, permitting the displacement associated with respiration and swallowing, while providing restriction of upward movement of the esophagus. Additionally, during pulmonary inspiration, the diaphragmatic esophageal hiatus contracts in response to increased intra-abdominal pressure. 1 The fascial relationships between the esophagus and the diaphragm must be balanced when addressing dysfunction of the GEJ. The transversalis fascia is a vast layer of fascia lying between the peritoneum and the abdominal walls, in continuation below with the pelvic fasciae, behind with the thoracolumbar fascia and above with the fascial sheet covering the undersurface of the diaphragm. The phrenoesophageal ligament, described above, consists of fi bers extending from this layer to form the cone surrounding the GEJ. Furthermore, the stomach is connected to the diaphragm through the gastrophrenic ligament, i.e. the portion of the greater omentum that extends from the greater curvature of the stomach to the inferior surface of the diaphragm. From a functional point of view, the diaphragm must be balanced to allow satisfactory GEJ function.",

However, a transient LES relaxation (TLESR) as the result of a vasovagal refl ex appears to be frequently associated with GER, producing a complete relaxation of the LES without pharyngeal swallowing. 39, 40 Other factors for GER include ineffective esophageal motility or delayed gastric emptying. 41 A high fat diet can contribute to an increase in the number of episodes of TLESR. 42 Additionally, in infants, gravitational and positional factors associated with the supine position may exacerbate the refl ux. Most infants spend more time in this recommended position since the 'Back to Sleep' campaign to prevent sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The return of the gastric acid contents into the esophagus predisposes the infant and the child to esophagitis; for these patients, crying becomes common. 43 Acid refl ux into the esophagus can reach the upper esophagus, the pharynx and larynx, and may possibly be aspirated into the trachea. Chemoreceptors in the mid or upper esophageal mucosa are stimulated, resulting in refl ex respiratory inhibition, hypertension and bradycardia. Approximately 1% of infants demonstrate refl ux-induced apnea with airway closure or laryngospasm. 44 The severity of these reactions may lead to SIDS. 43 Bronchospasm may also occur and, in turn, accentuate the symptoms of asthma, although GER does not seem to increase the risk of developing asthma. 45 Recurrent bronchitis or pneumonia is frequent and can be caused by repeated pulmonary aspiration of acid refl ux. ENT problems such as nasal obstruction are sometimes related to GER, with secondary infl ammation and narrowing of the posterior nasal apertures. 46, 47 With premature infants, the most common complication of recurrent GER is failure to thrive.",

These children are said to cry for more than 3 hours per day, more than 3 days per week and for longer than 3 weeks. 55 Colic usually starts in the 1st month of life and may persist until 3 or 4 months of age. Crying is commonly concentrated in the late afternoon and evening, occurs in prolonged bouts and is unpredictable and spontaneous. Colicky children are described as crying without identifi able cause, fussing and hard-to-soothe, although being otherwise healthy infants, well fed and showing no signs of failure to thrive. Individual variation may be present in the cries, such as duration or intensity, associated fussing or the resulting parental distress, adding complexity to the defi nition. 56 Colic cries convey acoustic information that the infant is highly aroused or distressed. 57 During a crying episode, the infant usually positions their legs fl exed over their abdomen, in association with a hard distended abdomen, gurgling noises from the abdomen (borborygmi), sometimes gas and regurgitation, as well as facial grimacing and clenched fi sts. This presentation is indicative of a GI etiology for colic. When evaluating the colicky infant, several aspects of GI development and associated neurohormonal factors should be considered.",

Besides its function of digestion and absorption of the nutrients contained in food, the intestinal mucosa forms a protective barrier against foreign substances and potentially pathogenic microorganisms from the external environment. The mucosal barrier consists of cellular and stromal components covered by a mucus layer. Within the mucosal barrier various secretions form a viscoelastic gel, creating a site for bacteria-bacteria interactions. Thus, the microbiota play an important role in the development of the endogenous barrier mechanism in the gut and are involved in the maturation of humoral immunity in humans. 60 The intestine can be considered the primary immune organ, housing more than 70% of all immune cells. 25 The gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) develops through innate and acquired immunity and consists of organized and diffuse lymphoid tissues that constitute the aggregated lymphoid follicles (Peyer's patches) and the mesenteric lymph nodes. This arrangement permits rapid response to any challenge in order to maintain the integrity and protective functions of the immune barrier at the GI mucosal surface. The GALT contains B lymphocytes, implicated in the synthesis of secretory antibodies of the immunoglobulin A (IgA) class, and T lymphocytes. In this ecosystem, the equilibrium of the microbiota is important in the maintenance of homeostasis and intestinal immune responses. It is also of paramount importance in the prevention of food allergies, and it is during the fi rst 2 years of life, when the infantile fl ora is not well diversifi ed, that food allergies and enteropathies are more apt to be established.",

This is, however, subject to debate because no data support the hypothesis that infantile colic leads to an increased risk for subsequent allergic disease or atopy, 66 although more irritability during the 7th week and colic-type crying during the 12th week has been observed in children with atopic disease at 2 years of age. 67 Furthermore, lactose intolerance also contributes to infantile colic. 68 Incomplete lactose absorption encourages bacterial growth with resultant fl atulence and cramping. As the etiology of infantile colic is multifactorial, cow's milk protein elimination may be an effective treatment for infantile colic, 64 and for colicky breastfed infants a maternal diet free of cow's milk may be considered. 69 Other maternal dietary modifi cations during breastfeeding should include reduction of cruciferous vegetables, onion and chocolate, foods that are associated with colic symptoms in infants. 70 Hyperperistalsis is another theory included in the GI disorder etiology to explain abdominal cramping and colic. Intestinal smooth muscle normally generates rhythmic peristaltic activity. Movements of the intestine with the regulation of gut motility are the result of complex neural and muscular interactions that take place at several levels and under the infl uence of neurotransmitters and hormones. 71 The innervation of the gut consists of intrinsic and extrinsic nerves. Ganglionated and non-ganglionated plexi, part of the enteric nervous system (ENS), form the intrinsic innervation, while the vagus, splanchnic and pelvic nerves form the extrinsic innervation. The intrinsic afferent neurons project within the myenteric and submucous plexuses and information from activated sensory receptors reaches the CNS through vagal and spinal afferent nerves. The gut interacts constantly with the CNS through either somatic or autonomic neurons (brain-gut axis). Consequently, the CNS modulates the gut motor activity through the ANS (sympathetic and parasympathetic), maintaining the normal rhythm of activity in the GI tract as well as adjusting autonomic output to accommodate any external challenge. The release of acetylcholine by the parasympathetic fi bers increases gut motility, whereas the release of norepinephrine, somatostatin and neuropeptide Y by sympathetic fi bers decreases the motility. Multiple factors, such as emotion, stress, nervousness, fasting or eating, can also infl uence the activity of the ANS. Additionally, communication occurs between the different parts of the GI tract through myogenic and neurogenic signals along the gut, and through refl ex arcs transmitted via autonomic neurons.",

Accordingly, an increased sensitivity to stimuli, such as distension of the gut, is demonstrable in patients with functional GI disorders, 72 and excessive crying in colicky infants may be the result of hypersensitivity in the perception of gut stimuli or excessive afferent responses to these stimuli. 73 Genetic susceptibility to functional GI disorders may exist. Supporting this theory, a correlation is found between high responsiveness of the newborn during neurobehavioral assessment in the fi rst days of life and crying behavior at home. 74 Additionally, intestinal hypersensitivity may alter motility of the GI tract by increasing intestinal afferent-efferent refl exes. 75 Cranial osteopathy offers a therapeutic option for these patients. Osteopathic treatment of colicky infants has been demonstrated to decrease crying and increase sleep time. 76 Somatic dysfunction affects the ANS. The resulting state of facilitation, in turn, increases the perception of either mechanical or chemical intestinal stimuli, and visceral hypersensitivity or dysfunction follows. Somatic dysfunction can involve any osseous, articular, ligamentous, membranous, fascial, muscular, visceral and vascular component associated with the GI tract. Vagal viscerosensory neurons have their cell bodies in the inferior ganglion located under the jugular foramen. The spinal sensory input takes place through perivascular nerves passing through the prevertebral ganglia to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and these neurons have their cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia. Pain perception is thought to be mediated essentially by the spinal innervation. 77 The craniocervical junction (parasympathetic), the thoracic and thoracolumbar spine (sympathetic) and sacropelvic region (parasympathetic) may be sites of somatic dysfunction resulting in somatovisceral dysfunction. Treating these areas may contribute to balance the gut function of the colicky infant.",

Responses of mothers to infant crying diverge from putting the child to bed, to holding and carrying them, riding around in the car, rocking or swaddling. 79 Globally, fi rst-born babies are usually reported as crying more excessively, and the Western caregiving style is associated with a higher incidence of reported crying. 79, 80 Touching, holding and caressing a child results in positive effects on the emotion regulation and stress reactivity in the infant. 81 Maternal care facilitates the development of central corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) systems which regulate the expression of behavioral, endocrine and autonomic responses to stress. 82 It is well established that infant-maternal contact is of paramount importance in mediating infant emotional reactivity. Gut-brain peptide cholecystokinin (CCK) and endogenous opioid analgesic agent production are increased following contact. 81 This contributes to the development of attachment through the 'interactive regulation of biological synchronicity between organisms'. 83 Under normal conditions, this relationship between mother and infant contributes to the wellbeing of both.",

In extreme circumstances the irritability of the child can prove so stressful as to create an impulse to shake the child. 73 A potential psychosocial etiology for colic in the 1st year of life is associated with pre-existing maternal anxiety. 62 If the caregiver is stressed, the child will cry more, and the caregiver will be further worried by their incapacity to help the child. Furthermore, a baby is frequently described as crying excessively when the crying distresses the parents. Infants' cries can also be indicative of a behavioral problem resulting from a less than optimal parentinfant interaction. This complex interrelationship between the child and caregiver has led to a behavioral hypothesis for the etiology of colic where interventions such as modifying parental responsiveness, using motion and sound to calm the baby, and reducing stimuli have been suggested. 64 These caregivers do not need to be told that they are bad parents; they need to be supported and managed with understanding. The circumstances must be discussed and the caregiver given the opportunity to vent their anxiety and frustration. Behavioral adaptations, when appropriate, should be encouraged. Maternal smoking may contribute to the disorder. 84 One hypothesis for colic suggests that it is the result of transient developmental dysmaturation based on the fact that infantile colic often stops after 5 or 6 months. 85 It is important, nonetheless, to treat these children and help the parents, because persistent behavioral diffi culties, including crying, sleeping or feeding behavior in infancy, are precursors of hyperactivity or behavioral problems and academic diffi culties in childhood. 86 ",

            "text": "Most of the time, constipation is functional, without any objective evidence of an underlying pathologic condition and a thorough history and physical examination are suffi cient to make the diagnosis. It is, however, important to rule out failure to thrive or endocrine, metabolic or structural disease such as Hirschsprung's disease. Children presenting with this latter condition, characterized by the total absence of ganglion cells in Meissner's and Auerbach's plexuses, suffer from constipation with massive colonic dilatation proximal to the segment of affected bowel. The onset, however, occurs at birth with delayed passage of meconium and children suffering from the disease demonstrate poor growth. 91 Functional constipation has also been described as functional fecal retention, voluntary withholding, psychogenic megacolon or idiopathic constipation. It affects boys more often than girls, contrary to the adolescent and adult populations where women suffer more often from constipation. Another difference between children and the adult population is the presence of fecal incontinence in children, which is not present in adults with functional constipation. 91 During the fi rst months of life, infants may present with dyschezia, i.e. diffi culty in defecation. In this case they experience severe problems when trying to defecate and strain and scream during prolonged endeavors. This behavior may last up to 20 minutes, until they successfully pass stools that are usually soft or liquid. The cause is hypothesized to be the failure to coordinate the augmentation of intra-abdominal pressure with the relaxation of the pelvic muscles. 89 Painful defecation quite often results in chronic fecal retention with fecal impaction (the immovable collection of compressed or hardened feces in the colon or rectum) and resultant fecal soiling (the passage of liquid stool around the impaction). More than 50% of school-aged children suffering constipation have a history of painful defecation before 36 months of age. 92 Toddlers may succeed in avoiding defecation for several days. The evacuation that then occurs is often painful and may be associated with bleeding, thereby strengthening the behavior of fear and retention. Fecal retention, in turn, is associated with subsequent abnormal contraction of the anal sphincters (anismus) and contraction of the pelvic fl oor during attempted retention. The child develops a retentive posture with contraction of the gluteal muscles. With overstretching of the rectal wall and muscle fatigue in the pelvic fl oor, incompetent anal function results in spontaneous relaxation of the sphincters, with consequent fecal soiling with soft or liquid stool. Fecal soiling often follows constipation facilitated by rectal distension. 93 Constipated children demonstrate several associated symptoms including irritability, abdominal cramps and decreased appetite. Most of the time, children with constipation have a withholding type of behavior and very often feel ashamed. They demonstrate more behavioral problems than children who are not constipated; however, these accompanying symptoms disappear immediately following the effective treatment of constipation. 94 The role of psychological and emotional components in the etiology of defecation disorders is subject to debate. It is uncertain which problem comes fi rst: the emotional disorder or the defecation disorder. 94 Toilet training is normally initiated between the ages of 18 months and 3 years. When conducted in an overly coercive and stressful fashion, the associated stress has been proposed as a cause of fecal retention. However, when hard bowel movements or painful defecation are present in association with stool toilet training refusal, constipation should be considered because the fi rst episode of constipation in children usually occurs before stool toilet training refusal. 95 Familial environmental factors, or added parental anxiety because they want their child to be able to go to school, may add a psychological factor to a physical predisposition to constipation.",

It is well recognized that reduction of physical activity and reduction of fl uid intake in adults can be associated with constipation. Because children tend to be normally physically active, inactivity is not a major cause of constipation for this population. However, food allergy, particularly cow's milk allergy with cow's milk protein hypersensitivity, seems to be associated with constipation in children. 96, 97 Constipation may certainly be multifactorial. The behavioral approach does not explain every case of constipation. Furthermore, children with constipation demonstrate a higher incidence of bladder disorders such as urinary incontinence, bladder overactivity, dyscoordinated voiding, large bladder capacity, poorly emptying bladder, recurrent urinary tract infection and vesicoureteral refl ux. 98 This constitutes a syndrome, an aggregate of associated symptoms and signs that may be addressed by an osteopathic approach.

The buccinator has its origin posteriorly on the lateral aspect of the maxilla and oblique line of the mandible, the pterygoid hamulus and pterygomandibular raphe (Figs 7.7.2, 7.7.3). It inserts anteriorly on the angle of the mouth, the middle fi bers of the muscle crossing in the region of the modiolus, the lower set passing to the upper lip, the upper set to the lower lip. 5 The modiolus located near the corner of the mouth represents a convergence of several muscles of facial expression and, as such, observation of this area is highly indicative of the psychoemotional state of the individual. The fi bers of the buccinator muscle are interspersed with more horizontal portions of the orbicularis oris muscle. The buccinator fl attens the cheek, retracts the angle of the mouth and plays an important role in mastication in conjunction with the tongue and orbicularis oris muscle to form a belt on each side of the oral cavity, preventing food from accumulating in the oral vestibule. The quadrilaterally shaped mandibular ramus consists of two surfaces, four borders and two processes. The lateral surface is fl at and gives attachment to the masseter muscle. The masseter muscle is attached above on the inferior border of the anterior two-thirds of the zygomatic arch and the medial surface of the zygomatic arch. It inserts inferiorly on the lateral surface of the ramus and the coronoid process of the mandible. It elevates the mandible and its function is of paramount importance in the development, growth and maturation of the mandibular condyles and fossae. A reduction of masseter muscle activity in bottle-fed babies has been observed 6 and, with the loss of chewing behavior, may predispose to chewing/swallowing disorders and malocclusions. 7 Located on the medial surface of the mandibular ramus, approximately in its center, is the mandibular foramen leading to the mandibular canal. It contains the alveolar nerve and vessels. A sharp spine on the anterior margin of the foramen, the lingula (Spix spine), provides attachment for the sphenomandibular ligament. This site is of particular interest in mandibular kinematics because mandibular motion is centered on a point located near the lingula. The vascular-neural bundle is, therefore, protected from injury caused by normal mandibular motion. 8 The medial pterygoid muscle inserts below the mandibular foramen, on the medial surface of the mandibular angle. Thus, the mandibular angle is affected by the action of the masseter laterally and medial pterygoid medially. Traction from these muscles dynamically infl uences the growth of the mandible. This infl uence has to be balanced unilaterally between the masseter and medial pterygoid, as well as bilaterally.",

These cartilages develop bilaterally in the fi rst pharyngeal arches. The primitive TMJ starts to organize during the 7th week of development, concomitantly with the emergence of muscular activity in the masticatory apparatus. At birth the mandible consists of two parts separated by a cartilaginous symphysis menti not yet ossifi ed. The body, although rather underdeveloped, is much larger than the rami. It consists of relatively thin cortices with tooth buds almost totally occupying its volume. 9 Each side contains the sockets of the two incisors, the canine and the two deciduous molar teeth. The angle between the body and the ramus is obtuse (175\u00b0), and the coronoid process, of rather large size, projects above the level of the condyle. At birth, the TMJ is slack. The mandibular fossa of the temporal bone in which the condylar process of the mandible is located is almost fl at, providing little stability. 10 During the fi rst years of life growth will occur through bony deposition and resorption. Bone deposition occurs on the mandibular labial side, whereas resorption occurs on the lingual side, thus allowing for elongation of the mandible and more space for the deciduous dentition. 11 The two halves of the mandible join during the 1st year, although a line of separation may still be seen in the beginning of the 2nd year. Concomitant development of mastication stimulates growth of the alveolar and subdental portions of the mandibular body, allowing in turn more powerful traction from the masticatory muscles. During the fi rst 3 years of life, mandibular bicondylar width grows rapidly, in synchrony with cranial base growth. It is the fastest growth period of the mandible. With the development of permanent dentition, the angle becomes less obtuse -140\u00b0 at about the 4th year. Crown formation of the permanent teeth, and their following eruption, is a time of possible occlusal instability, lasting up to 10-12 years of age when the majority of the permanent teeth have erupted. After puberty, the mandibular angle is 120\u00b0 (Fig. 7.4.4) .",

Above, it fuses with the periosteum along the superior nuchal line of the occipital bone, on the mastoid and styloid processes of the temporal bone and the complete base of the mandible. 1 The stylomandibular ligament, a condensation of the deep cervical fascia, extends from the tip of the styloid process of the temporal bone to the posterior border of the angle of the mandible. This fascia links the mandible to the base of the skull. Thus, dysfunction of the cranial base may affect the mandible, and vice versa. It is of great signifi cance in the fi rst years of life, when structures have not yet completed their growth. As such, torticollis or plagiocephaly, if untreated, may predispose to somatic dysfunction of the mandible and viscerocranium, leading to malocclusion. 12 As it belongs to the cranial base, the sphenoid also infl uences the mandible through its muscular and ligamentous relations. The sphenomandibular ligament is of particular importance. This fi brous band, a remnant of Meckel's cartilage, runs from the spine of the sphenoid's greater wing to the lingula of the mandible. It constitutes the primary passive support of the mandible, with the area of the lingula acting as an anchor. An artifi cial axis passing through the two lingulae may be proposed, around which motions of the mandible occur. These motions include depression of the mandible during opening of the mouth and elevation during closure, as well as protraction and retraction. The mandible may be compared to a swing hanging under the sphenoid's greater wings.

With the larynx, the tongue contributes to the production of sounds and speech. Finally, the tongue seems to play an important proprioceptive role that, in turn, functionally or dysfunctionally regulates all of these activities. 1 The tongue consists of a mass of muscle covered by mucous membrane, where the papillae of the gustatory organ are located. The lingual musculature is divided into intrinsic and extrinsic muscles. The intrinsic muscles, which are totally contained inside the tongue, are the bilateral superior and inferior longitudinal, the transverse and the vertical lingual muscles. Conversely, the extrinsic muscles extend outside the tongue and consist of the genioglossus, hyoglossus, styloglossus and palatoglossus muscles. The lingual musculature matures quite early in life, transforming the tongue into a powerful growth stimulator for the surrounding structures.",

Because of abnormal shortness, the frenulum linguae tethers the tongue to the fl oor of the mouth, impairs lingual mobility and, in severe cases, prohibits its extension beyond the lower gum. Although it may present as part of several craniofacial syndromes, in most cases the child is perfectly healthy. 19 Ankyloglossia is, however, associated with up to 12.8% of serious breastfeeding problems. 20 It is also a potential etiology for speech disorders 21 and dental problems, 22 such as diastasis between the lower incisors due to the lingual pressure. 23 Furthermore, impaired lingual mobility is related to diffi culty with intraoral toileting and later with the playing of wind instruments. 23 Although surgical treatment (frenuloplasty or tongue-tie division) remains debated, in specifi c indications it is reported to improve diffi cult breastfeeding and to protect the maternal nipple, 24 and to alleviate speech disorders and improve tongue mobility. 25 Swallowing, or deglutition, is one of the fi rst orofacial functions to appear in utero and has been observed after 11 weeks, when the child refl exively swallows amniotic fl uid. 1 At birth, new habits develop with feeding, allowing the evolution of the pattern of deglutition. In the infant, sucking and swallowing are the results of a pumping action in the hyolingual complex, with a rhythmic tongue thrust, the tip of the tongue showing regularly between the alveolar processes. Musculoskeletal growth and maturation of the neuromuscular system result in the development of a more mature or adult swallowing pattern. At around 2-3 years of age, at rest and during swallowing, the apex of the tongue is normally located on the palate, behind the upper incisor teeth. When swallowing, the lips are closed, but the perioral musculature, particularly the orbicularis oris and mentalis muscles, is relaxed. Lingual pressure applied against the palate contributes to the development of a broad palate and well-developed maxillae. The tongue works as a natural orthodontic appliance 'for better or for worse'. 26 In the cheeks, the muscular bands formed by the buccinator and superior constrictor muscles, joined together through the pterygomandibular raphe, bilaterally act to constrain the tongue within the oral cavity. Thus, functional balance or dysfunction of the cervical spine and cranial base, the sites of origin of the superior constrictor, contributes significantly to lingual posture. In addition, because the tongue is anchored on the mandible, it affects and is affected by mandibular position and growth. When mature or adult swallowing does not develop successfully, immature or atypical swallowing will continue.",

First, mastication occurs purely in the sagittal plane, with the mandible moving up and down, and demonstrating propulsion and retraction. Then, progressively, an alternating unilateral chewing pattern appears, with diagonal movements of the mandible. 8 The masticatory muscles develop in response to this demand. At around 9 months of age, a child can chew soft food and keep it in their mouth; 1 year later they can chew more solid foods. 27 As such, their diet should include food that requires suffi cient chewing to allow satisfactory occlusal force per chew that can, in turn, stimulate periosteal growth. Symmetric chewing is a requisite for adequate muscular stimulation of the digastric, temporal and pterygoid muscles. The traction of these muscles will, in turn, stimulate bone growth. At this time cranial balance is necessary to facilitate the establishment of symmetric masticatory patterns that are learned and practiced throughout the rest of life, making early identifi cation and treatment of somatic dysfunction essential.",

Under normal circumstances the soft palate and tongue act in apposition to close the oropharyngeal isthmus; conversely, when the soft palate rises and contacts the posterior pharyngeal wall, the nasopharynx is closed. Thus, the position of the soft palate determines the route of respiration and regulation of airfl ow through the nose or mouth. The soft palate is united with the tongue through the palatoglossi muscles and with the pharynx through the palatopharyngei muscles. For optimal function of all of the structures that contribute to upper airway respiration, somatic dysfunction affecting the sites of origin of these muscles should be identifi ed and treated. For optimal breathing, the cranial base, hyoid bone and mandible should be balanced. It is well established that an inferoposterior displacement of the hyoid bone and an anteroinferior positioning of the tongue are correlated with mouth breathing. [28] [29] [30] Normally, the tongue demonstrates large movements in all three planes of space. 31 In the production of sounds and speech, the tongue must change shape and the dorsum of the tongue must contact the palate. Shortening of the base of the tongue results from anterior displacement of the hyoid bone, whereas lengthening of the base of the tongue results from its posterior displacement. By employing the activity of the lingual muscles, speech contributes to the overall function and development of the orofacial cavity.",

The lower central incisors are normally the fi rst to appear between 6 and 8 months of age. When the upper central incisors emerge, the fi rst occlusal relationship appears, associated with new constraint for mandibular mobility. The upper and lower lateral incisors are almost completely erupted at around 14 months, the time when the fi rst molars appear. Just before the end of the 2nd year of life, the central and lateral incisors and the fi rst molars are in occlusion, the canines have erupted and the second molars are beginning to emerge. In the 2nd year of life, the 20 deciduous teeth are present, with occlusion between the incisors, canines and fi rst molars. At the same time, the child's orofacial functions have matured and their food is becoming more solid. Mouthing (active oral interaction with the environment by sucking different objects) is still quite frequent up to 3 years of age. Several explanations -from a means of exploring their environment to proactively exposing the naive GI tract to environmental antigens -have been offered for this behavior. 33 Whatever the reason, mouthing effectively contributes to dental attrition, thereby eliminating any dysfunctional occlusal contact and facilitating functional adaptation. Smoothing of the occlusal surfaces results in proprioception important in establishing functional balance of mandibular motion patterns. Conversely, any dysfunctional occlusal contact will result in dysfunctional mandibular motion patterns and stimulate abnormal mandibular and maxillary growth. 34 It will also prevent the establishment of alternating unilateral mastication.",

Proprioceptive input from the periodontal ligament in association with proprioception from the TMJ and surrounding myofascial structures provides constant information to the CNS. This allows the individual to adjust to the challenges of mastication as well as to global postural mechanics. 35 Deciduous teeth are small, with thin enamel coverage, allowing rapid wearing out. On the other hand, permanent teeth are the hardest of all tissues in the body. Each consists of a crown and a root, meeting at the cervical margin. Dentine forms most of the tooth, with a central pulp cavity ending in a pulp chamber and canal. The side of the tooth in contact with the lips and cheeks is the labial or buccal surface while the side in contact with the tongue is the lingual or palatal surface. When the jaws are brought together the teeth meet, or occlude; thus, dental occlusion occurs. Occlusion is qualifi ed according to the respective positions of the teeth.

Class I identifi es the normal relationship of the jaws, where the mesiobuccal cusp of the maxillary fi rst molar occludes in the buccal groove of the mandibular fi rst molar. In the individual with normal dentition and centric occlusion, the lower incisors bite against the lingual surfaces of the upper incisors, the crowns of the lower incisors being covered in their superior third. In addition, from the canine teeth backwards, each lower tooth is slightly in front of its upper fellow. Classes II and III categorize variations of malocclusion. In Class II, all the lower teeth occlude distal to normal, wherein the distobuccal cusp of the maxillary fi rst molar occludes in the buccal groove of the mandibular fi rst molar. In addition, this class is further subdivided into Division 1, labioversion of maxillary incisor teeth, and Division 2, linguoversion of maxillary central incisors. This may occur unilaterally of bilaterally. Class II is the most frequently encountered type of malocclusion. In Class III, all the lower teeth occlude mesial to normal, wherein the mesiobuccal cusp of the maxillary fi rst molar occludes in the embrasure between the mandibular fi rst and second permanent molars.

Besides the genetic aspect of malocclusion, in particular for Class III, 37 malocclusal patterns are felt to result from an imbalance between intrinsic forces such as from the tongue and lips and extrinsic forces such as stressful orofacial habits. A large number of studies have considered the infl uence of epigenetic factors such as the orofacial functions of deglutition, sucking, ventilation, mastication and phonation (see below). In fact, it is more the orofacial dysfunctions and parafunctions or orofacial habits that are the source of malocclusion. Edward Angle said: 'Orthodontic treatments are very unlikely to succeed, if the functional disorders are still going on.' 38 Class II malocclusion represents a heterogeneous collection of conditions with malocclusion that may be the result of purely skeletal or combined skeletal and dental origin; they are, however, more often purely dental in nature. 39 The teeth and alveolar bone constitute an interface between opposing forces and pressures, primarily from muscular function -the perioral musculature of the lips and cheeks on the one hand and intraoral forces from the tongue on the other. Pressures are applied to the teeth with varying distribution according to the oral function involved. 40 Under appropriate circumstances these pressures should affect the teeth from multiple, yet balanced, directions. When dysfunction results in chronically repeated patterns of activity, limiting the directions that these muscular pressures are applied to the teeth, dental malocclusion can be the result.",

It consequently results in dysfunctional forward placement of the tongue.

            "text": "Respiratory dysfunctions are also associated with malocclusion. Premature molar eruption is often present in chronic mouth breathers. Mandibular growth is affected, with resulting anterior mandibular rotation 29 and an increase of the mandibular angle. 30 Thus, the vertical dimension of the lower face is increased, with resultant open bite. 29 The term 'adenoidal facies' (long faces) describes infants with an open mouth, a short upper lip and prominent and crowded anterior teeth. Lip hypotonicity -decreased tonicity of the orbicularis oris muscle -is typically found in patients with Class II, Division 1 malocclusion. 55 In this presentation, hypotonicity of the orbicularis oris muscle is balanced by compensatory contraction in the mentalis muscles. It is this aspect that can be observed in patients with 'adenoidal facies' syndrome. In addition, the maxillae are narrow and the palate high arched with concomittant increase in the mandibular angle; thus the face appears longer. 56 These individuals also demonstrate a lack of development of the masseter muscles as well as of the maxillary bones. 57 Alternatively, hypertonic and bulbous masseter muscles with reduced facial height are correlated with a tendency to clench the teeth. 57 These fi ndings are commonly identifi ed in association with cranial somatic dysfunction involving the temporal bones and/or TMJs. The cranial concept lends itself well to the understanding of functional orofacial disorders. Children who have dysfunctional extension of the SBS will present with a long narrow head. The resultant internal rotation of the maxillae is associated with a palate that is narrow and high arched. This orofacial cranial pattern fails to provide suffi cient space for the teeth in the dental arches, predisposing the child to dental crowding. In young children, Class II malocclusion may be found in association with an intraosseous dysfunction between the premaxilla and the maxilla. The premaxilla can be pushed forward or backward as the result of stress patterns occurring during intrauterine life or at the time of delivery. Postpartum behaviors, such as thumb sucking, can also push the premaxilla forward, while a fall forward striking the face, particularly the upper incisors, will push the premaxilla in a posterior direction.",

            "text": "The child's occlusal pattern should be assessed. If abnormal occlusion or malocclusion is identifi ed, the somatic dysfunction that may be responsible should be sought out and treated. The etiology of malocclusion is multifactorial and osteopathic procedures may be employed when cranial somatic dysfunction contributing to the establishment of the malocclusive pattern is present. To be effective, these procedures should be employed at the earliest possible age. Cranial manipulation is in no way intended to be a replacement for standard orthodontic treatment. However, orthodontic treatments are less likely to be fully successful if somatic dysfunction affecting the child's occlusal pattern persists.When examining the child with malocclusion, the principles of examination discussed above in 'Oral cavity and orofacial functions' apply. In addition, when looking for contributory somatic dysfunction, the practitioner should pay attention to the standing postural mechanics and their impact, particularly on the upper thoracic and occipitoatlantal areas. Even in cases where orthodontic treatment has been initiated, the child's posture should be addressed. The identifi cation and treatment of dysfunctional postural mechanics resulting in functional balance of the orofacial complex will accelerate the effect of the orthodontic treatment. Furthermore, orthodontic treatment in itself serves as a source of stress, affecting the overall mechanics of the body. Thus, the release of existing dysfunctional mechanics will provide comfort to the child, making the orthodontic process more tolerable, as well as facilitating the effect of the orthodontic procedure.With the child seated, it is appropriate to observe the occlusal pattern. Have the child actively open their mouth while observing for displacement of the symphysis menti. This motion normally should follow a straight vertical path, without a distorted pattern. Next, have the child move their mandible laterally to the right and left sides to compare ease of movement and degree of displacement bilaterally. If appropriate, give the child some chewing gum to observe the presence or absence of an alternating masticatory pattern. Observe and note the presence of a dominant side to the masticatory pattern. Check the presence of immature swallowing by observing and asking the child to describe the location of the tip of their tongue within their mouth during swallowing. Assess the musculature of the lips and cheeks by placing your thumbs inside the child's mouth, such that their palmar surfaces are in contact with the inside of the cheeks. Ask the child to close their mouth and swallow, and with your thumbs appreciate the strength of contraction of the buccinator muscles. Next, with the child lying supine, palpate the clavicles, sternum and hyoid bone, assessing their myofascial attachments. Go on to assess the myofascial structures of the upper thoracic and cervical spine for somatic dysfunction, noting the relationship between the occiput and atlas. Palpate the myofascial structures of the skull, paying attention to the orofacial muscles and TMJ area for dysfunctional asymmetric tension. Check the TMJs and proceed with tests of listening. Evaluate the cranial base, looking for patterns of predominant cranial fl exion or extension, as well as torsion, sidebending-rotation, compression and strain patterns. By placing one hand on the frontal bone with the index and middle fi ngers controlling the greater wings of the sphenoid and the other hand cradling the mandible, note the balance between the mandible and greater wings of the sphenoid. Listen to the different bones of the skull that may be involved in the malocclusion, paying particular attention to the temporal bones, sphenoid, frontal bones and maxillae, looking for intra-and interosseous cranial somatic dysfunctions. Treat all identifi ed somatic dysfunction using indirect principles. Intraosseous molding may be considered if the child is young enough.All of these relationships are often reciprocal and illustrate the integration of all parts of the body, local and distant, into a united system. Osteopathic treatment may be employed to address the somatic dysfunction that is found in association with orofacial dysfunction. When indirect principles of treatment are respectfully employed, these procedures may be used to treat from the very youngest patient on through adolescence. The earlier the dysfunction is recognized, the younger the patient and the more plastic the tissues, the greater the possibility to affect the structure and to re-establish satisfactory functional patterns, thereby activating the body's inherent ability to heal itself.",

Encourage the child to practice activities that promote breathing, such as singing with good articulation of the words.Young children with dysfunctional tongue mechanics or with minor cases of ankyloglossia can perform exercises to mobilize the tongue and to stretch the frenulum as much as possible. Encourage the parents or caregivers to correct the child when there is mispronunciation. It may appear to be cute, but is actually dysfunctional. The child should repeat incorrectly pronounced words as correctly as possible to improve tongue mobility. Infants can be encouraged to play sound-making games by repeating sounds that cause the tongue to make a clicking noise against the palate.Teach effi cient swallowing without tongue thrusting by instructing the child to consciously keep their tongue in their mouth and to learn to swallow with the tip of their tongue resting against the palate behind their upper incisors. To practice this, the child can hold a small piece of food between the tongue and palate while attempting to swallow several times. This exercise should be repeated until the act of swallowing with the tip of the tongue resting against the palate becomes automatic.Insist on alternate unilateral mastication and that the child takes suffi cient time to chew their food thoroughly. Those children who are old enough should be encouraged to eat food that is as unrefi ned as possible. Soft refi ned junk food often does not require suffi cient chewing.Caution the parent or caregiver to watch for functional asymmetries that are associated with repetitive asymmetrical activities, such as unilateral bottle feeding or thumb sucking. Instruct the parent or caregiver and the patient, when old enough to understand, to avoid these activities or perform them in a fashion that alternates sides.",
