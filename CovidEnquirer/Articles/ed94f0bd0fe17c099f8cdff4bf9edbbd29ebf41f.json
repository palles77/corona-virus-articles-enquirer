Purpose: To address the urgent need for an MERS vaccine, in the present study, we have designed two multi-epitope vaccines (MEVs) against MERS utilizing several in silico methods and tools. Methods: The design of both the multi-epitope vaccines (MEVs) are composed of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and helper T lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes, screened form thirteen different proteins of MERS-CoV. Both the MEVs also carry potential B-cell linear epitope regions, B-cell discontinuous epitopes as well as interferon-\u03b3-inducing epitopes. Human \u03b2-defensin-2 and \u03b2-defensin-3 were used as adjuvants to enhance the immune response of MEVs. To design the MEVs, short peptide molecular linkers were utilized to link screened most potential CTL epitopes, HTL epitopes and the adjuvants. Tertiary models for both the MEVs were generated, refined, and further studied for their molecular interaction with toll-like receptor 3. The cDNAs of both MEVs were generated and analyzed in silico for their expression in a mammalian host cell line (human). Results: Screened CTL and HTL epitopes were found to have high propensity for stable molecular interaction with HLA alleles molecules. CTL epitopes were also found to have favorable molecular interaction within the cavity of transporter associated with antigen processing. The selected CTL and HTL epitopes jointly cover upto 94.0% of worldwide human population. Both the CTL and HTL MEVs molecular models have shown to have stable binding and complex formation propensity with toll-like receptor 3. The cDNA analysis of both the MEVs have shown high expression tendency in mammalian host cell line (human). Conclusion: After multistage in silico analysis, both the MEVs are predicted to elicit humoral as well as cell mediated immune response. Epitopes of the designed MEVs are predicted to cover large human population worldwide. Hence both the designed MEVs could be tried in vivo as potential vaccine candidates against MERS. submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com Dovepress Dovepress 2378 srivastava et al",

            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a respiratory disease caused by Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). MERS involves high fever, cough, difficulty in breathing, chills, chest pain, body aches, sore throat, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, running nose, renal failure, and pneumonia. The first case of MERS in humans was reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. After 2012, within a span of only 4 years, MERS-CoV infection was reported from 27 countries. 1 Three MERS outbreaks have already occurred in Saudi Arabia (2013 and 2014) and South Korea (2015). [2] [3] [4] The outbreak reported in South Korea also involved spread of MERS through hospital-to-hospital transit of patients and had the fatality rate as high as 40%. High attack rate and easy spread of MERS indicate an epidemic risk. [5] [6] [7] To date, no specific vaccine is available for MERS. The steep increase in MERS cases and its high mortality rate demand an urgent need for specific and safe MERS vaccine. Thus far, only little information is known about the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV. Hence, an immunoinformatics approach to thoroughly study and screen immunogenic proteins from the available proteome sequence data of MERS-CoV is essential for vaccine design.",

            "text": "The proteome of MERS-CoV consists of several important vaccine candidate and drug target proteins. These proteins are involved in infection and pathogenesis of MERS-CoV to human host cells. Spike (S) glycoprotein, in particular, its receptor-binding domain, is involved in virus and host cell interaction. 8 Envelope (E) protein plays an important role in host cell recognition. 9 Nucleocapsid (N) protein is involved in RNA binding during ribonucleocapsid formation by MERS-CoV. 10 Membrane (M) protein has interferon (IFN)-antagonizing properties, thus reducing IFN levels in infected patients. 11 Open reading frame (ORF) proteins also play critical roles in viral infection and pathogenesis. A mutation study of ORFs (ORF3, ORF4a, ORF4b, and ORF5) indicated that ORFs have major implications in viral infection involving disruption of host cell processes, dysregulated IFN pathway activation, and abrupt inflammation. 12 Proteins ORF1a (4P16) and ORF1ab (4WUR) are papain-like proteases (PL(pro)) involved in viral infection and are potential targets for the development of antiviral drugs. 13 PL(pro) facilitate infection by their proteolytic, deubiquitinating, and deISGylating activities suppressing innate immune response from the host cell. Protein ORF1a (4RSP), a protease (3CLpro), facilitates proteolytic activity during viral infection and replication. 14, 15 Protein ORF1ab (5WWP) is a helicase protein of MERS-CoV, and it is one of the most conserved proteins among nidoviruses. Protein ORF8b is a highly conserved protein, and during infection, it induces various immune responses. 16 In the present study, we propose two multi-epitope vaccine (MEV) designs for MERS. The proposed MEVs are composed of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and helper T lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes. Both CTL and HTL MEVs contain overlapping regions of linear B-cell epitopes. Both MEVs also contain human \u03b2-defensin-2 (hBD-2) and human \u03b2-defensin-3 (hBD-3) as adjuvants to enhance the immunogenic response. 17, 18 Methodology To design the MEVs, different in silico tools were used to screen potential CTL, HTL, and B-cell epitopes from 13 MERS-CoV proteins that are involved in virus-host interaction and viral proliferation. All three types of epitopes were studied for overlapping consensus regions. CTL and HTL epitopes showing partial or complete overlapping regions with all or any of the three kinds of epitopes and the epitopes with the highest number of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele binders were selected for detailed analysis. The selected CTL and HTL epitopes were further validated for their molecular interaction with their HLA allele binders. Furthermore, the selected CTL epitopes were validated for their molecular interaction with cavity of transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) to analyze their smooth passage from the cytoplasm to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen. 19 Three-dimensional (3D) structure model for both MEVs was generated, refined, validated, and analyzed for different physiochemical properties. Both CTL and HTL MEV models were further screened to have several B-cell discontinuous epitopes and IFN-\u03b3-inducing epitopes. Because the immune system broadly recognizes pathogens partially due to the involvement of toll-like receptor 3 (TLR-3) and its signaling cascade, both CTL and HTL MEVs were further studied for their molecular interaction with TLR-3. 20,21 Moreover, the cDNAs of both MEVs were analyzed and were predicted to be highly expressing in a mammalian host cell line (human) ( Figure S1 ).",

These methods include \"BepiPred Linear Epitope Prediction\" (propensity scale method such as hidden Markov model), \"Chou & Fasman Beta-Turn Prediction\", \"Emini Surface Accessibility Prediction\", \"Karplus & Schulz Flexibility Prediction\", \"Kolaskar & Tongaonkar Antigenicity\", and \"Parker Hydrophilicity Prediction\". [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] structure-based B-cell epitope prediction Two structure-based B-cell epitope prediction methods, namely, DiscoTope 2.0 (Structure-based Antibody Prediction tool; http://tools.iedb.org/discotope/) and Ellipro (Antibody Epitope Prediction tool; http://tools.iedb.org/ellipro/), available in IEDB, were used for linear and discontinuous B-cell epitope prediction. 38, 39 The ElliPro method is based on the location of the residue in the protein's 3D structure. The residues lying outside of the ellipsoid covering 90% of the inner core residues of the protein score highest protrusion index (PI) of 0.9 and so on. Discontinuous epitopes predicted by ElliPro are clustered on the basis of distance R in \u00c5 between two residues' centers of mass lying outside the largest possible ellipsoid. The larger the value of R, the larger will be the number of discontinuous epitopes clustered. DiscoTope 2.0 is based on the number of contacts of the residues' C\u03b1 carbon atom with other C\u03b1 carbon atoms in the 3D structure within the 10 \u00c5 distance and the propensity of a residue to be a part of an epitope. Toxicity assessment of CTL and HTL epitopes and B-cell epitopes was performed by ToxinPred (http://crdd.osdd.net/ raghava/toxinpred/multi_submit.php) analysis. This analysis allows to identify highly toxic or nontoxic peptides. The analysis was performed by the \"support vector machine (SVM) (SwissProt)-based\" method with all the parameters set to default. 41 Overlapping residue analysis Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) analysis using the Clustal Omega tool (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/ msa/clustalo/) of European Bioinformatics Institute was performed for all the shortlisted CTL, HTL, and B-cell epitopes from 13 MERS-CoV proteins. 42 MSA by Clustal Omega virtually aligns any number of protein sequences and delivers accurate alignments.",

The tool generates overlapping sequences from the query protein/antigen and uses it for IFN-\u03b3-inducing epitope prediction. The prediction is based on a dataset of IFN-\u03b3-inducing and IFN-\u03b3-noninducing MHC class II binders. 54 For both MEVs, AlgPred was used for allergenicity prediction (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/algpred/submission.html). 56 The AlgPred prediction of allergens is based on similarity of the known epitope with any region of the submitted protein. VaxiJen (http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/vaxijen/ VaxiJen/VaxiJen.html) was used to analyze the probability of antigenicity of both MEVs. 57 The VaxiJen analysis applies an alignment-free approach that is solely based on the physicochemical properties of the sequences of the submitted proteins.",

Docking complexes thus formed have significantly negative binding energy, and several amino acid residues of epitopes and HLA alleles were involved in hydrogen bond formation ( Figure 4 ). To analyze the stability of binding, docking complexes were further subjected to MD simulation study with an analysis time window of 0.1 ns at the reasonably invariable temperature (~300 K) and pressure (~1 bar). The results of MD simulation for all the epitope-HLA allele complexes showed a very convincing reasonably invariant root mean square deviation (RMSD) value between ~0.1 and 0.2 nm, thus indicating stable complex formation ( Figure 5) . Moreover, the reasonably invariant radius of gyration (Rg) of the complexes ( Figure S2 ) and RMS fluctuation (RMSF) for all the atoms in the complexes ( Figure S3 ) indicate that the epitope-HLA complexes remain very stable in their folded form. B-factor of the epitope and HLA allele complexes is shown in the rainbow color presentation in Figure S4 . Most of the regions of the complexes are stable (blue) with a very small region being acceptably fluctuating (yellow and orange).",
