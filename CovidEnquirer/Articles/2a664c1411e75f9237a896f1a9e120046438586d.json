            "text": "Feline coronaviruses (FCoV) comprise two biotypes: feline enteric coronaviruses (FECV) and feline infectious peritonitis viruses (FIPV). FECV is associated with asymptomatic persistent enteric infections, while FIPV causes feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a usually fatal systemic disease in domestic cats and some wild Felidae. FIPV arises from FECV by mutation. FCoV also occur in two serotypes, I and II, of which the serotype I viruses are by far the most prevalent in the field. Yet, most of our knowledge about FCoV infections relates to serotype II viruses, particularly about the FIPV, mainly because type I viruses grow poorly in cell culture. Hence, the aim of the present work was the detailed study of the epidemiologically most relevant viruses, the avirulent serotype I viruses. Kittens were inoculated oronasally with different doses of two independent FECV field strains, UCD and RM. Persistent infection could be reproducibly established. The patterns of clinical symptoms, faecal virus shedding and seroconversion were monitored for up to 10 weeks revealing subtle but reproducible differences between the two viruses. Faecal virus, i.e. genomic RNA, was detected during persistent FECV infection only in the large intestine, downstream of the appendix, and could occasionally be observed also in the blood. The implications of our results, particularly our insights into the persistently infected state, are discussed.",

            "text": "Feline coronaviruses (FCoV) present themselves in different forms. First of all there are two biotypes, the low-or avirulent viruses and the highly virulent ones. The former viruses cause intestinal infection with no or only mild clinical manifestations, i.e. diarrhoea in young kittens. These so-called feline enteric coronaviruses (FECV) are the predominant pathotype in the field. FECV infection often persists in apparently healthy animals, which shed the virus in their faeces. Natural infection occurs via the faecal-oral route. FECV infection appears to be mainly restricted to the intestinal tract where the virus replicates in villous epithelial cells. The virulent pathotype, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), causes severe systemic infection with lesions in many organs and tissues, most typically in the peritoneum, hence the disease's name feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). Unlike FECV, FIPV does not spread readily among cats. Instead, it originates de novo by spontaneous mutation from FECV in individual animals [4, 24, 26, 30] often under conditions of immune suppression due to medication or coinfection [26] . FIP is a highly fatal disease that occurs in domestic cats and some wild felidae usually between 3 and 16 months of age. The disease is currently the leading infectious cause of death in domestic cats. In catteries 80 to 90% of the animals are usually feline coronavirus seropositive, in single cat households seropositivity often varies between 10 and 50% [20] . From the seropositive cats, 5 to 12% eventually develop FIP [1] . There is at present no effective way to prevent the infection or treat the disease. For recent reviews on FCoV, see Haijema et al. [11] and Pedersen [25] .",

After washing the plates again with PBS-Tween20, peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-cat IgG (Cappel Laboratories Inc., Downingtown, USA) was added to the wells and the plates were again incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Subsequently, the plates were rinsed and 100 lL substrate solution containing 0.1 mg/mL tetramethylbenzidine-H 2 O 2 in 0.1 M sodium acetate was added to the wells. The substrate reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 lL 2 M H 2 SO 4 . The absorbance at 450 nm was determined on a EL808 Ultra Microplate Reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, USA). A titration curve was obtained by plotting the optical density as a function of the reciprocal serum dilution. The titre was defined as the highest dilution of serum corresponding to an optical density of 0.2 above the background, as extrapolated from the slope of the curve (background values were determined using a FCoV negative serum). The significance of the differences in the serum antibody titres was analyzed using Student's t-test.",

The other cat, inoculated with 10 \u00c03 diluted faecal extract, developed a recurring fever, with temperatures ! 40\u00b0C on days 2, 26, 35, 40 and 62 post inoculation. The body temperature of the remaining cats stayed between 37.6 and 40.0\u00b0C throughout the experiment. Interestingly, two cats, inoculated with a 10 \u00c03 and a 10 \u00c02 dilution, respectively, which were apparently able to contain the persistent infection and to reduce viral titres in the faeces, showed a stronger increase in body weight than the other animals (Fig. 4) . The FECV RM infected cats grew normally, without weight loss or growth retardation, and showed no clinical signs of disease during the entire experimental period. The disease signs observed with the UCD strain are thus unlikely to be caused by experimental conditions such as manipulation-induced stress.",

Their intestines were sectioned over their entire length in 5-cm (from stomach up to the appendix) and 1-cm segments (remainder). Viral RNA in each segment was determined by real-time RT-PCR. As shown in Figure 6 , no virus was detectable in the first approximately 150 cm long part comprising duodenum, jejunum and ileum. In both animals virus was found only in the approximately 15-20 cm final part of the gut, downstream of the appendix, i.e. in colon and rectum. While viral RNA was found in the faeces part of essentially all segments of these compartments, no viral RNA could be detected in several of the corresponding tissue specimens, suggesting that at this late stage of persistence the number or areas of virus-producing cells have become scarce. Consistent with this interpretation, attempts to visualize infected cells in fixed sections of the epithelial lining of the intestines by immunoperoxidase staining were unsuccessful.",

These insights in turn might provide leads to prevent this transition or treat the disease.

            "text": "Inoculation through the natural, oronasal route invariably initiated an immediate infection as judged by the rapid onset of shedding of virus with the faeces. At the highest doses shedding started already at day 1 (strain UCD) and 2 (strain RM), at lower doses within three days after inoculation. Titres rose rapidly, peaking about two days later at 10 6 -10 8 genome equivalents/lL irrespective of the dose and staying high thereafter for the next 2 to 3 weeks. Shedding continued during the subsequent two months at a gradually but slowly decreasing level except for the four animals inoculated with the lowest FECV RM doses, which all ceased shedding from about 6 weeks onwards. These results are in part consistent with a study by Pedersen et al. [24] in which experimentally infected cats were systematically monitored over longer (8-48 months) periods. Based on the shedding patterns of the 29 cats that had been inoculated orally with (an unknown dose of) FECV strain RM, the authors of this study distinguished three excretion types: persistent, intermittent and self-limiting. Though our monitoring period was too short to allow such classification, the shedding patterns we observed with this RM strain indicate that the inoculation dose can affect the type of excretion, lower doses giving rise to earlier clearance of the infection than higher doses. This is remarkable in view of the comparable excretion levels at the peak of shedding. For the UCD strain this distinction could not be made. Within the range of inoculation doses that we used in our dose titration experiments, the threshold below which infection becomes ineffective was not reached. The observations in Figure 1 suggest that rather low doses are probably sufficient to establish FECV infection, consistent with the efficient spread of the virus in the field. For FECV UCD our lowest dose was 5 \u00b7 10 5 genome equivalents. The average amount of this virus shed during the first 45 days of the infection was around 5 \u00b7 10 5 genomes/ lL. From this it is clear that only traces of the faeces from such infected cats will already suffice to initiate an infection in a new host.",

These systemic antibodies, which were directed against all major viral structural proteins, were obviously unable to efficiently clear the local FECV infection as shedding of virus with the faeces continued in their presence. Our observations are consistent with the few reports regarding immune responses to experimental FECV infection, and in which low and often variable antibody titres were found in serum or plasma [21, 24, 26] . Little is known about mucosal immune responses to FECV infection in the gut. Though probably the most important for the control and clearance of the infection, local immunity is evidently inadequate.

While cells of the monocyte lineage are the prime targets of FIPV, these cells are poorly susceptibility to FECV and support its replication and spread very inefficiently, at least in vitro [27, 29] . In one study using blood from 22 cats, the monocytes from three cats were not susceptible to FECV while the cells from the other animals could be infected but did not sustain the infection [5] . Studies using an RT-PCR targeting viral mRNA to detect FCoV replication suggest this situation to be the case as well in vivo [13, 28] ; actually, viral mRNA or infected cells could not be observed in organs other than the intestinal tract. Apparently, FECV is picked up by mononuclear cells in the gut and carried to organs and tissues with the blood. Consistently, while studying haemolymphatic tissues, a major site for the accumulation of monocytes/macrophages, Kipar et al. found significantly higher levels of viral RNA in cats with FIP than in healthy FCoV positive cats [17] . Moreover, FCoV antigen was detectable by immunohistology in these tissues only in FIP cats [17, 18] , confirming the low FECV replication activity in the mononuclear cells.",

In chronically infected animals the lower part of the gastrointestinal tract was identified as a major site of viral replication, as indicated by RT-PCR detection of viral mRNA and by immunohistochemical detection of infected cells [13] . Consistent with these findings, during experimentally established persistent infection we only observed FECV in the large intestine, downstream of the appendix, i.e. in colon and rectum. During the submission process of this manuscript a publication by Kipar et al. [19] appeared in which the colon was also identified as the major site of FCoV persistence.",

Here we studied two independent FECV strains isolated from cats many years apart and maintained by cat-to-cat passage only. Interestingly, the two viruses behaved reproducibly different, the UCD strain being consistently more pathogenic than the RM strain, also when applied to older kittens (data not shown). In both infection experiments with FECV RM the cats grew normally, remained without fever, produced normal stools and did not show obvious signs of disease. In contrast, the FECV UCD infected cats had diminished appetite and exhibited weight loss early after inoculation. Two of the cats developed chronic or recurrent fever, as observed also with another FECV isolate [21] .",
