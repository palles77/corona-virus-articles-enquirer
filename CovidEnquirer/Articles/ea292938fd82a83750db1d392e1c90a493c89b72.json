            "text": "We now have unequivocal evidence that the climate is changing, in the words of the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) published by the authoritative United Nations (UN) body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2007. AR4 sets out clearly mechanisms and causes of climate change and tells of a rapidly warming world. 1 IPCC 2007 projections for the rest of the century: Twenty of the hottest years ever measured occurring in the atmospheric record have come since 1980 and the 13 hottest have all occurred since 1990. The year on record was 2005, whilst all five of the hottest years ever recorded were in the past decade. The five hottest years in ascending order were: 2005, 1998, 2002, 2003, 2004 . The last 10 years, globally, has been the warmest decade in the last 100 years, and it is likely that the last century was the warmest in the last millennium. Sea level has risen by 250 mm (10 inches) since 1860. What we have measured before can be taken as certain but the science of predicting what will come in the future is by no means perfect. However, the science of AR4 tells of trends that cannot be ignored by the responsible and concerned citizens of the planet. Some claim that there are systemic errors in the reporting on the subject and the IPCC, as an inevitable consequence of requiring political and scientific consensus, does come down on the side of cautious conservatism rather than the opposite. Other first class scientists are more forthright.",

Professor Bob Watson, chief scientific officer for the UK Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), spoke to the press on 7 August 2008 after the publication of a two and a half year analysis by the UK Foresight programme, and said that he thought we should now plan to adapt to temperature rises of up to 4\u00b0C. Sir David King, the former chief scientific officer to the UK Government, concurred with these findings, pointing out that there is now a 20% risk that we may reach these temperatures and that if we do it may well push up over dangerous climate tipping points resulting in knock-on effects such as the release of the methane hydrate deposits in the Arctic.",

Thinking through the implications of 4 degrees of warming shows that the impacts are so significant that the only real adaptation strategy is to avoid that at all cost because of the pain and suffering that it is going to cost. There is no science on how we are going to adapt to 4 degrees warming. It is actually pretty alarming. 2 This comes after the seminal paper by James Hansen et al., entitled: 'Target atmospheric CO 2 : where should humanity aim?' In it he and his co-researchers conclude that if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization developed and to which life on Earth is adapted, palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) will need to be reduced from its current 385 ppm to at most 350 ppm. The largest uncertainty in the target arises from possible changes in non-CO 2 forcing like the methane released from the melting tundra. An initial 350 ppm CO 2 target may be achievable by phasing out coal use except where CO 2 is captured and adopting agricultural and forestry practices that sequester carbon. If the present overshoot of this target CO 2 is not brief, there is a possibility of seeding irreversible catastrophic effects.",

Source: IPCC 3rd Assessment Report. 3 Commonly published and cited sources show that predicted temperature changes vary significantly according to which scenario is adopted and also on a region by region basis. The best data we have in the UK to date are those of the UK Climate Impacts Programme scenarios (UKCIP02), which predict that average annual temperatures across the UK may rise between 2 and 3.5\u00b0C by the 2080s, depending on the scenario. In general, there will be greater warming in the southeast than the northwest and there may be more warming in summer and autumn than in winter and spring, a prediction that seems to have been leant credence by the hot summer and warm autumn of 2003. 4 Under the High Emissions scenario, the southeast may be up to an astonishing 5\u00b0C warmer in the summer by the 2080s. During the last Ice Age, only 10 000 years ago, temperatures were only just over 3\u00b0C colder than today, so who knows what such predictions for future climates hold in store for our children and grandchildren in terms of actual climate extremes.",

So, for example, warmer nights mean that special care will have to be given to the environmental conditions in bedrooms. Another design problem relates to west-facing rooms with windows facing the low western sun when the ambient temperatures are at their highest in the afternoon so combining incoming sun with higher air temperatures. A further consideration, that will considerably worsen future climates, particularly in London, is that of the urban heat island effect, 5 which makes the centres of heavily built-up areas warmer than their hinterlands. Heat islands are very much influenced by: l The amount of building there is in a neighbourhood. This influences how much heat they can store in a day, week, month or season.

In London in 2003, even in more traditional offices temperatures were exceeding these limits. It was also suggested that more breaks and a more relaxed dress code would help considerably. One employment lawyer suggested that employers should think twice before sacking staff who walk out of their workplace because of the heat, as they may find themselves accused of unfair dismissal. Workers can protect their work conditions by local negotiation covering the provision of air-cooling systems, shading for windows and an adequate supply of drinkable water. 6 Problems of poor internal climates are exacerbated by poor climatic design of buildings and their services. This was emphasized by all the staff of the refurbished HM Treasury building in London (July 2003), who were sent home after lunch because the building was simply too hot to occupy. It is unclear whether this was the fault of the designer of the refurbishment, the service engineers or the construction firm that did not properly commission the air conditioning system, but as temperatures increase designers will have to learn how to design and manage to avoid such overheating. 7 The need to put the building occupiers back into the equation of what makes an adequate building has made people more interested in the process of post-occupancy evaluation of building performance to ensure that lessons are properly learnt from such failures. 8 Since then there has been considerable work done on how to reduce overheating in the workplace and at home, and an excellent document one can view online is 'Beating the Heat' by Jake Hacker and a team funded by UKCIP. 9 This report shows the clear advantage of ventilation overheating in UK summertime temperatures.",

Members of the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, many of whom work for local councils, raised the alarm because they believe that sunbeds are contributing to the rise in the incidence of skin cancer. Research published by the Journal of the National Cancer Institute in 2002 shows a strong link between tanning lamps and skin cancer. They called, in their 2003 annual conference, for the inclusion of 'shade provision' to become a requirement for all big planning developments. School playgrounds would be required to provide children and teachers with shaded areas. 11 Surprisingly, skin cancer is actually a major problem in the UK and exposure to ultraviolet rays and direct strong sunlight increases the risk of contracting skin cancer, by damaging the immune system and causing premature ageing of the skin. Skin cancer is now the second most common form of cancer in the UK. There are 40 000 cases a year and the number of new cases annually rose by more than 90% in the 15 years between 1974 and 1989. Three-quarters of these result from malignant melanoma. Most skin cancers are not life-threatening but must be promptly removed surgically to avoid serious problems.",

In August 2003, it was announced that, in the drive to meet the ever-increasing demand in America for energy, around 50% of which goes to power buildings, the Bush Administration opened a huge loophole in America's air pollution laws allowing an estimated 17 000 outdated power stations and factories to increase their carbon emissions with immunity. Critics of the draft regulations unveiled by the US Environmental Protection Agency claimed they amounted to the death knell for the Clean Air Act, the centrepiece of US Environmental Regulations. The proposed new Regulations were challenged by 13 states, including New York, but if adopted would provide a multi-million dollar victory for US energy corporations. Many of the objectors are particularly concerned about the health impacts of this loophole on the cities and populations in the vicinity of such plants. 20 In Britain the Labour government has been very open about its desire to promote the interest of the aviation industry, with well-publicized plans for three major new airport developments over the next decade, at the expense of the well-being of ordinary citizens, particularly in southeast England. 21 Cheap air travel has a bread and circuses ring to it that appeals to politicians seeking re-election, but all political parties have possibly underestimated the intelligence of the local voters and their levels of knowledge on the issues involved.

There are growing fears that human-made pollution is producing 'dead zones' caused by critically low oxygen levels in the oceans of the world. By 2007 over 400 coastal dead zones were recorded, up from 300 in 1995 and 162 in the late 1980s. Dead zones are caused when massive algal blooms, feeding off pollutants such as fertilizers, die and decay. Marine bacteria feed on the algae in the blooms after they have sunk to the bottom, and use up much of the oxygen dissolved in the water. The resulting 'hypoxic' seabeds can asphyxiate seabed organisms like clams and worms, and in turn disrupt fish stock. The problem can be exacerbated by periods of heavy rain that flush out more of the chemical pollutants in the soils, into the streams and rivers and down into the sea.",

For example, with warmer outdoor temperatures, the growth of the 'caf\u00e9 society' may increase activity at all times of year in the streets of cities, and sensible planning of open-air eating facilities in relation to residential areas is necessary as the warmer evenings may well pre-date the adaptation of populations to higher street noise levels. Thought should also be given to the greater need to open windows in warmer weather and the need to ensure that the noise and pollution impacts of street life and traffic noise do not encourage a move towards the climatically unnecessary air conditioning of buildings. The increased need for traffic-free zones in open restaurant areas of a city may become a feature of future inner city planning strategies, to ensure that local office buildings can be naturally ventilated without excessive noise levels. So noise and pollution should be increasingly included as key concerns for urban designers and local councils alike. Even fashionable buildings on sites with high noise and traffic pollution levels are problems, like the \u00a313 million Hammersmith Ark building. It is nearly three decades old, very elegant, with low rents per square foot, but because of its noisy location on a traffic island, it has proved over those years a challenge to rent out. fires Fire hazards are significantly increased with hotter dry seasons, which add to the frequency, and the intensity, of bush and forest fires, creating a greater hazard to life, limb and property. Such fires occur generally in association with extreme dry periods and strong winds, as was the case with the Great Fire of London in 1666. 26 Every month from November 1665 to September 1666 was dry. By August 1666, the River Thames at Oxford was reduced to a 'trickle'. The dryness extended to Scotland, at least from May to mid-July. The drought over these two months is noteworthy because it preceded the Great Fire of London, and apparently the east wind, which prevailed during that period, had dried the wooden houses of London until they were like tinder. When the fire started on 12 September, the east wind drove the flames before it, causing great problems with fire-fighting and helping the fire to spread rapidly, causing smoke from the fire to reach as far as Oxford.",

Sixteen per cent of all coral reefs globally were calculated to have been destroyed but the worst affected were those in the Indian Ocean.

The animals are drawn to feed off rubbish bins, a particular problem in the USA where, because of urban sprawl, the suburbs are moving into what was wilderness. Animal numbers have risen owing to restrictive laws in some states on the hunting and trapping of a range of larger animals, for instance lynx, bobcats, bears, beavers, foxes, wolves and cougars. There are black bears in the suburbs of Boston for the first time in 200 years and in New Jersey they have multiplied to over an estimated 3300. In December 2003 New Jersey authorized its first bear hunt in 33 years. Coyotes are multiplying too, and their cheek was demonstrated when one ran into the federal building in Seattle, through reception and into the lift! They routinely eat cats and dogs. In Florida the alligator population is growing at an unprecedented rate, helped by people buying up large plots and embracing the wilderness life and feeding the animals. David Baron maintains that the USA (and humans in general, the most pervasive species of all) is engaged in a grand and largely unintentional experiment.

The mountain was closed in August 2003, with its naked slopes covered with heaps of rubble and scree. Two climbers died just trying to get to the restaurant at the start of the climbing routes. The permafrost that holds the mountain peaks together had melted to a depth of 7 feet (2.1 m), making ski lifts and cable cars unstable. The problems became apparent in July 2003, when an enormous rock avalanche hurtled down the mountain's east face, and within two hours another rocked the north face. More than 70 climbers had to be hauled from the mountain, one of the biggest mountaineering rescues in history. The mountain had actually begun to fall apart under their feet. Ice as it warms, but before it melts, may be more unstable than when it is turning to water. There is a growing realization that there is going to be a lot more of this type of devastation in mountainous regions as the foundations of the mountains, and their ski lifts and cable cars, become unstable. 32 agriculture In 2008 a global food crisis broke upon an unsuspecting world. Hunger riots broke out from Haiti to Indonesia.

Prince Charles, in August 2008, made a controversial plea for humanity to turn away from the use of genetically modified crops because it put too much power in the hands of a few international corporations. What is increasingly apparent is that everyone from the lower and middle classes, in fact all but richest minority of the world's population, will have to turn their hands to growing or accessing as much of their own food locally as possible because of the growing cost of centrally provided food in the shops. Climate change is making food security as challenging an issue as that of energy security. For both these key challenges local storage solutions offer the individual more hope of survival in all but the most extreme of catastrophes. A local saying in the city of Mosul in northern Iraq is 'One day honey, one day onions', meaning one day plenty, one day basic rations. Every family should plan, perhaps, to locate their own stash of onions in a rapidly changing world.",

Plants such as tender perennials did not feature and there were very few cacti to be seen. There were two future scenarios including a 'low emissions' and a 'high emissions' garden. The former had plants that can be grown in sheltered positions in today's gardens but the latter was populated with species that one would find in Mediterranean gardens today such as bougainvillea, succulents and a wide range of drought-resistant species.",

            "text": "Plants, like humans and other animals, are being influenced by the changing climate. In even the hottest and driest places on Earth the garden has always been an important climatic design feature, to enhance the enjoyment of life, through the richness of colour and texture, perfumes and appearance, but also a very effective way of providing cooling. The earliest dynasties of Mesopotamia were renowned for their gardens. The Garden of Eden was placed by historians at the confluence of the Tigris and the Euphrates and the poetry of the Sumerians, living over 5000 years ago in that region, lyrically details the beauty of the trees, plants and flowers enjoyed at the time. Most have also heard of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and many will have read the rich poetry of the Persians, singing tributes to the beauty of the gardens and their contents with ponds and streams set, in an ordered fashion, in the great walled domains and parks. 35 On such a great tradition of gardening were built the Roman gardens, as one can see today in Pompeii, where many have been reconstructed from the archaeological evidence garnered from the uncovered city. Vines and fruit trees, woods and flowers and herbs flourish, still reflecting the wall paintings around the houses. 36 The secret of the success of gardening in some of the hottest places on Earth was to create a micro-climate fed by very selective watering systems and strategies and protected from the barren deserts beyond by high walls that kept out the hot winds and sun and contained the moister micro-climate within. Cold and moist air sinks, and many such gardens contain sunken sections, often covered by a canopy of trees to reduce evaporative transpiration rates and contain the coolth. Perhaps the greatest achievement of any urban gardeners is in the Chinese Desert Oasis city of Turfan, where the main crop of the town, grapes, is also used as an air conditioning system for the whole city: all the pavements and courtyards of houses in the old city are planted with vines that keep out the sun and provide a luxurious micro-climate beneath the vines. Other strategies for gardening in deserts include the planting of only drought-tolerant species and minimizing water loss rates by very careful diurnal and seasonal strategies for planting, watering and harvesting species. 37 Just as we will rely increasingly on imported wisdom on appropriate building technologies as the climate warms, as traditional approaches to gardening cease to be viable in future climates, with drier and hotter summers and frost-free winters, many of the lower latitude approaches to garden design and upkeep will have to be incorporated into our strategies for maintaining gardens. Many of the species in British gardens today may have to be replaced in the future by more drought-tolerant plants, and for inspiration a good place to look for species appropriate to future climates in the UK is to the gardens of southern Europe today. 38 tHe proBlems of freeze Increasingly, extreme weather events are associated not only with higher temperatures but also with the problems of freeze. Extreme cold events cause real challenges for many homes. The 'big freeze' of December 1995 and January 1996 caused widespread damage from burst pipes and water mains. The evidence submitted by the Scottish and Northern Ireland Plumbing Employer's Federation to the subsequent Scottish Affairs Committee Inquiry 39 highlighted the concern that many householders did not know how to or could not shut off the cold water supply. Many flats and tenements had no isolation valve for individual properties. The scale of burst 3.10.",

The fire began to 'crown', moving rapidly from tree top to tree top, and was seen to leap from building to building, some of which exploded in the intense heat. The fire started on 16 August with a lightning strike in the mountains. l September 2003: On the French Riviera, huge forest fires destroyed over 1000 hectares of woods, following two devastating blazes in July that killed four people, including two Britons, and destroyed more than 18 000 hectares of pine and oak. l October 2003: The final death toll in the southern Californian fires of October 2003 rose to over 22, including some of the 12 000 fire-fighters who battled with the blazes.
