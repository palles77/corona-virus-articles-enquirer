            "text": "The Golgi apparatus-complex (GA), is a key organelle involved in several posttranslational modifications of polypeptides destined for lysosomes, plasma membranes and secretion. As reported from this laboratory, certain astrocytes in rat brain contain cisternae of the GA not only in perikarya, but also in processes. In order to further investigate which type of astrocytes contain GA in processes we conducted the present study using primary cultures of rat astrocytes and organelle specific antibodies against the GA and the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). While the perikarya of all cells contained elements of the GA, only a single process of a subset of type I astrocytes, negative to antibodies A2B5 and HNK-1, contained GA. In contrast, elements of the RER were found within perikarya and all processes. In order to confirm that the immunostained structures in processes indeed represent the GA, we exposed cultures to Brefeldin A (BFA), a secretion blocker which disperses the GA and redistributes it to the RER. We observed that BFA disrupted the GA of both perikarya and processes. However, astrocytes were resistant to prolonged incubations with BFA, while a similar treatment killed cultured fibroblasts and PC-12 cells. Furthermore, in astrocytes exposed to BFA for several days, the delicate network of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), was replaced by large perinuclear masses of the protein. These observations demonstrate that a subset of type I astrocytes have a single process with elements of the GA. We suggest that this specialization of the GA may be related to yet unrecognized secretory or protein processing functions of these cells. The resistance of astrocytes to BFA and the striking changes in their cytoskeleton induced by the drug, may contribute to studies on the mechanism(s) of action of BFA.",

The organelle is involved in numerous posttranslational modifications and in the sorting or targetting of processed polypeptides. In addition to the general properties of the organelle, cell specific features of the GA, such as selective production of certain enzymes (e.g. high PAPS cerebroside sulfontransferase in neuronal GA), have been identified [3, 22, 36, 39, 40, 49, 62] . Astrocytes are actively involved in numerous secretory functions such as production of cytokines and growth factors [24, 25, 46] . It is therefore reasonable to speculate that the GA of astrocytes would express function-related properties of the GA.",

In tissue sections, astrocytes can be divided by morphological criteria into 'fibrous' (mostly in the white matter) and 'protoplasmic' (mostly in the gray matter). Additional markers such as the monoclonal antibody A2B5 [15] and tetanus toxin are positive in cultures of astrocytes with numerous delicate branching processes (type II) and negative in flat astrocytes (type I) [58] . Additional evidence suggests a dual lineage of the two types of astrocytes in some culture systems [44, 59] . Type I astrocytes and their processes envelop blood vessels, suggesting a function related to the blood brain barrier (BBB); also, type I astrocytes proliferate in response to injury, while type II astrocytes are associated with the nodes of Ranvier and die in response to axonal injury [52] . There is no clear parallel between the in vivo and in vitro classifications of astrocytes. Moreover, there is some question as to whether or not type II astrocytes have an in vivo analogue [53] . Astrocyte heterogeneity has been reported even within a morphologically distinct group, particularly for type I astrocytes cultures [74] . This includes heterogeneity in ion channel, expression of neurotransmitter receptor and glycoprotein, neuropeptide and cytoskeletal content, prostaglandin and peptide secretion, influence on neuronal differentiation, as well as morphology [4, 29, 45, 51, 74] .",

In this laboratory an intrinsic membrane sia[oglycoprotein (MG-160) of medial cisternae of the GA, was purified from rat brains [26] . The original monoclonal antibody, 10A8, used in the isolation of MG-160 from rat brains, reacts only with rat tissues. However, a polyclonal antiserum raised against immunoaffinity purified MG-160 reacts with several species and cell types, including human [11] , suggesting that MG-160 or closely related molecules are conserved polypeptides of the GA.",

Other glial cells did not display extensions of the GA in processes. This localization of the GA in processes of astrocytes, and the investigation of other structural properties of the GA of astrocytes is the subject of the present study. In this study in order to further investigate the properties of elements of a putative GA in astrocytic processes, we used primary cultures of astrocytes and the organelle specific antisera against the GA and the RER [8, 11, 26] . The primary culture model offers the opportunity of experimental manipulations and better resolution of immunocytochemical staining, not easily obtainable in in vivo studies. To further ascertain whether immunostained elements indeed represented the GA, we exposed cultures to BFA, a secretion blocker, which disrupts the GA and induces its redistribution into the RER [12, 47] . Results of this study indicate that processes of a subpopulation of astrocytes display elements of the GA in a polarized fashion.",

To confirm that cells which expressed MG-160 in processes were astrocytes, double-labeling immunofluorescence with anti-MG-160 and astrocytic-specific intermediate filament marker (GFAP) antibodies were performed. All cells with staining of the GA in processes were GFAP positive (Fig. 3A,B ).",

Immunoperoxidase staining for MG-160 of cultures maintained in BFA for 72 h revealed that the effect of the drug on the dispersion of the GA was still present in all surviving cells similar to the effect after 24 h (Fig. 6) . To analyze the nature of surviving cells under BFA, double-labeling by immunofluorescence was performed 48 h after the initial introduction of BFA (1 /zg/ml) into the medium. All cells showed the BFA effect on the GA as expressed by a diffuse granular MG-160 staining. The majority of cells were GFAP positive, although occasional GFAP negative flat cells with abundant cytoplasm (presumably macrophage/microglia cells) were also present. Occasional HNK-1 positive cells were present. Thus both type I and type II astrocytes resisted the prolonged BFA treatment.",

            "text": "The present study demonstrates several unique structural features of the GA of astrocytes. There is a unique polarization and distribution of the GA in processes of a subset of type I astrocytes. Thus, a subpopulation of type I astrocytes exhibit a polarized cell process similar to the axons and dendrites in neurons. These astrocytic processes contain elements of the GA as dendrites do. However, unlike the polarized nature of neuronal processes, which may be recognized with a Nissl stain and do not require organelle specific stains, the recognition of the polarized nature of astrocytic processes requires immunohistochemical staining for the GA. Additional support for the existence of polarity in astrocytic processes is derived from the report of specific distribution of sodium ion channels in astrocytic processes. Astrocyte processes forming the glial limitans and surrounding blood vessels display reduced immunoreactivity for a sodium channel specific protein, compared to longitudinally oriented or perinodal astrocytic processes, while focal regions of the glial limitans exhibit robust immunostaining [5] . The finding of increased density of potassium ion channals in the endfeet of astrocytic processes [56] provides further support for the possibility that astrocytic processes are actively involved in specialized functions. The subset of astrocytes with a polarized process may be involved in specialized secretory functions requiring rapid exchange of secretory products with the environment adjacent to this specialized cell process. It has been suggested that the GA plays a major role in cell motility [38] , and that polarization of the GA in motile cells serves as a steering mechanism in the direction of cell migration [37] . Therefore type I astrocytes with polarized GA may belong to a subpopulation of astrocytes that are motile and capable of migration in response to injury. Taken together the above evidence strongly suggests that the polarization of the GA in certain cells is not a random and insignificant phenomenon. However, the functional significance of the polarization of the GA in astrocytes remains to be investigated. The differential expression of GA in processes in the two distinct astrocytic types further emphasizes the hypothesis that functional, anatomical, and morphological differences separate these two cells which express the same intermediate filaments (GFAP). Furthermore it provides further evidence of the heterogeneity that exists among type I astrocytes.",
