Given the major role that RNA processing plays in disease and normal biology, it is crucial to ascertain the existence of novel isoforms and to accurately quantify their abundance. Second generation RNA-seq technologies such as Illumina are well suited to the tasks of assessing gene expression levels and determining proximal exon connectivity. They produce numerous sequencing reads at a low cost ensuring sufficient representation of most transcripts. However, because the RNA or cDNA is fragmented during short RNA-seq protocols, long range connectivity can only be computationally inferred. These predictions based on short reads struggle to correctly identify transcript isoforms that contain multiple alternative exons (7) or that contain retained introns (8, 9) . In these cases, long-read (LR) sequencing technologies are invaluable because they can sequence entire molecules in one pass and thus capture long-range connectivity of complex isoforms.",

Therefore, they may not be suitable for transcriptome and single cell datasets where isoform representation may vary considerably. In the second approach (28) (29) (30) (31) , short reads are considered as the fragments of a reference transcriptome, and roughly assembled using a graph structure, onto which long reads are aligned (32) . However, sequencing errors in SR datasets, complex transcript architectures and sequence duplicates often lead to extremely complex graph structures (33, 34 ) that elicit graph simplifications or exploration heuristics to keep computations tractable. Most hybrid correction algorithms were primarily intended to be applied to genomic data with the aim to improve the quality of genome assemblies. As such, they typically rely on assumptions that fit DNA-seq data properties and thus a linear reference genome. According to this, bifurcation nodes and tips (dead-ends in the graph) are assumed to originate mainly from sequencing errors and not transcript processing events. In addition, genome sequencing benefits from a relatively uniform read coverage and therefore the graph is simplified by discarding a priori all nodes whose count is below a user-defined threshold. The fact that these approaches are not adapted for RNA-seq data have been extensively discussed in previous works on transcript assembly (34) and short read correction (35, 36) and their impact on long read correction can be easily anticipated. RNA-seq data display highly uneven coverage, even across a same genomic location, thus the frequency of sequencing errors varies depending on the surrounding coverage depth. Tips may correspond to the start or end of a transcript and finally specific regions such as 3' ends of transcripts, are frequently under covered.",

TALC considers transcript expression and the existence of isoforms to correct LRs. For the purpose of testing TALC, we generated Oxford Nanopore direct RNA sequencing reads and Illumina short reads on an MCF10A human cell line and downloaded LR and SR data from the GM12878 human cell line and a Spike-In experiment. We demonstrate that after TALC correction, long reads map with higher sequence identity and with less errors in exon assembly than currently used methods. The gains observed following TALC were tested on simulated long reads as well as on real reads. Figure 1 illustrates the methodology behind TALC and highlights how it considers transcript abundance and architecture to correct long reads. The first step of TALC graph-based procedure is to consider short reads as a raw reference transcriptome by merging them through a weighted De-Bruijn Graph (DBG) structure (28, 32) , whose nodes represent k-mers. For each node, we record their k-mer abundance in the SR dataset. Thus, any sequence of transcripts expressed in the RNA-seq sample should appear as a unique path of the graph. The long read is corrected by finding the right sequence of nodes to which it corresponds in the DBG built from short reads. Paths corresponding to true transcripts should display consistent k-mer coverage except in regions where the existence of multiple isoforms may alter the coverage such as at splice junctions ( Figure 2) . We thus propose a method of graph exploration that considers k-mer count variation consistent with transcript abundance and isoform existence (adaptive count thresholding).",

Finally, borders of transcripts suffer from higher sequencing bias in short reads (notably in 3' ends of transcripts). The two last points make k-mer coverage more erratic and over dispersed.

For example, a correction method that would simply replace a LR by a known transcript sequence to which it was most similar could obtain a high percentage of mapped reads and low error rates but would not correctly represent the sequenced transcriptome. Thus, to further evaluate the 7 correction methods in this paper, we computed two sets of transcriptome-specific indicators which are directed towards the two major applications of RNA-seq experiments: transcript-level quantification (11, 47) and isoform recovery (12) . For this we considered two types of data: a real ERCC Spike-In dataset and two simulated LR data mimicking the real MCF10A and GM12878 experiments. ERCC Spike-In data have known theoretical concentrations from which we could gauge how each correction method would impact transcript counts accuracy. Simulated LRs datasets mimicking the real MCF10A and GM12878 datasets both in terms of error-model and transcript-level expression (cf: Supplementary Material) allows us to extend our observations on ERCC data to more complex transcriptomes. Importantly, it gives us insight into the capacity of a hybrid corrector to preserve and clarify transcript structure at the read resolution. For measuring the impact of correction on structure and transcript assembly accuracies, we computed the proportion of (simulated) long reads whose transcript structure could be correctly elucidated by aligners and their ability to preserve true exon connectivity and to improve false ones (cf : Tables 2A and 2B) .

We chose Minimap2 and GraphMap as they were specifically designed for long mRNA reads and GMAP because it was considered the best splice-aware aligner for long RNA data according to a recent benchmark (48) . TALC shows consistently high mapping numbers regardless of the aligner used. It's closest competitor in this aspect, LoRDEC, has a high number of mapped reads with Minimap2 and GMAP but this drops to the lowest number of all methods with GraphMap. We noticed a similar trend at the gene-level assessment where LoRDEC correctly associated LRs with their gene of origin when Minimap2 or GMAP were used but was one of the worst performers with GraphMap (Supplementary Table 2A ). This can be explained by the rather high mismatch rate that remains after LoRDEC correction (partly due to the insertion of false SNPs from SRs sequencing errors, Supplementary Table 1C) .",

We developed a method to systematically identify these errors ( Figure 3B and Supplementary Material) and evaluated the impact of LR correction methods on them.

The authors of (47) tested several strategies to assess whether Nanopore data were fit for quantification. We reproduced their approaches based on Salmon (Salmon quasi-mapping). When splice-aware genome alignment was applicable, we also tested the approach Minimap2+Salmon. For comparison, we added a third approach, independent of Salmon, and simply based on GraphMap transcript assignments. Quantitation was realised on real Spike-In data (transcript-level) and on simulated datasets (gene-level and transcript-level). On simulated data, this analysis suggests that read correction results in a significant overall improvement of gene-level quantification accuracy (cf: Supplementary Table 2A ), all correction methods providing a rather similar gain in accuracy. This observation seems to hold also at the transcript-level, when using Salmon quasi-mapping mode, both on simulated datasets (Supplementary Table 2B ) and real Spike-In data (cf: Table 3 ). But, surprisingly, a prior alignment step (using either Minimap2 or GraphMap) seem to level the estimates.",

We computed the proportion of exons that were correctly mapped (%Identified), and the fraction of full-length LRs for which all exons could be accurately identified (error-free structure). The set of exons that could be evaluated varies between tools as it depends on the reads that could be mapped to the correct gene of origin.

To extract anchor points from the solid regions TALC will first crop background noise that frequently surround solid regions (red cross). The second step in determining anchors is to search for sudden changes in coverage within a solid region.

Analysis on simulated data indicates it can fairly improve the reoncstruction of the inner body of transcrits. Nonetheless, it lacks a specific strategy to stop correction at the borders, and has a marked tendency to extend reads. This feature, though relevant for genome assembly, can be detrimental on RNA-seq data when the corrected read originates from a gene which expressed multiple UTR forms or undergoes alternative transcription start and end.Consistent with conclusions from(42), LoRDEC demonstrates very good results on most the transcriptomespecific indicators. Its main drawback is a lower base accuracy due to the inclusion of many sequencing errors from the SRs into the LRs, especially across high SR coverage regions. Additionally, it's performances vary dramatically between aligners.",

The program is freely available under the CECILL licence in the GitLab repository (https://gitlab.igh.cnrs.fr/lbroseus/TALC). Currently, the De Bruijn graph is built from k-mer counts files as output by Jellyfish2 (67). https://gitlab.igh.cnrs.fr/lbroseus/TransAT. Direct RNA Nanopore and Illumina RNA-seq MCF10A samples have been deposited on GEO under accession number GSE126638. LB developed and implemented the algorithm. LB and WR devised the analyses and planned the experiments. AT provided valuable suggestions for the implementation. AJO cultured MCF10A cells and extracted their RNA. DS carried out the sequencing, and ED performed the base calling of the MiNION sample. LB and WR wrote the article. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.We wish to acknowledge the Genotoul platform (genotoul.fr) for providing us with calculation time on their servers.",
