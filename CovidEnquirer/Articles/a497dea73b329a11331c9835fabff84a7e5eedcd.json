Microarray assay showed the mRNA expressions of genes related to non-specific cellarer immune and cytokines were significantly down-regulated. Abnormal expressions of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, NK marker CD16+56+, CD19 and aberrant CD4+/CD8+ ratio were detected in 54 among 56 patients. In PE patients, microarray assay revealed the imbalance in the expressions of genes related to the immune system. The expressions of genes related to non-specific immune cells and cytokines were markedly up-regulated and those associated with cellular immune were dramatically down-regulated. In VTE patients, cytological examination indicated the functions of NK cells were significantly compromised, and the antigen recognition and killing function of T cells markedly decreased. The consistence between genomic and cytological examination suggests the symptomatic VTE is closely associated with the infection and immune dysfunction.",

The high morbidity, high misdiagnosis rate and high mortality render PE as a worldwide health problem (1) . In 1965, Egeberg et al first described a parentage with inherited antithrombin deficiency, a member of which repeatedly developed DVT. The antithrombin deficiency is an autosomal dominant genetic disease and they first proposed the concept of thrombophilia (2) . However, evidence on the genetic pathogenesis of VTE is rarely identified in a majority of VTE patients (3) . According to the pathogenesis, VTE is classified into genetic VTE and acquired VTE which is frequently found in clinical practice. The symptomatic VTE is an entity of hereditary VTE and acquired VTE.",

In 2011, we reported the decreased CD3 + and CD8 + level with an increased CD4 + /CD8 + ratio in a group of CTEPH patients, suggesting T cellular immune dysfunction and ratio imbalance in CTEPH patients (11) . In the present study, the whole human genome microarray and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis were employed to detect the targeting of symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE). In addition, flow cytometry was performed to investigate the changes in immune cells in VTE patients, which aimed to validate the results from genome analysis. Based on the findings above, the relationship between immune dysfunction and clinical symptomatic VTE was analyzed. The CPR level in part of VTE inpatients was determined.",
