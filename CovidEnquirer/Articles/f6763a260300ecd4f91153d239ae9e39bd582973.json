            "text": "Extensive antigenic variation is a feature of IBV and new serotypes, based on neutralization tests, have been detected frequently (Cook and Huggins, 1986) . Only recently has the molecular basis for this variation been sought. Most attention has been focused on the spike glycoprotein (S), the major inducer of neutralizing antibody (Cavanagh et al., 1984 (Cavanagh et al., , 1986a , which is a highly glycosylated protein of approximately 1160 amino acids which is cleaved into two glycopolypeptides, Sl and S2, of about 520 and 625 residues, respectively (Binns et al., 1985; Cavanagh et al., 1986b) . Sl and S2 are derived from the amino-(N-) and carboxy-halves of the precursor polypeptide, respectively. Cloning and sequencing of the S gene of a number of serotypes have revealed that amino acid differences between them occur twice as frequently in Sl than in S2 (Binns et al., 1985 (Binns et al., , 1986 Niesters et al., 1986; Niesters, 1987) . Experimental proof that S2 anchors S in the membrane has led to the suggestion that the distal part of S is formed largely by Sl. These observations, considered with the findings that two neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) reacted with Sl (Mockett et al., 1984) and that urea-released Sl can induce neutralizing antibody (Cavanagh et al., 1986a) show that the multimeric Sl subunit of S (Cavanagh, 1983 ) is a major inducer of neutralizing antibody.",

Circumstantial evidence that HVRs 1 and 2 have significance with respect to serotype-specific antibody has been produced by Niesters (1987) who showed that some IBV serotypes differed by as few as 7 amino acids and that 5 of these differences were within HVRs 1 and 2. To examine further these HVRs and to establish the extent of variation within a single serotype we have sequenced part of the S gene of nine additional Mass strains. The most widely used vaccines have been developed from strains of this serotype. We have also sequenced variants which escaped neutralization by two MAbs and show that the mutation lies within HVR 1.",

After 3 days the fluid in those tubes showing ciliostasis at the limiting dilution was harvested. One hundred microlitre volumes were mixed with 100 ~1 of MAb diluted l/5 and the virus was titrated. After a further 3 days the limiting dilution tubes were harvested and the titer of the virus amplified by growing in embryonated eggs. Five clones of variant virus (vA38) selected in this way were chosen and shown to be resistant to neutralization by MAb A38 but not by polyclonal antiserum to IBV-M41. Two attempts to select variants in this way using MAb Al3 were unsuccessful; all virus was neutralized. A successful attempt was made to isolate variants to this MAb by mutagenising virus with nitrous acid, essentially as described by Scheid and Choppin (1976) followed by a selection procedure similar to that described for MAb A38.",

The M41 sequence generated by reverse transcription of virion RNA was identical to that obtained from cloned M41 RNA (Binns et al., 1986 ) except at base 323 where we identified U (as did Niesters et al., 1986) instead of G. The nucleotide differences between M41 and the other Mass strains are shown in Table 1 , including differences from the Beaudette strain (Houghton variant) (Binns et al., 1985) . This strain, isolated in the USA in 1936, which has been passaged in embryonated eggs considerably more times than even vaccine strains, has also been adapted to growth in chick kidney cells and has been passaged in and handed on by several laboratories. Niesters et al. (1986) strains there were only 62 bases (4.0%) in Sl where one or more strains differed (Table 1 ). At the ammo acid level, and again excluding those 10 positions at which only Beaudette varied, there were differences at 32 (6.2%) of residues (Fig. 1) . Niesters et al. (1986) observed that when the S sequence of the M41 and Beaudette strains were compared there were two regions in Sl where amino acid differences were concentrated. These h~e~a~able regions (HVRs 1 and 2) are at amino acid positions 38-51 and 99-115 in Fig. 1 . Our results for Sl of six additional strains, plus partial sequence for two others, shows that at most residues within HVRs 1 and 2 strains resembled either Beaudette or M41.",

Three other clones of vA38 were sequenced in this region; the same base difference was detected. After nitrous acid treatment a variant resistant to MAb Al3 was obtained. Sequencing of all of the Sl part of the gene of two clones of variant showed only one nucleotide difference, the same as that obtained with MAb A38. It may, therefore, have been merely fortuitous that a variant to MA\\, Al3 was obtained after but not before nitrous acid treatment. As anticipated vA38 was resistant to neutralization by MAb A13. Of the 9 Mass strains sequenced 6 (M41, H52, H120, MM, VF69/149 and HVI-140) have been treated with MAbs A38 and A13; only M41 was neutralized (Mockett et al., 1984) .

Taken together these observations indicate that IBV evolution is complex. Thus, IBV may exhibit antigenic drift, a small number of amino acid changes resulting in a change of serotype, but without one serotype necessarily displacing others.",

H52 and H120 are of particular interest not merely because they are widely used but because they differ in virulence (Mac-Donald and McMartin, 1976) .

            "text": "However, our sequencing of MAb-resistant variants shows that some residues within HVR 1 are associated with epitopes that induce neutralizing antibody, the basis of IBV serotyping. HVRs 1 and 2 are not associated with the major hydrophilic domains indicated by the hydropathicity profile of S (Binns et al., 1985) . However, that HVR 1 has a surface location is indicated by our results which suggest that it induces antibody and show that it is associated with several serine residues which are usually found at protein surfaces (Schulz and Schirmer, 1979) . Interestingly, HVR 1 is also associated with several glycine residues which confer flexibility to polypeptide chains (Schulz and Schirmer, 1979) . While there is some dispute as to the relative importance for antigenicity of the accessibility and flexibility of an amino acid sequence there is agreement that surface exposure and flexibility are strongly correlated (Novotny et al., 1987; van Regenmortel, 1987) . The existence of HVRs 1 and 2 was first intimated following a comparison of the S genes of the M41 and Beaudette isolates (Niesters et al., 1986) . However, as discussed above, Beaudette has had a chequered history in laboratories, during which time variation occurred. Our analysis of many Mass serotype strains with much simpler passage histories does, however, support the proposal that amino acid sequences 38-51 and 99-115 are hypervariable regions. Interestingly, within HVRs 1 and 2 the bases of each strain were mostly like either M41 or Beaudette. Indeed, although the Houghton and Salk strains of Beaudette differed at 8 amino acid residues in Sl (Niesters et al., 1986) at 7 of these residues either the Houghton or Salk strain was the same as M41. Although there is no evidence as to the immunogenicity of HVR 2 our current results indicate that within HVRs 1 and 2 there appears to be a limit to the variation which is compatible with retention of the Mass serotype. Circumstantial evidence that both HVRs 1 and 2 have significance with respect to serotype-specific antibody has been produced by Niesters (1987) who showed that some IBV serotypes differed by as few as 7 amino acids and that 5 of these were within HVRs 1 and 2. This suggests that in some cases a very small number of critical amino acid changes are sufficient to alter antigenicity greatly. This simple view may not, however, apply in all cases. Thus, the Sl sequence of two strains of the same serotype (D1466 and D212) differed at 50% of the amino acid residues overall and at 22 of the 30 residues within HVRs 1 and 2 (Niesters, 1987) . This observation, considered with our results showing substantial variation within HVRs 1 and 2 within a single serotype, suggests that residues without these two regions are also involved in epitopes which induce neutralizing antibody. Of the 32 places within Sl where there is amino acid variation (excluding differences unique to Beaudette), 19 were within the first 113 amino-terminal residues, an incidence five-fold greater than in the remainder of Sl. Comparisons of IBV strains 6/82 and M41 (Binns et al., 1986) , porcine transmissable gastroenteritis coronavirus and feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus (Jacobs et al., 1987) , and the A59 and JHM strains of MHV (Luytjes et al., 1987) have shown that amino acid variation within the spike protein is greatest within the amino-terminal region.",

Sequencing of six clones, shown by neutr~zation tests to be of the Mass serotype, revealed that they had identical Sl sequences. Strain VF69/149 had the same Sl nucleotide sequence as HV2.
