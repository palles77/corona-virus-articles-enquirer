            "text": "Objective: Immunodeficient patients are particularly vulnerable to neuroinvasive infections that can be challenging to diagnose. Metagenomic next generation sequencing can identify unusual or novel microbes and is therefore well suited for investigating the etiology of chronic meningoencephalitis in immunodeficient patients. Methods: We present the case of a 34-year-old man with X-linked agammaglobulinemia from Australia suffering from 3 years of meningoencephalitis that defied an etiologic diagnosis despite extensive conventional testing, including a brain biopsy. Metagenomic next generation sequencing of his cerebrospinal fluid and brain biopsy tissue was performed to identify a causative pathogen. Results: Sequences aligning to multiple Cache Valley virus genes were identified via metagenomic next generation sequencing. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry subsequently confirmed the presence of Cache Valley virus in the brain biopsy tissue. Interpretation: Cache Valley virus, a mosquito-borne orthobunyavirus, has only been identified in 3 immunocompetent North American patients with acute neuroinvasive disease. The reported severity ranges from a self-limiting meningitis to a rapidly fatal meningoencephalitis with multiorgan failure. The virus has never been known to cause a chronic systemic or neurologic infection in humans. Cache Valley virus has also never previously been detected on the Australian continent. Our research subject traveled to North and South Carolina and Michigan in the weeks prior to the onset of his illness. This report demonstrates that metagenomic next generation sequencing allows for unbiased pathogen identification, the early detection of emerging viruses as they spread to new locales, and the discovery of novel disease phenotypes. ANN NEUROL 2017; 82:105-114 O utbreaks of emerging and reemerging pathogens have stimulated international discussion about the most efficient means for improving early detection so that public and private resources can be mobilized quickly and efficiently to limit widespread transmission and treat affected patients. There is a growing consensus that an optimal surveillance regimen will (1) incorporate an unbiased approach to pathogen identification and (2) focus surveillance efforts on groups of people at high risk for unusual infections (eg, immunodeficient patients and people with relevant exposures). [1] [2] [3] An unbiased approach to pathogen identification is important because traditional candidate-based diagnostic tests essentially fail to identify novel and unusual pathogens, usually due to perceived rarity or exclusion from clinical consideration based on established geographical distribution. Global surveillance efforts need to be streamlined, because it is both time-consuming and costly for physicians to order many pathogen-specific tests for geographically and clinically novel organisms. Finally, in the modern era, when international travel has become so commonplace, the need for improved pathogen detection has become clear.",

The second visit, in the summer 3 months later, started in Raleigh, but also included a trip to Charleston, South Carolina, where the patient participated in tubing along the local river. It was during this nearly month-long trip that the patient complained of a mosquito bite to his traveling companion. Two weeks later, he traveled to East Lansing, Michigan. Upon returning home to Australia 3 weeks later, the patient fell ill within 2 days, with his parents reporting fatigue, anorexia, and lethargy. Six days later, the patient suffered an acute encephalitic illness characterized by fevers to 39 8C, confusion, and postictal drowsiness following 2 generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The patient was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit. Blood tests revealed lymphocytosis (23.3 3 10 9 /l, normal range [NR] 5 1.0-3.0 3 10 9 /l) and a C-reactive protein level of 17.9mg/l (NR 5mg/l). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies revealed normal concentrations of protein (32 mg/dl) and glucose (77 mg/dl), with 87 3 10 6 /l white blood cells (11% neutrophils, 38% lymphocytes, 51% monocytes) and 19 3 10 6 /l red blood cells. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed increased T2 signal and restricted diffusion through the right fornix, extending into the right hippocampus and amygdala (Fig 1A, B) with interval development of contrast enhancement in the same brain structures 2 weeks later (Fig 1C, D) . Microbiological tests, including culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for candidate pathogens, failed to identify an organism (Tables 1 and 2). The patient was treated empirically with acyclovir, ceftriaxone, benzylpenicillin, and vancomycin. Vancomycin and benzylpenicillin were discontinued due to the development of a rash on the patient's hip, and azithromycin was started due to left-sided consolidation observed on his chest x-ray. The patient completed 10 days of antimicrobial therapy with clinical improvement, and his seizure disorder was controlled with levetiracetam and sodium valproate. He was discharged from the hospital, but was readmitted 4 days later with hypersomnolence and a fluctuating level of consciousness. His antiepileptic medications were adjusted, and he was discharged home again. The patient made a partial recovery over the next 2 months but had new short-term memory loss. He was ultimately able to return to work in a reduced capacity. Over the next 2 years, the patient remained seizure free. He utilized compensatory coping strategies at work due to the significant short-term memory deficit, but he was otherwise independent with activities of daily living at home with his parents. There were reports of anxiety and fatigue, but no specific diagnoses were made.",

His Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 7/30 with severe impairment in visuospatial and executive function, attention, abstraction, and delayed recall. 8 He could not perform the Luria maneuver and was unable to mimic simple hand gestures. He had a fine, jerky, postural tremor with his arms outstretched. He had diffuse muscle rigidity with 6 beats of ankle clonus bilaterally. He could stand independently but had a broad-based gait with reduced stride length, stooped posture, and en bloc turning. A follow-up brain MRI demonstrated interval development of diffuse cerebral atrophy with ex vacuo hydrocephalus and additional focal atrophy of the right medial temporal lobe ( Fig 2C  and D ). An MRI of the spinal cord was unremarkable. Repeat CSF examination was unremarkable (Table 2) and showed a normal opening pressure. Normal pressure hydrocephalus was excluded by large volume CSF extraction (30 ml) and comparative neuropsychological testing.",

The runtime for the bioinformatics pipeline described above was 10 to 15 minutes per sample on a single 24core server. After filtering, there were 2 genera remaining in the mNGS dataset from the CSF sample: Bunyamwera virus (taxid: 35304) and cucumber green mottle mosaic virus (taxid: 12234).

Although no Bunyamwera virus sequences were identified in the nt results from the brain biopsy sample, the nr output identified 2 unique read pairs that mapped with 99 to 100% similarity to the CVV S (small) genome segment that encodes the nucleocapsid protein and a nonstructural protein.

The possibility of having introduced a mosquitoborne virus to a new locale is made even more salient by the recent international Zika virus crisis. The spread of Zika to Latin America was in part exacerbated by the delayed recognition of its introduction to Brazil. Recent phylogenetic studies have indicated that Zika virus was circulating for 18 months before it was identified as a pathogen, and for 24 months before it was determined that Zika was likely responsible for the recent increase in the incidence of microcephaly. 40 The most dramatic example of a virus spreading undetected among human populations over many decades remains HIV-1. 41 Because CVV is rarely identified as a cause of human disease and has not been reported in Australia previously, there are no traditional candidate-based diagnostic tests for this virus available in Australia. This unusual case highlights the ability for mNGS to identify pathogens not previously associated with a clinical phenotype and not known to circulate in a geographic area. 2, 3 It is also important to note that mNGS was able to identify CVV in the CSF of this patient; if these results had been available before the brain biopsy, they could have obviated the need for this invasive procedure. The ability to identify unanticipated infections in CSF via mNGS in this patient and others motivates the ongoing prospective, multicenter study currently underway to determine the performance characteristics of an mNGS CSF assay performed in a clinical laboratory environment for patients with acute meningitis with or without encephalitis (http://www. ciapm.org/project/precision-diagnosis-acute-infectious-diseases). When applied more broadly to global pathogen surveillance efforts, mNGS will significantly enhance the detection and monitoring of global biothreats. Finally, this case extends the spectrum of viruses known to cause chronic meningoencephalitis.",
