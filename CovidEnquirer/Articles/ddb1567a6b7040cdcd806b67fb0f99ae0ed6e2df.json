We characterized in mammalian cells the model of ribosomal stalling at the STOP-codon based on proteins tagged at the C-terminus with the picornavirus 2A peptide followed by a termination codon instead of the Proline (2A*). We exploited the 2A* stalling model to characterize the pathway of degradation of ER-targeted polypeptides. We report that the ER chaperone BiP/GRP78 is a new main factor involved. Moreover, degradation of the ER-stalled polypeptides required the activities of the AAA-ATPase VCP/p97, its associated deubiquitinylase YOD1, the ribosome-associated ubiquitin ligase Listerin and the proteasome. In human proteome, we found two human C-terminal amino acid sequences that cause similar stalling at the STOP-codon. Our data suggest that translational stalling at the ER membrane activates protein degradation at the interface of ribosomal-and ERassociated quality control systems.",

            "text": "Proteome homeostasis is crucial for cell survival and involves several levels of quality control mechanisms to avoid production of aberrant protein products [1] . The first checkpoint during biogenesis of polypeptides is co-translational and mediated by ribosomes, which are considered a dynamic center for quality control of both mRNA and nascent proteins. Damaged mRNAs or nascent peptides forming stable interactions with the ribosomal exit tunnel (RET) and the peptidyl-transferase center can cause translational stalling of the ribosomes [2, 3] . Ribosomal stalling is potentially dangerous for the cell survival, therefore different mechanisms have evolved to resolve such events. Translation of erroneous mRNAs owing to a premature termination codon, the lack of termination codon or a broad range of potential stalling sequences often cause degradation of such mRNAs by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), nonstop decay (NSD) and no-go decay (NGD) pathways, respectively [4] [5] [6] . These pathways trigger either ribosomes dissociation and recycling or their degradation together with associated tRNAs and nascent polypeptides [7] . Impairments of these protein quality control pathways are involved in several pathological conditions, such as the Huntington disease [8] and other neurodegenerative diseases [9, 10] . Nascent polypeptides derived from stalled ribosomes are extracted from the RET and targeted to degradation through the proteasome pathway, which involves the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ltn1/Listerin [11, 12] and the AAA ATPase Cdc48/p97 [13] [14] [15] , identified in yeast and mammalian cells. Other players described as part of the ribosome-associated quality control pathway are the integral ribosomal protein Rack1 [16] , the surveillance complex formed by Pelota-HBS1-ABCE1 [4, 17] and the ribosome quality control proteins 1 and 2/NEMF [13, 18, 19] . Beyond the poly-Lys sequence translated from poly(A) tails, diverse peptide sequences have been described to cause ribosomal stalling [2, 20] . Some of them cause stalling at the STOP-codon and have been described in proteins of mammalian viruses, bacteria, fungi and plants [21] [22] [23] [24] .",

This \"non-conventional\" translation termination is the consequence of the 2A activity that mediates processing at its C-terminus altering ribosome activity to promote hydrolysis of the ester bond between the nascent peptide and the tRNA, rather than the formation of the peptide linkage with the aminoacyl-tRNA located on the downstream codon.",

The presence of the STOP-codon would result in an excessively prolonged stalling of ribosomes at the 2A/STOPcodon boundary. To confirm this point, we obtained two bicistronic constructs (schematically shown in Fig. 2b , left panel) in which the upstream protein (pr1) was produced following 2A non-conventional 127 Ribosome stalling induces BiP/GRP78-mediated ERAD termination (i.e., 2A followed by Pro), while the downstream protein (pr2, same as pr1 with an extra polypeptide tag) terminated in either 2A* (pr2-2A*, construct B) or, as a control, in 2A-P* (pr2-2A-P*, construct A). We reasoned that, if ribosomes stall at the STOP-codon downstream of pr2-2A in construct B, expression of the upstream pr1 would also be affected, whereas in the absence of ribosome stalling, pr1 would be equally expressed from constructs A and B. The results clearly show that expression of pr1 (as well as pr2) was highly compromised from construct B, but not from the control construct A, which expressed pr1 at even higher levels than pr2 (Fig. 2b, right panel) . Thus, compromised expression of pr1 on construct B was consistent with ribosome stalling at the 2A-STOPcodon downstream of pr2.",

Deletion of 3 to 5 N-terminal amino acids (constructs \u0394N3, \u0394N4 and \u0394N5) retained strong inhibitory activity, while deletion mutants lacking 6 to 15 aa from the 2A N-terminus (constructs \u0394 N6, \u0394 N7 and \u0394 N15) completely abolished the effect (Fig. 4b) .

In addition, deletion of only NP or P while maintaining the terminal G (\u0394 NP and \u0394 P) also restored expression, although only partially for \u0394 P (Fig. 4d) .

To investigate the degradation pathway of these secretory proteins, cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 or with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ). Significant accumulation of material was observed after MG132, but not after CQ treatment (Fig. 5b) , indicating that polypeptides released from the ER-bound stalled ribosomes were degraded by the proteasome. Cells transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin and treated with the MG132 also showed significantly higher accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated pr1 expressed from 2A* compared to 2A-P* (Fig. 5c) . Furthermore, co-expression with the viral cytosolic deubiquitinylase-like protein OTU (derived from the Congo hemorrhagic fever virus) also caused strong pr1 accumulation from 2A* (Fig. 5d ). OTU removes ubiquitin from cytosolic poly-ubiquitinylated proteins targeted to degradation, impairing their engagement by the proteasome and therefore causing accumulation [35, 36] . Similarly, co-expression with the dominant negative mammalian deubiquitinylase YOD1 (YOD1-C160S) [37] or the dominant negative mutant of the AAA p97 ATPase, which lacks ATPase activity (p97QQ, E305 and E578 mutated into Q) [38] , blocked degradation of pr1 from construct 2A*, which accumulated intracellularly further confirming degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Fig. 5e) . Interestingly, YOD1 deubiquitinylase was previously associated with ERAD and proteasomal degradation of proteins, but not of disposal of ribosome stalled polypeptides. Blocking the ubiquitin-proteasome system with MG132 treatment or co-expression of OTU also showed partial rescue of the MHC-I\u03b1 transmembrane 2A* ribosome stalled protein reporter (Fig. 5f ).",

Detection and quantification of the biotinylated (retro- translocated) fraction was carried out in a Western blot-retardation assay in which denatured samples, incubated with streptavidin (StrAv) before electrophoresis, produce retardation of the biotinylated proteins. As shown in Fig. 6a , most of the intracellular secretory reporter produced from 2A* was biotinylated. As expected, the material accumulated from construct 2A* upon proteasome inhibition with MG132, or co-expression with p97QQ or OTU, was mostly biotinylated (Fig. 6b) , consistent with active retro-translocation from the ER lumen. Upon coexpression with the dominant negative chaperone BiP/GRP78 (T37G), which binds to newly synthesized protein substrates but is unable to undergo the conformational change upon ATP binding required for protein release, a large accumulation of pr1-2A* was observed, similarly to other ERAD targeted BiP substrates [35, 40] .

As shown in Fig. 8a and b, the BioID2 activity was detected by its self-biotinylation. One band of around 78 kDa was found strongly biotinylated in cells expressing BioID2-2A* but not BioID2-2A-P* (Fig. 8a) . We suspected that it represented BiP/GRP78, which was confirmed by pull-down with StrAv followed by detection with anti-BiP as well as by BiP immunoprecipitation followed by detection with StrAv-HRP from cells expressing BioID2-2A* (Fig. 8c) . Mass spectrometry analysis was then performed on pulled-down biotinylated proteins, confirming detection of BiP only in extracts of cells expressing BioID2-2A*, but not BioID2-2A-P*. Mass spectrometry of BioID2-2A* biotinylated proteins also detected the 23-kDa nascent polypeptide-associated complex \u03b1-subunit (NACA) and the 71-kDa cytosolic chaperone HSPA8.

Only five proteins were found [CD99 moleculelike protein 2 (CD99L2), prostate ovary testisexpressed protein family members I and E (POTEI and POTEE), TBCA and SPIRE2, where POTEE and POTEI share the same C-terminal amino acidic sequence]. In most cases, they represent alternative spliced transcripts. We tested the effect exerted on expression of the cytosolic reporter (cyt-scFv) by the four different C-terminal sequences in constructs with and without the addition of the P-codon before the STOP-codon (Fig. 9a) . While the C-termini from TBCA and SPIRE2 did not display any effect on the reporter translation, those from CD99L2 and POTE caused a strong expression decrease compared to the reporter without the terminal sequences (Fig. 9b) . Of note, expression of proteins terminating with these two sequences was partially rescued by the addition of the C-terminal Pro, similar to what observed with peptide 2A. However, and despite of this, non-conventional translation termination was not observed as shown with a construct elongated with the 11-aa roTag downstream of Pro (shown for POTE, Fig. 9c, left  panel) .",

This 2A-STOPmediated impairment of translation represents a strong model of ribosome stalling at the STOPcodon, caused by the 2A last 13 aa and, in particular, by the C-terminal NPG sequence. This indicates that stalling is the consequence of the peptide conformation inside the RET. 2A has been described to form an amphipathic \u03b1-helix over most of its length, with a reverse turn at its C-terminus [44, 45] . In its normal viral context, this structure has been suggested to cause a transient stalling that favors the nonconventional translation termination of the upstreamencoded protein, determined by the position of the 2A terminal G-codon in the ribosome P site and the P-codon in the ribosome A site [32, 33] . Transient ribosome stalling is thought to occur because of reorientation of the peptidyl-tRNA Gly within the RET that disfavors peptide bond formation with the prolyl-tRNA Pro and promotes instead hydrolysis and release of the nascent chain [44, 45] .",

In yeast, the p97 homologous Cdc48 is also part of the ribosome-associated quality control, which recognizes stalled ribosomes in NSD and NGD [13] [14] [15] . The dominant negative mutant of chaperone BiP/ GRP78 was able to retain the protein within the ER lumen. This was the first indication that BiP/GRP78 was involved in targeting to degradation polypeptides produced by stalled ER-bound ribosomes. Indeed, we identified BiP/GRP78 as one of the main proteins interacting with the product of the stalled BioID-2A*. Considering that this chaperone is involved in signaling to convey luminal substrates to ERAD [48] , it makes it a strong candidate to initiate and re-direct the polypeptide from the stalled ribosome to degradation. It is possible that stalled polypeptides may not be capable to complete folding in the ER lumen or remain too long within the translocon, thus recruiting BiP/GRP78 to initiate engagement into the ERAD pathway. Previous works have found that stalled peptides can obstruct the yeast translocon [49] and translocon components were found in association with components of the ribosome-associated quality control in purified pancreatic rough ER microsomes [12] . 2A-tagged stalled proteins may not activate ERAD targeting because of canonical misfolding, as they are identical to the proteins produced by nonconventional termination. This hypothesis can be suggested by BioID2 activity in the ER lumen when bearing the C-terminal 2A, indicating that ERAD could be activated as a direct consequence of translational stalling rather than protein misfolding per se. However, it is also possible that the domain of the stalled protein close to the translocon exit tunnel is not completely folded and could be the portion of the polypeptide efficiently recognized by BiP. Detection of BioID2 activity during ERAD is consistent with previous works demonstrating that some ERAD substrates can be at least partially folded during retro-translocation to the cytosol before degradation [50] [51] [52] .",

When co-expressed in the same cells, we observed that only those polypeptides originating from stalled ribosomes were specifically targeted to degradation, without any effect on the same polypeptide produced from non-stalled ribosomes. This is an indication that either the stalled ribosome signals the ER lumen to re-direct the polypeptide to ERAD or, alternatively, that the extended permanence of the terminated polypeptide in the translocon is a signal for degradation, in both cases mediated by BiP/GRP78. The involvement in 2A* degradation of proteins, such BiP/GRP78 and YOD1, of the ER-associated quality control pathway and enzymes, such as Listerin, belonging to the ribosomal quality control system, indicates that translational stalling at the ER membrane activates a poorly described cellular mechanism at the interface of diverse protein quality control surveillance systems.",

In contrast, in our case, the stalling strongly affects expression of the upstream encoded protein. Recently, an independent ORF was found immediately downstream (in the 3\u2032UTR) of the ORF for protein AMD1 and shown to regulate translation of the upstream ORF by causing ribosomal stalling [43] .

Also, more importantly, both proteins induced degradation of the reporter in a manner similar to the 2A sequence, thus confirming that stalling of ribosomes at the STOP-codon activates degradation of their newly made products through the ERAD pathway.
