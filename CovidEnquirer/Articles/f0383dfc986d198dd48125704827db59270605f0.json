            "text": "Coronaviruses possess a single-stranded, nonsegmented RNA genome of positive polarity (1, 2) and are associated with a variety of diseases in man and animals (3-5). Coronaviruses are divided into two major antigenic groups. The first group includes human coronavirus strain OC43 (HCV-OC43), bovine coronavirus (BCV), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus of swine (HEV) (2, 5). HCV-OC43 causes respiratory infection of man similar to those of influenza viruses (6). BCV causes enteritis of newborn calves and is also considered to be an etiological factor of respiratory diseases of calves (7, 8) . MHV can infect different organs, causing enteric, respiratory, and neurological diseases (5, 9) . A unique property of coronaviruses within this antigenic cluster is the presence of the hemagglutinin/esterase (HE) gene. The genome of MHV-A59 contains an open reading frame (ORF), which may code for an HE protein. However, the HE is not expressed in infected cells (10, 11, 23 binding) and acetylesterase (receptor-destroying) activities similar to the HE (or HEF) glycoprotein of influenza C virus (ICV) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . It was shown that the HE glycoprotein of BCV strain Quebec induces neutralizing antibodies both in vitro and in viva and thus, is important in viral infectivity (21, 22) . It is evidently not required for viral infectivity in MHV-A59 and MHV-JHM (11). The role of the HE gene and its protein in coronavirus evolution, replication, and pathogenesis remains unclear. The exact genomic organization of HCV-OC43 is not known. Antigenic and nucleic acid hybridization studies indicate that the HCV-OC43 is closely related to BCV (23-25).",

Analysis of the sequences revealed that a large ORF of 1272 nucleotides was identical in size to the HE genes of BCVs (29, 30, 44) . This ORF terminated 14 nucleotides upstream from the S gene (Zhang eta/., unpublished data) , and encoded a protein of 424 amino acid residues with an estimated molecular weight of 47.7 kDa (Figs. 1 and 2). Two identical sequences (CTAAAC), similar to the consensus intergenie sequence upstream of the HCV-OC43 N gene (CTAAAT) (26) and identical to the consensus sequence upstream of BCV HE and S genes, were found 16 nt upstream of the predicted initiation codon (at nucleotides 16 to 18) for the HE protein and 8 nt downstream from the termination codon, respectively.",

The alignment shows that several regions are completely identical. Most importantly, the putative acetylesterase active site (F-G-D-S) (at amino acids 72 to 75 in Fig. 2) is conserved in all HE proteins of human, bovine, and murine coronaviruses and ICV. Ten of the 14 cysteine residue positions of HCV-OC43 are conserved among all HE proteins compared. These data suggest that these proteins may be evolutionarily related to each other.",

This was also proposed by Luytjes et al. (10) . Phylogenetic analysis also suggests that the HE genes of coronaviruses and ICV may originate from a common ancestor. It is worth noting that the HE protein of ICV contains receptor-binding, acetylesterase and fusion activities while that of coronaviruses contains only the receptor-binding and acetylesterase activities. The fusion function of ICV is associated with the /V-terminal hydrophobic region of the HE2 subunit of the HE protein (17) (18) (19) 32) . A similar hydrophobic domain was not found in the coronavirus HE protein. The high similarity between the HE proteins of HCV-OC43 and BCVs (95% identity on the average) suggests that both viruses are very closely related. This hypothesis is also supported by the tree branch distance in the phylogenetic analysis shown in Fig. 3 . Interestingly, the HE of HCV-OC43 is more closely related to those of BRCVG95 and the wild-type, virulent strain BCV-LY138 than to that of the cell-culture adapted avirulent strain BCV-L9. The wild-type strain BCV-LY138",

The HCV-OC43, BCVs, and BRCV-G95 differed only in few amino acids in the HE, and their putative acetylesterase active sites were conserved (see Fig. 2 ). 0-acetylneuraminic acid was shown to be the major determinant for ICV (36-38). HCV-OC43, BCVs, and BRCV-G95 probably recognize this receptor on the surface of many different epithelial cells. They may be able to replicate in epithelial cells of both respiratory and intestinal tracts, and to cross species-barriers causing diseases in heterologous hosts. However, HCV-OC43 primarily causes respiratory diseases and BCVs cause enteritis. The ability of these viruses to replicate in different organs and to cause different clinical symptoms is probably due to multiple amino acid differences occurring within several viral proteins.

The DNA sequences were aligned based on their deduced amino acid sequence alignment as shown in Fig. 2. The data were analyzed with the software package PAUP (Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony, version 3.09, D. Swofford, National Historical Survey, IL) using the MULPARS heuristic search option with tree bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch-swapping. From the alignment, 462 phylogenetically informative sites were identified from 1503 aligned base positions per taxon.
