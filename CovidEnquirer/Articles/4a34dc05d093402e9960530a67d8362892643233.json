The Tucson Children's Respiratory Study (TCRS), a prospective unselected birth cohort, identified several risk factors for wheezing during early childhood. Older siblings and daycare, both associated with increased exposure to respiratory viruses, and tobacco smoke exposure were associated with increased risk of early-life wheezing illnesses, whereas breastfeeding was protective. 7 The most common viruses identified during early-life wheezing illnesses are RSV, HRV, and multiple viruses. Less common causes include parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, coronavirus, influenza, bocavirus, and adenovirus.",

Sigurs and colleagues 4 used a case-control methodology to examine the risk of asthma and allergy development after RSV bronchiolitis severe enough to lead to hospitalization. They found that severe RSV bronchiolitis was associated with a significantly increased risk of asthma and allergy at 13 years of age, although some have suggested that the rate of asthma and allergy in their control population was lower than expected.",

A large twin registry in Denmark was used to assess the relationships between severe RSV illness and asthma development. 18, 19 The data from this study suggest that severe RSV illnesses and asthma share a common predisposition, and although RSV can lead to short-term recurrent wheeze, it is not causal in long-term asthma development. Similarly, although the TCRS identified RSV wheezing illnesses during the first 3 years of life as an independent risk factor of wheezing at age 6 years, this relationship weakened over time and was no longer significant by age 13 years. 3 Thus, early RSV wheeze may lead to a recurrent wheeze phenotype, but it is less commonly associated with lifelong asthma. It would be interesting to determine whether the relationships reported from the Tennessee population-based study between 4 and 5.5 years of age persist over time.",

            "text": "However, partly because of the invasive nature of the procedures necessary to directly study the lower airway, there is a paucity of data to help us understand the underlying pathogenesis of loss of lung function in children who start with recurrent virus-induced wheezing but develop persistent disease. Nonetheless, a few studies may shed some light on the inflammatory processes that occur in these children. Krawiec and colleagues 26 performed bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage on children of median age 15 months with recurrent wheezing and to a group of healthy controls. These studies demonstrated that children with persistent wheezing had increased inflammatory cells and markers of inflammation compared with healthy controls but did not have the characteristic eosinophil predominance seen in older children and adults with asthma. Similarly, Saglani and colleagues 27 performed bronchoscopy and biopsy in children of median age 12 months with persistent wheezing and were unable to demonstrate either eosinophilic inflammation or reticular basement membrane (RBM) thickening, both common features of asthma seen in older children and adults. In contrast, in further studies of older children with recurrent wheezing of median age 29 months, they were able to demonstrate the presence of eosinophilic inflammation and RBM thickening when compared with a group of controls. This suggests that inflammatory changes and remodeling typical of asthma develop between 1 and 3 years of age in recurrently wheezing children and highlights the potential importance of environmental exposures, such as virus infections, during this period.",

The authors also found increased VEGF in nasal lavage fluid of volunteers with natural HRV infections. In another epithelial cell model, Zhu and colleagues 30 found that HRV infection led to toll-like receptor 3-dependent mucin production and upregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor, a prominent component of epithelial repair. Finally, epithelial cell gene expression studies have identified several potential novel pathways involved in the response to HRV infection. Proud and colleagues 31 found that HRV infection led to upregulation of many genes, perhaps most notably in interferon and airway repair and remodeling pathways. Bochkov and colleagues 32 similarly Virus Infections in Childhood Asthma Inception demonstrated that HRV infection led to upregulation of a number of genes involved in interferon and airway remodeling pathways. In this study, differences between asthmatics and controls were similar before and during HRV infection. In summary, although data that demonstrates causality of HRV infection in asthma inception are limited, several plausible mechanisms by which recurrent HRV infection could lead to airway damage and remodeling have been identified and are deserving of further study.",

            "text": "Interferons are known to play an important role in the host response to virus infections, and there is growing data to support a prominent role for interferons in the pathogenesis of virus-induced wheezing and asthma. Gern and colleagues 35 linked immature peripheral blood interferon-g responses to mitogens and viruses at birth with recurrent wheezing during infancy. Similarly, Stern and colleagues 36 connected reduced peripheral blood interferon-g responses to mitogen at 9 months of age to an increased risk of wheezing in toddlers and school-aged children. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from adult asthmatics produce less interferon-g in response to HRV infection than controls, 37 and the degree of impairment correlates with airway hyperresponsiveness and degree of airway obstruction. 38 Several other investigators, through experiments on airway epithelial cells and in peripheral blood, have identified deficiencies in interferons as an important potential mechanism for asthmatics' susceptibility to more severe HRV illnesses. Wark and colleagues. 39 demonstrated that bronchial epithelial cells from atopic asthmatics infected with HRV in vitro have deficient interferon-b (a type I interferon) responses when compared with controls. In this study, the decreased interferon-b response was associated with delayed apoptosis and increased viral replication, which was overcome with the addition of exogenous interferon-b. Additionally, lower levels of interferon-a (another type I interferon) responses have been demonstrated in the peripheral blood of children 40 and adults 41 with atopic asthma versus nonatopic controls. Finally, Contoli and colleagues 42 found that bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages from atopic asthmatics had impaired interferon-l (a type III interferon) responses to HRV infection and that these responses correlated with decline of forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration during exacerbations. Although these studies have identified defects in interferon pathways as potential important contributors to early childhood wheezing and asthma, unfortunately, attempts to replicate these findings have not always been successful. Two recent studies found no difference in epithelial cell responses between asthmatics and controls. 32, 43 Another important component of the innate immune response to virus infection is barrier function. Barrier function of the skin is important in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis, with filaggrin mutations identified in several patients with severe atopic dermatitis. 44 Ongoing allergic inflammation may lead to a local or acquired filaggrin deficit. 45 Several studies have highlighted how disruption of the airway epithelium could alter host antiviral responses and severity of lower respiratory illnesses. In fact, filaggrin mutations have been identified as a risk factor of asthma and asthma exacerbations in children. 46 ,47 A unique model of airway injury took this observation one step further in demonstrating the potential consequences of impairment in airway barrier function through physical injury. Jakiela and colleagues, 48 using in vitro epithelial cell culture, showed that mechanical injury to the epithelia resulted in increased replication of HRV. This is a potential mechanism by which various host factors or environmental exposures, such as allergen, tobacco smoke, and previous virus infection, could lead to impairment in barrier function, increased viral replication, and more severe lower respiratory illnesses.",

Plausible mechanisms of causality have been identified but are in need of further study. The most definitive way to prove causality would be to prevent HRV infection and demonstrate reductions in asthma development, but vaccines for HRV have proven elusive, in part due to the nearly 150 existing species Virus Infections in Childhood Asthma Inception of HRV. Studies attempting to identify more virulent or asthmogenic forms of HRV are ongoing and could prove very informative.
