For the Netherlands, we estimated age and risk-group specific numbers of antibiotics, otologicals and cardiovascular prescriptions per 10,000 person-years during periods with elevated activity of influenza or RSV, and compared these with peri-season rates. Data were taken from the University of Groningen in-house prescription database (www.iadb.nl) and virological surveillance for the period 1998-2006. During influenza and RSV periods excess antibiotic prescriptions were estimated for all age groups. In the age groups 0-1 and 2-4 years, excess antibiotic prescriptions during periods with elevated RSV activity (65% and 59% of peri-seasonal rates) exceeded the surpluses estimated during the influenza-activity periods (24% and 34% of peri-seasonal rates) while for otologicals excess prescriptions were higher for influenza (22% and 27%) than for RSV (14% and 17%). Among persons of 50 years and older, notably those without medical high-risk conditions, excess prescriptions for cardiovascular medications were estimated during the influenza periods at approximately 10% (this was also already seen in persons aged 45-49). Our results may have implications for influenza vaccination policies. In particular, extension of influenza vaccination to groups of non-elderly adults and young children may lower excess prescriptions during these influenza periods for all three types of drug prescriptions investigated.",

In the Netherlands until 2007, the age-threshold for such vaccination was 65 years for non-high-risk groups. In 2008, this threshold was lowered to include all persons aged 60 years and older [1] . In addition in the Netherlands, all high-risk groups are vaccinated, including individuals suffering from chronic conditions, respiratory diseases, cardiac diseases, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, those being immunocompromised and individuals aged less than 18 years of age on chronic salicylates use [1] . Vaccination rates among these high-risk groups under 65 years of age ranged from 66% to 83% in the Netherlands in 2005 [2] . Persons of 65 years and older with a medical indication showed higher vaccination coverages compared to those of the same age without such an indication, at 90% and 76% in 2005, respectively [2] . Influenza may cause acute bronchitis and pneumonia in high-risk groups and elderly and may lead to exacerbations of underlying chronic medical conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, asthma and diabetes, potentially leading to hospitalisations and death. Prevention of influenza infection by vaccination is of high importance for these groups with an increased risk for complications from influenza infection [3] [4] [5] .",

Yet, vaccination of all healthy children in this age group could be cost-effective or even cost-saving for some societal settings [6] . In the Netherlands, universal influenza vaccination of such children is in debate, however yet the vaccine efficacy and effectiveness for this specific age group is not considered to be sufficiently demonstrated [7] [8] [9] . Therefore, the Dutch Health Council concluded in 2007 , not yet to start with influenza vaccination of these groups [1] . Comparable conclusions were made for healthy children aged 2 years and older. Although vaccination was shown to be effective for these children, influenza was considered not to cause serious morbidity or mortality in the Netherlands in those groups [1] .",

For burden of disease often the label Influenza Like Illnesses (ILI) is considered to primarily comprise disease due to influenza infections, however known to potentially comprise various other agents inclusive RSV, with the identification of the relative contributions of both viruses being strongly hampered [18] [19] [20] [21] . In particular, even further viral agents, such as adeno-, parainfluenza-, and corona-viruses may contribute to the burden of ILI [21, 22] . For exactly analysing the burdens of disease of influenza and RSV separately, which is the goal of our current paper, ILI is therefore an inappropriate concept. Therefore, we chose to analyse isolates exactly related to the respective causal agents.",

In particular, prescriptions for antibiotics, otologicals and cardiovascular medication may be elevated, dispensed for otitis media, cardiac complications, respiratory illness and other pulmonary complications.

Following Jansen et al., the second method defined the weeks with elevated activity as those weeks from any period of at least 2 consecutive weeks, with each individual week accounting for over 5% of the season's total number of influenzaor RSV-positive specimens [18] . From both methods, it appeared that periods consisting of a number of subsequent weeks resulted, rather than individual weeks or short periods of, for example, 2 weeks only. Such periods would be expected -and were indeed found -to be between week 40 and week 20 in the next year (the non-summer season) [18, 25] .",

For analytical purposes, the prescriptions were divided over 5-year age categories. The age category 0-4 years was further divided in the ages 0-1 and 2-4, to enable analysis of infants separately.

Other medications for cystic fibrosis, such as acetylcysteine, are also prescribed for cough and were therefore not included. Table 1 lists these drugs specifically. For heart medication, diuretic sulfonamides were included. Other diuretics used for lowering blood pressure were excluded, as high-blood pressure is not a high-risk identified condition. Furthermore, only calcium antagonists with ATC-code C08D were included as only these are assumed to have cardiac effects. Beta blockers and RAAS system agents were excluded as these are not exclusively prescribed for cardiac diseases, but also, for example, for high-blood pressure only. For renal diseases, medication for the treatment of hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia, and antianemic preparations and sulfonamides were included as these are often prescribed for dialysis or renal insufficiency.

Otologicals may also be prescribed for AOM, despite that they are not recommended by the Dutch College of General Practitioners (NHG) [29] . In addition, more than average numbers of antibiotics may be prescribed for elderly persons with ILI during periods with elevated activity, as particularly this group may develop acute respiratory illnesses (for example, pneumonia) as a complication of the viral infection (trimethoprim and nitrofurantoin were excluded from the analysis as they are prescribed primarily for urinary tract infections) [33] . For antibiotics and otologicals both initial and next prescriptions within the same year were considered. It is well known that influenza-related complications are more prevalent among persons with cardiovascular and other chronic diseases than in persons without such underlying conditions [4, 34] . In persons of 65 years and older with high-risk conditions an increased rate of hospitalisation for cardiac problems has been reported [17] . Some further recent studies suggest that there might also be an association between cardiovascular problems and influenza epidemics among groups without any cardiovascular history yet, such as the elderly or even among those aged below 65 years of age [23, 35] . For analysing cardiovascular medications, only first prescriptions were considered as our current interest was to investigate whether the viral infections were related to new cardiovascular disease and/or exacerbations of existing -yet untreatedbackground cardiovascular conditions, rather than identify chronic medications for cardiovascular diseases (note that chronic cardiovascular medication use was used as a criterion for assigning persons to the high-risk group). A prescription was defined as a first prescription when a person had not had a prescription for the same drug or a drug from the same subgroup in the year before that specific prescription.",

Table 3 presents the number of person-years for the influenza, RSV, peri-season and summer periods per age and risk group. For infants and children aged 2-4, the high-risk group was very small with 393 person-years in the influenza period and 454 personyears for the RSV period, and therefore only the figures for both low-and high-risk groups taken together were used for these ages. Furthermore, in all age groups the number of person-years in the high-risk group was lower than the numbers in the low-risk group. We also note, as expected, that the older age groups contained relatively more person-years in the high-risk group than the younger age groups. Fig. 1 shows the number of positive findings for RSV and influenza per week. The annual influenza and RSV epidemics are clearly seen, as is the overlap in some years. Also the number of (first) prescriptions per 10,000 persons for antibiotics, otologicals and cardiovascular medication is plotted for the total population. In particular, for antibiotics a clear pattern is visible in which during influenza and RSV activity periods a peak in antibiotic use occurs. Additionally, we notice that in the younger age groups amoxicillin was the mostly prescribed antibiotic, whereas from the age group 5-19 onwards other antibiotics were mostly prescribed (data not shown).",

The incidence rates of antibiotics were increased during the influenza and the RSV periods in comparison with the peri-season (and the summer season). This increase was noticeable for every year.

This tendency also applied to low-risk elderly as compared to highrisk elderly, despite the fact that this whole group is recommended for vaccination. Some choices in our research should be noted. Specifically, the lower limit for the weekly moving-averaged number of isolates for weeks to be labelled as active was chosen by two different methods. The first used a cut-off of two times the average number of influenza or RSV isolates per week. This limit was chosen to achieve continuous periods per year of weeks subsequently labelled as active, i.e. to guarantee epidemic periods rather than fluctuations. The second method was used to be in concordance with a previously performed Dutch study using the weeks which accounted for 5% or more of the season's total number of influenza or RSV isolates [18] .

This is certainly in line with our findings on excess antibiotic and otological prescriptions among the youngest age groups and cardiovascular medication surpluses among the older age groups. In contrast to other studies which showed higher morbidity and mortality among the oldest age groups compared with non-elderly adults, our study shows that the elevation in the prescriptions of antibiotics in the oldest age groups (65 years of age and older) is not higher than in the two younger age groups (55-59 and 60-64). Yet, if compared with other adult age groups, a small increase could be seen. For influenza, this slightly deviating finding compared to non-Dutch settings, might be explained by the high vaccination coverage among elderly in the Netherlands.",

In line with their findings, we showed a significant surplus in first cardiovascular medication prescriptions during influenzaactive periods, but not during RSV-active periods for those aged 45 years and over. Elevated hospitalisation and prescription rates during influenza periods in persons aged around 50 years and beyond suggests that influenza may cause cardiovascular diseases or that it may aggravate existing non-diagnosed cardiovascular diseases in older adults. Another hypothesis explaining this increase might be that increased cardiovascular problems during influenza periods are related to the increased use of analgesics during those periods to alleviate influenza symptoms [45] .
