North Shore-LIJ Health System Laboratories in collaboration with BARC USA (Lake Success, NY, USA) did virology tests on nasopharyngeal swab, which were placed into 3 mL of viral transport medium and transported refrigerated to a central laboratory within 24 h. The swab samples were eluted, divided into aliquots, and immediately frozen at -70\u00b0C. Naso pharyngeal swabs at baseline and on day 7 were cultured for infl uenza viruses and analysed by RT-PCR with the ProdesseProfl u+ (Gen-Probe Prodesse, Waukesha, WI, USA) for infl uenza A and B and the Luminex xTag RVP v1 assay (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX, USA) to detect infl uenza A (non-specifi c for subtype), infl uenza A subtypes seasonal H1 and H3, infl uenza B, respiratory syncytial virus A, respiratory syncytial virus B, adenovirus, human meta-pneumovirus, enterovirus or rhinovirus, parainfl uenza viruses 1, 2, 3, and 4, and coronaviruses 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1. Samples positive for infl uenza A were also analysed by real-time RT-PCR for 2009 infl uenza A H1N1 on the basis of CDC protocol. 16 For participants positive for infl uenza A or B by culture or RT-PCR at baseline, viral titres were measured at baseline and all subsequent collection points. We calculated titres as log 10 tissue culture infective dose 50 (TCID 50 )/0\u00b72 mL and as log 10 RNA copies with a quantitative RT-PCR method developed and validated by North Shore-LIJ Health System Laboratories. For participants diagnosed with infl uenza by culture or RT-PCR at baseline, we measured infl uenza antibody titres by haemagglutination inhibition assay from serum samples obtained at baseline and at day 28 to assess eff ect of treatment on humoral immune response. Reference antigens used for measurement of antibody titres were H1/A/ California/7/2009, H3/A/Perth/16/2009, and B/ Brisbane/60/2008. To assess potential for resistance, we tested the viruses cultured from nasopharyngeal swab samples of nitazoxanide-treated participants on day 5 or day 7 and the corresponding virus sample from baseline (day 1) for susceptibility to tizoxanide as previously described. 5",

In this study, we enrolled participants within 48 h of symptom onset, whereas most clinical trials of neuraminidase inhibitors enrolled participants within 36 h of symptom onset.

Another trial in participants admitted to hospital with severe acute respiratory illness (NCT02057757) is in progress.

With the same search terms, we also searched for articles published in English between Jan 1, 1990, and Jan 29, 2014, reporting placebo-controlled clinical trials of drugs for treatment of infl uenza. We identifi ed nine systematic reviews or meta-analyses within the past 5 years related to the use of the neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamivir, and we identifi ed several articles reporting randomised placebo-controlled clinical trials reporting a treatment eff ect of oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, or intravenous peramivir 8-12,17-26 (another neuraminidase inhibitor) in reducing the time from fi rst dose to alleviation of symptoms in participants with acute uncomplicated infl uenza. Articles have also reported benefi cial treatment eff ect of oseltamivir and zanamivir in otherwise healthy children infected with infl uenza. Evidence to support treatment benefi ts of neuraminidase inhibitors in elderly and at-risk groups or their eff ects on rates of admission to hospital and mortality was insuffi cient.",

            "text": "In our trial, oral administration of nitazoxanide 600 mg twice daily for 5 days reduced the time to alleviation of symptoms of infl uenza in otherwise healthy adults and adolescents by roughly 1 day. Although many factors can aff ect the size of treatment eff ect observed in diff erent clinical trials, the eff ect recorded in this trial is similar to that previously reported for the neuraminidase inhibitors. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] 17, 18, 27 Data from this trial suggest a treatment benefi t of nitazoxanide in participants without infl uenza or other documented viral infection-a fi nding that has not been reported for the neuraminidase inhibitors. Importantly, nitazoxanide possesses a novel mechanism of action against infl uenza viruses. A new drug with a diff erent mechanism of action could ultimately prove benefi cial in overcoming resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors or in providing more potent therapy when used in combination with existing drugs. As a fi rst step, it has been important to show eff ectiveness of nitazoxanide in a randomised placebo controlled trial by use of a method established for licensure of existing drugs. Further studies are warranted to confi rm our fi ndings and to assess effi cacy of nitazoxanide alone or in combination with existing drugs in seriously ill patients and those at risk of infl uenza complications.",
