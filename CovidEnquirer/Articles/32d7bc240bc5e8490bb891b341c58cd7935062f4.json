The ordinary least squares estimation results of panel regression test revealed that GTA significantly affects GS, but has no significant effect on financial performance (proxied by hotel equity return). However, quantile regression tests revealed new and interesting results. GTA has a significant effect on GS at the different quantiles of GS. In comparison, although hotel equity return was not significantly related to GTA at the median and high quantiles, the effect of GTA on hotel equity return was statistically significant at the low quantiles. These results suggest that the effect of GTA on hotel equity return is asymmetric and state-dependent, conditional on the distributions of hotel equity return. The study further identified that GTA has a significant influence only on equity returns of hotels with a small size.",

On the one hand, tourism growth can directly enhance the development of hotel industry by increasing the hotel occupancy rate and hence sales revenue. Chen (2010) and Chen and Kim (2010) found that tourism growth proxied by the growth rate of total foreign tourist arrivals (GTA) in Taiwan has a significant influence on hotel sales and profitability. Kim et al. (2006) revealed that tourism growth can cause significant economic growth in Taiwan. Chen (2007b) further showed that improved economic/business conditions caused by tourism growth can increase sales and strengthen the financial performance of hospitality-related companies in Taiwan. Accordingly, tourism growth, on the other hand, can significantly promote economic growth and improve business conditions, which in turn can have an indirect effect on the hotel industry.",

Chen (2007a) investigated the effect of some selected economic variables and GTA on HER in Taiwan. The monthly tourism growth had a positive effect on the monthly HER, but the influence was not statistically significant. Similarly, Chen (2010) found that the quarterly tourism growth rate could not significantly explain the quarterly HER. Chen (2011) offered an explanation for the absence of a significant relationship between tourism growth and HER. As mentioned, based on equity valuation model, variations in equity price reflect not only the future earnings stream, but also the perceived riskiness of equity cash flows. In other words, both changes in sales earnings and the perceived riskiness of equity cash flows could cause fluctuations in equity price. He detected that tourism growth has a strong effect on growth rate of hotel sales (GS), but not on the perceived riskiness of equity cash flows.",
