            "text": "Objective: To compare the effectiveness of self-collected and health care worker (HCW)-collected nasal swabs for detection of influenza viruses and determine the patients' preference for type of collection. Patients and Methods: We enrolled adult patients presenting with influenzalike illness to the Emergency Department at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, from January 28, 2011, through April 30, 2011. Patients self-collected a midturbinate nasal flocked swab from their right nostril following written instructions. A second swab was then collected by an HCW from the left nostril. Swabs were tested for influenza A and B viruses by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and percent concordance between collection methods was determined. Results: Of the 72 paired specimens analyzed, 25 were positive for influenza A or B RNA by at least one of the collection methods (34.7% positivity rate). When the 14 patients who had prior health care training were excluded, the qualitative agreement between collection methods was 94.8% (55 of 58). Two of the 58 specimens (3.4%) from patients without health care training were positive only by HCW collection, and 1 of 58 (1.7%) was positive only by patient self-collection. A total of 53.4% of patients (31 of 58) preferred the self-collection method over the HCW collection, and 25.9% (15 of 58) had no preference. Conclusion: Self-collected midturbinate nasal swabs provide a reliable alternative to HCW collection for influenza A and B virus real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.",

            "text": "I nfluenza A and B are highly contagious respiratory viruses transmitted directly between infected and healthy individuals by large, virus-containing respiratory droplets generated by coughing or sneezing. Infection can also be transmitted indirectly by contact with contaminated surfaces followed by selfinoculation of ocular, nasal, or oral mucosa. Adults are typically infectious to others from 1 day before developing symptoms to approximately 5 days after symptom onset. Young children and immunocompromised persons may shed virus for even longer, with shedding reported for 10 or more days after symptom onset. [1] [2] [3] [4] Surveillance studies have identified health care setting-acquired influenza outbreaks. 5 Influenza A and B viruses can spread rapidly between patients and health care workers (HCWs) in health care settings and may have serious and devastating consequences to high-risk populations. In particular, the elderly, critically ill, young children, and immunosuppressed patients including those receiving antineoplastic chemotherapy and/or solid organ or bone marrow transplant are at highest risk of developing serious influenza complications. The risks of infection-driven complications coupled with the clustering of these susceptible patients in the health care setting emphasize the need to minimize both patient and provider influenza virus exposures. 1, [6] [7] [8] The overall burden of health care facility-acquired influenza is unknown, but the potential economic and clinical impact is significant. 3, 5, 7 A simple approach to prevent close contact in the health care setting and decrease unnecessary utilization of health care services during influenza season is to have select patient groups (eg, previously healthy adults with no underlying medical conditions) collect their own nasal swab and deliver it to a convenient drop-off location for testing. This could be facilitated by a well-designed telephone or online triage system that would obviate the need for a health care visit in selected patients. Use of this strategy would require that patient-collected samples have similar sample quality and test efficacy for detection of influenza A and B virus RNA compared with those collected by a trained HCW.",

However, there are no studies directly comparing the sensitivity of pa- tient-and HCW-collected nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs for influenza A and B molecular testing. Therefore, our aim was to determine the degree of concordance between paired midturbinate nasal flocked swabs collected by the patient and an HCW using a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay for influenza A and B viruses. Furthermore, we conducted a survey to determine the patients' preference for self-vs HCWcollected specimens and their perceived degree of difficulty in collecting their specimen with a nasal flocked swab.",

A second midturbinate nasal flocked swab was collected immediately after the patient collection by a trained HCW from the left nostril. Each swab was placed in an individually labeled container with universal transport media (Diagnostic Hybrids, Athens, OH) and sent to the clinical microbiology laboratory for rRT-PCR testing. All specimens were transported within 2 hours of collection using the hospital pneumatic tube system and stored in the laboratory at 4 C until processed. After swab collection, the participants were asked to complete a questionnaire that subjectively rated the degree of difficulty in obtaining the self-collected swab (very difficult, difficult, easy, or very easy) and their preference for collection technique (self-collected, HCW-collected, or no preference). Demographic information including age, sex, race, occupation, and influenza vaccination status was also obtained. Patients who were dependent on oxygen via nasal cannula or were unable to provide verbal consent were excluded from the study. All positive results (regardless of collection method) were reported to the health care provider (primary care physician, nurse practitioner or physician assistant) to ensure appropriate patient management.",

The assay was modified for use on the Light-Cycler 480 (Roche Applied Science). A positive result is produced by this assay when amplification of viral RNA generates a fluorescent signal above the instrument detection threshold. The number of rRT-PCR cycles at which the signal crosses the threshold is known as the crossing point (Cp), which is inversely correlated to the logarithm of the initial copy number; higher Cps correlate with lower levels of viral RNA.

Like Esposito et al, we used the recently introduced midturbinate nasal flocked swabs for sample collection. Unlike traditional swabs that are constructed by wrapping absorbent rayon fibers around a sturdy applicator, flocked swabs have no internal mattress core to entrap the sample. As a result, the entire sample stays close to the surface and elutes quickly and completely into testing media. Both swabs have a similar diameter. Recent studies have indicated that midturbinate nasal flocked swabs have high sensitivity and specificity for detection of common respiratory viruses by direct immunofluorescent antibody and molecular assays compared with nasopharyngeal swabs, while only being inserted to half the depth. 14,16-18 Thus, the midturbinate nasal flocked swabs provide a less invasive yet sensitive alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs and are more amenable to patient self-collection. The swabs used in this study have a safety collar to indicate the depth of insertion and are also available in a pediatric version for children aged 2 years or younger.",

First, the study had a relatively small number of patients with influenza B infection compared with those with influenza A, although it is unlikely that the method of collection would have any influence on detection of influenza by type. Second, most study participants were white, and hence, the results may not be generalizable to broader populations with disparate socioeconomic, educational, and racial backgrounds. Third, since midturbinate nasal flocked swabs were employed in this study, extrapolation of results to commercially available molecular systems that require use of nasopharyngeal swabs may require further validation studies.

First, the patient-collection strategy may reduce time spent in the outpatient clinic or emergency department (ED) and thus reduce influenza exposure risks to other vulnerable patients and HCWs. We view this as a considerable advantage because outpatient clinic and ED waiting rooms often collectively group immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients together, and waiting times are commonly prolonged. Patient protection is a priority, and minimizing unintentional exposures to influenza virus is a primary objective of this testing approach. Second, self-collection may provide a more time-efficient testing approach, which could lead to an earlier diagnosis of influenza infection and initiation of time-sensitive antiviral treatment. Third, this strategy could decrease the burden on busy outpatient clinics and EDs during peak influenza season if combined with a triage method to determine which patients should be tested and if self-collection is an appropriate strategy. Finally, patient collection may be useful for large epidemiological or vaccine efficacy studies in which patient or parent collection may ensure better compliance. Of note, this method potentially could be used for detection of other respiratory viruses in addition to influenza A and B, such as respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, and coronavirus. This should be examined further using laboratorydeveloped or commercially available individual and multiplex molecular respiratory platforms.",

Five potential participants were not comfortable obtaining a midturbinate nasal flocked swab themselves and opted not to participate in the study for this reason. Therefore, self-collection programs may wish to provide an alternative mechanism for HCW collection when necessary. It is also important to note that some patients may encounter difficulties in reading or interpreting written instructions or opening the swab packaging. Consideration should be given to providing instructions in multiple languages and providing easy-to-open packaging. Picture-based instructions may be created for a wider variety of patients, including illiterate patients, patients with limited reading skills, children, and those for whom English is not the first language. Further, pictures may improve adherence to instructions by avoiding misinterpretations of written instructions even among literate patients. Self-collection in lieu of an office or ED visit is not appropriate for all patients, such as those with complicated illness or risk factors for severe disease. It may also not be useful to test all patients who present with an ILI if treatment is going to be prescribed regardless of the laboratory result. Diagnosing influenza, however, can avoid unnecessary antibacterial therapy in the appropriate early settings. Practice-specific algorithms can be used to direct patients to appropriate testing (or nontesting) options.",

            "text": "On the basis of our experience, we propose a model for \"personalized patient care\" by providing a structured system for patient-collected nasal swabs ( Figure 2 ). Patients could first be screened over the phone by a trained HCW using a standardized triage questionnaire to determine whether self-collection is appropriate for that particular patient according to an assessment of risk factors and disease severity. If treatment decisions will not be influenced by the test result, then testing may not be indicated. If the patient is eligible for self-collection, then the patient or a caregiver would be offered the option of obtaining a swab kit with instructions from an easy access point such as a community-based clinic, pharmacy, drive-through facility, or even a specialized vending machine. If patients are not comfortable obtaining their own specimen, then they may be offered an office visit. After self-collection, the patient or caregiver would drop the swab off at a convenient location designed to maximize testing turnaround time. After testing is performed, the laboratory result could be communicated to the patient or a health care provider (primary care physician, nurse practitioner or physician assistant) who could offer further instruction and decide whether treatment is appropriate. At our institution, a prescription for oseltamivir may be generated by a health care provider and sent to the laboratory along with the patient's swab specimen. 15 If the test result is positive for influenza, then the laboratory will fax the prescription to the patient's pharmacy. If the test result is negative, then the prescription is not faxed. This serves to link the prescription to the positive test result and avoid unnecessary drug use. The patients obtain their test results by calling a registered phone number and providing their unique patient identification number. The automated phone service informs the patient when a prescription has been sent to the pharmacy on the basis of a positive laboratory result. It is easy to envision how this system could be further modified to suit the needs of the clinical practice and the patients it serves. This same approach has been used for many years at our institution for detection of group A streptococci in patients suspected to have streptococcal pharyngitis. 19 In addition to clinical benefits, patient self-collection may alleviate cost burdens to the health care system and patient. At our institution, a visit to the ED for an uncomplicated ILI costs the health care FIGURE 2. Proposed model for patient-collected midturbinate nasal swabs for influenza polymerase chain reaction assay. An influenzalike illness (A) prompts the patient to call the Nurse Triage Center (B), where a nurse assesses the patient's condition via a standardized phone questionnaire. If eligible, the patient is offered the opportunity to self-collect a nasal swab in lieu of an office visit. A prescription for oseltamivir is generated and placed with a swab kit. The patient or caregiver obtains the swab kit from an easy-access point (C) and uses the midturbinate nasal flocked swab to obtain a sample following written instructions (D). The swab is then delivered to the clinical microbiology laboratory for polymerase chain reaction assay (E), along with a precompleted prescription. If the swab is positive for influenza, the prescription is sent to the patient's pharmacy. The patient receives the test result by an automated phone system (F), along with information to pick up the prescription if the test is positive (G).",
