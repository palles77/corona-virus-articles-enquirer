Furthermore, MP576 ium bromide) assay. To test our hypothesis that the 104 selected compounds represent diverse molecular can be docked favorably into the active site of SARS-CoV M pro ( Figure 2C ), consistent with the in vitro cleavage blockers of various biological pathways crucial for SARS-CoV infectivity, we screened for molecules tar-data indicating that MP576 is a novel nonpeptide inhibitor of SARS-CoV M pro . Since SARS-CoV M pro shares a geting viral entry, transcription, and proteolytic processing, the three major processes essential for suc-similar structural fold with serine proteases [21, 23] , we tested the inhibitory activity of MP576 on human neutro-cessful viral replication in the host. phil elastase (HNE). Using azocasein as the substrate, we demonstrated that 100 M of MP576 failed to inhibit Compounds Targeting SARS-CoV M pro SARS-CoV M pro is believed to play a major role in proteo-the proteolytic activity of HNE ( Figure 2D ), suggesting that MP576 is not a general protease inhibitor. lytic processing of the viral polyproteins and is regarded as a prime target for anti-SARS-CoV drug development [20, 21] .

We cloned the SARS-nents essential for transcription and replication, we selected the SARS-CoV Hel, which we had previously CoV M pro in an E. coli expression system and obtained purified enzyme to examine if any of the 104 selected cloned and characterized [24], for our assay system. It was demonstrated that the SARS-CoV NTPase/helicase compounds targets this vital component of the virus. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based had an unstimulated ATPase activity that could be stimulated by the addition of polynucleotides, in particular assays were used to monitor the in vitro cleavage activity nated HE602) exhibited substantial inhibitory activity at 2 g/ml. HE602 was found to strongly inhibit the polynucleotide-stimulated ATPase activity of SARS-CoV Hel with an IC 50 of 6.9 M ( Figure 3A ), but barely inhibited the dT 24 . As the functional conformation of the helicase is likely to be the nucleic acid-bound state, we initially unstimulated ATPase activity even at a concentration of 200 M ( Figure 3B ). In the helicase assay, a duplex screened the 104 active compounds against the polynucleotide-stimulated ATPase activity of SARS-CoV Hel DNA was prepared incorporating a 5\u0408 overhang that is required for SARS-CoV helicase activity. The shorter strand of the duplex DNA incorporated a 32 P label so that differential migration of the duplex or single-stranded oligonucleotide could be easily observed following polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It can be clearly seen that both 200 and 20 M concentrations of HE602 inhibited the helicase activity of the SARS-CoV Hel, while 2 and 0.2 M concentrations did not inhibit the helicase activity ( Figure 3C) . It was only possible to perform a qualitative assay with this system, but these results are fully consistent with the IC 50 value that we measured using our quantitative ATPase assay. Furthermore, HE602 inhibited the viral plaque formation in Vero cell with an EC 50 of 6 M ( Figure 3D ). The effective inhibition of only the stimulated ATPase activity together with its ability to inhibit helicase activity indicates that HE602 has distinct parallels with the pharmacological profiles of inhibitors targeted against the herpes simplex virus (HSV) helicase-primase protein [23, 25] . pounds are indisputable, the precise mode of inhibition Based on the concept of chemical genetics, we have established a HTS platform to identify small-molecule of these novel inhibitors is currently under investigation. In addition, one has to be cautioned that the ultimate compounds that will perturb the pathogenic pathways of SARS-CoV in Vero cells. After screening 50,240 validation of their targets will be the selection of chemical-resistant viruses and subsequent identification of structurally diverse small-molecule compounds against SARS-CoV infection in a cellular model, we have identi-genetic mutations conferring the resistant phenotype.",

HNE Activity Assay 200 nM of HNE (Calbiochem, CA) was preincubated at 25\u040aC in 75 Received: June 4, 2004 l of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 150 mM NaCl, for 30 min in the Revised: July 6, 2004 presence or absence of 100 M of MP576. Azocasein (Sigma) was Accepted: July 8, 2004 added to the mixture to a final concentration of 0.5% in 100 l and Published: September 17, 2004 incubated at 25\u040aC for 60 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 250 l 6% TFA. The mixture was centrifuged at 5000 \u03eb References g for 15 min at 25\u040aC.
