Poor satisfaction levels reflect a large difference between expectations and fulfilment of perceived needs, and may have implications for adherence to treatment that subsequently affects patient outcomes. 1 For example, following cardiac surgery, patients dissatisfied with discharge information were more likely to report a poorer physical recovery and psychological state at home 1 month after undergoing surgery. 2 Family satisfaction with care Severe illness and its potential outcome impacts not only on the patient, but also their close family, defined as those persons with close family, social or emotional relationships with the patient. In addition, many intensive care unit (ICU) patients cannot make decisions for themselves. Their family must, therefore, become surrogate decisionmakers for important parts of the care process. Hence, measuring family satisfaction with ICU care has become an important and essential component of quality of care in this setting. 3 Strengths and limitations of this study \u25aa This randomised controlled trial will determine the effect of preoperative patient education on patient anxiety and depression levels, and satisfaction with intensive care unit (ICU) care and decision-making process from the perspectives of patient and family. \u25aa Patient education intervention (15 min video and an ICU site tour) may help set more achievable recovery goals and expectations. \u25aa The overall contact time in the ICU is limited, in most cases for 24 hours after cardiac surgery.",

            "text": "Several family satisfaction surveys measuring satisfaction with general ICU care have been developed with sound psychometric properties, and have been reviewed elsewhere. 4 The key domains related to family satisfaction include ICU environment 5 6 and process of care, 5 sufficient information, and quality communication with medical professionals to make important decisions about care. 5 7 In order to improve the quality of care in ICU, it is essential to examine the perspectives of the patients and their family members, 6 8 and implement strategies to address areas of concern. As an example of the impact of the environment of ICU on patients, the satisfaction levels of patients and family members increased by 6% with the changes due to a shift from a ward with multiple beds to a newly designed ICU with noise-reduced, single rooms with daylight and improved family facilities. 6 Patient and family psychological distress Surgical patients encounter physical trauma and psychological distress after surgery. 9 10 Psychological distress has been defined as a collective term for anxiety and depression levels. 11 Beyond that, an unfamiliar hospital environment, such as the ICU, is another stressful factor that is associated with high anxiety and depression levels. 12 In coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) patients, anxiety and depression occurs for several reasons: (1) routine procedures during ICU admission, for instance, oral and nasal tubes are important stressors 13 because they result in an inability to talk, affecting communication with ICU staff and (2) the associated time spent on the waiting list before the surgery. The prevalence of clinically significant anxiety and depression in patients awaiting CABG was 28% and 47%, respectively. 14 Results from a systematic review found that higher levels of preoperative anxiety and depression in CABG patients were predictive of psychological distress in the postoperative period. 15 Generally, family members were significantly more anxious than patients themselves about the cardiac surgery. 16 However, family members of the cardiac surgery patients reported lower level of anxiety and high satisfaction if their informational needs about the surgery and treatment of the patients were fulfilled. 17 ",

            "text": "Previous studies have shown that multimedia educational interventions can reduce anxiety and foster an understanding of the processes and risks of cardiac surgery for patients 18 and their family members, 17 regardless of the format to convey the patient education: using tape, 19 written leaflets 18 20 or verbally during the preoperative visit by ICU or specialist cardiac nurses. 18 20 Additionally, results from a multicentre study in a non-cardiac ICU 21 showed that disclosing all the available information in a frank, direct and empathetic way could meet the informational needs of family members about the patients and thus, they were more satisfied; conversely, families who felt that they had received contradictory information had 21.1% lower satisfaction scores than their counterparts. 21 Effect of patient education Having a preoperative patient education programme which provides sufficient information on the risk and process of surgery to patients may help to increase their satisfaction levels and reduce their anxiety levels. A randomised controlled trial 18 of a preoperative educational intervention (usual care plus information leaflet and verbal advice) versus usual care for patients undergoing cardiac surgery showed a moderate reduction in anxiety levels (adjusted mean difference \u22123.6, 95% CI \u22124.62 to \u22122.57) and depression levels (adjusted mean difference \u22122.1, 95% CI \u22123.19 to \u22120.92) using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Another recent study showed that an effective nurse-led preoperative education not only reduced anxiety levels, but also reduced the risk of postoperative complications, such as sternal infection, in cardiac surgical patients. 22 However, the evidence to support benefits from patient education in the ICU setting is mixed. In a recent multicentred randomised controlled trial of a structured information programme during the ICU stay as compared with a non-specific conversation of similar duration, there was no reduction in patient anxiety levels (mean difference \u22120.2, 95% CI \u22124.5 to 4.1, on a scale from 0 (no anxiety) to 100 (maximum anxiety)) in medical and surgical critically ill ICU patients. 23 In a cross-sectional study of family members visiting ICU patients, although there was a moderate correlation between family perception of informational support and satisfaction with care (r=0.74, p<0.001), very little correlation between informational support and anxiety levels (r=\u22120.13, p=0.50) was found. 24 Neither of the two studies provided information about the ICU before the ICU admission. 23 24 A non-randomised study examining the effect of a preoperative ICU tour prior to cardiac surgery failed to detect a significant difference in anxiety levels between the control (no ICU tour) and treatment (ICU tour) after adjusting for previous ICU experience ( p=0.43). 25 Nevertheless, the authors showed that patients in the treatment group perceived the tour to be beneficial for themselves and for future patients. 25 In addition, other studies found that in order to reduce psychological distress, both ICU nurses and patients believed that preoperative patient education led by ICU nurses explaining the reasons for ICU admission, ICU environment and the expected postoperative care would be beneficial. 26 27 Significance of the present study The previous studies discussed above have focused individually on the separate issues of satisfaction with general ICU care, preoperative psychological distress and informational needs related to surgical aspects of care. However, few have adequately examined the effect of educational interventions specifically targeting surgical issues and the postoperative ICU stay, or investigated the inter-relationships between patient education, patient and family satisfaction scores, and measures of anxiety and depression. This two-group, parallel, superiority, double-blinded randomised controlled trial will examine the effectiveness of a multifaceted patient education intervention on patient and family satisfaction, and postoperative anxiety and depression in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The primary objective is to determine the effect of the preoperative patient education package (video and ICU tour) for patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery on patient and family satisfaction with care and decision-making in the ICU. The second objective of the study is to determine the effect of preoperative patient education package on anxiety and depression levels in patients after elective cardiac surgery. The primary hypothesis is that preoperative patient education will increase both patient and family satisfaction levels after elective cardiac surgery, and the secondary hypothesis is that preoperative patient education will reduce patient anxiety and depression measures after cardiac surgery.",

The mean and SD of the patient and family satisfaction scores, and HADS anxiety and depression subscale scores will be reported. The mean differences between groups for satisfaction scores from patients' and family members' perspective will be analysed using independent t-tests. To address the ceiling effect of the satisfaction questionnaires, we will estimate the change in percentage of overall high satisfaction (score=100) between groups by using an empirical logit transformation as it is more difficult to improve from 80% to 90% than from 50% to 60%. 43 A generalised estimating equation population average regression will be used to examine the mean difference in anxiety and depression subscales between groups over time. As some patients and family members may be too apprehensive to join the preoperative ICU tour after the video intervention, we will perform a sensitivity analysis on the three groups (control, video only, video plus ICU tour) to examine how robust the results are. The level of significance will be set at p<0.05.",

A designated care team was formed, consisting of a group of ICU nurses who were trained in the postoperative care of cardiac surgical patients, as well as for conducting preoperative ICU site visits. The aim of the preoperative ICU visit was to decrease patients' anxiety levels due to unfamiliarity with the ICU environment and to have a better understanding of the immediate postoperative management in the ICU. As the feedback to the site visit by the healthcare team, patients and family members were positive, a preoperative video was developed in 2002. When severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak occurred in 2003, the video viewings and ICU tours stopped. We did not reinstitute the ICU education intervention after the outbreak.",

The video provides comprehensive and standardised preoperative information to patients and family members about ICU care to complement preoperative information given by other healthcare professionals working in the cardiac surgical ward. Early informal feedback from patients and family members in the treatment arm is positive, with a common theme that the intervention makes the perioperative pathway processes more transparent to them. This may help set more achievable recovery goals and expectations, and therefore affect satisfaction levels related to the healthcare provided. However, a limitation of the study is that the overall contact time in ICU is limited, in most cases to 24 hours after cardiac surgery. Also, we did not include family members' anxiety and depression levels due to the time constraints during visiting hours.",
