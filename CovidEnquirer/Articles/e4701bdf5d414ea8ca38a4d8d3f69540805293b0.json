The 2019-nCov is an betacoronavirus that possibly originated from wild animals that genome is highly homologous to bats 2 . Human-to-human transmission is the main way of cause infection 3 . The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it to be a public health emergency of international concern 4 . Until February 20, 2020, a total number of 75569 COVID-19 cases have been diagnosed in China, including 2239 deaths 5 . Despite the rapid spread over the world, the clinical features and laboratory inspection of COVID-19 keep largely unclear. The clinical characteristics of severe COVID-19 cases were similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS ) that could occur acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, and even death 6 .Whereas the main clinical features of COVID-19 patients are fever, cough and sore throat. However, there are few reports on the clinical features and laboratory detection results of NCP cases in every regions of Hubei province outside Wuhan. We aimed to through analyzed 128 laboratory confirmed cases of Xiangyang No. 1 Hospital to reveal the infectious characteristics of COVID-19 that provide more information for the research of novel coronavirus.",
