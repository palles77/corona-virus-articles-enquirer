Only one mAb is licensed for use against an infectious disease, although there are many in various stages of development. This situation is peculiar given that serum therapy was one of the first effective treatments for microbial diseases and that specific antibodies have numerous antimicrobial properties. The underdevelopment and underutilization of mAb therapies for microbial diseases has various complex explanations that include the current availability of antimicrobial drugs, small markets, high costs and microbial antigenic variation. However, there are signs that the climate for mAb therapeutics in infectious diseases is changing given increasing antibiotic drug resistance, the emergence of new pathogenic microbes for which no therapy is available, and development of mAb cocktail formulations. Currently, the major hurdle for the widespread introduction of mAb therapies for microbial diseases is economic, given the high costs of immunoglobulin preparations and relatively small markets. Despite these obstacles there are numerous opportunities for mAb development against microbial diseases and the development of radioimmunotherapy provides new options for enhancing the magic bullet. Hence, there is cautious optimism that the years ahead will see more mAbs in clinical use against microbial diseases.",

In the early 20th century serum therapy was used against a diverse range of infectious diseases, including pneumococcal pneumonia, meningococcal meningitis, erysipelas, anthrax and others [3, 4] . These successes established antibody therapy as a powerful tool against infectious disease. Unfortunately, the immunological complications associated with the use of heterologous sera in humans, such as serum sickness and immediate hypersensitivity, significantly limited its usefulness [4] . Importantly, the problems of serum therapy do not necessarily apply to mAb therapy. Technological developments, such as improved purification techniques and the ability to engineer humanized mAbs, have greatly reduced these complications, allowed for increased specificity and expanded the range of possible targets. However, for many infectious diseases the availability of antimicrobial therapy has proved to be too much competition, and that combined with the complexity of introducing mAbs to clinical practice has hindered the pace of mAb-based therapeutic advancements.",

Their work led to the first instance of industrial production of protective serum from sheep for human therapy in 1893 [10] and to the first Nobel Prize in Medicine for Behring. Immune animal sera from horses, sheep, and chickens were used to treat diseases where a protective immune response could be induced in the animal host by vaccination. In cases where humans were the only hosts, such as viral diseases, human convalescent sera were successfully used. For example, in the early 1900s, serum from individuals who recovered from measles was used to treat and prevent infection. Until the 1930s, serum from animals or people was collected and pooled to treat a number of infections, from streptococcal infection to toxin-mediated diseases like diphtheria [11] . Overall, serum was effective, and for some diseases like pneumococcal pneumonia and meningococcal meningitis, the prompt administration of serum was associated with significantly improved survival [3] .",

Antibiotics were easier to manufacture, had less toxicity in patients and produced more consistent results. In contrast to serum therapy, which depended on animal sources that exhibited great lot-to-lot variation, antibiotics were the products of industrial processes and could be formulated in preparations with consistent activity. Furthermore, serum therapy was generally effective only early in the course of infection while antibiotic therapy maintained efficacy even when given late in the course of a microbial disease. Another advantage of antibiotic therapy was that it could be used without a specific diagnosis while the use of antibody therapy required knowledge of the pathogen responsible for disease. Consequently, serum therapy was unable to compete with antibiotics, and the development of new broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy displaced antibody-based therapies (Table 1) .",

This point is important because it illustrated that antibody therapy can thrive in certain situations where it lacked competition, such as in the treatment of diseases which have no other effective therapies. For example, antibody preparations continue to be used to prevent rabies and toxicity from snakebite venoms. In developed countries serum therapy was often replaced by hyperimmune serum from pooled human donors. Today, hyperimmune human sera immunoglobulin is used to treat many diseases including those caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), rabies, vaccinia, vesicular stomatitis virus (VZV), and measles, underscoring the fact that antibody therapy remains an effective means of treatment [6, 12] .",

            "text": "Compared to hyperimmune sera, or even to modern antibiotics, mAb therapy has many advantages and some disadvantages ( Table 1) . mAbs inherently have a high specificity for their target and, since microbes are generally antigenically distinct from humans, the cross-reactivity with host tissues is minimal. In contrast to antibiotics, which target both harmful microbes and the host flora, mAbs will only target a specific microbe and their systemic administration should not affect other resident beneficial microbes. This could prove to be a significant advantage given increasing reports associating certain chronic diseases such as asthma, atopy, and even certain forms of cancer with antimicrobial drug use [13, 14] . Microbial specificity means that mAbs are unlikely to select for drug-resistant microbes among nontargeted microbes. The ability to specifically target disease-causing microbial populations without selecting for resistance makes mAb therapy potentially superior to current broad-spectrum antibiotics that are generally used in therapy, at least for microbial diseases caused by single microbes. The increasing prevalence and rising cost of treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA), and other resistant infections in both nosocomial and community settings emphasizes the need to develop new strategies for controlling infections.",

In contrast, mAb preparations consist of one type of immunoglobulin with a defined specificity and a single isotype. This represents both an advantage and a disadvantage when mAbs are compared to polyclonal preparations. One advantage is that mAbs, by virtue of the fact that they are chemically defined reagents, exhibit relatively low lot-to-lot variability in contrast to polyclonal preparations, which can differ over time and by source of origin since different hosts mount different antibody responses. Another advantage for mAb preparations is a much greater activity per mass of protein since all the immunoglobulin molecules are specific for the desired target. This phenomenon is illustrated by the report that two 0.7 mg doses of two mAbs provided the same protection against tetanus [15] . However, mAb preparations lack variability with regards to epitope and isotype, and consequently polyclonal preparations have potentially greater biological activity by targeting multiple microbial epitopes and providing various effector functions through different isotypes.",

Current technology makes the production of mAbs relatively easy and effective, requiring only tissue culture or microbial expression systems, as opposed to the live human or animal donors that were required for serum therapy. Hence, the potential toxicity of human and humanized mAbs is comparable to antibiotics and lower than serum therapy, especially heterologous preparations. mAb therapies are also much less likely to inadvertently transmit other infectious diseases. However, antibody therapies remain very costly relative to antimicrobial drugs. Consequently, mAbs are unlikely to successfully compete with antimicrobial drugs against diseases for which cheap effective therapy is available unless a clear superiority is established for the immunoglobulin therapy alone or in combination with conventional antimicrobial therapy. The fact that specific antibodies are often synergistic with conventional antimicrobial therapy suggests that combination therapy with current antimicrobial regimens may confer potential advantages relative to either alone [16, 17] . Not only can mAbs make antibiotics more effective, but the research driving mAb development can also enhance other areas, such as identifying new targets for vaccine development [18, 19] . In this regard, efforts to develop mAb-based therapies have the potential of impacting many aspects of infectious disease medicine. Furthermore, some mAbs can be effective in immunocompromised hosts, as evidenced by the efficacy of palivizumab in reducing hospitalizations for RSV-associated disease in preterm infants [20] . Even in the setting of reduced immune response, mAbs can function to replace lost immunity or benefit the host by direct activity, such as neutralization. Consequently, mAbs are an attractive alternative alone or as adjuncts to current antimicrobial therapy that will be effective in hosts with different states of immunity.",

Antibodies are macromolecules that are fragile, perishable and require refrigeration, each of which contributes to their high cost. Furthermore, most mAbs require systemic administration, which complicates their delivery in many clinical settings. Finally, a mAb usually cannot be used until a specific diagnosis is made. In an era when broadspectrum antibiotics are relied upon so heavily, treatment is often begun before diagnostic identification of a disease-causing microbe is made [5] . However, recent advances in rapid diagnostic techniques provide hope for earlier specific diagnosis, which is essential for making mAb treatments more realizable. Even so, based on experience with serum therapy, one could anticipate that a mAb will only be effective when administered relatively early in the course of infection. A decrease in antibody efficacy over time occurs quickly as the duration of infection increases, highlighting the need for rapid diagnosis and treatment initiation.",

            "text": "Another, theoretical drawback to mAb therapy is that these reagents, by definition, target a single epitope, and provide one type of effector function corresponding to their isotype. Although the specificity of mAbs is a strength, a microbe that undergoes rapid antigenic variation poses a significant hurdle for mAb development. For example, the high mutation rate of certain viruses enables them to escape neutralization. There are numerous examples in the literature where experimental mAb therapy has resulted in the emergence of escape variants as a result of microbial mutation and/or microevolution [21] [22] [23] . This problem may be counterbalanced by selecting mAbs that target conserved areas of viral particles or by using mixtures of mAbs that target various epitopes. For example, combination therapy with mAb cocktails prevents escape variants for many viruses including influenza [24] , coronavirus [25] , and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) [26] . Although cocktails are effective in providing protection against the emergence of resistant mutants, the inclusion of multiple immunoglobulins in any therapeutic formulation is fraught with complex regulatory and licensing issues. Nevertheless, progress in overcoming these burdensome regulatory issues is evidenced by the recent development of a mAb mixture for the prophylaxis of rabies that targets several virus types [27] . Indeed, as polyclonal sera may be beneficial due to the presence of multiple protective antibodies, a cocktail of functional mAbs could provide more protection and target more microbial strains than a single one. As experience with mAb cocktails accumulates it may be possible to design therapeutic combinations that include multiple effector functions in the form of different isotypes and epitope specificities.",

The antigenic differences between the host and the microbe make mAb development for infectious diseases easier than for cancer or immunity fields, where the target is often a self-antigen that is differentially expressed in transformed cells. Additionally, mAbs have direct and indirect antimicrobial mechanisms of action. Direct mechanisms include neutralizing toxins or binding to viruses to prevent host cell entry. Recently mAbs have also been shown to be directly bactericidal [30] .

It received regulatory approval in 1998. Prior to palivizumab, prophylaxis of RSV disease depended on RespiGam, or RSV-IGIV, a prophylactic polyclonal RSV hyperimmune serum [1] . This prior polyclonal preparation was plagued by low specific activity, and effective dosing required the administration of large volumes of antibody, which was problematic in low weight infants. Palivizumab obviated this problem since it had 50-fold greater potency than the polyclonal serum, and this example shows how greater specific activity can translate into a superior product. The greater potency significantly reduced the volume needed to deliver a therapeutic dose to an infant and has improved treatment while avoiding the side effects of pooled serum.",

Mothers carrying GBS are routinely treated with antibiotics and this has resulted in a dramatic reduction in neonatal disease. However, antibiotic therapy affects the infant microflora and has been epidemiologically linked to the development of atopy and asthma in children [14] . Furthermore, prophylactic antibiotic therapy can select for resistant microbes or disturb the flora in a manner that could make colonization with resistant microbes more likely, could be followed by superinfections, and may even have untoward consequences later in life [5] . Passive antibody therapy against GBS is also effective [32] and not encumbered by the problems of altered flora and its consequences. Hence, the economics of passive antibody and antibiotic prophylaxis are more nuanced than simply valuing the different alternatives. A truer cost comparison must take into account the complications that follow broad-spectrum therapy.",

In general, most efforts to develop antibody-based therapies have focused on diseases where the humoral immune system was known to make a strong contribution to host defense. For these microbial diseases the efficacy of humoral immunity was implied from demonstration of passive antibody protection and/or correlation of specific antibody with resistance to disease. However, recent work has established that mAbs are effective even against microbes for which the standard studies do not clearly establish a role for humoral immunity [33] . For example, several mAbs have now been generated that are effective against intracellular pathogens and other microbes where natural Ab is not believed to have a primary role in host defense [33] . Overall, diseases which are currently not preventable by vaccination or that target populations with weak immune systems (for example, the very young or old, and immunosuppressed or immunocompromised patients) are the most valuable for which to develop mAb therapies. Here, both viral and bacterial toxin diseases that are the target of mAb development will be discussed, as well as potential targets based on need toward which efforts should be focused in the future.

Hepatitis remains the leading indication for liver transplant, and viral reinfection of the transplanted liver is a major complication. Two different monoclonal antibodies are in clinical trials for the improving transplant success, of which neither are specific for the virus itself. Both bavituximab, specific for phosphatidylserine, a phospholipid exposed on membranes of damaged cells, and MDX-1106, specific for PD-1, an inhibitory T cell costimulation receptor, have been used to control chronic hepatitis infection, particularly in the setting of HIV-coinfection [34, 43] . The threat of a new pandemic makes influenza virus an important candidate for mAb development, with research currently being done to characterize human neutralizing antibodies and explore their therapeutic potential [24, 44, 45] . Historically, influenza virus has been extremely challenging because of its high antigenic variability. However, progress has been made in identifying antibodies that are broadly neutralizing [46, 47] . In the event of a new pandemic mAbs could provide important options for disease control since they confer immediate immunity and may be used as prophylaxis for individuals who are likely to have been exposed to infection. Considerable excitement followed the discovery of a broadly cross-reactive antibody specific for HA2 of influenza A that allows the neutralization of different viral strains, including avian H5N1 and human H1N1 [48] . Technology now exists where plasma cells secreting influenza-specific antibody can be cloned from human donors and used to generate high affinity mAbs within a matter of weeks [49] .",

By early 2004, neutralizing human mAbs had been developed and were being tested by laboratories [55] , illustrating the potential speed of bench-to-bedside transition. Human mAbs have been developed to the Hendra and Nipah viruses, which are both paramyxoviruses that can cause fatal hemorrhagic fevers and were responsible for outbreaks in the late 1990s [56, 57] .

Anthrax is an example of one such disease, where current treatment recommendations are inadequate, as the anthrax vaccine is currently not indicated for post-exposure prophylaxis and antibiotic-resistant strains of Bacillus anthracis are a rising concern [74] . Protective antigen (PA) is the common subunit to the two dimeric anthrax toxins, where PA pairs with edema factor (EF) or lethal factor (LF) to form cellular toxins mediating edema and cell death, respectively. The two mAbs specific for PA currently in clinical trials are anthim, which was just announced to be restarting phase I clinical trials, and raxibacumab, which is currently maintained by the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile. Toxins from Clostridium botulinum are another example of extremely potent neurotoxins that can lead to fatal respiratory disease and are capable of being weaponized. Development of mAbs to neutralize these toxins for post-exposure treatment is an important avenue of research.",

This approach could be developed for the treatment of drug-resistant HIV strains [93] . The efficacy of RIT for treatment of HIV infection in vivo was explored with a radiolabeled HIV envelope-specific human anti-gp41 mAb 246-D radiolabeled with 213 Bi and 188 Re [89] . For these studies human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) infected with HIV-1 JR-CSF were injected into the spleens of SCID mice and the mice were treated with RIT. Treatment of mice with 188 Re-labeled mAb 246-D administered either before or after intrasplenic injection with HIV-1 JR-CSF -infected human PBMCs dramatically reduced the number of HIV-1-infected cells. Similar results were obtained after treatment of mice with 213 Bi-246-D. Administration of equivalent amounts of \"cold\" mAb 246-D or of a radioisotope-coupled irrelevant control mAb did not reduce the average number of infected cells detected in the SCID mouse spleens. The demonstration of efficacy of RIT against HIV provided a proof-of-principle for the concept of treating viral infections by targeting viral-infected cells and this approach could potentially be applied to other chronic viral diseases like hepatitis C.",

            "text": "Considering the breadth of research into new targets for microbial mAbs, as well as the vast need for new therapeutic modalities for infectious diseases, this area of medicine is a growing field. There are many new approaches to improving the efficacy of mAbs, such as using cocktails of mAbs or combining mAbs with existing drugs for synergistic effects. There are also many new research developments that will expand the possibilities for mAb drugs. The next generation of mAbs could be developed against novel targets, such as quorum sensing molecules, which regulate bacterial growth and virulence factor expression [96] , or type III secretion systems, which are used by a subset of microbes to infect host cells [97] . To fight MDR bacteria, some successful approaches have targeted the cellular efflux pumps responsible for antibiotic resistance [98] . In general, more of these types of \"broad-spectrum\" mAbs will enable a therapeutic mAb to be developed which could be useful against a number of microbes, thus extending its market and increasing its profit potential. Bavituximab is an example of one such mAb, specific for phospholipids on the exposed inner surface of damaged cells, where potential applications include both HIV and HCV [34] . Progress has also been made generating mAbs that have bispecificity, where mAb variants are selected that bind to multiple microbial epitopes [99] . Finally, more direct engineering of mAbs could result in enhanced efficacy, such as Fc region alterations that can extend serum half-life or influence effector function [100] . For example, alterations in Fc region glycosylation can increase antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) [101] . Although this review has focused on the use of intact mAbs against microbial diseases, we note that for some microbes the Fc region is not necessary for efficacy, providing numerous additional therapeutic options. For example, mAb fragments which lack Fc regions can be effective in situations where effector cell function is not necessary, for example in inhibiting HIV entry [102] .",
