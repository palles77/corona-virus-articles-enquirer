            "text": "Viruses are widely used as vectors for heterologous gene expression in cultured cells or natural hosts, and therefore a large number of viruses with exogenous sequences inserted into their genomes have been engineered. Many of these engineered viruses are viable and express heterologous proteins at high levels, but the inserted sequences often prove to be unstable over time and are rapidly lost, limiting heterologous protein expression. Although virologists are aware that inserted sequences can be unstable, processes leading to insert instability are rarely considered from an evolutionary perspective. Here, we review experimental work on the stability of inserted sequences over a broad range of viruses, and we present some theoretical considerations concerning insert stability. Different virus genome organizations strongly impact insert stability, and factors such as the position of insertion can have a strong effect. In addition, we argue that insert stability not only depends on the characteristics of a particular genome, but that it will also depend on the host environment and the demography of a virus population. The interplay between all factors affecting stability is complex, which makes it challenging to develop a general model to predict the stability of genomic insertions. We highlight key questions and future directions, finding that insert stability is a surprisingly complex problem and that there is need for mechanism-based, predictive models. Combining theoretical models with experimental tests for stability under varying conditions can lead to improved engineering of viral modified genomes, which is a valuable tool for understanding genome evolution as well as for biotechnological applications, such as gene therapy.",

            "text": "A large number of virus genomes have been engineered to carry additional sequences for a variety of purposes. Viruses are often used as vectors for heterologous gene expression in cultured cells or the natural host. For example, the baculovirus expression system is widely used for expression work (Chambers et al. 2018 ), lentiviruses show great promise for gene therapy (Milone and O'Doherty 2018) , and phage display allows for selection of desired epitopes (Wu et al. 2016) . Marker genes have also been built into viruses to facilitate tracking infection spread (Dolja, McBride, and Carrington 1992) . As viruses evolve rapidly, including the incorporation of genome-rearrangements, it is therefore unsurprising that the insertion of sequences into viral genomes often goes hand in hand with the rapid occurrence of deletions (Koonin, Dolja, and Morris 1993; Pijlman et al. 2001; Zwart et al. 2014 ). The inserted sequence, and sometimes parts of the viral genome, are then rapidly lost. This genomic instability can have economic ramifications, leading to decreases in heterologous protein expression (Kool et al. 1991; De Gooijer et al. 1992; Scholthof, Scholthof, V C The Author(s) 2019.

It can also introduce limitations and complications to working with marker genes Majer, Dar\u00f2 s, and Zwart 2013) . Understanding the stability of inserted sequences therefore has value from an applied perspective, but it could also shed light on basic questions. First, how stable are natural virus genomes, and under what conditions do they become unstable? Second, since horizontal gene transfer (HGT) plays an important role in virus evolution, under what conditions are transferred sequences likely to be retained?",

Our primary focus is on engineered viruses: studies where gene insertions are an addition to the viral genome (leading to an increase in genome size) and where the subsequent fate of these inserted sequences has been tracked. As inserted sequences can incur a fitness cost, these are often quickly purged from the viral genome. Often these fitness costs are related to a disruption of the viral genome (e.g. gene order). We therefore also consider studies on genome rearrangements in wild viruses and introduce other relevant modifications that shed light on what the impact of genomic inserts can be.

The diversity in this region is needed for immune evasion and for the colonization of novel hosts and appears to be mainly regulated by recombination events. However, other processes such as mutation leading to accelerated rates of recombination cannot be ruled out. Poxviruses, such as vaccinia, virus are classified as nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs). These viruses have larger than average genome sizes and the more recently discovered giant viruses are also classified as such. The NCLDVs appear to have undergone a dynamic evolution where gene gain and loss events go in parallel with host-switches between animal and protist hosts (Koonin and Yutin 2018) . Interestingly, the phylogenomic reconstructions performed by Koonin and Yutin (2018) suggest that giant viruses (for which the host range appears to be restricted to protists) have evolved from simpler viruses (infecting animals) on many independent occasions. This again suggests that the host plays an important role in genome stability where in animals the pressure for smaller virus genomes is stronger than in protists (Koonin and Yutin 2018) .",

Among dsDNA phages, lambdaviruses of E.coli were widely used as cloning vectors, and methods were developed to increase the stability and maximum size of inserts (Chauthaiwale, Therwath, and Deshpande 1992) . One interesting approach made use of the fact that there is a minimum genome size for efficient packaging into virus particles. When endogenous genes that are non-essential for the lytic cycle are removed, not only can larger sequences be inserted, but there is also selection for maintaining the inserted sequences because they increase genome size and enable packaging (Thomas, Cameron, and Davis 1974) . Moreover, it has been shown that phage T7 engineered with a biofilm-degrading enzyme (dispersin B) was superior to unmodified phage at clearing short-term biofilms (Lu and Collins 2007) . Although providing a 'public' benefit in the form of an exoenzyme that can degrade host defenses, surprisingly this insertion does not have a cost and is therefore stable (Schmerer et al. 2014) . Interestingly, the insertion of an endosialidase at the same locus was both beneficial and costly, although in this case evolutionary stability was not determined (Gladstone, Molineux, and Bull 2012) .",

During the course of geminivirus infection in plants, shorter subgenomic DNAs often arise. These subgenomic DNAs can range in size and some result in defective DNAs (Stenger et al. 1992; Stanley et al. 1997; Patil et al. 2007) , that replicate at the expense of the full-length genome. These subgenomic DNAs can lead to reduced symptom severity in plants and thereby act as modulators of viral pathogenicity. It is speculated that the (sometimes stepwise) deletion process leading to subgenomic DNAs can also be the process leading to the reversion to wild-type full-length DNA molecules with either insertions or deletions that make these bigger or smaller than the wild-type genome (Martin et al. 2011 ).",

A lower frequency would also entail a lower mutational supply, limiting evolvability, the capacity of the virus to generate beneficial variation and subsequently adapt.

Most of the dsRNA viruses contain segmented genomes, where during replication, positivesense ssRNAs are packaged into procapsids and serve as templates for dsRNA synthesis. Thus, the progeny particles contain a complete set of equimolar genome segments. Proper recognition and stoichiometrical packaging of the ssRNAs is indispensable for multi-segmented genome assembly. Although, different dsRNA viruses employ different mechanisms for this assembly, these all rely on proper recognition of the ssRNAs in either specific RNA-protein or RNA-RNA interactions (Borodavka, Desselberger, and Patton 2018) . We therefore expect that dsRNA virus genomes are highly streamlined, since most gene insertions will probably disturb the recognition and packaging process of the ssRNAs. Interestingly, for rotaviruses it has been observed that genome segments containing sequence duplications are preferentially packaged into progeny viruses relative to wild-type segments (Troupin et al. 2011) , indicating that an increase in genome/segment size may not be a hard constraint. We hypothesize that few if any gene insertions will lead to viable genomes due to the perturbation of segmented genome assembly into virus particles. If a gene insertion happens to be viable, it will probably be rapidly purged from the viral genome. One exception to this hypothesis could be a gene insertion originating from a closely related virus, for example a virus with similar packaging signals, leading to a fitness advantage, such as increased packaging efficiency.",

However, the nature of the ssRNA(\u00fe) genomes poses several limitations to efficient expression and maintenance of the insert. Most ssRNA(\u00fe) genomes used for the expression of foreign genes code for a polyprotein, a single ORF that is further processed after translation into different mature peptides. The processing occurs through autocatalytic cleaving at specific cleavage sites located between the different proteins to be expressed. Insertions should therefore be carefully engineered, including proper cleavage sites corresponding to the site of insertion. Even when respecting these design rules, inserts may impose restriction on viral replication due to the failure of proper protease cleavage due to conformational constraints. In addition, the genomes of RNA viruses tend to be composed of overlapping genes (Belshaw, Pybus, and Rambaut 2007) , which limits their adaptive capacity (Simon-Loriere, Holmes, and Pag\u00e1 n 2013). Overlap can form an impediment to engineering, and perhaps to the likelihood an inserted sequence is maintained, as insertions will often affect multiple genes. We focus exclusively on engineered viruses, given that there are many examples for this virus group.",

Insertions of up to 534 bp of the rotavirus VP7 gene into Sabin 3 poliovirus gave rise to infectious viruses that expressed portions of the VP7 outer capsid protein (Mattion et al. 1994 ). This is promising as antibodies generated to VP7 are able to neutralize the virus. Nevertheless the size of the insert in this construction is limited as only inserts of about 300 bp or smaller were stable upon serial passages in tissue culture, whereas larger insertions failed to produce infectious viruses (Mattion et al. 1994 ). One of the major limitations appears to be the polyprotein nature of the genome. The recombinant viruses expressing the inserted gene were found to be slower in the assembly of infectious virus particles, and showed smaller plaques and lower virus titers. This is possibly due to slow cleavage at the artificial cleavage sites around the insert (Mattion et al. 1994) . Sindbis virus, another ssRNA(\u00fe) virus genome that encodes for a single ORF, accepted relatively large inserts of 3.2 kbp in the 11.8 kbp genome (Pugachev et al. 1995) . However, the recombinant Sindbis viruses appeared unstable and especially inserts at the 3 0 end were rapidly lost during serial passages, suggesting a positional effect.",

To cope with these issues, recombinant Flaviviridae viruses carrying the split-luciferase gene were generated (Tamura et al. 2018 ), including dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, HCV and bovine viral diarrhea virus. In vitro, these recombinant viruses appear to be evolutionary stable and propagation was comparable to the wild-type virus, most probably due to the small 11 amino acid insert size. To demonstrate the utility of the split reporter system-to determine in vivo viral dynamics and the efficacy of antiviral reagents-the recombinant HCV was tested in chimeric mice. Chronic infection was established and the luciferase gene was stably maintained in the viral genome (Tamura et al. 2018) .",

And second, the DHFR gene (238 bp) inserted in a TMV background appears to be maintained stably through several passages, while the 3.5\u00c2 larger NPT gene (832 bp) in the same experimental setup was unstable during systemic movement of the virus. This may also be related to the nature of the insert, where sequences with a codon usage similar to that of the viral vector may be retained longer than those that have an opposite codon usage. Interestingly, Chung, Canto, and Palukaitis (2007) generated recombinant plant viruses with inserted genes of unrelated plant viruses and observed instability and variation in the rate of partial or complete loss of the insert depending on the inserted sequence itself, the host used, or the viral vector used (Chung, Canto, and Palukaitis 2007) . Also sequences with a high toxicity for the host, are more likely to become deleted faster or to impede viral replication.",

In this case eGFP can be considered a non-functional sequence, as it does not add any function to the viral genome. We showed that eGFP has a high fitness cost in TEV, and the loss of eGFP depended on the passage length, where longer passages led to a faster and assured loss. Similarly, prolonged propagation of TEV and plum pox potyvirus expressing GUS (Dolja, McBride, and Carrington 1992; Dolja et al. 1993; Guo, L\u00f3 pez-Moya, and Garc\u00eda 1998) , and TMV expressing GFP (Rabindran and Dawson 2001) , led to the appearance of spontaneous deletion variants. Due to the increase in genome size, viruses that carry an insert are unlikely to be as fit as the parental (ancestral) virus, even if they accumulate initially to similar levels. The TEV-eGFP genomes that had lost the insert had a within-host competitive fitness advantage, where the smaller the genome the higher the within-host competitive fitness. Interestingly, although the size of the deletions varied, convergent evolution did occur in terms of fixed point mutations (Zwart et al. 2014) . This result also suggests that a demographic 'sweet spot' exists, where heterologous insertions are not immediately lost while evolution can act to integrate them into the viral genome. In summary, in several studies passage duration has an effect on insert stability, with inserts being more stable in shorter passages. We explore these effects in the conceptual section presented at the end of this paper (see also Box 1).",

The difference in fitness between the virus with insertion and without is large (x I =x D \u00bc 0:8). The simulation data illustrate how under these conditions narrow bottlenecks can lead to stable inserted sequence (Fig. 2) . During each round of passaging the frequency of the deletion variant comes up, but as it does not reach a frequency near 1/a this variant is not sampled during the bottleneck. Only when the bottleneck is wider is the probability of sampling the virus variant with a deletion large enough for this to occur regularly. Once a deletion variant has been sampled during the bottleneck, it rapidly goes to fixation as it has a much higher fitness than the full-length virus. Figure 1 provides a simple illustration of the same principle.",

A fitness costs of eGFP was only found in the host for which TEV has low virulence. In the hosts for which TEV has high virulence there was no fitness cost and viral adaptation was observed. This contradicts theories that suggest that high virulence could hinder between-host transmission. When considering the evolution of genome architecture, host species jumps might play a very important role, by allowing evolutionary intermediates to be competitive. The stability of an insert could change when considering insertions that might be beneficial for the virus. Using the TEV genome we simulated two HGT events, by separately introducing functional exogenous sequences that are potentially beneficial for the virus (Willemsen et al. 2017 ). In one case, the insertion was rapidly purged from the viral genome, restoring fitness to wild-type fitness levels. In another case, the inserted gene-the 2b RNA silencing suppressor from Cucumber mosaic virus-did not seem to have a major impact on viral fitness and was therefore not lost when performing experimental evolution. Interestingly this insertion duplicated the function of RNA silencing suppression function of another gene in the genome. When mutating this functional domain of the TEV gene, the inserted gene provided a replicative advantage. These observations suggest a potentially interesting role for HGT of short functional sequences in improving evolutionary constraints on viruses.",

On one hand, one would expect the duplicated copy to be rapidly deleted from the genome as it does not confer an additional function. On the other hand, if a duplicated sequence is stable it may act as a stepping stone to the evolution of new biological functions. We have investigated the stability of genetically redundant sequences by generating (TEV) viruses with potentially beneficial gene duplications (Willemsen et al. 2016 ). All gene duplications resulted in a loss of viability or in a significant reduction in viral fitness. Experimental evolution always led to deletion of the duplicated gene copy and maintenance of the ancestral copy. However, the stability of the different duplicated genes was highly divergent, suggesting that passage duration is not the main factor for determining whether the insert will be stable or unstable. The deletion dynamics of the duplicated genes were associated with the passage duration and the size of the duplicated copy. By developing a mathematical model we showed that the fitness effects alone are not enough to predict genomic stability. A context-dependent recombination rate is also required, with the context being the identity of the insert and its position.",

While in ssRNA(\u00fe) viruses inserts are subject to deletion, inserts in their ssRNA(\u00c0) counterparts appear more stable (Mebatsion et al.1996; Schnell et al. 1996) . One reason for this stability is that in general the genes in the ssRNA(\u00c0) viral genomes are non-overlapping and are expressed as separate mRNAs, thus consisting of a modular organization that can be easily manipulated for the insertion of foreign genes. If correctly engineered (e.g. without affecting any regulatory regions), one could expect that gene insertions are more stable in ssRNA(\u00c0) viruses as compared to ssRNA(\u00fe) viruses, since the complexities surrounding correct processing of a polyprotein are not an issue here. Moreover, if expressed as a separate mRNA, the size of the insert is probably restricted only by the packaging limits of ssRNA(\u00c0) viruses. The low rate of homologous recombination in ssRNA(\u00c0) viruses can be another explanation for higher genomic stability (Chare, Gould, and Holmes 2003; Han and Worobey 2011) . Non-homologous recombination will probably rarely lead to variants with the insert deleted and other regions undisturbed, given it is less constrained than homologous recombination, and hence low homologous recombination rates could be a limiting factor on sequence evolution. However, genomic deletions that disrupt the inserted sequence will be subject to less constraints, as for example they can disrupt the reading frame of the insert without affecting the expression of virus genes.",

While in vivo no such size-dependent effect was observed, an attenuated replication and pathogenicity were detected (Sakai et al. 1999) . Insertions up to 3.9 kbp in the $15.4 kbp genome of the human parainfluenza virus 3 were viable and replicated efficiently in vitro (Skiadopoulos et al. 2000) .

After entering a host cell, the retroviral RNA genome is converted into dsDNA by reverse transcription. The viral DNA integrates into the host genome, where viral genes are translated. Therefore, these viruses are often used for gene therapy. Retroviruses frequently undergo genomic rearrangements, including gene insertions and deletions (indels). Moreover, recombination can be common due to the combination of 'diploid' virus particles and high intrinsic recombination rates (Jetzt et al. 2000) . Therefore as a general observation this viral group appears to have a highly plastic genome, and should be relatively open to foreign gene insertions. As retroviruses integrate into the host genome, the stability of inserts does not necessarily depend solely on the retrovirus genome configuration and demographic conditions. As host genomes are in general less streamlined than those of viruses, one could expect that gene insertions are stable after integration into the host genome. However, the random integration of retroviruses in the host genome makes it hard to predict genomic stability.",

For the Hepadnaviridae, the viral genome can be integrated into the host genome, through a process that exploits ds breaks in the host genome. Although this is an infrequent event, the integrated viral DNA often contains deletion, inversions and duplications, often inactivating the virus. In the case of Hepatitis B virus (HBV), integration into the human genome can cause genetic damage and chromosomal instability leading to HBV-induced liver cancer (Shafritz et al.1981; Furuta et al. 2018 ).",

In two of these studies, functional bacterial genes were introduced into the CaMV genome, where a fragment of the lac operator (Gronenborn et al. 1981 ) and the DHFR gene (Brisson et al. 1984) were successfully expressed. In these studies, issues regarding the stability of the insert were raised, where the lac operator was lost after five successive transfers and extended growth of the plants, and deletions in the DHFR gene started appearing after the second and third transfers. On the contrary, an inserted mammalian metallothionein gene appeared to be stable and functional in the CaMV genome (Lefebvre, Miki, and Lalibert\u00e9 1987) . These studies suggest that the differences in stability of inserts in the CaMV genome depend on at least two factors. First, the site of the insert seems to be important as many inserts are lethal for the virus (Gronenborn et al. 1981; Howell, Walker, and Walden 1981; Dixon, Koenig, and Hohn 1983) . Second, the size of the insert is important, as CaMV can accept only small foreign genes due to viral encapsidation limits (Gronenborn et al. 1981; Lefebvre, Miki, and Lalibert\u00e9 1987) .",

To cope with the size limitation a split GFP system has been engineered (Cabantous, Terwilliger, and Waldo 2005) , where only a small part of GFP is introduced in the viral vector and the other part is expressed using a transgenic host. When the two GFP fragments are together, spontaneous association leads the formation of a fluorescent molecule. In the CaMV genome this system allowed to track a CaMV protein in vivo (D\u00e1 der et al. 2019). The partial GFP insertion was stable for ten or four serial passages, depending on the host plant species used, suggesting that the demographic conditions such as the host play an important role in stability.",

First, the supply of mutations removing the insertion is crucial, because selection can only act on existing heritable variation. Second, selection then acts to fix variants with the inserted sequence removed. All other things equal, the larger the supply of mutations that remove the insertion and the larger the selection coefficients of variants with the insert removed, the less stable the insertion will be. The interplay between mutation and selection will govern the stability of genomic inserts, and in many cases demography has an important role in shaping this interplay. For example, low fitness can lead to small population sizes, which in turn will limit the mutation supply (Chao 1990; Lynch and Gabriel 1990) .

This idea is inspired by the empirical observation that a group IV plant virus appears to be stable when shortduration passages are used, but not in long-duration passages Zwart et al. 2014; Willemsen et al. 2016 Willemsen et al. , 2018 . Viruses pass through bottlenecks at many points during infection, in vitro and in vivo (Zwart and Elena 2015) , it is therefore important to consider these effects. Even if there is a large supply of deletions and strong selection for the deletion mutant, if deletion mutants fail to reach a frequency !/a, where a is the bottleneck size, they are unlikely to pass through the bottleneck (Willemsen et al. 2016 (Willemsen et al. , 2018 . This leads to a 'resetting' of the virus population by each bottleneck event (Fig. 1) , effectively resulting in high stability of the inserted sequences (Box 1, see also Fig. 2 ). Short passages shorten the time for deletion mutants to reach the frequency 1/a, making it more difficult for these variants to pass through bottlenecks and hereby promoting insert stability. It is important to remember that assays for detecting deletion mutants, such as deep sequencing or the polymerase chain reaction, do have limited sensitivity. Deletions may therefore also be detected more readily in longer passages, whilst low frequency mutations that will be purged by bottlenecks may not be detected (Bull, Nuismer, and Antia 2019) .",

The MOI (cellular multiplicity of infection) is a key demographic parameter at the cellular level, as it describes the number of virus particles infecting a cell. If an inserted sequence affects viral fitness in trans at the within cell level-for example by being toxic-then the MOI will determine whether there can be selection (Miyashita and Kishino 2010) . At high MOIs there will be no selection, because the toxin is produced in all cells and affects the replication of both producers and nonproducers of the toxin (Fig. 3 ). An interesting conundrum is that high MOIs also tend to promote the evolution of DI viruses (Huang 1973) due to within-cell selection, and hence these two effects must be weighed accordingly.",

Beneficial effects could promote insertion stability and are therefore interesting from a bioengineering perspective, but demography can once again play a role in determining sequence stability. Heterologous expression of endosialidase, an exoenzyme that degrades a key biofilm component after phageinduced cell lysis, lead to increased amplification of phage T7 in capsulated E.coli (Gladstone, Molineux, and Bull 2012) . However, a phage that did not express the dispersin outcompeted the engineered virus, as it could reap the benefits of dispersin production whilst not bearing costs. This tragedy of the commons is a reversal of the situation sketched above for high MOIs (Fig. 3) . One proposed strategy to increase stability would be setting up culture conditions such that phages are growing in isolation or spatially structured environments (Gladstone, Molineux, and Bull 2012) , other examples of demography-based approaches to increasing insert stability.",

For example, consider that recombination rates are high for many viruses (Tromas and Elena 2010) , and there are many Figure 3 . In panel A, we illustrate how the cellular MOI can have a direct effect on selection strength. Consider a virus that expresses a product that is toxic and acts in trans within cells to lower replication levels, but deletions can remove the gene coding this gene. If there is a mixed virus population with variants with the insertion intact and deleted, at high MOI all cells will be infected with both variants and the toxin will lower replication. The ubiquitousness of the toxin will limit selection against the virus variant with the deletion. When MOI is low, due to genetic drift at the cellular not all cells will contain both variants, and virus variant with the deletion is selected because those cells infected only with this variant have higher replication. In panel B, the relationship between the cellular MOI (ordinate) and the frequency of single-genotype infection (abscissa) for a virus population with genotypes a and b is given, for different frequencies of the two virus genotypes in the population (f a shown, f b \u00bc 1 -f a ). Note that the frequency of single-genotype infections is given as the proportion of infected cells in which only virus genotypes a or b are present. As the MOI increases, the frequency of single-genotype infections decreases, although it depends on the frequency of the two virus genotypes in the population. If genotype a expresses a gene that has fitness costs that act in trans (e.g. toxicity), then selection can only act against this genotype when there is an appreciable number of singlegenotype infections. possible recombination events that partially remove an insertion. In contrast, probably only a small fraction of point mutations will be beneficial (Sanju\u00e1 n, Moya, and Elena 2004; Carrasco, de la Iglesia, and Elena 2007) , e.g. in this case by lowering expression of the inserted gene or leading to more favorable codon usage. We therefore conjecture that mutation supply is likely to favor the evolution of deletions in the transgene over beneficial point mutations that affect fitness cost. Consider the 'genomic accordion' observed in poxviruses (Elde et al. 2012) : beneficial point mutations typically occur long after gene amplification by copy number variation. Likewise we expect deletions that remove an insertion to be fixed before point mutations that also lessen its impact occur. Nevertheless, the occurrence of alternative evolutionary trajectories could, depending on the exact mutation supply and effect sizes for different classes of mutations, contribute to making stability of genomic inserts less repeatable and predictable in some cases (De Visser and Krug 2014; Bolnick et al. 2018 ).",

In the case of ssDNA (group II) viruses, the varying frequency of genomic segments might lead to rapid adaptive responses to inserted sequences.

            "text": "Given these complexities, we think it may be challenging to develop predictive models of insert stability, for different types of virus genomes under different conditions. We hope to see developments in this area, possibly linked to resurging interest in preventing and exploiting DI viruses. However, we think that experimental tests of the stability of viral constructs will remain important in the foreseeable future. Experimental evolution can detect design problems in engineered genomes by looking at fitness and evolutionary stability (Springman et al.) . As Springman and collaborators suggest, experimental evolution may also prove useful for optimizing the stability of expression vectors by ameliorating constraints for which solutions are hard to predict because we lack a mechanistic understanding, such as codon usage (Carrasco, de la Iglesia, and Elena 2007; Agashe et al. 2013) . This approach can lead to improved engineering of viral genomes, which is also of interest for designing vectors with tags to follow viral infection, and for the use of viral vectors for gene therapy as well as for vaccine vectors. Finally, for real-world applications it can be useful to determine quantitatively the impact of the loss of inserted sequences on the desired output. For example, models suggest that deletions in vector vaccines may not have a large impact on eliciting the desired immune response (Bull, Nuismer, and Antia 2019) .",

We cannot stress enough the importance of replication in studying genomic stability, in the first place because mutation is a stochastic process. Moreover, as illustrated by our simple simulations-in which mutation is deterministic-bottlenecks and population dynamics can also introduce further stochastic effects that influence stability (Fig. 1) . Furthermore, empirical studies with high levels of replication show the extent to which observed stability does vary between replicates (Zwart et al. 2014 ).",

For all three panels, viral generations are on the x-axis, the log frequency of the deletion variant which has lost the insert is on the y-axis, and replicate populations are plotted in different randomly chosen shades of blue along the z-axis. We illustrate the bottleneck (i.e. the moment of passaging) with red dotted lines. When the population bottlenecks are narrow (panel A), the frequency of deletion variants is 'reset' during passaging as they are too scarce to be sampled. As the bottleneck is widened (panels B and C), occasionally the deletion variant is sampled.",

The upper sequence of events illustrates serial passage with narrow bottlenecks (N \u00bc 2), whereas the lower sequence illustrates passage with a broader bottleneck (N \u00bc 4). When bottlenecks are narrow, viral genomes with deletions are less likely to pass through the bottleneck and the population can be 'reset' at the start of every passage. When the bottleneck is broader, viral genomes with deletions are sampled despite the bottleneck and the deletion quickly goes to a high frequency. A more detailed treatment of this issue and a simulation model is presented in Box 1 and Fig. 2.",
