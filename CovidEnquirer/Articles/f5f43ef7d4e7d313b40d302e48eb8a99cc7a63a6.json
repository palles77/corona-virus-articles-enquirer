The larger of the suborders is Sciurognathi, which includes five families of squirrel-like rodents (including the squirrel family, Sciuridae) and five families of mouse-like rodents. The largest mouse-like rodent family is the Muridae, which includes the pet species of rats, mice, gerbils and hamsters. The Hystricognathi suborder has 16 families, with families seen as pets including the Caviidae (cavies), Chinchillidae (which includes the chinchilla), and Octodontidae (octodonts, such as the degu).",

For most species, injection into the caudal right quadrant of the abdomen should avoid viscera (Bihun and Bauck, 2004) .

Impromptu masks can be made from syringe cases attached to the end of the anaesthetic circuit. A significant problem when using masks on rodents is the risk of anaesthetic gas escape from loose-fitting masks into the environment, with attendant risks to staff. Active scavenge is available with some circuits (see Fig. 2 .2, Fluovac\u00ae, International Market Supply Ltd., Harvard Bioscience Inc., Congleton, UK).

In some cases, a staged procedure is used, whereby the use of volatile agents or a short-acting combination allows an initial assessment and perhaps minor dental treatment. After a few days of nutritional support, when the chinchilla is in better body condition, a more prolonged procedure can be performed under a longer anaesthetic.
