The effects of integrative TCM/WM treatment have not been fully quantified. Objectives: To systematically asses the treatment effects of integrated TCM with WM versus WM alone in patients with SARS, incorporating data from recently published studies. Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted, using published randomized and nonrandomized controlled clinical studies that compared the treatment effects of integrative TCM/WM with WM alone from 2002 to 2006.The outcome measurements included mortality rate, cure rate, resolution of pulmonary infiltrate, use of corticosteroid, and time to defervescence. The effect sizes were presented as risk ratio (RR), rate difference (RD), and weighted mean difference (WMD).The pooled effect sizes were calculated by both fixed-effects and random-effects models. Results: A total of 1,678 patients with a diagnosis of SARS were identified, including 866 patients from 16 randomized controlled studies and 812 patients from 8 nonrandomized controlled studies. There were no differences detected in mortality rate or cure rate between treatments. Compared with patients receiving WM treatment alone, patients receiving integrative treatment were more likely to have complete or partial resolution of pulmonary infiltrate (RD=0.18, 95%CI; 0.07 to 0.30), lower average daily dosage (mg) of corticosteroid (WMD=-60.27, 95% CI; -70.58 to -49.96), higher CD4+ counts (cells/uL) (WMD=167.96, 95% CI; 109.68 to 226.24), and shorter time to defervescence (days) (WMD= -1.06, 95%CI;-1.60 to -0.53). Conclusions: The experience of integrative TCM/WM in the treatment of SARS is encouraging. The use of TCM as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of SARS should be further investigated. S.

Los efectos del tratamiento MTC/TO no han sido completamente cuantificados. Objetivos: Evaluar sistem\u00e1ticamente los efectos del tratamiento integrado de MTC con TO contra el TO solo en pacientes con SRAG, incorporando datos de estudios recientemente publicados. M\u00e9todos: se realiz\u00f3 un meta-an\u00e1lisis utilizando los estudios cl\u00ednicos controlados aleatorizados y no aleatorizados que comparaban la eficacia del tratamiento integrado MTC/TO con el TO solo desde 2002 a 2006. Las medidas de resultados inclu\u00edan tasa de mortalidad, tasa de cura, resoluci\u00f3n de infiltrados pulmonares, uso de corticoides, y tiempo a la recuperaci\u00f3n. Los efectos fueron presentados como riesgo relativo (RR), tasa de diferencia (TD) y diferencia media ponderada (DMP). Los efectos combinados se calcularon tanto por efectos fijos como por modelos de efecto aleatorio. Resultados: Se identificaron un total de 1678 pacientes con diagn\u00f3stico de SARS, incluyendo 866 pacientes de 16 estudios controlados aleatorizados y 812 pacientes de 8 estudios controlados no aleatorizados. No hubo diferencias detectadas en las tasad e mortalidad o tasa de cura entre los tratamientos. Comparados con los pacientes recibiendo TO solo, los pacientes que recibieron tratamiento integrado ten\u00edan m\u00e1s probabilidad de tener una resoluci\u00f3n total o parcial del infiltrado pulmonar (TD=0. 18 With these considerations in mind, we conducted a meta-analysis using updated literature searches to asses the treatment effects of integrated TCM with WM in patients with SARS and to determine whether integrative treatment was more efficacious than WM alone in reducing mortality rate, increasing cure rate, and improving other clinical outcomes.

First, due to the limited number of published RCT studies, our analysis also included some NRC studies. However, the sudden outbreak of this new and serious disease precluded well controlled clinical studies during the epidemic. Despite twenty-four clinical studies, most of them had low methodological quality according to the Jadad scores. Second, the variation in treatment regimens, particularly the wide range of TCM in concoction constituents, dose, route of administration, and duration of therapy, became a major obstacle to a clear interpretation of the results. Third, there were only three studies that reported the outcomes on the basis of severity of disease. The data were insufficient for conducting an effective subset analysis on the severity of disease. Fourth, diagnoses of SARS during the outbreak were not confirmed by laboratory evidence of the SARS-Cov infection. As a recent study indicated, out of 28 patients, only 24 (85.71%) were eventually confirmed as having SARS according to the T-PCT detection of SARS-Cov RNA. 41 Fifth, because of the variety of TCM and WM under study, it would have been difficult to meaningfully measure the rate of adverse events related to treatments. Therefore, such an analysis of adverse events was not conducted as part of this present study.",

This study demonstrated the possibility that integrated TCM/WM treatments might be a beneficial modality for the treatment of SARS, especially on quickening the resolution of lung infiltrate, increasing the CD4+ counts, and reducing the time to defervescence. Clearly, further studies are needed with any future outbreak of SARS, and the quality of studies evaluating TCM needs to be improved. Further studies should aim to standardize the TCM treatment and include long-term follow-up on major outcomes in order to strengthen the rationale of using TCM.",
