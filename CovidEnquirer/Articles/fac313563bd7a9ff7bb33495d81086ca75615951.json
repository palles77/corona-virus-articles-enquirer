            "text": "Correspondence to Dr Michael Wilkes; mswilkes@ucdavis.edu ABSTRACT It is increasingly clear that resolution of complex global health problems requires interdisciplinary, intersectoral expertise and cooperation from governmental, nongovernmental and educational agencies. 'One Health' refers to the collaboration of multiple disciplines and sectors working locally, nationally and globally to attain optimal health for people, animals and the environment. One Health offers the opportunity to acknowledge shared interests, set common goals, and drive toward team work to benefit the overall health of a nation. As in most countries, the health of Rwanda's people and economy are highly dependent on the health of the environment. Recently, Rwanda has developed a One Health strategic plan to meet its human, animal and environmental health challenges. This approach drives innovations that are important to solve both acute and chronic health problems and offers synergy across systems, resulting in improved communication, evidence-based solutions, development of a new generation of systems-thinkers, improved surveillance, decreased lag time in response, and improved health and economic savings. Several factors have enabled the One Health movement in Rwanda including an elaborate network of community health workers, existing rapid response teams, international academic partnerships willing to look more broadly than at a single disease or population, and relative equity between female and male health professionals. Barriers to implementing this strategy include competition over budget, poor communication, and the need for improved technology. Given the interconnectedness of our global community, it may be time for countries and their neighbours to follow Rwanda's lead and consider incorporating One Health principles into their national strategic health plans.",

As we have recently seen with the Ebola and Zika outbreaks, in our interconnected world, an animal pathogen can catch a ride on the sole of a shoe, beneath a finger nail, or in respiratory passages, and travel from one remote corner of the globe to another in less than a day. Furthermore, zoonotic illness is not a small or insignificant problem; the majority of human pathogens are zoonotic (60%) and three-quarters of new and emerging pathogens are zoonotic from wildlife species. 4 5 However, One Health, which is larger than simply zoonosis (other examples include land use, water toxins, forest degradation and climate change (see online supplementary appendix A)), can have a great impact on people and the quality of their lives as well as local and national economies.",

Waste dumped in or near water flows through streams, rivers and lakes, affecting entire communities-crops, animals and people. Meanwhile, as the human population on the planet increases, humans are forced to live in closer proximity to both wild and domestic animals, which increases exposure to new pathogens, and forces the sharing of limited supplies of water (see online supplementary appendix B). Add to this the growing pressures to increase agricultural production, global warming with the resultant decrease in water supplies, changing microbial patterns, and deforestation, and the result is a deterioration of natural resources and a reduction in many of the protections and checks and balances that have previously been afforded to human populations.",

Non-government organisations (NGOs) that align themselves with one issue or disease are often disconnected from interventions for others. It is this sort of Brownian approach to improving health that results in poor communication between disciplines, duplication of services with resulting higher costs, ignoring of common antecedent causes of poor health, and inefficient utilisation of available resources such as specialised reference laboratory facilities. Academic communities, local and national governments, and scientists worldwide are now recognising that the next logical step in problem solving is to connect interdisciplinary and government agency experts so that they can focus on the root causes of illness and the need for prevention and detection rather than responding separately and acutely to each disease. The activities and conditions of each individual, each region, and each country affect others on a variety of levels including economic, cultural, physical, social and more. While very few sub-Saharan African countries are taking steps to put these ideas into action, Rwanda is unique in that it is well on its way.",

The nation confronts various challenges: energy sustainability, natural gas extraction from beneath Lake Kivu, a growing population, land degradation, crop raiding, wildlife poaching 6 ; a loss of biodiversity, conversion of forests to farm land and the risk of soil overexploitation; and climate change resulting in an increasingly variable rainfall. In addition, Rwanda is one of the most densely populated (415 people/square mile) countries in the world, 7 where One Health disasters can quickly affect large populations. Further, areas with high population density are more prone to food insecurity, soil erosion, decreased grazing lands, and forest degradation, which in turn leads to increased food insecurity and other measures of poor health. 8 9 The eastern part of Rwanda is home to pastoral communities, which move from place to place in search of water and pastures to feed their animals. Movement is not limited to the national borders, thus pastoralists are at risk of picking up animal pathogens that can be disastrous to the livestock population in Rwanda such as foot and mouth disease and contagious bovine pleural pneumonia, both of which have become endemic. 10 11 These diseases have high mortality and thus affect food security and the economic well-being of these nomads. Contagion between animals (wild and domestic) and humans does not happen in only one direction. In 2011, one of the mountain gorillas, which provide large eco-tourism revenue for Rwanda, succumbed to a human virus (human meta-pneumovirus) passed on by a tourist. 12 Through these experiences, Rwanda has learned that the eradication of hunger through initiatives such as Girinka (one cow per family (see online supplementary appendix B)), improvements in public health indicators (eg, improved maternal health, reduction in HIV, reducing malaria and other vector borne illnesses), and environmental sustainability all depend on interdependent systems, shared responsibility, involvement of the community, and collaboration across government agencies, content specialists and policies-all ideas embodied by One Health, a burgeoning global approach to integrated health. The government of Rwanda has therefore framed policies and priorities to drive toward an integrated, holistic-system approach to promoting health. Moreover, it has led to the adoption of the One Health approach by the East African Community, and Rwanda is also working with its neighbours to address regional issues that recognise the inextricable connection between the health of the country's people, animals and environment and the importance of this interconnection in development. The concept and approach of One Health provides an opportunity for the Rwandan government to expand its reforms to address important interdisciplinary, intersectoral health problems and work to meet the Sustainable Development Goals. Rwanda has therefore set out to achieve, in policy and practice, what has yet to be implemented across any nation-an evidence-based, interconnected system to address One Health problems. 13 ",

This multipronged strategic plan is problem focused rather than discipline focused, and seeks to bring together the newly realigned University of Rwanda, the Ministries of Health, Agriculture and Animal Resources and Education, The Wildlife Unit of the Rwanda Development Board, and other ministries and civil society. The strategic plan reflects Rwanda's belief that complex health problems can be addressed through integrated policy and interventions that simultaneously and holistically address multiple causes of poor health (eg, poverty, limited education, unsafe and scarce water, lack of sanitation, food insecurity, gender inequality, and close proximity of humans and animals). 14 To further reinforce One Health principles and uphold accountability to the strategic plan, Rwanda has set out to meet three core One Health objectives over the next few years.",

Despite limited resources, Rwanda's One Health approach is intended to develop collaborative leaders committed to improving health equity and social justice by addressing health disparities that impact on efficiency by promoting shared resources and collaboration among those working at the animal (wildlife, livestock and companion animals), ecosystem and human health interface.",

For example, the Rwandan strategic plan requires the inclusion of veterinarians, wildlife experts and environmental experts who work on emergency management committees. Similarly, disease surveillance of both zoonotic and potential zoonotic disease is monitored by a multidisciplinary team. This is a bottom-to-top approach that involves community health workers (CHWs), community-based animal health workers, NGOs, health clinics, hospitals, park rangers, farmers and domestic animal owners. These experts are prepared and trained to act rapidly and collaboratively given evolving information.",

However, despite extensive capacity-building efforts in Rwanda, there remains an undersupply of physicians, veterinarians and environmental scientists. To combat this problem, several colleges and universities have recently coalesced into the University of Rwanda to improve opportunities for interprofessional training, interdisciplinary scholarship and research innovation, and work force expansion. Harmonisation of the environmental health programmes offered by the old veterinary college and the old 'human health sciences' college has now provided another great opportunity to articulate One Health as a cross-disciplinary approach.",

There has long been a need to develop infrastructure such interdisciplinary laboratories and structures that promote interdisciplinary, interministerial collaboration focused on problem solving (eg, childhood diarrhoea linked to bovine mastitis). In Rwanda, the key ministries related to One Health have already coalesced to form a ministerial 'Social Cluster' which meets monthly, with the goal of ensuring that there is little competition for resources between ministries and that shared issues are addressed collectively.
