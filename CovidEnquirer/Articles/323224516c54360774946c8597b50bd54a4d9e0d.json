            "text": "Recombinant viral vectors are useful tools for AIDS vaccine development. However, expression of HIV-1 envelope genes using viral vectors has not been successful in the induction of potent neutralizing antibodies in vivo. We took advantage of the strong immunogenicity of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based vector and expressed HIV-1 HXB2 gp120 gene in the recombinant VSV. Our results showed that HIV-1 gp120 protein expressed by the recombinant VSV retained the native conformation of the protein to some degree and was recognized by two well-characterized broad anti-HIV-1 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies b12, 2G12. We further showed that only one time intranasal immunization with the recombinant VSV led to production of anti-HIV-1 anti-sera in mice. In addition, we found that the antisera had the ability to neutralize not only HXB2 envelope-pseudotyped HIV-1 viruses but also HIV-1 pseudotyped viruses with JRFL envelopes. These results suggest that HIV-1 gp120 expressed by the recombinant VSV, in combination with the route of intranasal administration, is an effective strategy to evaluate the immunogenicity of HIV-1 envelope protein and its variants in mice.",

The structure of the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins, particularly those of primary isolates, has evolved to minimize the elic-itation and efficacy of neutralizing antibodies [8] [9] [10] . In principle, it is possible to genetically re-engineer the immunoevasive envelope protein and to convert it into the immunostimulatory vaccine antigen. Several reports have indicated that specific modifications introduced in the HIV-1 envelope may increase the immunogenicity and stimulate animals producing broadly neutralizing antibodies [11] [12] [13] [14] . The modifications include loop deletion [11, 12] , introduction of unique Pro-Met mutation into V3 tip of HIV-1 envelope [13] , and the removal of selected N-linked glycosylation sites [14] . Development of an optimally immunogenic envelope vaccine will require further more extensive modifications on HIV-1 envelope proteins and high-throughput screening of potential immunogens. The large amount required for HIV-1 envelope protein used in immunization or the length of time required for maturation of HIV-1 neutralization antibodies in DNA vaccination has constrained the development of high-throughput screening for immunogenicity of different HIV-1 envelope mutations. Therefore, methods that can induce more rapid and potent neutralizing antibodies are needed to test number of potential immunogens.",

Live recombinant viruses have been used to evaluate the effectiveness of HIV-1 envelope protein in inducing protective immunity against HIV-1 (reviewed in [18] ). Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a member of the Rhabdovirus family, is a non-segmented, negative-strand RNA virus. The development of a system to recover VSV from cDNA has allowed the manipulation of VSV genome and the expression of foreign genes in recombinant VSV. A number of genes from different viruses have been inserted into the recombinant VSV vector and recombinant VSVs have then been produced and used as immunogens to immunize animals and these have stimulated strong immune responses against a particular virus [19] [20] [21] . The recombinant VSV vector has also been used in HIV-1 vaccine development [22] . In particular, the recombinant VSVs expressing HIV-1 89.6 Env and Gag protein have been used to immunize macaques and have been shown to generate protective immunity against the SHIV 89.6P challenge [23] .",

Two complementary oligonucleotides containing the transcript stop/start sequences and a XhoI site were cloned into NheI site between G and L genes [26] . The resulting plasmid was designated as pVSV. The plasmids named pSK-N, pSK-P, and pSK-L were constructed by cloning N, P, and L genes into pSK-Ter at XhoI/XbaI sites [27] . The HIV-1 HXB2 gp120 gene was modified so that the signal peptide of TPA from pJW4304 (a gift from Prof. James Mullins at University of Washington School of Medicine) was used to substitute the signal peptide of HIV-1 HXB2 gp120 and the transmembrane region and cytoplasmic tail of VSV-glycoprotein (VSV-G) were added to the C terminus of HIV-1 HXB2 gp120. The fusion gene encoding HIV-1 HXB2 gp120 aa 32-505 was then cloned into pVSV plasmid using XhoI and NheI sites. The resulting plasmid was designated as pVSV-HXB2. Meanwhile, the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene from pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and luciferase gene were also cloned into pVSV, respectively (designated as pVSV-eGFP and pVSV-luc).",

In this study, we confirmed that foreign genes can be engineered into VSVs, and the recombinant VSV expressing HIV-1 envelope can induce neutralizing antibodies by a single intranasal inoculation. The immunization of mice with recombinant VSVs expressing various HIV-1 envelope or HIV-1 envelope mutations and detection of neutralizing ability to HIV-1 isolates in a standard assay panel [33] serve as an effective and rapid alternative approaches to determine better immunogens for eliciting neutralizing antibodies. This strategy could facilitate HIV-1 vaccine development.",

            "text": "One of the advantages of the rVSV vector is the high titer of recombinant VSVs [27] . In our experiments, the recombinant VSVs expressing HIV-1 gp120, luc, and eGFP recovered by passage on BHK-21 cells 3 times have been determined by plaque assay. The titers were 1.2 \u00b7 10 8 , 1.5 \u00b7 10 8 , and 2.7 \u00b7 10 8 pfu/ml, respectively, the titer being lower than those of recovered wild-type VSVs which were 4.5 \u00b7 10 8 pfu/ml, but they are within the same range. Another advantage of VSV-based vector is that recombinant VSVs can stimulate strong cellular and humoral immune responses [19, 20] . Recombinant VSVs expressing HIV-1 gag and envelope proteins can form virus like particles and induce high level CTL responses against HIV-1 gag and envelope [34, 35] . In our experiments, the intranasal inoculation with recombinant VSV expressing HIV-1 HXB2 gp120 only once can induce antibodies binding HIV-1 envelope protein expressed on the 293T cell surface. The anti-sera of mice could neutralize HIV-1 HXB2 and JRFL pseudotyped HIV-1 reporter viruses. The titer neutralizing HXB2 measured as IC 50 is about 1:120 and the titer neutralizing JRFL is about 1:30. All the sera specifically inhibit HIV-1 envelope pseudotyped viruses since they cannot inhibit SARS-CoV spike pseudotyped virus entry host cells. This neutralizing titer is at the same range as DNA immunization results of modified HIV-1 gp120 or gp140 by adding three copies of C 3 d as molecular adjust. The DNA immunization needs boost DNA twice after the first immunization or boosted with protein after two times DNA immunization, so it requires at least 4 months to develop neutralizing antibodies [36, 37] . After recombinant VSV immunization, there were detectable neutralizing antibodies at 4 weeks and peaked at 5 weeks. This short time of maturation of HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies makes this method very convenient for evaluating HIV-1 envelope protein\u00d5s immunogenicity. The recombinant VSVs express gp120 on the cell\u00d5s surface of infected BHK-21 cells. As shown in Fig. 2 , the gp120 expression can be identified by Western blot on the cell lyses and by FACS analysis with HIV-1 mAb b12, 2G12. These data confirmed that the modified gp120 on the cell surface kept the na\u00efve conformations which may be important for inducing HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies. Although we detected the expression of gp120 in the infected cells, but there were no detectable gp120 on the recombinant virions. We pelleted the viruses and compared the viral protein expression within the recombinant viruses. We found that all recombinant VSV virions expressed the L, N/P, and M protein at similar levels to those of wild VSVs on a Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE (data not show). However, we were not able to detect the presence of HIV-1 gp120 within the recombinant VSV virions. This result is consistent with previous data [34] that rVSVs expressing HIV-1 89.6 gp160 envelope at high level (30% of that of VSV G protein), but much lower gp160 (about 3% of VSV G protein level) was incorporated into recombinant VSV virions. The lower level of inoculation of HIV-1 envelope protein is quite different when compared with other foreign proteins expressed by rVSVs. As described previously, CD4 protein, measles virus hemagglutinin are both effectively incorporated into virions [27] . The lower incorporation may be due to the intracellular retention and degradation of HIV-1 envelope before it reaches the cell surface [34, 38] . To further enhance the immunogenicity of HIV-1 envelope protein expressed by rVSVs, new recombinant VSV vectors encoding costimulatory molecules and cytokines or by expressing HIV-1 envelope protein covalently linked to C 3 d will be developed and tested. With these improvements on VSV vector, the HIV-1 envelope antigen will be more effectively presented and easy to immunize. In addition, the neutralizing antibodies can be detected within a shorter time. The recombinant VSVs expressing HIV-1 envelope and envelope mutations will make a high-throughput comparison possible.",
