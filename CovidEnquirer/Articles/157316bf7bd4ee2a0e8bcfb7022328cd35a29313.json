This is not to detract from the value of tourism as an area of academic study in its own right, but the vocational element of tourism education necessitates that it is considered in the wider labour market context. It is not sufficient to examine tourism education without considering the progression of individuals that undertake tourism studies with a possible view to entering employment and developing their careers in the industry. Furthermore, given the amount of employment opportunities available in the various tourism sectors and the ability of tourism development to generate jobs, tourism education is often the starting point in the training and development of human capital to undertake these occupations. Therefore, tourism education is closely related to employment and careers in the industry from both an individual perspective in terms of their personal career development and opportunities, and an organisational perspective in terms of the supply of labour available for the industry.",

Labour markets can be defined in a number of ways including their size, skill level and the nature of skills, cost of labour, geographical location and mobility patterns. Any analysis of tourism labour markets is problematic, due to the sheer size and diversity of the tourism industry. The difficulties begin with trying to define tourism, followed by attempts to define tourism employment. Even when a sector is identified, there are considerable levels of organisational and job diversity (Riley. Ladkin. & Szivas, 2002) . Tourism labour markets are dynamic, with many sectors being characterised by occupational diversity, relatively low pay, a high percentage of young people in the occupations, high levels of mobility and low specificity of skills .",

Andriotis and Vaughan (2004) reviewed a number of characteristics of the tourism workforce. These are seasonal, part-time, female, expatriate/migrant, pluriactivity, and existing in the informal economy. Many jobs in tourism are seasonal, with hotels and facilities either scaling down activities or closing after the main season. Part-time jobs and a high percentage of female workers are also widespread across the tourism industry. and often surplus jobs are filled by a migrant or expatriate workforce. These in turn can have a downward effect on pay. Tourism may also create multiple employment, whereby someone may have a main job in a different sector during the day, but then be employed part time in a tourism job at night. Finally, the informal sector of tourism is characterised by such activities as beach vendors (Andriotis & Vaughan, 2004) . These job characteristics may give a negative perception of employment in tourism, which affects the dimension and qualities of tourism labour markets.",

The overriding problem with a definition of tourism employment is tied to the difficulties of defining tourism and the dynamics and complexity of the industry. Issues such as the overlap and strong linkages of sectors, the problems of categorising tourists, the mixing of tourists and locals using the same facilities, the informal economy and the lack of statistics that hamper the definition of tourism can be equally applied to the problems of defining tourism employment. Tourism is not recognised as a single entity in the Standard Industrial Classification, but exists in a number of different areas. For estimating tourism employment in the UK the Department of Culture, Media and Sport use the following S.1.C codes; 55 1/552 (hotels and other tourist accommodations), 553 (restaurants, cafes, etc.), 554 (bars, public houses and nightclubs), 663 (travel agencies and tour operators), 935 (libraries, museums and other cultural activities), and 926/927 (sport and other recreation).",

There are inherent problems in classifying jobs that go beyond the remit of the discussion here, but can be found in Riley et al. (2002) .

Ladkin and Riley (1996) examine mobility and structure in the career patterns of UK hotel managers, using a labour market hybrid of the bureaucratic model. There are two possible reasons why research into the careers of hotel managers is more advanced than for other occupations. The first is the importance of the hotel manager job as a profession in the industry, and the second is that as a target job it is easy to identify and monitor over time. The route to becoming a hotel manager often has clearly identified stages. Furthermore, evidence by and Ladkin and Riley ( I 996) demonstrates that hotel managers are committed to the industry and their movements in the internal and external labour markets can be easily identified. Further research in the tourism area would address the imbalance.",

            "text": "Career theory is a broad term, which refers to a set of exploratory and investigative approaches used to measure and analyse the phenomenon (Riley & Ladkin, 1994) . The study of careers draws from a wide range of disciplines including economics in the form of job search processes, organisational behaviour for the structure of jobs, personality psychology which links careers to jobs, and motivation theory in terms of job choices and motivations (Riley & Ladkin, 1994) . Although a career can be seen in a very simple form as a set of jobs that take place over time, this hides the complexity of a career that contains direction, time, pace, motivations, barriers, the development of human capital and goals. Furthermore, careers take place within the internal and external labour markets and are related to the cost and mobility of labour, all of which makes them a complex entity to understand. A comprehensive review and explanation of career theory has been given by Arthur, Hall, and Lawrence (1 989). This review sparked the beginnings of a debate as to whether or not careers are a separate and distinctive area of study, with accepted identifiable theoretical perspectives and methodologies. Clearly, career theory. as with careers in general, does not remain static over time (Swanson, 1992) . Emergent themes include the interaction of work and non-work, work and well-being, dual career issues and changing labour needs, and the changing nature of careers. Recently, Iellatcchitch, Mayrhofer, and Meyer (2003) argue for examining careers in terms of career fields as a means towards understanding overall career theory. Managing careers from both a theoretical and practical approach is further explored by both Swanson (1999) and Yehuda (2003) .",

The potential for job creation identifies tourism as a positive agent for change, resulting in governments using tourism as a development and regeneration strategy (Andriotis & Vaughan, 2004) . Furthermore, in areas where other sectors of employment have declined, for example, in agriculture or heavy industry, tourism often becomes the main source of employment. As has previously been identified, the quality of these jobs is questionable, with a lack of higher level jobs resulting in a lack of career development. However, one feature of tourism employment is that while some jobs are directly related to travel and tourism and may suffer from the above characteristics, other jobs are produced as a result of the indirect effects of tourism. These jobs often do not suffer from the same characteristics (Cooper et al., 1998) .

With the move towards more liberalised employment opportunities particularly within the European Union, and with many global organisations such as hotels and airlines hiring from a global labour market, there are career and employment opportunities available in tourism that cross international boundaries. One of the problems with this movement of labour on an international scale is the recognition of tourism qualifications. Tourism qualifications that can be recognised internationally is an issue currently being addressed by the Education Council of the WTO. One certainty is the importance of language abilities for employees in tourism, and the ability to speak at least three major languages is often a requirement for employment in global tourism corporations.",

Without significant improvements, the ILO predicts that 5 million jobs, representing 6% of the industry's total employment will be lost. The effects would not be the same in all regions, but countries experiencing the direct effects of the above would be the most seriously affected. The ILO also identify additional factors that could further affect job losses. These are that reductions in labour made in the short term tend to become permanent, as existing staff cope with the demand using new working methods and flexibility, and the modernisation of working methods. In Germany, TUI the world leader in tour operating, recently announced a US$280 million cost-cutting programme for 2004, with the possible loss of 2000 jobs (Belau, 2003) .

The fact that the number of tourism courses and the number of tourism graduates searching for jobs in the industry is increasing is without doubt (Airey & Johnson, 1999; Kusluvan & Kusluvan, 2000; Petrova & Mason, 2004) . The oversupply of tourism graduates is further compounded by the industry, which too often does not rate or recognise tourism education. Evidence provided by Hjalager and Andersen (200 1) and Ladkin and Riley (1 996) indicates that employees with a dedicated vocational tourism training do not necessarily have more rapid career progression than those with less relevant qualifications. Furthermore, industry has criticised tourism education for not adequately preparing people for employment in the industry (Airey, 1998; Petrova & Mason, 2004) , and employers are confused about what educational courses are on offer due to the rapid expansion (Evans, 1993) . On a more positive note however, there is evidence that employers are keen to work with tourism educators in order to improve the situation (Peacock & Ladkin, 2002) . A recent UK government paper on The firtiwe of higheredirccition (Department for Education and Skills, 2003) indicates the wish to build stronger partnerships between higher education institutions and the Regional Development Agencies (Tribe, 2003) .

(2003) as glamour, the opportunity to travel, meeting people, foreign language use and task variety. However, Thomas and Townsend (2001) identify that tourism jobs often compare unfavourably with jobs in other sectors in terms of employment relations, seasonality, and part time characteristics. Low pay, long hours, low skills, and minimal training can be added to this list (Szivas et al., 2003) . This reliance on untrained labour leads to poor quality of service, but the benefit for the industry is cheap and plentiful labour supply (Cooper et a]., 1998). One of the consequences of a poor perception of jobs in tourism is the loss of tourism professionals to other sectors (Hjalager, 2003) . The attitudes and motivations for choosing a career in tourism and the aspirations of those entering the industry is a research area that has received increasing amounts of attention (Petrova & Mason, 2004; Hjalager. 2003; Ross, 1997a, b; Airey & Frontistis, 1997) , which adds to an understanding of what drives people to work in the tourism industry.",

The popularity of tourism courses is undisputed. and those involved in the provision of tourism education have come a long way to raise the profile of the topic as an area of study, and to prove it is credible as an educational qualification. Of less certainty is what happens to individuals who enter the tourism workforce, and how their skills are used and valued by the tourism industry. While there are enormous opportunities for employment in tourism, a lack of career development and the unattractiveness of some occupations remain a problem for those who choose tourism as a career route.",
