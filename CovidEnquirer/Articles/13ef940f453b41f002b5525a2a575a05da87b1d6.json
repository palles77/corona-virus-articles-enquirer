It has been more than 25 years since Legionnaire's disease created widespread panic among the public.",

There are escalating fears and doubts among our colleagues about caring for the sick and injured. One month before the outbreak in China, Western visitors to Beijing hospitals did not see evidence of universal precautions that are adhered to in the United States and Canada. Visitors noted that health care providers did not wear gloves or wash their hands with soap after patient contact. Needles were soaked in a disinfectant solution before being reused. Unfortunately, the Chinese government currently forbids health care workers in China to discuss SARS cases, so efforts by outside individuals and groups who want to help colleagues in and around Hong Kong are hindered.",

Within hours after the patient was admitted, 28% of the emergency department (ED) nursing staff, 40% of the coronary care unit staff, and another 28% of the intensive care unit nursing staff were diagnosed as probable SARS patients. Hospitals in the area were locked down, isolating staff and patients from their families. Nurses were among those who were quarantined for 10 days, whereas others worked 3 weeks straight without a day off. One nursing colleague from Mount Sinai Hospital was labeled as a public enemy by the media (after riding public transit with what she thought was a head cold). 1 Restaurants posted window signs welcoming all except hospital workers (they were banned). Some nurses required the administration of blood products as a result of hemolytic anemia caused by ribavirin, the antiviral medication used to treat the disease. When 1 ED nurse finally was cleared to leave, his car had been rammed and disabled in the hospital parking lot, and the city's taxi drivers refused to transport him home.",

She has expressed concern of being a scapegoat for public health officials through the media because \"her actions\" may indicate that some of the isolation procedures implemented by the Ontario Ministry of Health did not effectively prevent the spread of the disease. In debriefing sessions since the outbreak, many hospital workers have reported feeling guilty and unable to face crowds, and several already have indicated that they \"aren't coming back.\" One nurse manager referred to the experience as \"4 weeks of hell.\"",

She believes that no hospital has the negative airflow capacity to accommodate ill patients during a potential epidemic. She has had to re-evaluate entry routes to her isolation room and believes that isolation units (not single rooms) may be the wave of the future. Triage areas may need to be redesigned to provide glass partitions that distance sick patients from nursing personnel and others during the registration process. Traffic flow into the ED must be re-evaluated so that infected patients can be isolated immediately. She noted that 1 sanatorium in the area that was closed in the early 1980s was reopened last month because of the volume of SARS victims. An interesting phenomenon was realized as a potential source of cross-contamination-nurses who work several part-time positions in 2 or more hospitals. Some were hard to identify and track, making the situation more difficult to isolate and contain. SARS has had a direct impact on educational programs, including scheduled trauma nurse core courses, because hospital personnel including instructors currently are not permitted to travel into other facilities.",

Frontline health care workers are the nation's first line of defense in the identification and treatment of disease.
