Preliminary studies have suggested that 2019-nCoV is much more infectious but less deadly [4, 5] than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). 2019-nCoV is capable of human-to-human transmission even during its asymptomatic incubation period (3-7 days [6] ). On 23 rd January, the Chinese government initiated an unprecedented public health measure to confine the epidemic by locking down 13 cities in Hubei province, preventing movement of its population by terminating most forms of transportation [7, 8] . We Overall, the lockdown may partially halt the spread of the epidemic in Hubei province. In the status quo, as the lockdown remains effective when this article is written, we assume the lockdown will last for three weeks based on the official schedule of the working day. The lockdown has effectively shut down most forms of transportation, both public and private, we estimate the number of person-to-person contacts per day among its residents has reduced from thirteen to ten. The percentage of facial mask usage in public space has also drastically increased to almost 100% in Hubei province during the lockdown. However, the increase may be due to people's perception of the severity of the epidemic, rather than the lockdown itself. After the lockdown period of 21 days, we assumed the person-to-person contact rate will return to normal but mask usage will retain. With these assumptions, we forecast that the number of confirmed 2019-nCoV cases will reach its peak of 12,143 (5, 852) individuals at 27 (23-36) days (i.e., 17 Feb [14-27 Feb]) after the lockdown initiation ( Figure   1c ). The trend will then gradually decline and the cumulative number of infections and death cases in Hubei province will reach 128,960 (39,362-218,560) and 4,381 (1,667-7,095) at the end of the epidemic (Figure 1a ), corresponding to a fatality rate of 3.44% is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

In the case where no lockdown was in place, the epidemic will peak at 36,544 (13,919-61,243) confirmed cases and the total infections and death cases will reach 348,750 (84,140-613,360) and 11,076 (3,408-18,744), respectively. This suggests that the current lockdown strategy may eventually prevent 219,790 (44,773-394,800) 2019-nCoV infections and 6,695 (1,741-11,650) deaths, that is, 62.53% (59.98-65.08%) of infections and 59.91% (56.87-62.95%) deaths, compared with no lockdown. We observed a small re-bounce in the number of latent individuals when the 21-day lockdown is lifted ( Figure 1b) . However, this re-bounce does not fully account for the return influx of the 'travel rush' and cannot determine if a second epidemic will follow.",
