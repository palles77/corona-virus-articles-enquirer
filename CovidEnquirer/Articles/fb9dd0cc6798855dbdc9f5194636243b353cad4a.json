Theory predicts the immune systems of animals specialized for scavenging should have been molded by selective pressures associated with surviving microbial assaults from their food. Spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) are capable hunters that have recently descended from carrion feeding ancestors. Hyenas have been documented to survive anthrax and rabies infections, and outbreaks of several other viral diseases that decimated populations of sympatric carnivores. In light of the extreme disease resistance manifested by spotted hyenas, our objective was to identify tools available for studying immune function in spotted hyenas and use these tools to document the hyena antibody response to immunization. Domestic cats (Felis catus) are the closest phylogenetic relatives of hyenas that have been studied in detail immunologically, and we hypothesized that anti-cat isotype-specific antibodies would cross react with hyena immunoglobulin epitopes. We used ELISA and Western blots to test isotype-specific anti-feline antibodies for specific cross-reaction to hyena Ig epitopes. Molecular weights of heavy (IgA, IgG, IgM) and light chains of hyena immunoglobulins were determined by protein electrophoresis, and as expected, they were found to be similar to feline immunoglobulins. In order to further validate the cross-reactivity of the anti-feline antibodies and document the hyena humoral response, eight spotted hyenas were immunized with dinitrophenol conjugated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (DNP-KLH) and serum anti-DNP responses were monitored by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for one year. The full array of isotype-specific antibodies identified here will allow veterinarians and other researchers to thoroughly investigate the hyena antibody response, and can be used in future studies to test hypotheses about pathogen exposure and immune function in this species.",

These antibodies can potentially be used for broad, cost effective monitoring of pathogen infections in spotted hyenas, and to establish baseline parameters of health and disease among wild members of this species throughout sub-Saharan Africa and among captive hyenas at zoos and research facilities.

Most studies of pathogens infecting hyenas have relied on serum neutralization tests, agglutination assays, RT-PCR, or competitive ELISAs that do not require species-specific antibodies Cronwright-Snoeren, 2010; East et al., 2001; Harrison et al., 2004) . Each of these existing techniques is limited in its usefulness by various factors, and use of the newly discovered antibodies described here would avoid many of these limitations. Serum neutralization tests rely on cell culture, which can be labor-and resourceintensive (Wellehan et al., 2009) . Positive RT-PCR results for pathogens provide clear evidence of infection, but offer little information about duration of the infection or the nature of the immune response. Additionally, RT-PCR can only detect active infections. Agglutination tests are rapid and cost-effective, but are most sensitive to pentameric IgM and less sensitive to other isotypes (Cohen et al., 1967) . Competitive ELISAs and serum neutralization tests requiring no species-specific antibodies are limited because they permit no analysis of specific immunoglobulin isotypes. Rapid diagnosis using ELISA techniques can aid wildlife managers and veterinarians by permitting them to quickly diagnose disease outbreaks, and allowing them to develop better-informed responses to such outbreaks.",

Testing for both IgG and IgM has been used previously to stage infections; this method was used to assess whether infections are in earlier or later stages for tularemia (Carlsson et al., 1979) , dengue (Innis et al., 1989) , Rift Valley Fever (Pepin et al., 2010) , myxomatosis in rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculs) (Kerr, 1997) , and West Nile virus in equids (Durand et al., 2002) .

The temporal dynamics apparent in the changing Ig ratios (Fig. 3 ) in our hyena subjects might be carefully exploited to stage infections. However, we emphasize that samples positive for IgM, but negative for IgG, must be interpreted cautiously, as this might indicate either an early stage infection or simply the presence of natural antibodies (Ochsenbein and Zinkernagel, 2000) . The results of our experimental immunizations of captive hyenas show that all individuals had readily detectable anti-DNP IgM in pre-immune sera. Pre-infection sera are seldom available in serological studies of wildlife, so natural IgM might be misinterpreted as an active infection based solely on agglutination tests. Thus, ELISA or Western blots for IgG, IgA, and/or IgE in addition to assays for IgM are more effective for serological studies than agglutination tests alone.",

Hyenas cubs are weaned roughly 14 months after birth, a lactation interval far longer than that of most other carnivores (Hofer and East, 1995; ). Within 2-5 weeks of birth, spotted hyena cubs are transferred from an isolated natal den to a communal den where they live with up to 20 other cubs, and frequently engage in playful and aggressive interactions (Holekamp and Smale, 1998; Kruuk, 1972; Tanner et al., 2007) . The frequent social interactions at communal dens create a situation that can lead to high rates of transmission of infectious pathogens (Altizer et al., 2003) . Maternal IgG and IgA transferred from mother to offspring in milk could provide critical protection from pathogens during early life stages (Bourne and Curtis, 1973; Brambell, 1966; Claus et al., 2006; Mason et al., 1930) .",

Rabies virus has been detected in saliva of spotted hyenas expressing no clinical signs of disease (East et al., 2001) ; salivary IgA might play an important role in both intra-and interspecific transmission of rabies by neutralizing the virus in saliva before the virus has a chance to infect new individuals. Furthermore, fecal samples are the most readily available and least invasive samples available in most studies of free-living carnivores, and these typically contain large quantities of IgA. Analysis of fecal IgA can thus potentially provide a glimpse into the gut and mucosal immune systems of wild hyenas.",

IgE is the primary isotype involved in defense against parasitic worms. Our study has identified two cross-reacting mAb against hyena IgE in ELISAs (Table 1 ) that might be used to assess effects of parasites on Ig concentrations and ratios. However, the specific binding of the anti-IgE mAbs could not be confirmed here by Western blot, possibly due to the low concentration and short half-life of IgE in serum. IgE and IgG 1 are associated with Th2 response (Mosmann and Coffman, 1989; Mosmann and Sad, 1996; Romagnani, 1997) , a topic that is ripe for a comparative study. For example, it would be interesting to compare Th1 and Th2 markers in captive hyenas living in relatively clean environments with wild hyenas that face a continual assault from food-borne and socially transmitted pathogens.",
