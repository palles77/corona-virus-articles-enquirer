            "text": "Canine kobuviruses (CaKVs) are newly recognized picornaviruses that have been recently detected in dogs in the U.S.A., Italy, U.K., the Republic of Korea and Tanzania. To trace the evolution of CaKV strains, a total of 201 fecal samples from rectal swabs of diarrheic dogs, which were obtained from May 2014 to April 2015 in northeast China, were detected by reverse transcription-PCR targeting a partial (504 bp) fragment of the 3D gene. Furthermore, a phylogenetic analysis of the CaKV strains identified in northeast China was conducted based on the partial 3D gene sequence. The results indicated that 36 fecal samples (17.91%, 36/201) were positive for CaKV, in which the co-infection rates of canine coronavirus, canine parvovirus-2 and canine bocavirus were 58.33%, 41.67%, and 11.11%, respectively. Sequence comparison of the partial 3D gene revealed nucleotide homologies of 94.4-100%, 95.6-98.6%, 94.3-97.6%, 94.4-96.3% and 93.3-95.1% within the 36 Chinese CaKV strains, and between the 36 Chinese CaKV strains and four CaKV reference strains from South Korea, Italy, U.S.A. and Tanzania, respectively. A phylogenetic tree revealed that the 36 Chinese CaKV strains formed one specific CaKV lineage with CaKVs that have recently been identified in other countries. The 36 Chinese CaKV strains were closely related to CaKV reference strains from Asia and Europe, but differed genetically from CaKV reference strains from North America and Africa. This study provides evidence that CaKVs circulate in diarrhoetic dogs in China and that they exhibit substantial genetic diversity and high co-infection rates with other enteric viruses.",

Kobuvirus is a newly recognized genus in the family Picornaviridae. Several studies have demonstrated that kobuviruses are transmitted through the fecal-oral route via the consumption of contaminated food or water, and they have a potential role in gastroenteritis in humans and animals [2, 8, 11] . Canine kobuviruses (CaKVs) have been recently discovered in dogs [10] , demonstrating that pets can be infected with members of this genus. At present, epidemiological investigations of CaKVs in dogs are important for understanding their pathogenicity and given the interactions between pets and humans, their zoonotic potential.",

To construct the phylogenetic trees, a multiple alignment of all target sequences was performed using ClustalX program version 1.83 [18] . Furthermore, phylogenetic trees of all target sequences were generated from the ClustalX-generated alignments by MEGA6.06 software using the neighbor-join- ing method [17] . Neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees were built with the p-distance model, 1,000 bootstrap replicates and, otherwise, the default parameters in MEGA 6. Screening for canine enteric pathogens: All fecal samples that tested positive for CaKV were also screened for canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2), canine coronavirus (CCoV), canine astrovirus (CaAstV), canine norovirus (CNoV), canine bocavirus (CBoV) and Group A-Rotavirus (RV-A) by either PCR or RT-PCR, followed by sequencing, according to previously described protocols [3, 5, 6, 9, 12, 14] .",

In the current study, we conducted prevalence and phylogenetic analyses of canine kobuviruses in diarrhoetic dogs in northeast China. In our study, 36 of 201 (17.91%) fecal samples from diarrhoetic dogs were positive for CaKV, and the CaKV-positive rates in Harbin, Daqing and Mudanjiang were 19.86% (28/141), 20% (4/20) and 10% (4/40), respectively. In a previous study, a low prevalence of CaKV was reported by RT-PCR in the U.S.A. and Italy. Li et al. [13] reported that [15] reported that 19.04% (4/21) of diarrhoetic dogs tested positive for CaKV, while Choi et al. [5] reported that 50.55% (46/91) of diarrhoetic dogs tested positive for CaKV. The 17.91% CaKV-positive rate in our study is in agreement with that described by Oem et al. [15] . These data suggest that the prevalence of CaKVs may differ among different countries or regions.",

In our study, the CaKV-positive fecal samples were also screened for the leading causes of canine viral enteritis, including CPV-2, CCoV, CaAstV, CNoV, CaKV and RV-A. Co-infections with CPV-2, CCoV and CBoV were tion rates with CPV-2 and CCoV were 24.81% (34/137) and 22.62% (31/137), respectively [7] . In our study, CaKV was the only enteric virus identified in eight specimens, accounting for 22.22% (8/36) of all CaKV-positive samples. This result implies that CaKV alone may cause infections in the general population. However, the high co-infection rate of CaKV with other enteric viruses should be considered to be a composite factor for the occurrence of viral diarrhea in dogs in northeast China.",

Genetic analysis of the partial 3D region showed that the CaKVs identified in the Republic of Korea were more variable, sharing nucleotide sequence identities ranging from 85.1% to 99.8% [15] . The 36 CaKV-positive strains identified in China shared nucleotide sequence identities ranging from 94.4% to 100% and, thus, exhibited limited genetic diversity. The phylogenetic tree derived from the partial 3D gene from human and various animal species showed that CaKVs clustered into a single lineage. This finding supports the view that CaKVs from different countries are not restricted geographically and form a single lineage when compared with kobuviruses from other species. However, the lineage of the CaKV strains formed three groups-GI, GII and GIII-and the 36 Chinese CaKV strains were divided into the GI and GII groups. The 35 Chinese CaKV strains in the GI group were divided into the GIa, GIb and GIc subgroups. All 36 Chinese CaKV strains were closely related to the CaKV reference strains from Asia and Europe, and they differed genetically from the CaKV reference strains from North America and Africa. Thus, our data suggest that the lineages of CaKV strains may exhibit geographically differences. This conclusion needs to be validated by extensive epidemiological surveying in future studies.",
