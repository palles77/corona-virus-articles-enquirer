            "text": "The puppy, born without immunoglobulins G (IgG), acquires a passive systemic immunity thanks to colostrum intake during the two first days of life. The quality of passive immune transfer (i.e. blood IgG concentration at two days of age), highly variable between litters and between puppies within litters, depends mainly on the time elapsed between birth and ingestion of colostrum, with limited influence of colostrum IgG concentration. Deficit in passive immune transfer, impacting puppy's health and neonatal mortality rate, can be indirectly diagnosed through blood gammaglutamyltransferases assay and evaluation of growth rate over the two first days of life. In the absence of maternal colostrum, few homo-and heterospecific immune sources are available and canine colostrum banking remains the optimal solution. Whereas passive immune transfer is crucial for survival during the neonatal period, it later interferes with response to vaccination. In addition to systemic passive immune transfer, maternal antibodies (mainly IgA) would provide local (digestive) immunity, ensuring mid-term protection of the puppies' gut together with probably long term training of the digestive immune system.",

            "text": "Neonatal period in the canine species, defined as the first three weeks of life, is a critical period with high risk of mortality: about 10% of all live-born puppies die between birth and 21 days of age (Mugnier et al., 2018) . Survival rate during this period depends on the ability of the newborn to adapt to the extra-uterine life. Once cardiorespiratory system has been able to switch from a placental to an aerial oxygen provision, the newborn dog goes through new challenges, both immune and nutritional. From the nutritional point of view, the circulation of nutrients via placenta is interrupted at birth; nutrients supply relies on implementation of new strategies by the newborn, including mammary gland approach, suckling and milk digestion. The immune situation of the newborn dog is critical, as the endotheliochorial structure of the placenta drastically limits transplacental transfer of macromolecules, including immunoglobulin G (IgG), to the newborn's bloodstream. Whereas exposed to high concentrations of infectious agents immediately after birth when delivered out of the uterus, puppies are born with very low systemic immunity, with mean serum IgG concentration at about 0.3 g/L versus 8-25 g/L in the adult dog (Poffenbarger et al., 1991; Bouchard et al., 1992; Chastant-Maillard et al., 2012; Mila et al., 2014a) . Transfer of passive immunity from dam to the offspring is thus essentially lactogenic in the canine species, colostrum ensuring both nutrients and immunity provision: at two days of age, mean serum IgG concentration in the puppy rises up to 6-16 g/L, with 85-95% of the immunoglobulins originating from the colostral transfer (Pollock and Carmichael, 1982; Poffenbarger et al., 1991; Sch\u00e4fer-Somi et al., 2005a; Greene and Schultz, 2006; Day, 2007; Chastant-Maillard et al., 2012; Fig. 1) . Even when evaluated to its maximum (two days of age), immunoglobulins concentrations or specific antibody titers acquired by the puppy after colostrum intake remain lower than in the adult dog, reaching between 50 and 77% of the maternal level (Mila et al., 2014a; Gillespie et al., 1958) .",

IgG assay performed via an immuno-enzymatic method (ELISA -Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay) is not an automated process and requires about six hours of laboratory work, limiting its use to scientific purposes. In practice, PIT can be evaluated indirectly through blood gamma-glutamyltransferases (GGT) activity at two days of age: GGT activity in canine colostrum is ten times higher than that in the female blood, whereas GGT activity in puppies' serum at birth is almost absent. Any increase of GGT activity in the newborn's serum is indicative of an ingestion of colostrum (Center et al., 1991) , with an activity below 62U/L diagnosing a deficit in PIT with a 87.5% sensitivity and a 80% specificity (Mila et al., 2017b) . PIT can be also evaluated via specific antibody titer. Indeed, at two days of age, serum IgG concentration and CPV2 specific-antibody titer are positively correlated, with concordant diagnosis of adequate PIT in 88% of puppies; adequate PIT was defined as IgG concentration > 2.3 g/L for general immunity and CPV2-antibody titer > 1:80 for specific immunity evaluation .",

Mugnier, personal communication) . Knowing that dog breeders are forbidden to draw blood samples in most countries, and taking into account the cost of veterinary consultation (ideally at the kennel, since speaking of two-day-old puppies) and the cost of the blood test itself, such blood screening cannot be implemented in practice. An easier and costless method of indirect PIT evaluation is early growth monitoring, i.e. the percentage of weight gain from birth to two days of age, since colostrum provides together energy and immunoglobulins. A growth rate over the first two days of life below \u22122.7% allowed to identify the deficit of PIT in 87-96% of cases, both in terms of general (IgG) and specific (CPV2specific antibodies) immune transfer (Table 1 ; Mila et al., 2018) .",

For the neonate's part, intestinal barrier closure is one of the main factors determining the quality of PIT. Histological description of this phenomenon, non available in the dog, is known in the bovine and porcine species. At birth, tight junctions between enterocytes as well as brush border of these cells are undeveloped. Macromolecules, including immunoglobulins, can pass through digestive mucosa and be absorbed into the lymph and later into the bloodstream.

Bioavailability of colostral immunoglobulins is highly due to a weak proteolytic activity of the digestive system at birth, immature digestive microbiota but also thanks to a high concentration of trypsin inhibitors in the ingested colostrum (1000 times higher than in the mature milk in the cow) (Levieux and Ollier, 1999) . As early as birth, over the first hours of life intestinal permeability decreases: puppies at birth absorb in average 40% of ingested IgG, whereas absorption rate drops at 20% 4 h later, and at only 9% 12 h later. After the first 12-16 h of life, IgG absorption rate is absent (Chastant-Maillard et al., 2012) .",

In the 35 included puppies, the first suckling was observed between five minutes and six hours after birth, with 70% of puppies suckling for the first time during the first two hours.

Depending on their specificity, maternally derived antibodies (MDA) persist until 10-15 days of life (Gooding and Robinson, 1982; Pollock and Carmichael, 1982; Greene and Schultz, 2006; Mila et al., 2014b) . In the dog, the MDA concentration falls at 1 to 3% of the initial level as early as 30 days after birth (Chappuis, 1998) . However, this drop of circulating MDA tends to be accelerated in presence of pathogens in the environment or due to repeated vaccinations, by consumption within the immune response. Immune complexes formed are then secreted into the intestinal lumen through Fc\u03b3Rn receptors (Rath et al., 2013; Greene and Schultz, 2006) . The postnatal drop in MDA seems breed-dependent, with shorter half-time in rapidly growing puppies (Chappuis, 1998) . In parallel to the decrease in MDA, the newborn dog is able to produce its own antibodies since birth, with a significant increase of antibody concentration visible as early as 14-21 days of age (Fig. 1) . [1] With a blood volume equivalent to 7% body weight and a hematocrit of the newborn puppy at 50%, the total volume of serum within a puppy is 3.5 milliliters for 100 g body weight (100 g x 7% x (1-hematocrit)).",

Indeed, MDA persistence at the time of vaccination at about 8 weeks of age is problematic to dog breeders. Although puppies are able to produce antibodies in response to natural infection or vaccination since birth (and even during the fetal life), seroconversion occurs only in the presence of very low levels of specific MDA (Gooding and Robinson, 1982; Chappuis, 1998; Toman et al., 2002; Day, 2007) . A so called immunological gap appears, with remaining MDA preventing the mount of a correct response to vaccination whereas no more providing puppy with adequate immune protection (Decaro et al., 2005) . Among 88 puppies vaccinated against CPV2 between 8 and 10 weeks of age, eight puppies did not develop a protective response due to the presence of MDA (Thibault et al., 2016) . Taking into account the late presence of colostral MDA, a third vaccination at about 16 weeks of age was implemented in 2015 into the international recommended vaccination protocol (WSAVA, 2015; Day, 2017) .",

Except IgA, other nonspecific colostral compounds, such as lysozyme and lactoferrin, participate in the newborn immune response, even though they are considered of minor importance (Handl et al., 2009) . In other domestic animals, white blood cells, such as macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes are other compounds of the PIT: these cells are able to cross the intestinal barrier and enhance neonatal immunity during the first month of life (Liebler-Tenorio et al., 2002; Langel et al., 2015 Langel et al., , 2016 . They release IgA locally when in contact with digestive pathogens (Wheeler et al., 2007) . Globally, colostrum increases the digestive immunity thanks to the presence of non-specific antimicrobial factors, controls the development of the digestive microbiota, modulate development of Peyer's patches and digestive epithelium, participate in the adequate immune response. Stimulation of the intestinal immune system (the most developed one of the entire organism) during the first days of life is essential to adapt the immune response and to limit infections, inflammatory diseases and allergies (Kelly and Coutts, 2000; Rogier et al., 2014) .

An optimal colostrum replacer should provide puppies with an adequate energy but also immune supply, the last one making this nutritional solution a challenge for veterinary industries. Numerous colostrum replacers are potentially available, homo-or heterologous, designed from mammary secretions, blood or egg products. Only a few of them were scientifically evaluated regarding puppies' PIT and/or health. Besides the effect on the systemic PIT, evaluation of the local digestive immune action, as well as its short and long term consequences on the health status of the supplemented animal would be of interest. Whatever the type of colostrum replacer, it should be administrated, similarly as maternal colostrum, during the first eight hours of life, via a baby bottle or a feeding tube. Although bottle feeding is a procedure closer to the physiological suckling, feeding tube allows to control the volume and the time of colostrum ingestion. Dog breeders, often reluctant to tube feeding, should be encouraged to learn this technique, in order to deal with urgent situations and be able to increase chances of appropriate PIT.",

The donor bitch can thus be milked during its second day of lactation.

These antibodies (called IgY, for yolk immunoglobulins) are secreted in the egg yolk at high concentrations and can thus be easily available, in large amounts and in a non invasive way. Benefits of CPV2-specific and E. coli-specific IgY on the canine neonate have been recently demonstrated, as large breed puppies receiving IgY orally once before the intestinal barrier closure presented greater growth rate over the neonatal period (D0-D21) than controls: 824 \u00b1 349 g in IgY supplemented puppies vs 662 \u00b1 334 g in controls, n=334 puppies (Mila et al., 2017a) . Such colostrum alternative containing CPV2-specific and E. coli-specific IgY is available for dog breeders (PuppyProTech, Royal Canin, Aimargues, France). IgY supplementation is a strategy validated in other species (but after intestinal barrier closure; Diraviyam et al., 2014) and promising for the canine newborns since IgY directed against numerous canine pathogenic bacteria (as for example Salmonella), viruses (canine coronavirus CCoV, canine herpesvirus CHV1 \u2026) and parasites (Giardia) could be produced. IgY half-life in the puppy's bloodstream is unknown to date, but probably short, as the half-life of IgY administrated to piglets at 10 h of life was of 1.85 h versus 12 days for homologous IgG (Yokoyama et al., 1993) . Nevertheless, the effect of IgY administration in the newborn probably relies not only on passive immune transfer, and its role on the digestive microbiota and digestive immune competences are to be explored.",
