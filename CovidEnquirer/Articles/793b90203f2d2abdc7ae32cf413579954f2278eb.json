It plays an important role in interaction with receptor and inducing neutralizing antibodies. In the study, six tentative antigenic epitopes (S1 S2 S3 S4 S5 S6) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV were predicted by bio-informatics analysis, and a multi-epitope chimeric gene of S1-S2-S3-S4-S5-S6 was synthesized and fused to downstream GST gene in pGEX-6p-1. The Western blotting demonstrated that SARS patient convalescent serum could recognize the recombinant fusion protein. A number of monoclonal antibodies were developed against the fusion protein. In further, the six predicted epitope genes were individually fused to GST of pGEX-6p-1 and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21, respectively. Among six fusion peptides, S5 reacted with monoclonal antibody D3C5 and S2 reacted with monoclonal antibody D3D1 against spike protein of SARS-CoV. The epitopes recognized by monoclonal antibodies D3C5 and D3D1 are linear, and correspond to 447-458 and 789-799 amino acids of spike protein of SARS-CoV, respectively. Identification of antigenic epitope of spike protein of SARS-CoV could provide the basis for the development of immunity-based prophylactic, therapeutic, and diagnostic techniques for the control of severe acute respiratory syndrome.",

The gene sequence and amino acid sequence have very low homology with any other known animal coronaviruses [4] [5] [6] . Though recently SARS-CoV-like viruses were isolated from Himalayan palm civets [7] , these viruses have not been found in any animal or human being before 2003. And the phylogenetic analysis indicated that the new virus is not related to the known group 1, 2, and 3 coronaviruses and represents a novel coronavirus [8] . So it is proposed as representing a fourth group within the genus Coronavirus, the group 4 coronavirus. Based on available information of other coronaviruses, the spike glycoprotein is the main virulence factor of coronavirus [9] . Spike protein has multiple functions that are involved in specific receptor binding, cell membrane fusion, and protease susceptibility and activation. Spike protein has good antigenicity and could induce neutralization antibodies. These features make it be a suitable candidate for genetic engineering subunit vaccine and diagnostic applications.",

Bound antibodies were determined with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG (sigma) and color was subsequently developed with O-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (sigma) and hydrogen peroxide. The reaction was stopped with 2 M H 2 SO 4 and the absorbance was measured at 490 nm by microplate autoreader (Bio-Rad).",

Epitope is the defined region of an antigen reactive with the corresponding antibody. There are linear and conformational epitopes, linear epitopes are short stretches of the primary structure of the protein and consist of 6-9 or more continuous amino acid residues. Conformational epitopes consist of several amino acid residues that are discrete in the primary sequence but assemble to form an antigenic determinant on the tertiary structure of the native protein. In this study, McAbs D3C5 and D3D1 effectively detected S5 and S2, respectively, in denatured gels (SDS-PAGE). The results indicated that the epitopes S2 and S5 recognized by D3C5 and D3D1 are linear epitopes. Further we examined the reactivity of two McAbs to the 9 AA length subsets of S5 and S2, the precise locations of two epitopes were confirmed. In Western blotting analysis, epitope S2 was reactive with immunized chicken sera. This indicated that epitope S2 is a major epitope in chicken sera. In this report epitope S2 is weakly reactive with convalescent sera. Whether epitope S2 is a major epitope in human needs further investigation. We did not test the reactivity of epitope S2 to more convalescent sera.",

They found that fragments containing the N-terminal amino acid residues 17-537 and 272-537 but not 17-276 bound specifically to Vero E6 cells and purified soluble receptor ACE2. And they confirmed that the receptor-binding domain is located between amino acid residues 303 and 537. Further more, Wong et al. [16] recently reported that a 193-amino-acid fragment of the S protein (residues 318-510) bound ACE2 more efficiently than did the full S1 domain (residues 12-672). And the residue 454 (aspartic acid) is unmutationable in the receptor binding reactivity. The epitope S2 (447-458) we identified here locates spang in receptor binding domain.
