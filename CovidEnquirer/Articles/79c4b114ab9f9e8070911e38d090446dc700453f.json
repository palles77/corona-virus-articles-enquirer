            "text": "Special Features C OPD is characterized by a progressive deterioration of lung function and mental and physical comorbidities such as depression, dystrophy, and heart failure. 1 The data suggest that COPD imposes an enormous burden on patients, health-care professionals, and society. COPD contributes to morbidity and mortality and to a signifi cant use of health-care resources and expense on a global scale; this is especially true in developing countries. 2-4 The burden of COPD in China is currently greater than that found in developed countries. This is probably due to greater exposure to epidemic risk factors, an imbalance in economic development, and health-care disparities between urban and rural areas. The reported prevalence of COPD Although, to our knowledge, there has been no exhaustive or credible review of the evidence of the disease burden of COPD in China, COPD has become an increasing public health concern to the Chinese medical community. The purpose of this article is to review the evidence and evaluate and clarify the disease burden of COPD in China with the aim of improving effective management. We reviewed previous studies of COPD in China, which included data on prevalence, mortality, disease burden, risk factors, diagnosis, and management by searching related Web sites, including PubMed, ProQuest, and Thomson Reuters' Web of Knowledge, as well as major Chinese databases and government Web sites. Reported COPD prevalence varied between 5% and 13% in different provinces/cities across China. In 2008, COPD ranked fourth as a leading cause of death in urban areas and third in rural areas. In addition, COPD accounted for 1.6% of all hospital admissions in China in that year. The high prevalence of smoking and biomass fuel use acted as major contributors to the high occurrence of COPD in China. Management of COPD in China should focus on adjusting the distribution of medical resources and on addressing public health policies to facilitate earlier diagnosis in rural areas, aim to reduce smoking prevalence, improve patients' self-management, and keep physicians' knowledge up to date and consistent with current guidelines. COPD is one of the most challenging medical issues facing China because of its infl uence on both personal and public health and its impact on the economy. Optimal management strategies should be adopted and strengthened immediately.",

            "text": "When cor pulmonale deaths with documented COPD history were included, COPD-related mortality increased to 179.9 for men and to 141.3 for women per 100,000 persons. 24 Both rates were much higher than the corresponding estimated rates in the Asia-Pacifi c region (64-92 per 100,000 population in men and 21-35 per 100,000 population in women). 25 It was reported that COPD-related mortality was higher in rural areas than in urban areas, mainly because of the unavailability of health-care resources and more exposure to indoor air pollution. Another fi nding showed that COPD-related mortality in northern China was higher than in other locations; 24 the higher mortality rate in the north might be associated with a colder climate, more use of biomass fuel, heavier outdoor air pollution, and lower socioeconomic status. Although mortality rates fell, hospitalization rates continued to rise in the last decade. Hospitalization rates for COPD jumped from 1.0% in 1998 (urban vs rural was 1.4% vs 0.8%) to 1.6% in 2008 (urban vs rural was 1.5% vs 1.6%). Correspondingly, the gap between rural and urban areas narrowed ( Fig 1B ) . 22 This is partially a result of the increase in incidence but it also indicates that patients in rural areas are more aware of COPD, and that resources for rural residents have been increasing. The hospitalization rate trend is consistent with that of other Asian countries. 26 Burden of COPD COPD treatments are extremely costly in China and impose an enormous economic burden on both families and society. Health-care expenses were inves tigated with person-to-person interviews in a cross-sectional survey conducted among 723 COPD out patients in six large cities in China. 27 It was found that the annual direct medical expense for urban patients in 2006 was $1732.24 per patient, whereas the estimated indirect expense spent on nutraceutics, transportation, and end-of-life care was $231.6 per patient. Total expense for one COPD patient ($1963.8) accounted for 40% of the average family's total income ($4849.8) . Evidence showed that the cost of COPD was strongly correlated with the severity of disease and that hospitalization acted as a major contributor to total cost. 26, 28 It was suggested that reducing hospitalization frequency through better management could result in a crucial decrease in health-care expenses. Moreover, the burden of COPD has been underestimated consistently because of premature mortality and impaired productivity of patients and their family members. The overall disease burden, measured by disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), was predicted to double over the next 2.5 decades worldwide, at which point COPD would move from the 13th-highest cause of DALYs",

A population-based, cross-sectional survey of COPD conducted between 2002 and 2004 showed that the overall prevalence of the disease in people aged . 40 years was 8.2%, 5 which would result in a COPD patient population of . 43 million in that time period. It was reported that the prevalence of COPD varied widely among locations across the country, from 5% to 13% ( Table 1 ) . [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Most locations had a higher prevalence of COPD than the World Health Organization model-estimated prevalence for China (6.7%) 20 and the reported prevalence rates in Western countries (4%-10%). 21 But the cross-sectional survey of COPD results were consistent with the pooled prevalence (meta-analysis) of the Western Pacifi c Region (9.0%). 3 The crude prevalence of COPD was significantly higher in men than in women (8.3%-18.9% vs 3.8%-7.1%), in rural areas than in urban areas (4.4%-16.7% vs 6.7%-8.3%), in the elderly, and in nonsmoking rural women. These differences were associated with gender, smoking status, biomass fuel use, occupational dust exposure, socioeconomic status, and availability of health-care resources. It was reported that approximately two-thirds of the patients were underdiagnosed, and the prevalence of diagnosed COPD in rural areas was apparently lower than that in urban areas, 21 suggesting an inferior diagnostic rate in rural areas.",

An updated meta-analysis of 16 studies on such hydrolase polymorphisms in COPD in the Asian population suggested that the slow activity phenotype of the enzyme is associated with an increased risk of COPD, and the fast activity phenotype is a protective factor in the development of COPD. 59 Genetic polymorphism in Heme oxygenase-1, one of the antioxidant enzymes, was found to be associated with the severity of COPD in southwest China. 60,61 g -Glutamylcysteine synthetase and 8-hydroxy-guanine glycosylase both play roles in the antioxidant defenses, and both were reported to be not associated with susceptibility to COPD in a southern Chinese population. 62 Polymorphisms of IL-27 gene, 63 matrix metalloproteinase-9 gene, 64 tumor necrosis factor-a , 65-67 and aquaporin 5 68,69 were demonstrated to play roles in susceptibility to COPD.

Early diagnosis may help patients quit smoking and lead to the adoption of effective therapies to prevent progres- monary physicians, showed that expectorants were the most often prescribed medications, followed by b 2 -agonists and anticholinergics. 97 Instead of longacting bronchodilators, more than one-half of the patients were prescribed short-or medium-acting bronchodilators, which was inconsistent with the guidelines. 81 Most of the physicians underused oxygen therapy, noninvasive intermittent positive pressure ventilation, and antiinfl ammation therapy. 82 Only 20% of the primary care physicians were fully knowledgeable about pharmacologic therapies for COPD. 98 Prospects COPD represents a challenging issue because of its impact on both personal and public health and its economic consequences. There is an urgent need to understand the present and future burden of COPD in China from well-designed epidemiologic studies on its prevalence and morbidity. Because of ethnic differences, studies on genetic susceptibility to COPD among the Chinese population should be carried out to improve prevention and lead to early diagnosis. Because China is the world's largest cigarette manufacturer and because it is the world's largest consumer of cigarettes, there is a great challenge to restrict and regulate smoking in China with an intent to reduce the burden of COPD. During the last decade, smoking prevention and cessation programs have been implemented widely and preliminary results have been observed ( Tables 2, 3 ) . 29, 99, 100 However, there are many factors affecting the execution of smoking laws and regulations by the government. Rural workers, teenagers, and women with high or rising rates of smoking need to be targeted specifi cally for tobaccocontrol measures. The existing public health policies should be strengthened and new strategies, including raising taxes and the price of cigarettes, should be put into effect. On the other hand, physicians should take the leading role in the fi ght against smoking. It has been found that about 40% of male physicians are current smokers, 101 which adds to the diffi culty of smoking control. patients diagnosed with COPD received a spirometry test. [6] [7] [8] In 185 previously diagnosed COPD patients, 67 were confi rmed by spirometry based on diagnostic criteria, 47 had normal lung function, and 63 had mixed ventilation disorder. 88 Profound underuse of spirometry was considered to be a barrier to decent care of Chinese COPD patients. 89 Barriers hindering use of spirometry in clinical practice include ignorance of the crucial role of spirometry, facility inaccessibility, and limited budgets, especially in most of the primary care settings.",

Screening by spirometry is impractical in most primary care settings and rural areas, indicating the urgent need for disease-specifi c biomarkers to facilitate early diagnosis and identify high-risk populations. 102, 103 Management techniques of COPD should take into consideration cultural variations and mental and physical comorbidities, such as psychologic depression. Comorbidities could infl uence patients' quality of life, increase hospitalization, and reduce survival. The role played by fi nances should also be taken into account to improve the poor management of COPD. For example, the cost for drug therapy ($443-$738 per year) in the maintenance phase is a huge economic burden for families and individuals, especially for rural residents. Less than 40% of patients with chronic hypoxemia use oxygen therapy because the cost ($517 per year) is too high. It is necessary to implement a community-based comprehensive intervention, which requires support from national polices, to ensure the availability of medical resources, such as essential drugs, equipment, and human resources, and to improve the affordability of COPD therapy for patients. Continuous educational programs on quality-improving skills and management strategies should be more effective and comprehensive in China to improve health-care quality and physicians' clinical practice skills and to reduce health-care disparities among regions and economic groups.",
