Using a newly established human monoclonal anti-M antibody we detected glycosylated and nonglycosylated membrane-associated M in severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infected cells and in purified virions. Further analyses revealed that M contained a single N-glycosylation site at asparagine 4. Recombinant M was transported to the plasma membrane and gained complex-type N-glycosylation. In SARS-CoV infected cells and in purified virions, however, N-glycosylation of M remained endoglycosidase H-sensitive suggesting that trimming of the N-linked sugar side chain is inhibited.",

The coronavirus glycoprotein M is the most abundant protein of the viral particle and plays a crucial role in assembly and budding of virions [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . In silico analysis suggested that SARS-CoV M consists of a long cytoplasmic tail, three transmembrane segments and a short N-terminal ectodomain harbouring one potential N-glycosylation site. To characterize SARS-CoV M, we took advantage of a human monoclonal antibody (S30) derived from Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized memory B-cells of a SARS convalescent [9] . In this study, we applied immunofluorescence analyses and biochemical approaches to investigate glycosylation and intracellular distribution of SARS-CoV M in infected cells and after recombinant expression.",

This treatment led to a shift of both M-specific bands to 18 and 23 kDa, respectively, suggesting that glycosylated and nonglycosylated M are partially protected against the proteinase K digestion (Fig. 1D, lanes 1 and  2) . The molecular weight of the two proteolytic peptides was slightly larger than expected if the complete cytoplasmic domain (11 kDa) was removed. Possibly, hydrophobic residues located near the third transmembrane domain are peripherally attached to the microsomal membrane and thereby protected against protease treatment [4] . The addition of the detergent Triton X-100 to the protease K digestion led to the complete proteolysis of both forms of M (Fig. 1D, lane 3) . These results are consistent with the presumption of a long cytoplasmic domain of M. The potential N exo -C exo -topology of TGEV-M [10, 11] seems not to appear in M of SARS-CoV.",

Cell lysates were analysed by immunoprecipitation using S30-antibody and SDS-PAGE ( Fig. 2A) . Right after labelling both, glycosylated and nonglycosylated M was detectable (lane 4). The amount of nonglycosylated M remained constant throughout the chase period whereas the level of Endo H-sensitive M decreased ( Fig. 2A ''M ER '') . Concomitantly, Endo H-resistant forms ranging from 29 to 35 kDa appeared and their amount increased during the chase ( Fig. 2A ''M Golgi '') . This result suggested that upon recombinant expression, glycosylated M is transported through ER and Golgi-complex and gains complex-glycosylated sugar side chains a result, which confirmed data presented by Nal et al. Expanding their experimental approach, we were able to avoid any effect of epitope tags on the distribution and posttranslational modification and further to analyse the glycosylation and transport of M in the viral context using the M-specific human monoclonal antibody. To this end, Vero cells were infected with SARS-CoV and pulse-chase experiments were performed under BSL-4 conditions as described before (Fig. 2B) . During the chase, the ratio between nonglycosylated and glycosylated M remained constant, and no Endo H-resistant forms appeared (Fig. 2B , lanes 4-21) suggesting that processing of N-linked glycans is prevented in SARS-CoV-infected cells. Completely synthesized membrane associated nonglycosylated M is no target for Nlinked glycosylation suggesting that the protein has been transported out of the ER. This is underlined by the finding that nonglycosylated M is incorporated into the virion. This indicated that glycosylation of M is neither a prerequisite for intracellular transport nor for recruitment into virions which has been shown previously for other coronavirus M proteins [4, [12] [13] [14] .",

Alternatively, M expressing cells were incubated with an anti-ERGIC (ER-Golgi-intermediate-compartment) antibody and S30 and respective fluorescently labelled secondary antibodies. While the signals for M and Golgi-marker or ERGIC strongly colocalized, no or only a partial colocalization was observed with ER-or endosomal-marker (Fig. 3B) . These results are in line with previous studies on SARS-CoV [21] and other coronaviruses [22] [23] [24] , showing that recombinant M is enriched in the Golgi-complex region. It is therefore presumed that differences in Endo H sensitivity of M in transfected and infected cells are not caused by a different intracellular distribution. More likely, trimming of the sugar side chain was prevented in the infected cell by the presence of S which sterically hindered the access of glycosidases. Results from Opstelten et al., showing that S and M of mouse hepatitis virus interact during the assembly of progeny, point into this direction [4, 7, 25, 26] .",

N-Flag-M was recognized at the surface and intracellularly (Fig. 4 , upper panels). The C-Flag-M, however, was only detectable in permeabilized cells confirming the intactness of the plasma membrane during the staining procedure and that the C-terminus of M, indeed, faces the cytoplasm (Fig. 4, lower panels) . These results indicated that singly expressed M is transported to the cell-surface and confirmed the results of the complex-type Nglycosylation analyses.

            "text": "Taken together, our results confirm existing data showing that recombinant SARS-CoV M protein is N-glycosylated and located at steady state in the Golgi apparatus. Our results extend existing data in showing that Asp at position 4 is the only glycosylation attachment site of M and the recombinant protein is transported to the plasma membrane. Due to unknown reasons, M in SARS-CoV infected cells is not complex glycosylated. Both, recombinant and virion incorporated M is also present in a nonglycosylated form. Future studies have to clarify the significance of nonglycosylated, virion incorporated M for e.g. induction of IFN-a/b in SARS-CoV-infected cells [28] or the release of cytokines during infection [29] .",
