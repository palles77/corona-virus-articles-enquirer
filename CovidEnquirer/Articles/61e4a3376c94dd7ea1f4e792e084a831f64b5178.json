The second virial coefficient, b 2 , derived from the dilution enthalpies of protein solution measured by ITC under various experimental conditions was studied. The protein applied in this work is human recombinant interferon-\u24232a (hrIFN-\u24232a), which is a commercial drug applied for the treatment of virus-infected diseases. The results obtained were used to predict the possibility of hrIFN-\u24232a aggregation, and the prediction can be further confirmed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Various factors affecting the stability of protein solution were investigated, for example, temperature, salts, surfactants, and mechanical stress. Specifically, the results show that the dilution enthalpy of hrIFN-\u24232a increased with increasing temperature and NaCl concentration, while b 2 decreased, indicating that the attraction between hrIFN-\u24232a molecules was enhanced under these conditions. On studying the effect of mechanical stress, the data obtained reveals that the introduction of centrifugal or vortex force strengthened the attractive forces between hrIFN-\u24232a molecules. These implications were supported by SEC data, demonstrating that the amount of aggregated hrIFN-\u24232a was increased. As a consequence, the methodologies presented in this investigation offer a possibility of monitoring the physical stability of protein solution at various stages of recovery, purification as well as the development of appropriate drug storage formulations.",

It is accepted that a negative value of b 2 indicates a global attraction between the molecules, implying a high possibility of aggregation. In addition, b 2 , can be derived from osmotic measurements as well. The osmotic b 2 can provide a thermodynamic link between molecular structure and the potential of attractions at various solution conditions, similar to the one measured by calorimetry. However, the amount of sample required for measuring this coefficient by membrane osmometry, or light scattering is much larger than by calorimetry (Haynes et al., 1992; Velev et al., 1998; Bajaj et al., 2004) . This drawback limits the application of this coefficient for those pharmaceutical proteins with low concentrations and limited amounts.",

Interferons (IFNs) are a group of proteins, which can be produced by various cells upon infection by viruses and double strain RNAs (Sen, 2001) . Specifically, IFNs can be divided into two groups in accordance with their various cell surface receptors and unrelated structural properties: IFN-\u2423, \u2424, , \u2426 and belong to type I IFN (among them, IFN-\u2423 has many subtypes such as IFN-\u24232a, IFN-\u24232b), while only IFN-\u2425 is a type II IFN (Stepwart et al., 1980) . IFNs have great potential as drugs for the treatment of various virus-infected diseases such as hepatitis C (Lake-Bakaar, 2001) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Cinatl et al., 2003) , but they are very unstable, and their activities can be reduced during bioprocessing, storage, freezing as well as lyophilizing.

The corresponding statistic data were summarized in Table 1 . Since the heat of dilution indicates the interactions between protein molecules and/or other small molecules, such as salts, the dilution enthalpy change of a protein solution should be an index of the interactions between protein molecules. For instance, a positive (endothermic) value for dilution enthalpy implies that there are attractive forces between the protein molecules, that is, the protein unfavorably dissolves into the buffer solution. In this study, the results reveal that the interactions between the hrIFN-\u24232a molecules were attractive and increased with temperature. This is mainly attributed to enhanced hydrophobic interactions, resulting from the structural changes to the protein under the heating process. Since the compact conformation of the protein became loosely at a higher temperature and gradually exposed its hydrophobic regions to the solvent, increased hydrophobic attractions thus can be expected. The study of Sharma and Kalonia (2003) on temperature effect of hrIFN-\u24232a structure by circular dichroism also reveals that a significant loss in the tertiary structure of hrIFN-\u24232a by increasing temperature from 15 to 50 \u2022 C.",

This is because in the presence of salts, the native structure of hrIFN-\u24232a shifts towards being less compact and the solvent-exposed hydrophobic surfaces increased, leading to stronger hydrophobic interactions between protein molecules. Furthermore, the strength of electro-repulsion between hrIFN-\u24232a molecules would seem to be decreased with increasing salt concentrations. Consequently, protein aggregation can be caused either by enhancing hydrophobic interactions or by decreasing electro-repulsive forces between hrIFN-\u24232a molecules. The SEC chromatogram also confirms this. In Fig. 7 , the chromatogram shows that an additional peak with a molecular weight of about 44.7 kDa mainly due to aggregation of hrIFN-\u24232a appeared in the 0.5 M NaCl condition as compared to blank condition.

The study of Beldarrain et al. (2001) also demonstrates that the stabilization of hrIFN-\u24232a is highly dependent on the salt species and ionic strength. As a consequence, the aggregation of hrIFN-\u24232a can be increased by adding salts and increasing the salt concentra- tion, although salts usually serve as an isotonizing agent in commercial IFN formulations (Gross, 1998; Yuen and Kline, 1999) .",

The data show that the attractive forces between hrIFN-\u24232a molecules changed at the pH values studied. Specifically, at pH 6, the attraction between hrIFN-\u24232a is much stronger than that at pH 7 or 8. This is because at pH 6, which is near the pI of hrIFN-\u24232a (5.7), the protein becomes electro-neutralized, the repulsions between the protein molecules are minimized and the hydrophobic attractions enhanced. This is also supported by the literature (Yuen and Kline, 1999) , where the formation of hrIFN-\u24232a aggregation as well as the adsorption of hrIFN-\u24232a onto the glass surface, reached a maximum at pH 5-6. Note that selection of an optimal pH value for an IFN solution needs careful consideration. For example, in addition to physical stability as discussed above, the degradation of hrIFN-\u24232a can be minimized at a pH near pI (Yuen and Kline, 1999) . Therefore, an optimal pH value for stabilizing the IFN solution should be determined by analysis of a variety of factors.",

The data shown on Table 1 demonstrate that the attractions between hrIFN-\u24232a molecules can be significantly increased by mechanical stress, partly due to change in the structural conformation of hrIFN-\u24232a molecule, especially under vortex conditions. This observation is further confirmed by the SEC results. As shown in Fig. 7 , an additional peak with a molecular weight higher than 67 kDa (out of the calibration range) was obtained under vortex treatment compared to the untreated condition, and this is probably the aggregated form of hrIFN-\u24232a. This is also similar to a previous report (Bam et al., 1998) , where the \u2423-helical content of IFN-\u2425 decreased with the introduction of mechanical stress, such as agitation, leading to the irreversible conformational changes and this favored protein aggregation. It should be noted that the significant effect of vortexing is probably more a result of the exposure to air (hydrophobic interface) than the solely changes in protein structure. Furthermore, the process of inactivation by mechanical stress during bioprocessing probably involves either the linking together of the sulfhydryl groups or disulfide interchange reactions to form inter or intra-molecular disulfide bridges, leading IFN to adopt a biologically inactive configuration. From this point of view, reducing agents such as reduced glutathione, can be applied to retain IFN sulfhydryl groups in a reduced state without affecting the disulfide linkages which are essential for IFN activity (Yuen and Kline, 1999) .",

The results presented in Table 1 demonstrate that the attractions between hrIFN-\u24232a molecules can be minimized with the addition of Tween 20, probably because the hydrophobic patches on the hrIFN-\u24232a surface are able to bond with (or are blocked by) this non-ionic surfactant, and therefore, there is a decrease in the hydrophobic interactions. Specifically, the attractions between hrIFN-\u24232a decreased with the concentration of Tween 20, although the difference in b 2 values between 0.01 and 0.02% of Tween 20 is not significant.

The latter interaction may also be seen as an increase in the repulsive inter-molecular forces. In this study, a brief survey on the effects of interactions between hrIFN-\u24232a molecules was achieved by ITC measurements and SEC so as to evaluate the applicability of the calorimetric b 2 . The data obtained shows that the storage of hrIFN-\u24232a solution at a low temperature and/or at a pH away from its pI, together with a limitation of mechanical stress on the protein in the presence of the correct concentration of a surfactant such as Tween 20 can really decrease attractive protein-protein interactions and thus minimizes hrIFN-\u24232a aggregation. However, it should be noted that the addition of salts can stabilize the structural conformation of hrIFN-\u24232a, but also enhances protein aggregation as well. These data demonstrate that the identification of a formulation able to stabilize protein physically will depend critically on balancing the intra-and inter-molecular forces. As a consequence, optimization of protein stability requires a systematic approach, and our results show that using ITC to carry out such a systematic study of the physical stability of protein solution is possible.",
