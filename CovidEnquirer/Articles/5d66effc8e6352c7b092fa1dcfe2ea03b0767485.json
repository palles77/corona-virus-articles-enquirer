The objective of the study was to develop and evaluate permeable membranes (PVA/PEI) impregnated with reactive nanoparticulates (POM) that can protect against simulants of chemical and biological warfare agents. The physical properties of the PVA/PEI-POM hybrids were examined using SEM, TEM, TGA, and UV-Vis spectroscopy, the results of which indicated that the POM was incorporated in the PVA/PEI matrix after impregnation. The redox properties against 2-chloroethyl-ethyl sulfide (CEES) were investigated based on significant color changes and UV absorption in the POM upon reduction by CEES. The antibacterial effects of the PVA/PEI-POM hybrids were assessed by the zone of inhibition, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and plate-counting methods. The results of this study showed that PVA/PEI-POM hybrids that act against simulants of chemical and biological weapons while retaining their ability to transmit moisture vapor could be obtained.",

            "text": "It has been discovered that the specially-created Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) at Porton Down has developed, in collaboration with industry, a novel polymeric material that demonstrates both moisture vapor permeability and chemical barrier properties [1] . This material is composed of two water-soluble polymers, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and poly (ethyleneimine) (PEI). The selectively permeable material acts as a complete barrier towards toxic liquid, vapor and aerosol challenges yet allows moisture vapor to permeate, consequently representing a leap forward in the area of protective garment design. PVA can be considered a good host material for metals and semiconductors due to its good thermo-stability, chemical resistance and gas barrier properties [2] . Moreover, it contains a carbon backbone with hydroxyl groups attached to methane carbons; these hydroxyl groups can be a source of hydrogen bonding, hence assisting in the formation of polymer blends [3] . PEI is a hyperbranched amine polymer based on aziridine that has widespread applications in adhesives, coatings, textile manufacture, food packaging and cosmetics. PEI-treated cotton fabric has also been shown by the Dstl to be an excellent scavenger of sulfur mustard (HD) and soman (GD) vapors: this may be attributed to the nucleophilic amine groups, which can react with electrophilic species such as these [4] .",

Many classes of POMs undergo rapid, reversible redox changes. They are of proven value in catalysis and other areas, partly because their extremely versatile redox potentials, acidities, polarities, solubilities, and other properties can be readily altered synthetically. Several types of POM change color when they are reduced. So, if a chemical warfare agent (CWA) with an oxidizable group, such as the sulfur atom in HD or possibly in VX, were to come into contact with the POM-cream mixture, the POM would be reduced (the HD or VX oxidized). Because the reduced POM (POM Red ) and the oxidized POM (POM Ox ) are different colors, the wearer would therefore have a facile indicator or warning of the presence of the CWA [10] [11] [12] -in other words, the agent would be detected by the POM-cream mixture. If the POM in the cream catalyzes the O 2 -based oxidation and/or hydrolysis of the CWA, the POM-cream could be catalytically decontaminating as well as detecting.",

So far, various biological effects of POMs have been reported in terms of antitumor and antivirus activities [16, 17] . With regard to the antibacterial activity of POMs, we found that polyoxometalates with Keggin, lacunary Keggin, Wells-Dawson, double-Keggin, and Keggin-sandwich structures enhanced the antibacterial activity of b-lactam antibiotics on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) [18] , Helicobacter pylori [19] and the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [20] [21] [22] .",

The cumulative mass of vapor permeating the swatch per unit area during the 24 h test was based on the mass permeated in the time interval over the effective swatch area, which was the opening in the permeation cell (1.1304 cm 2 ).

This is characteristic of the facilitated transport mechanism, and clearly demonstrates that PEI functions efficiently as a carrier of vapor in the blend membrane. Chu and Yang investigated the effect of heat-treatment of a PVA membrane on water permeation through the membrane [28] , and found that as the duration of heat-treatment increased, the density of the crosslinking formed by the condensation reaction between molecular chains increased, which resulted in a lower water permeation rate. This is attributable to the decrease in the pore size of PVA brought about by the increase in the crosslinking density. The TEM image of the Polymer/POM-8 hybrid solution showed non-agglomerated, scattered spherical POM particles at a low concentration, of sizes in the range of less than 20 nm (Fig. 1C) .

The thermal decomposition temperatures in the 300-480 C region were enhanced and in the 480-550 C region were weakened for the Polymer/POM hybrids, and these effects increased with increasing POM content. On the other hand, the char yield (Y c ) in the degradation of the Polymer/POM hybrids was found to be proportional to the POM content. These results indicate that the thermal stability of the hybrid is influenced by the POM. This observation was further illustrated by the DTG curves obtained as a function of temperature. The weight loss below 200 C is due to the degradation of water and small molecules, and the weight loss between 200 and 300 C is attributed to the decomposition of hydrogen bonds between PVA and the PEI polymer. The weight loss in the intervals of 300-450 C and 450-600 C is attributed to the decomposition of the PEI and PVA units, respectively. Moreover, the PVA-POM (430-500 C) units, respectively. The weight loss in the 430-500 C region, which is absent for the PVA/PEI blend, is mainly attributed to thermo-oxidative degradation of the PVA-POM units. Moreover, the degradation temperature of the PEI units is lower and the PVA units are higher as compared with those of the PVA/PEI blend. The DTG curves show that the POM weakens the rate of the scission of PVA chains, while the same rate of the PEI chains is almost constant. On the basis of the above observations, it is thought that the PVA chains with hydroxyl groups could exert chelating behavior, and this may be due to the coordination between O and the POM. Consequently, the thermo-oxidative stability of the hybrids was influenced by the inclusion of the inorganic component. Such a consequence may be due to the enhancement of heat transfer as a result of the increase in mobility of the POM, which leads to an increase in scission in the PEI chains, resulting in a reduction in scission within the PVA chains.",

The MIC values of the Polymer/POM hybrids against bacteria were 0.02-20 mg/mL and were lower than that of the Polymer blend (2-20 mg/ mL). Thus, it is likely that the highly-negative charge of the POM stimulates the cell to result in facilitation of the bacterial morphological change from bacillary form to coccid form, reflecting bacterial death [19] . Fig. 9 shows the number of bacterial colonies grown on MH plates as a function of the amount of Polymer/POM-8 hybrid when approximately 10 7 CFU of S. aureus were applied to the plates. The size of the bacterial colonies grown on plates with more than 50 mg of Polymer/POM-8 particles was significantly reduced, and the antibacterial performance would therefore be improved greatly with increasing amounts of Polymer/POM-8 particles. The dynamics of bacterial growth were also monitored in MH medium supplemented with 10 7 CFU S. aureus cells and with 50 mg of Polymer/POM-8 under different inoculation durations. Fig. 10 demonstrates that the bacterial colonies of Gram-positive S. aureus were completely killed after 24 h of inoculation and the percentage reduction of bacteria was approximately 100% after 8-48 h of inoculation. The mechanism of the antibacterial activity of the POM against the Gram-negative strains is considered to be as follows: the fluorescent X-ray analysis results showed uptake of the POM into the bacterial cell. The Gram-negative strains can take the hydrophilic compounds into the periplasmic space through the porin protein, which is a pore-forming protein working towards the penetration of the hydrophilic compound in the outer membrane [19] .

When CEES comes into contact with the Polymer/POM hybrids, the hybrids change from orange to blue in ca. 1 h at ambient temperature, exhibiting a potential HD-detecting capability.

The structure and negatively-charged anion characteristics of the POM are important in the antibacterial activity against Gram microbes. Further study is still needed in order to validate that these material systems are robust enough to survive the military environment, but the initial test results are very positive.

This observation reveals that the POM reduces the decomposition of the PEI polymer chain but enhances the decomposition of the PVA polymer chain.Fig. 4shows the TGA and DTG curves of the PVA/PEI blend and the Polymer/POM hybrids under air. The major mass loss of the PVA/PEI blend in the 200-430 C region is attributed to the decomposition of the PVA-PEI crosslinking chains. It can be seen that the DTG curves of the Polymer/POM hybrids exhibit three clear stages in the 200-500 C region, which can be attributed to the decomposition of the PEI (200-320 C), PVA (320-430 C), and",
