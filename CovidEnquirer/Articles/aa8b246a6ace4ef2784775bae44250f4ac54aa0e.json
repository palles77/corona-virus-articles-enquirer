This paper describes methods for highly reproducible absolute viral load measurements using external standard curves generated with either ISAV recombinant plasmid DNA (pDNA) standards or transcribed RNA standards prepared by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase, and using a two tube real-time or quantitative (q)RT-PCR with SYBR \u00ae Green I chemistry and a single tube qRT-PCR with TaqMan \u00ae probe chemistry. When applied to virus samples of known virus titer for the highly pathogenic ISAV strain NBISA01 and the low pathogenic ISAV strain RPC/NB-04-085-1, both methods showed a 100-fold lower detectable titer for RPC/NB-04-085-1 but with a higher number of viral RNA molecules compared to NBISA01. Overall, the SYBR \u00ae Green I method overestimated copy numbers in samples having equivalent Ct values with the TaqMan \u00ae probe method. Taken together, the findings suggest that the TaqMan \u00ae probe method with the in vitro transcribed RNA standard curve is the preferred method for reliable and rapid quantitation of ISAV in samples.",

The genome is composed of eight segments of linear, single-stranded (ss)RNA of negative sense ranging in length from 1.0 to 2.4 kb with a total molecular size of approximately 14.3 kb (Clouthier et al., 2002) . The fish disease is reportable with the World Animal Health Organization (OIE). Virus can be detected in fish tissues by RT-PCR (Mjaaland et al., 1997) , electron microscopy (Hovland et al., 1994) , indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT), and by virus isolation using permissive fish cell lines (Dannevig et al., 1995; Bouchard et al., 1999; Kibenge et al., 2001) . Comparison of the different methods showed the RT-PCR method to be the most sensitive for virus detection (Snow et al., 2003) .",

Absolute quantitation requires construction of a standard curve using relevant standards such as a known copy num-ber of plasmid DNA (pDNA) or in vitro transcribed RNA standards (Bustin, 2000; Wong and Medrano, 2005) . Relative quantitation describes the change in expression of the target gene relative to some untreated reference sample and normalized to a reference gene, usually a housekeeping gene (reviewed in Giulietti et al., 2001; Livak and Schmittgen, 2001) . It is becoming increasingly apparent that more than one reference gene is required for proper use of relative quantitation (a minimum of three reference genes is recommended), making it cumbersome to use let alone to compare test performance between different laboratories. Moreover, housekeeping genes are not necessarily appropriate references for qRT-PCR data normalization (Sellars et al., 2007) . In contrast, absolute quantitation analysis is useful in determining absolute viral RNA copies based on a constant, allowing straight forward comparison of data from different PCR runs on the same day or on different days, and more importantly between different laboratories.",

            "text": "There are two chemistries used most commonly for detection of PCR products during qRT-PCR. These are the DNA binding fluorophore SYBR \u00ae Green I (Simpson et al., 2000) , and the sequence-specific fluorescently labeled probes (Holland et al., 1991; Lay and Wittwer, 1997) . Quantitation of ISAV by qRT-PCR first utilized the SYBR \u00ae Green I format, targeting RNA segment 8 (Munir and Kibenge, 2004) , and then subsequently used TaqMan \u00ae probes initially targeting RNA segment 8 (Mjaaland et al., 2005) and then comparing RNA segments 7 and 8 (Snow et al., 2006) . The authors found the segment 8 TaqMan \u00ae qRT-PCR assay to be more sensitive than the segment 7 TaqMan \u00ae qRT-PCR assay (Snow et al., 2006) . All the previous ISAV quantitation reports have used relative quantitation of ISAV transcripts calibrated to housekeeping genes (Mjaaland et al., 2005; Kileng et al., 2006; J\u00f8rgensen et al., 2007; Snow et al., 2006) , however, there has never been correlation with biological significance of the amount of viral RNA detected in a sample. Using expression of reference/housekeeping genes is relevant when studying gene expression, but has less relevance in viral quantitation except for estimating the quality of the RNA in a sample and detecting presence of inhibitory effects. This report describes the use of ISAV segment 8 pDNA and in vitro transcribed RNA standards for absolute quantification of ISAV RNA copy number equivalents in both a two tube qRT-PCR using SYBR \u00ae Green I and a single tube one-step qRT-PCR with a TaqMan \u00ae probe. Moreover, this study established the relationship of qRT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value to median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) when used to assess viral load in a sample for ISAV isolates of differing pathogenicities. Considering the replication strategy of influenza viruses, ISAV replication is expected to generate viral mRNA and cRNA from the vRNA genome. When primed with gene specific primer or random hexamers, the total RNA from ISAV-infected cultures will have a population of cDNA generated from viral mRNA, cRNA, and vRNA. It is possible to specifically amplify ISAV vRNA by priming the noncoding UTR region in the RT step with sequence specific primer but this requires a two-step RT-PCR to allow RNase treatment before addition of a second gene specific primer in the PCR step. Thus, the idea of relating transcript copies to ISAV genome equivalents is limited when using cDNA primers that are not specific for vRNA, although this method was used for absolute quantitation of coronavirus (Vijgen et al., 2005) , a non-segmented ssRNA virus of positive sense. When quantitating segmented RNA viruses the question would be how many individual genome segments are contained in an infectious virus particle? ISAV is not well studied in this respect; but influenza virions containing more than eight individual RNA segments have been isolated (Flint et al., 2004) . Thus for the present study, in order to extrapolate the segment 8 ISAV copies as ISAV RNA copy number equivalents, an assumption was made that the genome in a single infectious ISAV particle has at least one molecule of each RNA segment.",

NBISA01 is a highly pathogenic strain belonging to the North American genotype, whereas RPC/NB 04-085-1 is a low pathogenic strain of the European genotype found in Eastern Canada (Kibenge et al., 2006) . The two isolates have variations in the amino acid sequence of the haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein, with deletions of 13 and 17 amino acids in the highly polymorphic region (HPR) for RPC/NB 04-085-1 and NBISA01, respectively (Kibenge et al., 2007) . In an experimental trial using equal viral doses, NBISA01 induced very high mortality in Atlantic salmon (95%) and moderate mortality in rainbow trout (50%), whereas RPC/NB 04-085-1 induced very low mortality in Atlantic salmon (18.2%) and no mortality in rainbow trout (Kibenge et al., 2006) . These ISAV isolates were propagated in the TO cell line (Wergeland and Jakobsen, 2001) and the cell lysates were titrated on TO cell monolayers as described previously (Kibenge et al., 2001) . For serial sampling during virus replication, virus was propagated in 24 h-old TO cell monolayers (\u223c80% confluent) in six-well tissue culture plates. Infected cells were incubated at 16 \u2022 C in maintenance medium. Sampling was done at days 0, 3 and 6 by freezing the whole plate at \u221280 \u2022 C prior to the total RNA extraction step.",

Preliminary qRT-PCR analysis showed that copy numbers below 3 \u00d7 10 2 gave inconsistent Ct values within the triplicates.

In all the cDNA priming strategies the 0 h samples showed the lowest copy number compared to the 3-day and 6-day samples, indicating specific increase in ISAV transcripts due to virus replication. cDNA generated using the gene specific primer showed an overall highest absolute copy number of the ISAV segment 8 ng \u22121 of total RNA, followed by that of the random hexamer and then the oligo-dT primer (Fig. 1) . The agarose gel electrophoresis of the RT-PCR products showed the expected 220 bp PCR product for the three different priming strategies (data not shown), confirming specificity of the PCR reactions. Each primer has a different way of priming cDNA synthesis from RNA of ISAV-infected TO cell lysates. The oligo-dT primer binds to the poly(A) tails of mRNA to generate first strand cDNA, whereas the gene specific F5/R5 primer anneals specifically to ISAV segment 8 genomic RNA, cRNA or mRNA to generate first strand cDNA. Random hexamers are capable of priming cDNA at many points along the viral RNA, cRNA, or mRNA template as well as cellular RNA templates, generating fragmentary copies of entire populations of RNA molecules (Sambrook and Russel, 2001) .",

The process of mRNA synthesis from the ssRNA genome of ISAV is not well studied. However, influenza A virus which belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family similarly to ISAV has been well studied in this respect. Influenza A virus negative-strand RNA (vRNA) serves as a template for the synthesis both of capped, polyadenylated viral mRNA and of full-length positive-strand RNA or complementary RNA (cRNA) (Cros and Palese, 2003) . The poly(A) tail of influenza virus mRNA is synthesized by reiterative copying of a 5-7 nt long U sequences of 16 nt from the 5 end of the viral RNA template. The cRNA is associated with the same viral proteins as the vRNA and serves as a template for the synthesis of new vRNA molecules, which in turn serve as templates for mRNA and cRNA, particularly early in the infection (Robertson et al., 1981; Fodor and Smith, 2004; Amorim and Digard, 2006) . Even though there is no detailed characterization of molecular replication strategy of ISAV, sequencing of 3 and 5 ends of segments 7 and 8 has revealed that ISAV mRNA is polyadenlyated (Sandvik et al., 2000) .",

It was considered that in vitro transcribed RNA templates would estimate more accurately template amounts in the RNA inputs and therefore give a more accurate quantitation as they would be subjected to the same RT reaction (unlike the pDNA standards for qPCR). For initial calibration, first strand cDNA synthesis used the gene specific F5/R5 primer from 10-fold diluted in vitro transcribed RNA of 10 1 -10 10 copies. The F5/R5 primer showed nonspecific amplification signals in transcribed RNA preparations with \u226410 5 copies. Thus, for comparison of the F5/R5 with the random hexamer priming, in vitro transcribed RNA standards were prepared in serial 5-fold dilutions with copies ranging from 3.2 \u00d7 10 6 to 1 \u00d7 10 9 . The qPCR was carried out under the same conditions as for the pDNA standard curve. The F5/R5 primed cDNA had a higher amplification efficiency (E) of 2.14 compared to that for random hexamers primed cDNA (E = 1.94), which was mainly a result of the lower dilutions of the in vitro transcribed RNA standards, which generated closer Ct values between dilutions. These low template reactions in the F5/R5 primed cDNA were associated with primer-dimers. Oligo-dT priming was not attempted on the in vitro transcribed RNA templates since they were not polyadenylated.",

The F5/R5 showed non-specific primerdimers in reactions using \u226410 5 in vitro transcribed RNA copies whereas the quantitation limit with random hexamer primers was 10 3 in vitro transcribed RNA copies; the standard curves generated with random hexamer primers also had a better PCR efficiency compared to those with the gene specific F5/R5 primers.

            "text": "In order to provide a method for absolute quantitation of ISAV using TaqMan \u00ae probe chemistry, the segment 8 TaqMan \u00ae probebased qRT-PCR assay developed and validated by Snow et al. (2006) was modified for use in a single tube with a one-step RT-PCR kit (Roche) in a 96-well plate in the LC 480 instrument (Roche) with absolute quantitation methods. Preliminary qRT-PCR analysis showed that the in vitro transcribed RNA preparations with \u22652.2 \u00d7 10 11 copies (or \u226515.16 ng/l cRNA) inhibited the RT-PCR, giving Ct values >34.0 whereas for preparations with 2.2 \u00d7 10 10 copies, the Ct value was <5.0 and increased in proportion to the dilution of the in vitro transcribed RNA preparation with a detection limit of 2.2 \u00d7 10 1 in vitro transcribed RNA copies. Based on these observations, serial 10-fold dilutions were prepared, and those in the range from 2.2 \u00d7 10 9 to 2.2 \u00d7 10 2 were used to establish a standard curve for ISAV segment 8 RNA transcripts with 2-5 replicates per dilution point. The standard curve had an amplification efficiency of 1.965 and error of 0.00866. Table 1 summarizes a comparison between the two methods (SYBR \u00ae Green I-based two tube qRT-PCR versus TaqMan \u00ae probe-based single tube one-step qRT-PCR) when applied to RNA extracted from eight serial 10-fold dilutions of virus lysates of NBISA01 and RPC/NB 04-085-1 in terms of their dynamic range Table 1 Comparison of the dynamic range of ISAV segment 8 two tube qRT-PCR with SYBR Green I chemistry and single tube one-step qRT-PCR with TaqMan probe chemistry relative to the virus titres expressed as TCID 50 /ml. Both methods had the same TCID 50 detection limits for NBISA01 and RPC/NB-04-085-1, 10 4.75 TCID 50 /ml and 10 2.75 TCID 50 /ml, respectively. For the same titers of the two isolates the SYBR \u00ae Green I method showed 215-and 81-fold higher copy numbers for NBISA01 and RPC/NB-04-085-1, respectively. The data suggest that there is 100-fold lower detectable virus titer of the low pathogenic ISAV strain RPC/NB-04-085-1, which was accompanied by 3-(in the SYBR \u00ae Green I method) and 8-fold (in the TaqMan \u00ae method) higher copy number of RPC/NB-04-085-1 compared to NBISA01. The difference in the TCID 50 detection limit for the two virus strains is probably related to the fact that qRT-PCR also detects viral RNA in non infectious or defective virus particles which are probably more in the lower pathogenic ISAV. This would imply that the molecular basis for the virulence difference between the two viruses occurs at the post-transcription steps of virus replication, probably resulting in a higher production of non-infectious virus particles by the low pathogenic ISAV strain RPC/NB-04-085-1. While using the same in vitro transcribed RNA standards for quantitation of ISAV RNA copy equivalents in both chemistries, the SYBR \u00ae Green I-based system reported higher RNA copies per ml of virus lysate for the same Ct value in the TaqMan \u00ae probe chemistry (data not shown). The difference can be partly explained by the sequence-specific detection chemistry of the TaqMan probe chemistry (Holland et al., 1991; Lay and Wittwer, 1997) , compared to the non-specific dsDNA binding of SYBR \u00ae Green I fluorophore (Simpson et al., 2000) . Moreover, the SYBR \u00ae Green I method loses reliability in reactions with low templates amounts (Ct values \u226535.0). The inconsistency of SYBR \u00ae Green I readings for low template reactions was previously reported by Walters and Alexander (2004) .",

The standard curve plots of Ct versus log 10 TCID 50 /ml for the SYBR \u00ae Green I and TaqMan chemistries are shown in Fig. 2A and B. Both plots have a linear model fit and have small slope difference between the isolates manifested by the parallel nature of the two lines. Both the SYBR \u00ae Green I and TaqMan reaction linear fits suggest that for a certain Ct value NBISA01 will have higher log 10 TCID 50 compared to the RPC/NB-04-085-1 for the range of dilutions considered. This is consistent with NBISA01 being highly pathogenic (Kibenge et al., 2006) where with lower viral genome copies, it can give a higher titer TCID 50 compared to the less pathogenic RPC/NB-04-085-1. Similarly, using the NBISA01 dilutions that have 5 points on the standard curve, the linear fits generated using the TaqMan \u00ae one tube one-step method were compared with the linear fit generated using the SYBR \u00ae Green I two Fig. 2 .

The linear fits show slight differences in the two methods in that the SYBR \u00ae Green I two tube reactions show a slightly higher Ct value for a specified TCID 50 below 10 7.92 ml \u22121 (the TCID 50 value where the two lines cross). The difference can be explained by the fact that the TaqMan \u00ae probe method involves a single step that uses all the cDNA from the RT-step whereas the SYBR \u00ae Green I method uses 2 l of cDNA generated in 20 l reaction, introducing a 10-fold dilution of the cDNA template. Thus, the slightly lower Ct values of the SYBR \u00ae Green I two tube method are related directly to the template cDNA amounts available for the PCR stage.",
