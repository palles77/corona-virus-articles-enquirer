If secondary bacterial infections are suspected, antibiotic therapy may also be appropriate, but careful consideration should be made when choosing antibiotics for certain antibiotic-sensitive species (eg, guinea pigs). In colony or group-housed settings, viral infections may be very contagious and difficult to eliminate if na\u0131\u00a8ve animals are added or produced through breeding. In these cases, a stop breeding or ''burnout'' program may be effective to eliminate viral infections. In these programs, breeding is stopped and no new additional animals are added (closed colony) for 6 to 8 weeks. This allows infected animals to develop a sufficient immune response to clear infections and ultimately eliminate the virus from the colony. Quarantine of potentially exposed animals and culling of carriers may also be warranted.",

Exophthalmus and chromodacryorrhea result from swelling of the Harderian gland, and unilateral or bilateral glaucoma/ megaloglobus, hyphema, and corneal ulceration can occur secondarily.

The first report describes an adult female chinchilla that presented with a history of acute death. Necrotic foci with inclusion bodies were found in the spleen, pineal body, adrenal glands, and medulla of the brain. Electron microscopy was highly suggestive of a herpeslike viral infection based on morphology of the virus and distribution of lesions. In the second case, a 1-year-old male chinchilla with conjunctivitis, uveitis, and bilateral mydriasis for 2 weeks began to show neurologic signs, including disorientation, seizures, and biting at the cage bars, leading to atonic recumbancy. The chinchilla was treated with antibiotics and electrolytes but was euthanized after 3 weeks because of a poor prognosis. Significant pathologic findings included a unilateral purulent rhinitis, keratouveitis, retinopathy, optical neuritis, nonsuppurative meningitis, and polioencephalitis with neuronal necrosis. Intranuclear inclusion bodies were found in many areas of the brain and the nasal cavity. Electron microscopy, immunohistochemical staining, virus isolation, and nucleic acid sequence analysis confirmed an infection with human herpes simplex virus type 1, a common virus carried by humans causing oral or labial lesions that can lead to encephalitis. The authors proposed a primary ocular infection in the chinchilla potentially from contact to a human with a herpetic lesion that subsequently spread to the central nervous system. Although this route of transmission could not be confirmed, this raises the question of whether chinchillas can serve as reservoirs for herpes simplex virus.",

Transmission of rabies to small mammals is extremely unlikely, because captive-bred animals have minimal exposure to the disease; furthermore, in the wild, when a small mammal comes in contact with a rabies-infected predator, the small mammal is more likely to be consumed than to have the disease transmitted during the encounter.
