The purpose of this article is to provide an overview for imaging some of the more frequently encountered nonneoplastic diseases of the brain. Clinical features of each disease are included because imaging can supplement but never replace a careful history and thorough physical and neurological examination. Typical pathological changes are also mentioned, because CT and MRI reflect gross and microscopic pathology and an understanding of the expected pathological changes can be very helpful in predicting imaging findings. Ideally, a review article such as this would be based on systematic research and clinical data. Unfortunately, the current literature on imaging of nonneoplastic brain disease in veterinary patients is fairly sparse. Therefore, the information presented in this article is based on the limited data regarding veterinary patients supplemented by the much more complete information on comparable diseases in human patients, as well as my own experience. As more information becomes available, the conclusions in this article may have to be modified.",

            "text": "Hydrocephalus is a pathological condition in which there is accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the cranium. 23 This usually occurs within the ventricular system (internal hydrocephalus) but can involve the subarachnoid space (external hydrocephalus)) Hydrocephalus is not a specific disease, but rather a multifactorial disorder with a variety of pathophysiological mechanisms. CSF is produced at a constant rate by the choroid plexuses of the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles; the ependymal lining of the ventricular system; and blood vessels in the subarachnoid space. The CSF circulates through the ventricular system into the subarachnoid space, where it is absorbed by arachnoid villi. 3 Hydrocephalus can be caused by a blockage of the flow of CSE called obstructive hydrocephalus, or secondary to decreased volume of brain parenchyma, termed hydrocephalus ex vacuo. (Increased formation of CSF is virtually never a cause of hydrocephalus.) A number of conditions, such as infarction and necrosis, can result in decreased volume of brain parenchyma and hydrocephalus ex vacuo. Obstruction to CSF flow can occur anywhere along the pathway from its formation to the site of absorption in the cranial and spinal arachnoid villi. Obstruction within the ventricular system or at its outflow through the lateral apertures is called noncommunicating hydrocephalus because the ventricular system does not communicate with the subarachnoid space. Obstruction within the subarachnoid space or at the level of absorption in the arachnoid villi is called communicating hydrocephalus. ~ Hydrocephalus can be classified further as congenital or acquired. Congenital hydrocephalus is most common in toybreed dogs. The causes are diverse and include genetic factors, developmental anomalies, and intrauterine or perinatal infection or bleeding in the brain. Congenital hydrocephalus may be associated with a wide range of other nervous system anomalies, including meningomyelocele, Chiari malformation, Dandy-Walker syndrome, and cerebellar hypoplasia. Clinical signs of congenital hydrocephalus include an enlarged, domeshaped head with persistent fontanelles and open cranial sutures. Neurological deficits include abnormal behavior, disturbed consciousness, ataxia, circhng, blindness, seizures, and vestibular dysfunction. In mature dogs, diseases such as tumors and inflammatory diseases can cause acquired hydrocephalus. Neurological deficits are similar to those m puppms, but if hydrocephalus develops after the cranial sutures have closed, malformation of the skull does not develop. 2, 3 CT and MRI allow accurate assessment of ventricular size, extent of cortical atrophy, and the presence of any focal lesions that may account for the hydrocephalus. Imaging is also useful in monitoring patients after surgical placement of ventriculoperitoneal shunts used for treatment. Changes in ventricular size can be monitored, and the presence of complications such as subdural hematoma or hygroma can be evaluated. 4",

            "text": "Hydrocephalus ex vacuo can be distinguished from obstructive hydrocephalus based on enlarged cortical sulci and subarachnoid space secondary to atrophy of brain parenchyma (Fig 2) . In obstructive hydrocephalus, the site of obstruction may be identified by dilatation of CSF spaces proximal to the obstruction, and normal or collapsed spaces distally. For example, obstruction at the level of the third venmcle would be expected to result in enlarged lateral ventricles but no enlargement of the mesencephalic aqueduct and fourth ventricle (Fig 3) . Dilatation of all the ventricles and the subarachnmd space implies an obstruction at or near the arachnoid vilh. Unfortunately, this simplisuc approach has limited accuracy. For example, 25% to 35% of human patients with communicating hydrocephalus have little or no &latation of the fourth ventricle. 4 Obstructing masses, such as tumors, granulomas, and cysts, may be identified, especially on postcontrast images (Fig 3) . MRI is more sensitive than CT in showing small focal lesions, especially those in the caudal fossa) Periventricular edema may be identified in some patients with hydrocephalus. Experimentally, acute obstructive hydrocephalus in dogs causes edema starting at the dorsolateral angles of the lateral ventricles and spreading into the adjacent white matter, n On CT, this is evident as blurring or loss of the normally sharp ventricular margins. 4 The edema is best appreciated on T2-welghted MRI as increased intensity compared with normal white matter. 1~ Periventrlcular edema is most frequently associated with acute hydrocephalus and increased intraventricular pressure, rather than chronic, relatively compensated hydrocephalus with normal intraventricular pressure. 4",

            "text": "Chiarl described four unrelated types of malformations of the brainstem and cerebellum in human patients. The most common is Chiari I malformation, which consists of caudal displacement of a portion of the cerebellum through the foramen magnum into the cervical portion of the vertebral canal. The cause is an underdeveloped occipital bone that induces overcrowding of the caudal fossa, which is accommodated by caudal displacement of the cerebellum. 12 Many human patients with this malformation develop hydromyelia (a dilatation of the central canal of the spinal cord that is lined by ependyma) and/or syringomyelia (an accumulation of fluid within the spinal cord that is not lined by ependyma). The term syringohydromyefia is often used because it can be &fficult or impossible to tell whether the cavity is lined with ependyma except at necropsy. Syringohydromyelia in Chiarl I malformation is caused by obstruction of CSF flow at the foramen magnum. The brain expands as it fills with blood during systole, inducing a pressure wave in the CSF that is accommodated in normal subjects by rapid movement of CSF from within the skull to the vertebral canal. With obstruction to rapid movement of CSF through the foramen magnum, the caudal portion of the cerebellum moves down- ward with each systolic pulse, acting as a piston on the surface of the spinal cord. This relentless compression of the spinal cord propels CSF into and within the syrinx. 13 Some paUents also have hydrocephalus attributed to obstruction of CSF flow in the crowded caudal fossa. Clinical signs of Chiari I malformation in human beings can develop in childhood or adulthood and include head and neck pain, myelopathy, or encephalopathy. 12, 13 A similar malformation has been reported m adult dogs with neck pain and tetraparesls. 1~a5 Diagnosis is best made on sagittal MRI of the craniocervmal junction (Fig 4) . The caudal portion of the cerebellum is displaced into the vertebral canal to a variable degree3 4, 16 The cerebellomedullary cistern is small or absent and the caudal fossa may appear subjectively overcrowded. Hydrocephalus and syringohydromyelia may be evident. 14-16 Syringohydromyelia often involves the caudal cervical or cranial thoracic segments, so this entire region should be imaged. All patients with syrmgohydromyelia should have imaging of the craniocervical region to rule out a Chiari I malformation or other obstruction of CSF flow. 16 Chiarl II malformation, also known as Arnold-Chiari or Cleland-Chari malformation, involves caudal displacement of the brainstem and cerebellum through an enlarged foramen magnum. The fourth ventricle is elongated and extends caudal to the foramen magnum, and the brainstem may be kinked. 16 Chiari III malformation is displacement of the cerebellum through a cervical spina bifida resulting m a cervmal encephalocele. Chiari II and III malformations are not well described in small animals. Chiari IV malformation is severe cerebellar hypoplasia and is discussed separately.17",

They carl develop in the subarachnold space anywhere along the neuraxis. Congenital arachnoid cysts are developmental anomalies originating from a splitting or duplication of the arachnoid mater. The cyst wall is formed by several layers of arachnoid cells. Acquired arachnoid cysts may result from postinflammatory loculauon of CSF caused by trauma, infection, or hemorrhage. 24 In human beings, congenital intracranial arachnoid cysts may be asymptomatic or cause neurological deficits as the cyst progressively enlarges and compresses adjacent neural structures or interferes with CSF circulation. Enlargement of arachnoid cysts occurs because of fired production by the cyst wall or an anatomical communication functioning as a oneway valve between the cyst and the subarachnoid space. 2~ Intracranial arachnoid cysts have been reported in the dog and cat. z5, 26 The most common locatmn is the subarachnoid space between the cerebellum and the tentorium cerebelli. Clinical signs may occur in immature or mature animals and include smzures, paresis, abnormal behavior, and cranial nerve deficits. In some patients, the cyst is an incidental finding on imaging. 26 On CT, the cyst has well-defined margins and contains fired that is isodense wath CSF (Fig 5) . There is mal, or intraventricular. Epidural, subdural, and subarachnoid hemorrhages are often associated with trauma and are discussed later. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage can be primary or secondary and can extend into the ventricular system. The cause of primary intraparenchymal hemorrhage is incompletely understood. People with this disorder often have systemic hypertension and fibrinoid degeneration of arteries in the b r a i n y Although intracranial hemorrhage caused by hypertension is poorly documented in dogs and cats, primary hypertension and hypertension secondary to other disorders, such as renal disease, hyperadrenocorticism, and hyperthyroidism, are well recognized. 28 These animals may be predisposed to cerebrovascular disease and intracranial hemorrhage. 28 Secondary causes of intracranial hemorrhage include trauma, infarction, congenital vascular malformations, intracranial tumor, vasculitis, and coagulopathies. [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] The clinical signs of intraparenchymal hemorrhage consist of a sudden onset of neurological deficits referable to a focal brain lesion. Signs may progressively worsen as the hematoma expands, compressing adjacent neural structures and increasing intracranial pressure. 30-33 36-39 Computed Tomography CT is exqmsitely sensitive to acute hemorrhage. Because the attenuation of x-rays is primarily attributable to the globin portion of blood, there is a linear relationship between CT attenuation and hematocrit. 4\u00b0 The attenuation of whole blood with a hematocrit of 46% is approximately 56 Hounsfield units (HU). In comparison, normal gray matter has an attenuation of 37 to 41 HU, and normal white matter, 20 to 34 HU. 4\u00b0 Acute hemorrhage in a patient with a normal hematocrit is therefore immediately evident as increased attenuation on CT ( Fig  6) .31,36 Hemorrhage in patients with severe anemia may be less obvious. An acute hematoma may he surrounded by a hypodense region corresponding to edema, and there is often an associated m a s s effect. 31'36 41 The attenuation of extravasated blood increases for the first 72 hours with clot formation and extrusion of low-density serum and subsequent increase in hemoglobin concentration. 4\u00b0 After that, the attenuation gradually decreases as the result of lysis and phagocytosls of erythrocytes, which starts at the periphery and progresses centrally. 4\u00b0~1 The hematoma eventually becomes isodense at about 1 month after onset. 4\u00b0-41",

Factors intrinsic to the lesion that affect images include the age of the hemorrhage, whether the bleeding is arterial or venous, the location of the bleeding, and the presence of any underlying lesions. Operator-dependent factors that affect the images include the mare magnetic field strength, the exact pulse sequence parameters used, and the method of echo formation. 43 Hemorrhage can be thought of as an iron salvage pathway, in which iron from the extravasated erythrocytes is mobilized from hemoglobin and converted to short-term iron-containing proteins for transfer to the reticuloendothelial system, or to long-term storage proteins for local deposition. 44 During this process, oxyhemoglobin is converted in a stepwise fashion to deoxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, and finally ferritin and hemosiderin. These various forms of hemoglobin affect the appearance of hemorrhage in three ways: (1) protein effects that are present with all forms of hemoglobin; (2) paramagnetm relaxation caused by paramagnetic molecules, which is significant only with methemoglobin; and (3) inhomogeneous susceptibility effects induced by paramagnetlc forms of hemoglobin (deoxyhemoglobin and methemoglobm) within erythrocytes. 45, 46 Protein effects. Relaxation times are shortened in the presence of proteins In water solutions. 45 This is caused by the changing magnetic fields of nearby nuclei as the molecules undergo Brownian motion. 45 Protein effects are generally proportional to protein concentrations and result in shortening of T1 and T2; that is, increased intensity on Tl-weighted images and decreased intensity on T2-weighted images, compared with pure water. 45 Paramagnetic effects. Biological substances containing unpaired electrons have magnetic properties dominated by the magnetic effects of these unpaired electrons. The magnetic fields of the unpaired electrons are normally oriented randomly such that there is no net magnetization. However, when an external magnetic field is applied, the unpaired electrons tend to align parallel to that field, resulting in enhancement (increased magmtude) of that applied field. Substances that have no intrinsic magnetic field m the absence of an applied magnetic field, but align with and thus enhance that applied field, are termed paramagnetic. 46 Some forms of hemoglobin contain iron with paramagnetic properties, which greatly affects the MRI appearance.",

This proton-electron dipoledipole interaction shortens relaxation ume of the water protons. For proton relaxation enhancement to occur, however, the water proton must come within about 0.3 nm of the paramagnetic ions' unpaired electrons, because the magnitude of this interaction is inversely proportional to the sixth power of the distance between the dipoles. 46 These paramagnetic effects are more prominent on Tl-weighted images than on T2-weighted images. 43 They will therefore result in an increased signal on Tl-weighted images, similar to the effects of gadolinium-based contrast agents. (Paramagnetism of MRI contrast medium is also discussed in the Tidwell & Jones article in the May 1999 issue.) Inhomogeneous susceptibility effects. When paramagnetlsm is confined to a small region (such as within erythrocytes), there is an inhomogeneous distribution of paramagnetic susceptibility that creates microscopic field gradients. 45 Water molecules diffusing across the erythrocyte membrane experience a fluctuating magnetic field that results in dephasing and shortened T2 relaxation, a process called inhomogeneous susceptiblhty effect. In spin-echo sequences, inhomogeneous susceptibihty effects result in signal loss because of shortened T2 relaxation. This leads to decreased intensity on T2-weighted images. 46 Hematoma evolution. These three relaxation mechanisms along with proton density contribute to image contrast during the various stages of hematoma formation (Table 1) . Because numerous factors can effect the appearance of intracranial hemorrhage on MRI, the following summary is necessarily oversimplified but generally applicable to spin-echo sequences at 0.5 to 2.0 T. (Refer to the Tidwell &Jones article in the May 1999 issue for a discussion on gradient echo imaging of hemorrhage.) Furthermore, the timing of various stages may vary significantly, and different stages often overlap. 43, 45 The precise dating of specific hematomas is notoriously inaccurate, so the nomenclature of the temporal stages of hematomas is somewhat arbitrary. 43",

Deoxygenation is usually complete by 24 hours. 45 Removal of molecular oxygen changes the distribution of electrons in the ferrous ion, leaving four unpaired electrons in the outer shell. These unpaired electrons confer deoxyhemoglobin with paramagnetic properties. The paramagnetic iron of deoxyhemoglobm is contained within a hydrophobic crevice in the hemoglobin mdlecule. This prevents water from coming close enough to the paramagnetic ion to induce paramagnetic (dipole-dipole) interaction, Thus, the hematoma is still isointense to slightly hypointense on T 1-weighted images. 43 As long as the erythrocyte membrane is intact, the paramagneuc deoxyhemoglobln is localized within the cell. This results in inhomogeneous suscepub]lity effects# 3 Acute hematomas that contain intracellular deoxyhemoglobin consequently appear very hypointense on T2-we]ghted images. 43 At this stage, any surrounding edema appears as a hyperintense perimeter on T2-weighted images) 3 Intracellular methemoglobin. As oxygen tension within the hematoma falls further, deoxyhemoglobin is oxidized to methemoglobin (subacute hematoma). In whole blood, methemoglobin begins to accumulate at the rate of about 10% per day, after the first 2 days. 4s Conversion to methemoglobin is maximal when the P02 is approximately 20 mm Hg. If the oxygen tension is higher or lower, conversion to methemoglobin is slowed, affecting MRI contrast. 46 The iron in methemoglobin is in the ferric (Fe +3) state, which has five unpaired electrons in ItS outer shell and is highly paramagnetic. Also, one of the coordination sites of the methemoglobln molecule is occupied by a water molecule that is rapidly exchanged with other water molecules in solution. As a result, water is positioned within 0.3 nm of the paramagnetic iron. This allows paramagnetic (dipole-dipole) interaction to shorten T1 relaxation, causing methemoglobin to be hyperintense on Tl-weighted images. This hyperintensity begins at the periphery of an intraparenchyreal hematoma and progresses inward, probably because the outer rim of the hematoma has the optimal oxygen tension for the oxidation of hemoglobin. 43,45 At this stage the hematoma is still hypointense on T2-welghted images23 Other causes of T1 hyperintensity or T2 hypointenslty include fat, calcification, mucinous material, intratumoral melanin, flow effects, and enhancement with paramagnetic contrast agents23 Extracellular methemoglobin. Soon after methemoglobin formation begins, glucose reserves in the erythrocytes are depleted and hemolysis ensues. This eliminates the inhomogeneous susceptibility effect as the methemoglobin becomes uniformly distributed. This prolongs T2, and the hematoma is once again hyperintense on T2-weighted images (rebound hyperintensity). 45 On the other hand, Tl-weighted images are not affected and therefore continue to show hyperintensity. 45 This paradoxical state of T1 and T2 hyperintensity may persist for 1 month or more (Fig 7) . 45 Ferritin and hemosiderin. After 2 to 6 weeks, modified macrophages (gitter cells) infiltrate from surrounding brain and remove iron from the hematoma (chronic hematoma). This eventually eliminates the remaining protein and inhomogeneous susceptibility effects. The center of the hematoma eventually either collapses or is replaced by CSE 45 The iron is deposited at the periphery of the hematoma as hemosiderin and ferritin, which behave paramagnetically. 43 The iron in these storage forms is not accessible to water, so paramagnetic (dipole-dipole) interaction does not occur, but the inhomogeneous susceptibility effect shortens T2. A chronic hematoma has a rim that is hypointense on Tl-weighted images and very hypointense on T2-weighted images. The rim becomes thicker as the hematoma resolves. 45 ",

However, the failure to identify large vessels does not entirely exclude a vascular malformation, because compression or obliteration of vessels by adjacent hematoma, extremely slow flow, and thrombosis may obscure the abnormal vessels. 51,52 Although CT and MRI are useful in detecting hemorrhage associated with vascular malformations and depicting the vascular anatomy of some of these lesions, catheter angiography or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is often necessary for complete assessment of cerebrovascular malformations m human patients. 51,52,~4 (Refer to the Tidwell & Jones article in the May 1999 issue for a discussion of MRA.)",

A necrotizing form of encephalitis has been recognized in pug dogs, Maltese terriers, and Yorkshire terriers between 6 months and 10 years of age. n2-n6 Signs include progressive seizures, abnormal behavior, blindness, ataxia, and walking in circles. Pathological changes consist of multifocal necrosis and nonsuppuratlve inflammation, with a striking predilection for the white matter of the cerebrum.

In Yorkshire terriers, the brainstem may be preferentially revolved. 113 The etiology is unknown. In acute forms of the disease, CT may show one or more focal hypodense lesions, most commonly affecting the cerebral hemisphere. The lesions may or may not enhance with contrast agent. MRI shows the early edematous changes as increased signal intensity on proton density-weighted and T2-weighted images and decreased signal intensity on Tl-weighted images. In acute cases, there is often substantial mass effect and minimal if any abnormal enhancement with contrast medium (Fig 17) . Differentials include neoplasia, other inflammatory lesions, and acute infarction.",

Because of relatively poor vascularization of white matter, the medial aspect of the capsule may be somewhat thinner. This predisposes to expansion of the abscess into white matter, the formation of daughter abscesses medially, or rupture into the lateral ventricles, lz9,13\u00b0,132 The capsule is visible on unenhanced CT as an isodense rim that is visible because it is bordered medially by a hypodense liquid center and surrounded by hypodense edema (Fig 21) . 131 The edema may be greater in volume than the abscess itself, causing much of the mass effect. 131 On contrast-enhanced CT, the rim is usually smooth and brightly enhancing. There is no diffusion of contrast into the necrotic center on delayed scans as there is with cerebritis, n9-131 On Tl-weighted MRI there is mild peripheral hypointensity representing edema and a more markedly hypointense liquid center. The capsule is a discrete rim that is isointense to slightly hyperintense. On T2-weighted images the abscess center is isointense to mildly hyperintense to gray matter.
