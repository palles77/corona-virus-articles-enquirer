In 155/220 (70.5%) of the patients, as compared to 26/128 (20.3%) of the controls (p <0.001), at least one microorganism was found. Group A streptococci, F. necrophorum, and influenza B virus were the three most common findings, and all significantly more common in patients than in controls (p <0.001, p 0.001, and p 0.002, respectively). Patients with F. necrophorum only (n = 14) displayed a lower Centor score than patients with Group A streptococcus only (n = 46), but a higher score than patients with influenza B, other viruses, or no potential pathogen (Kruskal-Wallis p <0.001). A pathogen was detected in 70% of the patients, displaying a wide range of pathogens contributing to the aetiology of pharyngotonsillitis.

However, the methods for sampling and analyses of the samples used here are the same that may be used in the clinical setting and thus relevant. Non-infectious causes of sore throat have also been reported by other authors [23] , but were not included in this study. Interestingly, the median Centor score in the group of patients with no bacterium or virus found (Centor score 2) were similar to the group with viruses found, indicating that there may be more infections due to viruses rather than bacteria being undetected in this group. As expected, GAS was the most common pathogen [24] . The Centor score for these patients was higher than for patients with non-GAS infections, supporting the continuous use of this score to predict the presence of GAS [5] . There was a large diversity of the viruses contributing to the aetiology, and the temporal variation resulted in influenza B (only period 1) being the most common viral cause of pharyngotonsillitis in this age group. Respiratory viruses were also detected in the control group. This might be seen as over-reporting of the presence of these viruses due to the high sensitivity of PCR. However, we would argue, rather, that it reflects asymptomatic infections or prolonged shedding of viruses. Despite the unbiased inclusion, as many as 15% of the patients were culturepositive for F. necrophorum, while only 3% of the healthy controls were positive for this bacterium. Previously, Aliyu et al. described patients, aged 5 months to 79 years, with a sore throat where a routine culture was obtained, and found F. necrophorum in 10% of these samples using PCR, but did not find any F. necrophorum among 100 healthy controls [12] .",

Fusobacterium necrophorum was the only microorganism found in 14 patients. These patients were not necessarily less ill than the patients with GAS only, but received a lower Centor score due to a higher presence of cough. Although the power of the study was not calculated to rule out associations between signs and symptoms, this study could not find any association between age [14] , recent primary EBV infection [25] , or recurrent sore throat [26] and the detection of F. necrophorum, as suggested by others. However, smoking and coating of the tonsils increased the likelihood of detecting F. necrophorum. Importantly, some of the controls were positive for F. necrophorum, and the presence of this bacterium is thus not strictly associated with symptoms. Among nearly twothirds of patients with a presence of F. necrophorum, another microorganism was found (both GAS and viruses). The growth, and possibly also the pathogenic potential of F. necrophorum, may thus be facilitated by an underlying inflammation.",

            "text": "In conclusion, this study showed that GAS and several respiratory viruses, together with F. necrophorum, are of importance in the aetiology of pharyngotonsillitis. The exact distribution of each specific pathogen will, at a given time, be subjected to local and temporal variations. Both Centor and Bank et al. have suggested that a broad antibiotic treatment of tonsillitis could prevent the few cases of severe infection (i.e. Lemi\u00e8rre syndrome) [27, 28] . We consider this suggestion premature, as the finding of F. necrophorum in a predisposing tonsillitis has not been shown to be of importance for the development of Lemi\u00e8rre syndrome, and as the best treatment option of F. necrophorum has not yet been established. More studies are warranted to further define the importance of F. necrophorum in tonsillitis, establish a standard for how to handle the finding of F. necrophorum in pharyngotonsillitis, and determine whether antibiotic treatment is needed. We urge diagnostic laboratories to consider the methods needed to find this bacterium in throat swabs (i.e. PCR-based methodology or anaerobic culture for 4 days) [13] .",
