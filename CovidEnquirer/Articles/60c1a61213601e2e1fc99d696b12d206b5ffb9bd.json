In 2014, influenza and pneumonia accounted for 2.3% of deaths among adults 65 years or older in the United States. 1 Older adults, especially those older than 75 years of age, experience the highest rate of influenza-associated mortality rate among all age groups. 2 The availability of rapid diagnostic tests, antiviral medications, and, most notably, the seasonal influenza vaccine mitigate some of influenza's devastating effects. 3 Respiratory viruses other than influenza also cause significant morbidity and mortality among older adults, particularly those who are residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs). 4, 5 These viruses include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, and adenovirus. In this article, we review viruses, other than influenza, that are common causes of respiratory infections in older adults and discuss relevant diagnostic tests, transmission, and infection prevention and control measures.",

Although comprehensive, the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System data do not include patient demographics and therefore do not specifically provide information about the epidemiology of respiratory viruses in older adults or LTCFs. Additionally, other than to rule out influenza, for which there is effective antiviral therapy, molecular diagnostic tests are not yet widely used in the evaluation of older adults or LTCF residents with respiratory infections. Accordingly, most of our understanding of the epidemiology of noninfluenza respiratory infections among older adults is informed through research studies and descriptions of outbreaks in LTCFs ( Table 1) .",

            "text": "Among older adults, RSV causes morbidity and mortality that rivals that of influenza. Falsey and colleagues 9 described RSV infections among older adults over 4 consecutive winters from 1999 to 2003. Among older adults hospitalized with a respiratory viral infection (n 5 1388; age 75 AE 12 years), the authors detected roughly similar proportions of RSV and influenza (142 and 170 cases, respectively). Furthermore, they also found that people with RSV and influenza had similar rates of intensive care stays (15% vs 12%) and mortality (8% vs 7%), respectively. Among this communitydwelling population, for whom the prevalence of vaccination against influenza and Streptococcus pneumoniae was greater than 75%, the incidence of RSV was similar to that for nonpandemic influenza. 94 1980 Data not given United Kingdom Seventeen of 40 residents aged 69-90 y developed fever, anorexia and a nonproductive cough. Paired sera from 2 cases showed an increase in RSV complement fixation titers from <20-160. One resident died after severe chest infection. Sorvillo et al, 10 1984 The rates of RSV infections and death parallel that of influenza among LTCF residents as well. An LTCF in California reported a 6-week outbreak of RSV in 1979 with an attack rate of 40% and a case fatality rate of 20%. 10 Among 381 nursing homes in Tennessee, during 4 consecutive years (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) , RSV contributed to an average of 15 hospitalizations, 76 antibiotic courses, and 17 deaths per 1000 persons each year. 11 In comparison, influenza caused an average of 28 hospitalizations, 147 antibiotic courses, and 15 deaths per 1000 persons each year. In 2008, active surveillance for symptomatic and asymptomatic respiratory viral infections detected an RSV outbreak in a 56-room, 120-bed LTCF in North Carolina. 12 Among 52 residents, 22 (42%) developed respiratory tract infections and, of those, 7 (32%) had an RSV infection confirmed using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). One resident required hospitalization and subsequently died. This study in particular is notable for using RT-PCR to support timely and accurate recognition of an RSV outbreak.",

Unfortunately, clinical manifestations do not permit identification of specific viral pathogens, including RSV. 5, 13 In a prospective study, Walsh and colleagues 13 assessed the clinical characteristics of older adults living in the community or retirement homes who were admitted to the hospital with an acute respiratory illness. Using culture, RT-PCR, serologic analysis, or a combination of these tests, they identified 132 patients with RSV infection and 144 with influenza A virus. They reported that RSV, compared with influenza A, was more commonly associated with nasal congestion (68% vs 55%; P 5 .03), lower temperature at admission (37.7 C vs 38.1 C; P 5 .004) and wheezing by history (73% vs 53%; P 5 .002) or on physical examination (82% vs 68%; P 5 .02). Although these factors were independent predictors for RSV infection persons, none were sufficiently sensitive or specific to accurately discriminate between illnesses caused by RSV versus influenza. Among RSV-infected adults, disease severity correlates with increased levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and viral shedding. IL-6 is a proinflammatory cytokine associated with physical function decline and chronic disease. 14 A study of RSV-infected adults showed that hospitalized patients, compared with outpatients, had greater nasal IL-6 levels and shed RSV longer (13.1 AE 6.3 days vs 9.8 AE 4.8 days, respectively). 15 Furthermore, hospitalized adults who required mechanical ventilation for RSVrelated respiratory failure manifested higher peak RSV viral loads compared with those who did not (log 10 3.7 AE 1.7 PFUs/mL vs log 10 2.4 AE 1.1 PFUs/mL, respectively; P 5 .02). 16 Similarly, among adults hospitalized with PCR-confirmed RSV infections (n 5 123; age 78 AE 15 years), increasing concentrations of viral RNA were associated with respiratory insufficiency and risk of complications (adjusted odds ratio 1.40 per increase in log 10 copies/mL, 95% CI, 1.03-1.90; P 5 .034). 17 Together, these studies indicate that high RSV viral loads correlate with disease severity.",

Older adults with lower serum RSV neutralizing antibodies are more likely to become infected with RSV and to require hospital admission. A prospective study of adults enrolled in day care programs compared serum anti-RSV antibody titers between an infected subgroup (n 5 22) and controls matched for age, exposure, and recent respiratory illness. 18 The mean titers of neutralizing antibodies against RSV were significantly lower in RSV-infected patients compared with controls for both group A (12.4 AE 2.2 vs 14.2 AE 2.2, P 5 .008, respectively) and group B virus (9.1 AE 2.1, vs 10.3 AE 1.5, P 5 .01, respectively). A similar study evaluated antibody titers among a prospective cohort of adults with RSV infection (n 5 130), 61 of whom were hospitalized for RSV. 19 Multivariate analysis showed an increased risk for hospitalization (odds ratio, 5.89; 95% CI, 1.69-20.57; P 5 .04) among adults with low serum anti-RSV antibody levels, defined as less than a 1:100 dilution. After infection, RSV-specific antibodies provide some protection from reinfection, but levels usually decrease within months. A study evaluating 20 adults reported an 8-fold increase in RSV antibody titers after RSV infection. Within 1 year, however, the RSV antibody titers decreased by at least 4-fold in 15 of the adults studied (75%). 20 Because immunity is not complete after preceding infections, reinfection can occur throughout life. 21 ",

Like RSV, HMPV is a member of the Paramyxoviridae family and is divided into genotypes A and B, each of which includes subtypes. Given the variety of genotypes, a seasonal shift of predominant genotype can occur each year, similar to influenza virus. 22 Epidemiology A prospective study in Tennessee found similar rates of infection by HMPV and influenza among hospitalized adults. 4 Over 3 consecutive winters, Widmer and colleagues 4 enrolled 508 individuals 50 years and older, more than 90% of whom lived in the community, who were hospitalized with respiratory symptoms or nonlocalizing fever. RT-PCR testing on nasal swabs detected HMPV in 4.5% (23/508) and influenza virus in 6.5% (33/508) of hospitalized individuals. Patients with HMPV, compared with those with laboratory-confirmed influenza, were older (median age, 76.2 vs 60.0), had more cardiovascular disease (78.3% vs 51.5%), and were more likely to have received the influenza vaccination (87.0% vs 51.5%). Notably, they were also less likely to report a fever (51.2% vs 87.9%).",

            "text": "A single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus, the human rhinovirus (HRV) accounts for 30% to 50% of common colds each year. 41 There are more than 100 serotypes of HRV, which is divided into 3 genotypes, A, B, and C; the severity of illness does not seem to be associated with a particular genotype. 42 In temperate climates, HRV circulates year round and are more likely to cause illness in the warmer months; infections caused by influenza and RSV predominate in the winter months. 41 HRV causes respiratory infections in every age group, and recurrent infection can occur throughout life. 43 Epidemiology Rhinovirus infection is one of the most common noninfluenza respiratory viruses in older adults. A prospective study in the Netherlands evaluated community-dwelling older adults with acute respiratory symptoms for viral infections. 44 PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs or serology detected rhinovirus in 32% of cases (34/107), followed by coronavirus 17% (18/107) and influenza A 5% (5/107). Among symptom-free controls, these rates were 2% (2/91), 2% (2/91), and 0% (0/91), respectively. A similar prospective surveillance study in England found similar results with rhinovirus identified in 24% of respiratory infections (121/497) in adults aged 60 to 90 years. 45 Coronavirus (12%; 59/497) and influenza A or B (3%; 17/497) were the next most common pathogens. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that current smoking (odds ratio, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.14-1.90) and chronic medical conditions (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.17-1.68) were independently associated with lower respiratory complications. Chronic medical conditions included regular treatment for heart disease, respiratory illness, or another high-risk condition designated by the Department of Health. Similarly, a prospective study in Italy assessed people over 65 years of age who presented to the emergency department with a fever and a respiratory illness in February and March of 2009 and 2010. 46 50 Molecular-based methods implicated HRV as the cause of 59% of the outbreaks (174/297). The next most prevalent virus was influenza A, which cased 7.0% of the outbreaks (22/297).",

In Rochester, New York, adults who developed an acute respiratory illness in the winter months from 1999 to 2003 underwent surveillance with RT-PCR and serologic studies. The adults included 4 cohorts: healthy older adults (n 5 611; age 75 AE 6 years), highrisk adults with underlying cardiopulmonary disease (n 5 511; age 70 AE 11 years), healthy young adults (n 5 291; age 33 AE 5 years), and a hospitalized group (n 5 1388; age 75 AE 12 years). During the study period, testing identified 398 HCoV infections from all cohorts, 214 of which (54%) were symptomatic. Of those, 10% (21/214) of them had evidence of viral coinfection. Manifestations of HCoV infection among prospective cohorts excluding the hospitalized group were congestion (98%-100%), constitutional symptoms (53%-74%), and cough (40%-79%). Fever was not common; the mean temperature ranged 36.4 C to 36.8 C. Asymptomatic infection, defined as a 4-fold or greater increase in HCoV-specific serum IgG in the absence of respiratory symptoms, was common, ranging from 33% to 44% in prospective cohorts. Among 71 HCoV infections in the hospitalized group, 23 (32.3%) had infiltrate on chest radiography and 3 (4.2%) died.

Although useful for epidemiologic research, serologic testing is not practical for clinical care. Rapid antigen tests have an advantage of quick results, but are limited in their usefulness owing to poor sensitivity and specificity. When clinical suspicion of a disease is high, negative tests should be confirmed with another testing method. 70 Viral cultures are neither sensitive nor timely in their outcomes, rendering these unhelpful in clinical practice. Some laboratories may offer enzyme immunoassay testing. For most respiratory viruses, these also lack sensitivity. 38 The US Food and Drug Administration has approved several nucleic acid amplification tests for clinical use, with tests for influenza representing the most commonly used single virus assay. Multiplex panels use PCR to test for several respiratory viruses at once, a practical strategy because clinical manifestations do not permit the identification of specific viral pathogens. The number of respiratory viruses tested, sensitivity, and specificity in detection of each virus are different depending on which multiplex PCR test is used. 71 Other than for influenza, the lack of effective antiviral medications combined with the costs associated with nucleic acid amplification test make routine use of these studies impractical for most clinical settings. A potential benefit to more routine use of nucleic acid amplification tests for acute respiratory infections, however, may be the early detection of viral outbreaks in LTCFs through active surveillance, which may confer further benefits by reducing unnecessary antibiotic use. 12 The Infectious Diseases Society of America endorsed this approach in their 2008 clinical practice guidelines addressing fever and infection in LTCF residents. 72 Finally, identification of viral pathogens among older adults with community-acquired pneumonia may support decisions to stop antibiotics and thus support antibiotic stewardship practices. 73 ",

We focus here on applying these principles to residents of LTCFs. 75 Transmission People may become infected with respiratory viruses through direct contact (person to person), indirect contact (via fomites), and droplets containing respiratory secretions. Direct physical contact with an infected person is the most common, efficient, and important form of noninfluenza respiratory virus transmission. 76 Indirect contact occurs via exposure to viable viral particles on fomites contaminated by infected individuals. Finally, susceptible individuals may breathe in droplets of respiratory secretions from an infected person who sneezes or coughs. The CDC defines droplets as respiratory secretions larger than 5 mm and advises using a surgical mask to prevent exposure. 77 Gralton and colleagues 78 evaluated the size of particles produced by 12 adults and 41 children with symptomatic respiratory infections. They reported that with breathing or coughing, 80% of the participants produced airborne particles less than 5 mm in diameter that contained viral RNA. These findings, and those of other investigators, 79,80 support consideration of airborne precautions for outbreaks with severe respiratory viral illnesses, including influenza. However, association with clinical outcomes is still lacking. In addition, airborne precautions are not possible outside of hospital settings and thus are not currently recommended.",

Notably, they call for the use of personal protective equipment, including gowns, gloves, and a mask, for entry into rooms of people on droplet precautions. They also introduced respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette, asking symptomatic people to cover their mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing, to use tissues and dispose of them in no-touch receptacles, to perform hand hygiene after soiling of hands with respiratory secretions, and to wear a surgical mask if tolerated or maintain spatial separation of at least 3 feet when possible. Although not specifically mentioned in the 2007 CDC guidelines, social distancing also reduces the risk of respiratory virus transmission.

            "text": "Guidelines addressing infection control among health care personnel recognize that staff may transmit respiratory viral infections to others and indicate that people with acute viral respiratory infections should not care for high-risk individuals, particularly during community outbreaks of influenza and RSV. 85 The same document also acknowledges that restriction of infected health care personnel from all patient care duties may not be possible because large numbers of personnel may have viral respiratory illnesses during the winter. A prospective study of health care workers at a tertiary care children's hospital detected respiratory virus in 16.7% of nasal swabs collected from asymptomatic individuals during influenza season (November through April). 86 Perhaps of greater concern was that 46% of the subjects reported working while ill with an influenza-like illness. Although these findings may be representative of people working in long-term care, several of the descriptions of noninfluenza viral outbreaks in LTCFs suggest strong parallels. Accordingly, employers might consider strategies to help health care workers with respiratory illnesses minimize their contact with LTCF residents as part of resident safety. When this is not possible, cohorting sick staff and residents may help augment infection control efforts. 87 Treatment Unlike influenza, which may be treated with specific and effective antiviral agents, supportive care remains the mainstay of management for older adults with respiratory illnesses caused by the viruses discussed. Supportive care is an active process that includes frequent monitoring until the patient's clinical status improves. 88 Additional features of supportive care for people with respiratory viral infections include hydration, treatment of fever with acetaminophen, albuterol, supplemental oxygen, and perhaps nebulized saline. Viral infections may precede or occur concurrently with bacterial pneumonia. When concomitant or secondary bacterial lower respiratory infection is suspected in patients with respiratory viral infection, empirical antibiotics should be used. Falsey and colleagues 89 investigated 771 adults hospitalized with respiratory illness, finding that 348 (41%) had a viral infection and, of those, 136 (39%) had evidence of bacterial coinfection, as assessed using procalcitonin and specific bacterial tests. Ideally, among older adults in whom a viral pneumonia is suspected, procalcitonin results that confirm the absence of a bacterial infection should help clinicians to stop antibiotics. A recent systematic review concluded that using procalcitonin to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with acute respiratory infections reduced antibiotic consumption and was not associated with higher mortality rates or treatment failure. 90 Procalcitonin is not yet available as a point-of-care test and is, therefore, still relegated primarily for use in research and acute care settings.",

Molecular testing improves detection for bacterial and viral pathogens, but the implications of test results for clinical care are not yet clear. Gadsby and colleagues 92 collected sputum (96%) and endotracheal aspirates (4%) from 323 adults hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia. Based on multiplex PCR, they detected viruses in 30% of patients (98/323), with 82% of viruses (80/98) codetected with bacteria.
