This, in spite of an overall surplus of low-fat milk, is due to the remarkable spread of the Friesian (Holstein) breed. Much of this excess is processed into skim milk powder, which in the end has to be sold at low prices to countries outside the E.E.C.",

So far, there appears to have been scant heed paid to this advice. With the coming into force of the E.E.C.'s system of payment for milk quality based upon total solids content, it becomes very important to see that feeding and management are of the right order to permit the cow, especially if she is a Friesian, to express her full genetic potential.",

Such early-mated heifers are likely to have a higher than normal incidence of calving difficulties, followed almost certainly by a low level of milk production. It is thought that this is, at least in part, due to the excessive quantity of inter-lobular fat laid down in the udder as a result of abnormally high energy intake. Subsequent lactations of these cows show greater variation than normally occurs. If illness or under-feeding delays the beginning of ovarian activity, making first calving later than usual, there is a varying degree of loss of income.

It is also a matter of the greatest importance in the raising of calves that the quality of the skim milk powder that makes up 60 per cent of most milk replacers, is manufactured by the low-heat spray process, designed to avoid denaturing the milk proteins. When cheaper milk powder with damaged protein is used, hard and larger clots are formed in the calf s stomach. Careful mixing of the replacer powder with water and, if twice-daily bucket feeding is used, giving the milk at 41 \u00b0C, along with strict hygiene, will all help to avoid digestive upsets.",

It is at this time that they are likely to pick up from the pasture high levels of infective larvae of various pathogenic intestinal worms.

Further advantage inherent in autumn calving for the production of replace ment heifers resides in the fact that they will reach the usual mating age of 15 months near the beginning of what is regarded as the Artificial Insemination Centre's mating season, so to calve for the first time in the autumn of the following year.",

She has to convert the greater part of the energy contained in the food eaten into milk during a lactation of 305 days. The peak of her lactation curve occurs at 6-8 weeks after calving and during the early part of these 45-56 days, she has a lowered appetite and an increasing milk demand. She will be unable to absorb enough energy to produce to her genetic capacity and at the same time maintain her weight. This weight loss must be kept to a minimum, and for the average Friesian a total reduction of 25 kg is regarded as tolerable. The important thing is to see that the intake of metabolizable energy is sufficient during the later months of declining lactation to make up the lost weight.",

This is partly because of the lack of time available to the stockman, especially during winter when cows are inside and have to be wholly fed and much more cleaning done in the standings. Periods of patient observation morning and evening are likely to be much reduced. Young cows, after their first calving, especially if they are mixed with older cows, have a low position in the social order and may experience 'silent heat', showing tran sient or no outward signs of oestrus. Because of difficulties in getting enough time at the feeding trough, their weight loss to peak production may be excessive. 2. \u039f\u03bd\u03b1\u03ae\u03b1\u03b7 dysfunction takes two forms. There may be a persistent corpus luteum producing progesterone to stop normal cycling. This may well be the sequel to an endometritis immediately following calving, or there may be follicular cysts, sometimes associated with high oestrogen secretion that shows as a varying degree of nymphomania. 3. Inadequate nutrition may be the cause of delayed conception because it has been shown that cows losing much weight during the period to peak yield are shy breeders. This, then, is another important reason, in addition to preventing ketosis, that the feeding of a high quality concentrate mixture along with the best forage available, should be started at a low level towards the end of the previous lactation, carried through the dry period, increasing steadily as calving approaches (the old 'steamingup' period) and on into the vital first part of lactation. The newly calved cow's appetite is reduced by perhaps 25 per cent, so the required energy level can only be attained by offering enough of a palatable high density concentrate.",

They have been bred to convert food energy and protein into eggs and meat at a high level of efficiency. An interference with their rapid growth at the chick or rearer stage is likely to lead to serious financial loss. This means that there should be continuous moni toring of the environment to see that the temperature is kept as close to the optimum for the age of bird as possible, and that the ingredients of the ration are of high quality, as well as in constant and correct proportion. In general, ad lib feeding is practised. The ready availability of ample supplies of pure water has been emphasized.",

This must be adminis tered immediately following hatching and has now greatly diminished the incidence of this disease.",

Where the disease is enzootic the vaccine must be given one way or another -intraocularly, parenterally, in the drink ing water or as an aerosol spray -on a number of occasions, depending upon the time and severity of the previous outbreak and level of immunity in the parent stock. With young birds, for example, in broilers the first vaccination of an inactivated strain may be at 7 days, 14 days or even 3 weeks, with a second dose given 3 weeks later. Laying birds are vaccinated four times, twice as above, then the third at 6 weeks and the fourth at 16 weeks. For additional protection, they may be given a live vaccine in the drinking water or as a spray every 3-4 months.",

First, all litter must be removed and the interior scrubbed down with brushes or high pressure hose, with subsequent application of an effective disinfectant.
