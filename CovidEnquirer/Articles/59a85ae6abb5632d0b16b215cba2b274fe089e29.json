On the other hand, Tourism Concern is a not-for-profit organization and exists to encourage ethical and sustainable tourism. Organizations run by government were traditionally set up to provide services such as parks, museums and swimming pools that were desirable but not commercially profitable.

So unlike with bank loans a company is not saddled with the need to make payments if it is going through an unprofitable period. Shareholders are attracted to shares by the prospect of dividend payments (related to the level of company profits) as well as growth in the capital value of shares. Of course, there is some risk as there is no guarantee of dividend payments and the value of shares can go down as well as up, indeed the value of shares in failing companies will often become worthless.",

            "text": "Debentures can be seen as a form of loan as they carry a fixed rate of interest. Thus to the company they pose a problem when profits are low because they still have to pay out the fixed interest, but their fixed interest rate is attractive when profits are high as the company will retain more of its profits. Debenture holders get a guaranteed rate of return and are paid before shareholders so they are generally less risky than shares. On the other hand, there is no opportunity to benefit from higher dividends when a company is growing and making good profits. Table 2 .1 illustrates many of the aspects of financing mentioned earlier through the case of Eurotunnel. Eurotunnel is the name given to the rail tunnel that was built between England and France in the 1990s. Of course, a massive amount of capital was required to finance this project. Several points emerge from Table 2 .1 which illustrates the financing of Eurotunnel. First, Eurotunnel's capital represents a mixture of loans from banks which carry interest payments until they are repaid, and share issues which will not pay dividends until profits are earned. If profits from the tunnel are insufficient to repay loans and interest, the company may be forced into liquidation by the banks. The assets of the company would then be sold to repay the banks. Under this scenario, shareholders would get nothing. This is because shareholders are assigned a lower priority than loan providers. However, because their liability is limited, neither would they stand to lose any personal assets, just the value of their shares. Under a more optimistic, high-profit scenario, payments to the banks are limited to previously negotiated rates, leaving substantial profits to be distributed in the form of high dividends to shareholders. Second, three different forms of share issue are illustrated by this case: l A placing in 1986: This is where Eurotunnel's shares were placed directly with institutions such as pension funds and insurance companies. This represents a direct negotiation between the merchant bank selling the shares and the target groups they wish to sell to. ",

For example, Exhibit 2.5 illustrates the objectives of 'The Walt Disney Company' where it can be seen that maximizing long-term shareholder value is a prime concern. The private sector consists of both small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and large corporations. These have previously been classified as sole proprietors and partnerships and limited liability corporations. Understanding small-business organizations is straightforward. The owner is the manager and this can act as a strong incentive to maximize profits. However, it may also mean that profit maximization is subject to personal considerations such as environmental concerns or hours worked. Indeed, the term 'Lifestyle Entrepreneur' has been used to describe small-business owners who construct a business around a hobby that enables them to earn an income whilst pursuing their interest. For corporations, size of operations and number of shareholders make the picture more complex. Companies are run along standard lines: the managing director is responsible for directing managers in the day-to-day running of the organization. The board of directors is responsible for determining company policy and for reporting annually to the shareholders. This can lead to a division between ownership (shareholders) and control (managers) and a potential conflict of interests. Shareholders generally wish to see their dividends and capital gains, and thus company profits, maximized. Managers will generally have this as an important objective since they are ultimately answerable to shareholders. However, they may seek other",

He particularly pointed to the 'onerous obligations' which included the duty of appointing and working with outside directors. He also felt that he had lost the ability to make quick decisions: 'Our business was not one that could be boxed into a rigid timetable of meetings. We had to make decisions quickly, off-the-cuff: if we had to wait 4 weeks for the next board meeting before authorizing Simon to sign UB40, then we would probably lose them altogether'. Branson found the British tradition of paying a large dividend difficult to fit with his business philosophy which was to reinvest profits to increase the company's value and stated that the one year when Virgin was quoted on the stock exchange was the company's least creative year because the executives were taken away from management and strategy by the need to explain their business to fund managers and financial advisers.",
