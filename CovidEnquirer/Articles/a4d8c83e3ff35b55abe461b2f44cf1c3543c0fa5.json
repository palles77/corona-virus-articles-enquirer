            "text": "Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is the major cause of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Systemic steroid treatment represents the first-line therapy for aGVHD and is associated with a response rate of 30% to 60%. Steroid-resistant patients have a poor prognosis with high transplantation-related mortality (TRM). Several second-line therapies have been proposed for the management of unresponsive aGVHD, without proven beneficial effects on patients' outcome or overall longterm survival. For these reasons, extracorporeal photochemotherapy/photopheresis (ECP), a cell-based approach to control GVHD that spares generalized immunosuppression, seems to be promising. In this study, we report the outcome of 72 consecutive pediatric patients treated with ECP between 1997 and 2013 for aGVHD. Among them, 21 patients had steroid-resistant aGVHD, 42 had steroid-dependent aGVHD, and 9 did not receive steroid as first-line therapy because of clinical contraindications. A complete response was obtained in 72% of patients, a partial response was observed in 11%, and there was no response in 17% of patients. At day \u00fe180, TRM was 4% in the whole cohort; TRM was 3% and 20% among responders and nonresponders to ECP, respectively (P < .0001). The 5-year overall survival was 71%, showing a difference between responders and nonresponders of 78% and 30%, respectively (P \u00bc .0004). The 5-year time to progression of primary disease was 81%, without any significant difference between the 2 groups. Moreover, the 5-year progression-free survival of primary disease was 72%, with a significant difference (P \u00bc .0007) between responders (79%) and nonresponders (30%) to ECP. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that ECP is highly effective in aGVHD without a negative impact on primary disease. \u00d3",

Briefly, ECP consists of 3 procedures: collection of peripheral leukocytes cells, irradiation of cells by ultraviolet A light in presence of 8methoxypsoralen , and reinfusion of treated cells in the patient. The underlying mechanism of action of ECP in GVHD is not completely understood [9, 10] . Within 24 hours, this process induces apoptosis of all treated cells (including T cells) and subsequent phagocytosis by antigen-presenting cells; as a result, this might regulate immune homoeostasis, modulate the cytokine production, and induce tolerance of antigen-presenting cells [10] [11] [12] [13] .",

Fifteen of these 72 patients have been previously reported [20] . The clinical characteristics of patients are shown in Table 1 . The median age at ECP was 8.3 years (range, .9 to 20.3 years) and the median body weight was 25 kg (range, 7 to 98 kg). Fifteen children weighted less than 15 kg. The last follow-up was fixed on June 2014. In detail, 21 patients were treated with ECP for aGVHD refractory to steroids, which was defined as a progression or no improvement in aGVHD after at least 3 days or 7 days on methylprednisolone (MP) ! 2 mg/kg body weight, respectively (SR group); 21 patients for steroid-dependant aGVHD, defined as a flare-up of aGVHD during the tapering of MP (SD group); and 30 children with aGVHD who required a reduction of pharmacological IS or contraindications to IS therapy for viral reactivations, systemic mycoses, or intolerable side effects (group with infectious complications [IC]). In particular, 9 of 30 patients in the IC group (IC-A group) underwent ECP without steroids as a first-line therapy because of contraindications: 1 for TCR ab and CD19edepleted haploidentical transplantation with probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) and adenovirus (ADV), 1 for proven IPA, 1 for concomitant proved  IPA and cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation, 1 for probable IPA and CMV  and BK virus (BKV) reactivations, 1 for proven IPA and multiple viral reactivations, including ADV, CMV, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), 2 for CMV  reactivation, 1 for CMV and EBV reactivations, and 1 for CMV, EBV, ADV, and BKV reactivations.

In our sample size, we found a higher overall response rate to ECP compared with a multicenter retrospective study of the Italian Association for Pediatric Hematology/Oncology (AIEOP) (72% versus 54%) [18] . We attempted to determine the factors that may have influenced our observed higher response. In the last 15 years, many changes have been introduced in HSCT, such as highresolution HLA typing, new agents in the conditioning regimen, more use of ATG, monoclonal antibodies, and new antifungal drugs. It is difficult to determine which modification may have influenced the outcome. We could also hypothesize that specific expertise in pediatric HSCT and earlier treatment with ECP (22 days in our series versus 30 days in AEIOP study) may have improved the overall outcome. Further studies are needed to address this topic.",

In addition, in our series, no difference was found according to the grade of GVHD (grade I and II, 78%; versus grade III and IV, 66%; P \u00bc .70) and to the subgroups of patients analyzed (SR, 67%; SD, 81%; IC, 70%; P \u00bc .91). Our results showed better response rate than those reported in literature for advanced stages of disease, where higher grades and poorer response to IS therapy correlate with a worst outcome [6] . Nevertheless, higher CR rates were observed in grade II GVHD, suggesting that an early start of ECP sessions may be beneficial, even if in our study the timing to start ECP (<22 versus > 22 days) did not influence the response. In our group, ECP seemed to be effective in all the involved organs. As previously reported, our results support that ECP is a steroid-sparing treatment; in fact, the steroid dose was reduced by 80%, 84%, and 88% after 1, 2, and 3 months, respectively from the onset of ECP. We performed ECP as front-line therapy in 8 patients with fungal infection and viral reactivation and aGVHD, with complete response in 7 of them. To our knowledge, this is the first report of ECP as first-line treatment. IS therapy was either discontinued or reduced in 78% of responding patients. It is well known from the literature that IS therapy increases the risk of infectious complications and relapse of underlying disease after allo-HSCT [1, 2, 18, 20, 28, 35] .",

            "text": "Many concerns has been raised related to the technical aspects of apheresis in the pediatric setting. In children with low body weight, the caregivers should carefully monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypovolemia. In our experience, ECP was well tolerated, with few and mild adverse effects, the most frequent of which were mild hypotension, abdominal pain, and headache. Curiously, these symptoms were recorded more often during ECP compared with other apheretic procedures [19, 34] . The majority of side effects were observed in the earliest period in which ECP was performed in our center. All these observations support the idea that there has been a learning process for the management of technical elements and side effects. In our experience, ECP was feasible even in 15 very young children with low body weight (<15 kg). Technically, we performed priming of the circuit with irradiated and leukodepleted red blood cells (regardless of baseline hemoglobin level). Some authors recently reported that saline infusion or albumin boluses may be an alternative priming approach in patients with body weight ranging from 19 to 39 kg [36] . However, it should be proven that this approach could be safely transferred to population weighting less than 15 kg. Currently used ECP techniques include the \"off-line\" and the \"in-line\" devices [19] . In our center, both techniques were used in different time periods with no difference in response rate observed. The number of WBC collected and MNC reinfused did not affect clinical outcome. Notably, all patients underwent the procedure with the bilumen central venous line already in place (Hickman-Broviac Bard Access Systems, Salt Lake City, UT, USA), which is different from the majority of reports, in which a larger central venous line (for instance, quinton) is placed. It would be interesting to extend our experience to determine if urokinase anticoagulation allows the proper flow rate of pre-existing central venous line. Further, because of the experience of the staff in completing the procedure, no patient required sedation.",
