Methods: This study used Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) and the Bland-Altman plot to analyse the agreement between temperature measurements using an ingestible capsule sensor, a skin sensor and two non-invasive peripheral temperature measurements (axillary and infrared non-contact), collected from a population of febrile patient admitted for infectious disease. Results: Of the 77 febrile patients screened, 26 patients were enrolled. The ICC between axillary temperature measurements (Taxi) vs. non-contact measurements (Tno-c) were 0.34 [ \u22120.18; 0.63], 0.87 [0.55; 0.94] between Taxi vs. ingestible capsule measurements (Tcap) and 0.12 [ \u22120.09; 0.37] between Taxi vs. Tetac. The mean difference between Taxi vs Tno-c was \u22121.18 \u00b0C with limits of agreement (LoA) from \u22122.96 to 0.58 \u00b0C. The mean difference between Taxi vs Tcap was 0.48 \u00b0C, with LoA from \u22120.60 to 1.56 \u00b0C.

To calculate ICC, McGraw and Wong defined 10 forms of ICC based on three \"models\" (one-way random effects, two-way random effects, or two-way fixed effects) and two \"types\" (single rater/measurement or the mean of k raters/measurements). This study chose the two-way mixed-effects model because repeated measurements cannot be considered to be randomised samples.

The Bland-Altman plot shows that more than 95% of points are within the limits of agreement, but 95% of points show that the difference between the Taxi vs. Tno-c is lower than zero. The mean difference between Taxi vs. Tno-c is \u22121.18 \u00b0C, which is higher than the clinically acceptable range ( \u00b10.5 \u00b0C). This method underestimates core temperature because non-contact forehead temperature measurements could be influenced by blood flow under the skin, body metabolic rate and the distance between the thermometer and forehead. Moreover, according to the Bland-Altman plot, the difference between the two temperature measurements increases as the temperature increases. Therefore, this method is neither sufficiently reliable nor clinically acceptable for screening for fever in adult febrile patients. Skin sensors (eTact patches) exhibit a weak uphill linear relationship ( r = 0.42) and a poor strength of agreement (ICC < 0.40) with axillary temperature measurements. Skin temperature can be influenced by many factors such as blood flow under the skin, the body's metabolic rate and ambient temperature [27] . Thus, this method was less consistent than the core temperature measurements (SD of eTact measurements was 1.84 and the SD of ingestible capsule measurements was 1.01). The Bland-Altman plot shows that 95% of points were within the limits of agreement, but many of the points were further from zero. The mean difference was \u22124.23 \u00b0C, as the theory indicated; the skin temperature was 2-4 \u00b0C below the core temperature. However, this method did not correlate well with the reference temperature, so it is not acceptable for fever screening.",

According to the Bland-Altman plot, 95% of points are within the limits of agreement, and the mean difference between Taxi vs Tcap is 0.48 \u00b0C, which is within the clinically acceptable range ( \u00b10.5 \u00b0C). This difference between axillary temperature measurements and temperature measurements of ingestible capsules is, as the theory indicates, in the range of 0.5-1 \u00b0C. Compared to other core temperature measurement methods, the ingestible capsule is less invasive and more comfortable method for patients. This method produces continuous body temperature measurements during gastro-intestinal transit. However, cold or hot food and drink intake can influence capsule temperature measurements [28] . According to Domitrovich, measurements of ingestible capsules are reliable after only 40 min of ingestion (when the sensor passes the stomach) [29] . In our study, we therefore took this constraint into account when analysing the data. Ingestible temperature sensors are an easy way to follow and monitor core temperature; it has been reported that continuous core temperature measurements help to predict the early diagnosis of hospital-acquired sepsis [30] . Continuous core temperature measurements could offer a different perspective on patterns of fever and detect abnormal core temperature curves at an earlier stage. Monitoring core body temperature in real time on a continuous basis might be very useful in cases of factitious fevers, chronic infections and fevers of unknown origin. Non aggressive, continuous real time recording of the body temperature during infection offers a new tool to study the relationship between temperature and the infectious process [31] . However, ingestible telemetric body core temperature sensors have some limitations: the main one being the gastrointestinal transit time, as transit time varies for each individual due to age, gender, diet and pathology. The variability of the transit time ranges from 0.52 day to 5.6 days and the mean transit time is 2 \u00b1 1.5 days [32] . This resulted in missing measurements in our study, due to the absence of indications from the capsule. However, if needed, capsules can be prescribed every three days and the monitor can follow four capsules at the same time. Another inconvenience was the exclusion of patients who might require an MRI scan, who represented 15% of febrile patients in our cohort. However, one final positive aspect of this type of measurement is that, in our experience, the time spent by the nurse waiting for axillary temperature readings was calculated in our study as 2.83 \u00b1 0.66 min. The cumulated time spent by nurses waiting to collect axillary temperature readings in our study was estimated at 12.26 h. Although a full medico-economic study is required, it is likely that the capsule would save time.",
