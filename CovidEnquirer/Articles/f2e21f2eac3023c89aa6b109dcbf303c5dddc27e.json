These guidelines consider new aspects of hand hygiene promotion, including behavioral and transcultural issues. Within this framework, the present article reflects the findings of the WHO's Task Force on Religious and Cultural Aspects of Hand Hygiene. The Task Force was created to explore the potential influence of transcultural and religious factors on attitudes toward hand hygiene practices among health care workers and to identify some possible solutions for integrating these into strategies for improving hand hygiene.",

Bibliographies of retrieved articles were also hand-searched for additional studies. Relevant books on culture and health were consulted as well. Leaders from the most important religions affiliated with the World Council of Churches (a fellowship of churches associated in an ecumenical movement to promote Christian unity) and the Muslim World League (an Islamic nongovernmental organization that promotes Islamic unity) were individually consulted to gather knowledge regarding the importance of hygiene, hand hygiene, and alcohol prohibition within the precepts and holy texts of their faiths. A total of 2332 articles were retrieved through the Medline search. Many of the articles referred to ''culture'' in the microbiological sense and had to be eliminated, together with numerous articles restricted to mental health. Of the remaining articles, only 27 referred to cultural and/or religious aspects influencing health, in particular hygiene, hand hygiene practices, and alcohol prohibition according to the most important religions; these were retained for review.",

This imprinting subsequently affects the attitude toward hand cleansing throughout life, particularly ''inherent hand hygiene,'' which reflects the instinctive need to remove dirt from the skin. The attitude toward hand cleansing in more specific opportunities, called ''elective hand hygiene practice,'' more frequently corresponds to the indications for hand hygiene during health care delivery. 2, 8 In some populations, both inherent and elective hand hygiene practices may be deeply influenced by cultural and religious factors, although establishing whether a strong inherent attitude toward hand hygiene directly determines an increased elective behavior has proven difficult. Hand hygiene can be practiced for hygienic reasons, for ritualistic reasons during religious ceremonies, and for symbolic reasons in specific everyday life situations (Table 1) .",

In the Sikh culture, hand hygiene is not only a holy act, but also an essential element of daily life. Islam places great emphasis on cleanliness 10 in both its physical and spiritual aspects, and the Qu'ran gives clear instructions as to how this should be carried out (Table 1) . 16, 17 With the exception of the ritual sprinkling of holy water on hands before consecration of the bread and wine and the washing of hands after touching the holy oil (the latter in the Catholic Church), the Christian faith does not include definite indications for hand cleansing. In general, the indications given by Christ's example refer more to spiritual behavior, but the emphasis on this specific viewpoint does not imply that personal hygiene and body care are not important in the Christian way of life. Similarly, the Buddhist faith has no specific indications regarding hand hygiene in daily life or during ritual occasions, apart from the hygienic act of washing hands after each meal.",

In the Sikh culture, as in Mahayana and Tibetan Buddhism, a specific cultural meaning is given to the habit of folding the hands together as a form of greeting, in prayer, or as a mark of respect. Studies have demonstrated the importance of the role of gestures in teaching and learning, and there is certainly a potential advantage to considering this in the teaching of hand hygiene, particularly in its representation in pictorial images for different cultures. 19, 20 In multimodal strategies to promote hand hygiene, posters placed in key points in health care settings have proven to be very effective tools for reminding health care workers to cleanse their hands. 2, 8, 21 Efforts to consider specific hand uses and gestures according to local customs in visual posters, including education and promotion material, may help convey the intended message more effectively.

Otherwise, rubbing the hands with an alcohol-based formulation is recommended as the preferred practice for all other hand hygiene indications during patient care, because it is faster, more effective, and better tolerated by the skin. But infection control practitioners find it difficult to precisely define the meaning of ''visibly dirty'' and to provide practical examples when teaching hand hygiene. From a transcultural perspective, finding a common understanding of this term is even more difficult; for example, a spot of blood or other proteinaceous material is more difficult to see on very dark skin. Furthermore, in a hot and humid climate, the need to wash the hands with fresh water also may be driven by the feeling of sticky or humid skin.",

The cultural issue of feeling cleaner after handwashing rather than after hand rubbing actually was raised recently during a widespread hand hygiene campaign in Hong Kong and may underlie the inability to sustain the excellent hand hygiene compliance attained during the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic (W.H.

Nonetheless, in theory, those religions with an alcohol prohibition in everyday life demonstrate a pragmatic vision that allows acceptance of the most valuable approach in the perspective of optimal patient care delivery. Despite this generally tolerant approach, however, the religious background still may influence some health care workers who are unwilling to use alcohol-based formulations due to either reluctance to come in contact with alcohol or concerns about alcohol ingestion, inhalation, or skin absorption. 8, 26 Even the designation of a product simply as an ''alcohol-based formulation'' could become an obstacle for the implementation of worldwide recommendations.",

Indeed, hand rub dispensers have been installed in numerous health care settings since 2005. 26 This experience demonstrates that alcohol-containing hand rub solutions are indeed finally acceptable to many Muslim health care workers, even within an Islamic kingdom legislated by Sharia (Islamic law), and this may encourage other Muslims to reconsider their attitude (Fig 2) .",

[29] [30] [31] [32] In a study mimicking high-quantity, high-frequency use, 31 the cutaneous absorption of 2 alcohol-based hand rubs with different alcohol components (ethanol and isopropanol) was carefully monitored. Whereas insignificant levels of ethanol were measured in the breath and serum of a minority of the participants, isopropanol was not detected. Finally, alcohol smell on the skin may be an additional barrier to the use of hand rubs; further product development should be conducted to eliminate this smell from hand rub preparations.",

            "text": "In addition to targeting areas for further research, some possible solutions to existing problems may be identified (Table 3) . For example, starting in childhood, the inherent nature of hand hygiene, which is strongly influenced by religious habits and norms in some populations, could be shaped in favor of an optimal elective behavior toward hand hygiene. Indeed, some studies have demonstrated that it is possible to successfully educate children of school age to practice optimal hand hygiene to help prevent common pediatric community-acquired infections. [33] [34] [35] When preparing such guidelines, international and local religious authorities should be consulted and their advice clearly reported. An example of this is the statement issued by the Muslim Scholars' Board of the Muslim World League at its 16th annual meeting in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, in January 2002: ''It is allowed to use medicines that contain alcohol in any percentage that may be necessary for manufacturing if it cannot be substituted. Alcohol may be used as an external wound cleanser, to kill germs and in external creams and ointments.'' 36 In hand hygiene promotion campaigns in health care settings in which religions prohibiting the use of alcohol are represented, educational strategies should include focus groups on this topic to allow health care workers to openly raise their concerns regarding the use of alcohol-based hand rubs, help them understand the scientific evidence underlying this recommendation, and identify possible solutions to overcome obstacles ( Table 3) . Results of these discussions could be summarized in an information leaflet to be produced and distributed locally. It has been suggested that in settings in which the observance of related religious norms is very strict, the term ''alcohol'' be avoided in favor of the adjective ''antiseptic'' when describing hand rubs. But concealing the true nature of the product by using a nonspecific term may be construed by some as deceptive and considered unethical. Further research is needed before any final recommendation along these lines can be made. Finally, the opportunity to involve patients in a multimodal strategy to promote hand hygiene in health care should be carefully evaluated. Despite its potential value, this intervention may be premature in settings in which religious proscriptions are taken literally; rather, it could be a later step, after the achievement of awareness and compliance among health care workers.",
