Ihre to its close phylognetic relationship with Toxoplasma gondii, respective unequivocal differentiaI diagnosis deserves special consideration. In order to evaluate the diagnostic performance of molecular and insmunodiagnosric te&n@es and to provide insights into the epidemiological significance of bovine neosporosis in Switzerland, we aondu&ed a sQ# on 83 cases of bovine abortion: of these, 24 (29%) foetal brains were positive by Neospora-FCR, six of these fo%Wses were simultaneously seropositive in Neospora-IFAT and/or somatic antigen-ELISA. Converseiy, four (5%)feMal k&s were considered positive by Toxoplasma-PCR, two of which were also seropositive in the Toxu@zs~~-P%J-~L~~A and/or direct agglutination test. The seroprevalence in 1689 cattle sera obtained from 113 dairy farms was 11.3% (95% confidence interval: 9.2-13.8) by Neospora-somatic antigen-ELISA and 10.7% (95% confidence interval: U-12.6) by Toxopkrma-P30-ELISA. From the same samples, l.l%, less than statistically expected, were positive in bo6h BUSA. Within selected groups of cow-calf farms, the seroprevalence determined using the Neospora-somatic anwn-ELBA was 14% (95% confidence interval: U-23.0) for darns and 15% (95% confidence interval: 3.0-28,O) for ~a~~~~a~ves. Seroprevalences detetmined by Toxoplasma-P30-ELISA were 8% (95% confidence interval: 4.0-12.0) for dams and 3% (95% confidence interval: 0.3-6.0) for calves.

Both diseases occur world-wide [l] ; however, there is a paucity of information available on the epidemiological situation of neosporosis in Switzerland. Neosporosis was described as an important cause of economic and reproductive loss to the livestock industry [7, 81 . Outbreaks of confirmed Neospora-related abortions as well as the prevalence of neosporosis-associated abortions reported from several countries (reviewed by [2] ) justify an epidemiological pilot study in Switzerland.

            "text": "Conventional diagnosis of neosporosis in cattle has been based largely on the post mortem demonstration of the organisms in clinical material, e.g., by histology or immunohistology performed on tissue sections of the brain and other organs. Histopathological examination may reveal minimal histologic lesions, such as focal gliosis in the CNS, [9] as well as severe neural lesions, such as nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis characterised by multifocal non-suppurative infiltration, with or without multifocal necrosis and multifocal to diffuse non-suppurative leukocytic infiltration of the meninges [2] , and occasionally calcifications. Diagnosis may also be achieved by the cultivation of the parasites in experimental animals or cell cultures. Moreover, demonstration of parasite antigens in tissue sections, e.g., by means of immunohistochemistry [lo] , is a valuable adjunct diagnostic approach. An indirect method refers to the assessment of the host's humoral immune response by the demonstration of parasite-specific antibodies in serum or other body fluids, such as by means of the IFAT [9,1 l] or the ELISA [12, 13] . These tests deserve special attention since they are required to discriminate between infection with different apicomplexan parasites [14] . Immunodiagnostic tools have been used to determine epidemic parameters associated with Neospora-induced abortion in cows and to study prenatal and postnatal transmission [I 51. With respect to the molecular identification of Neospora, a substantial improvement in the diagnostic sensitivity was achieved by designing oligonucleotide primers suitable for the PCR amplification of N. caninum-specific genomic sequences isolated from clinical samples [16-l 91 . Subsequently, the PCR established in our laboratory [18, 191 was developed further to achieve routine practicability by the introduction of the uracil DNA glycosidase (UDG) system [20] and a rapid and simple amplification-detection system known as DNA-Hybridisation Immunoassay (DIA) [21] .",

Additional results of pathological findings are also included in Table 1 . Histological examination of the 24 Neospora-PCR-positive samples revealed that 18 samples exhibited pathologic findings compatible with neosporosis. For samples obtained from either the brain and/or the placenta, seven cases included mukifocal necrotising encephalitis, two cases hypopksia of the cerebellum, one case hydrocephalus internus and five cases multifocal necrotising placentitis or calcification within the placenta, among other features (for details see Table l ), which were not indicative of a protozoa1 infection in most cases. In most of the 24 Neospora-PCR-positive cases, no other infectious agents were found. Exceptions were two foetal BVDV cases and one case of Streptococcus detection in the placenta. From the three foetal brain samples which were only positive by Toxoplasma-PCR (but Neospora-PCR-negative), the histological examinations, performed prior to PCR investigations, had already provided pathologic findings indicative of a protozoal infection (random multifocal necrotic lesions in the brain, calcified microlesions in the placenta and conjunctivitis). The single case positive for both Neospora-and Toxophma-PCR showed also multifocal calcifications in the placenta, but no specific pathology in the foetal tissues could be found.

This lack of technical sensitivity may also be one explanation why, in previous attempts, demonstration of T. gondii in bovine foetuses has failed in many cases [28] . The unavailability of sensitive techniques may have considerably hampered previous studies on the reliability of prevalence assessment [ 151. In these studies, conventional histopathology criteria, beside immunohistochemistry, were also included to select positive cases of bovine neosporosis related to abortion.

Although applying two different cut-off titres in our IFAT for foetuses and calves/cows, the results obtained indicated that this would not have been necessary in that antibody titres of all animals were either at dilutions < l/80 or 2 l/l 60. For ELISA, it had been shown previously that the use of different cut-off absorbance values for foetal or adult cattle sera may lead to false-positive results [31] . Due to the lack of appropriate experiences, we had decided not to apply different threshold ELISA values indicative for N. caninum infection in foetuses. The full characterisation of operating characteristics of our ELISA still requires further parametric investigations with special emphasis on the problem in question, and we will have to consider the determination of different threshold values for different groups of animals in future investigations. Furthermore, new developments in the purification or biotechnologic synthesis of Neospora antigens with improved immunodiagnostic potential will have to be considered in future studies [12, 13, 321 . Our thus relatively preliminary serological results have shown that only 25% of the foetuses with a positive cerebral Neospora-PCR had detectable antibodies against Neospora at the time of abortion. It has been shown in previous work that the seroprevalence in foetuses increased with gestational age [30] . The same authors had found anti-N. caninum antibodies in 37 of 74 foetuses with Parasitology 28 (1998) 679491 689 suspected or confirmed neosporosis-associated abortion; 31 of these 37 seropositive foetuses were 6months of gestational age or older. In our study, all except one Neospora-seropositive foetus were 7-9 months of gestational age or older, whereas the larger part of seronegative foetuses was significantly younger. Thus the failure to find anti-N. caninum antibodies indicated that most of our foetuses may not yet have reached the appropriate humoral immunocompetence during the acute phase of infection until abortion. In addition, we have studied in 12 cases the association between the serological results of the foetus and the corresponding dam in parallel. Only one of the foetuses was seropositive, whereas five of the dams were seropositive. From the seronegative foetuses, four were positive by Neospora-PCR performed on brain tissue. Although the data are based upon only a few cases, we could thus obtain an indication that prenatal neosporosis seems to be related predominantly to seropositive dams, but that most of the foetuses were not able to seroconvert during infection prior to abortion. This information indicates that serological screening in foetuses is of relatively little diagnostic value, whereas serological pre-screening in dams may provide some indication for a potential prenatal transmission of the parasite. However, more field data are needed in order to provide clear statistical evidence for these observations.",

Furthermore, we showed that PCR combined with serology does accurately discriminate between Neospora and Toxoplasma infection. Finally, the association between specific pathologic findings in the foetal brain, the demonstration of Neospora DNA at the same site, and the absence of other aetiological abortive microorganisms in most cases not only indicate foetal infection, but also support the hypothesis of a causative role of the parasitic infection for abortion in Switzerland. The high rate of Neospora-PCRpositivity within abortion events in Swiss cattle justifies, therefore, further studies on the molecular epidemiology and pathogenesis of neosporosis in Switzerland.",
