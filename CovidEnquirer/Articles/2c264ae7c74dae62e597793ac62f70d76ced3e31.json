The colony-forming ability of E. coli was completely lost in 0.5 min on both of Ag/Al 2 O 3 and AgCl/Al 2 O 3 at room temperature in air. The configuration of the bacteria on the catalyst surface was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in the expression of the bactericidal activity on the surface of catalysts by assay with O 2 /N 2 bubbling and scavenger for ROS. Furthermore, the formation of CO 2 as an oxidation product could be detected by diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and be deduced by total carbon analysis. These results strongly support that the bactericidal process on the surface of Ag/Al 2 O 3 and AgCl/Al 2 O 3 was caused by the catalytic oxidation.",

Obviously, the processes with Ag/Al 2 O 3 (Fig. 1b) and AgCl/Al 2 O 3 (Fig. 1c) show a higher bactericidal effect on E. coli than Al 2 O 3 . The bacteria lost their colony forming ability in 0.5 min after applied onto the wafer of Ag/Al 2 O 3 and AgCl/Al 2 O 3. The spoiling of bacteria was also observed by SEM photographs as shown in Fig. 2 . Fig. 2a and b show the SEM images of E. coli adhered on Al 2 O 3 at room temperature for 0.5 min and 24 h, respectively. Although some cells were damaged after E. coli exposured to the wafer of Al 2 O 3 for 0.5 min, the viable cells were still detectable using plate counting method. Some cells collapsed and led to release of intracellular constituents, however, their membrane and intracellular constituents covered the surface even after 24 h. Fig. 2c -e and f-h show the SEM images of E. coli adhered on AgCl/Al 2 O 3 and Ag/ Al 2 O 3 at room temperature for 0.5 min, 0.5 and 1 h, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1 , it is obvious that Ag/Al 2 O 3 and AgCl/Al 2 O 3 gave a higher bactericidal effect on E. coli than Al 2 O 3 . Although AgCl/Al 2 O 3 exhibited a similar bactericidal ability comparing with Ag/Al 2 O 3 , the SEM images indicate that different mechanisms are involved in the bactericidal action of AgCl/Al 2 O 3 and Ag/Al 2 O 3 . The cell membrane damage mainly started at one end of E. coli on the surface of AgCl/Al 2 O 3 (Fig. 2c) , and intracellular constituents were released from the damaged site. After exposure time of 0.5 h, the cell was further spoiled (Fig. 2d) . After 1 h, the clean catalyst surface reappeared (Fig. 2e) . The damage of bacteria on the surface of Ag/Al 2 O 3 was more serious than that of AgCl/Al 2 O 3 (Fig. 2f-h) . Even though after 30 s on AgCl/Al 2 O 3 , a great deal of intracellular constituents spouted from damaged sites on the cell membrane (Fig. 2f) . After exposure time of 0.5 h, E. coli cells shrank and the catalyst surface covered by the cells reappeared (Fig. 2g, h) .",

During the process of the E. coli suspension contacted with Ag/ Al 2 O 3 and AgCl/Al 2 O 3 , Ag + released unavoidablely. In order to confirm the bactericidal effect of Ag + , the catalyst wafers were dip in sterile water for 10 min and the quantitative analysis of Ag + in the eluate was carried out with an atomic adsorption spectrophotometer. The bactericidal effect of a series of AgNO 3 (10 \u00c09 , 10 \u00c08 , 10 \u00c05 , 10 \u00c04 , 10 \u00c03 M) contacting with E. coli suspension for 10 min were determined. The correlation between the concentration of Ag + and the quantity of survival cells was reflected in a curve, so the effect of Ag + released from the catalyst can be confirmed. As shown in Fig. 3 , the colony-forming ability of E. coli lost in Ag + containing solution when the concentration of Ag + is more than 10 \u00c04 M. The concentrations of Ag + eluted from Ag/Al 2 O 3 and AgCl/Al 2 O 3 were less than 2.9 \u00b7 10 \u00c04 M and 4.7 \u00b7 10 \u00c07 M under such experimental conditions, respectively. According to this result, Ag + was released from the catalysts, and the bactericidal ability of the Ag/Al 2 O 3 would be related to the amount of Ag + dissolved in a certain extent. However the amount of Ag + eluted from AgCl/Al 2 O 3 is too little to cause any bactericidal effect against E. coli.",

The bubbling was continued throughout the treatment period. The bactericidal activity of Al 2 O 3 under the same condition was studied as the control experiment. The results are shown in Fig. 4 . Under the anaerobic condition, the bactericidal activity of Ag/Al 2 O 3 sharply decreased compared to that in the aerobic condition. Though the bactericidal activity of AgCl/Al 2 O 3 was lower than Ag/Al 2 O 3 , it can also be obviously observed that the bactericidal activity in aerobic condition is better than that in anaerobic condition. These results suggest that nitrogen gas bubbling drastically suppresses the bactericidal activity of Ag/Al 2 O 3 , and indicate that the presence of oxygen is necessary for the bactericidal activity by Ag/ Al 2 O 3 and AgCl/Al 2 O 3 .",
