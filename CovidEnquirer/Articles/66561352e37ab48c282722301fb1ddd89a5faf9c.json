At the heart of security is the idea of protection or insurance against downside risk. 1,2 Three distinct questions arise from the concept of human security. First, protection of what? Second, insurance against what? And, third, security for whom?",

The defi nition of human security off ered by the Commission on Human Security 3 is: \"to protect the vital core of all human lives in ways that enhance human freedoms and human fulfi lment\". The core of a person's life is closely concerned with the person's wellbeing and agency, which is best viewed in terms of his or her \"capability\" to achieve alternative \"beings and doings\". 4 In this context, health assumes central importance for two reasons: it is directly constitutive of a person's wellbeing; and it enables a person to function as an agent-that is, to pursue the various goals and projects in life that he or she has reason to value. This view deploys the notion of well-functioning, but it is not grounded in notions of economic welfare that are based on utility or income. It is, rather, an agency-centred view of a person, for whom ill health restricts the scope of human agency. Since our ability to do things typically depends on our being alive, the capability to lead a long and healthy life must itself be regarded as a basic capability.",

Here the concern is to insure against falling below an adequate threshold of human capabilities-in the case of a person's health, a minimum acceptable level. The probability of falling below a minimum threshold depends on both how vulnerable a person is-the degree of downside risk the person facesand how much above the threshold he or she is in the relevant dimension. 1 The extreme case of insecurity is certainty of being below a specifi ed threshold, and the absence of any chance of avoiding that fate.",

Otherwise, we risk alienating patients and damaging the therapeutic alliance. As part of the eradication eff ort, WHO requested that countries and laboratories either destroy the remainder of their stocks of variola, the causative agent of occupational, and dietary. But access to appropriate health care is also a vital factor in protecting a person from the risk of ill health, and especially of catastrophic ill health. Comprehensive health care is thus important both in promotion of health and in response to health crises. Without health insurance, a severe medical crisis that threatens survival, for example, can have disastrous fi nancial implications-that can aff ect human security in many other dimensions.",

Over the decades, Japan has also undertaken policies to advance human security in other dimensions, such as basic education, social protection, and economic safety nets. Internationally, Japan has used the concept of human security to guide assistance to developing countries through bilateral aid and multilateral policies. The range and reach of the idea of human security are extensive, as Japanese actions have shown. A central manifestation of these actions is the country's commitment to universal health insurance.",
