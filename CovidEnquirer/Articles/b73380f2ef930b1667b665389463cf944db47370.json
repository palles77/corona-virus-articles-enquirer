In medicine, thermal imaging has been used for more than 50 years in various clinical settings, including Raynaud's phenomenon and systemic sclerosis. Imaging and quantification of surface body temperature provides an indirect measure of the microcirculation's overall performance. As such, IRT is capable of confirming the diagnosis of Raynaud's phenomenon, and, with additional cold or heat challenge, of differentiating between the primary and secondary condition. In systemic sclerosis IRT has a potential role in assessing disease activity and monitoring treatment response. Despite certain limitations, thermal imaging can find a place in clinical practice, and with the introduction of small, low-cost infrared cameras, possibly become a part of routine rheumatological evaluation.",

Prototype IR devices were developed by the military during and after the Second World War. In the late 1950s, IR technology was made available for industry and civilian science. At the turn of the century, thanks to steady technological progress, the bulky IR cameras with liquid nitrogen cooling were replaced by portable, commercially available devices. This led to more widespread use of IRT in diverse fields of science, including medicine. This review will explore the current and possible future applications of IRT in diagnostics of Raynaud's phenomenon and related connective tissue diseases.",

IRT allows visualization and quantification of this phenomenon, providing information on the temperature range of the observed object.",

Several pathological processes can induce either systemic or local thermal anomalies, e.g. increased temperature due to infection, inflammation, trauma and malignancy or decreased temperature due to ischemia. Since physiological alterations, such as temperature change, precede anatomical abnormalities observed in classical medical imaging, IRT is a potential tool for very early detection of these conditions. It should be stressed, however, that multiple factors such as age, time of day and year, state of consciousness, emotions, activity level, hormonal imbalance and medications can have a great influence on human body temperature [4] . Accordingly, thermograms should be interpreted with caution, in the context of the full clinical picture and results of other imaging studies.",

            "text": "As mentioned above, IRT may play an important role in the initial diagnosis of SSc. However, its significance in assessing disease activity or monitoring treatment response is less clear. One of the promising clinical applications is determining the status and nature of DUs. A focal temperature increase of the DU, in otherwise hypoperfused fingers, is strongly suggestive of active inflammation. In parallel, a 'cold spot' might indicate ischemia and presence of dead tissue (Fig. 4) . Weijden et al. [18] reported an interesting case of an SSc patient in whom IRT made it possible to differentiate between bacterial infection of the DU and ischemic necrosis, thus having a significant impact on clinical decision-making. The patient presented with a thermographic 'hot-spot' in the area of the DU, where the presence of deep-tissue infection was confirmed through magnetic resonance imaging and microbiological cultures. After antibiotic treatment, clinical and biochemical signs of infection subsided, but the DU did not heal. IRT showed an area of extremely low temperature in the affected toe, consistent with critical ischemia and possibly necrosis, which mandated surgical treatment.",
