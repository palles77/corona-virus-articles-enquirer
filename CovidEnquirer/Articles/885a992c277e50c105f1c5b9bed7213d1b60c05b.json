McAdam, MD, PhD a,b, *, Ann Marie Riley, BS b There are now several technologies available for detection of viruses, including those viruses which frequently cause respiratory tract infections. The available methods range from insensitive, but technically simple and inexpensive, point-of-care tests to highly sensitive, but technically challenging and expensive, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) . While viral culture is moderately technically challenging, it is simpler than NAAT and it has advantages over immunoassays in sensitivity for some viruses and for the types of viruses that can be readily detected.",

Each tube is periodically checked for the presence of replicating virus by hemadsorption (HA) for influenza and parainfluenza viruses, and by microscopy for cytopathic effect (CPE) for the other viruses. Once HA or CPE has been detected, the presence of the suspected viruses is confirmed by staining the cells by immunofluorescence.",

The advantages of viral culture are first, that it is more sensitive than immunoassays for most respiratory viruses, and second, that it is far simpler and cheaper than NAAT.

MDCK cells have been genetically modified to express higher levels of the molecule bound by the viral hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins present on the surface of influenza virus strains adapted to growth in human hosts. Influenza viruses bind to host cells through the binding of viral hemagglutinin protein to sialyloligosaccharides on the host-cell surface. 2 After replication, exit of influenza virus from the host cell depends on cleavage of sialic acid from the saccharides on the host cell. The structure of the sialyloligosaccharides differs between different animal species, and the influenza viruses that grow in a given host species preferentially bind and cleave the specific sialyloligosaccharides found in that species. Most of the terminal N-acetyl sialic acid residues on human respiratory epithelial cells are bound to the saccharide in an a2,6-linkage (called NeuAca2,6Gal), and so influenza viruses from humans would be expected to replicate well in cells with surface NeuA-ca2,6Gal. 2 While MDCK cells do have NeuAca2,6Gal on their surface, they also have a second type of cell-surface sialic acid (NeuAca2,3Gal). 3 By increasing the level of NeuAca2,6Gal and decreasing the level of NeuAca2,3Gal present on the surface of MDCK cells, one might be able to make MDCK cells better able to support replication of influenza viruses from human infections.",

During the winters of 2007 to 2008 and 2008 to 2009 many isolates of influenza A (H1N1) were resistant to oseltamivir. 4 Cell lines used for influenza virus culture, including MDCK cells, do not give accurate results in functional assays for oseltamivir resistance, probably because expression of low levels of NeuAca2,6Gal lead to apparent oseltamivir insensitivity even when the virus is susceptible to the drug. 3 Unlike MDCK cells, MDCK-SIAT1 cells allow ready detection of oseltamivir resistance in a bioassay. 3 Matrosovich and colleagues used two wild-type oseltamivir susceptible influenza A strains and their corresponding oseltamivir resistant mutants in a bioassay with MDCK-SIAT1 cells and found that the resistant mutants demonstrated 100-fold, or greater, resistance to oseltamivir. 3 Hatakeyama and colleagues tested a larger number of influenza virus isolates (six H3N2, six H1N1 and five influenza B) in a bioassay for oseltamivir susceptibility with independently generated MDCK engineered to express increased levels of NeuAca2,6Gal (which they called ST6Gal I cells). 5 They found that reduction of plaque size by 50% in greater than 90% of plaques, rather than plaque number, accurately reflected the susceptibility of the viruses to oseltamivir. The gold standard for oseltamivir susceptibility in this study was an in vitro assay for the concentration of oseltamivir which inhibited 50% of the sialidase activity of neuraminidase. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that MDCK-SIAT1 is a good bioassay for oseltamivir susceptibility in influenza A and B viruses.",

Two thirds of the isolates were detected from cell lines, one third were detected only from the MDCK-SIAT1 cells, and none were detected only from the MDCK cells. The titer of virus obtained from clinical specimens was higher in the MDCK-SIAT1 cells than in MDCK cells for influenza A isolates, but the two cell lines yielded similar titers of influenza B. The repeated passage of influenza viruses in MDCK and MDCK-SIAT1 cells does lead to mutations in the genes encoding the viral hemagglutinin protein, but the frequency of mutation was the same regardless of which cell was used. 6 To date, there are no studies that we are aware of that determine whether MDCK cells modified to express high levels of NeuAca2,6Gal are superior to unmodified Developments in Tissue Culture Detection MDCK cells, or to primary monkey kidney cells, when used for routine methods of detection of influenza virus from clinical specimens. The studies discussed earlier use small numbers of samples or methods of viral detection that are unlikely to be used in routine diagnostic laboratories (eg, plaque assays). However, these studies do demonstrate that most influenza A and B isolates that have been tested grow to higher titer in the engineered MDCK cells than in control MDCK cells, and they provide promising, if limited, data suggesting that these cells could be routinely used in a sensitive influenza virus assay.",

Shell-vial culture is performed by centrifuging the specimen onto a monolayer of cells on a coverslip in the bottom of a vial. 1 The culture is incubated for 1 to 4 days before being stained for the presence of virus by immunofluorescence. There is little, if anything, to be gained by reading shell-vial cultures for CPE and this is usually not done. The centrifugation is long (eg, 30 to 60 minutes) and slow (eg, 700 x gravity), and this enhances the viral infectivity. 1 The mechanism by which shell-vial culture increases sensitivity is not known. The selection of which cell types are used, the days that the shell vials are stained, and of course, the specificity of the antibodies used, all determine what viruses can be detected.",

There is little need for longer incubation times because most viruses are detected within 1 or 2 days. Another advantage of shell-vial cultures is a reduction in labor compared with conventional viral culture, which can reduce the cost of the test. There are two potential disadvantages to shell-vial culture. First, if the method is not optimized, shell-vial culture can be less sensitive than conventional culture, and this insensitivity must be carefully assessed before shell-vial culture is adopted. Second, shell-vial culture will only detect the viruses that are supported by the cell lines used and that are detected by the antibody used. As a result, shell-vial cultures typically detect fewer types of virus than a conventional viral culture. But progress has been made in increasing the number of viruses that a shell vial can detect by using multiple cell types in a single vial, and by staining the monolayer with multiple antibodies.",

Typically, these are designed to detect influenza A and B viruses, RSV, adenovirus, and parainfluenza viruses (types 1, 2, and 3). To be adequately sensitive for each of these viruses, two cell lines are used. Most cell types will support proliferation of each of the viruses to differing degrees, but in general the shell-vial cultures include a cell line that supports replication of RSV and adenovirus (eg, HEp-2, A549) and another cell line to support replication of influenza, parainfluenza, and adenovirus (eg, PMK, MDCK). Separate shell vials are usually used for each cell type, but one commercial product combines multiple cell lines in a single shell vial (see later discussion). The number of shell vials of each type inoculated will depend on the number of time points on which vials are harvested for staining by immunofluorescence (usually one or two time points), and the staining strategy, as discussed next.",

First, the cells can be scraped off the cover slip, spotted in multiple wells of a slide, and then dried and fixed. Next, one well can be stained by immunofluorescence for each of the viruses separately, for a total of approximately seven stains. Alternatively, the cells can be stained for immunofluorescence using a pool of antibodies against all the viruses to be detected. If a pooled reagent with a single fluorochrome is used, negative results are obtained directly from the results of the pooled stain. If the pooled stain is positive, however, then individual stains must be done for each of the individual viruses included in the pool. There are now commercial reagents that are a pool of antibodies in which one antibody has a different fluorochrome than all the other antibodies. Millipore markets SimulFluor Pooled DFA reagent, which differentiates RSV from other viruses in the pool, and Diagnostic Hybrids markets the D3 Duet Respiratory Virus Screening Kits, which have differential staining for either influenza A or RSV in pooled reagents. This differentiation allows the specimens positive for the virus with the unique fluorochrome to be reported directly from the results of the pooled stain. Staining with pooled immunofluorescent reagents can result in a savings in labor, although this will depend on which viruses are present in the specimens a laboratory tests and the fraction of specimens that are negative for those viruses.",

Most of these studies did not include DFA in the gold standard for RSV, and since DFA is usually more sensitive than viral culture for RSV, they might overestimate the sensitivity of R-Mix culture. R-Mix has moderately low sensitivity for adenovirus, with a range of 25% to 68.6%. In each study where the comparison was made using fresh clinical specimens, the sensitivity of R-Mix for adenovirus was significantly lower than the sensitivity of conventional culture. Most studies did not include enough specimens with parainfluenza viruses to give a robust estimate of sensitivity, but in general R-Mix appears to be reasonably sensitive for these viruses. The combined sensitivity for parainfluenzas 1, 2 and 3 was 83% in one study, 23 and separate studies found sensitivities of 87.6% and 67% for parainfluenzas 1 and 3, respectively. 24, 25 A major advantage of R-Mix shell vials is the shorter turn-around time for positive and negative results. The time to detection of viruses is shorter with R-Mix than with conventional culture. LaSala and colleagues found that the mean time to detection of influenza virus was 1.1 days and 4.3 days for R-Mix and conventional culture, respectively. 23 For RSV, these authors found that the mean time to detection was 1.6 days and 10.2 days for R-Mix and conventional culture, respectively. The time to issue a negative report for R-Mix viral culture will depend on the days on which the shell vials are stained. Practice varies between the published studies, but in most studies the shell vial culture was complete within 3 days, 23,26 but some do hold them as long as 5 to 10 days. 24, 25 In our laboratory, we stain R-Mix shell vials at 24 and 48 hours, allowing a maximum turn-around time of 2 days. Cryopreserved R-Mix shell vials with a shelf life of up to 6 months are also available. These shell vials have been validated in one study (see Table 2 ). 27 They are reported to have a high sensitivity for influenza viruses, RSV, adenovirus, and parainfluenza viruses when analyzed on day 3.",

They can be used in an accurate bioassay for the response of influenza isolates to neuraminidase inhibitors, and also show promise for use in detection of influenza viruses from clinical specimens. HuH7 cells are another promising cell line for use in viral culture for respiratory viruses, although definitive data supporting the use of these is needed. Shell-vial culture is a sensitive method for detection of respiratory viruses. An important advantage of shell-vial culture is the markedly reduced turn-around time for the culture. While shell vials containing a single cell line can be used to detect respiratory viruses, the total number of shell vials needed, and the labor of the culture, can be reduced using commercial R-Mix shell vials, which have a combination of two cell lines. This combination allows a single type of shell vial to be used for respiratory virus culture.",
