While zoonotic diseases originate from a reservoir, most theoretical studies have principally focused on single-host processes, either exclusively humans or exclusively animals, without considering the importance of animal to human transmission (i.e. spillover transmission) for understanding the dynamics of emerging infectious diseases. Here we aim to investigate the importance of spillover transmission for explaining the number and the size of outbreaks. We propose a simple continuous time stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model with a recurrent infection of an incidental host from a reservoir (e.g. humans by a zoonotic species), considering two modes of transmission, (1) animal-to-human and (2) human-to-human. The model assumes that (i) epidemiological processes are faster than other processes such as demographics or pathogen evolution and that (ii) an epidemic occurs until there are no susceptible individuals left. The results show that during an epidemic, even when the pathogens are barely contagious, multiple outbreaks are observed due to spillover transmission. Overall, the findings demonstrate that the only consideration of direct transmission between individuals is not sufficient to explain the dynamics of zoonotic pathogens in an incidental host.",

Sixty percent of emerging human infectious diseases are zoonotic, i.e. are caused by pathogens that have an animal origin ( Jones et al., 2008; Taylor et al., 2001 ) . The World Health Organization defines zoonotic pathogens as \"pathogens that are naturally transmitted to humans via vertebrate animals\". The epidemics caused by EIDs impact the societal and economical equilibria of countries by causing unexpected deaths and illnesses thereby increasing the need for health care infrastructures and by interfering with travel ( Morens and Fauci, 2013 ) . Moreover, the risk of EIDs being transmitted to humans from wildlife is increasing because of the recent growth and geographic expansion of human populations, climate change and deforestation, which all in-crease the number of contacts between humans and potential new pathogens ( Jones et al., 2008; Keesing et al., 2010; Murray and Daszak, 2013 ) . Given most EIDs have an animal origin, it is crucially important to understand how infections spread from animal to human populations, i.e. by spillover transmission.",

The start of an outbreak is promoted by a primary contact between the reservoir and the incidental host (i.e. host that becomes infected but is not part of the reservoir) leading to the potential transmission of the infection to the host population. Moreover, multiple outbreaks are commonly observed during an epidemic of zoonotic pathogens in human populations, for instance in the case of the epidemic of the Nipah Virus between 2001 and 2007 ( Luby et al., 2009 ) .

While the reservoir has an important role for causing the emergence of outbreaks, the role of spillover transmission on the incidental epidemiological dynamics is rarely discussed. Empirically, it is generally difficult to distinguish between direct transmission and transmission from the reservoir. Only in the case of non-communicable diseases it is easily possible to measure the importance of the recurrent transmission from the reservoir, since all infected individuals originate from a contact with the reservoir. For instance, the H7N9 virus, for which most human cases are due to a contact with an infected poultry, approximately 132 spillovers have been listed during the epidemic of 2013 ( Zhou et al., 2013 ) . For pathogens that are able to propagate from one individual to another, the origin of the infection can be established according to patterns of contacts during the incubation period ( Chowell et al., 2014; Luby et al., 2009 ). Most often, if an infected individual has been in contact with another infected individual in his recent past, direct transmission is considered as the likeliest origin of the infection. However, both individuals might have shared the same environment and thus might have been independently infected by the reservoir. This leads to overestimating the proportion of cases that result from person-to-person transmission. Moreover, when the pathogen infects an individual and the latter does not produce secondary cases then the detection of emergence is unlikely.",

More recent models aimed at investigating the dynamics of EIDs by taking into account the spread of the pathogen using multihost processes but disregarding the persistence of the pathogen in the reservoir ( Singh et al., 2013 ) , or by focusing on the dynamics and conditions of persistence of the pathogen between two populations ( Fenton and Pedersen, 2005 ) .

The authors are mostly interested in the effect of population size and its impact on the size of an outbreak.

To do so, we developed a continuous time stochas- Fig. 1 . Representation of the classification scheme of pathogens proposed by Wolfe et al. (2007) . A pathogen may evolve from infecting only animals (Stage I) to infecting only humans (Stage V). Each stage corresponds to a specific epidemiological dynamics in the incidental host. Stage II corresponds to few spillovers from animals (e.g. bats) to humans with no possible transmission between humans. Stage III corresponds to few stuttering chains of transmission between humans that go extinct (no outbreaks). Stage IV corresponds to large outbreaks in human population but the pathogen cannot be maintained without the reservoir. tic model that can dissociate the effect of between-host (i.e. direct) transmission from the effect of spillover (i.e. reservoir) transmission. A multi-host process with a reservoir and an incidental host is considered. The epidemiological processes are stochastic, which is particularly relevant in the case of transmission from the reservoir and more realistic because only a small number of individuals are expected to be infected at the beginning of an outbreak. The model makes a number of assumptions. First, the epidemiological processes are much faster than the demographic processes. Second, the pathogen in the reservoir is considered as endemic and might contaminate recurrently the incidental host. Third, an individual cannot become susceptible after having been infected. As a consequence, the total number of susceptible individuals in the incidental host decreases during the epidemic. This is what is expected for an epidemic spreading locally during a short period of time (at the scale of a few thousands individuals during weeks or months, depending on the disease and populations considered). We then harness the model to predict the effects of both spillover transmission and direct transmission on the number and the size of outbreaks. Outbreaks occur when the number of cases of disease increases above the epidemiological threshold. In the case of non emerging infectious diseases, an epidemiological threshold is used to gauge the start of outbreaks. For instance for the seasonal influenza the epidemiological threshold is calculated depending on the incidence of the disease during the previous years ( Tay et al., 2013 ) . In the case of emerging infectious diseases, no incidence is normally expected in the population so from a small number of infected individuals, the outbreak can be considered to spread. We show that, regarding the epidemiological dynamics, the recurrent emergence of the pathogen from the reservoir in the incidental host is as important as the transmission between individuals of the incidental host. We conclude by discussing the implications of these results for the classification of pathogens proposed by Lloyd-Smith et al. (2009) .",

The infection is assumed to propagate quickly relatively to other processes such as pathogen evolution and demographic processes. The reservoir is defined as a compartment where the pathogen is persistently maintained, this pathogen is then considered as endemic. The population is fully mixed.

In the incidental host, the infection can propagate by direct contact at rate \u03b2SI where I is the number of infected individuals and \u03b2 is the individual rate of infection transmission. An infected individual can recover at rate \u03b3 . The propensity of the pathogen to be transmitted between individuals within host is expressed in terms of the basic reproductive ratio of the pathogen, R 0 , which is widely used in epidemiology. R 0 corresponds to the average number of secondary infections produced by an infected individual in an otherwise susceptible population. In a deterministic model, for a pathogen to invade the population, R 0 must be larger than 1 in the absence of reservoir. In a stochastic model, the higher the R 0 the higher the probability for the pathogen to invade the population. In a SIR model, the basic reproductive ratio R 0 equals to \u03b2N / \u03b3 . Individuals in the recovered compartment do not contribute anymore to the transmission process. Since we assume that demographic processes are slower than epidemic processes, the number of susceptible individuals decreases during the epidemic due to the consumption of susceptible by the infection until the extinction of the susceptible population. In other words, in our model, R 0 will decrease because of the successive spillovers from the reservoir.

We believe that these approximations are reasonable because the probability for an excursion to reach the threshold decreases with the consumption of susceptible individuals, and as a consequence, most of the outbreaks will occur at the beginning of the process. However, the real \u03c4 opt should be a little bit higher than the one we estimate, to counterbalance the fact that the real infection rates (by the reservoir and the infected individuals) are smaller than the one we use in our calculations.

Here, we build a continuous time stochastic SIR model to consider the statistical process underlying a spillover transmission, i.e. transmission from an animal reservoir to a host. We analyse the model to predict the number and the size of outbreaks as a function of both the spillover transmission and within host. The model shows that spillover transmission influences the epidemiological dynamics as much as the transmission by direct contact between individuals. Three different dynamics are observed, ranging from the absence of outbreaks to a single large outbreak.

Generally, the occurrence of epidemics in humans is attributed to the ability of the pathogen to propagate between individuals. In the case of a single-host process, the notion of the basic reproductive ratio R 0 seems sufficient to evaluate the spread of the pathogen in a population entirely composed of susceptible individuals. In EIDs, R 0 is also used to gauge the risk of pandemics. In this way, Lloyd-Smith et al. (2009) delineate the three stages identified for a zoonotic pathogen ( Wolfe et al., 2007 ) by using the ability of the pathogen to spread between individuals. Each stage corresponds to a specific epidemiological dynamics ranging from a non-contagious pathogen making an outbreak impossible (Stage II, R 0 = 0 ) to a barely contagious pathogen with few outbreaks and stuttering chains of transmission (Stage III, R 0 < 1) to a contagious pathogen making a large outbreak possible (Stage IV, R 0 > 1). The aim of the Wolfe's classification is to establish each stage at which a zoonotic pathogen may evolve to be adapted to human transmission only, in order to identify pathogens at potential risk of pandemics. However, in our model, by taking into account the recurrent emergence of the pathogen from the reservoir, the three dynamics that define the three stages will depend on both the spillover transmission and the direct transmission of the pathogen between individuals. The results suggest that in the case of pathogen spilling recurrently over an incidental host, the direct transmission should not be the only parameter to consider.",

Without transmission from the reservoir, the probability to have an outbreak when the pathogen is barely contagious only depends on the direct transmission between individuals, and the outbreak rapidly goes extinct. By contrast, the results show that the recurrent emergence of the pathogen from a reservoir increases the probability to observe an outbreak. Spillover transmission enhances the probability to both observe longer chains of transmission and reach the epidemiological threshold (i.e. threshold from which an outbreak is considered) even for a pathogen barely contagious. Moreover, this coupling model (reservoir-human transmission) allows the appearance of multiple outbreaks depending on both the ability of the pathogen to propagate in the population and the transmission from the reservoir. Zoonotic pathogens such as MERS, Ebola or Nipah are poorly transmitted between individuals ( R 0 estimated to be less than 1) ( Althaus, 2014; Chowell et al., 2014; Luby et al., 2009; Zumla et al., 2015 ) yet outbreaks of dozens/hundreds/thousands of infected individuals are observed.

For example, a large outbreak is observed either for a high spillover transmission or for a high direct transmission. The proposed stochastic model makes it possible to understand the effects of the infection from the reservoir or from direct transmission on the epidemiological dynamics in an incidental host when empirically this distinction is difficult.

The reservoir can be seen as an ecological system comprising several species or populations in order to maintain the pathogen indefinitely ( Haydon et al., 2002 ) . For example, bat and dromedary camel ( Camelus Dromedarius ) populations are involved in the persistence of MERS-CoV and in the transmission to human populations ( Sabir et al., 2016 ) . In these cases, the assumptions of a constant force of infection can be valid because the pathogen is endemic. However, zoonotic pathogens can spill over multiple incidental hosts and they can infect each other. In the case of the Ebola virus, which infects multiple incidental hosts such as apes, gorillas and monkeys ( Ghazanfar et al., 2015 ) , the principal mode of contamination of the human population is the transmission from non-human primate populations. Moreover, the contact patterns between animals and humans is one of the most important risk factors in the emergence of avian influenza outbreaks ( Meyer et al., 2017 ) . These different epidemiological dynamics with transmission either from the reservoir or from other incidental hosts can largely impact the dynamics of infection observed in the human population, and the investigations of those effects can enhance our understanding of zoonotic pathogens dynamics.",

Let us consider a subcritical branching process with individual birth rate \u03b2N and individual death rate \u03b3 . As this process is subcritical, we know that the excursion will die out in a finite time and produce a finite number of individuals. Then from Britton and Pardoux (2018) or Van Der Hofstad (2016) , if we denote by K [ N, \u03b2, \u03b3 ] the total number of individuals born during the lifetime of this branching process (counting the initial individual), we know that:",

Fig. 4 shows the roles of the direct transmission, R 0 , and the spillover transmission, \u03c4 , in the occurrence of the three patterns depicted in Fig. 3 , in the case of a threshold c = 5 and c = 10 . Stuttering chains of transmission occur when the pathogen is barely contagious between individuals (small R 0 ) and when the recurrent emergence of the pathogen ( \u03c4 ) is low. At the opposite, when the pathogen is highly contagious (large R 0 ) or when the spillover transmission is high ( \u03c4 ), only one large outbreak is observed. Finally, both dynamics (a large outbreak and stuttering chains of transmission) are observed for intermediate value of both direct and spillover transmission. The dynamics observed in the three stages depend both of the value on the direct transmission ( R 0 ) and the effect of the reservoir ( \u03c4 ). The three stages are observed when spillover transmission ( \u03c4 ) or the direct transmission ( R 0 ) is low, two stages appear when direct or spillover transmission is intermediate and only one stage is observed when at least one of the two transmission is high. Hence, both types of transmission are important in the emergence of epidemiological dynamics. Fig. 4 shows that the epidemiological threshold c little affects the observed dynamics. For both values c = 5 and c = 10 , the three patterns are observed. However, the values of both transmissions ( \u03c4 and R 0 ) on the frontiers between stages are different.
