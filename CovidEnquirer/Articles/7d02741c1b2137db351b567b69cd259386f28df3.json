This article tests the extent to which CCG can influence corporate performance of Taiwan's publicly traded hospitality companies. The variable of CCG is defined as the ratio of the total value of corporate giving to total sales revenue. The measures of corporate performance are profitability (return on assets and return on equity), stock performance and Tobin's Q. Panel regression test results reveal that CCG can affect all measures of corporate performance except for stock return. In particular, the impact of CCG on return on assets, return on equity and Tobin's Q is an inverted U-shape, implying that an increased CCG can enhance corporate performance, but as the level of CCG reaches its optimal point, an increase in CCG could have a negative influence on corporate performance. Empirical test results can offer valuable managerial insights for the hospitality industry.",

Why do corporations do this? According to value enhancement theory, CCG creates value for shareholders (Brown et al., 2006; Fry et al., 1982; Navarro, 1988) . Brown et al. (2006) argued that CCG could be viewed as a form of investment to maximize shareholder value by enhancing employee morale, customer loyalty, and preferential treatment by regulators or policymakers. Researchers in finance, management and social science have attempted to identify the effects of CCG on corporate performance (Brammer and Millington, 2008; Lev et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2008) . However, there is no consensus on the effects of CCG on corporate performance (Brammer and Millington, 2008; Wang et al., 2008) .",

(2008) concluded that CCG facilitates stakeholder cooperation and helps secure access to critical resources controlled by those stakeholders, suggesting that CCG should be positively associated with corporate financial performance. In addition, according to the value enhancement theory, CCG can persuade target stakeholders that a firm is socially responsible. Brown et al. (2006) and Navarro (1988) indicated that a positive company image could create the competitive advantages of brand differentiation, stakeholder loyalty and insurance-like protection. These competitive advantages thereby improve operational efficiency, reduce cost and generate profit for shareholders. Consequently, CCG should have a positive impact on corporate performance.",

            "text": "In contrast, CCG could have a negative influence on corporate performance. Based on agency cost theory, CCG may be considered as an additional agency cost generated by the conflict between shareholders and managerial insiders (managers and board directors) over charitable donation (Brown et al., 2006) . When managerial insiders pursue their own interest through discretionary giving, they tend to give more to charity but at the expense of shareholders' interest (Barnett, 2007; Haley, 1991; Wang et al., 2008) . Thus when the managerial insiders have an incentive to use CCG to enhance their own interests, CCG would not benefit the corporation and its shareholders. Instead, it may divert valuable corporate resources and undermine corporate performance. http Nonetheless, some research studies revealed that CCG has a negligible effect on corporate performance. Griffin and Mahon (1997) investigated the relationship between CCG and corporate performance. They found no support for the relationship between CCG and corporate profitability measures (return on asset and return on equity). Berman et al. (1999) also showed that CCG could not significantly affect corporate financial performance measured by return on asset. Similarly, Seifert et al. (2004) showed that CCG could not have a strong effect on corporate stock return. Wang et al. (2008) showed a curvilinear relation between CCG and corporate financial performance. Specifically, they detected an inverted U-shaped relationship between CCG and return on asset, and between CCG and Tobin's Q. In other words, an increased CCG can enhance return on asset and Tobin's Q. However, as the level of CCG reached a certain point, an increase in CCG could have a negative influence on return on asset and on Tobin's Q.",

Several examinations of the effects of CCG on firm performance, on the one hand, have been conducted for developed countries, such as the UK (for example, Brammer and Millington, 2008) and USA (Seifert et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2008; Lev et al., 2010) . No research studies have investigated whether corporate giving affects the corporate performance in an emerging country. Since economic, ethic, social, legal, political and culture factors differ between developed and emerging countries, corporate structure (such as firm characteristics, agency conflicts and business environment) in emerging countries would be different from those in developed countries (Wright et al., 2005; Young et al., 2008) . As Brown et al. (2006) , Navarro (1988) and Wang et al. (2008) noted, agency cost, value-enhancing and other firm-related factors are critical determinants of corporate giving. Given the potential differences in corporate structure across countries that may lead to the diverse giving determinants from country to country, corporate giving and its relative importance would vary across countries (Seifert et al., 2003) . Accordingly, it would be interesting and worthwhile to see if corporate giving also affects corporate financial performance in an emerging country.",

For example, Chen et al. (2005) tested the impact of a set of macroeconomic variables on hotel stock returns in Taiwan. Chen et al. (2007) examined the effect of the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) on Taiwanese hotel stock prices. Chen (2007) studied whether monetary policy changes could affect Taiwanese hotel stock returns. Chen et al. (2012) investigated the impact of insider managerial ownership on financial performance of publicly traded tourist hotels in Taiwan. Although previous hospitality studies have analyzed various financial issues and made different contributions to the research on the hospitality industry in Taiwan, this study can further enrich the hospitality financial literature by examining the impact of CCG on the Taiwanese hospitality firms' performance.",

Specifically, the total value of annual corporate giving of the Taiwanese hospitality industry was approximately NT$ (New Taiwan dollar) 2.70 million in 1996. The total value increased to 6.62 million in 2009, 11.42 million in 2010 and 11.62 million in 2011, an approximately 330.4% growth rate over that 16-year period. According to the Market Observation Post System (http://newmopsov.twse.com.tw/), the total value of CCG made by Taiwanese publicly traded companies was about NT$ 2.80 billion in 2011. This figure represents about 0.28% of all annual pre-taxable profits of all publicly traded companies in Taiwan. The total value of CCG from hospitality companies amounted to approximately NT$ 11.62 million in 2011. The hospitality industry, among 27 industry sectors listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange from 1996 to 2011, was ranked second in terms of the ratio of the total value of CCG to sales revenue, only behind the biotechnology industry (see Fig. 1 ).",

The indicators of corporate performance under consideration are profitability measures (return on assets and return on equity), stock performance and Tobin's Q. Return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) are two of the most popular profitability measures used in the business and finance literature. Stock price, reflecting the earnings prospects of a company, can be used to compute shareholders' return and evaluate financial performance of publicly traded hospitality companies. Tobin's Q is commonly used to measure the intangible asset values of companies.",

The interaction of benefit and cost generated by CCG consequently determines the effects of CCG on corporate performance (Barnett, 2007; Brammer and Millington, 2008; Godfrey, 2005; Lev et al., 2010; Seifert et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2008) .

Similarly, firms may be able to offset some of the pecuniary demands of workers through CCG by offering a greater number of nonpecuniary benefits, and facilitate staff recruitment and retention and improve labor productivity (Brammer and Millington, 2008) . Thus, firms with higher CCG may increase their operating efficiency and decrease operating cost by raising employee morale and productivity, thereby generating higher revenues and profits. Fry et al. (1982) and Lev et al. (2010) contended that a socially responsible image can differentiate a brand and enhance customer loyalty, especially for consumer-focused firms. Bhattacharya and Sen (2003) suggested that CCG may induce customers to increase their demand for the firm's products or services, or their willingness to pay premium prices. Therefore, firms with high CCG differentiated themselves from those with lower CCG to the target consumer and reaped the benefits of consumer loyalty (Brammer and Millington, 2008) . Examining the effect of corporate giving growth on sales growth using a large sample of publicly traded U.S. companies from 1989 through 2000, Lev et al. (2010) identified a positive link between CCG and customer satisfaction and found that CCG is significantly and positively related to future sales revenue.",

Brown et al.

Although CCG contributions, a specific component of corporate social responsibility (CSR), are of growing importance to companies, the studies of CCG remain relatively underdeveloped (Brammer and Millington, 2008; Liket and Simaens, 2013) .

The sample hospitality companies provided required CCG and corporate performance data from 1996 to 2011 (16 years). The total value of corporate giving (CG) at the end of each year is retrieved from the annual statistics of Market Observation Post System (http://newmopsov.twse.com.tw/). Table 1 shows the distribution of the yearly corporate giving. Accounting and financial data at the end of each year for measuring corporate performance are collected from the database of the Taiwan Economic Journal. Consequently, 208 yearly sample observations (13 hospitality companies multiplied by 16 years) are available for the panel regression analysis.",

TQ (Tobin's Q) = (market value of a firm)/(the replacement costs of assets). GSALE = the growth rate of sales and SIZE = the natural logarithm of the total assets. the coefficient of CGR 2 on ROA is significantly negative (positive), it hence indicates that there is an inverted U-shaped (a U-shaped) relationship between CGR and ROA. However, if b 11 (i = 1. . .4) are significantly different from zero (b i1 = 0 is rejected) and b i2 is not significantly different from zero (b i2 = 0 is not rejected), suggesting that the relationship between CGR and corporate performance (ROA, ROE, SR or TQ) is linear, not curvilinear. For example, if b 21 / = 0 and b 22 / = 0, it implies that the significant influence of CGR on ROE is linear, but there is no curvilinear relationship between the two factors.",

Therefore, owners and managerial insiders of the Taiwanese hospitality companies should continue designating a higher proportion of sales revenue for charitable giving. By so doing, the benefits generated from CCG would exceed the cost incurred by CCG. As CCG increases, it can enhance the corporate performance (in terms of ROA, ROE and TQ) of the publicly traded hospitality companies. Second, it is noteworthy that although Taiwanese hospitality companies should have made more donations, this did not imply an unlimited increase in CCG. Specifically, the impact of CCG on ROA, ROE and TQ is an inverted U-shape, implying that CCG has a beneficial effect on corporate performance, but only up to a point, beyond which corporate performance will deteriorate. The publicly traded hospitality companies are advised to increase CCG to a level that is close to the optimal level, thereby maximizing corporate performance.",

The size of the explanatory power of CCG and CCG 2 on TQ is about 1.8 times that of CCG and CCG 2 on ROA and is more than twice that of CCG and CCG 2 on ROE. The finding suggests that CCG and CCG 2 have a major influence on intangible asset value (or future growth opportunity) instead of current profitability performance of the Taiwanese hospitality companies. Simon (1995) argued that CCG should be considered a component of long-term competitiveness, not a short-term image builder and sales generator. Thus, CCG could be viewed as a form of investment in intangible assets with predictably positive effects on corporate performance of hospitality companies. Therefore, hospitality firms would be well advised to develop a multi-period giving strategy.",

One possible explanation is that stock market participants or hospitality stock investors may not consider the act of corporate giving to be an effective strategy to improve corporate performance for hospitality companies. For the two control variables, GSALE has an expected significant impact on corporate performance measures in terms of ROA, ROE and stock return. However, firm size is found to have a significantly negative influence on ROA, ROE and TQ in this study, which is different from the result in Wang et al. (2008) that SIZE has a significantly positive influence on ROA and TQ. This implies that larger hospitality firms in Taiwan are likely to have poor profitability performance and lower intangible asset value (or future growth opportunity). The finding contradicts the arguments by Ben-Zion and Shalit (1975) and Hardwick (1997) that larger firms should have a better performance. Why large hospitality firms in Taiwan have poor corporate performance in terms of ROA, ROE and TQ, and whether poor corporate performance affects CCG decisions of large Taiwanese hospitality firms are questions that merit further investigation.",

Another interesting question is whether hospitality companies with better corporate performance (doing well) are more willing to contribute to CCG (doing good). Roberts (1992) and Ullmann (1985) noted that corporate social behavior was positively related to profitability given that firms with higher profitability because of their excellent management may have more discretionary profit to invest in socially responsible activities. Accordingly, profitable firms are likely to have discretionary funds to contribute to CCG. Future studies can examine whether hospitality companies contribute to CCG because they are doing well.",
