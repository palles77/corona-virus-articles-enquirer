Eight human respiratory viruses circulate commonly in all age groups and are recognized as adapted to efficient person-to-person transmission ( Table 1 ). In addition to these, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and avian influenza virus H5N1 have emerged in recent years as threats to public health. SARS-CoV has been out of circulation since 2003, and avian influenza virus H5N1 has caused limited outbreaks of human infections. As the currently known respiratory viruses still do not account for all clinically relevant human viral respiratory illnesses, systematic searches for new agents using molecular tools are expected to discover previously unidentified agents. Although respiratory viruses cause a great burden of diseases, only a few preventive or therapeutic interventions are currently available. However, recent advances in molecular and cell biology of respiratory viruses will hopefully result in the development of useful interventions. In this article, we focus on the common respiratory viruses, with the exception of influenza virus, covered in a separate article.",

HRSV virions are heterogeneous in size and shape, and consist of a helical nucleocapsid containing a 15 220 nt negative-sense singlestranded RNA, tightly bound to the nucleoprotein (N). The virus particle is surrounded by a lipid bilayer containing the glycoproteins G (receptor binding), F (membrane fusion), and SH (unknown function). The virions also contain an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L), a phosphoprotein (P), and a 22K protein (M2-1) (Figure 1 ).

Later, this separation was confirmed in other genes and phylogenetic analysis of G gene sequences allowed further division of groups into HRSV genotypes. While new genotypes continue to emerge, others that circulated previously tend to disappear. HRSV binds to cell surface glycosaminoglycans through the viral glycoprotein G, although G proteinindependent binding also exists. Upon virus-receptor interaction, fusion of virus and cell membranes takes place through the binding of viral protein F to cell GTPase RhoA. HRSV internalization is considered to be pH-independent and may happen either in plasma or in endosomal membranes. Expression of the viral protein F on the plasma membrane of infected cells promotes fusion between adjacent cells, resulting in the formation of syncytia, the hallmark of paramyxovirus cytopathic effect. Once in the cytoplasm, the negative-strand viral RNA is transcribed by the coordinated action of the proteins L, N, P, and M2-1; resulting in a set of mRNAs, which then direct the synthesis of viral proteins. The transcription of mRNAs occurs in a gradient with decreasing amounts of transcripts being generated from the 39 end to the 59 end of the genome template (Figure 2) . At some point, the polymerase complex switches from mRNA transcription to viral-RNA replication, generating a full-length RNA of polarity opposite to that of the genome (antigenome). Antigenome serves as a template for the polymerase complex to generate negative-sense RNA genomes of the progeny. The viral protein M2-2 seems to alter the polymerase complex in a way that may direct preference of replication over transcription. The viral matrix (M) protein mediates the association of nucleocapsids with lipid rafts containing HRSV envelope proteins in the plasma membrane, giving rise to virus budding. Viral proteins NS1 and NS2 are suppressors of type 1 interferon induction.",

Most children have been infected by HRSV at the age of 2, and reinfections are common throughout life. Annual seasonal outbreaks of HRSV occur in winter/early spring in temperate regions and during rainy seasons in tropical areas, likely because of increased indoor crowding. More than one genotype of HRSV groups A and B cocirculate in the same seasonal outbreak, with the group predominance changing from year to year, with no apparent correlation of group or genotype with clinical manifestations or disease severity. HRSV transmission requires close contact, either by large particle aerosols or by contamination of hands followed by inoculation into the eye or nose, and secondary infections in family contacts of an index case are common.",

Steady accumulation of amino acid changes over time leads to the emergence of new lineages, and therefore HRSV genotypes predominant in an outbreak tend to be replaced by others in subsequent years. This is likely because of the development of herd immunity toward immunodominant epitopes. A mutant HRSV B containing 20 amino acid reduplication in the variable region of the G protein ectodomain was recently identified and made it possible to track the dissemination of novel HRSV strains. This insertion, first detected in Argentina in 1999, was isolated in the following years in Belgium, United Kingdom, Japan, and North America, indicating that a new HRSV strain can spread rapidly worldwide. Remarkably, after a period of 1-2 years, this new variant became the predominant HRSV B strain with further accumulation of variation in the G gene.",

            "text": "HRSV replicates in respiratory epithelia, reaching high titers in nasal secretions and causing virus shedding for up to 3 weeks after the end of symptoms. Cell-to-cell spread leads to involvement of the entire respiratory tree by HRSV, reaching bronchioles 1-3 days after the onset of symptoms, inducing necrosis of ciliated cells, syncytia formation, peribronchiolar inflammation with abundant lymphocytes and macrophages, and impairment of secretion clearance, resulting in small airway obstruction and lung hyperinflation typical of bronchiolitis. HRSV pneumonia with interstitial mononuclear infiltrate, eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions in epithelial cells, and multinucleated giant cells, frequently coexist with bronchiolitis. HRSV disease is particularly severe in young babies, whose immature airways are unable to compensate for the virus-induced damage. Naturally acquired immunity to RSV is incomplete and short-lived, but disease severity is reduced on reinfections. Secretory IgA correlates better with protection than serum antibody level and patient age, and preexisting HRSV-specific maternal antibodies influence the development of disease. Cell-mediated immune response is central to recovery from infection, and immunosuppressed patients are at risk of severe HRSV disease and fatal outcome. The type of immune response to HRSV is a major factor in the development of wheezing and asthma exacerbations. A deviation toward Th2 cytokine response is associated with more severe disease, whereas a Th1 response leads to effective viral clearance and milder illness. A preexisting Th1 deficiency may be associated with severe disease in some children, which may be a marker of predisposition to wheezing and asthma later in life. The HRSV G protein, which is produced both as membrane-anchored and as soluble forms, is a type II glycoprotein with two highly variable extracellular mucin-like domains separated by a cysteine-rich, much conserved central region that inhibits innate immunity and modulates cytokine production. HRSV infection of epithelial cells triggers the release of Th1 cytokines  (IFN-, IL-2, IL-12), Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-6,  IL-10) , IFN-, IFN-, and chemokines that amplify the immune response and inflammatory reaction.",

This was apparently due to the imbalance between protective and immunopathologic T-cell responses elicited by the vaccine that would favor a CD4\u00fe Th2 pattern upon subsequent HRSV infections, whereas a previous natural infection would favor a CD4\u00fe Th1 pattern in response to reinfection. Following a 2-8 days incubation period, HRSV infection causes illness ranging from mild upper respiratory infection (URI) to severe lower respiratory infection (LRI), including pneumonia, bronchiolitis, tracheobronchitis, and croup. In infants and young children, URI is frequently accompanied by otitis media and fever. The most frequent manifestation of LRI due to HRSV in infants is bronchiolitis, which is usually preceded by 2-3 days of symptoms of the upper respiratory tract, and is characterized by tachypnea, dyspnea, cough, expiratory wheezing, air trapping, and in more severe cases, intercostal muscle retractions and cyanosis. Fever is present in 50% of infants, with lung hyperaeration and sometimes segment atelectasis on chest X-ray. Blood count usually shows lymphocytosis, and an increase in neutrophils can be associated with bacterial superinfection. Acute otitis media is found in up to 60% of children with bronchiolitis. Patients with underlying conditions, such as congenital heart disease, prematurity or cystic fibrosis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, as well as immunocompromised hosts of any age, are at risk for severe and fatal HRSV infections.",

HPIV types 1 and 3 are classified in the genus Respirovirus, whereas HPIV types 2 and 4 are in the genus Rubulavirus. The virions are pleomorphic, with single-stranded negativesense RNA, ranging from 150 to 200 nm in diameter ( Figure 1 ). The glycoprotein HN, with hemagglutinin (HE) and neuraminidase activities, promotes virus-cell attachment by binding to sialic acid present on the cell surface proteins. Upon cleavage by proteolytic enzymes, viral protein F mediates the fusion of viral and cell membranes, with consequent release of the nucleocapsid in the cytoplasm. The virus life cycle occurs in a way similar to other Paramyxoviridae ( Figure 2 ). Nonstructural proteins equivalent to M2, NS1, and NS2 of HRSV are not present in HPIV.

HRVs are small, nonenveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses in the family Picornaviridae, genus Rhinovirus, distributed in two species, A (75 serotypes) and B (25 serotypes). Recently described new strains containing deletions in the VP1 region may constitute a new species C. HRV atomic structure was solved and revealed an icosahedral particle composed of 12 pentamers with a diameter of about 30 nm (Figure 3) . Surrounding a fivefold vertex of VP1 capsid proteins from adjacent pentamers, there is a 1.2-3.0 nm wide canyon that contains the receptor binding site for the HRVs of the major receptor group. The HRV genome is a 7.4 kb monocistronic, single-stranded, uncapped RNA, with a small genomic protein (VPg) covalently linked to the 59 end and a poly(A) tail at the 39 end. The first 600-700 nt at the 59 end constitute a highly structured untranslated region (UTR), where an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) permits initiation of translation. Following receptor binding, the viral positive-strand RNA is released into the cytoplasm, and translation of the single ORF produces one polyprotein that is cleaved cotranslationally to generate three precursors -P1 that originates capsid proteins, P2 and P3, originates nonstructural proteins and VPg. Further cleavages of these precursors generate 11 endproducts, and the last cleavage of VP0 into VP2 and VP4 occurs only at the final stages of virus maturation (Figure 4) . One of the P3 cleavage products, 3D, is an RNA-based RNA polymerase that will produce a negative-stranded full-length copy of the genome to be used as a template for the production of an expanding pool of positive-stranded RNAs. The positive-stranded RNAs can be either translated into viral proteins or packaged as genome into newly assembled virions. The HRV replication cycle takes place in association with vesicle membranes in the cytoplasm and mature virions are released upon cell in lysis (Figure 5) .",

The viral genome is 29 727 nt in length, with 14 ORFs coding for 28 putative proteins. It is known that SARS-CoV nsp1 protein increases cellular RNA degradation and thus might facilitate SARS-CoV replication or block immune responses. Trimers of the S protein form the peplomers and bind the cell receptor, being the main target for neutralizing antibodies. M and N proteins of SARS-CoV can induce apoptosis of host cells and may play an important role in pathogenesis. SARS-CoV is phylogenetically different from previously known coronaviruses, but isolates from different origins are relatively similar. Genome analysis reveals that SARS-CoV is neither a host-range mutant nor a recombinant of previously known coronaviruses but rather an independently emerged virus. SARS-CoV seems to have evolved from an animal SARS-like virus, acquiring greater fitness in humans during the course of the outbreaks, probably through the appearance of nucleotide deletions in ORF8.",

Other structural proteins are inserted in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where they are cotranslationally glycosylated and trimerized. The nucleocapsids are then enclosed by these proteins in the ER and transported to the Golgi apparatus. Mature virions are apparently released by exocytosis-like fusion of smooth-walled vesicles with the plasma membrane.",

However, retrospective analysis revealed that cases compatible with this disease had occurred in China, in the province of Guangdong, starting in November 2002. In February 2003, a single infected person spent 1 day at a hotel in Hong Kong and transmitted the virus to 16 other people, who in turn seeded outbreaks of SARS in other countries in Asia and Canada. In a matter of weeks, SARS had affected thousands of people in 25 countries in all continents, causing enormous global impact. SARS-CoV was isolated and characterized in record time after the onset of the 2002-03 outbreak.",

            "text": "Several studies have detected HBoV as the sole virus in association with respiratory symptoms, sometimes with high viral loads, consistent with disease causation. However, HBoV has been frequently detected by PCR in healthy subjects, what may represent shedding of unknown origin. In addition to this, the lack of culture system and animal models makes it difficult to fulfill Koch's postulates and even molecular causality criteria. Case-control studies have found significant difference in the prevalence of HBoV in patients with ARI as compared to healthy controls. However, up to 76% of patients with detectable HBoV also shed other respiratory viruses at the same time.Parvoviruses require proliferating cells for their replication and animal bocaviruses infect respiratory and intestinal epithelium, and lymphoid organs. The sites of HBoV replication have not been determined, but the virus is apparently not confined to the respiratory tract, since it has been detected in stools and serum, suggesting systemic infection. Importantly, HBoV can be found in 45% of the stool samples from patients with respiratory symptoms. This, however, is not enough to support a role of HBoV as an agent of gastroenteritis.Even though HBoV's causative role in disease remains to be confirmed, the agent has been detected in association with URI symptoms, including cough, rhinitis, and fever, as well as in patients with bronchitis, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and asthma exacerbation. The range of clinical symptoms is similar to that observed for HRSV and HMPV infections, and the patient may remain symptomatic for 1-2 weeks. Acute otitis media may be present in 42% and gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported in up to 25% of patients.",
