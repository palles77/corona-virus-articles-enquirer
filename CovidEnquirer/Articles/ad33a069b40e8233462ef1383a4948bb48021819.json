Figure 4 .1 shows a life cycle diagram of the cleaning process. In a typical surface cleaning application, a cleaning fluid containing a strong surfactant/degreaser contacts the contaminated surface. The surfactant reduces the interfacial tension between the contaminant and the part surface, and separates the contaminants from the surface. A combination of microbes and nutrients is released into (and now living in) the fluid. Nutrients are generally added as part of the cleaning mix to provide emerging microbes with fortification until sufficient amounts of oil and grease have been introduced as carbon sources. The microbes secrete natural enzymes (for example, In parts cleaners, the cleaning action is due to the surfactant, not the microbes. However, while the microbes do not participate in surface contaminant removal, over time they will remove any hydrocarbons in the cleaning system. In a conducive, nutrient-rich environment, the bioremediation materials continue to manufacture themselves throughout the contaminated solution, increasing the overall biomass of microbes in an exponential manner until all the available hydrocarbons are consumed, thus leaving a clean system with a hydrocarbon-free cleaning solution. Bacteria multiply very rapidly. A single cell can grow to 10 21 within 24 h [22] . The clean solution can be recirculated through the system, the cleaning cycle is repeated, and there is no interruption in the cleaning process.",

Typically, a biocatalyst contains a combination of nonionic surfactants and emulsifiers and water, as well as nutrients that are essential to microbial life. The combination of surfactants and emulsifiers acts to break up the hydrocarbon into very small globules to bring it into intimate contact with the microbes. The globules are surrounded by the enzymes, thereby increasing the rate at which they are dissociated and subsequently digested. The biocatalyst significantly increases bioavailable oxygen. This provides a catalyst for the microbes to multiply faster, resulting in more rapid, more complete bioremediation.

Figure 4. 2 shows examples of free-standing microbial parts cleaning units [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Typically, these heated cleaning systems consist of an upper sink and a lower tank, filter assemblies to trap visible particulate matter (for example, sand, grit, dirt and paint chips), power module, onboard diagnostics, recirculating pumps, cleaning nozzles, and a tank aeration system that increases the effectiveness of the microbes. Higher pump pressure also improves the cleaning action. The load capacity of these systems ranges from 20 to 200 kg of parts. These units are best for light-duty manual cleaning of parts similar to conventional solvent sink-top units, although recently a larger capacity system has been introduced for cleaning entire bicycles [31] . This model includes an integrated bike stand with the parts washer.",

In the first year, the Guard eliminated 600 gallons of solvent waste and significantly reduced volatile organic compound emissions, saved $5130 in waste disposal manifesting requirements, and saved $4200 in yearly solvent purchase costs. The estimated payback period was about 18 months. A major aeronautical firm realized savings of more than $80,000 by reducing solvent usage by more than 900 gallons during the first year through use of 23 bioremediation parts washers to replace solvent cleaners [9] . Other studies have shown annual cost savings of nearly 40% by replacing solvent cleaning units with an aqueous cleaner and a microbial cleaning unit with an average payback period of 1.5 years, although in one case, the payback period was <3 months [10, 68] . Table 4 .1 compares the cost of microbial cleaning with solvent cleaning. The total costs include equipment, cleaning solutions and chemicals, and waste disposal. The subsequent yearly cost for microbial cleaning is slightly higher than the first year which can be attributed to the cost of replenishment of the cleaning solution.",

Bioremediation eliminates the need for transportation of spent solvents and other hazardous materials. 4. Microbial cleaning is more economical than traditional solvent cleaning technologies. 5. Cleaning is performed under benign operating conditions with minimal energy input to maintain slightly warmer than ambient temperatures. 6. Microorganisms are nonpathogenic, are completely safe to use and have no recognized hazard potential under ordinary conditions of handling. 7. The rate at which microbes can digest hydrocarbons can approach 80% every 7 days. 8. Most bioremediation parts washers can handle large, tough, dirty jobs. 9. Parts are usually cleaned in the first pass. Even the tiniest crevices and tight spaces in contaminated parts are cleaned because the microbes have close and unhindered contact with the parts. 10. Parts are always exposed to clean solution because the microbes constantly clean the solution and keep the bath clean. 11. Microbes improve the cleaning ability of the cleaning solution. The bioremediation process that takes place in the solution frees the surfactants allowing them to clean and emulsify even more contaminants. 12. Microbes have been successfully used on a variety of contaminants ranging from crude oil to hydrocarbon films. 13. Energy usage is low because of low operating temperature of the process. 14. The process operating costs are low.",

Debridement is the surgical excision or enzymatic cleaning of dead, devitalized, or contaminated tissue and removal of foreign matter from a wound to enable healing [82] . These systems are based on the use of pressurized fluid jets to penetrate the skin for delivery and removal of the cleaning solution; a negative-pressure thermotherapeutic fluid delivery device attached to the wound area; pad or dressing with a single or multiple infusion and drainage tubes for continuous delivery of the cleaning solution; or a spray system based on supersonic gas-liquid technology.

One reason for the spread of infection is incomplete or ineffective disinfection of surfaces. Many viruses, bacteria and other pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), are resistant to existing conventional surface cleaning agents/disinfectants. A new antibacterial cleaning composition has been developed that contains different enzymes (proteolytic, amylolytic, lipolytic, or cellulolytic, or their mixtures) and microbes (Bacillus or Pseudomonas) together with a surfactant and an aqueous carrier to maintain a minimum 95% catalytic activity at the pH range of 5.5-13.5 [19] . This solution is effective against several resistant bacterial strains, such as MRSA, vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, and glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus, and can be used as a cleaning and disinfecting agent in affected areas. It can also be used for killing or inactivating bacteria, viruses, or fungi to prevent spreading of the contaminants. Variations of this composition can be used for cleaning metal, ceramic, glass, or plastic parts, concrete and tile floors, cleaning grease traps, and other household cleaning applications. The contaminants that can be removed include carbon deposits, oil, grease, carbohydrates, starch, and meat and dairy products.",

Similarly, removal of body fluids, tissue, residual organic matter, and biofilm is critical to ensure proper cleaning and subsequent high-level disinfection. In general, these detergent formulations offer faster cleaning cycles at lower temperatures, cost savings by extending the lifetime of the instruments, and reduced risk of infections through in-depth cleaning prior to high-level disinfection/ sterilization [65] .",

Exposure to the outdoor environment or to uncontrolled indoor environments (temperature and relative humidity) leads to deterioration largely due to atmospheric pollution from a variety of contaminants. Deterioration is a complex process involving chemical, physical, and biological mechanisms. For example, black salt crusts form on stone surfaces as a result of the chemical and microbial interactions between the atmospheric contaminants (sulfur dioxide forming sulfuric acid), the stone (calcium carbonate reacting with sulfuric acid to form calcium sulfate), and microbes that can form calcium oxalate in the crusts. Dust and dirt combine with the calcium sulfate and oxalate, resulting in the black crust. Several microbial techniques have been proposed and successfully demonstrated for cleaning and restoration of stone buildings, frescoes, marble surfaces, and other objects [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] [95] [96] [97] .
