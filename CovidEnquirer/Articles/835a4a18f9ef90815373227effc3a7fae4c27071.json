            "text": "AHF often leads to worsening renal and hepatic function. Cardiorenal syndrome and hepatic congestion can rapidly progress to irreversible stages. While no single test is an optimal predictor of recovery following heart transplantation, current guidelines recommend assessing renal function using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or creatinine clearance. Evaluation often includes 24-hour proteinuria assessment, renal ultrasonography, and consultation with a nephrologist. The liver is more challenging than the kidney to predict degree of irreversible damage. Screening tools such as assessment of hepatic synthetic function (e.g., international normalized ratio [INR] , platelets, albumin) are often misleading. Imaging of the liver, including abdominal ultrasound and abdominal computed tomography (CT), can often yield inconsistent results. The liver biopsy is being debated as a gold standard. Optimal liver biopsy specimens still have up to a 25% rate of discordance for fibrosis staging and an inherent risk of sampling bias. 11 Newer imaging techniques-such as ultrasound elastography/fibroscan, perfusion imaging with CT, and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) may improve disease assessment. Transplantation candidates with marginal hepatic and renal function are not only at risk during the perioperative period but have higher long-term morbidity and mortality. the administration of intravenous nitroprusside or an inotropic agent), it can safely be assumed that these abnormalities are secondary to the marked degree of cardiac dysfunction. Many AHF centers use indwelling PA catheters to allow for inpatient hemodynamic optimization. Select patients with severe cardiac dysfunction may require temporary MCS (tMCS) to fully unload the LV and allow for optimization of hemodynamics. This strategy may improve patient selection for durable MCS and, ultimately, patient outcomes. Durable MCS has been successful in lowering LV filling pressures over months, leading to negative remodeling. This strategy may provide marginal candidates the opportunity to become acceptable for heart transplantation. RHC should be routinely performed on patients based on risk factors and the clinical severity of disease in those who are being considered for heart transplantation. During episodes of decompensation or if patients are found to have unacceptably high PA pressures, admission to the CICU with PA catheter placement for medical optimization can be very helpful prior to transplantation. Young donor hearts with a na\u00efve right ventricle (RV) have limited exposure to elevated pulmonary pressures and are at high risk for acute RV failure when transplanted into individuals with pulmonary hypertension. Patients with irreversible pulmonary hypertension may be considered for combined heart-lung transplantation.",

The critical importance of immunosuppression immediately postoperatively leaves little room for error. It is routine to consult with an infectious disease specialist prior to transplantation if there are any active infectious concerns. Inpatient transplant candidates are particularly at risk for the development of a nosocomial infection. Meticulous attention to ongoing indications for indwelling lines or Foley catheters can help to avoid preventable infections. Practicing consistent sterile precautions while performing line maintenance can help prevent catheter-related infections. Using a very low threshold at the first sign of fever or leukocytosis to initiate a thorough investigation is recommended. At times, it is necessary to defer a patient's candidacy or downgrade a patient's listing status. An extensive infectious workup is performed on all potential transplant candidates. Finally, a thorough dental examination should be conducted before listing to identify patients with poor dentition and subclinical sources of infection. It is also important to recognize that patients who test positive for cytomegalovirus, Toxoplasma gondii, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or prior tuberculosis (TB) infections can still be considered for heart transplantation.

These strategies should have been used earlier in the course of the disease, but in a recent review 34 of over 1000 consecutive patients listed for heart transplant, only 51% of the patients had an ICD in place at the time of being listed. Patients who suffer decompensation due to arrhythmia may benefit from an electrophysiology evaluation. Options include ablative procedures, optimization of antidysrhythmic regimens, and, in some cases, surgical sympathectomy to treat potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias. If loss of sinus rhythm is thought to have been a precipitant of the decompensation, a robust attempt should be made to establish and maintain sinus rhythm.

Decongesting a patient may afford the opportunity to reinitiate GDMT, but previously ineffective doses may result in effective or even excessive vasodilation. Although it is common for the initiation of GDMT to lead to a rise in creatinine, diuretics should not be withheld. Many effectively treated patients will experience an increase in creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, often by as much as 50%, which is acceptable. One strategy to deal with worsening renal function is to slow the rate of diuresis if the patient is no longer volume overloaded and to avoid excessive vasodilation.

In general, the adverse effects of these medications are duration dependent and dose dependent; combining agents at lower doses may help avoid adverse events. Patient dependence upon continuous IV inotropic support is a poor prognostic indicator and signals the very final stages of AHF. The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) status listing acknowledges the increased morbidity and mortality associated with continuous IV inotropes; thus these patients are given higher priority on the waiting list. Caution must be exerted when transitioning off inotropic support. Patients frequently become overly sensitive to afterload reduction in the setting of intravascular depletion or while titrating down inotropic support. Therefore, special attention should be given to assessing the patient's volume status and tolerance of vasodilators. The advances have made the role of tMCS increasingly important. It is common for patients who are failing intravenous inotropic agents to undergo placement of an intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) or tMCS as a temporizing measure to determine if a patient can be successfully bridged to a more long-term solution (heart transplantation or durable MCS).

In the immediate postoperative period, the transplanted heart usually requires higher-than-normal filling pressures. PA catheters play a critical role in targeting optimal filling pressures for every posttransplant patient. In general, optimal right-sided preload is usually a right atrial pressure between 8 and 15 mm Hg and optimal left-sided preload is a pulmonary capillary wedge of 15 to 20 mm Hg. The elevated filling pressures are thought to be driven by the dramatic decrease in ventricular compliance and diastolic dysfunction after transplantation. Given the degree of diastolic dysfunction and limited stroke volume following heart transplantation, a heart rate of 100 to 120 beats/min is targeted to maintain optimal cardiac output. role for PA catheter-guided management of hemodynamics with special attention to the SVR can help avoid this clinical scenario. Renal vascular vasodilation and renal vascular congestion can both lead to a rise in serum creatinine. Anticipating and differentiating between these events can help prevent patient mismanagement. \"Start low and go slow\" is an appropriate strategy when it comes to oral vasodilator dosing prior to discontinuation of inotropic therapy. In the clinical scenario in which inotropic weaning is unsuccessful, a plan for palliative care, bridge to MCS, or bridge to transplantation should be put in place. When a patient is discharged on inotropic support that is not palliative, ICD placement should be considered given the increased risk for arrhythmia-related, sudden cardiac death.",

In most younger donor hearts, the RV is na\u00efve to elevated PA pressures and is, therefore, susceptible to acute RV failure at time of implantation into a recipient with pulmonary hypertension. This principal was demonstrated in animal models in the 1950s by Guyton et al. 55 Several early posttransplant deaths in the 1960s were attributed to acute RV failure in patients with known pulmonary hypertension. In the 1970s, the risk of death from acute RV failure following heart transplantation was reported by Griepp et al. 56 See Box 48.7 for goals in the treatment of acute RV failure adapted from Stobierska-Dzierzek et al. 57 RV failure is characterized by progressive congestive symptoms with impaired RV filling and/or reduced cardiac output. Increased RV afterload or preload leads to ventricular dilatation diminished by efferent denervation, resulting in an elevated resting heart rate and decreased inotropic and chronotropic responses to exercise. Normal sinoatrial (SA) node activity is often impaired after heart transplantation. Initially, many patients suffer from relative sinus bradycardia. This is often a result of trauma to the SA node following surgery, prolonged ischemic time, or amiodarone use in the recipient prior to heart transplantation. This is often treated with temporary cardiac pacing through surgically placed epicardial pacing wires. Terbutaline has been used with mixed results to temporarily increase resting heart rates following weaning from inotropes. Most patients are able to discontinue terbutaline within the first month after transplant; less than 5% of patients will require pacemaker implantation.",

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is commonly encountered in the CICU following heart transplantation. Over 30% of patients develop clinically significant AKI following cardiac surgery. 60 The pathophysiology of AKI following cardiac surgery is multifactorial, including, but not limited to, cellular ischemia leading to tubular and vascular endothelial injury, loss of autoregulation of glomerular filtration rate at and tricuspid valve insufficiency. Patients who are bridged to heart transplant with MCS are at increased risk for perioperative RV failure because of the technically more challenging surgical approach, increased blood product requirements, and prolonged ischemic time. Focal cardiac tamponade, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and the presence of pulmonary hypertension can all cause acute RV failure. The failing RV often results in worsening venous congestion and subsequent renal, hepatic, and intestinal dysfunction. Treatment of RV failure includes volume optimization, inotropic support, afterload reduction, and mechanical circulatory support. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is commonly used postoperatively for heart transplant patients with elevated pulmonary pressures and RV dysfunction. The normal dose of iNO is 20 to 40 ppm and is typically weaned off prior to extubation. iNO can be very effective in the short term but has limitations with longer-term use.

Preservation of kidney function and maintenance of adequate urine output is one of the most critical jobs of the cardiac intensivist. In the setting of escalating dosages of diuretics, there may be a role for short-term nesiritide to promote diuresis and maintain urine output. Intensivists must avoid nephrotoxic medications, prevent hypotensive episodes, and maintain euvolemia to help ensure successful recovery of kidney function following heart transplantation. Preservation of kidney function allows for optimization of immunosuppression and enhances graft survival. Despite best efforts, transplant patients may require continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) or even intermittent hemodialysis (IHD). Most patients will regain renal function within 6 months.

When targeted appropriately, the adaptive immune system helps to preserve human life. If inappropriately targeted, it can lead to the demise of an individual and a transplanted organ. The amplification of the immune system begins at the moment of the first surgical incision. Tissue factors trigger the upregulation of cytokines that increase the production of both cellular and humoral components of the immune system. The immune system becomes primed to target and destroy anything foreign. Even the most identical donor/ recipient matched organ carries the risk for rejection for the life of the recipient. A recipient's immune system will constantly survey the donor heart for markers (antigens) that would identify it as foreign. The strategy adopted by most transplant centers is early use of multiple drugs that sequentially and synergistically decrease the chance of rejection while attempting to reduce the overall toxicity and side effects of the medications. Immunosuppression may be divided into \"early\" and \"maintenance\" immunosuppression. Early immunosuppression refers to therapeutics used at the time of transplantation. Maintenance immunosuppression is often started within hours of heart transplantation but is continued long term.

CAV occurs along a spectrum but continues to be a leading cause of long-term mortality beyond the first postoperative year. 63 The development of CAV within the first 12 months confers a much higher mortality compared to individuals with no evidence of CAV. Early CAV is typically a diffuse process, affecting the distal vessels in the coronary vascular bed with little hope for successful intervention. Late development of CAV is much more likely to involve the proximal vessels and to be focal in nature. The pathophysiology suggests that both acute and chronic rejection play a significant role in the development of CAV. While many programs have various prophylactic regimens for CAV, the guidelines provide class I recommendations only for statin therapy and strict control of cardiovascular risk factors. 62 The treatment of CAV with percutaneous intervention and, in rare situations, coronary bypass surgery is largely dependent on lesion location and length. Treatment beyond revascularization includes optimization of immunosuppression and the use of PSIs.

Although bacteremia is common, the mortality in this population is not higher than in the nontransplant population, likely due to the increased vigilance resulting in earlier identification and the blunted host inflammatory response. 64, 65 Recent health care contact and antibiotic exposure influences the likelihood of resistant gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycinresistant enterococcus (VRE), and resistant gram negatives such as Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter. VRE infrequently causes severe illness; broad spectrum antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and a \u03b2-lactam agent with antipseudomonal activity should be considered to be first-line treatment. If the local microbiology has a high percentage of extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL) producers, consideration should be given to a carbapenem as the \u03b2-lactam.

Immunosuppressive drugs decrease the risk of rejection and treat established rejection, but at a price. 66 Starting in years 2 to 3 following transplantation, the incidence of malignancy begins to increase; by year 5, it becomes the leading cause of death. Studies have demonstrated a 2-to 4-fold increase in the incidence of malignancy in heart transplant patients compared to kidney transplant recipients. This likely represents the difference in the degree of immunosuppression required to prevent rejection in the heart and the kidney. The current strategy includes the transition from CNIs and antimetabolites to the use of a PSI, which has been demonstrated to reduce both the incidence and progression of malignancy.",

Any decrease in cardiac function, whether accompanied by symptoms or not, must be taken seriously and thoroughly evaluated. There are two major causes of decreased cardiac function after transplant: cardiac allograft rejection and cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Patients suffering from acute rejection present with a wide variety of symptoms and clinical findings. If rejection is suspected, aggressive treatment should be initiated as soon as possible, as these patients can quickly decompensate. The gold standard for diagnosing rejection is an endomyocardial biopsy but the sensitivity is limited and results may not be confirmed for up to 72 hours. Waiting for the tissue diagnosis in this patient population before treating is discouraged, as patients may die from a potentially treatable rejection episode.",

Identification of biomarkers allowing for earlier detection of rejection are actively being developed. Improved techniques to optimize donor-recipient immunologic matching to help further reduce the risk of rejection are showing significant promise.
