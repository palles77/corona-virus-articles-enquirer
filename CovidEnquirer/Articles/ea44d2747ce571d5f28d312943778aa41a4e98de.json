Since the main limitation of the rubella HIG test seems to be its inability to detect rubella-specific immunoglobulin M antibodies, and seeing that after chemical linkage stereometric changes may occur in the erythrocyte membrane, we have attempted to detect rubella IgM antibodies in the HIG test after treatment of the erythrocytes with different coupling reagents.",

Our results show that introducing different coupling techniques used in passive hemagglutination confers no advantage in the rubella HIG test. This is in agreement with Klingeborn and Dinter (1978) who attached the antigen by chromic cation for the HIG test with the equid herpes virus 1 (EHV 1) and found no difference. Rubella IgM antibodies are not active in the HIG test with chemical linkage. The fact that IgM antibodies to viral antigens do not usually fix complement (Schneweis et al., 1974) may explain this.",
