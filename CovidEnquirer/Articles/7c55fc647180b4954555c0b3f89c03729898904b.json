During a normal swallow, fluid and food are propelled caudally into the oropharynx and through the upper esophageal sphincter by contraction of the oral cavity, pharynx, and tongue. Concurrently, the epiglottis retracts to cover the laryngeal aditus and protect the trachea from particulate inhalation. In addition, adduction of the arytenoid cartilages contributes to further occlusion of the upper airways. Any process impeding these primary defenses or inhibiting normal swallowing reflexes greatly enhances the likelihood of aspiration.",

Irritation induced by acid inhalation promotes a local environment in which bacterial colonization can develop and lead to bacterial pneumonia. 4 The severity of disease varies depending on the quantity and nature of the material aspirated as well as the length of time between the event and diagnosis. Conscious animals with intact airway reflexes tend to cough and prevent massive aspiration injury. Animals under anesthesia or with reduced airway reflexes caused by neurologic disorders are less likely to cough in response to the aspiration event and are, therefore, more likely to develop diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and serious lung injury. In many instances, aspiration injuries occur under general anesthesia and it should be noted that the presence of a cuffed endotracheal tube does not prevent inadvertent aspiration. ",

In addition, sonographic evaluation can be useful in the detection of superficial foxtail foreign bodies when they remain in the periphery of the lobe (Figs. 3 and 4) . 12 CT provides greater detail and resolution of lesions within the pulmonary parenchyma and gives clinicians better spatial information regarding the severity and extent of pulmonary involvement.

Repeating the CT in a different position after providing several maximal inspirations can alleviate atelectasis. Nuclear scintigraphy can be useful for the evaluation of ciliary dyskinesia, although secondary causes of mucociliary stasis (eg, infection with Mycoplasma or Bordetella, exposure to smoke) must be excluded before assuming the diagnosis of PCD.

Ideally, antimicrobial choices should be based on culture and sensitivity results from airway lavage samples because resistance to antimicrobials selected empirically has been reported in up to 26% of cases. 28 For critically ill animals in which airways samples cannot be obtained, blood cultures might be considered, although there is a lack of data on sensitivity in veterinary patients. Regardless, in cases of severe pneumonia, initial empiric therapy should be instituted while awaiting culture results. Traditionally, antimicrobials have been administered for 3 to 6 weeks, and at least 1 to 2 weeks beyond the resolution of clinical and/or radiographic signs of disease, although there is no evidence to support this practice. ISCAID recommendations suggest that shorter durations might be appropriate, but there are few data to support this suggestion. One observational study found similar radiographic and clinical cures in dogs treated with a short course of antibiotic (<14 days) compared with those that received a longer duration of treatment. 29 Regardless of the intended duration of therapy, reevaluation within 10 to 14 days of starting treatment is important to determine response and to define optimal length of treatment. Animals with more advanced disease require more intensive care, including hospitalization with intravenous fluids to maintain hydration. Adequate hydration is essential to facilitate clearance of respiratory exudates. Nebulization to create liquid particles that enter the lower airways (<5 mm) can also enhance clearance of secretions. Nebulizer types include ultrasonic devices, compressed air nebulizers, and mesh nebulizers. Nebulization with sterile saline can be achieved by directing the hosing from the nebulizer into a cage or animal carrier covered in plastic. Depending on how viscous secretions are, therapy can be provided for 15 to 20 minutes 2 to 4 times daily. In many cases, nebulization coupled with coupage can help the animal expectorate airway secretions, although no specific studies in veterinary medicine have evaluated this technique. Coupage is performed by cupping the hands and gently, rhythmically pounding on both lateral thoracic walls in a dorsal to ventral and caudal to cranial direction. Coupage should not be performed in animals with regurgitation because any increase in intrathoracic pressure could exacerbate regurgitation and subsequent reaspiration.",

The larynx seemed to have normal function at anesthetic induction. Bronchoscopy revealed mild to moderate dynamic lower airway collapse and bronchiectasis of caudodorsal bronchi along with airway exudate. BAL samples were hypercellular on cytology (2500 cells/mL) and revealed septic suppurative inflammation (55%, normal 5%-8%) with degenerate neutrophils.

In this case, chronic inflammatory airway disease likely contributed to the dog's bronchiectasis, which then predisposed to bronchopneumonia.",
