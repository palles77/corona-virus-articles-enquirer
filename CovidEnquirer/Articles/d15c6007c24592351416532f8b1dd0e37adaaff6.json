Those who received formal education demonstrated that they acquired greater knowledge of the sources and precautionary measures for SARS. The types of precautionary measures used and the factors affecting their behaviours were discussed. The results of the study could help the health-care professionals develop appropriate health promotion and disease prevention programmes for older adults. r",

It gained to public awareness through the Hong Kong news media on 10 February 2003 as an atypical pneumonia outbreak in a nearby province (Guangdong) in Southeastern Mainland China. The outbreak began in Hong Kong on 21 February 2003, when an infected professor from Mainland China (the index case) arrived with his wife; they stayed in a local hotel (HKSARSEC, 2003) . One day after his arrival, he was admitted to a hospital in Hong Kong with severe pneumonia and subsequently died. This hotel was later identified as the original Hong Kong site from which local and international (Hanoi, Singapore, and Toronto) transmission occurred (HKSAR-SEC, 2003) . The first hospital outbreak began on 10 March 2003 when 11 healthcare staff was reported on sick leave from a public hospital. Outbreaks in other hospitals and a housing complex were also identified in April. (Major events in the SARS epidemic were summarized in Table 1 (HKSARSEC, 2003) . Over the course of the outbreak, 1755 cases were reported including 300 deaths. Adults 65 years of age or older were 17.6% of the SARS cases; however, 63.9% of the deaths were within this age demographic and 78.2% of the deaths in this population were persons with a history of chronic illnesses (The University of Hong Kong Clinical Trial Centre (HKUCTC), 26 October 2003) .",

Approximately 11.1% (n=747,052) of the total population is aged 65 years old or above (HKCSD, 26 October 2001a) . This situation presents many challenges for health promotion and disease prevention activities, as many of the usual methods of disseminating health information are not appropriate for this population. In Hong Kong, older adults can receive primary health care in both public and private health sectors. In the public sector there are two choices, the Elderly Health Services or the General Outpatient Clinics, both of which provide low-cost government subsidized services and both may be used concurrently. The Department of Health operates the Elderly Health Services, which provides primary health care and health promotion for older adults once they enroll (HKDH, 2001) . The annual enrolment fee is HK$110 (i.e. US$14.10/UKd 10.00) and curative services cost HK$45 (i.e., US$5.77/UKd 4.09) per consultation. Older adults may also go to the Hospital Authority's General Outpatient Clinic (GOPC) for medical advice and treatment (Hong Kong Hospital Authority, n.d.) . At the GOPC, the treatments including X-rays and laboratory cost HK$45 (i.e. US$5.77/UKd 4.09) and medications cost only HK$10 (i.e. US$1.28/UKd 0.91).

The presence of functional impairments resulting from chronic illnesses or knowledge deficits due to low literacy levels may have influenced what older adults were able to do to comply with the recommended infection control measures. Thus, great concern about older adults living alone was expressed by health care providers and in the media (Kong, 2003) . Older adults, who may not have reacted promptly and appropriately to the Government's recommendations to prevent the transmission of SARS, could have been at higher risk for contracting SARS and potentially for presenting a higher risk of transmission to others.

Three of the questions asked were about hand washing behaviours (after sneezing/coughing, after touching possibly contaminated materials and the use of liquid soap instead of bar soap). The remaining three items asked about behaviours that are traditionally practised in Hong Kong, which required some alternation to avoid spread of SARS. For example, sharing dishes at meals is common in the Chinese culture. Use serving spoon or chopsticks, rather than each individual each using their own chopsticks to take food from commonly shared dishes was recommended as a precautionary measure, but is not widely used (HKDH, 29 November, 2003) . Another common practice is to leave the toilet seat up while flushing; however, contact with urine or feaces is one of the transmission routes, so lowering the toilet cover before flushing may prevent contaminated water from splashing out (HKDH, 29 November, 2003) . Thirdly, a common serving towel is often used during meals and this practice may also transmit the disease. A 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (always) to 4 (none) and a choice of ''do not know'' was added for the participants who did not know how to answer the questions.",

Throughout the outbreak, the main route of transmission was a direct contact of the mucous membrane (eyes, nose, and mouth) with infectious respiratory droplets (Weekly epidemiological record, 24 October, 2003) . Under certain circumstances, contact with urine or feaces was also reported as another route of transmission. The public awareness about the ''fecal droplet'' as a transmission route of SARS was increased after the community outbreak in a private housing complex in Hong Kong (Inadequate plumbing systems, 26 September, 2003) . The WHO technical consultation concluded that inadequate plumbing systems also contributed to the spread of infectious diseases (Inadequate plumbing systems, 26 September, 2003) . Therefore, it was essential to maintain good plumbing systems and take appropriate precautionary measures such as to lower the toilet lid before flushing. However, insufficient knowledge about transmission route of SARS may have affected participants' awareness of adequate precautionary measures. This was evidenced by more than half of the participants reporting that they did not lower the toilet lid before flushing. Although feacal droplet transmission has been less commonly identified as the main transmission route among the infected cases when compared with respiratory droplet transmission (The University of Hong Kong, n.d.) , insufficient knowledge among the older adults could have led to a higher risk of contracting SARS. It is important for those who develop public health messages during crisis situations, such as the one SARS presented in Hong Kong, to identify vulnerable populations that may not be literate and to target health promotion messages in appropriate methods, which have a high probability of reaching these populations.",

Confidence in their physicians was expressed by over half of the participants. The rate of participants answering 'do not know' was high for all three questions in this section of the survey.

Older adults, who are socially isolated or those who have low literacy rates, require health professionals to use alternative methods of dissemination of essential information; for example, inperson out-reach activities to district social services settings rather than relying on broadcast media.",

However, smaller scale descriptive studies also need to be undertaken during these times to provide the needed insights concerning vulnerable populations (e.g., who is least likely to be knowledgeable) and culture-specific information (e.g., use of serving spoons/chopsticks). It is important that nurses become involved in this type of research because of the perspective they bring and that this type of research is conducted while people are still experiencing the crisis. These studies can provide nurses direction for planning and implementing appropriate health promotion and education programmes for older adults.",

The convenience sample recruited from only one district in Hong Kong, limited the external validity of the findings among the older adult population. Data were collected by phone interview, leaving the possibility that older adults who did not have phones may have different responses on study instruments. Other variables such as social network that may have influenced older adults' beliefs or possibility of contracting SARS were not included. A more representative and randomly chosen sample with the use of alternate data collection method (e.g. mailing, face-to-face interview) in future studies would improve the generalizability of findings. The telephone survey was used with content and face validity which was established by an expert panel; now that it has been used, some modifications could be made, which might clarify the participants' response so that fewer 'do not know' responses would occur. Also, it is possible that the students collecting the data could have altered the study protocol causing some inaccuracy in the data unknown to the researchers.",
