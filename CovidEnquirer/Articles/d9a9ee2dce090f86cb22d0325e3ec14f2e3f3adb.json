Originally discovered in Africa in 1947 [1] , ZIKV became an epidemic 60 years later, reaching several tropical regions of the Americas, Africa and Asia. Despite causing mild symptoms such as fever, rashes and conjunctivitis, the major concern about ZIKV regards the severe neurological disorders, such as microcephaly, craniofacial disproportion, spasticity, seizures, irritability and other brainstem dysfunctions [2, 3] . In 2016, infant head computed tomographic findings, of subjects infected during pregnancy, confirmed the causal relationship between microcephaly and Zika infection [3] . A recent study by Yuan and co-workers demonstrated that a single mutation (S139N) in the pre-membrane (prM) structural protein increased ZIKV infectivity in neural progenitor cells (NPCs), making the virus more virulent [4] . This mutation arose in the French Polynesia strain, and it has contributed to the increased incidence of microcephaly and higher mortality in neonates, according to experimental assays [4] . The disorders attributed to Zika infection mainly affect infants but can also impact adults. There have been ZIKV-related cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome [5] , myelitis [6] , uveitis [7] and meningoencephalitis [8] reported in adults.",

Belonging to the genus Flavivirus of the Scheme of Zika virus (ZIKV) surface, structural and nonstructural proteins. (a) Surface-shaded depth cued representation of mature ZIKV (built using UCSF Chimera package [171] , http://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimera, based on PDB ID 5IRE), showing the icosahedral-like symmetry arrangement of surface proteins. (b) Virion components, highlighting the E, M and C proteins, as well as genomic RNA. ZIKV encodes a large polyprotein, which after processing yields three structural proteins (C, M and E) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1; NS2A; NS2B; NS3 protease and helicase domains; NS4A; NS4B; NS5 methyltransferase and RNA polymerase domains), built using the VMD program [172] (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/). NS5 domains are represented separately, as two distinct targets, but NS5 methyltransferase is attached to the NS5 polymerase domain to form the full-length NS5. (c) ZIKV infectious life cycle: the virus is attached (1) and subsequently internalized (2) by receptor-mediated endocytosis. The virus is then trafficked to early endosomes, where the acidic environment induces fusion (3) between the virus and host membrane resulting in particle disassembly and genome release (4) . RNA is replicated and translated into a single polyprotein, which is processed by host and virus-encoded proteins (5) . Following translation, a replication complex is assembled and associated to virusinduced membranes where viral replication takes place (6) . The progeny RNA (+) strands can either initiate a new translation cycle or be assembled into virions within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (7) . The resultant immature virions are transported to the trans-Golgi where the immature virions are transformed into mature infectious particles (8) that are released by exocytosis (9) . In the pink boxes are the names of the compounds that can inhibit the marked steps of the virus lifecycle.",

Envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), which is expressed as prM, the precursor to M, and capsid (C) are the structural proteins, which form the virion. The NS proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5) are essential for genomic replication and modulation of host immunity [10] (Fig. 1b) . Figure 1c presents an overview of the replication process of ZIKV in the infected cell, showing the marked steps of the replication, which can be inhibited by the compounds discussed below in this review. We also present a special section (see supplementary material online: viral entry and replication mechanisms). Initially, before the availability of ZIKV structures in early March 2016, there were several efforts to develop homology models of the ZIKV proteins based on close homologs such as dengue virus (DENV; see Glossary) and other flaviviruses [11] [12] [13] . Since late March 2016, ZIKV protein structures have been determined mostly by X-ray crystallography and have been made available in databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [14] : NS1, NS2B-NS3 protease, NS3 helicase, NS5 methyltransferase, NS5 polymerase, NS5 full-protein and envelope glycoprotein (Table 1). Among them, NS2B-NS3 protease, NS3 helicase and NS5 methyltransferase structures are available with ligands, ATP or RNA; this is very useful for ligand-binding-site identification in virtual screens versus apo conformations.",

Figure 2 shows some ZIKV protein 3D structures and their ligand and or substrate binding pockets. The substrate binding pocket of ZIKV NS2B/NS3 protease (NS2B residues: S81, D83, K54 and NS3pro residues: D75, H51, S135, G133, G151, D129, Y161) ( Fig. 2a) was based on the co-crystallized compound 1H-1,3-benzodiazol-1ylmethanol [15] and a boronate inhibitor [16] , which bind to a similar pocket. NS3 helicase presents two binding sites, one encompasses the RNA strand and the other is where the ATP molecule binds (Fig. 2b) [17] . The full-length NS5 protein contains two domains, representing distinct targets: the NS5 methyltransferase and NS5 polymerase [18] . The NS5 polymerase domain has three adjacent binding sites: the active site, the RNA site and the NTP channel [18] (Fig. 2c) . The NS5 methyltransferase domain has two substrates: SAM, a co-substrate involved in methyl group transfer, and GTP, a substrate for RNA synthesis [18] . Consequently, the accessibility of these two substrates, together with a conserved catalytic tetrad of Lys61, Asp146, Lys182, Glu218, forms the active site [18] (Fig. 2d) . ZIKV envelope protein is composed of three distinct domains: the b-barrel-shaped domain (DI), the finger-like domain (DII) and the immunoglobulin-like domain (DIII) (Fig. 2e ). Domain II is responsible for the dimerization [19] . A binding site between DI and DIII, enclosing a hydrophobic cavity around a flexible linker, was computationally predicted [20] . The protein-protein binding pocket is composed of residues from DI and DIII (Fig. 2e) . The crystallographic structure of the capsid protein was recently solved [21, 22] . It contains four a helices in each monomer, and it forms a dimer (Fig. 2f) . We predicted the capsid pocket druggability using the PockDrug server [23] , which identified three pockets: pocket 1 (between a2 and a3 helices), pocket 2 (between N-terminal and a1 helix of the monomers) and pocket 3 (between a4 helices of the monomers).",

Together with NS2B, NS3 protease is responsible for cleavage and posttranslational modification of the viral polyprotein [16, 29] . Flavivirus NS4A and NS4B proteins compose the ER membrane-associated replication complex [30] [31] [32] . DENV NS4B has been shown to interact with NS3h and dissociate it from single-stranded RNA to modulate RNA synthesis [33] . ZIKV NS4A and NS4B cooperatively suppress the host's Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, inhibiting neurogenesis and inducing autophagy [34] . For these reasons, NS4B is an important target and its inhibition could impair viral propagation. Unfortunately, no crystal structures of ZIKV NS4B are available (as of 25 th June 2018). NS5 contains a methyltransferase domain, which methylates the RNA cap structure, and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain, which synthesizes the viral RNA and is thus essential to ZIKV survival and establishment of the infection in host cells [18] .",

Regarding this, NS5 proteins have been shown to inhibit the IFN signaling to evade host antiviral defense [35] . The NS5 protein uses different mechanisms (depending on the specific flavivirus) to target this signaling pathway. For Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and West Nile virus (WNV), NS5 proteins inhibit signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT1) phosphorylation and nuclear translocation [36] , this action was related to Ribbon-representation of some of the ZIKV protein 3D structures. (a) NS2B-NS3 protease, highlighting the substrate/ligand-binding pocket occupied by a boronate inhibitor [16] and the compound 1H-1,3-benzodiazol-1-ylmethanol [15] . (b) NS3 helicase, highlighting the RNA and ATP binding sites [17] . [20] . This predicted binding pocket encloses a hydrophobic cavity around the flexible linker joining DI and DIII. (f) Capsid protein [21, 22] and the predicted ligand-binding pockets. All these 3D structures are available in PDB and the figures were built using the VMD program [172] (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/). the polymerase domain [37] . For Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), NS5 blocks tyrosine phosphorylation of tyrosine protein kinase Tyk2 [38] . For yellow fever virus (YFV), NS5 can bind to STAT2, but only after IFN treatment, and this prevents STAT2 binding to IFNstimulated responsive promoter elements present on IFN target genes [39] .",

Particularly for ZIKV, a docking study was carried out to predict the protein-protein interactions between NS5, seven in absentia homolog (SIAH2) protein and STAT2 proteins. The study suggests that: (i) NS5 recruits SIAH2 for the ubiquitination-dependent degradation of STAT2; and (ii) the NS5 amino acid residues involved in interaction with SIAH2 and/or STAT2 were found to be conserved across related flaviviruses [42] . Another structural study of ZIKV NS5 indicated that the smallmolecule inhibitor-binding site of DENV3 NS5 is structurally conserved in ZIKV NS5, indicating a potential mechanism for functional inhibition of ZIKV NS5 [43] . In principle, small molecules interfering with the function of any ZIKV viral proteins have potential in restricting virus replication and preventing the progress of ZIKV-infection-related pathogenesis and diseases. Here, we summarize several inhibitors targeting viral proteins that have been identified from high-throughput cell-based screening, in silico docking or compound library screening. Some of them have even undergone in vivo testing.",

The compound ST-148 has been shown to interact with the capsid protein and was identified as a potent inhibitor of all four serotypes of DENV in vitro and in vivo, reducing viremia and viral load in vital organs [24] . Characterization of the mode-of-action of ST-148 showed that it directly targeted the capsid protein and presented bimodal antiviral activity affecting assembly and/or release and entry of infectious DENV particles [51] . Another example of a flaviviral capsid inhibitor is the biotinylated derivative of compound SL209, which inhibited HCV infection, blocking the core dimerization with an IC 50 of 2.80 mM [52] . Both studies support the hypothesis that inhibitors of viral capsid formation might constitute a new class of antiviral agents, and therefore could also be applicable to ZIKV.",

In this way, many natural products have been tested against NS2B-NS3 protease, and some of them were able to inhibit ZIKV protease activity. In one study, 22 compounds were tested at (the relatively high concentration of) 100 mM, and seven compounds were able to inhibit >50% of the protease activity [57] . The IC 50 s of these compounds were determined and ranged from 22 to 112 mM [57] . In another study, five flavonoids and one natural phenol were tested [58] . The flavonoids were myricetin (IC 50 = 1.3 mM), quercetin (IC 50 = 2.4 mM), luteolin (IC 50 = 2.7 mM), isorhamnetin (IC 50 = 15.5 mM), apigenin (IC 50 = 56.3 mM) and the natural phenol curcumin (IC 50 = 3.5 mM). These polyphenols inhibit the enzyme in a noncompetitive mode, which means that they could perhaps be allosteric inhibitors. Docking studies showed that the compounds are predicted to bind to a pocket on the back of the active site of ZIKV NS2B-NS3 [58] . However, curcumin, quercetin and other flavonoids have been shown to be promiscuous inhibitors, for example via colloidal aggregation [59] [60] [61] ; curcumin also contains reactive Michael acceptors and quercetin has a catechol, a well-known PAINS substructure, which might make these compounds less favorable.",

Then, a library of FDA-approved drugs and investigational drugs (2816 drugs) was screened using this assay, and 23 compounds produced an IC 50 below 15 mM, of which 12 were considered PAINS. The remaining 11 compounds were tested for their protease inhibition activities, and three could inhibit with IC 50 values ranging from 1.1 to 15.9 mM. The three compounds were tested against ZIKV, DENV, WNV, JEV and YFV. They presented inhibitory activity close to the nanomolar level, whereas temoporfin (Fig. 3b ) displayed an EC 50 (half-maximal effective concentration) for all flaviviruses tested at low nanomolar concentrations. The therapeutic indices for all three compounds were high, because their CC 50 (concentration that inhibits 50% of mammalian cell proliferation) was considerably higher than their EC 50 . The com-pounds were also able to inhibit ZIKV replication in placental epithelial and neuronal cells and to inhibit viral polyprotein cleavage. Temoporfin was tested in a viremia mouse model and a lethal mouse model and was able to inhibit viremia and protect Chemical structures of selected Zika virus (ZIKV) protein inhibitors. (a) Envelope glycoprotein inhibitor: nanchangmycin (IC 50 = 0.1 mM) [48] . (b) NS2B-NS3 protease inhibitors: temoporfin (IC 50 = 1.1 mM) [62] and NSC157058 (IC 50 = 0.82 mM) [66] . (c) NS3 helicase inhibitor: suramin (EC 50 = 0.42 mM), which was tested only in a cell-based assay in ZIKV [75] . (d) NS5 polymerase inhibitors: sofosbuvir (IC 50 = 7.3 mM) [105] , 2-C-ethynyl-UTP (IC 50 = 0.46 mM) [99] and DMB213 (IC 50 = 5.2 mM) [105] . (e) NS5 methyltransferase inhibitor: sinefungin (IC 50 = 1.18 mM) [90, 91] . 83% of the mice; the mice that survived did not present any signs of neurological disorder [62] . A similar study was done using structure-based virtual screening (VS) of 8277 compounds from the DrugBank database, and the top 100 candidates were identified [63] . From these, eight clinically approved compounds belonging to different drug classes were selected for further validation studies. From the eight selected compounds, five were validated as NS2B-NS3 protease inhibitors. Then, the compounds novobiocin, lopinavir, ritonavir and rifampicin which had favorable safety profiles and could be administrated to pregnant women were selected for phenotypic screening. Two compounds were able to inhibit ZIKV replication. Because the compound novobiocin had a higher selectivity index, it was tested in vivo. Dexamethasone immunosuppressed mice with disseminated ZIKV infection and novobiocin treatment had a significantly higher survival rate, lower mean blood and tissue viral loads, as well as less severe histopathological changes than untreated controls [63] .",

Based upon a literature review, 11 drugs were selected to be tested in ZIKV if they could match the following criteria: (i) known toxicity profile in humans and pregnancy; (ii) known broad-spectrum antiviral activity; (iii) known antiviral activity against flavivirus or another RNA virus; (iv) coverage of a broad range of indications and drug classes. Bromocriptine presented inhibitory activity in a cytopathic-effect inhibition assay, virus-yield-reduction assay and plaqueyield-reduction assay. The drug was predicted to bind to NS2B-NS3 protease through molecular docking studies and also presented inhibition of the proteolytic activity of the enzyme [64] . Twentyseven HCV NS3-NS4A protease inhibitors were tested in ZIKV NS2B-NS3; ten presented IC 50 values below 50 mM. The best two inhibitors were tested to determine their inhibition type, and they presented competitive inhibition profiles, meaning that they might bind at the active site [65] . Aprotinin, a 58 amino acid bovine trypsin inhibitor, previously tested against WNV protease, also inhibits ZIKV protease (IC 50 = 70 nM), and molecular modeling studies predicted that the inhibitor probably blocks the interactions of NS3 and NS2B [66] . By contrast, in our analysis of crystal structures of WNV protease with bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (PDB ID 2IJO) [67] and of DENV protease bound to aprotinin (PDB ID 3U1J) [68] , these types of inhibitors bind to and occlude the substrate site. A focused library of protease inhibitors that bind to WNV exosites was tested, and $700 structurally similar compounds were screened [66] . The best inhibitors were NSC157058 (IC 50 = 0.82 mM) (Fig. 3b) , NSC86314 (IC 50 = 0.97 mM) and NSC716903 (IC 50 = 1.12 mM). They were also tested against furin, a human serine protease with a cleavage sequence preference similar to those of flaviviral proteases, and they showed no effect at 100 mM. These compounds decreased the viral yield in neuronal precursor cells. The best inhibitor, NSC157058, was tested using an in vivo mouse model and decreased the viremia by tenfold; unfortunately, it has a very unfavorable pharmacokinetics profile [66] .",

Twenty-nine compounds were selected from a VS pipeline to be tested in a protease inhibition trial, of which three were subsequently selected to be tested in the allosteric assay. Only NSC135618 was able to inhibit the protease. The same compound also inhibited viral replication of DENV, ZIKV, WNV and YFV [69] . Crystal structure elucidations and MD studies have been undertaken to further understand the interactions and conformational changes of the protein bound to its inhibitors. The inhibitor complex seen in the crystal structures could provide a model for assemblies formed at the site of polyprotein processing, guiding future drug discovery processes against ZIKV protease [15, 16, 70] .",

Although we have recently had some promising preliminary results in our own virtual screens against ZIKV NS3h, developing drugs that target ZIKV NS3h could involve significant hurdles. For instance, the accessible pocket(s) within the active site of the NS3h-RNA complex is relatively shallow, and previous efforts to discover specific inhibitors of DENV NS3h have been challenging [71] . A potential strategy to deal with these issues could involve targeting other sites of ZIKV NS3h, such as the putative allosteric site that we discovered in our MD simulations [72] . We are currently performing new VS against snapshots of ZIKV NS3h that we generated with MD to test this strategy. Other challenges are related to: (i) the development of potent inhibitors, as a result of the lack of the specific amino acid interaction with ATP nucleobase or ribose ring; and (ii) the discovery of specific inhibitors, because the host helicase is within the same SF2 superfamily as NS3h [71] .",

The authors also suggest that suramin might inhibit the NS3h activity or might affect packaging by binding to positively charged residues on the capsid protein [75] . MD simulations of NS3h where performed to study the proteins flexibility and conformations preferences [72] . This work showed that the RNA binding loop is influenced by the presence of the RNA strand, being more stable and in a closed conformation, when RNA is bound to the protein [72] . The different conformations observed during MD showed a distinct region beneath or behind the ATP site, which could perhaps be an allosteric site, and could help guide the discovery or design of new inhibitors. These conformations and strategies are guiding new VS experiments in the OpenZika project, which is being performed on IBM's World Community Grid (WCG). OpenZika has been virtually screening millions of compounds against all of the ZIKV protein structures (and targets from related flaviviruses) using molecular docking (on WCG) and QSAR modeling filtering (performed in-house) [76] . This project is ongoing and several compounds are currently being assayed that were identified in these virtual screens. Other flaviviral NS3 helicase inhibitors such as ivermectin [77] and benzoxazole have activity against YFV NS3h and DENV NS3h, respectively [78] . Ivermectin was also reported to inhibit DENV NS5 interaction with its nuclear transporter importin (IMP) a/b in vitro [79, 80] . All these NS3h agents are also interesting compounds to be tested against ZIKV NS3h.",

NITD-618 faced problems with pharmacokinetics in in vivo studies because of its high lipophilicity, and medicinal chemistry attempts to overcome this issue resulted in loss of antiviral selectivity against DENV [86] . In another screen using the NIH clinical collection, a naltrindole analog (SDM25N) was found to inhibit DENV, and specific NS4B point mutations (F164L and P104L) conferred resistance against the compound, indicating that NS4B is probably the targeted protein [87] . A spiropyrazolopyridone compound was found to inhibit DENV serotypes 2 and 3 but not 1 and 4. This fact is correlated with the low identity between NS4B of flaviviruses and even between different serotypes of DENV [88] . The compound was able to suppress viremia in a mouse model of DENV serotype 2 infection. Two compounds (CCG-3394 and CCG-4088) were hits from a screen against YFV NS4B, and mutations on the K128 residue conferred resistance to YFV against both of these compounds [89] .",

They started from the crystallographic structure bound to SAM and developed the analog, attaching a 4-fluorophenyl group that gave the compound the capacity to bind to a part of the RNA tunnel and to occupy the Cap methylation site [93] . Designing ZIKV-specific MTase inhibitors is a challenge, as is the case for DENV and other flaviruses, mainly owing to the selectivity of these compounds to SAM-binding or SAM-utilizing proteins present in the host cell, because of the similarity to human RNA and DNA MTases [29] . Moreover, another issue with the design of competitive MTase inhibitors is the high cellular SAM concentration [94] . Still, these issues have been overcome in the field of kinases [95] , indicating that it could also be feasible for MTases [94] .",

In addition to the inhibition of the function of viral proteins, an attractive broad-spectrum strategy is to target host cell processes, because they are often employed by multiple viruses and are less prone to the development of drug resistance [108] . The recently described inhibitors of the most commonly targeted cellular functions in ZIKV can be found in Table  S1 (see supplementary material online) and are reviewed below. Moreover, we also present a special section regarding the antiviral effects of the type I and II interferons in the supplementary material.",

Furthermore, there is evidence that inhibition of nucleoside biosynthesis triggers the activation of antiviral interferon-stimulated genes in human cells [109] . Thus, host enzymes involved in the de novo biosynthesis of nucleosides, such as inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), are interesting targets for broad-spectrum antiviral therapy. IMPDH catalyzes the oxidative conversion of inosine 5 0 -monophosphate into xanthosine 5 0monophosphate, which is the first committed and rate-limiting step of the guanine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway [110] . Known inhibitors of IMPDH include ribavirin, 5-ethynyl-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylimidazole-4-carboxamide (EICAR) and mycophenolic acid (MPA).",

It was found to inhibit the virus-induced cytopathic effects (CPE) of several flaviviruses, including ZIKV (EC 50 = 142.9 mg/ml) [112] . A recent study tested the activity of known broad-spectrum antivirals, including ribavirin, which yielded a poor inhibition of virus-induced CPE (EC 50 > 50 mM for MR766 strain), concluding it was not a suitable candidate as a ZIKV therapeutic [113] . Other nucleoside biosynthesis inhibitors were also tested in the same study, among which were MPA (EC 50 = 0.11 mM), brequinar (EC 50 = 0.08 mM) and 6-azauridine (EC 50 = 0.98 mM). The latter two compounds inhibit dihidroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) and orotidylic acid (OMP) decarboxylase, respectively, which are two enzymes involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis [113] . It is important to highlight that several nucleotide biosynthesis inhibitors suppress viral growth through innate immunity [109] . In a study by Lucas-Hourani and co-workers, the authors showed that pyrimidine deprivation, using brequinar and another compound DD264, is not directly responsible for the antiviral activity of pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitors but it rather involves the induction of a metabolic stress and the subsequent triggering of the cellular immune response [109] . Barrows and co-workers also tested MPA, which presented potent anti-ZIKV activity, inhibiting ZIKV infection in HuH-7, HeLa, JEG3, hNSC and HAEC cells [114] . Their screen also detected other nucleoside biosynthesis inhibitors, such as azathiopurine, mercaptopurine hydrate, mycophenolate mofetil (a prodrug of MPA) and thioguanine.",

Although this recognition might be unrelated to its kinase activity, AXL inhibitors were found to inhibit ZIKV infection rates. Rausch et al. screened a library of $2000 compounds on human osteosarcoma cells (U2OS) and found 19 ZIKV inhibitors, eight of which had protein kinases as targets, including five TKRs and, among these, two AXL inhibitors [48] . The same AXL inhibitors did not exhibit the same activity on different cell lines (HBMEC and Jeg-3), indicating that the effect is cell-type specific. The authors also point out that Jeg-3 cells are highly permissive to ZIKV infection, despite showing no detectable AXL expression levels, which suggests that this receptor is not essential for infection [48] .

Impairment of these functions results in reduced viral assembly and budding. Examples are the ER membrane complex (EMC), a-glucosidase, cyclophilin and proteasome elements. Some inhibitors have been investigated under this context. EMC, an ensemble of nine components that are thought to assist protein folding, has been shown to be upregulated in ZIKV-infected cells. Several proteins of this complex are multipass membrane proteins [148] . Another key player related to protein metabolism is a-glucosidase, an ER-resident enzyme that catalyzes the removal of glucose units from N-linked oligosaccharides. This processing is crucial for the nascent glycoprotein maturation and subsequent correct folding. Glycoproteins that fail to be processed are subjected to abnormal accumulation in the ER and ER-associated degradation (ERAD), in which nascent misfolded proteins are retrotranslocated back to the cytosol, ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome [149] . a-Glucosidase inhibitors exhibit broad antiviral activity against multiple genera [150, 151] , but celgosvir (6-O-butanoyl castanospermine) showed poor activity against ZIKV in a CPEbased assay in Vero 76 cells infected with either MR766 or PRVABC59 strains (EC 50 > 50 mM in both cases) [113] .",

It is a weak base (pK 1 = 8.1, pK 2 = 10.1), and the pH of lysosomes in the presence of chloro-quine increases from $4 to $6 [159] . This increase is thought to be responsible for the inhibition of the pH-dependent fusion step of viral entry. Chloroquine was tested against ZIKV, showing activity in Vero cells (9.82 AE 2.79 mM), human brain microvascular endothelial cells (14.20 AE 0.18 mM) and human neural stem cells (12.36 AE 2.76 mM). It reduced the number of infected cells in vitro, inhibited virus production and cell death promoted by ZIKV infection and displayed relatively minor cytotoxic effects (CC 50 ranging from 94.95 to 134.54 mM). Moreover, chloroquine partially reversed morphological changes induced by ZIKV in mouse neurospheres [160] . Chloroquine was found to reduce viral burden in the placenta of ZIKV-infected C57BL/6 pregnant mice [161] . However, it also showed controversial results in another study [113] . Quinacrine (EC 50 = 2.27 AE 0.14 mM), mefloquine (EC 50 3.95 AE 0.21 mM) and GSK369796 (EC 50 = 2.57 AE 0.09 mM), other antimalarial drugs with a similar mechanism of action, were also recently tested against ZIKV [162] .",

Owing to the current state of known anti-ZIKV compounds, there is probably some way to go until clinical trials of the discovered candidates are undertaken, especially when considering that some patients, including immunosuppressed and pregnant women, will have underlying medical conditions. In this regard, one strategy to overcome the risk of teratogenesis is the development of new drugs to treat Zika based on two-stage Phase II clinical trials: first-stage focusing on testing the efficacy in nonpregnant patients and the second-stage focusing on pregnant women. These will possibly reduce the overall costs of trials, facilitating their logistical set up and enhancing the safety level for the patients [170] .",

Much of the work described herein would have benefited from having experienced medicinal chemists involved to advise on the utility of compounds selected. This would also help to avoid compounds like PAINS [47] , which were reported as hits from several screens. Ultimately, the recent advances in the discovery of anti-ZIKV agents, ZIKV protein structures and host target protein structures, and our understanding of the disease itself, are not only crucial to advancing the fight against ZIKV but they can also be useful for the next emerging virus outbreak to which we will have to respond. We should also heed the lessons learned from ZIKV drug discovery so we can be more successful and avoid dead-ends in future.",
