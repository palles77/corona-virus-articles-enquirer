There are characteristics shared by all viruses that set them apart from other self-replicating systems. Viruses are obligate molecular parasites that rely on only one type of genomic material (either DNA or RNA) and use a proteinaceous genome package to facilitate dispersal. While viruses are not metabolically active organisms, their phenotypic variation results in differential replication success, thereby ensuring they are subject to the laws of evolution. Virus taxa, like organisms more frequently investigated evolutionarily, clearly change through time and to profound degrees. Unlike the cellular \"macrobiota,\" however, our observations of viral transformation are very direct and never from examination of a large-scale past timeline such as the fossil record. If observed proportions of certain character state changes in viruses were applied to megafauna, hypotheses regarding the amount of time required to manufacture these changes would most likely be on the order of hundreds of thousands to millions of years. Yet critical changes in such factors as host range (habitat), capsid and envelope proteins (morphology), and life-history characters are common in some viruses within the time of a typical research project.",

In other words, the fundamental nature of selection is not influenced by organism complexity (fitness must always move \"uphill\"), yet the character of selective pressure is determined by an organism's necessities for survival. It could also be argued that, because of the limited sequence space of viral genomes, the high probability of genetic drift during transmission bottlenecks, extremely large population sizes, and (at least for many RNA viruses) the high mutation and recombination rates, viruses exhibit greater mobility through the space of their selective or adaptive environments than do more complex organisms (Moya, 1997) .",

Investigation of the evolutionary ecology of viruses seeks to explain observed patterns of viral diversity by invoking mechanisms that take into account evolutionary response to the environment(s) in which they exist. Such research relies (heavily) on very disparate areas of science. For instance, mere description of such fundamental virus characteristics as appearance, life cycle, and tissue tropism is only possible through the tools of biochemistry and molecular biology. Answers regarding virus population dynamics such as growth and size fluctuation are often provided by epidemiological research. And evolutionary interpretation and prediction are formulated using concepts of theoretical population biology.

The direction and extent of this change is determined by a combination of stochastic and environmental factors that are specific for a given time, space, and taxon. Therefore, the offspring of individuals or groups selected for reproduction in one biological circumstance are by no means guaranteed to thrive in the following generation since the selective environment may be slightly or radically different. An admittedly poorly defined and at times controversial evolutionary term, adaptation essentially refers to characters that arise and persist as a result of such selection and thus confer upon their bearers the ability to succeed genetically in a specific environment. Adaptation can also refer to the actual process of acquiring such traits.

R0 is a conceptually convenient metric, especially when considering the absolute fitness of an organism (for instance, the potential for occupation of a host population by a specific virus) but may be misleading when interpreted as a measure of relative fitness since alone it provides no information about individual reproductive rate compared to the population reproductive rate over the same time-span. The competing virus with the highest R0 can have the highest probability of long-term survival, but determining this probability for an individual would require comparison of all relevant R0s in a population or group. Therefore, R0 for an individual can be greater than 1 (implying \"reproductive success\"), but this provides no information about individual performance with respect to population growth as a whole. Therefore, an individual with R0 < 1 may actually have high relative fitness under conditions of population decrease provided the individual's rate of decrease is correspondingly smaller.",

Giske and colleagues (1993) have described a particularly useful relative fitness term (~) that measures an individual's reproductive output relative to that of its population as the difference between p and r. Therefore, 9 is a measure of fitness that is both instantaneous in real time and relative. As such, any positive value of 9 indicates increasing proportional repre-sentation of a particular phenotype in a population even when R0 < 1 or p < 0, provided r is sufficiently small. Relative fitness in this sense is both more accurate since it accounts for variation in generation length and perhaps more applicable since it describes an individual's reproductive performance in light of that for its population as a whole.",

A more universal expectation of host occupation is competition between tli ffcrent viral strains or individuals present at a given time. In this sense, selection is effectively acting on viruses as it would on nonparasitic organisms occupying some particular habitat. Intrahost evolutionary success is therefore largely independent from interhost success and subsequent evolutionary persistence. In other words, adaptive viral characters favored within the relatively closed system of one host individual arise and persist due to intrahost selection, the nature and strength of which is determined by the conditions and other virus strains contained therein. These characters may not necessarily be favored in the larger \"open\" arena that includes all viruses occupying a host population (discussed below).",

This accumulation of both viral particles and non-infectible cells would result in isolated competition and subsequently produce selection for either quick and successful cell invasion or dispersal to more fertile areas.

Furthermore, it may be additionally advantageous to select among all the possible transport receptors those that can internalize the given virus type most effectively.

A mammalian target immune cell of viral replication for which a great deal of research has been undertaken is the T lymphocyte.

A very prevalent viral technique of immunosuppression involves utilization of proteins, whether viral or cellular, to disrupt the host antiviral response. Many viruses have the ability to sabotage production or function of host cytokines using their own gene products. Such abilities of individual viruses give rise to obvious evolutionary benefits not only for that individual but also for other members of the infecting viral population. Many host molecules --including interferons, interleukins, and other cytokines are susceptible to the action of immunosuppressive viruses (see Table II ). The action of these molecules may be at the level of prevention of transcription (e.g., HBV terminal protein), or translation (e.g., adenovirus E1A), inhibition of cytokine activated enzymes (e.g., RNase-L inactivation in HSV infection), or sequestration of the molecules via complement binding (e.g., IFN-y receptor decoy produced by myxoma virus), to name a few. Viral gene products may also interfere with other aspects of the host antiviral response such as antigen presentation (vaccinia virus, HSV) and downregulation of host cell genes required for proper c. Clonal Deletion and Immunologic Invisibility. Viruses may avoid contact with a functional immune response by becoming antigenically \"invisible.\" For instance, some viruses that utilize vertical transmission do not elicit a specific antiviral response at all due to the inability of the immune system to recognize them as foreign. One such strategy is well exemplified by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in mice. In this system, viruses that infect adult mice are effectively cleared from the host principally by way of an LCMV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response (Zinkernagel and Welsh, 1976; Byrne and Oldstone, 1984; Moskophidisy et al., 1987; Ahmed et al., 1988; Matloubian et al., 1994) . Mice that are infected in utero or perinatally, however, retain high lifelong titers of infectious LCMV throughout their bodies. This persistence is made possible by the lack of a specific CTL-mediated antiviral response due to clonal deletion of LCMV-specific T cells during mouse ontogeny (Buchmeier et al., 1980; Ahmed et al., 1984; Moskophidis et al., 1987; Pircher et al., 1989; Jamieson et al., 1991) . The early and pervasive presence of LCMV particles (antigen) results in immunologic \"acceptance\" of the virus by the host yet still allows for a completely functional immune response against other pathogens and their antigens.",

This can be accomplished in a number of ways, among which is viral persistence, including the possibility of replication within immunologically privileged tissue that is inaccessible to the host antiviral response. For instance, many types of herpesviruses (varicella zoster, herpes simplex) lie latent in nonreplicating sensory neurons that are poorly penetrated by the immune system. These viruses may periodically move through axons to epithelial or ophthalmic sites for replication (where they may eventually be suppressed by the immune response) but never actually leave the host permanently. Some viruses will replicate within tissues that experience little or no exposure to antiviral host defenses. Human polyomaviruses B K and JC as well as cytomegalovirus benefit from limited T-cell effectiveness within kidney epithelial tissue by replicating there and thus avoid destruction quite efficiently .",

Transmission and Neutralization Thresholds: Temporal \"Evasion.\" Other viruses may evade immune contact by completing sufficient replication and transmission before a significant host antiviral attack can be fully executed. Many viruses that replicate to high concentrations quickly employ this technique. Such viruses operate under conditions of three relevant thresholds: (1) the intrahost virus population size that triggers an immune response; (2) the intrahost population size that allows for interhost transmission; (3) the amount of time it takes an antiviral reaction to decrease the viral concentration below the transmission threshold. Figure 1 provides a simple illustration of intrahost population growth for an imaginary acutely infecting virus. Under this model, a virus can only survive evolutionarily in a host population given the following specific conditions. The threshold viral concentration for effective interhost transmission (B) must be exceeded for sufficient time as to allow for occupation of a new susceptible host. This time will vary inversely with the quantity of infectious virus being shed by the host. A virus must therefore employ reproductive strategies that can include maximizing the amount of time it is being shed in adequate numbers (E-D) and/or minimizing B (or, conversely, maximizing A, the threshold concentration triggering a host antiviral response). This appears to be analogous to the strategies used by many well-examined viruses such as influenza, measles, rhinoviruses, and VZV, to name just a few. Under the conditions of this model a virus may also exhibit A > B, in which case an antiviral response is (effectively) never activated and the virus will be transmitted satisfactorily as long as its concentration remains above B. This latter strategy might only be evolutionarily stable for viruses of limited pathogenicity since host mortality usually limits sustainable viral spread. Also, subpopulations within a given host might differ in the shape of their respective curves and values for A, B, C, D, and E.",

Yet another adaptation used to evade host antiviral defenses that has arisen in many viruses with RNA genomes is rapid and continual production of antigenic variation. High mutation rates in some viruses (HIV, FMDV) as well as reassortment of genomic segments of others (influenza virus) give rise to a quasi-species (also referred to as a mutant or variant swarm) population structure within an infected host and/or host population (Holland et al., 1982; Both et al., 1983; Mateu et al., 1989; Bachrach, 1968; Nowak et al., 1990 Nowak et al., , 1995 Wolinsky et al., 1996) . The result is genomic variation that is manifest as phenotypic diversity in the form of multiple antigenic types present in a single host at one time (see Fig. 2 ). This heterogeneity may cause high overall mortality rates for the virus, but at the same time it provides assurance that at least a small proportion of variants will avoid host neutralization due to the inability of the specific antiviral response to act both effectively and simultaneously on every antigenic type that exists or arises.

It may, however, be thought of in relation to negative frequency-dependent selection, a condition that does exist in many species predator-prey interactions. In this case, rarer phenotypes (e.g., antigenic variants) are favored as long as they remain relatively uncommon. Once a variant rises in frequency, the probability that it will be recognized by a predator species (or host immune system) increases accordingly, and thus its growth rate will be reduced, usually to the advantage of (immunologically) less conspicuous mutants. It is in this way that the virus evades contact with antiviral components and persists within a host as a heterogeneous population.

Intrahost transport is perhaps most \"extreme\" in systemic plant viruses since distances can be very large (e.g., as in coniferous trees), and this subject has been investigated (for reviews, see Carrington et al., 1996; Deom et al., 1992; Maule, 1991; Mushegian and Koonin, 1993) . Long-distance movement in plant viruses usually takes place in the sieve elements and cells of the phloem. Plant viruses are known to utilize movement proteins (MPs) that facilitate both cell-tocell and long-distance transport. MPs have been identified in many plant viruses, but the biochemical and molecular mechanisms involved unfortunately are largely unknown. MPs are frequently capsid proteins, as has been demonstrated in tobacco mosaic virus (Dawson et al., 1988; Saito et al., 1990) , red clover necrotic mosaic dianthovirus (Xiong et al., 1993; Vaewhongs and Lommel, 1995) , cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) (Taliansky and Garcia-Arenal, 1995) , and tobacco etch potyvirus (Dolja et al., 1994 (Dolja et al., , 1995 , among others. Replication proteins such as those involved in genome duplication have also been identified as necessary for long-distance movement in brome mosaic virus (Traynor et al., 1991) and CMV (Gal-On et al., 1994) .",

It is conceivable that a virus type might maximize its intrahost replication only within a very specific time-frame in order to maximize the probability of transmission. For example, this may be pertinent with respect to solitary animal species that congregate only at very specific times of the year for breeding. Under such circumstances, natural selection might favor a reproductive strategy in which a resident virus population exists at low, persistent concentrations during most of the year but \"turns on\" high-level replication in order to be shed during a time of year when transmission probability is consistently (and predictably) highest. There are numerous avian and mammalian hormones, for instance, whose release is dependent on photoperiod that could realistically activate or suppress viral replication.",

Intrahost selective pressure may be compared with that within a species ecosystem. In an overall sense, resources require optimal, not maximal, consumption. On an individual level, negative interspecific interactions (predation) should be minimized and reproductive rates high. Just as with cellular species, viral traits that may arise or be selected for in one particular environmental scenario (time and place) do not guarantee indefinite evolutionary stability. Selective pressure within a particular host may similarly be contradictory to selective pressure imposed by requirements of interhost long-term survival. For instance, as with cellular species, where ecological continuance will not occur under conditions of resource overexploitation, virus populations will not persist evolutionarily when host resources are consumed beyond the point of sustainability. The effect is a balance between adaptations that allows sufficient harvest of host tissue without jeopardizing prospective abundance of the host as a source of reproductive substrate.",

It is difficult to make generalizations about the reproductive problems faced by viruses whether inside or between hosts, but something that we can perhaps expect about interhost (especially horizontal) transmission is relative unpredictability in the external environment, especially with respect to the host population. It is important to emphasize here that intra-and interhost selective pressures differ considerably in character. The intrahost environment is more or less a closed system somewhat analogous to a natural selective \"microcosm,\" except that the intrahost conditions are comparatively less heterogeneous temporally and spatially than the interhost \"macrocosm.\"",

Also, intraspecific competition (density dependence) may be included in growth of both virus and host populations; that is to say, host population sizes are regulated by extrinsic variables that are independent of viral infections yet dependent on the relative presence of other conspecific individuals. Therefore, population growth will in theory slow asymptotically as population size reaches the species carrying capacity. Other factors relevant to the dynamics of viral infection include population structure and spatiotemporal distribution of the potential hosts, environmental heterogeneity, and genetic makeup of the host population (for relevant and insightful reviews, see Anderson, 1991 , and Frank, 1996 . Equation (7), with the help of Figure 3 , outlines the prime adaptive pathways available for viral interhost fitness enhancement. That is, favorable adaptations can be ones that increase host-host transmission ([3), decrease virulence (ct), or decrease host recovery (cy). It also illustrates a complicated interrelationship of fitness characters. Fitness can be improved via effects on a number of attributes, and the magnitude of the improvement is directly related to the status of other selective conditions and adaptations (as well as ecological conditions).

At first glance, it might seem unusual that all viruses are not avirulent since relative fitness appears to increase as tx approaches zero. It may also seem intuitive that harm to the host should obviously be minimized since viruses are obligate parasites requiring living tissue for propagation. However, the reality of virus-host biology is that transmission is generally positively and host recovery negatively related to virus density, and as virus density increases so too does pathogenicity/mortality.",

In almost all models of parasite ecology it is assumed that, while transmission coefficients increase as intrahost parasite (virus) density increases, this relationship is rarely linear. However, host mortality (or morbidity) will occur near some threshold virus density, at which point the de facto transmission of intrahost viruses is zero. The effect is a balancing of pathogenic effects and overall transmission that is closely related to conditions in the host population.",

Extensive virus-induced diminishment of the host population resulted in evolutionarily stable emergence of a less virulent myxomavirus strain (see Fig. 4 ). In this instance, myxomavirus strains of high virulence killed their hosts too soon after inoculation and as a result were transmitted to new hosts infrequently since transmission occurs via a mosquito vector that only feeds on live rabbits. Strains of very low virulence also exhibit an interhost fitness disadvantage because they are usually cleared by host antiviral defenses before their populations reached sizes necessary for mounting of effective transmission stages (B in Fig. 1) . From this example the influence of host population structure can be seen. That is, levels of virulence are often determined by (and proportional to) the frequency with which interhost transmission opportunities arise, so that low virulence can typically be selected for when host-host contact is infrequent and vice versa (Bull, 1994) . Myxomavirus virulence is discussed in more detail below. ",

Because of this, MeV has a very high transmission rate ([3) in fully susceptible populations, which subsequently results in potentially explosive reproduction (R0). This is exemplified by the 1951 MeV outbreak in southwest Greenland (Christensen et al., 1953) . In this instance, the extraordinary transmissibility of MeV is demonstrated in the fact that one infected host gave rise to 250 new infections (i.e., R0 = 250) following exposure to many individuals during a large social congregation. In the end, 98.5% of the local population of 4320 people were infected.",

            "text": "b. Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type 1. HTLV-1 is a persistent virus that infects CD4 + lymphocytes and is capable of transforming infected cells after approximately 10--40 years of host occupation, thereby giving rise to adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL). Another HTLV-1 disease, known as tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) (also called HTLV-1-associated myelopathy), results from progressive demyelination of long motor neurons, causing paralysis, and is seen mainly in 20-to 50-year-old female hosts. HTLV-1 infection may also induce immunosuppression, resulting in an increase in opportunistic infections (Nakada et al., 1984; Newton et al., 1992; O'Doherty et al., 1984) . Most HTLV-1 infections are asymptomatic, but approximately 1-4% of infected hosts will develop disease symptoms (White and Fenner, 1994) . The human immune system cannot clear HTLV-1 from the body, so that the duration of infectiousness is lifelong. The number of unsusceptible hosts in a population is therefore always effectively zero. HTLV-1 differs from viruses such as MeV in that occupation of a host is long term and interhost transmission is both inefficient and infrequent. HTLV is transmitted between hosts almost exclusively via infected CD4 + lymphocytes (Yamamoto et al., 1984; Yamade et al., 1993; Seto et al., 1991; Ruscetti et al., 1983; de Rossi et al., 1985) . Replication is very slow, and this is most likely due to tight gene regulation by viral proteins. Host-host transmission takes place through sexual intercourse (Nakano et al., 1984; Tajima et al., 1982) , via blood transfusion (Okochi et al., 1984; Sato and Okochi, 1986) , and from mother to fetus or infant by passage of infected lymphocytes through the placenta or in breast milk (Kinoshita et al., 1984; Komuro et al., 1983; Tajima et al., 1982; Yamanouchi et al., 1985; Nakano et al., 1984) .",

Although the primary route of HTLV transmission appears to be from mother to offspring, this method does not appear to be highly efficient. For instance, Hirata and colleagues (1992) investigated the offspring of HTLV-I-infected mothers and found that 16% were infected at birth. They also observed among breast-fed infants that 27% of those breast-fed for more than 3 months and 5% of those breast-fed for less than 3 months were infected and 13% of bottle-fed infants were positive for HTLV-1.",

The lack of an effective host antiviral response as well as the virus's low replication rate (i.e., resource consumption) allows an intrahost population to successfully persist for many years. A very low probability (per unit time) of interhost transmission as well as a low probability of host damage (death) accompanies this persistence. Thus, HTLV-1 is an example of a parasite that employs an alternative life history to that of a more opportunistic replicator like MeV. HTLV-1 manages to keep R0 > 1 by exhibiting a very low transmission probability while remaining relatively unobtrusive within its host for a very long time. This long period of infectiousness will probably, but not necessarily, result in transmission to a new host(s). There is thus heterogeneity in an HTLV-1 population's overall transmission but not so much that it is lost from a host population, because this variance is counteracted by HTLV-I's host availability (susceptibility) and its protracted \"sit and quietly wait\" intrahost replication tactics.",

They are found only in endoparasitic wasp species of the families Brachonidae and Ichneumonidae. PDV genomes are integrated throughout the chromosomes of both male and female wasps (Fleming and Krell, 1993) and are only transmitted vertically in Mendelian fashion (Fleming and Krell, 1993; Stoltz, 1990) . The viruses replicate exclusively within cells of the female's ovarian calyx during a specific stage in development and are subsequently released into the oviduct Summers, 1986, 1991; Fleming and Krell, 1993; Webb and Summers, 1992) . During oviposition within a susceptible larval lepidopteran host, the eggs are coated with viral particles and thus transferred into the host body cavity (Vinson, 1977a; Norton and Vinson, 1977; Scott, 1974, 1975) . Once inside the lepidopteran, PDV genes are expressed in various tissues (Fleming and Krell, 1993; Blissard et al., 1986a Blissard et al., ,b, 1989 Strand et al., 1992; Theilman and Summers, 1986, 1988; , but no further viral replication takes place (Stoltz, 1990; Blissard et al., 1989; Strand et al., 1992) .",

It has been shown that PDVs alone (or in combination with wasp venom) provide these functions that are actually essential to reproduction of their parasitoid hosts (Asgari et al., 1997; Shelby and Webb, 1997; Vinson, 1977b; Davies and Vinson, 1988; Vinson and Stoltz, 1986; Edson et al., 1980; Vinson et al., 1979; Guzo and Stoltz, 1985; Kitano, 1982 Kitano, , 1986 Stoltzetal., 1988; Tanaka, 1987; Tanaka and Vinson, 1991) .

This fitness advantage may have resulted in cladogenesis, which gave rise to the MeV we see today.",

In addition, numerous examples exist of viral epidemics following unusual weather events that are attributed to changes in vector populations, such as the Culex pipiens-facilitated St. Louis encephalitis outbreak of 1933. Holland (1996) proposed that dengue (a humanmosquito-human-transmitted virus) outbreaks in recent human history are likely driven by changes in human population size and mobility, and inadequate vector control. Unfortunately, detailed studies examining the precise relationship between absolute transmission rates and vector populations are limited, but there is growing concern regarding the impact of global climate change on insect populations and resultant increases in viral infections (see Lovejoy, 1993; McMichael and Beers, 1994; Jetten and Focks, 1997) . It is conceivable, even likely, that future increased opportunities for vector-mediated transmission may bring about evolutionary adaptations that result in vector usage by viruses that previously did not rely on this inoculation route.",

Another environmental condition, say pH, may confer a different survival distribution. Therefore, when considered concurrently, an organism's area of potential survival with respect to these two variables may be represented as a distinct two-dimensional space, the dimensions being temperature and pH. The number of conditions is increased to generate a multidimensional (n-dimensional) space or hypervolume in which the organism's population is capable of continued existence. This represents the fundamental niche: the set of conditions under which an organism is capable of survival and reproduction in the absence of competition or predation.

The natural history of Ebola viruses is largely mysterious, but the four known subtypes are thought to be maintained in African nonhuman primates or other mammal populations and can sporadically be transmitted to humans and many other species of primates, mice, and guinea pigs. The extraordinary feature of Ebola virus replication is its ability to use many host tissue types. For instance, Ebola virus particles or antigens have been found in such diverse tissues as liver, spleen, lymph nodes, lung, gastrointestinal tract, and even the sweat glands of the skin (Murphy et al., 1990; .",

            "text": "An important question arises. What are the relative contributions of constraints on tissue tropism and host specificity to sustainable viral reproduction? In other words, is a given virus more likely to occupy a new tissue type within its normal host species or a homologous tissue type within a different host species/taxon? There are certainly examples of both types of diversification. One might predict, however, that viruses naturally occupying tissue 1 within host species 1 would have a higher probability of replicating in tissue 2 within this species since the likelihood of exposure to that tissue is very high relative to appropriate exposure to the homologous tissue in host species 2 (per Fahrenholz's rule; see Brooks and McLennan, 1993) . The relevant evidence instead appears to favor diversification driven by tissue type, not only for viruses but also for many parasites. In other words, a virus is often more likely to diversify into similar tissue types in new host species than to infect new tissue types in the same host. Along these lines, the probability of successful host jumping can be viewed as inversely related to phylogenetic distance between hosts, just as the probability of new tissue infection might be inversely related to factors such as molecular and developmental similarity of the tissues. Figure 7 shows a hypothetical phylogeny and the probability of viral transmission from one taxon (e.g., host species) to another as decreasing with increasing taxonomic/evolutionary divergence. Also shown is an arbitrary measure of tissue permissivity in relation to phylogenetic distance. The shapes of the two curves were deliberately drawn as seen to illustrate a point. Tissue permissivity for a virus is assumed to be directly related to overall evolutionary divergence of the cellular and molecular characteristics of tissues within a host clade. Therefore (assuming a constant rate of molecular evolutionary change), as host taxa diverge, their homologous tissues continually and regularly accumulate morphological differences that are \"recognizable\" to the virus. The exponentially decreasing probability of stable interspecies transmission by the virus reflects both the effects of changes in cell permissivity and the probability of necessary contact between disparate taxa. Interspecific contact between potential viral hosts is assumed to decrease at a rate greater than that of morphological change since as taxa diverge they often will become separated spatially (and perhaps temporally) by geographic movement, habitat usage changes, niche segregation, etc. This model obviously will not be applicable to all virus-host relationships, and both transmission and permissivity curves may take on many shapes depending on the specific virushost biology represented therein.",

During hemocoel translocation, mosquito-borne arboviruses may also replicate within alimentary tissue, reproductive organs, ganglia, muscle, pericardium, and Malpighian tubules (Hardy, 1988) .

An excellent and well-investigated example of this is influenza A, which is naturally perpetuated through populations of many wild birds (especially aquatic species), wherein it is rarely pathogenic despite the fact that all the known subtypes are represented (Hinshaw et al., 1980; Alexander, 1986) . Strains of influenza A (especially H 1N 1) have been known to move between swine and humans (Webster et al., 1992; Hinshaw et al., 1978; Schnurrenburger et al., 1970) and are all but conclusively determined as being derived from avian reservoirs (Webster et al., 1992 (Webster et al., , 1995 . Influenza A is also found in many other vertebrate species, including horses and sea mammals, and, based on serological and phylogenetic analysis, it is thought that interspecies transmission is frequent in these cases as well (Gorman et al., 1991; Webster et al., 1992 Webster et al., , 1995 . Thus, influenza A is capable of existence in more than one species and is quite frequently transmitted between species. This characteristic is thought to be related to the mutability of its genome through reassortment and rapid mutation accumulation (Scholtissek et al., 1977 (Scholtissek et al., , 1978 Scholtissek, 1995; Yamnikova et al., 1993; Reinacher et al., 1983; Domingo and Holland, 1994) and thus may not be as common in DNA viruses or viruses with nonsegmented genomes.",

First, increased contact between host and virus can result in infection outside the normal site of replication. Second, a change may occur in specific characteristics of previously unsusceptible individuals that results in their transformation into infectible hosts. Third, speciation (cladogenesis) of a host and the ensuing cladogenesis of viruses that infected the ancestral taxon (a.k.a. phylogenetic tracking, parallel cladogenesis). These three causes may or may not involve adaptive or other evolutionary change in the virus. Lastly, alteration in an existing viral phenotype or acquisition of a new phenotype via mutation or genetic exchange could allow occupation of new viral niches and habitats (host species, tissue type, etc.) and possibly bring about adaptive radiation.",

For example, feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) is incapable of sustained replication outside its normal host range. Canine parvovirus (CPV) is strongly suspected as being derived from FPV since it is genetically very similar and is capable of replication in both canines and felines. CPV did not exist before the late 1970s and spread worldwide in less than two years (Parrish et al., 1988) . CPV and FPV differ in only three amino acids of their VP2 capsid proteins: position 93 is asparagine in CPV and lysine in FPV; position 103 is alanine in CPV and valine in FPV; and position 323 is asparagine in CPV and aspartic acid in FPV (Parrish, 1997) . Using site-directed mutagenesis, Parrish (1997) was able to demonstrate that CPV viruses that were otherwise normal but contained lysine at position 93 were able to replicate in feline cells but lost their ability to replicate in canine cells. Furthermore, otherwise normal FPV that contained asparagine at positions 93 and 323 were able to replicate in both canine and feline cells. It is highly probable that these latter two mutations represent a key ecological innovation that recently facilitated parvoviral occupation of a new host niche and therefore enabled rapid (and extensive) spread of parvovirus into the world population of canines.",

Those collected from bowel tissue are only slightly capable of syncytia formation and only slightly T-cell tropic.

The name is derived from Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking Glass, in which the Red Queen states, \"Now here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.\" Clarke and colleagues (1994) examined fitness changes in distinct competing clonal populations of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) cultured in vitro. To accomplish this, they used quantitative relative fitness assays to measure fitness changes in VSV populations that initially were competitively equal. When sequentially passaged together, one of the VSV populations was inevitably totally displaced by the other. \"Winner\" and \"loser\" strains were then mixed with the ancestral wild-type strains to examine absolute fitness changes. In all cases, the derived virus populations were able to outcompete and displace their ancestral populations. In this important experiment, evolutionary change continually proceeded in such a way that overall survivability of present generations surpassed that of previous ones and was lower than those of the future. In other words, populations are competing in a \"zero sum game,\" where they must adaptively \"run\" just to stay at the same relative fitness level (Van Valen, 1973) . This effect has only been experimentally examined in VSV; therefore, whether or not it occurs in the evolution of other viruses (especially DNA viruses) cannot been addressed here.",

These viruses are aphid transmitted and infect a wide range of grass species worldwide. Historical records of B YDV isolated from oats in New York State between 1957 and 1976 indicate that, of the two main viral subtypes, BYDV-MAV and BYDV-PAV, the percentage of diseased plants infected with B YDV-MAV have decreased from 90 to 0% while the prevalence of BYDV-PAV increased during the same period from 3 to 98% (Rochow, 1979) and apparently still shows signs of superiority (Miller et al., 1991) . Power (1996) has examined direct and indirect viral interactions that may be contributing to the competitive dominance of B YDV-PAV. She maintains that BYDV-PAV may be winning an evolutionary battle because of its interactions with aphid vector species that are favoring higher transmission rates. For instance, B YDV-PAV can potentially use more than one aphid species for transmission (Sitobion avenae and Rhopalosiphum padi), whereas BYDV-MAV only uses S. avenae. In addition, R. padi was found to be a more efficient transmitter of virus than S. avenae Power et al., 1991) . Morphological alteration of vectors as a result of viral infection may also be enhancing the spread of BYDV-PAV. Aphids are polymorphic species, having both winged and nonwinged adults. Gildow (1980 Gildow ( , 1983 has shown that R. padi and S. avenae adults are winged with significantly higher frequency when feeding on BYDV-infected plants. Furthermore, S. avenae adults were found (in separate experiments) to be more frequently winged when feeding on B YDV-PAV-infected plants than when feeding on BYDV-MAV-infected plants (Gildow, 1980) . Power et al. (1991) point out that the competitive benefits of such viral-induced changes may include increased vector dispersal, which may therefore provide BYDV-PAV with a transmission advantage over B YDV-MAV.",

Competition between two viral taxa for an obligate but finite resource (niche component) can and does eventually result in exclusion of one by the other, as demonstrated above in Clarke and colleagues' (1994) research. However, intertaxonomic competition in the presence of more than one fundamental niche may result in alteration (including expansion or contraction) of the niches used by the individual competing populations. Niches can be differentiated by resource partitioning, in which coexisting populations evolve the ability to utilize different resources, thereby avoiding direct competition.

(1997) , proteins derived from endogenous retrovirus genes may act as replication inhibitors of similar exogenous agents by blocking host cell receptors. This has been observed in the case of the Fv-4 gene of mice, which originated from an endogenous retrovirus. Fv-4 is an envelope protein that appears to prohibit infection by potentially pathogenic ecotropic murine leukemia viruses by binding to host cell surface receptors, thereby preventing fusion and entry of other, closely related virus types (Kozak et al., 1984; Weiss, 1993) . This type of effect is also thought to occur in the chicken ev-3 gene, also of retroviral origin, which blocks the cell receptors used by Rous-associated virus-O (Crittenden et al., 1974) .",

In the late eighteenth century, Edward Jenner demonstrated how humans exposed to relatively avirulent cowpox were resistant to infection with its more deadly relative, smallpox virus (Jenner, reprinted in 1959) .

Interviral recombination and reassortment generate diversity in infecting viral populations and thus, in addition to mutation, represent mechanisms that produce the phenotypic raw material upon which selection acts. The evolutionary role of genetic exchange differs from mutation, however, in that exchange allows for more rapid and extreme evolutionary modification. In other words, the sequence space of an organism can be thought of as every possible combination of nucleotides in its genome (e.g., 4 v possible genome sequences may exist, where v is the genome length). Most of these potential genome compositions are not biologically viable and are thus never observed in nature. Likewise, other gene combinations may allow viral replication but only under specific circumstances determined by environmental conditions that may or may not exist at a given time. Still other genetic progeny may exhibit very efficient and successful replication (comparatively), therefore possessing high fitness and existing (symbolically) near the top of a fitness or adaptive peak.",

This is because the probabilistic attributes of the mutational process preclude quick and prodigious alteration of the genome and will usually produce small stepwise changes that correspond to movement of short distances through sequence space. Therefore, once a genome has \"summitted\" an adaptive peak, any other small motion would constitute a decrease in fitness --an improbable occurrence save for the effects of random drift. General movement through adaptive landscapes is discussed more thoroughly and eloquently by Wright (1931 Wright ( , 1932 Wright ( , 1982 , Kauffman and Levin (1987) , and Coyne et al. (1997) . The specific adaptive landscape of viruses is also discussed by Chao (1994 , Eigen and Biebricher (1988) , and Domingo and Holland (1997) .

Of greatest evolutionary significance is the generation of recombinants that exhibit phenotypes that differ from both (all) individual viral parents.

Mixed infections in the laboratory between parent viruses whose replication might otherwise be restricted to infection of only one or another cell type will frequently result in production of viral recombinants capable of replication within both cell types. As an example, using mixed infections of lepidopteran cell lines, Kondo and Maeda (1991) developed recombinants between various NPVs that subsequently exhibited expanded host ranges. The outcome was that coinfection of Bombyx mori NPV (BmNPV) with Autographa californica NPV (AcMNPV) resulted in recombinants that could replicate in previously nonpermissive cell types. Another example is provided by the efforts of Spector et aL (1990) , who found that experimental coinfection of HIV and a murine amphotropic retrovirus resulted in HIV pseudo-types capable of infecting both CD4-human cells and mouse cells.

(1995a Robertson et al. ( ). et al., 1992 Robertson et al., 1995a,b; Jin et al., 1994; Louwagie et al., 1995; McCutchan et al., 1996; Sabino et al., 1994; Salminen et al., 1997; Dornburg, 1997) . Such phylogenetic disparities indicate that many lentivirus genomes are actually \"mosaics\" representing the products of hybridization events between distinct viral types. These interactions then gave rise to the evolutionarily successful (\"new\") viruses we observe today, perhaps exhibiting aggregate or even novel phenotypes.",

Phylogenetic analysis has revealed how recombination in these viruses has resulted in the acquisition and exchange of genes (and traits) between different viral types, which has given rise to many evolutionarily successful taxonomic groups which persist today. Strauss (1993) has shown how western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) is actually a recombinant between eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) and Sindbis virus. The recombination is manifest biologically not only in the pathogenicity of WEEV, which is similar to that of EEEV, but also in the virus's vector specificity (Culex mosquitoes), which differs from that of EEEV (Culiseta mosquitoes).",

            "text": "Mutation is not only a frequently inadequate method of generating requisite evolutionary diversity, it also has the potential, when coupled with random genetic drift, to cause significant decreases in fitness. Following a drastic reduction in population size, the probability of fixation of deleterious mutations (which occur with much higher frequency than advantageous ones) is enhanced by the improbability of subsequent reversions (Haigh, 1978; Chao, 1991) and a lack of restorative mechanisms (Muller, 1964) . This is termed \"Muller's ratchet\" since mutations in subsequent (colonizing) populations are accumulated in an irreversible fashion similar to the advance of a ratchet (Muller, 1964) . The end-result is a decrease in fitness caused by an increasing mutational load, and this has been observed in numerous viral systems in vitro. Significant fitness decreases following plaque-toplaque transfers (bottlenecks) have been demonstrated for VSV (Duarte et al., 1992 (Duarte et al., , 1993 , RNA phage ~6 (Chao, 1990; Chao et al., 1992) , FMDV , as well as in the DNA-based cellular microorganism, Salmonella typhimurium (Andersson and Hughes, 1996) . Viral bottlenecks occurring in nature have been investigated to a limited extent (see Domingo et al., 1985; Gebauer et al., 1988) , but their frequency is most likely common during certain host-host transmission events and intrahost colonization of secondary replication sites Domingo et al., 1996) . In viruses susceptible to the effects of Muller's ratchet due to transmission dynamics or other aspects of their host colonization biology, genetic exchanges via recombination and reassortment may represent a \"buffer\" that prevents population fitness loss due to an otherwise extensive accumulation of deleterious mutations. This mechanistic \"relief valve\" has been suggested as a selective determinant supporting the evolution and maintenance of genetic exchange in RNA viruses by Chao (1991 Chao ( , 1992 and Chao and colleagues (1992) .",

Although largely ignored as an ecological interaction, genetic exchange in viruses is a process that involves extremely close association (coinfection of a single cell) between individual viruses whose phylogenetic relationship may be somewhat arbitrary. This interaction has the potential to influence the evolutionary path of the existing viruses and even the power to create new viral taxa. The degree and direction of the resulting evolutionary change is intimately dependent on the virus types involved, the conditions of the interaction, both host and virus population characteristics, other coevolutionary interactions, as well as many other probabilistic components.",

The primary basis of this shortcoming is the representational scope of scientific data that exists for viral taxa. As is apparent by our recurrent use of specific virus types in illustration (e.g., HIV), there is a clear overrepresentation of information on viruses that (1) infect humans or economically important biota and (2) are pathogenic. The skewed distribution of data type may be an inaccurate representation of the \"viral universe\" that exists on our planet. Therefore, while the existent virology literature may be immense and thus allow elucidation of amazing phenomena, our knowledge about chemistry, biology, and evolution will certainly be enhanced by investigation of new and unusual viruses. This limitation also precludes the types of large-scale generalizations about virus biology and evolution that can occasionally be made regarding other organisms.",
