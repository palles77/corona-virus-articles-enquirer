Recently, clinicians in the Barcelona area reported domestic ferrets with clinical signs and visceral lesions similar to those in cats with FIP. In 2004^5, tissues from ferrets a\u00a1ected by this novel disease were submitted to our laboratory.

(1) The number of neutrophils among in\u00a2ltrating cells in necrotizing lesions in cats have been found to vary greatly between studies (Kipar et al., 1998a; Berg et al., 2006) , whereas when neutrophils occurred in the present study they were always abundant. As a result of this observation, a new granuloma category was established, namely granulomas with neutrophils. This suggests that neutrophils may have an important pathogenic role in ferrets.",

Additionally, granulomatous in\u00a3ammation with necrosis and lipid accumulation was seen in the lymph nodes of two other ferrets. In three of these four cases, IHC revealed viral antigen in macrophages associated with these lesions. Despite the small number of animals with such lesions, these observations may indicate that some ferrets have a natural predisposition to develop granulomatous lesions with accumulation of lipids, not necessarily associated with coronavirus infection. Consistent with this interpretation, endogenous lipid pneumonia has been related to a non-speci\u00a2c response to injury compounded by as yet unknown inherent species-dependent factors (Dungworth, 1993) . (3) Granulomatous necrotizing vasculitis was observed less frequently than in cats. It is possible, however, that the granulomatous lesions were so extensive and severe in the ferrets that the vascular structures could not be detected.",

Possibly, unlabelled macrophages contained only minimal amounts of virus, or reduced numbers of macrophages decreased the likelihood of detecting viral antigen (Kipar et al.,1998a) . It should be emphasized that, as in cats, the di\u00a1erent types of lesion previously described and the viral antigen expression varied within the same animal and even within the same organ. It has been hypothesized that recurrent bouts of monocyte-associated viraemia with development of new lesions in each viraemic phase is responsible for this variation (Kipar et al., 2005) . Such a hypothesis might explain the negative IHC results in ferret 4, in which lesions consistent with coronavirus infection were observed. In our opinion, because this animal had probably su\u00a1ered previous bouts of coronavirus viraemia, the quantity of virus present was minimal in the \u00a2nal stage of the disease when the animal was killed. Studies on FIP suggested that the examination of many more granulomatous tissue sections might have revealed occasional antigen-positive macrophages in occasional granulomas.",

In the present study, the primary antibody used for IHC was FCV3-70, which is known to react with feline, canine, porcine and ferret coronaviruses (Kipar et al.,1998a,b; Williams et al., 2000) . Canine and porcine coronavirus have not been reported to produce granulomatous lesions in heterologous species and FECV has been reported to produce epizootic catarrhal enteritis in only one such species, namely the ferret (Williams et al., 2000; Wise et al., 2006) . There would seem to be three possible explanations for the presence of coronavirus antigen in the granulomatous lesions described in this report: an infection by FCoV; an infection by a mutated FECV (as in the case of FCoV in cats); or infection by an unknown coronavirus. Further research is therefore required to clarify the type of coronavirus responsible for the appearance of these lesions in ferrets.",
