This study aimed to elucidate the biological risk and pollution history of PAHs by measuring the concentrations of 28 PAHs in the surface and core sediments, respectively, in Nansha mangrove. Results found that the biological risk of PAHs was low without obvious spatial variation. The PAH concentration along the depth gradient indicated that PAH pollution was stabilized since the early 1990s while the source of PAHs has gradually changed from combustion of coal to petroleum products. This implied that the mitigation measures taken by the Chinese government were effective. Compared to marine bottom sediment, we propose that using mangrove sediment can provide a more accurate and precise estimate of pollution history of PAHs.",

The Pearl River Delta (PRD), in particular, has become the most populated and economically dynamic region in China since the late 1970s (Wang et al., 2011) . Meanwhile, the rapid economic development has made China become the biggest coal and petroleum consumer worldwide (NBSC, 2005) , generating a substantial amount of pollutants to the environment. Among various pollutants, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are of special concerns due to their toxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity to living organisms, as well as their persistence in the environment (Tam et al., 2001; Zheng et al., 2002; Xu et al., 2006; Sehili and Lammel, 2007; Zhang and Tao, 2009) . In light of the elevated number of factories, vehicles and power plants in the PRD since the late 1970s (Zhang et al., 2013a) , PAH pollution has deteriorated gradually via combustion of fossil fuel and discharge of petroleum products. To eradicate PAH pollution, efforts were made by the Chinese government, such as promoting energy-saving coal and replacing coal with petroleum or natural gas, from the early 1990s onwards (Wang, 2002; NBSC, 2005; Xu et al., 2006) . The effectiveness of these measures by monitoring PAH pollution over time has, however, not been extensively studied.",

As such, the pollution history of PAHs can be retrieved by analyzing the PAH concentrations in sediment along the depth gradient as long as the sedimentation rate is known (Hites et al., 1977) . This monitoring technique for PAH pollution has been applied in numerous studies but mostly using marine bottom sediment (Lima et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2005; Azoury et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013b) . Nevertheless, using mangrove sediment to reflect pollution history of PAHs may be more promising since the high organic matter and anoxic condition in mangrove sediment can facilitate the adsorption of PAHs (Tam et al., 2001; Ke et al., 2005) . On the other hand, mangrove sediment can potentially lead to over-accumulation of PAHs owing to its strong adsorption capacity (Nagelkerken et al., 2008) , the biological risk of PAHs should not be overlooked.",

The study site was uniformly divided into 20 sampling points along the Island with a distance of about 100 m between two consecutive sampling points ( Fig. 1) . At each sampling point, three random replicates of surface sediment samples were collected by a rectangular sampler (10 cm long \u00c2 10 cm wide \u00c2 15 cm deep). To evaluate the pollution history of PAHs, three core sediment samples were randomly collected by a PVC core (10 cm in diameter \u00c2 66 cm deep) at sampling points N5, N10 and N15 (Fig. 1) . According to the previous results of 210 Pb dating, the sedimentation rate in the study area is approximately 2 cm yr \u00c01 (Chen and Luo, 1991; Zhang et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2010) . Hence, the sediment samples in each core were cut into 33 layers from the top at 2 cm depth interval by a PVC knife to represent the pollution history from 1979 to 2011. All the samples were put into an ice box, transported to laboratory and finally stored at \u00c020\u00b0C before analyses.",

The spatial variation of PAHs is illustrated in Fig. 3 . The total concentration of 28 PAHs, ranging approximately from 330 ng g \u00c01 to 1270 ng g \u00c01 , highly fluctuated from N1 to N20 with a slightly decreasing trend (Fig. 3a) .

The wider river between N1 and N13 than between N14 and N20 led to slower water flow. As a result, more PAH-laden sediment or organic matter in the water could deposit in the mangrove sediment (Yang, 2000; Santschi et al., 2001) . This also explains why a weak positive correlation was found between TOC and total concentration of PAHs. Apart from high TOC, the silty sediment in Nansha mangrove can also facilitate the sorption of PAHs in view of the high surface area to volume ratio . Nevertheless, the fluctuation of PAHs with high precision indicated that the sources of PAHs in the mangrove were rather localized. ",

In other words, adverse effects are rarely observed if the concentration is lower than ERL. The 16 USEPA priority PAHs are of special concern due to their persistence and toxicity, and therefore they have been conventionally used to evaluate the anthropogenic impact on the environment (Pereira et al., 1996; Tolosa et al., 1996) . Although Long et al. (1995) only reported 13 PAHs in which 12 of them are USEPA prioritized, the total concentration of 28 PAHs in the present study (max. 1650 ng g \u00c01 ) was still far lower than the ERL of the total 13 PAHs (4022 ng g \u00c01 ).

The total concentration of PAHs gradually increased from \u00c066 cm to \u00c038 cm, representing the PAH pollution from 1979 to 1991. During that period, the demand of energy surged for economic development, leading to the concomitant increase in combustion of coal and hence total concentration of PAHs. On the other hand, many factories in Hong Kong moved to China, especially the PRD, during the 1980s to 1990s (Tanner et al., 2000) . The elevated number of vehicles and factories in the PRD could consequently increase the total concentration of PAHs (Xu et al., 2006) . Since then, the Chinese government has tightened the emission standard of PAHs, and therefore the increase ceased at \u00c038 cm and the total concentration of 28 PAHs fluctuated at around 1000 ng g \u00c01 from \u00c038 cm to \u00c02 cm. There were three dramatic drops at \u00c028 cm, \u00c016 cm and \u00c08 cm, which were approximately corresponding to the years 1998, 2004 and 2008, respectively. China was crisis-stricken in these years (e.g. Asian Financial Crisis in 1997; outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003; Global Financial Crisis in 2008) (Wang et al., 2011; Wei, 2013) , culminating in reduced productivity and hence emission of PAHs in the PRD. Based on these results, we suggest that using mangrove sediment can provide a precise and accurate pollution history of PAHs, probably ascribed to higher sedimentation rate and closer proximity to the source. Compared to subtidal environments (e.g. Liu et al., 2005, 0 .61 cm yr \u00c01 ), the higher sedimentation rate in mangrove habitats (2 cm yr \u00c01 ) can greatly minimize the sampling error (i.e. cutting the core sediment into layers) caused by annual variation of sedimentation rate.",

The findings herein unequivocally demonstrated that the source of PAHs changed over time, indicated by change of Fl/(Fl + Py) along the depth gradient, implying. The decrease in Fl/(Fl + Py) from 0.55 at \u00c066 cm to 0.47 at \u00c02 cm suggests that the source has gradually changed from combustion of coal to petroleum products from 1979 to 2011. Such change generally matches the energy source policy in Guangdong province in which biomass and coal were substituted by natural gas or petroleum as the major source of energy for heating facilities since 1990s (Xu et al., 2006) . It is estimated that such heating facilities, which are expected to cover up to 40% in China by 2010 (National Development and Reform Committee, 2004), could not only reduce approximately 49 million tons of coal per year, but also reduce 1850 tons of annual PAH emission (Xu et al., 2006) . This could further explain why the total concentration of PAHs was relatively stable in the early 1990s and even lower in the 2000s.",

Previous studies generally concluded that HMW PAHs are generated by high temperature combustion, including vehicle emissions and power generation (O'Connor and Lauenstein, 1996) . For instance, the aerosols produced by high temperature combustion in vehicles contain high proportion of HMW PAHs (Liu et al., 2005; Okuda et al., 2010) . The dominance of HMW PAHs in Nansha mangrove, therefore, corroborated the proposition that combustion of fuel in power plants and vehicles was the major source of PAHs in Guangdong province (Bi et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2006) . Furthermore, the low proportion of LMW PAHs could be due to the degradation by anaerobic bacteria as LMW PAHs are more readily degraded than HMW PAHs (Qiu et al., 2009) . Although HMW PAHs are less resistant to photo-oxidation (Garrett et al., 1998) , they were protected by the shading provided by the mangrove plants. All of the aforesaid reasons explained why HMW PAHs prevailed in Nansha mangrove.",

Such depth profile has been widely recorded (reviewed in Venkatesan, 1988) . Silliman et al. (2001) suggested that the anoxic condition and higher content of recalcitrant organic matter in the deeper sediment promote the dominance of perylene-forming microorganisms which are out-competed by other microorganisms in the surface sediment. The biogenic origin of perylene in the present study was further substantiated by the high ratio of perylene to total penta-PAHs (0.66-0.91) (Baumard et al., 1998) . Nevertheless, the concentration of perylene highly fluctuated from \u00c030 cm to \u00c02 cm, dictating the overall pattern of the total PAH concentration (e.g. three sudden drops simultaneously observed at \u00c028 cm, \u00c016 cm and \u00c08 cm). Therefore, anthropogenic origins of perylene, which could be from incineration, oil refining and fossil fuel combustion (Venkatesan, 1988; Silliman et al., 2001) , have also played a role in the pollution history of PAHs in Nansha mangrove.",
