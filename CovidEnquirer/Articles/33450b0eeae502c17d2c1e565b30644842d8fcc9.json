Removal of plastic-adherent cells, including the majority of B cells, did not change these activities. The plastic-non-adherent cells were further separated into two subsets of roughly similar size by panning using a monoclonal, anti-T, and anti-null cell antibodies (81 + cells). NK activity and IFN production were found in the 81cell fraction. A significantly higher proportion of null lymphocytes from blood and of splenic Fcgamma receptor-bearing lymphocytes was also found among the 81 -cell fraction as compared to the 81 + fraction, without any change among other subsets. Similar proportions of helper ( PT4 + ), cytotoxic (PT8+) and total T cells (MSA4+) were found among lymphocytes bound to target K562 cells and among the whole lymphocyte population. In contrast, lymphocytes that bound K562 cells demonstrated a striking increase in the proportion of Fc-gamma receptor-positive cells of high affinity. These results show that NK cells and IFN-producing cells are mainly included in the same blood and spleen fraction, and suggest that among 81 -cells only those expressing an Fc-gamma receptor of high affinity are active.",

However, NK activity against the tumor cell line K562 was not detected in either whole cell or in plastic-adherent depleted spleen cells of germ-free or specific-pathogenfree pigs (Kim et al., 1980) . In contrast, Takamatsu and Koide (1985) described NK activity in conventional pig spleen from either whole cells isolated on a Ficoll/Triosil gradient or from populations depleted of plastic-adherent cells, with a higher activity among spleen than among blood cells. More recently, Yang and Schultz ( 1986 ) did not find NK activity in conventional pig spleens.",

Thus, in pigs as in other species (review by Welsh, 1984) exogenous alpha-IFN increases NK activity (Chung et al., 1982; Charley et al., 1983; Lesnick and Derbyshire, 1988 ) and, in humans, a positive feedback exists in one (Timonen et al., 1980; Djeu et al., 1982) or two lymphocyte subsets (Minato et al., 1980) . In mice, all types of spleen cells are capable of secreting IFN after influenza induction (Ito et al., 1978) . We showed previously that a monoclonal antibody 81B reacted with a specific surface antigen expressed on a fraction of T and null lymphocytes (Kelley et al., 1984 (Kelley et al., , 1988 , the distribution of which was similar to that of a suppressor PT8+ cell (Pescovitz et al., 1984 ) . In this report, a specific panning technique (Mage et al., 1977 ) was used to show that 81-lymphocytes from both blood andspleen include the lymphocyte population exhibiting NK activity and viral-induced IFN production.

In the blood (Fig. 2B ) , the same lytic activity was achieved with the same E:T ratio for both 81 -and plastic-nonadherent cells: 81 + cells exhibited a questionable activity.

Differences in spleen cell preparation procedure might explain why others have not detected NK activity in swine spleen cells (Kim et al., 1980; Yang and Schultz, 1986) . Although removal of phagocytic cells from blood increased NK activity, such a treatment was inefficient with spleen cells, due to a very low proportion of phagocytic cells in the original spleen cell preparation. In both organs, NK and IFN activities were caused by lymphocytes. Moreover, the plastic adhesion step showed that neither SIg+, nor C3B +, B-cells (i.e., that subset of SIg+ cells bearing stable membrane immunoglobulin, Salmon, 1979) were active, a result in accordance with the phenotype of human NK cells (Tedder et al., 1983) . The lymphocyte subset responsible for NK and IFN activity must therefore be included in the T, L or null lymphocytes, such subsets being defined by the presence of surface receptors leading to rosette formation; T cells include SRBC rosette-forming cells (some of which expressed an FcR of low avidity) and null lymphocytes (Binns, 1982) . However, determination of the precise lineage of these subsets is largely dependent on the sensitivity of the technique used. Although our previous results indicated that EA-RFC were independent of T cells as judged by SRBC rosetting (Salmon, 1979) , results of this study indicate that a large fraction of EA-RFC exhibit the MSA4 antigen. In addition, the MSA4 antigen has been detected on 50% of B cells, although at a lower density (Lunney and Pescovitz, 1989 ) .",

Alternatively, the observation can be explained on the basis of either a minute contamination of 81 \u00f7 cells by 81-cells or of 81 \u00f7 cells being at a different stage of differentiation (Reynolds and Ortaldo, 1987) . Since IFN has been reported to act as an internal positive feedback mechanism in the activation of NK cells (Timonen et al., 1980) , it could be argued that 81 \u00f7 cells do not lyse K562 cells due to the absence of IFN-producing cells; however, this hypothesis is not tenable as mixing 81 \u00f7 and 81 -cells did not result in an enhanced activity of 81 -cells.",

Only a drastic enrichment of plastic-non-adherent FcR \u00f7 cells was found, suggesting that the Fc-gamma receptor is a specific marker of NK cells. This conclusion is in accordance with our results of enhanced NK activity of spleen 81 -cells, which were enriched two-fold as compared with the original cell suspension. Since we showed earlier (Salmon, 1979 ) the independence of FcR \u00f7 cells from the SRBC rosetting cells, these results agree with the general view that pig NK cells are non-SRBC rosetting T cells (Koren et al., 1978; Norley and Wardley, 1983; Yang et al., 1987) . In contrast to observations made on NK activity against TGE virus-infected cells (Cepica and Derbyshire, 1986 ), we did not find any increase in the proportion of cells with Fc-gamma receptor of low avidity among 81 -cells. The presence of granular lymphocytes among conjugates is at variance with the results from Yang et al. (1987) and agrees with the general view that granular lymphocytes in humans, mice and rats are effector cells for NK activity (Savary and Lotzova, 1986) . However, granular lymphocytes were also found among non-active 81\u00f7 cells of spleen, which suggests that there are functional subsets of granular lymphocytes.",
