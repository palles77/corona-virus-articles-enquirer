Methods: The M. pneumoniae genotype was determined by PCR and sequencing of the p1 and 23S rRNA genes from induced sputum samples and nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS). Samples were obtained from children with CAP who were hospitalized in 13 healthcare centers. In addition, a spatio-temporal analysis was performed to identify the potential risk areas and clustering of the cases over time.",

At the same time, these regions are recombined with similar regions outside the p1 gene, thereby generating the V1, V2a, V2b, V2c, and V2d variants. It is possible that changes in the p1 gene are associated with antigenic variation of the cellular surface of M. pneumoniae, which can favor evasion from the immune response and generate cyclic pattern in the infections, as well as triggering outbreaks (Razin et al., 1998; Kenri et al., 1999) .",

            "text": "No mutations associated with macrolide resistance were found in the sequences of the 23S rRNA gene obtained in this study. This finding is consistent with those of studies reported from countries such as Denmark (1-3%) and Germany (1-3%), as well as the Netherlands and Thailand, where the resistance rate is zero (Spuesens et al., 2012; Jacobs, 2012; Dumke et al., 2010b) . However, the results are in contrast to those reported from certain Asian countries, where the percentage of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae has been high, with rates above 90% in some studies (Zhao et al., 2013) . In those countries, the rates of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates with lower sensitivity to penicillin are also high, which could be a consequence of the excessive use of antibiotics as empirical treatment for respiratory infections, mainly in children (Kawai et al., 2013; Saraya et al., 2014; B\u00e9b\u00e9ar et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2013) . The relationship between previous exposure to macrolides and the development of resistance to these antibiotics in M. pneumoniae has been addressed by several authors. Winchell et al. reported that the administration of macrolides during the 13 days prior to study enrollment was higher in patients with resistant strains (71%) than in patients with sensitive strains (23%) (Diaz et al., 2015b) , results that were similar to those found by Kawai et al. (2013) . In the present study, the prior administration of antibiotics for more than 72 h was an exclusion criterion for patient recruitment; therefore, the children included in this study were not significantly exposed to macrolides, which could explain, in part, the absence of mutations associated with macrolide resistance. Indeed, the percentage of those receiving macrolides during the week before enrollment did not exceed 4.5%",

            "text": "(1/22). Three aspects of this study should be highlighted. First, the results showed the superiority of the induced sputum sample over the NPS sample (78.0%, 57/73 vs. 45.2%, 33/73) for obtaining a positive PCR result for the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae, results very similar to those of other authors (Herrera et al., 2016; Collier and Clyde, 1974; Cho et al., 2012; R\u00e4ty et al., 2005) . Second, the variability of the sensitivity of the different PCR protocols used on induced sputum was notable. These differences could have been due to the diversity of the amplified regions in the different genes, or to the different conditions under which the PCR was performed. In the case of the 23S rRNA gene, the sensitivity varied between 72.6% and 90.7% (Spuesens et al., 2012; Eshaghi et al., 2013; Yamada et al., 2012) , and for the p1 gene, the variation was much higher, from 21% up to 90% (Thurman et al., 2009; Ratliff et al., 2014) . Third, a significant number of cases were diagnosed only by paired serology (n = 15); all PCR assays were negative. This can be explained by problems in the sensitivity of the PCR protocols or because many of these infections were subclinical. In these cases, the M. pneumoniae infection could have been added to the real causative agent of the CAP (another respiratory pathogen, such as a virus or other bacterium), although the percentages of mixed infection were similar in this group and in the patients showing any positive PCR. Considering the aspects mentioned regarding the PCR techniques for M. pneumoniae, especially as the paired serology could have detected cases that were not found by PCR (15/73 = 20.5%), and because the serological approach is not practical since it requires two measurements (one in the acute phase and one in the convalescent phase of the disease), the design of better diagnostic tests, the redesign of current tests, or the identification of new molecular targets is imperative. This should be done through appropriately validated studies in diverse groups of patients and with different clinical and epidemiological conditions.",
