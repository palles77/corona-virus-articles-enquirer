Nearpatient assays allow establishment of the diagnosis within minutes in young children, and this study aimed to evaluate near-patient assays in relation to the patient's age. A total of 194 patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza A/H3N2 virus infection, diagnosed within a prospective cohort study, were included. Cryopreserved nasopharyngeal swabs collected from these patients were tested by four near-patient assays (Binax Now Influenza A&B, Quick S-Influ A/B, Influ-A&B Respi-Strip, and Actim Influenza A&B). The main outcome measure was sensitivity of the near-patient assays in relation to the age of patients. The Binax Now, Quick S-Influ, Influ-A&B Respi-Strip and Actim assays had overall sensitivities of 19%, 18%, 26%, and 40%, respectively. The estimated sensitivity for influenza A/H3N2 virus detection in nasopharyngeal swabs was 17-56% in children 1 year of age and decreased to 8-22% in patients 80 years of age (logistic regression). The sensitivity of the Influ-A&B Respi-Strip and Actim assays decreased significantly with increasing age (p 0.014 and p 0.033, respectively (logistic regression)), a trend for decrease was observed for the Binax Now assay (p 0.074 (logistic regression)), and the low sensitivity of the Quick S-Influ assay was similar in children and adults. Less than one-fourth of diagnosed influenza A/H3N2 virus infections can be identified in elderly patients using a near-patient assay. Consequently, near-patient assays are of limited value for confirming the diagnosis when influenza is clinically suspected in adults. Antiviral therapy and additional diagnostic procedures cannot be withheld on the basis of a negative near-patient assay result, particularly in adult patients.",

Elderly patients are most affected; that is, influenza-related deaths, hospitalizations and use of health services are recorded mostly for patients >65 years of age [2, 3] . The virus can spread particularly rapidly in care homes, potentially affecting 60% of residents [4] . Accurate and rapid diagnosis of influenza is essential for identification of contagious patients and effective management of cases of influenza. Management decisions regarding infection control, referral to specialized units, use of additional diagnostic procedures and administration of antiviral therapy have to be made at the point of first contact with the patient. The antiviral drugs oseltamivir and zanamivir are highly effective against influenza A and B viruses, but must be administered as soon as possible, at least within the first 48 h after the onset of the acute respiratory disease, to be effective [5, 6] .",

The inclusion criterion for the DINOE is an influenza-like illness (acute onset of fever with respiratory and constitutional symptoms) and that for the RNW is the clinical diagnosis of an acute respiratory tract infection including rhinitis, bronchitis and pneumonia. These two surveillance systems include patients of all age groups with acute respiratory tract infections. Nasopharyngeal swabs are taken by experienced physicians, with a swab being taken from both the nose and the throat of the patients. The swab content is tranferred into 1000 lL of transport medium consisting of minimal essential medium (MEM) (GIBCO; Life Technologies, Lofer, Austria) and discarded thereafter. All clinicians participating in the two surveillance systems were provided with transport medium by the Clinical Institute of Virology, Medical University of Vienna. Immediately after delivery, the clinical samples were vortexed vigorously, diluted in MEM (1 : 2), and split into aliquots before being screened for influenza A and B viruses by virus isolation or RT-PCR, or both.",

These specimens were collected from patients 1-101 years of age. The mean age of the children was 4.6 years (standard deviation (SD), 2.9 years) and that of the adults was 57.6 years (SD, 15.9 years). Seven of these patients were younger than 1 year and 20 were older than 80 years. The Binax Now Influenza A&B, Quick S-Influ A/B, Influ-A&B Respi-Strip, and Actim Influenza A&B had overall sensitivities of 19%, 18%, 26%, and 40%, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1 , the sensitivity of the three more sensitive assays decreased with increasing age of the patients, whereas the low sensitivity of the Quick S-Influ A/B assay was constant throughout all ages, from young children to elderly patients. The estimated probability of detecting influenza A virus in clinical specimens that tested positive according to RT-PCR was 17-56% in children 1 year of age, and decreased to 8-22% in patients 80 years of age. The sensitivity of the near-patient assays with comparably high overall sensitivity (Influ-A&B Respi-Strip and Actim Influenza A&B) decreased significantly with increasing age (Table 2) . A trend for lower sensitivity in adults was observed also for the Binax Now Influenza A&B. ",

The low sensitivity of nearpatient assays for the diagnosis of influenza, in comparison to virus isolation or RT-PCR, does not allow a reliable exclusion of the diagnosis of influenza. The present study supports the belief that antiviral therapy and additional diagnostic procedures should not be withheld in cases where influenza is clinically suspected on the basis of a negative near-patient assay, particularly in adult patients. On the other hand, the high specificity of near-patient assays, together with the advantage of results being available within 30 min, may provide important information for the clinical evaluation of patients with an acute respiratory illness, provided that the result of the near-patient assay is positive. Reliable and rapid identification of influenza cases is of particular importance in elderly patients. The age group >65 years is at high risk of a severe course of influenza; 90% of all influenza-related deaths occur in this age group [1] , and the estimated risk of influenza-related hospitalizations is 19-56 per 10 000 individuals during the influenza season [17] . Highly effective antiviral drugs are available for the treatment of influenza but must be administered within 48 h after onset of the disease and are effective only against influenza viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus co-circulates frequently with influenza viruses, causing a significant disease burden also in elderly patients, and the clinical features are difficult to distinguish from those of influenza [18] . The usefulness of near-patient assays is particularly low in the elderly. As a consequence, a considerable number of patients are treated unnecessarily and ineffectively with antiviral or antibacterial drugs, or are exposed to radiation due to additional diagnostic procedures. Therefore, the importance of annual vaccination against influenza, for elderly patients and their care-givers, cannot be overemphasized [19] .",

            "text": "In our previous study, the detection rate for influenza A viruses was clearly lower when testing respiratory specimens from adults than when testing specimens from young children, even with the use of highly sensitive assays such as RT-PCR [9] . The results of previous evaluations of nearpatient assay sensitivity, with regard to patient age, were discordant. Fader [12] noted a clear decrease in assay sensitivity with increasing age, whereas Weinberg and Walker [20] did not, although both studies evaluated the same assay (Binax Now; Binax Inc., Portland, ME, USA). The respiratory specimens used were heterogeneous (nasal washes, nasal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavages) and differed between the two studies. In adults, nasal washes are more convenient to collect than nasopharyngeal aspirates, but a diluting effect is inherent in this technique of sample collection and results in lower detection rates [20] . The strength of the present study is the use of comparable samples; all clinical specimens were collected with an identical technique by experienced and well-trained physicians, with the use of a standardized sampling kit. Furthermore, in vitro evaluation of near-patient assay sensitivity with the use of virus stock preparations could be confirmed by determination of the influenza A/H3N2 virus RNA concentrations in clinical samples. These features reduce the potential for bias and support the notion that the findings can be generalized. The present study also has limitations. Only samples positive for influenza A/H3N2 viruses were tested, for the purpose of standardization, and conclusions cannot be drawn concerning the sensitivity of near-patient assays for influenza A/H1N1 and B viruses. In the present study, the in vitro sensitivity of near-patient assays differed for influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and B viruses. Direct comparison of the in vitro sensitivities of near-patient assays with that of RT-PCR has to be made with caution, because of the use of cell culture-grown influenza strains. Cell culture preparations contain a considerable amount of defective virus particles. Different structures of these particles may be detected by use of near-patient assays and RT-PCR, and degradation of virus particles follows different kinetics in cell culture than in the human host. Furthermore, the assay was evaluated retrospectively in a virological laboratory, as in most previous studies [20, 21] . The laboratory setting allows a more standardized inter-assay comparison, but transfer of respiratory secretions into the medium used for preservation of virus and solubilization of mucus adds a dilution step that may reduce the detection rates achievable with nearpatient assays. In the present investigation, preservation of nasopharyngeal swabs in transport medium resulted in a final dilution of one log titre. This dilution effect cannot explain the differences in sensitivity observed between age groups or the differences among the four near-patient assays. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of near-patient assays for the diagnosis of influenza A/H3N2 virus infections may be expected to be somewhat higher when bedside testing is performed.",
