This study analyses the effect of the Ebola Virus Disease Epidemic (EVDE) on The Gambia, where, despite no reported cases, EVDE had devastating consequences. A Rapid Situation Analysis is used to gain insights into responses to the EVDE, encompassing interviews with key stakeholders, field observations and follow up meetings with those involved in managing the crisis over 21 months. A crisis and disaster framework is used to understand the challenges encountered. Findings highlight the importance of consumer perception and preparedness and management failures' consequences, contributing to the broader debate on the indirect threat of epidemics on tourism in developing countries.",

In recent years, many such crises have affected tourism (Breitsohl and Garrod, 2016) but despite the growth in the study of tourism crises, Mair, Ritchie, and Walters (2014) found that only four out of sixty-four studies conducted from 2000 to 2010 specifically related to health crises, while Jiang, Ritchie, and Benckendorff (2017) noted a focus on economic rather than health-related crises. Furthermore, the majority of these studies focused on crisis in developed countries. This study examines both the context in which the Ebola Virus Disease Epidemic (EVDElater referred to as 'Ebola') outbreak occurred and its effect on tourism in the small developing nation of The Gambia. Despite no reported cases, tourism receipts more than halved for the 2014/2015 season (International Monetary Fund, 2015; Gambia Tourism Board, 2015) , leading to what is referred to as the 'Ebola-induced tourism crisis' (EITC).",

Health related crises, such as epidemics, are prone to negative media coverage and graphic imagery, making them particularly challenging for the tourism sector to manage (Schroeder & Pennington-Gray, 2014) . The graphic images portrayed in media coverage, combined with a lack of the source markets' geographical knowledge of Africa, has led to the entire continent being 'generalised' as being risky. Furthermore, destinations may be unaffected directly by a crisis, but the consequence of being within its physical proximity (Henderson, 2007) , can create a 'spill over effect' with damaging consequences (Cavlek, 2002; Ritchie, Crotts, Zehrer, & Volsky, 2013) .",

As travel and tourism can facilitate the spread of epidemics, global bodies such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the UN World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) are increasingly interested in understanding the cause, evolution and risk of an infection (Joffe & Haarhoff, 2002; Mason, Grabowski, & Du, 2005; Page, Yeoman, Munro, Connell, & Walker, 2006) ; and advocating swift precautionary actions to reduce a health risk, often at the expense of complete scientific understanding (Sunstein, 2005) .",

Joffe and Haarhoff (2002) researched media depiction in the UK of an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and suggested that it was portrayed as an African health issue. Although previous cases of Ebola had occurred in Africa, the scale and impact had been contained with limited impact on the wider perception about whether it was safe to travel in the African continent (Joffe & Haarhoff, 2002) . The recent outbreak of Ebola in West Africa has had a different effect due to its scale and media attention. However, misrepresentation and public misconception about the geographical location of affected countries in Africa, negatively influenced international tourist arrivals to the entire African continent. Before the outbreak, Africa had experienced average increases in tourist arrivals of 5% per year in 2012 and 2013, but numbers were reduced by 2% in 2014 (UNWTO, 2015a), and a further 5% in October 2015 (UNWTO, 2015b) .",

Fear, loss of confidence in institutions, unpredictability and pervasive loss of safety may emerge during an epidemic (Rittichainuwat & Chakraborty, 2009) . While generally the media affects risk perception, an opposite reaction may occur as a result of a social process known as normalisation (Ananian-Welsh & Williams, 2014) . Existing literature states that repeated risk experience desensitises individuals to risk over time, as the concept appears normal, particularly with hazardous activities undertaken voluntarily (Ananian-Welsh & Williams, 2014; Breakwell, 2014) .",

Fletcher and Morakabati (2008) argue that tourists quickly return to destinations that have been touched by terrorism, as tourism demand is influenced by factors such as travel motivation, tourist type and tourism life cycle (Plog, 2001) . There does not appear to be any conclusive literature around the normalisation process and health epidemics. Health epidemics tend to be infrequent, yet can spread rapidly across geographical boundaries (i.e. SARS and influenza). Due to their infrequency and rapid spread, health epidemics can exert even more negative pressure on tourism demand than terrorism (Breitsohl and Garrod, 2016) . Regardless of type, all crises need appropriate management so that the destination and tourism businesses can respond, recover, learn lessons, improve future planning and implement effective strategies.",

Devising and implementing successful crisis management policies and strategies are complex, due to the fragmented nature of the tourism sector, political and social context of the crisis location, as well as the unique characteristics and duration of each crisis (Henderson, 2007; Prideaux, Laws, & Faulkner, 2003) .

Most tourism recovery strategies are reactive and generally include government aid packages; which (re)focus on domestic tourism and development of new niche tourism products, as well as cost-cutting measures by the sector as a result of a crisis (Tse et al., 2006; Enz & Taylor, 2002) . Finally, destination recovery is highly dependent on the perception of risk, a field that is crucial to understanding what is important for tourists in relation to personal safety and security (Lepp & Gibson, 2003; Reisinger & Mavondo, 2005; Taylor & Toohey, 2007; Williams & Bal\u00e1z, 2013; Yang & Nair, 2014) .",

Ritchie's (2004) framework ( Fig. 1 ) covers three main stages: (1) pre-crisis planning, (2) crisis response and recovery, and (3) resolution and future learning. While there are many parallels to Faulkner's TDMF, Ritchie's framework provides flexibility and feedback loops, recognising that diverse approaches are needed to manage crises; as each crisis differs in terms of impact, strategy and recovery period (Armstrong, 2008) . Further, Ritchie's (2004) model can be applied to both crises and disasters, while Faulkner's (2001) model was designed for tourism disaster management only. Ritchie's (2004) model is used in this paper as a framework to understand the response to the EITC in The Gambia across the crisis lifecycle, as well as what strategies were used and how this compares with suggested approaches.",

Tourism in The Gambia is seasonal with approximately three-quarters of all visitors arriving between November and April, and staying, on average, for seven nights (Bakker, 2011). Most visitors arrive on charter airlines, like Brussels Airlines and Thomas Cook. In 2014 and 2015, The Gambia's largest source market was the UK, which accounted for approximately 35% of all charter arrivals (Gambia Tourism Board, 2015) . Other key markets included the Netherlands, Sweden, Spain, and Germany. Nigeria was also developing into a significant regional source market (GTB, 2013 (GTB, -2015 supported by the regional Arik airline connection.",

In addition, periodic political instability, starting with the 1994 coup d'\u00e9tat and 22 years of subsequent dictatorship, and a more recent change in government in December 2016, has also impacted tourism. Despite these challenges, the destination has shown resilience and is widely perceived as more peaceful compared to other African destinations. In fact, Gambian tourism had been growing steadily before the regional Ebola outbreak (Table 1) , receiving 171,200 visitors in 2013, which was one of its most successful tourist seasons.

The EITC exacerbated underlying vulnerabilities of the tourism sector in The Gambia, which is historically linked to fragile socio-economic conditions, industry structure and limited product.

It had to formulate a containment and recovery strategy as the situation unfolded. At the start of the crisis, The Gambia's Ministry of Health implemented a series of initiatives to prevent Ebola from entering the country. Such measures, not only protect the local population, but help safeguard the destination's perceived safety, an important consideration for tourists in their decision making (Lepp & Gibson, 2003; S\u00f6nmez & Graefe, 1998; Taylor & Toohey, 2007) . Thus, the issue of perception, destination image and communication, had to be carefully considered in The Gambia's overall recovery strategy, especially when confronting images of Ebola being portrayed in the world media. The generalizability effect meant that the broader region, or even the whole continent, was negatively tarnished. Ritchie's (2004) CDMF provided a valuable framework to evaluate each phase of the EITC and to understand what occurred over the three main phases of the crisis. The benefits are the adaptability of the framework to reflect the specifics of each destination and crisis. This is especially important when considering the different issues faced by tourism stakeholders in developing countries, with related changes of emphasis to the framework suggested below.",

A regional and cross boarder approach to tourism crisis planning may be beneficial to help prevent spill over effects from future crises, and to improve the capabilities of governments and the tourism sector to respond in a coherent and co-ordinated manner to any crises. Collaboration is outlined as vital in Ritchie's (2004) CDMF for developing countries with limited resources and knowledge. This is especially important in both preparing for crises and managing their effects, an area that may require specific international donor agencies' support for technology and knowledge capacity building. In this case, the private sector took a key leadership role in altering and managing the crisis. Whereas in developed countries, tourism crisis management is often led by the government, thus suggesting the CDMF could be altered for developing countries, to ensure relevancy, engagement and commitment, crisis plans should also be prepared involving multiple stakeholders within a country. A well-structured plan and task force committee can assist in earlier detection, which generally results in better response and faster recovery. Once completed, the crisis plan should be reviewed regularly, with training provided to key stakeholders.",
