However, comparison of disease burden estimates obtained from surveillance systems in place in different countries may be limited by differences in the surveillance methodologies within these countries. Surveillance for infectious diseases is typically based in hospitals and other health care facilities. Hospital-based surveillance is an efficient form of surveillance as it captures the more severe manifestations of the illness of interest and usually includes a standardized collection of objective data such as physical exam findings and laboratory diagnostic testing, enabling better adherence to a standardized case definition. In contrast, communitybased surveillance -although less efficient and often more costly than hospital-based surveillanceenables earlier detection of the disease of interest and captures illnesses in persons who do not seek care in a hospital. Also, in many rural settings in developing countries, hospitals and other health care facilities may not be accessible to most persons living in a community due to the distance to the facility or the cost of care at such a facility.",

Objectives of pneumonia surveillance in the IEIP sites are to estimate pneumonia incidence, characterize the leading etiologies of pneumonia, and track disease trends over time. In addition to initiating surveillance for severe respiratory infections and other select illnesses, the IEIP sites also conducted health care utilization surveys in the larger community surrounding the surveillance hospitals. These surveys were used to inform planning and implementation of facility-based surveillance systems and as a tool to adjust crude calculations of incidence from surveillance data toward more accurate estimates of disease burden within communities under surveillance.",

Findings from several of these surveys have been published [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . In Guatemala one survey was conducted in the Department of Santa Rosa (pop. 308,522; 14% <5 years old), located in the southeastern part of the country, while the second survey was conducted in Quetzaltenango (pop. 705,301; 14% <5 years old), located in western Guatemala. The two Thailand sites were based in the agrarian, rural provinces of Sa Kaeo (pop. 509,337; 7% <5 years old), in eastern Thailand, and Nakhon Phanom (pop. 715,549; 8% <5 years old), located in the Northeast. The Kenyan sites included Kibera, an urban slum in Nairobi (Gatwikira and Soweto villages, pop. 29,015; 15% <5 years old), and Rarieda (formerly known as Bondo), a rural district in western Kenya (pop. 24,000; 15% <5 years old). Persons of all ages were included in the community surveys except those in Kenya, which were restricted to members of households with at least one child aged <5 years. The case definition of pneumonia used in the surveys was adapted from the World Health Organization (WHO) verbal autopsy report for severe pneumonia in children, using questions that were moderately sensitive and specific for pneumonia [9] . In Guatemala and Thailand, pneumonia was defined as self-reported cough and difficulty breathing for P2 days or diagnosis of pneumonia by a health care provider during the past 12 months. In Kenya, pneumonia was de-fined as cough and difficulty breathing for >2 days (Rarieda) or >5 days (Kibera) or diagnosis of pneumonia by a health care provider in the past 12 months, excluding the past two weeks. The rationale stated for excluding respiratory illness during the two weeks prior to interview was the hypothesis that respiratory illness episodes in the past two weeks were more likely to be reported and magnified in severity because they were still fresh in the minds of the respondents [10] .",

In Rarieda, Kenya, the previously reported pneumonia incidence was based on physician diagnosis listed in the admission log books [12] . In Thailand, previously reported pneumonia incidence was based on a standard surveillance definition (at least one sign or symptom of acute infection, at least one sign or symptom of lower respiratory tract infection and chest radiographic findings consistent with pneumonia) [4] . Rates were then adjusted using the percentage of children with pneumonia who visited a hospital for care. The subsequently adjusted rate assumes that all children meeting survey criteria for pneumonia were sick enough either to have been referred to a hospital or to have been admitted to a hospital.",

Nakhon Phanom, Thailand was the only study site where hospital-based care for children aged <5 years with pneumonia was sought less frequently than for persons aged 5 years or older. Data from a study comparing health care-seeking behavior for pneumonia in Nakhon Phanom and Sa Kaeo, Thailand found that children <5 years of age in Nakhon Phanom were more likely to have had an episode of pneumonia reported than their Sa Kaeo counterparts. This suggests that differences in health care-seeking behaviors among children <5 years may be attributed to perceived severity of illness or differences in accessibility of hospital care.

The health care utilization survey conducted in Rarieda indicated that using clinic-based surveillance alone to define disease rates would sufficiently underestimate pneumonia frequency, supporting the decision to implement home-based surveillance [5] . In contrast, hospital-based surveillance in Thailand continued unchanged, based primarily on the finding that the majority of persons with self-reported pneumonia sought hospital care.

Self-reported pneumonia is a difficult syndrome to standardize, and the surveys in these study may have captured milder acute respiratory illness syndromes that was not consistent with pneumonia, which might have led to an overestimate of the number of pneumonia cases missed by hospital-based surveillance. Conversely, recall of an illness in the previous 12 months may be difficult, especially if the illness was mild, therefore leading to underestimation of the number of persons with pneumonia who did not seek care at a hospital. Secondly, although the written definition of pneumonia was similar between sites, local interpretation may have been different, leading to across-site variability in what was being reported as pneumonia. Researchers in Kenya also used a different sampling scheme, limiting data collection to households with at least one child aged <5 years, which may have led to a bias in the sample of adults with respect to pneumonia prevalence and health care-seeking behaviors. Thirdly, various attention-grabbing outbreaks of respiratory disease, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), avian influenza A (H5N1) and 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) occurred during some of the study periods [20] [21] [22] [23] . While not necessarily increasing the frequency of pneumonia, these outbreaks may have increased awareness and thus reporting of respiratory disease; they also may have changed health care-seeking behaviors. Finally, surveys may have been influenced by whether respondents deemed a particular response to be the ''correct'' answer in the eyes of an interviewer working with the Ministry of Health or an international organization. Respondents may have been more likely to indicate that they would seek care at a clinic or hospital (even if they would not) or that they would not seek care from a traditional medicine provider (even if they would).",
