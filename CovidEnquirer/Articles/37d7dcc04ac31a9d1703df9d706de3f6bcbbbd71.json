After virus replication, mature particles are released from cells by lysis. Rotavirus replication is rapid and reaches high titres (up to 10 11 virus particles/ml faeces at the peak of acute diarrhoea) within a short period of time. The diarrhoea arises from epithelial necrosis and atrophy, leading to reduced absorption of carbohydrates and increased osmotic pressure in the gut lumen. Cells emerging from the crypts of the gut epithelium, which exhibit reactive hyperplasia, repair the damage to villous cells. This is accompanied by increased secretion of fluid, which also contributes to the diarrhoea. Recently, a viral non-structural protein (NSP4, encoded by RNA segment 10) was shown to be an enterotoxin (the first viral protein identified to exert this function). Furthermore, a toxic effect of rotavirus infection on the autonomous nervous system of the gut has been described.",
