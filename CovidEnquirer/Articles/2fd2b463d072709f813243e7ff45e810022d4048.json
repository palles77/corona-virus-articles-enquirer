Although EBN has been widely used for enhancing immunocompetence, its antiviral efficacy has not been studied in detail. We found that EBN extract could strongly inhibit infection with influenza viruses in a host range-independent manner when it was hydrolyzed with Pancreatin F. Western blotting assay showed that the EBN extract bound to influenza virus. Furthermore, EBN extract could neutralize the infection of MDCK cells with influenza viruses and inhibit hemagglutination of influenza viruses to erythrocytes, but it could not inhibit the activity of influenza virus sialidase. Fluorometric HPLC indicated that the major molecular species of sialic acid in EBN is N-acetylneuraminic acid. The results suggest that EBN is a safe and valid natural source for the prevention of influenza viruses.",

The composition of the swift's saliva resembles that of salivary mucin. Many studies have been carried out on the tonic effects of EBN, and it has been shown that EBN stimulates mitosis hormones and the growth factor for epidermal growth, resulting in repair of cells and stimulation of the immune system (Kong et al., 1987; Ng et al., 1986) . Recently, several carbohydrate molecules, including new sialic acid-containing compounds and glycoconjugates, have been detected in EBN (Pozsgay et al., 1987; Reuter et al., 1989; Wieruszeski et al., 1987; Kakehi et al., 1994; Martin et al., 1977; Yu-Qin et al., 2000) , but the importance of sialic acid residues in EBN is not clear.",

Peak 2 in panel c is much higher than that in panel b. After alkali hydrolysis with 1N NaOH for 3 h at 37 \u2022 C, peak 2 became lower and peak 1 became higher (panel d), indicating that the EBN extract from S2 has an O-acetyl sialic acid species. We further examined the linkages between nonreducing terminal sialic acid to Gal in the EBN extract using sialic acid-Gal linkage-specific lectins by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3B ). Since MAA (specificity for sialic acid terminally linked 2-3 to Gal in N-glycan and O-glycan) bound strongly to the EBN extract from S1 and weakly to the EBN extract from S2, it is possible that MAA can not bind to O-acetyl sialic acid to Gal linkage. On the other hand, SNA [specificity for sialic acid terminally linked 2-6 to Gal (or GalNAc) in N-glycan] did not react with either of the EBN extracts. These findings suggest that the sialyl-glycoconjugates of the EBN extract from S1 have Neu5Ac\u24232-3Gal linkages and that the EBN extract from S2 also have an O-acetylated Neu5Ac, while Neu5Ac is the major sialic acid species.

We determined the effects of the EBN extract on viruses propagated in chicken eggs and also on recent viruses [strains A/Shizuoka/450/05 and A/Shizuoka/451/05 (H3N2)] isolated from influenza patients in February 2005 and cultured in A549 cells, human lung carcinoma cells that express both sialyl \u24232-3 and \u24232-6 linkages. The inhibitory effects of the EBN extract on strains A/Shizuoka/450/05 and A/Shizuoka/451/05 (H3N2) were similar to those on other strains used in this study.",

Although Ou et al.

In this study, the proteins or peptides which had the best anti-influenza effect were some 10-25 kDa sialylglycoproteins of the EBN extract after with Pancreatin F. Although the proteins of over than 50 kDa (including a major allergen of 66 kDa) untreated with pancreatic enzyme could bind to influenza A virus, the neutralization against the virus infection not detected or was very low. Furthermore, the EBN extract showed no side effects, such as hemolysis and cytolysis, on erythrocytes and MDCK cells even at a higher concentration (4 mg/ml). Therefore, we think that the EBN extract (lower than 25 kDa) treated with Pancreatin F will become an effective and secure agent for anti-virus.",

(A) Binding of EBN extracts from S1 and S2 with strain A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) was detected by SDS-PAGE through a 10-15% polyacrylamide running gel and a Western blotting assay. The effects of Pancreatin F and neuraminidase treatment on EBN/virus binding activity were also determined. (A) Both EBN extracts were treated with Pancreatin F (final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml) at 45 \u2022 C for 4 h at pH 8.5-9.0. (B)",

Standard mixtures of Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc (a) and of the EBN extracts from S1 (b) and S2 (c and d) were treated as described in the Section 2. The fluorescence of DMB derivatives was detected at an excitation wavelength of 373 nm and an emission wavelength of 448 nm. (Panel d) EBN extract from S2 treated for 3 h at 37 \u2022 C with 1N NaOH, which hydrolyzes the O-acetyl residue of O-acetylated sialic acids. (B) Lectin blotting of the EBN extracts. EBN extracts from S1 and S2 (0.2 mg/lane) were examined. SDS-PAGE was performed with 10-15% polyacrylamide gels. Nitrocellulose transfers were incubated with MAA lectin specific for sialic acid \u24232-3 Gal or with SNA lectin specific for sialic acid \u24232-6 Gal on the N-glycan. That was visualized according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (glycan determination kit; Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany).",
