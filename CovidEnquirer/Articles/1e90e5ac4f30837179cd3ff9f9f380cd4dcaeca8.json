Intestinal contents or intestines from affected turkey poults and inoculated turkey embryos contained coronaviruses as revealed by electron microscopy or were positive for turkey coronavirus by immunofluorescent antibody assay. Sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation of the virus-containing intestinal homogenate yielded two opalescent bands corresponding to the buoyant densities of 1.14-1.15 and 1.18-1.20 g/ml, respectively. Coronaviral particles from intestinal contents or the sucrose density gradient preparation were mainly spherical in shape and had envelope and central depression. They were surrounded by a fringe of regularly spaced petal-shaped projections attached to the particles by a short stalk. Purified viruses hemagglutinated rabbit erythrocytes with a titer of 16. Major protein bands of purified viruses analyzed by SDS-PAGE were located at 200, 100-110, 50-60, and 30-35 kDa. The patterns of protein bands were consistent with those of Minnesota or Quebec turkey coronavirus isolates. A 568 bp nucleotide fragment of turkey coronavirus spike protein gene was amplified from RNA of inoculated turkey embryo intestine or purified virus. Sequence analysis of the 568 bp PCR product revealed high degree of identity with the corresponding spike protein gene sequence of human and bovine coronaviruses. The results indicated that turkey coronavirus was associated with turkey poults with acute enteritis. #",

Turkey coronaviral enteritis is characterized by anorexia, watery droppings, marked dehydration, and decreased body weight gain (Gonder et al., 1976) . Infection with TCV causes rapid histopathologic changes in the mucosa of the intestinal tract of turkeys. The major changes are the granularity of the epithelial cells, loss of microvilli, margination of chromatin in the nucleus, and increased cellularity of the lamina propria. These altered physical conditions of the mucosal cells cause failure of absorption, loss of appetite, and accumulation of fluids and gases in the intestinal tract, resulting in diarrhea Gonder et al., 1976) .",

Even at the present time, it remains a serious threat to the turkey producers in North Carolina. The estimated loss was reflected by mortality, decreased feed efficiency, stunting, and medication cost. The clinical signs of the turkey poult enteritis usually appear at 7-28 days of age and include inappetence, wet droppings, ruffled feathers, decreased weight gain, growth depression, and uneven flock growth. Analysis of intestinal contents from affected turkeys by electron microscopy (EM) at Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, Purdue University, often revealed the presence of coronavirus. The clinical signs of turkey poults with acute enteritis and the continuing finding of coronavirus were very similar to TCV-induced bluecomb disease of turkeys encountered in Minnesota in 1960 and 1970s. The purpose of the present study was to identify TCV isolate from the intestinal contents of turkey flocks with outbreaks of acute enteritis and characterize its morphological, serological, and molecular properties.",

Inoculation with the virus-containing filtrate from the intestinal homogenate did not kill turkey embryos. The intestinal tract of inoculated turkey embryos was more distended than that of normal turkey embryos. The intestinal contents were watery, gaseous, and greenish.

The intestines of affected turkey poults and inoculated turkey embryos were positive for TCV using turkey anti-TCV antiserum in IFA. The infected epithelial cells had intense bright immunofluorescent staining. For purification of virus, intestines of affected turkey poults or inoculated turkey embryos were homogenized with 5 volumes of TBS by mortar and pestle. After freeze and thaw for three times and sonication, the homogenate was centrifuged at 8000g for 20 min. The supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 100,000g for 3 h through a cushion of 15 ml of 30% sucrose solution. After resuspension of the pellet in TBS, the sample was layered on the top of 40-65% sucrose gradient and ultracentrifuged overnight at 100,000g. Fractions were collected from the bottom of the tubes and both absorbance and sucrose density of each fraction were determined.",

Because there were no BCV or HCV-OC43 in the laboratory during the present study, the opportunity of contamination with either BCV or HCV-OC43 was very unlikely. The positive RT-PCR reaction and sequence of the PCR product should reflect the nature of the isolated TCV instead of contamination of BCV or HCV-OC43. Nevertheless, a single nucleotide substitution from G to A was seen. Spike protein of coronavirus has been known to be important for receptor binding and penetration of target cells during the infection process. The single nucleotide substitution from G to A at position 482 may be involved in the mechanisms of different host tropism. Further study on molecular analysis of full-length S gene of TCV is required to elucidate such information as well as the genetic relationships among TCV, BCV, and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV).",
