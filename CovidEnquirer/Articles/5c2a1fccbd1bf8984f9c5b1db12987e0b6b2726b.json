PED, characterized by acute diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, has caused serious economic losses in pig industry worldwide. Here, we demonstrate that activation of a disintergrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) induced the decrease of PEDV infection in HEK293 and IPEC-J2 cells and the downregulation of cell surface aminopeptidase N (APN) expression, an important entry factor for PEDV infection. Furthermore, overexpression of ADAM17 suppressed PEDV infection in HEK293 and IPEC-J2 cells, whereas ablation of ADAM17 expression using ADAM17 specific siRNA resulted in a corresponding increase of PEDV infection and an upregulation of cell surface APN expression. Taken together, these data demonstrate that modulation of APN expression by metalloprotease ADAM17 regulates PEDV infection. Hence, the reduction in APN expression represents another component of the anti-PEDV infection response initiated by ADAM17.",

It is well known that Vero E6 cell is widely used for the isolation and passage of PEDV as well as the model for studies on virus pathogenesis in vitro. In addition, PEDV has also been confirmed to infect other kinds of cell lines, including PK15 cell (pig kidney), huh-7 cell (human liver), Tb1-Lu cell (bat lung) and so on (Liu et al., 2015) . However, Vero cell line is recognized to be unable to secrete type I interferon when infected with viruses, due to loss of the type I interferon gene cluster (Ding et al., 2014; Le Bon and Tough, 2002) . Therefore, Vero cells are not recommended as the ideal model to investigate viral infection-driven innate immune responses. Although porcine intestine epithelial cells are the target cells for PEDV infection in vivo, the immortalized porcine intestinal epithelial cell clone J2 (IPEC-J2) has a low susceptibility to PEDV infection in vitro Luo et al., 2017) . Our previous research has demonstrated that HEK293 cells can be efficiently infected by PEDV and APN is involved in the virus infection, which might provide a useful tool for understanding the fundamental mechanisms involved in PEDV infection in vitro . Moreover, HEK293 cells have been widely used in cell biology research for many years because of their reliable growth and propensity for transfection. Thus, the HEK293 cell as a new cell model is essential to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms of PEDV infection in vitro.",

We have reported previously that ADAM17 can regulate pig CD163, TNF\u03b1 and CD16 on the cell surface, playing an important role in modulating inflammation and infection of PRRSV Gu et al., 2015; Guo et al., 2014; Li et al., 2016) . However, whether and how this metalloprotease ADAM17 is involved in PEDV infection remains unknown. In this study, the role of ADAM17 on PEDV infection was examined in HEK293 and IPEC-J2 cells, and we found that modulation of APN expression as a consequence of ADAM17 sheddase activity regulates PEDV infection.",

In order to evaluate the involvement of ADAM17 on PEDV infection, HEK293 and IPEC-J2 cell monolayers were treated with a metalloprotease inhibitor BB94 or carrier control DMSO as previously described (Guo et al., 2014) . As shown in western blot, higher levels of PEDV N protein were detected in HEK293 cells with BB94 treatment than that with DMSO treatment (Fig. 1A) . Moreover, BB94 treatment significantly increased the virus titer compared to that in DMSO mock treatment (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1A) , suggesting that inhibition of ADAM17 activity facilitates PEDV infection. Meanwhile, a metalloprotease activator PMA was also introduced to examine the effect of ADAM17 on PEDV infection. As shown in Fig. 1B , PMA treatment downregulated the PEDV N protein expression in HEK293 cells and led to a lower progeny virus titer than control treatment (p < 0.05), indicating that the metalloprotease ADAM17 activation can inhibit PEDV infection. As was the case with HEK293 cells, PEDV infection of IPEC-J2 cells was upregulated by treatment with BB94 and was downregulated with activator PMA treatment as determined by TCID 50 (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1C) . To rule out the side effect of inhibitor or activator, the levels of endogenous ADAM17 expression were analyzed by western bot. The results showed that neither BB94 nor PMA had an effect on ADAM17 expression (Fig. 1D) , suggesting that the differences in PEDV infectivity are associated to ADAM17 activity. The inhibitory effect of ADAM17 on PEDV infection is similar to that on porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection (Guo et al., 2014; Li et al., 2016) .",

            "text": "It has been reported that ADAM17, one of the most important metalloproteases, is known to have a wide spectrum of substrates (Wang et al., 2013; Zunke and Rose-John, 2017) . We have previously verified that ADAM17 can regulate PRRSV infection by two different mechanisms. One is that PRRSV infection induced ADAM17-mediated TNF\u03b1 production, which in turn restricted PRRSV replication . The other one is that PRRSV entry was regulated by ADAM17 through modulating the expression of PRRSV receptor CD163 (Guo et al., 2014) . Since APN has been recognized as an important infection factor for PEDV entry (Oh et al., 2003) , we examined whether the regulation role of ADAM17 on PEDV infection is through the modulation of APN. Involvement of ADAM17-mediated APN modulation in PEDV infection was investigated in HEK293 cells, due to the low susceptibility of IPEC-J2 to PEDV infection . HEK293 cells were first treated with PMA and then transfected with a vector carrying APN protein, and cells were then infected with PEDV. As determined by TCID 50 , overexpression of APN increased the titer of PMA-treated cells, suggesting that APN complementation rescues the reduced PEDV infection in PMA treated cells (Fig. 3A) . HEK293 cells were seeded in 6well-plate in the presence or absence of inhibitor BB94 or activator PMA, and cells were then stained with anti-APN antibody. As shown by flow cytometric analysis, APN expression on cell surface was upregulated in HEK293 cells by BB94 treatment compared to that by the carrier DMSO treatment (Fig. 3B) ; and a decrease of APN expression was shown in HEK293 cells by PMA treatment (Fig. 3C) , which was consistent with the above results that ADAM17 can inhibit PEDV infection by modulating ADAM17 activity (Fig. 1) . Moreover, we also utilized overexpression and siRNA method to genetically modulate ADAM17 activity. Flow cytometry results showed that APN expression on the cell surface was downregulated in cells by ADAM17 overexpression (Fig. 3D) ; and the APN expression on the cell surface was (caption on next page) upregulated by ADAM17-specific siRNA treatment (Fig. 3E ).Taken together, we conclude that ADAM17 can modulate PEDV infection by regulation of the APN expression, an important entry factor for PEDV infection. Currently, ADAM17 has been well-studied and its activities refer to different involvements, including development, inflammations, immune responses, cancers, etc. (Zunke and Rose-John, 2017) . More and more studies have been addressed as ADAM17 mediated regulation effects on human diseases. Inhibition of ADAM17 by sorafenib controls the mesenchymal characteristics of retinal pigment epithelial cells infected with Epstein-Barr virus, suggesting that ADAM17 might serve as a new target for the prevention or control of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in retinal diseases . Fortunately, pharmacological inhibitors of ADAM17 have advanced in specificity and progressed to clinical trials for cancer (Duffy et al., 2011; Friedman et al., 2009; Mishra et al., 2017) . In addition, antagonist results have been introduced to investigate its role on infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). It was indicated that TAPI-2, an antagonist of ADAM17, blocks SARS-CoV infection and attenuates its severity of clinical outcome, implicating the possibilities of developing more useful and safer drugs for SARS-CoV treatment, such like potent antagonists (Haga et al., 2010) . Based on the research progress in ADAM17 prior and afterwards, relative useful drugs will be developed to defeat ADAM17 modulated virus infection as well as human diseases, such as cancers and inflammations.",

ADAM17-mediated APN modulation regulates PEDV infection in HEK293 cells. (A) HEK293 cells were treated with PMA for 30 min, and cells were then transfected with vector or APN for 24 h followed by PEDV infection. Virus titers were determined by TCID 50 . HEK293 cells were treated with inhibitor BB94 (B) and activator PMA (C) for 24 h and 30 min, respectively. All cells were then stained for surface expression of APN with mouse anti-APN antibody and detected by flow cytometry. Moreover, HEK293 cells were transfected with pCAGGS/ADAM17 (ADAM17) and pCAGGS vector control (D), or ADAM17-specific siRNA duplexes (siADAM17, 100 nM) and negative control siRNA (siNC) (E) as indicated. Levels of APN expression were determined by flow cytometry. Appropriate isotype negative control antibodies were selected as control. The data are the representatives from three independent measurements.",
