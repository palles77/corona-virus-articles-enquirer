In December 2013, CHIKV (Asian clade) was identified for the first time in the Western Hemisphere, on the Island of St Martin in the Caribbean [3] . From St Martin, an epidemic wave of CHIKV infection moved across the Caribbean and spread into virtually every country in the hemisphere, with >2.4 million cases reported to the Pan American Health Organization through the end of 2017 [4] . Although the CHIKV epidemic caused substantial morbidity, during the same time period (2013-2017) and in the same region >8.8 million dengue cases were reported to the Pan American Health Organization [5] , together with >800 000 suspected and confirmed ZIKV infections [5] , underscoring the magnitude and diversity of arboviral infections within the population.",

Studies have also tended to be cross-sectional, making it difficult to assess patterns of infection with different agents, data which are of potential importance in understanding drivers or facilitators for epidemic disease within the region.",

In 2012-2013, acute undifferentiated febrile infection (ie, subjective fever in a child with no localizing signs or symptoms) was the third most common presenting complaint at the clinic serving the Christianville schools, with a rate of 235 cases per 1000 child-years of observation [11] . In these 2012-2013 studies, diagnostic testing of children with AFI was limited to screening for malaria (approximately 6% of patients) and possible typhoid fever. In 2014, anticipating the imminent onset of the CHIKV epidemic in Haiti, we expanded our evaluation to include collection of a blood sample for viral screening (including viral cultures) from case patients. Our goal was to diagnose and characterize the clinical and epidemiological features of AFI in these children, to understand temporal patterns of infection and explore differences in clinical presentation.",

The staff at the school clinic initially assumed that the October-November AFI peaks reflected recurrence of CHIKV. However, at laboratory analysis we identified a cluster of DENV1 cases, followed by a small ZIKV cluster in December [14] . However, we were not able to find an cause for the majority of AFI cases in this time period, despite the use of viral culture techniques; work on identification of other possible etiologic agents for AFI cases in this time period continues. Finally, the January 2015 peak seems to have been due largely to an outbreak of DENV4 infection. Study population demographics, including age, sex, school location, and grade are presented in Table 1 , along with demographic-specific ARs for AFI.

In 2004, there was a reemergence of the virus, initially in Kenya, with a series of subsequent epidemics in and around the Indian Ocean. In December 2013, CHIKV infections were confirmed for the first time in the western hemisphere [4, 25] . It is clear from our study, and other longitudinal studies [7, 26] , that as the epidemic moved through islands and countries it was the dominant cause of AFI for a period of 2-4 months. However, in both longitudinal and cross-sectional studies [7, 26, 27] , what also emerges is a more complex picture of a m\u00e9lange of arboviral infections, with frequent coinfections and cases and case clusters attributable to other viruses surrounding the CHIKV epidemic peak. In Haiti, in contrast to other studies that relied on serologic assays, we performed actual viral cultures on a majority of case patients; findings further underscored the extent of coinfections [19] , and resulted in the identification of \"unexpected\" viruses, such as ZIKV and MAYV. It remains to be seen what impact this mix of infections has on host susceptibility and disease occurrence and severity [28, 29] .",

The current study made use of a school cohort, and consequently ages were concentrated between 3 years and 20 years, reflecting attendance in prekindergarten through \"grade 13\" (an additional year of school generally taken as part of the secondary education cycle). As noted above, our clinical staff was convinced that the AFI peak seen in October and November 2014 ( Figure 2 ) reflected a \"recurrence\" of CHIKV; in actuality, it built on a DENV1 case cluster, with some ZIKV mixed in at the end, and a still unidentified presumptive pathogen responsible for the majority of cases. Although we recognize the difficulties inherent in making clinical arboviral diagnoses, our data reinforce the frequency with which arthralgias are seen in CHIKV cases (with knees, wrists, and ankles most commonly affected, in keeping with findings in studies in other locales [9, 30] ).",

Obviously, the PPV will drop with low-level endemicity, compared with epidemic CHIKV; nonetheless, arthralgias seem to be useful markers for initial recognition of a possible CHIKV outbreak and targeting of the diagnostic workup.",

Samples were collected through a syndromic surveillance program whereby children who presented to the school clinic with a history of fever and/or had a fever at the time of the clinic visit (but no other localizing signs or symptoms) had blood collected and tested for viral infections. Given that viremia is relatively transient in some of these infections, it is possible that children with a history of fever, but no fever when seen in the clinic, were past the period of viremia, resulting in an underestimation of actual case numbers. Different rates of asymptomatic and subclinical infection for the various pathogens may also have resulted in differential case detection, potentially biasing our results.",

For example, because of the link between CHIKV infection and arthralgias, patients with CHIKV may have been more likely to seek medical care [33] . In addition, the clinical symptom data used in this analysis were not collected in a questionnaire format. Rather, symptom presence or absence was elicited from patients on presentation to the clinic as part of a routine medical history. Thus, it is possible that less severe (or perceived less severe) symptoms were not reported by the patient and thus incorrectly marked as \"absent\" in the medical records. Despite these limitations, our data provide a unique picture of the shifting causes of AFI in Haiti, and they highlight the apparent endemicity of a number of arboviral species. Interesting questions regarding viral origins are also raised by our identification of a cluster of ZIKV/CHIKV dual infections in May and June of 2014, at the very beginning of what subsequently became the ZIKV epidemic; as previously reported by our group, CHIKV and ZIKV strains from coinfected patients clustered monophyletically in their respective phylogeny, with molecular clock analysis suggesting that the 2 clades were introduced into the local population within overlapping time frames [19] .",

Clearly, ongoing surveillance is essential within this setting, both to monitor occurrence and transmission pathways of known pathogens, such as CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV, and MAYV, and to identify new and emergent viruses and viral clades, which may, in turn, form the basis for future epidemics.",
