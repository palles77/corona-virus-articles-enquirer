The relatively small, 123 amino acid, N protein of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), an arterivirus, presents an ideal model system for investigating the properties and mechanism of N protein nucleolar localization. The PRRSV N protein is found in both cytoplasmic and nucleolar compartments during infection and after transfection of gene constructs that express N-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fusion proteins. Experiments using oligopeptides, truncated polypeptides and amino acid-substituted proteins have identified several domains within PRRSV N protein that participate in nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling, including a cryptic nuclear localization signal (NLS) called NLS-1, a functional NLS (NLS-2), a nucleolar localization sequence (NoLS), as well as a possible nuclear export signal (NES). The purpose of this paper is to review our current understanding of PRRSV N protein shuttling and propose a shuttling scheme regulated by RNA binding and post-translational modification. #",

However, to date only N proteins from a few genera have been studied to the extent of identifying potential localization domains and interactions with nuclear/ nucleolar processes or proteins. The N protein of Semliki Forest virus (SFV), a flavivirus, contains two nucleolar localization sequences (NoLS; Favre et al., 1994) . Localization is implicated in the modulation of translation by either facilitating or blocking ribosome assembly in the nucleolus (Elgizoli et al., 1989) . The p21 form of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) N protein is translocated into the nucleus (Yasui et al., 1998) where it participates in the cytopathogenesis of HCV infection, perhaps by blocking nuclear import and export of host cell proteins/mRNAs (Isoyama et al., 2002) or by facilitating cell transformation (Yamanaka et al., 2002) .",

PRRSV N protein is distributed between nucleolar and cytoplasmic compartments in cultured macrophages and MARC-145 cells infected with North American and European PRRSV genotypes. A similar pattern of cytoplasmic/nucleolar localization has been reported for several members of the coronavirus family, including the group III coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the group I coronavirus, transmissible gastro-enteritis virus (TGEV), and the group II coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV; Hiscox et al., 2001; Wurm et al., 2001) . More recently, Tijms et al. (2002) reported the nucleolar localization of the N protein from equine arteritis virus (EAV), another member of the arterivirus group. PRRSV, coronavirus and EAV N proteins when expressed alone or fused to the red-shifted enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) localize to the nucleolus demonstrating that translocation across the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and accumulation in the nucleolus are independent of other viral proteins (Rowland et al., 1999; Hiscox et al., 2001; Wurm et al., 2001) .",

The N proteins of VR-2332 and Lelystad viruses do not possess a cleavable signal peptide and are maintained as mature 123 and 128 amino acid proteins, respectively (Mardassi et al., 1996) . The N protein is the most abundant viral protein in virus-infected cells and constitutes as much as 40% of the protein content of the virion (Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998) . A summary of the structural and functional domains within the N protein is illustrated in Fig. 1 . Both covalent and noncovalent bonds participate in the formation of homodimers, Ns and other higher ordered structures. Covalent interactions are formed through disulfide linkages between conserved cysteines at position 23 in North American strains and position 27 in European isolates. More recently, one of us reported that non-covalent interactions, involving residues 31 \u00c1/37, also contribute to N protein polymerization (Wootton and Yoo, 2003) . The reason for both soft (non-covalent) and hard (covalent) docking interactions between N proteins is not clear, but suggests that different types of interactions may be involved in determining how N functions in its structural and non-structural capacities.",

Accordingly, numerous panels of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been generated for which major epitopes lie predominantly in the central region of the protein (Rodriguez et al., 1997; Wootton et al., 1998) in an area of high surface probability. Even though the North American and European PRRSV N proteins are only about 63% identical at the amino acid level, mAb binding studies show a common antigenic region between amino acids 52 and 69, located within a possible loop domain (Rodriguez et al., 1997; Meulenberg et al., 1998; Wootton et al., 1998) . Recognition by several mAbs is lost after single amino acid substitutions within the last 11 amino acids, indicating a change in the overall conformation of the protein. Therefore, we have termed this region the conformation-determining region (Wootton et al., 1998) . As discussed later, anti-N mAbs have proved useful for probing conformational changes that result from mutations that produce a change in N protein localization.",

The ''pat4'' NLS consists of a continuous stretch of four basic amino acids (lysine or arginine) or three basic amino acids associated with histidine or proline. The ''pat7'' NLS starts with a proline and is followed within three residues by an amino acid sequence containing three basic residues out of four. The third type of NLS, known as a ''bipartite'' motif, consists of two basic amino acids, a 10 amino acid spacer and a five amino acid sequence containing at least three basic residues. This information has been incorporated into computer programs that identify NLS motifs (Nakai and Kanehisa, 1992) , but cannot always successfully predict the localization of a protein to the nucleus (Silver, 1991; Hicks and Raikhel, 1995) . Proteins without an NLS can be co-transported with other nuclear proteins and proteins that contain NLS sequences may remain cytoplasmic, especially if NLS sequence is blocked or buried within the protein (Roberts et al., 1987) .

PSORT analysis of the North American PRRSV isolate, SDSU-23983, identified a pat4 domain at position 10 called NLS-1 and a pat7 motif at position 41 called NLS-2 (Figs. 1 and 2). Furthermore, a Hopp \u00c1/Woods hydrophilicity analysis (Hopp and Woods, 1981 ) of the peptide sequence, shown in Fig. 2 , predicts that both NLSs are in hydrophilic regions and should be easily accessible.

            "text": "The second step in the analysis was to determine if each putative NLS could localize a protein tag to the nucleus. For the purpose of these experiments, we chose the autofluorescent EGFP as a tag for N oligopeptides. EGFP by itself, because of its relatively small size (approximately 25 kDa) and neutral properties, maintains a localization pattern consistent with passive diffusion. Therefore, EGFP is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm, but is excluded from the nucleolus and some cytoplasmic compartments (see Fig.  3a ; Rowland et al., 1999) . The diffusion of EGFP throughout the cell offers a special advantage, by allowing the study of the localization properties of import or export signal sequences or their combined function. When EGFP is fused to the N protein, as shown in Fig. 3b , the distribution of EGFP tag changes, with a large accumulation of N in the nucleolus and disappearance from the nucleoplasm. Cytoplasmic localization is largely unaffected except for an increased accumulation of N-EGFP in the perinuclear region. N protein gene fragments containing NLS-1 (amino acids 1 \u00c1/14) or NLS-2 (amino acids 39 \u00c1/48) were ligated in front of EGFP and the fusion gene placed under control of a CMV promoter. Both peptides were able to accumulate EGFP in the nucleus as well as the nucleolus, indicating that NLS-1 and NLS-2 can function as NLS sequences, sufficient to localize EGFP to the nucleus ( Fig. 3c and d) . However, these data provided no information on which NLS or if both participate in N protein translocation to the nucleus. Therefore, the third step in the analysis was to study the localization of N proteins that contained mutations in each or both of the localization domains. In summary (see Rowland et al., in press) , the substitution of lysines for glycines at positions 10 and 11, which changed the pat4 NLS-1 sequence from 10-KRKK to 10-GGKK in the construct EGFP-N (1 \u00c1/123, G10, G11), did not alter N-EGFP localization. Even the complete elimination of NLS-1 by removing the first 14 residues from the Nterminus (construct EGFP-N (14 \u00c1/123)) produced a localization pattern similar to wild-type N. To eliminate NLS-2, we substituted lysines 43 and 44 with glycine residues, changing the NLS-2 sequence from 41-PGKKNKK to 41-PGGGNKK. The resulting construct, EGFP-N (1 \u00c1/123, G43, G44), remained in the cytoplasm and was completely excluded from the nucleus/nucleolus. These results suggested that lysines 43 and 44 formed part of a functional NLS sufficient for the translocation of N into the nucleus. However, we recognized that the elimination of lysines in NLS-2 could produce a conformational change in the N protein, which might cause refolding and loss of NLS accessibility. We took advantage of an array of six anti-N mAbs to identify possible changes in N protein conformation. The mAbs used were SDOW-17, SR-30, VO-17, JP-24, EP-47 and MR-40 (Nelson et al., 1993; Wootton et al., 1998 Wootton et al., , 2001 . All antibodies reacted with the full-length N-EGFP fusion protein indicating that EGFP did affect N protein conformation. Furthermore, the same panel reacted with both NLS-1-and NLS-2minus mutant proteins. From these data, we concluded that NLS-2 is the signal sequence involved in the transport of N into the nucleus.",

A comparison with known viral NoLS sequences shows little sequence homology between N and other viral NoLS sequences, except for the incorporation of an NLS (see Fig. 5 ).

Slides were fixed in 100% acetone and photomicrographs taken at high power on a fluorescence microscope. An NLS-minus, NES-minus ERev protein, called DDRev represented by a hatched bars, was used as an irrelevant peptide to stabilize EGFP during acetone fixation. Arrows identify the location of the nucleus in each cell. The dark spots within the nucleus of (a) and bright spots in the nucleus of (b) are the nucleoli.",

For instance, nucleolar proteins, such as nucleolin, fribrillarin and B-23, are found distributed between nucleolar and cytoplasmic compartments, a pattern of distribution resembling the N protein. Nucleolin is the most abundant protein in the nucleoli of rapidly dividing cells. The molecular basis for nucleolin's participation in nucleolar biogenesis and other proliferation-related functions can be localized to one of three domains. The N-terminal one-third is enriched in acidic residues, which participate in the reorganization of the rDNA chromatin regions (Srivastava and Pollard, 1999) and can interact with stretches of basic amino acids in NoLS sequences, thus facilitating the transport of proteins from the cytoplasm to the nucleolus (Chen et al., 2002) . B-23 is also enriched in acidic amino acid residues. The NoLS in the HTLV-1 Rex protein can interact with B-23, which acts as shuttle protein with the capacity to transport Rex from the cytoplasm to the nucleolus (Adachi et al., 1993) . A similar mechanism of nucleolar transport has been described for HIV Tat protein (Liu et al., 1997) .",

NES sequences are relatively short linear oligopeptides, but unlike NLS and NoLS domains they are enriched in leucine residues. The classical NES is composed of the peptide sequence X-R (2 \u00c1 4) -X-R 2 -X-R-X, where X is leucine, isoleucine or valine and R any amino acid (Hope, 1999; Henderson and Eleftheriou, 2000) . Atypical NES sequences are defined as CRM1-dependent, but do not contain the classical NES motif. Examples include EIAV and FIV Rev proteins (Otero et al., 1998) . In addition to CRM1-dependent export, CRM1-independent nuclear export has been identified in variety of viral proteins, including human adenovirus E1B-55K, CMV pUL69 and HSV-1 ICP27 (Dosch et al., 2001; Lischka et al., 2001; Soliman and Silverstein, 2000) . PRRSV N protein contains two regions, which are sufficiently enriched in hydrophobic amino acids to function as NES motifs. The first hydrophobic region is located between amino acids 19 and 30, but does not contain an LXL motif. The second hydrophobic region, which contains at least one LXL motif (see Fig. 2 ), is located between amino acids 106 and 117. The same sequence is found in the European Lelystad N protein.

In previous work, we reported as few as 20% of PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells that contained detectable quantities of N in the nucleoli (Rowland et al., 1999) . Furthermore, the percentage of PRRSV-infected cells with N in the nucleolus is further dependent on when observations are made during the course of infection. In contrast to these results, Tijms et al. (2002) reported that EAV N protein localized to all nucleoli when cells were treated with leptomycin B (LMB), an inhibitor of CRM1dependent export. In our studies, typically 50 \u00c1/70% of transfected cells localize N-EGFP protein to the nucleolus. These observations suggested to us that arterivirus and coronavirus N proteins localize to the nucleolus of all cells; however, the absence of detectable amounts of N in the nucleolus may be the result of regulation, e.g. enhanced nuclear export of N relative to import in some cells. Tartakoff et al. (2000) described several schemes for the shuttling of proteins between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Viral proteins, such as HIV Rev, which contains single NLS and NES domains, continuously shuttle back and forth between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, an efficient mechanism for recycling Rev function. This type of nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling scheme is described as [C\u00c1/N\u00c1/C] n (abbreviated CNC-N), where C and N represent cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, respectively, and the subscript n indicates an unlimited number of trips between the C and N compartments (see illustration presented in Fig. 7) . In contrast, ribosomal proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm, transported through NPC into the nucleolus, where they are combined with rRNA and assembled into ribosomal subunits, then transported back to the cytoplasm, making only a single trip through the nucleus/nucleolus. This type of shuttling scheme is described as [C \u00c1/N\u00c1/C] 1 (the subscript 1 indicates a single trip from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and then back to the cytoplasm, and for the purpose of this review it is abbreviated as CNC-1).",

            "text": "The two types of shuttling can be distinguished based on the ability of LMB and cyclohexamide (CHX) to interrupt localization during the steady-state expression of EGFP-tagged proteins. LMB is a specific inhibitor of nuclear export and functions by covalently binding to the exportin shuttle protein, CRM1, thus preventing the formation of the cargo protein \u00c1/CRM1 export complex (Fornerod et al., 1997) . In the absence of both drugs, CNC-N and CNC-1 proteins are distributed between both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, a product of the rates of nuclear import versus export. In cells that express equine infectious anemia virus Rev protein linked to EGFP (ERev-EGFP) or N-EGFP, this steady-state equilibrium is represented by cells that contain EGFP-labeled protein in both cytoplasmic and nuclear/nucleolar compartments ( Fig. 8a and e) . However, in any given cell, this distribution may be skewed towards the preferential accumulation of EGFP-labeled protein in the nucleus or the cytoplasm. In the presence of LMB, CNC-N proteins preferentially accumulate in the nucleus, a result of the loss of export function (Fig.  8b) . Since the shuttling of CNC-N proteins is not dependent on ongoing protein synthesis (see Fig. 7 ), CHX does not affect the distribution of ERev-EGFP in the presence or absence of LMB (Fig. 8) . In contrast, the addition of CHX to CNC-1 proteins leads to the eventual disappearance of protein from the nucleus, because only newly synthesized proteins are imported into the nucleus, then exported and not allowed to reenter the nuclear compartment. In the presence of CHX, the amount of N-EGFP in the nucleolus is greatly reduced in all cells (Fig. 8 , compare e with g). However, the addition of LMB restores nucleolar localization by preventing the exit of proteins already present in the nucleus (Fig. 8h) .",

The cyclic nature of this trafficking scheme means that the steady-state distribution is largely independent of de novo protein synthesis and not affected by protein synthesis inhibitors such as CHX. However, LMB, an inhibitor of CRM1, blocks export, which leads to the eventual accumulation of protein in the nucleus. The lower figure shows the trafficking scheme typical of CNC-1 proteins which are transported to the nucleus and then returned to the cytoplasm, cycling through the nucleus only once. The steady-state distribution of CNC-1 proteins is dependent on de novo protein synthesis; therefore, in the presence of CHX, protein will disappear from the nucleus. In the presence of LMB, protein export is blocked. LMB does not affect the distribution of protein molecules retained in the cytoplasm.",

Phosphorylation can also enhance nuclear transport, by inducing conformational changes, that increases the accessibility of NLS (Jans and Hubner, 1996; Xiao et al., 1998) . The role that phosphorylation plays in cytoplasmic-nucleolar shuttling of N is unknown. Our most recent data indicate that both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated N is found in both the cytoplasm and the nucleolus.

However, the addition of 20 mg/ml actino-mycin D to cells expressing N-EGFP produces the opposite effect, i.e. the accumulation of PRRSV N protein in the nucleus (data not shown), which suggests that RNA binding may regulate both N protein assembly (Wootton and Yoo, 2003) as well as localization.

            "text": "Even though the structure and function of coronavirus and arterivirus N proteins have been the subject of intense study for several years, the localization of the N protein to the nucleus/nucleolus has come to light very recently (Rowland et al., 1999; Wurm et al., 2001) . The function of N protein in the nucleolus presents at least three possibilities. First, lysine/arginine-rich RNA binding domains can mimic nuclear and nucleolar localization signal sequences (LaCasse and Lefebvre, 1995). Overproduction of N protein combined with a mechanism for export from the nucleus would ensure that sufficient quantities of N protein would be available for incorporation into Ns. A second and closely related possibility is that nucleolar accumulation of N is a host cell defense strategy designed to inhibit viral assembly. Since PRRSV assembles viral proteins in the ER \u00c1/Golgi compartment, the diversion of large quantities of N protein to the nucleolus would deprive the replicating virus of an essential structural protein. As a counterstrategy, the virus would either overproduce N or incorporate an NES to return N to the cytoplasm. And finally, a third possibility is that nucleolar localiza- Fig. 8 . The effect of LMB and CHX on the localization of ERev-EGFP and N-EGFP proteins. MARC-145 cells were transfected with ERev-or N-EGFP fusion constructs. After 15 h, CHX and LMB were added at concentrations of 50 mg/ml and 100 ng/ml, respectively, and slides incubated for an additional 8 h. Cells were fixed in acetone prior to visualization. Arrows identify the location of the nuclei. tion of N participates in the modulation of nucleolar function, a strategy designed to optimize virus replication. Besides its function in rRNA synthesis and ribosome assembly, the nucleolus participates in the regulation of several host cell processes, including regulation of the cell cycle, apoptosis and the induction of antiviral responses. Therefore, the effect of N on nucleolar function would be through interactions with nucleolar proteins, rRNA or rDNA. Chen et al. (2002) showed that a coronavirus N protein was involved in the redistribution of the nucleolar protein, fibrillarin, and was able to form an interaction with another nucleolar protein, nucleolin. The eventual effect of N protein expression was the inhibition of cell division. Decreased proliferation would benefit the virus by diverting biosynthetic resources from the dividing nucleus to the cytoplasm, the site of coronavirus replication. Presumably, the inhibition of cell proliferation is occurring by the direct interaction of N protein with fibrillarin, nucleolin and other nucleolar proteins. It remains to be seen if the N protein of PRRSV behaves in a similar manner.",
