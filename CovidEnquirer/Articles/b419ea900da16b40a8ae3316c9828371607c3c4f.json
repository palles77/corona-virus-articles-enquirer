Design: an exploratory descriptive correlation design. Data were collected on three occasions: during latent phase of labour, during active phase of labour and within 24-48 hrs after delivery. Setting: an obstetric unit of a public teaching hospital in Hong Kong. Participants: a convenience sample of 90 Hong Kong Chinese first-time mothers. Measurements and findings: the Labour Agentry Scale (LAS) is a self-report scale designed to measure feelings of control during childbirth. A Visual Analogue Scale for anxiety (VAS-A) was used to measure women's self-reported level of anxiety during labour. Pearson Product Moment Correlation coefficient test indicated a significant negative relationship between the feelings of control and maternal anxiety during labour. No statistical relationships were detected between women's attendance at antenatal classes and feelings of control during labour. Key conclusions: the study showed a significant negative relationship between maternal anxiety and feelings of control during labour. Implications for practice: midwives should work with women to enhance their personal control during labour and satisfaction with their birth. The insignificant relationship between attendance at antenatal classes and feelings of control suggests the need to evaluate the content of childbirth education in order to empower women's control during labour.",

In the past decade, growing recognition of the importance of woman-centred maternity care has shifted the emphasis of the importance of care to promote pregnant women's psychosocial health (Lavender et al., 1999) . Recent studies have suggested that feelings of control during labour are one of the important factors contributing to maternal childbirth satisfaction (Gibbins and Thomson, 2001) , and women should be empowered through knowledge of what to expect from accurate information received about the birth process. As studies exploring the concept of feelings of control during labour and the relationship with maternal physical and psychological labour outcomes are limited, the present study was undertaken to look at these issues in more detail.",

However, the effectiveness of these methods remain inconclusive. Lowe (1996) has explained that how women express, manage and cope with labour discomfort is individual and dependent on a variety of factors. Recently, Gibbins and Thomson (2001) pointed out that maternal feelings of control during labour could be the most vital predictor of an enjoyable birth, and may help in decreasing the level of anxiety during pregnancy.",

They defined feelings of control as the sense of mastery over internal and environmental forces by personal initiation of choice that was self-actualising, active, responsible, creative and controlling one's own density. Recently, Green and Baston (2003) categorised the senses of control into three dimensions: control of what health-care professionals are doing, control of one's own behaviour and control during a contraction. It seems that this categorisation of control provides a more specific and measurable way for women and caregivers to evaluate control during labour.",

However, women had significantly higher Labour Agentry Scale (LAS) scores when they experienced continuous caregiver support (Hodnett and Osborn, 1989) , spontaneous birth without continuous fetal heart monitoring (Hodnett, 1982) and decreased usage of pharmacological pain-relief measures (Hodnett and Abel, 1986) .

Woollett and Dosanjh (1995) indicated that Chinese women who lived in East London perceived personal involvement in decision-making as very helpful, and were more committed to seeking childbirth information than non-Asian women. In investigating the difference in choice and control as experienced by Chinese and Scottish childbearing women in Scotland, Cheung (2002) found that Chinese women preferred to give birth without medical intervention and to be well informed during labour. In contrast, a recent study (Ip et al., 2003) revealed that Chinese pregnant women had a strong expectation about the level of social support that should be provided by their nurses and partners during labour; however, their expectations of their own responsibilities towards how they coped with childbirth were relatively low.",

As a precautionary measure, no visitor was allowed to enter the hospital. The dominant model of care in the unit was medical and supported the active management of labour. This meant that most women had their labour induced or augmented; all women in labour abstained from food and drink, and received continuous electronic fetal monitoring. In addition, each woman was required to have 4-hourly and 2-hourly vaginal examinations, respectively, during the latent and active phases of their labour. The use of continuous fetal monitoring restricted women to a lateral position on the labour ward bed, and to give birth in the lithotomy position. Moreover, episiotomy was routinely carried out for every primigravida. Women at low risk were classified as a midwifery case according to the hospital protocol; this meant that women in labour were cared for by midwives without the involvement of an obstetrician unless a complication was detected. One midwife usually took care of more than one woman in labour at any given time. About 2 hrs after giving birth, women were transferred to a postnatal ward where a new team of midwives took care of them and their babies.",

Possible total scores for the LAS range from 29 (indicating feelings of control rarely) to 203 (reflecting feelings of control almost always). The reported internal consistency of the LAS ranges from 0.91 to 0.98 (Hodnett and Abel, 1986) . Hodnett and Simmons-Tropea (1987) claimed that LAS scores remained stable at 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months postpartum. In the present study, the Chinese version of LAS (c-LAS) was used, which has demonstrated high internal consistency with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.87, comparable to the previous findings reported by Law (2003) .",

This may affect the accuracy of the recalled information. Moreover, the VAS is used as the selfreport tool and may overestimate or underestimate the anxiety experienced by the women during labour. A replicated study of anxiety and feelings of control with a larger sample size is recommended.",

            "text": "As expected, the retrospective measure of the overall anxiety level during labour correlated highly with the measures taken at the time of labour. The insignificant differences between the recalled overall anxiety scores and anxiety scores during the active phase of labour may shed some light on the use of retrospective measures in studies that have difficulties in gaining access to the labour ward. Some previous investigators (Simkin, 1992; McCrea and Wright, 1999) have argued that the recall of labour experience might be subject to the 'halo' effect, as this was a recall of negative aspects of childbirth. Notwithstanding, Redelmeier and Kahneman (1996) suggested that it was impossible to retain every aspect of pain episode in memory, and the retention of a memory of pain at its worst may be maximally efficient. This theoretical explanation could be extended to recall anxiety level, and, as such, the postnatal assessed anxiety could represent a measure of anxiety at its most intense. More studies about anxiety of diverse cause are necessary before one can conclude that postnatally assessed anxiety does represent a measure of anxiety at its most intense. Hodnett and Abel (1986) concluded that the mean LAS scores of homebirth primigravida (160.81, SD \u00bc 20.29) were higher than those who gave birth in hospitals (142.89, SD \u00bc 22.01). The mean c-LAS score reported by the Chinese primigravida in the current study was 131.47 (SD \u00bc 22.94), which is comparatively lower than the mean LAS scores reported in Hodnett and Abel's (1986) study. This suggests that the environment of birth might affect the woman's feelings of control. Women who had a home birth indicated that they anticipated greater control over decision-making, greater commitment to non-medicalised childbirth, more freedom of mobility and avoidance of intrusive medical procedures (Hodnett and Abel, 1986 ). In addition, Hodnett and Abel (1986) reported that those women who gave birth in hospitals were allowed to ambulate until delivery. In contrast, the Hong Kong Chinese women were confined to bed and positioned laterally, with continuous fetal heart monitoring throughout their entire labour.",

            "text": "In this study, one caregiver usually took care of more than one woman during labour at any given time. Besides environmental influences, the support of the caregiver is vital to the feelings of control in the women during labour. This was reinforced by Hodnett and Osborn (1989) who studied labouring women receiving continuous one-to-one caregiver support during labour. Hodnett and Osborn (1989) reported higher LAS mean score (151.3 SD \u00bc 26.4) than the Chinese women during labour in the current study. This suggested that there would have been room for improvement in the current midwifery practice in Hong Kong, with the objectives for balancing economic constraints while providing quality care. Heavy reliance on a technological and medicalised approach to birth at the study unit may reflect that the administrative health policies do not value or understand the time intensiveness of being with women, and this may influence women's satisfaction and their postnatal health and well-being. Midwives are encouraged to initiate dialogue with obstetricians to look for ways of improving women's birth environment. Waldenstrom et al. (1996) emphasised that the sense of control during childbirth came from the opportunity to receive support from significant others or caregivers. Gibbins and Thomson (2001) added that the perceived partner's support during labour was identified by the women during labour as a crucial factor in helping them maintain control and cope with the challenge of labour. As the current study was conducted during the SARS endemic in Hong Kong, when husbands were not permitted to accompany labour, the influence of husband's support on women's sense of control could not be explored. It would be worthwhile replicating the study with the husbands present during labour in future.",

On the other hand, Scottish women were more concerned about what had happened and what was done to them (Cheung, 2002) The findings suggested a negative relationship between the feelings of control and maternal anxiety. In other words, women in labour who perceived better personal control over the labour process reported a reduction in the level of anxiety. This is echoed by Mineka and Kelly (1989) who reported that the person that preferred to take control found it effective in lowering anticipatory anxiety as well as reducing the effect of aversive events.",
