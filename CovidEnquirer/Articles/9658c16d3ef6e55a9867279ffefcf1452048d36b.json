The cases of only one varying parameter, two varying parameters and three varying parameters are considered to analyze the dynamical behaviors of the system. For the case of one varying parameter, the periodic, chaotic and hyperchaotic dynamical behaviors are investigated via the bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponent spectrum diagram and Poincare section. For the cases of two and three varying parameters, a Lyapunov diagram is applied. A tracking controller is designed to eliminate the hyperchaotic dynamical behavior of the system, such that the disease gradually disappears. In particular, the stability and bifurcation of the system for the case which is the degree of seasonality \u03b2 1 = 0 are considered. Then taking isolation control, the aim of elimination of the disease can be reached. Finally, numerical simulations are given to illustrate the validity of the proposed results.",

            "text": "Mathematical models describing the population dynamics of infectious diseases have been playing an important role in a better understanding of epidemiological patterns and disease control for a long time. In order to predict the spread of infectious disease among regions, many epidemic models have been proposed and analyzed in recent years (see [1] [2] [3] [4] ). However, most of the literature researched on epidemic systems (see [5] [6] [7] [8] ) assumes that the disease incubation is negligible which causes that, once infected, each susceptible individual (in class S) becomes infectious instantaneously (in class I) and later recovers (in class R) with a permanent or temporary acquired immunity. The model based on these assumptions is customarily called an SIR (susceptible-infectious-recovered) or SIRS (susceptible-infectious-recovered-susceptible) system (see [9, 10] ). Many diseases such as measles, severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) and so on, however, incubate inside the hosts for a period of time before the hosts become infectious. So the systems that are more general than SIR or SIRS types need to be studied to investigate the role of incubation in disease transmission. We may assume that a susceptible individual first goes through a latent period (and said to become exposed or in the class E) after infection before becoming infectious. Thus the resulting models are of SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) or SEIRS (susceptible-exposedinfectious-recovered-susceptible) types, respectively, depending on whether the acquired immunity is permanent or not. Many researchers have studied the stability, bifurcation or chaos behavior of SEIR or SEIRS epidemic systems (see [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] ). Michael et al. [11] study the global stability of an SEIR epidemic system in the interior of the feasible region. Greenhalgh [17] discusses Hopf bifurcation in models of SEIRS type with density dependent contact and death rates. In addition, some literature on the SEIR-type age-independent epidemic systems has been investigated by many authors (see [15, 17, 18] ) and their threshold theorems are well obtained.",

Although many epidemic systems can be described by differential and algebraic equations (see [2, 13, 16, 23] ), they are studied by reducing the dimension of epidemic models to differential systems and the dynamical behaviors of the whole systems are not better described. By reducing the dimension of an SEIR epidemic system via substituted algebraic constraint into differential equations and using the methods of reconstructed phase and correlation dimension, Olsen and Schaffer [13] studied the system described by differential equations that is chaos with a degree of seasonality \u03b2 1 = 0.28.",

The literature mentioned above is concerned about low-dimensional chaotic systems with one positive Lyapunov exponent. The attractor of chaotic systems that may have two or more positive Lyapunov exponents is called hyperchaos. However, many researchers have investigated hyperchaotic systems which are the classical hyperchaotic systems, such as hyperchaotic Chen systems, hyperchaotic Rossler systems, hyperchaotic Lorenz systems and so on (see [28] [29] [30] [31] ). They are all based on hyperchaos synchronization and hyperchaos control. Up to now, a wide variety of approaches have been used to control hyperchaotic systems, for example, the sliding mode control, state feedback control, adaptive control and tracking control, etc. (see [32] [33] [34] [35] ). However, no literature discusses hyperchaos and its control based on differential and algebraic systems.",

The contribution of this paper can be divided into three main parts. In the first part, an SEIR epidemic system with seasonal forcing in transmission rate, which is a new form of differential and algebraic system, is modeled. We discuss the cases of only one varying parameter, two varying parameters and three varying parameters, respectively. For the case of one varying parameter, the periodic, chaotic and hyperchaotic dynamical behaviors of the system are analyzed via the bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponent spectrum diagram and Poincare section. For the cases of two and three varying parameters, the dynamical behaviors of the system are investigated by using Lyapunov diagrams. In the second part, for the hyperchaotic dynamical behavior of the system, we design a tracking controller such that the infectious trajectory of the system tracks an ideal state i d (t) = 0. In the last part, the case for the degree of seasonality \u03b2 1 = 0 is studied. Taking isolation control, we reach the aim of elimination of the disease, and it is easy to implement in real life. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, some preliminaries for the differential and algebraic systems are introduced and the SEIR model is described by differential and algebraic equations. In Section 3, the dynamical behaviors of the model are analyzed and a tracking controller is designed for the hyperchaotic system, such that the infected gradually disappears. In particular, the case for the degree of seasonality \u03b2 1 = 0 is studied. Taking isolation control, the aim of elimination of the disease can be reached. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the validity of the controller. Some concluding remarks are given in Section 4.",

These dynamical behaviors are generally deleterious for biologic systems, and often lead to a disease spreading gradually or breaking out suddenly in certain regions. In other words, many people in the region would be infected by disease and some of them could even lose their lives. Therefore, it is important to effectively control bifurcation or chaotic dynamical behavior of epidemic models. In this paper, we study an SEIR epidemic model which is a differential and algebraic system with seasonal forcing in transmission rate. We consider three cases: only one varying parameter, two varying parameters and three varying parameters. For the case of only one varying parameter, we analyze the dynamics of the system by using the bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponent spectrum diagram and Poincare section. For the cases of two and three varying parameters, a Lapunov diagram is applied in the analysis of dynamical behaviors. Furthermore, for the hyperchaotic dynamical behavior of the system, we design a tracking controller such that the disease gradually disappears. In particular, we discuss the stability and the transcritical bifurcation for the degree of seasonality \u03b2 1 = 0. The disease is eliminated by taking isolation control which is an effective measure. Finally, numerical simulations are given to illuminate the proposed control methods.",
