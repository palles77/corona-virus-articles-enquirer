The highest safe concentrations against vero cells from curcumin was 6.25 ppm and 1.5625 ppm for PGV-0. Immunocytochemistry test of curcumin and PGV-0 in both incubation period (one and three days) shows no significant difference (significant value 0.925), but RT-PCR result indicates that PGV -0 have potential antiviral better than curcumin.",

Dengue is still a significant health problem in tropical and sub tropical countries, because the course of this disease was very fast, so if not addressed promptly, it can be fatal. The global prevalence of dengue infection has increased dramatically in recent decades. Dengue infection has now become an endemic in more than 112 countries in Africa, America, Eastern Mediterranean, Southeast Asia and Western Pacific. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 40% of the world's population or 2.5 billion people live in tropical and subtropical areas at risk for contracting the Dengue infection [1, 2] .",

Mean while incubation of Dengue-2 virus infection treated with PGV-0 in third days was negative. This suggested that the PGV-0 have a Dengue-2 antiviral better than curcumin. This was possible because there was a major difference between curcumin and PGV-0 on the central cluster chemical structure. Removal of the active methylene group and the carbonyl group at the center of the structure of curcumin led to be non-polar, so it became more soluble in lipid and was more easily interact with the walls of bacteria and viruses. So that from this research the PGV-0 is more potent than curcumin as Dengue antivirus.",
