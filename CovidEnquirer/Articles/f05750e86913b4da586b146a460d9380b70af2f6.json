            "text": "The sialylation pattern of serum a1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) in non-symptomatic cats infected by feline coronavirus (FCoV) and its possible relationship with the amount of FCoVs shed in faeces were investigated. Blood from three specific pathogen-free cats (group A) and from 10 non-symptomatic FCoV-positive cats from catteries with low (group B, three cats) or high (group C, seven cats) levels of faecal shedding were collected monthly. AGP was purified from serum and Western blotting followed by lectin-staining of a(2,3)-linked and a(2,6)-linked sialic acid. Faecal shedding was quantified in group C by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Variations of AGP sialylation were recorded only in cats from group C, on which viral shedding peaked before the occurrence of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) in the cattery, and decreased 1 month later, when serum AGP had an increase of a(2,3)-linked sialic acid. These results suggest that hypersialylation of AGP may be involved in hostevirus interactions. T he acute phase protein a1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) increases in several inflammatory and neoplastic conditions of cats (Paltrinieri in press). In cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), caused by feline coronavirus (FCoV), the increase of AGP is particularly evident (Duthie et al 1997 , Paltrinieri et al 2007a and AGP is hyposialylated (Ceciliani et al 2004) . In a previous study (Paltrinieri et al 2007b) we demonstrated that AGP increased before the appearance of FIP, even in FCoV-infected cats that remain non-symptomatic, suggesting that an inflammatory response is mounted, even in those cats that do not develop FIP. In the study cited above, faecally shed FCoVs were not quantified or sequenced, therefore, hampering the ability to assess whether the increased serum AGP levels was a consequence of the higher viral load of non-mutated FCoVs or a protective response against mutant strains. However, 1 month later, the percentage of shedders decreased, suggesting a direct association between these phenomena, possibly mediated by altered sialylation of circulating AGP. Quantifying the faecal shedding of FCoV and the degree of AGP sialylation would contribute to our understanding of the hoste FCoVs interactions.",

            "text": "For both the lectins (Table 1) , the results of SPF cats were closely distributed around the value of the pooled serum, while groups B and C showed a high individual variability. This variability, together with the low number of animals examined, was likely responsible for the lack of significant differences in spite of evident variations in mean values among sequential samplings. Nevertheless, in group C the sialic acid a(2,6)-linked to galactose tended to decrease at samplings 4 and 5, and significantly increased at samplings 6 and 7. The only difference between group C and other groups was the breed composition and the level of FCoV contamination. Breed-related differences of AGP sialylation are unlikely, based on the results of tests performed on cats of different breeds (data not included in this study). The difference recorded is, thus, likely depending on FCoV infection. Interestingly, in the previous study both the antibody titres and the concentration of AGP increased at sampling 5, 2 weeks before the occurrence of episodes of FIP in the cattery. The increased sialylation recorded here could thus be interpreted as a protective response against the virus, possibly mediated by an interaction between FCoVs and sialylated AGP. Moreover, hypersialylation elongates the half-life of circulating proteins (Gregoriadis et al 2005) which may partly explain why the concentration of serum AGP did not show, at sampling 7, the same increase recorded at sampling 5 (both these samplings were followed by outbreaks of FIP). In humans, AGP has immunomodulatory functions (Vasson et al 1994) and its degree of glycosylation influences susceptibility or resistance to viruses (Rabehi et al 1995) . Some species of coronavirus have a high affinity for sialylated molecules (Schwegmann-Wessels and Herrler 2006) , and, although the affinity of FCoVs for sialic acid has not yet been investigated, the results presented here stimulate future research on this topic.",
