Our study showed that codon usage bias of DEV UL21 had strong bias towards the A-ended or T-ended codons, and GC3s contents of the codon usage bias in DEV UL21 gene were significantly varied compared with those of other 27 reference herpesviruses. The CAI, ENC value of DEV CHv strain UL21 gene is 0.615 and 55.167, respectively, indicating that the codon usage bias of this gene is weak and lowly expressed. The plot of ENC versus GC3S content revealed that DEV UL21 gene is subject to GC compositional constraints. The phylogentic analysis about amino acids codon usage bias of DEV UL21 and the27 reference herpesviruses showed that DEV was evolutionarily closer to herpesviruses Mardivirus. In addition, the codon usage bias of DEV UL21 gene was compared with those of E. coli, yeast and humans. There are 42 45, 39 same codons usage bias between the DEV UL21 to E.coli, Yeast, H.sapiens, respectively, indicaiting that UL21 gene of DEV may be more efficiently expressed in the yeast system .",

            "text": "Previous studies have revealed that there was a strongly significant correlation between gene expression level and codon usage bias in Escherichia coli, yeast and Humans [40] . The synonymous codon usage patterns are related to the abundance of isoaccepting tRNAs [13, 14] , highly expressed genes have a strong selective preference for the codons complementary to the most abundant tRNA species, whereas lowly expressed genes display more uniform codon usage patterns largely compatible with the mutational bias in the absence of translational selection [41, 42] . Selecting relative abundance of isoaccepting tRNAs between the gene and expression system codon usage bias is more important for gene expression level. Table 3 shows there are 42, 45, 39 codons showing the DEV UL21 to E.coli, Yeast, H.sapiens ratio between 0.5 to 2.0 respectively, and the codon usage bias pattern in the DPV UL21 gene is similar to that of Yeast. We can conclude that the yeast expression system is more effective for expression of the UL21gene.",
