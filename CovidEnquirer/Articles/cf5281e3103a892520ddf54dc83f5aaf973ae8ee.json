In human medicine PEs are divided into only two categories: transudates and exudates. The aim of this study was to evaluate, in 20 cats presented with PE, paired samples of serum and pleural fluid for the following parameters: Light's criteria (pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase concentration (LDHp), pleural fluid/serum LDH ratio, pleural fluid/serum total protein ratio (TPr)), pleural fluid total protein, pleural fluid cholesterol concentration, pleural fluid/serum cholesterol ratio (CHOLr), serum-effusion cholesterol gradient (serum cholesterol minus PE cholesterol concentration (CHOLg)), PE total nucleated cells count (TNCCp) and pleural fluid glucose (GLUp). LDHp and TPr were found most reliable when distinguishing between transudates and exudates, with sensitivity of 100% and 91% and specificity of 100%, respectively. When conflict between the clinical picture and laboratory results exists, calculation of CHOLr, CHOLg and TNCCp measurement may help in the classification of the effusion. Measurement of serum albumin (in the case of a transudate) may provide additional information regarding the pathogenesis of the effusion.",

A survey of the literature neither reveals published evidence to support this classification nor studies showing how the cut-off values for the markers conventionally used to classify PEs were derived. Studies assessing the sensitivity and specificity of these markers in classifying PEs correctly are also lacking. The large and variable number of disorders associated with modified transudates and the fact that this category has overlapping protein content and cellularity with transudates and exudates, limit the current veterinary classification scheme of PEs.",

Animals that received diuretics before presentation were included. A full physical examination and complete blood count, serum biochemistry profile were performed on each cat. Pleural fluid samples, collected by thoracocentesis in all cats, were divided into three aliquots and stored in K 3 -EDTA, plain and fluoride oxalate tubes. The serum and plain pleural fluid samples were centrifuged and separated within 30 min and processed within 48 h of collection. An automated cell count and a cytological examination by a board certified clinical pathologist were performed. All biochemical parameters from the blood and pleural fluid were measured with validated feline assays using an OpeRA Chemistry Analyzer (Bayer PLC, Berkshire, UK) at the QMHA. Thoracic radiographs were obtained from all cats. When PE volume precluded good thoracic radiological assessment they were repeated post-thoracocentesis. Further tests [eg, abdominal ultrasonography or radiography, echocardiography, electrocardiogram, serum total T 4 , feline leukaemia and feline immunodeficiency virus status (by rapid immunochromatographic method, Speed Duo FeLV/FIV, Vetlab Supplies, UK), feline coronavirus (FCoV) antibody titre (by immunofluorescence as previously described)] 12 were performed as clinically indicated to achieve a definitive diagnosis.

In our study, classifying PEs into only exudate or transudate, according to the pathogenic process of formation, a TPp cut-off value of 35.0 g/l enabled separation of these two groups with similar accuracy to that reported in human studies. 2, 21, 22 The reason for a higher cut-off value compared with that in humans may be due to the small number of animals enrolled in our study, the different level of serum protein of these two species, or the fact that 3/9 cats with a transudate received diuretic treatment prior to sampling (see later discussion). The same reasons could also explain why in our study a cut-off for TPr of 0.57 instead of 0.50 (cut-off used in human medicine) 2 for exudates was obtained. In the only other veterinary study 23 in which TPr was used to distinguish a transudate from an exudate a cut-off of 0.50 was used. No information was given regarding statistical method of selection of this value which enabled correct classification of 19/ 20 effusions for which this parameter was available. 23 In human medicine it has been noted that very few transudates have TPp that fall into the exudative range. 5, 17, 24 Most of these have been associated with administration of diuretics before sample collection, which leads to removal of the water component of the effusion resulting in relatively higher TPp and TPr values. 25, 26 To by-pass this problem in human medicine it is recommended that if a patient is thought to have a transudative effusion by clinical criteria, but the fluid is identified as exudative by Light's criteria, a serum-effusion albumin gradient (serum albumin concentration minus PE albumin concentration) should be calculated. 17, 24, 27 The albumin gradient may be more reliable than the TPr after diuretic therapy due to relatively increased non-albuminaemic protein that originates and then accumulates in the pleural space or due to the mathematics of a gradient that may be more representative of the TPr. 5 In our study, the PE albumin value was not measured; it was, therefore, impossible to calculate the serumeffusion albumin gradient in the cats that received diuretic treatment before thoracocentesis. Animal and human studies have shown that increases in hydrostatic pressure can increase TPp and, therefore, also TPr by the opening of larger pores in the endothelium with elevated hydrostatic pressure. 28 This situation may also occur secondary to CHF 28 and might explain why, in this study, one transudate associated with CHF that had not received diuresis prior to sampling had an increased TPp value.",

Interestingly in all these patients, serum total proteins were also below the reference interval (reference interval 64e80 g/l). These results are not surprising as most of the protein content of the exudative effusion is derived from the serum protein leakage through the compromised pulmonary or pleural microvasculature 5 and a positive correlation between serum and pleural fluid total protein have been previously demonstrated. 29 The importance of TPp should, therefore, be questioned when classifying effusions in dysproteinaemic patients. As the majority of, but not all proteins in the PE are derived from the serum, the TPr should not be affected to the same degree in the case of altered serum protein value. In fact only one of the three cats mentioned above had a low TPr. Similar conclusions were reported in a study in humans with PE. 29 Although in humans TNCCp has not been found useful to distinguish an exudate from a transudate, 30, 1, 21 in veterinary medicine a TNCCp > 7000 ml is one of the suggested cut-off values used for this purpose. 15 In our study using this value to classify the effusion as an exudate, a sensitivity of 55% and a specificity of 100% were obtained with an accuracy of 75% (data not shown). Using ROC curve analysis we derived a cut-off value of 5900 ml which decreased specificity, but increased sensitivity and overall accuracy of the test (Table 2) . Although TNCCp does not appear to be as powerful as TPr and LDHp in correctly discriminating between a transudate and an exudate, cytological analysis and differential cell count of the fluid remains of paramount importance, as described in human medicine, 24 in investigating the cause of an exudate.",

In Light's original study, LDHp was found significantly lower in human with transudates and a cut-off value of >200 IU/l was derived to separate transudates from exudates. 2 Also in our study, LDHp was found to be significantly lower in cats with a transudate and using LDHp > 226 IU/l as a cut-off value, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 100% in dividing transudates from exudates. The small difference in the optimum cut-off value between our study and Light's original study could be due to the small number of animals enrolled in our study, the use of different assays to measure LDH or the different inter-species levels of tissue LDH. To compare the LDHp value measured with different assays in human medicine, a pre-determined cut-off for LDHp is no longer used, but instead, two-thirds of the upper limit of 'normal' serum LDH have been suggested (modified Light's criteria). 34 A reference range for serum feline LDH was not available, therefore, this method could not be used.",

Using only TPr and LDHp, but not LDHr, with the same cut-off values to Light's original study a previous veterinary study classified all the 22 cats with PE in the study correctly. 23 In this study no explanation for the lack of use of LDHr was given neither was information given regarding how the cut-off value for LDHp was derived. 23 In our study, simultaneous use of these three tests failed to perform as well as in Light's study ( Table 2 ). The compartmentalised elevation of LDH concentration in the exudative processes may explain why the LDHr has no role in the diagnostic separation of PE into transudate and exudate, 29, 35 and why when this parameter is used to separate an exudate from a transudate the sensitivity decreases, as also showed in more recent humans studies. 3e5 Although RBCs contain a large amount of LDH, one human study demonstrated no correlation between the pleural fluid LDH level and pleural fluid RBC, 2 while another supported a relationship between RBC and LDH. 36 In our study, a positive correlation was found between LDHp and RBC in the effusion, but correcting the LDHp value to the RBC number according the Eid formula 36 (corrected LDH \u00bc measured LDH \u00c0 0.0012 \u00c2 RBC count/ml) did not affect our results (data not shown).

Three animals (effusions number: 18, 19 and 20; Table 1 ) had a very low GLUp concentration. Proposed mechanisms to explain the low glucose in the PE include use of glucose by pleural fluid constituents including leukocytes and free malignant cells, pleural membrane metabolism, especially by malignant cells, and abnormal transfer of glucose across diseased pleural membranes. 40 Interestingly, all three effusions with low GLUp in our study had very high nucleated cell count (respectively 270.0, 81.2 and 22.1 \u00c2 10 9 /l) compared to the other effusion samples (values from 0.3e9.2 \u00c2 10 9 /l), and an inverse correlation between GLUp and TNCC was present. Therefore, the increased TNCC may have been responsible directly or indirectly for the low GLUp in these three effusions. Further studies should evaluate if GLUp and PE pH may be used for diagnostic or prognostic purposes.",

Nevertheless, it probably did not affected our major findings that LDHp and TPr are the most reliable parameters in segregating a transudate from an exudate as supported by previous studies in humans and cats. 27, 34, 23 Secondly, in the transudate group we did not have any cat which developed PE due to decreased colloid osmotic pressure. Unfortunately, this type of effusion seems to be extremely rare in the feline population as apparent from our data and three other feline studies 23, 42, 43 on PE in which only one cat in a total of 226 could be identified with this type of effusion. Thirdly in the case of chylous effusions our classification scheme fails to identify the pathophysiology of pleural fluid formation. In fact, due to the inflammatory reaction of the pleura associated with this type of fluid, 16 the resultant effusion will have exudative characteristics whether formed secondary to an increase in hydrostatic pressure of the lymphatic vessels or due to increased permeability.",
