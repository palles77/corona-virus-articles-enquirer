Although recombinant human MBL (rhMBL) trials have focused on reconstitution therapy, safety studies have identified no barriers to its use at higher levels. Ebola viruses cause fatal hemorrhagic fevers for which no treatment exists and that are feared as potential biothreat agents. We found that mice whose rhMBL serum concentrations were increased >7fold above average human levels survived otherwise fatal Ebola virus infections and became immune to virus rechallenge. Because Ebola glycoproteins potentially model other glycosylated viruses, rhMBL may offer a novel broadspectrum antiviral approach.",

MBL is a C-type lectin that recognizes hexose sugars including mannose, glucose, fucose, and N-acetylglucosamine on the surface of many pathogens. It does not recognize the terminal carbohydrates galactose and sialic acid on normal host cells. Therefore, MBL preferentially recognizes glycosylated viruses including influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronovirus (SARS-CoV), Ebola virus, and Marburg virus. It also recognizes many glycosylated grampositive and gram-negative bacteria [1, 2] . As a result of common genetic variants, MBL serum levels in humans range from 0 to 10,000 ng/mL. Thirty percent of the human population has levels ,500 ng/mL, which are associated with increased susceptibility to infections in children and immunocompromised individuals [3] .",

Doses of plasma-derived MBL and rhMBL designed to increase MBL concentrations to physiologic levels (.1000 ng/mL) in MBL-deficient humans were safe in early trials and did not elicit antibodies [3] [4] [5] .

They constitute important biological threat agents because of their high mortality rates, capacity for large-scale dissemination, and potential for causing social disruption. Currently, there are no US Food and Drug Administrationapproved therapeutic agents available to prevent or treat these lethal viral infections. Filovirus surface glycoproteins (GPs) are heavily glycosylated and contain high-mannose. As a result, MBL binds to Ebola and Marburg viruses and mediates complement-dependent virus neutralization [2] . Importantly, their surface glycoprotein structures are characteristic of a broad group of viruses in which N-linked glycosylation contributes to viral virulence [7] . Reasoning that MBL treatment is likely to be safe at supraphysiological levels, we evaluated an in vivo Ebola virus model to explore the possibility of using MBL as an immunotherapeutic agent. Our results showed that supraphysiological doses of MBL rescued $40% of mice from lethal challenges when administered pre-or post-Ebola virus exposure.",

RhMBL effectively blocked Ebola GP interactions with DC-SIGN, and HIV particles lacking gp120/gp41 pseudotyped with Ebola or Marburg GPs were neutralized by the lectin complement pathway [2] . To develop an in vivo test of rhMBL effectiveness, we determined that 100 ng/mL of rhMBL was the minimum concentration needed to inhibit >90% infectivity of HepG2 cells using Ebola GP pseudotyped lentiviral particles and to inhibit >90% infectivity of Vero E6 cells using recombinant Ebola Zaire virus (Mayinga strain)-eGFP (data not shown). We had previously found that a single intraperitoneal dose of 75 lg of rhMBL reconstituted the lectin complement pathway in MBL-knockout mice [1] . We compared the pharmacokinetic parameters (Table 1) Intraperitoneal administration of 100 pfu of native Ebola Zaire virus (3000 3 LD 50 ) is uniformly fatal in mice. Treatment with 75 lg of rhMBL per dose every 12 hours failed to protect mice from that virus inoculum. Therefore, we increased rhMBL to 350 lg administered every 12 hours for 10 days starting either 1 hour before or 12 hours after Ebola virus challenge ( Figure 1A and 1B). When treatment was started 1 hour before virus infection, the supraphysiological dose increased survival to . 40% of mice in several trials ( Figure 1A) . We then started treatment 12 hours after viral infection. We compared survival in wild-type and complement component 3 (C3)-deficient mice as the inhibitory effects of MBL on Ebola virus are mediated by complement in cell culture [2] . Once again we saw an increase in survival from 0% to .40% in rhMBL-treated mice, and survival was dependent on an intact complement pathway, since C3deficient mice did not survive ( Figure 1B ). All inoculated mice showed signs of infection according to standardized observation scores and weight loss, and surviving mice had detectable Ebola virus-specific antibodies 28 days after infection (data not shown).",

Average lymphocyte counts were also higher in MBL-treated mice compared with controls (5500 cells/mL vs 2800 cells/mL, respectively). A similar trend was seen for platelet counts, which averaged 726,000 cells/ mL in the treatment group and 239,000 cells/mL in the controls. These differences were statistically significant for platelet counts on day 5 (672,000 cells/mL vs 322,000 cells/mL, P 5 .014; Figure 1C ). In a separate experiment, spleens were harvested on day 5 after infection (4 sham-treated and 4 MBL-treated mice). Constituent cell populations were assayed by flow cytometry. Numbers of splenic CD3 2 CD19 1 cells (B lymphocytes) and CD11b 1 granulocytes were higher in MBL-treated mice (89.2% vs 85.1%, P 5 .019; 17.6% vs 12.8%, P 5 .04, respectively). The RNA viral loads as determined by RT-PCR in blood, liver, and spleen 5 days after infection were similar in sham-and rhMBL-treated mice (P . .05). Virus titers in blood were generally lower on days 1 and 3 in rhMBL-treated mice as determined by plaque assays (P . .05; Figure 1D ).

We tested protective immunity in 5 seropositive mice that survived initial infection by rechallenging them with native Ebola virus 28 days after initial infection. It is noteworthy that all MBL-treated survivors also survived the second viral challenge.

Although this approach was remarkably effective, the advent of newly emerging or drug-resistant viruses that threaten humans calls for the development of more broadly active agents targeting viral components shared among viruses. N-glycosylation of viral envelopes is an important such target shared between influenza, HIV, HCV, West Nile virus, SARS-CoV, Hendra virus, Nipah virus, and filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg viruses) [7] .

(A) Mouse survival when treated with rhMBL before Ebola virus inoculation. Sham-treated wild-type mice were compared with wild-type mice receiving 350 lg of rhMBL (referred to as Rx) administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) every 12 hours starting 1 hour before mouse-adapted Ebola virus (EBO) challenge (100 pfu). Shown is a Kaplan-Meier probability curve for mouse survival at the indicated times (*log-rank Mantel-Cox test, P 5 .0075). (B) Mouse survival when treated with rhMBL after Ebola virus inoculation. Sham-treated mice were compared with mice receiving 350 lg of rhMBL administered i.p. every 12 hours starting 12 hours after mouse-adapted Ebola virus challenge (100 pfu). Both wild-type (WT) and knockout mice lacking complement component 3 (C3 KO) were compared. Shown is a Kaplan-Meier probability curve for mouse survival at the indicated times (*log-rank analyses; WT: sham-treated vs rhMBL-treated, P 5 .0013; rhMBL-treated: WT versus C3 KO, P 5 .0003). (C) Platelet count analyses. RhMBL-treated mice had significantly lower platelet counts on day 5 after Ebola virus inoculation than sham-treated mice (*P 5 .014). (D) Viral plaque assays. RhMBL-treated mice tended to have lower viral titers than sham-treated mice but the differences were not statistically significant. (E) Intrahepatic cytokine responses. RhMBL-treated mice had lower proinflammatory and T helper cell type 2 (Th2) cytokine titers in liver homogenates on day 5 after inoculation (P values as shown). (F) Anti-Ebola virus titers in mice surviving Ebola virus infection. Fifteen wild-type mice received a 10-day course of rhMBL administered every 12 hours that was started 1 hour before inoculation with 100 pfu of mouse-adapted Ebola virus as indicated. Antibody (Ab) titers were obtained on day 21 and again on day 56. Mice were rechallenged with Ebola virus on day 28. The reciprocals of anti-Ebola virus antibody titers in 5 mice successfully treated with rhMBL are shown on the indicated days after initial and repeat challenges with Ebola virus.",
