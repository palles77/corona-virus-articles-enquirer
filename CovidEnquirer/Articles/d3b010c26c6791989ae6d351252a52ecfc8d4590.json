NCBI Blast searches revealed SPAG9 nucleotide sequence similarities with ESTs of various cancerous tissues. In the present study, we compared the efficiency of two independent SPAG9 specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) constructs, BS/U6/spag9 and BS/U6/spag9-I, to ablate the SPAG9 expression in mammalian cells. A positive correlation between the ratio of target gene versus siRNA and the suppression of SPAG9 expression was observed. Further, the cotransfection of BS/U6/spag9 with pcDNA-SPAG9 and pFlag-CMV2-JNK-3 resulted in specific suppression of SPAG9 without affecting JNK-3 expression. The present investigation will eventually extend the application of SPAG9 siRNA in in vivo targeting experiments that aim to define the SPAG9 functional genomics in tumor and reproductive biology.",

MAPK interaction studies demonstrated that SPAG9 functions as a scaffolding protein exhibiting higher binding affinity to JNK3 and JNK2 compared to JNK1 [1, 2] . This interaction is interesting in view of the important regulatory role played by MAPKs in cell survival, proliferation, apoptosis, and tumor development [7] . The role of SPAG9 in MAPK signaling and its expression in various cancers such as esophageal adenocarcinoma [8] and Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) [9] suggest its important function in cancer biology. In addition, SPAG9 sequence analysis revealed nucleotide sequence similarities with ESTs of various cancerous tissues and cancer cell lines. Recently, sperm protein 17 (Sp17) [10] and sperm c lysozyme-like protein 1 (SLLP1) expression [11] was also reported in various cancer tissues. Therefore, it may be interesting to study the siRNA-mediated inhibition of SPAG9 expression to address the possible eventual role of SPAG9 in tumor and reproductive biology.",

Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), when introduced to cells, interferes with the expression of homologous genes, disrupting their normal function. In mammals, transient delivery of synthetic BBRC short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which resemble the processed form of standard double-stranded RNAi trigger, is effective in silencing mammalian genes. Issues related to transfer efficiency and duration of the silencing effect, however, restrict the spectrum of applications of siRNAs in mammals. These shortcomings of siRNAs have been solved by the cellular expression of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAi) from DNA vectors. shRNAi are indistinguishable from siRNAs in terms of efficacy and mechanism but can be produced within cells from mammalian expression vectors. In this way, shRNAi expression makes possible the creation of continuous cell lines and transgenic animals in which suppression of a target gene is stably maintained by RNAi [15] .",

The percentile fluorescence intensity in the treated cells is indicated by marker1 as compared to the control (only COS-1 cells), which is indicated by marker 2. The expression of SPAG9-GFP in the presence of empty vector BS/U6 revealed a fluorescence intensity of 78.37% as compared to 0.11% in the control cells (Fig. 2B ). Further the fluorescence intensity of SPAG9-GFP was measured in the presence of different concentrations of BS/U6/spag9. The results indicated a positive correlation between target gene (SPAG9-GFP) versus effector siRNA (BS/U6/spag9) ratio and the suppression of SPAG9-GFP expression as shown in Fig. 2B . The fluorescence intensity decreased drastically to 2.42% in the cells treated with 6.0 lg of BS/ U6/spag9 (Fig. 2B ) as compared to 78.37% fluorescence intensity of SPAG9-GFP alone, indicating the effective and dose-dependent suppression of SPAG9-GFP expression using RNAi approach.",

            "text": "The present investigation reports for the first time gene silencing of a sperm-specific protein using siRNA approach. SPAG9, a new member of JNK-interacting protein family, is a novel testis-specific protein exclusively expressed in testis [1, 19] . The amino acid sequence analysis revealed conservation of SPAG9 in human and non-human primates predicting functional interactions of proteins, as well as the evolutionary relationships between genomes [2, [4] [5] [6] 20] . MAPK interaction studies demonstrated that SPAG9 functions as a scaffolding protein exhibiting higher binding affinity to JNK3 and JNK2 compared to JNK1 [1, 2] . The interaction is important in view of the pleiotropic endpoints of JNK signaling pathways leading to cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, immune cell function, and embryonic morphogenesis [21] . In most cases, the functional consequences of interaction between JNKs and scaffolding proteins are not yet fully understood; however, they are likely to play an important role in regulating JNK signaling pathways towards a particular physiological event. A recent study demonstrated that IB1/JIP1 facilitates the signal transduction in pancreatic b-cell lines mediated by the interacting proteins. IB1/JIP-1 interacts with JNK through the JNK binding domain (JBD), a domain able to prevent apoptosis of pancreatic b-cell lines induced by IL-1b and thus act as a crucial regulator of survival in insulin-secreting cells [22] . Similarly, SPAG9 interacts with JNKs through its JBD, which exhibits a significant sequence identity to JBD of JIP1, JIP2, and JIP3. The earlier study involving SPAG9 mutant lacking JBD (SPAG9DLZDT) failed to show any interaction with JNK pathway, suggesting that JNK binding domain of SPAG9 is involved in JNK interaction [1] . Moreover, the expression of SPAG9 in various cancers such as esophageal adenocarcinoma [8] and Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) [9] thereby suggests the possible involvement of SPAG9 interactions with JNKs in signal transduction pathways leading to cellular proliferation and tumor growth. Recently, sperm protein 17 (Sp17) [10] and sperm c lysozyme-like protein 1 (SLLP1) expression [11] was also reported in various cancer tissues. Though at present the exact nature of involvement of SPAG9 in tumorigenesis is not known, further investigations are warranted. The present study provides more evidence for the existence of RNAi induced gene silencing in mammalian cells and also suggests possibilities for using RNAi as an effective tool to determine the functional genomics of SPAG9 in tumor and reproductive biology. Initially, we demonstrated the siRNA-mediated gene silencing of chimeric SPAG9-GFP using BS/U6/gfp, a construct, which has been already used and established for its siRNA function in mammalian cells by Sui and group [23] .",

            "text": "One more important aspect of siRNA studies is to explore the extent of siRNA specificity towards the gene of interest. siRNA-mediated gene silencing is generally believed to be highly sequence-specific. Tuschl and coworkers [18] demonstrated that even a single base mismatch between siRNA and its mRNA target abolished gene silencing. The caveats in specificity of gene silencing by RNAi mean there is an absolute requirement to test the selectivity of a siRNA before embarking on phenotype analysis. However, since RNAi, in contrast to the traditional knockout approach, does not completely eliminate the protein of interest, it was critical to evaluate the efficiency of siRNAs at the protein level. Therefore, we compared the silencing effect of two independent SPAG9 siRNAs (BS/U6/spag9 and BS/U6/spag9-I) on SPAG9 protein expression. The immunofluorescence and Western blotting results revealed that BS/U6/spag9 was fully competent to knockdown the SPAG9 expression. In contrast, SPAG9 expression was resistant to siRNA induced ablation using BS/U6/spag9-I. In addition, we evaluated the effect of BS/U6/spag9 on unrelated GFP and JNK3 proteins using SPAG9 as a positive control for determining the specificity of BS/U6/spag9. The expression of JNK-3 and GFP remained unaffected by BS/U6/spag9, suggesting that BS/U6/spag9 functions specifically to inhibit target gene and has no RNAi effect on unrelated gene expression.",

The present study is beneficial in terms of providing proof of concept for further employment of a lentiviral vectorbased siRNA approach in generating transgenic mice to study the functional genomics of SPAG9. Thus, the ease and convenience of deleting gene function combined with the ability to make transgenic animals using lentiviral vector-based RNAi would give a useful insight into exploring the biological function of SPAG9 in reproductive biology. Moreover, exploiting siRNA against SPAG9, which exhibits aberrant expression in various cancerous tissues, may give useful insight into the role of SPAG9 in cellular proliferation and programmed cell death and therefore warrants further investigations.",
