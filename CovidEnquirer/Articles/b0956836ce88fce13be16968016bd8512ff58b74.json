Methods Individuals related with the two SARS chains of transmission in Beijing in 2003 and a group of individuals isolated for medical observation in Haidian district of Beijing during the SARS outbreak were selected as subjects of study. Contactors with SARS patients and those with symptom development following the contacts were investigated via questionnaire. Serum samples were collected from super transmitters and tested for SARSCoV antibody by neutralization test and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results A total of 1 112 contactors were investigated in three surveys. Of them, 669 had a history of close contact with symptomatic SARS patients, 101 developed symptoms with a rate of 15.1%, 363 had a history of close contact with patients in their incubation period, none of whom developed symptoms (0%). Serum samples were collected from 32 highlyexposed individuals, of whom 13 developing SARS symptoms after contact had serum samples positive for SARSCoV antibody. Samples collected from the asymptomatic contactors were all negative for SARSCoV antibody. Conclusion SARS cases are infectious only during their symptomatic period and are noninfectious during the incubation period. Isolation for medical observation should be placed for individuals who are in close contact with symptomatic SARS patients. The results of our study are of decisive significance for the Ministry of Health to the definition of SARS close contactor.",

Sixtysix individuals had direct contact with the second generation of case Z (a male patient with cerebral infarction in the same ward beside with case C, at the age of 88 years), 13 of whom became symptomatic. The two super transmitters were the elderly with cerebral infarction. A large number of individuals were involved in close contacts during emergency management, nursing care and visits.

No individual in contact with SARS patients (including super transmitters) in the incubation period developed symptoms in either of the typical transmission chains. Additionally, clinical manifestations were surveyed in the individuals isolated for medical observation due to the SARS epidemic, and the findings were consistent with those who contacted the patients in the incubation period. There was evidence that all the secondary cases had a history of close contact during the symptomatic period, while of those only having contact with the patients in the incubation period none developed illness, indicating that SARS cases were incapable of transmitting the disease to other human beings during the incubation period. Furthermore, no significant infection was detected in patients by neutralization test and ELISA for SARSCoV antibody in serum samples from medical workers and family members involved in the treatment of and care for two severe SARS patients (also super transmitters) in the early outbreak stage, indicating that the contactors in the incubation period were not infected either\u037e furthermore, serological tests also confirmed that SARS had no infectivity in the incubation period.",

The most risky ways of contact were: providing emergency treatment or operating the respirator without precautions in a relatively closed setting, accompanying a patient, sharing the same room, followed by sharing the same ward, visiting a patient in hospital, exposure to the secretions of patients and performing routine nursing care, which is consistent with the reported findings [1314] . Moreover, macroobservation of SARS epidemic found that the highest incidence rate for SARS was seen among the medical workers, accounting for 28.67% of all the cases [15] , also failing to support the claim of SARS infectivity during the incubation period (even in the early symptomatic period) because SARS patients would inevitably have close contact with their family members, colleagues and classmates before illness onset or in the early stage. If the patients had infectivity in the incubation period, the infections would have emerged earlier and more frequently among their family members, colleagues and classmates, rather than among medical workers at the highest risk in the epidemic [1617] .",
