            "text": "Background: Ventilator-associated events are common in mechanically ventilated patients. They are associated with more days on mechanical ventilation, longer intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and increased risk of mortality. Theoretically, interventions that prevent ventilator-associated events should also reduce associated morbidity. We evaluated the Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program approach to improve the care of mechanically ventilated patients. Methods: All mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the ICU between October 1, 2015, and October 31, 2016, were prospectively monitored for the development of ventilator-associated events according to the National Healthcare Safety Network criteria. A process care bundle (endotracheal intubation with subglottic suctioning, head-of-bed elevation 30\u00b0, target sedation scores, daily spontaneous awakening trials, spontaneous breathing trials), daily delirium assessment, and an early mobility protocol were instituted. The bundle compliance, ventilator-associated events rates, ICU length of stay, and mortality rate were noted. The database allowed viewing of current rates, trends, and averages of all participating sites. Results: In the study period, 2,321 patients were admitted to the ICU, and 1,231 required mechanical ventilation (10,342 ventilator days). There were 115 ventilator-associated events: 82 ventilator-associated conditions, 15 infection-related ventilator-associated conditions, and 18 possible cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia. The ICU mortality rate was 13.3%, compared with 28.7% for those mechanically ventilated patients with ventilator-associated events (P = .0001). There was increased compliance for spontaneous awakening trials (51.5%-76.9%, P = .0008) and spontaneous breathing trials (54.2%-72.2%, P = .02) and a decrease in infection-related ventilator-associated conditions (4.2-3.5 per 1,000 days), possible cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia (2.1-1.7 per 1,000 days), ICU mortality (45.3%-19.1%, P = .045), and",

            "text": "In 2004, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) 100,000 lives campaign introduced the concept of a \"care bundle\" for the prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 1 A care bundle identifies a set of key interventions that, when implemented together as a best practice approach, are expected to improve patient outcomes. 2 In recent years, approaches to the care of mechanically ventilated patients have evolved from fixating only on VAP prevention to focusing on a more comprehensive strategy based on the recent finding of benefit from the combined approach of the ABCDE bundle (Awakening and Breathing trial Coordination, Delirium management and Early mobilization) 3 and the Wake Up and Breathe Collaborative trial. 4 Although previous improvement initiatives used VAP rates as the primary outcome measure, it has been increasingly recognized that mechanical ventilation (MV) causes harm beyond just VAP. Hence, wider outcome measures were needed to determine the value and success of safety programs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, together with several critical care societies, convened a group to address the limitations of the National Healthcare Safety Network definition of injury caused by MV, and they proposed a new approach in 2013. 5 Besides VAP, the new algorithm uses objective criteria for the diagnosis of ventilator-associated events and conditions and infection-related ventilator-associated complications. This approach thereby broadens the definition of harm suffered by ventilated patients beyond pneumonia to include pulmonary edema, atelectasis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. 6 The Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program (CUSP) approach was developed by patient safety researchers at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland. 7 CUSP is designed to improve teamwork and safety culture and to guide organizations to learn from mistakes by using a validated and structured framework. 8 CUSP involves a repetitious process that trains a multidisciplinary team about the science of safety, asking them to identify defects, learn from them, implement improvement tools, and establish a partnership with senior leaders. 9 Key components include identifying evidence-based interventions that improve the outcomes of interest, converting these interventions into behaviors, placing value on the wisdom of frontline staff, and empowering frontline staff to be actively involved in safety improvements. The CUSP intervention has achieved great success in reducing VAP, central line\u00c0associated bloodstream infections, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, surgical care complications, mortality, and associated costs. 10, 11 Our hospital's Infection Control and Intensive Care departments implemented a VAP prevention program in 2003, which led to the reduction of VAP rates from 19.1 to 0 per 1,000 ventilator days in 2015. 12 Despite our success in reducing the VAP rates, our data indicated that intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS) (9.8 vs 8.5 days) and mortality rates (36% vs 28.7%) were both higher in the post-VAP prevention bundles compared with the pre-VAP prevention intervention group, 12 implying that merely decreasing the rate of VAP was not enough. We needed to implement other strategies to optimize patient care to improve outcomes. We joined the Johns Hopkins Armstrong Institute Comprehensive Unit-Based Safety Program for Mechanically Ventilated Patients and Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (CUSP 4 MVP-VAP) project in October 2015 with the objective of improving the care delivery process and reducing the mortality of our mechanically ventilated patients. This article describes the impact of implementing the CUSP 4 MVP-VAP project on patient care in our ICUs at the Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs in Riyadh.",

VAE surveillance has a quality metric character and appears to identify potential safety opportunities to improve care and outcomes for patients. 19 Theoretically, interventions most likely to prevent VAEs are those that help patients avoid intubation, minimize the duration of MV, or prevent the conditions that most commonly trigger a VAE (pneumonia, volume overload, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and atelectasis). 20 Use of high-flow nasal oxygen for hypoxemic and noninvasive ventilation for hypercapnic respiratory failure may avoid intubation. Minimizing sedation, performing daily coordinated SATs and SBTs, and perhaps early mobility are strategies to decrease the duration of MV. Strategies to prevent pneumonia, volume overload, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and atelectasis include HOB elevation, conservative fluid management, conservative blood transfusion thresholds, low tidal volume ventilation, and early mobility. 14 These interventions are consistent with the best care practices advocated by the ABCDEF bundle, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America's recommendations to prevent VAP. [21] [22] [23] Growing data support that implementing and optimizing these practices can lower VAE rates and improve patient outcomes. The CUSP 4MVP-VAP project was engendered to continue this wider focus of implementing an evidence-based practice bundle while caring for MV patients.",

This is similar to data published from 56 ICUs in Maryland and Pennsylvania with 69,417 ventilated patient-days in which compliance with SAT and SBT was 77.5% and 71%, respectively. 24 Our ICUs have a nurse-led sedation vacation protocol and target sedation scores for all sedated patients. Furthermore, we have an SBT protocol that is respiratory therapist driven. Our low compliance rates could highlight the difficulty of translating evidence-based practice to bedside, or they may represent a defect in our protocol design preventing meaningful change in the practice behavior and culture of our front-line staff.",

Early and progressive mobilization has been demonstrated to be both safe and feasible for patients admitted to critical care. 25 Implementing early mobility programs has led to improvements in physical function and mobility levels, significant reductions in both ICU and hospital LOS, and ventilation days and a reduction in both the incidence and duration of delirium. 26 In fact, the ABCDE bundle is centered on approaches to implement the Integrated pain, agitation, and delirium clinical practice guidelines to reduce delirium and weakness related to oversedation, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and immobility in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients. 27 Despite this, point prevalence surveys have shown that rehabilitation levels remain low. Goddard and colleagues, 28 using a Theoretical Domains Framework of behavior change, found that the social influences domain (local champions, ICU leadership, discord between team members and family members) and behavioral regulation domain (feedback and having a unit protocol) may act as barriers or facilitators to early rehabilitation. Based on these findings, we formulated a multidisciplinary team and a mobility protocol to provide tools to standardize the care of our patients (Appendix 1).",

Despite its strengths, our study has several potential limitations. First, a reduction in VAE rates might be beyond the effect of just implementing the bundle, because the VAE rates might have decreased secondary to other simultaneous infection control projects in our ICUs. Second, this was not a preintervention and postintervention study, so analyzing the full effect of the bundle is difficult. Third, despite having standardized data collection techniques and sources, team members might be motivated to demonstrate improvement and potentially could bias results. Fourth, we report VAE rates per 1,000 ventilator days, and any intervention that decreases ventilator days may paradoxically increase VAE rates and underestimate the impact of the intervention on VAE outcomes. Fifth, ICU LOS may depend on multiple complex factors and not only VAEs. Finally, the data represent a cohort study from a single center, and our inventions might not be generalized to other institutions.",
