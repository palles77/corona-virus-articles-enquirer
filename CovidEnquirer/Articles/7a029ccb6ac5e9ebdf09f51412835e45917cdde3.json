            "text": "Little attention has been directed towards investigating how senior managers and boards approach strategic decision-making when dealing with shock events as compared to strategic decision-making in a stable environment. This paper presents evidence to suggest that strategic decision-making following a shock event involves a more intuitive, less analytical and less consultative approach, while decisionmaking in a stable environment is characterised by a more cooperative, formal and analytical process. Decision-making following a shock event tends to be simplified and fast, whereas decision-making in a stable environment tends to be comprehensive and slow. Furthermore, the strategic role of the board transforms following a shock event from a limited involvement in strategy setting to a strong involvement in the setting of strategy. This research has important management implications signifying that crisis management must increasingly focus on building an organisation's ability to reach swift decisions in crisis situations and avoid analysis paralysis. r",

Events such as the 11 September attacks on the World Trade Centre in 2001, the Bali bomb attack in 2002 and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 have had a dramatic impact on organisations in the tourism and hospitality industry (Ritchie, 2004) . The 11 September attacks led to a sharp decline in worldwide commercial passenger traffic and contributed to the bankruptcy of United Airlines, US Airways, Hawaiian Airlines and National Airlines (Kim & Gu, 2004) . Washington's hotel industry experienced a strong decline in room sales due to the closure of Reagan National Airport following the 2001 terrorist attacks (Stafford, Yu, & Armoo, 2002) . Similarly, the SARS outbreak dealt a severe blow to many organisations in the Asian tourism industry. Taiwan, coping with the third largest SARS outbreak, had a 50 percent decrease in overseas visitors reducing hotel room occupancy by 40 percent (Min, 2005) while the life, work and travelling behaviour of Chinese domestic tourists was greatly affected by SARS (Wen, Huimin, & Kavanaugh, 2005) .",

It will also contribute towards a better understanding of strategy development, as it is the patterning of strategic issue responses over time that underlies the strategy formulation process (Mintzberg, 1978) .

            "text": "There are various definitions of crisis in the literature. Pearson and Clair (1998) for example, define crisis as ''a low-probability, high-impact event that threatens the viability of the organization and is characterized by ambiguity of cause, effect, and means of resolution, as well as a belief that decisions must be made swiftly'' (p. 60). This definition highlights three important aspects of a crisis. First, a crisis is a major, unpredictable event that is likely to interfere with normal business operations and has the potential to threaten organisational survival (Pearson, Misra, Clair, & Mitroff, 1997) . Second, a crisis has a low probability of occurring and includes an element of surprise. Finally, a crisis is characterised by time pressures, requiring a quick response in order to minimise its impact. Faulkner (2001) argued that 'crisis' describes a situation ''where the root cause of an event is, to some extent, selfinflicted through such problems as inept management structures and practices or a failure to adapt to change'' (p. 136). Hence, crises represent situations where the cause of the problem is internal and associated with certain actions (or inactions) of the organisation, while situations ''where an enterprise y is confronted with sudden unpredictable catastrophic changes over which it has little control'' were termed a ''disaster'' (Faulkner, 2001, p. 136) . Therefore, in his view, disasters are caused externally, either by natural phenomena or external human actions. Prideaux, Laws, and Faulkner (2003) argued ''there is a need to examine complex situations where numerous crises, disasters and political system failures act in unison to create one or more shocks'' (p. 477). They offer a classification of shocks based on severity, probability and level of certainty. The most severe types of shocks are those that ''are not anticipated and may be the result of a crisis or disaster'' (p. 484).",

This view is in line with Faulkner's (2001) notion of a triggering event, which is significant enough to challenge the structure, operations or survival of an organisation. Additionally, shock events do not necessarily lead to negative outcomes, but may have ''transformational connotations'' (Faulkner, 2001, p. 137) leading to positive outcomes (Faulkner & Vikulov, 2001; Meyer, 1982; Prideaux et al., 2003) .",

To preserve anonymity, we call this airport FlyRight. All Australian airports are now owned or controlled by private lessee companies and consortiums or local governments (Kain & Webb, 2003) . Following privatization in 1998 airport pricing was regulated, effectively capping prices for aeronautical services for 5 years (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) at rates equivalent to the pricing structure prior to deregulation.

In the face of increasing competition from airports in close geographic proximity FlyRight had been considering how to change the revenue base to move away from landed tonnes towards a passenger service charge. Ansett's demise allowed FlyRight to demonstrate to the regulatory authorities that if we did nothing we would be bankrupt. This change enabled us to move away from an everdiminishing revenue stream, because airlines were putting more and more passengers on fewer and fewer aircraft, to a situation whereby we were charging the airlines per passenger. The airlines embraced this revenue structure because they could charge the fee as a straight airport tax, which was perceived as a fee that was beyond the airlines control. y Following the changed revenue base FlyRight went from a marginal corporation to becoming a very profitable organisation with a revenue increase of 170 percent.",

When Ansett came along that gave us the means by which to push it through quickly, because without that change in the pricing regime we would not be here today. It had to change quickly because of the shock event''. On 13 May 2002, the Australian Government announced that the pricing regimes at Australian airports were to be liberalised and subjected only to price monitoring (rather than price capping) by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for 5 years from 1 July 2002, allowing all Australian airport operators to seek growth in profits (Kain & Webb, 2003) .",

Hence, the board became more involved in setting the strategy after the shock event, simplified its decisionmaking process and quickly endorsed a course of action.

Finally, our study suggests that in the period following a shock event, the challenge for any organisation is to make decisions quickly and accurately. Managers must be able to balance ''gut feeling'' (acting without thinking) with ''analysis paralysis'' (thinking instead of acting) (Clark & Harman, 2004) .",

            "text": "In particular, this research illustrates that decisionmaking following a shock event relies more on intuition and experience than on analysis. This finding is in line with research by Khatri and Ng (2000) who found that the use of intuition was positively associated with organisational performance in an unstable environment, but was negatively correlated with performance in a stable environment. Intuition, however, requires ''intimate knowledge of the subject in question'' (Mintzberg, 1994, p. 325 ) which may take years to develop, whereas analysis is available whenever ''clever analysts can get their hands on good hard data'' (Mintzberg, 1994, p. 325) . Hence, in addition to establishing proactive scanning and planning procedures, organisations need to develop an organisational culture that fosters intuition, flexibility and strategic thinking over a long period of time. Clark and Harman (2004) support this point by arguing that ''crisis management is not about researching and planning contingencies for every possible crisis that might occur, but rather about developing the capability within the organization to react flexibly and to make the right snap decisions that will be required when a crisis does happen' ' (p. 40) .",

Finally, guidelines concerning the role of the board following a shock event should be developed. For example, companies can set policies relating to board majority requirements and board meeting frequency.",

Further research is needed to test the validity of the research findings by using a larger sample of organisations in the tourism industry, along with other volatile industries, e.g. information technology or telecommunications. In addition, further research should investigate to what extent different ownership forms (e.g. family firms, privately owned firms, state owned enterprises or partnerships), different organisational sizes (e.g. small, medium or largesized) or different organisational structures (e.g. functional, divisional, matrix or network structures) influence strategic decision-making following a shock event. Finally, a longitudinal approach is recommended to assess whether shock events provide a lasting impact on strategic decisionmaking. Such endeavours will enable a model of strategic decision-making following a shock event to be advanced, thus yielding further insights into the peculiarities of decision-making in the period after a shock event.",
