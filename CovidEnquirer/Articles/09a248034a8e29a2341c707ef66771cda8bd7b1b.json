The necessity and feasibility of such a vaccine for human and veterinary application is discussed. Developmental stages within the life cycle of the parasite that might act as possible targets for vaccine development are summarised, as well as the target antigens oered by molecular biology and immunology studies. Vaccination trials against cryptosporidiosis carried out so far, including the active and passive immunisation approach, are also overviewed. It seems that with respect to a Cryptosporidium vaccine two target groups can be considered: children of the developing world and neonatal ruminants. Antigens representing possible candidates for a subunit vaccine were identi\u00aeed based on their function, location and/or the immune response they evoke. While the active vaccination of newborn calves, lambs and goat kids has to face a number of important limitations, the passive immunisation approach, where dams were immunised to protect their progeny by colostral transfer, was proven to be a valuable alternative. Finally, a number of points of action for the near future are put forward. #",

In terms of clinical symptoms, an analysis of data from 78 studies showed that altogether, C. parvum is detected in faeces in 2.1% of diarrhoeas in industrialised countries and 6.1% in developing countries. In AIDS, a review of 22 studies showed that Cryptosporidium infection was diagnosed in 24% of diarrhoeas in developing countries and 13.8% in developed countries [3] .

            "text": "The second question that should be asked before considering development of a vaccine for human cryptosporidiosis is:``can protection against clinical cryptosporidiosis be achieved through vaccination?'' The most convincing evidence that the immune response is involved in the control of human cryptosporidiosis is the fact that Cryptosporidium infection is one of the most devastating opportunistic complications of AIDS. Moreover, it was shown that in AIDS patients, the clinical outcome of cryptosporidiosis is related to the degree of immunosuppression, patients with CD4 counts of 180 mm \u00c0 3 or more being more likely to have self limited-infection [9] . There are also reports of patients who cleared Cryptosporidium infection following discontinuation of an immunosuppressive treatment [10] . However, the fact that the immune system is involved in the control of an established C. parvum infection does not necessarily imply that the immunity acquired after a primary contact with the parasite will be protective against future infections. Two experimental studies addressing this question have been published. The \u00aerst one showed that volunteers rechallenged with 500 oocysts 1 year after a primary exposure to C. parvum experienced a clinical illness with the same frequency as that after the primary infection. However, the severity of the symptoms and the intensity of infection were lower after the second infection [11] . Moreover, it was recently demonstrated that upon challenge with 500 to 5000 oocysts, the 50% infectious dose is 1880 oocysts in volunteers with pre-existing anti-C. parvum antibodies [12] , a more than 20-fold increase compared to the 50% infectious dose obtained in seronegative volunteers [13] . Finally, an epidemiological study performed in a region where cryptosporidiosis is highly endemic [14] showed that asymptomatic C. parvum infection is possible, suggesting that repeated exposure to the parasite may result in protective immunity.",

The answer to this question diers according to geographic and economic parameters. In industrialised countries, the control of clinical cryptosporidiosis probably relies on the development of new antiviral chemotherapeutic regimens for HIV infected patients and on improved procedures for water puri\u00aecation, more than on vaccination. On the other hand, a vaccinal approach could eventually be considered in countries with poor sanitary conditions where it is almost impossible to control transmission of the parasite. Indeed in these countries, the impact of cryptosporidiosis on child development, and the appalling cost of antiviral chemotherapy for AIDS patients confer to cryptosporidiosis a sig-ni\u00aecant public health importance. In this respect, a putative Cryptosporidium vaccine should be part of a multicomponent vaccine targeting C. parvum as well as other gastrointestinal pathogens of public health relevance.",

New clinico-epide-miological analyses should be performed in several distinct geographic areas to con\u00aerm the impact of cryptosporidiosis on the nutritional status and development of young children. The consequences of combined antiviral chemotherapy on AIDS cryptosporidiosis should also be evaluated with more hindsight. Finally, large population genetic and pathogenicity studies are necessary. Indeed, C. parvum isolates have been shown to classify in two genotypes, one being human speci\u00aec and the other being identi\u00aeed in humans and livestock [15\u00b119], and current data suggest that these genotypes have a distinct virulence [19\u00b121] . Moreover, Widmer et al. [22] recently described a higher degree of polymorphism of C. parvum isolates, and showed that recombination between the two main genotypes may occur. In any case, and would a vaccine for human cryptosporidiosis appear as a public health priority in future years, and such decision obviously needs additional information, more studies aimed at determining the genetic structure of C. parvum and characterising the pathogenicity of the dierent genotypes would be a preliminary requirement to ensure the choice of the most appropriate target.",

In the absence of other enteropathogens, mortality is higher in lambs than in calves [31] and morbidity can reach 100% [25, 32] . In birds cryptosporidiosis most often manifests as respiratory disease caused by Cryptosporidium baileyi [33] . Although avian cryptosporidiosis was long considered as an opportunistic disease, it recently became evident that its economic signi\u00aecance should not be underestimated (reviewed in [23] ). In piglets, cryptosporidiosis is most prevalent in weaned, 1\u00b1 2-month-old animals, but the infections are mostly asymptomatic [23] . In rabbits, experimental Cryptosporidium infection can cause mortality in suckling animals, but \u00aeeld outbreaks in this age-class are rarely detected [34] . In weaned rabbits, the infection causes only subclinical enteritis (Peeters JE. Recent advances in intestinal pathology of rabbits and further perspectives.

Thus, yes, the economic losses due to cryptosporidiosis in ruminants, especially in small ruminants, can justify the development of a vaccine. In avian species, cryptosporidiosis is clearly an emerging health problem and development of a vaccine could be very valuable, although it does not receive the highest priority. However, we have to realise that the necessity of a vaccine would not exist if preventive hygienic measures would have been explored more profoundly in animal husbandry [23] . A vaccine against cryptosporidiosis in ruminants would complete the gamut of already commercialised vaccines against enteropathogenic agents, including rotavirus, coronavirus, bovine viral diarrhoea virus, E. coli and Salmonella spp. (reviewed in [35] ). Further, the application of a Cryptosporidium vaccine would at least be more environmentally friendly and less subject to the development of resistance than those drugs under development for en masse treatment of newborns. Finally, it should be considered that the introduction of an animal vaccine against C. parvum might reduce the environmental contamination and consequently the frequency and/or the entity of waterborn cryptosporidiosis outbreaks in humans.",

In contrast to humans, the problems related to cryptosporidiosis in ruminants are restricted to newborns only. An age-related resistance has been observed in calves and lambs. Older animals raised in isolation of Cryptosporidium remain susceptible to infection, but the clinical signs are much less severe compared with what is observed in Cryptosporidiuminfected newborns [26, 36] . After primary exposure with C. parvum, ruminants become fully protected against challenge-infection, although the conception`primary exposure' should be considered with caution in animal cryptosporidiosis. Indeed, once the animals start excreting oocysts they contaminate their own environment and become`continuously exposed' to the parasite. Consequently, they will shed oocysts until a protective immunity has been acquired. A great range in clinical illness was observed among animals exposed under similar conditions. After receiving a single experimental infection dose of 1.5 \u00c210 6 oocysts at 1\u00b13 days of age, calves excreted oocysts for 4\u00b113 days and diarrhoea varied greatly in duration (from 4 to 17 days) and severity from calf to calf [37] . This variability, which is probably due to the dierent immunocompetence status of individual calves shortly after birth, most likely re\u00afecting distinct genetic make-ups, can hamper the application of a potential vaccine [38] .",

Because the placenta of ruminants is syndesmochorial, transplacental passage of immunoglobulin molecules is totally prevented and the neonates are born virtually agammaglobulinaemic. Newborn animals receive large amounts of passive IgG 1 from the colostrum via intestinal absorption during the \u00aerst 12 to 24 h of life (reviewed in [39] ). This passive immunisation of neonatal ruminants via colostral antibodies has been eectively exploited in many vaccination protocols. Most frequently, elevated antibody levels in (hyperimmune) colostrum were achieved by preparturient vaccination of the dams with toxoids, killed bacteria or inactivated viruses (reviewed in [40] ). Also, colostral lymphoid cells cross the gastrointestinal barrier and seem to in\u00afuence the immune response of the newborn [41] . Further, ruminant colostrum contains a variety of soluble immunomodulatory factors (reviewed in [42] ) which could be absorbed into the circulation of the suckling infant immediately after birth. Thus, the functional immunity which results from ingestion of colostrum is not mediated by maternal antibodies (predominantly IgG 1 ) alone, but probably also by a transfer of maternal lymphoid cells and of immunoregulatory cytokines.",

This obstacle can be avoided: (i) by administering colostrum free of antibodies directed against the vaccinal antigens, although we admit that this is dicult to perform in the \u00aeeld and probably only of importance in an experimental approach; (ii) by carefully selecting antigens that are not recognised by maternal antibodies. Here we refer to the development of T-cell vaccines against Theileria and Babesia, where antigens are selected on their potential to stimulate T-cells and not on their recognition by antibodies [44, 45] ; (iii) by administering the vaccine in mucosal or other sites, that are less sub-jected to neutralisation by maternal antibodies in circulation; or (iv) by nucleic acid vaccination. Moreover, any immune response provoked by an active vaccination of neonates must necessarily be a primary response with both a relative long period of latency and a low concentration of antibodies produced. Since animals can be exposed to Cryptosporidium from their day of birth, it is questionable whether an active vaccination is capable of mediating any signi\u00aecant immune protection against such an early infection. However, the Cryptosporidium vaccine would not be designed to evoke a sterile protection, but rather to reduce production losses caused by clinical illness.",

The oocyst wall is apparently a chemically and physically inert structure, thus unlikely to represent a good target for immunological intervention. However, it cannot be excluded that the attack of the oocyst by appropriate immune eector mechanisms could contrast with the onset of the infection by inhibiting excystation or the binding to putative host ligands by unknown oocyst wall components. Furthermore, it has been shown that the oocyst wall shares immunogenic epitopes with other parasite stages [53, 54] , suggesting that antibodies raised against these cross-reactive determinants on the oocyst wall may play a protective role later in the life cycle.",

            "text": "Sporozoites and merozoites are the invasive stages of the parasite. While sporozoites are released from the oocysts during excystation, merozoites are set free by the infected host cell after asexual development of the parasite. Microgametes are the third form of extracellular stages of Cryptosporidium which fertilise the macrogamont leading to zygote formation. The extracellular stages are most vulnerable to the conditions within the host intestine and are inactivated by physical and chemical in\u00afuences. They have to \u00aend and infect a host cell very quickly as they have a short life span. Tzipori and Griths [55] argue that due to the limited survival time in the gut lumen, chemotherapeutic and immunotherapeutic agents directed against the extracellular forms of C. parvum are unlikely to be highly eective. In regard to neutralising antibodies resulting from vaccination, eective concentrations have to be present at all times and at all possible sites of invasion. Indeed, escape of a single parasite to vaccinal immunity is likely to result in completion of the whole life cycle and the development of clinical disease, a problem similar to that of the pre-erythrocytic vaccine for malaria, that gives an`all or none' protection [56] . Obviously, such need for a 100% eective vaccination is a major diculty in this immunisation strategy. Nevertheless, in various reports the eect of neutralising immunoglobulins, including mAb or Ig from hyperimmune bovine colostrum and hen egg, has been demonstrated and the antigens have been localised on the surface of zoite stages, especially sporozoites (reviewed in [57, 58] ). Moreover, because zoite stages and microgametes occur freely in the intestinal lumen and are not surrounded by the host microvilli membrane, they are more likely to be phagocytosed and digested by Peyer's patch M-cells, and thus, their components are more likely to be presented to T-cells in a MHC class II-restricted way. CD4 + T-cells, that can respond to this MHC class II-restricted antigen presentation, are shown to play a pivotal role in the clearance of the infection, as will be discussed in Section 6.2. in more detail.",

The advantages oered by molecular biology in vaccine development against parasites are manifold and include: (i) the theoretical possibility to have access to the entire antigenic repertoire of an organism through its genes, overcoming the limitations and constraints of biochemical approaches, hampered by the relative abundance and accessibility of any given parasite molecule; (ii) the availability of prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems for the production at reasonable costs of large amounts of recombinant antigen devoid of toxic contaminants; (iii) the direct use of genes as DNA vaccines, and (iv) the possibility to engineer the cloned gene to enhance the immunogenicity of the encoded vaccine target. The success of a molecular approach to the development of a vaccine requires an adequate knowledge of the molecular biology of the organism under study. Proper molecular biology research on C. parvum started relatively late, in the early '90s. During this decade the number of DNA sequences deposited in the databases rose from about 40, in 1995, to the current 4000. This dramatic increase, re\u00afecting a general growing interest for this apicomplexan parasite, was mainly due to recently started genome projects which are based on partial sequencing of randomly selected genomic DNA (GST and STS projects) or cDNA (EST projects) clones (more information on the world wide web http://mercury.ebi.ac.uk/parasites/cparv.html).",

However, despite the considerable amount of novel genetic information provided by these random strategies, the number of C. parvum genes/proteins that have been so far characterised extensively, and can therefore be evaluated as potential vaccine targets, is very limited ( Table 1) . These genes, which were cloned in dierent laboratories adopting various molecular approaches, include: (i) cytoskeletal components; (ii) nuclear proteins; (iii) enzymes; (iv) factors involved in RNA translation; (v) heat shock proteins; (vi) an oocyst wall constituent; as well as (vii) surface and micronemal antigens of sporozoites. Proteins belonging to the latter class seem to represent, at the present state of knowledge, the best candidates for the development of a vaccine against cryptosporidiosis. This statement takes into account: (i) the peculiarity of their aa sequences, as opposed to other cloned C. parvum molecules sharing high homology with host counterparts; (ii) their presence in extracellular parasite stages, implying a higher susceptibility to the humoral immune response; and (iii) their putative involvement in key functions for parasite establishment within the host.",

Five were localised to either the sporozoite surface, CP15/60 [62, 63] , CP15 [64] and P23 [65, 66] , or to the micronemes, the thrombospondin-related adhesive protein of Cryptosporidium-1 (TRAP-C1) [67] and GP900 [68] , while the precise location of the sporozoite cysteine-rich protein (SCRP) (Spano et al., unpublished) is presently under study. CP15/60, CP15 and P23 are low mol. wt. polypeptides of 148, 119 and 111 aa, respectively, whose genes were cloned by screening C. parvum expression libraries with mAb or polyclonal antibodies raised against oocyst/sporozoite lysates [63, 64, 66, 69] . Despite the lack of a putative leader peptide for extracellular targeting and of transmembrane or GPI-anchoring signals in the aa sequence of CP15/60, CP15 and P23, immuno\u00afuorescence analyses suggested that these three proteins are located on the membrane of sporozoites, and in the case of CP15/60 and P23 on the membrane of merozoites [62, 65] . Subcellular fractionation shows that P23 can be found in the micronemes of C. parvum sporozoites (Petry et al., unpublished) . This evidence is corroborated by the observation that CP15 and P23 are shed from the surface of sporozoites during gliding motility [65, 70] . The subcellular localisation of CP15/60, CP15 and P23 would point to these antigens as possible vaccine candidates. CP15/60, CP15 and P23 are the only surface antigens of C. parvum sporozoites cloned to date. However, previous electrophoretic analysis of radioiodinated sporozoites showed that the plasmamembrane of this parasite stage displays about 20 dierent proteins [71] . This antigenic complexity could be exploited in future searches for novel vaccine targets.",

            "text": "Recent \u00aendings on host cell invasion by the zoites of the Apicomplexa shed new light on the functional role, and possibly the immunological potential, of parasite proteins located in the micronemes. These apical organelles are known to play a crucial role in the early steps of invasion, when their content is released at the interface between the zoite and the host cell, leading to speci\u00aec interactions between micronemal proteins and surface receptors of the host [72, 73] . Due to their involvement in a process of pivotal importance for the establishment of the infection and to their transitory display on the parasite surface upon interaction with the host cell, micronemal proteins are being intensely studied as vaccine candidates, especially in Plasmodium falciparum. Two C. parvum proteins showing distinct molecular architectures, but sharing the localisation in the micronemes, have been cloned so far, GP900 [74] and TRAP-C1 [67] . The \u00aerst is a highly glycosylated molecule with a polypep- tidic backbone of approximately 190 kDa, possessing a putative transmembrane region (TMR), two mucin-like domains, distinct cysteine-and threonine-rich motifs, as well as short aa repeats [74] . The protein, localised in the micronemes of sporozoites and merozoites by immunoEM, was also found by immuno\u00afuorescence to be exposed on the sporozoite surface and to be shed during gliding motility. Furthermore, antibodies directed against dierent domains of GP900 were shown to inhibit sporozoite invasion in vitro, claiming for a direct role of the molecule in host\u00b1parasite interaction [74] . The second micronemal protein, TRAP-C1, was recently cloned adopting a PCR-based approach for the identi\u00aecation of C. parvum DNA sequences encoding the type I repeat of the human protein thrombospondin (TSP) [67] . The TSP type I repeat is an adhesive aa motif which confers to proteins the ability to bind to sulphated sugars. Before TRAP-C1 cloning, molecules possessing the TSP type I repeat had been described, among protozoans, exclusively in apicomplexan parasites of the genera Plasmodium, Toxoplasma and Eimeria. TRAP-C1 is a 687 aa long polypeptide showing: (i) a leader peptide; (ii) six TSP type I repeats; (iii) a TMS; and (iv) a short cytoplasmic domain. These structural features, along with localisation in the micronemes of sporozoites, are shared by the TSP-related proteins TRAP of Plasmodium spp. [75] , MIC2 of T. gondii [76] and Etp100 of E. tenella [77] . The reported involvement of these TRAP-C1 homologues in substrate-dependent locomotion of sporozoites [78] , as well as in host cell attachment and invasion [79] , suggest that TRAP-C1 should be considered a promising vaccine candidate against cryptosporidiosis. Another C. parvum molecule deserving consideration from the point of view of vaccine development is the above mentioned SCRP, which is encoded by a single copy gene expressed at very high levels in C. parvum sporozoites (Spano et al., unpublished) . The recent cloning of a partial cDNA predicts that SCRP is a transmembrane protein possessing one epidermal-growth factor (EGF)like domain and three copies of the TSP type I repeat (Spano et al., unpublished) . Overall, these structural features suggest that this novel member of the TSP family is most likely involved in the interaction with host ligands.",

Despite the great number of reports describing the reactivity of mAb with oocyst wall constituents, only one C. parvum oocyst wall protein is known. The Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) was one of the \u00aerst C. parvum proteins identi\u00aeed by molecular techniques, screening a genomic expression library with an antiserum raised against an oocyst homogenate [81] . This abundant protein of 190 kDa is 1622 aa long, has a typical leader peptide and consists of two aa domains, characterised by distinct but related cystine-rich repeats. ImmunoEM studies showed that COWP is accumulated in the wall-forming bodies of mature macrogametes and eventually incorporated in the inner layer of the oocyst wall [82] . The immunological relevance of COWP in natural infections is not well understood; however, the presence of the protein on the inner oocyst wall seems to preclude, or at least discourage, its use as a vaccine target.",

Firstly, antibodies can act luminally by blocking the parasite's interactions with the host cell and by preventing attachment and/or invasion. This kind of action could greatly be facilitated by eector mechanisms (e.g. complement activation/lysis or opsonophagocytosis, binding to Fc receptors/antibodydependent cell mediated cytotoxicity) and thus potentially attack all extracellular stages, also the non-invasive ones (outlined in [58] ). Secondly, Crabb [58] suggested Cryptosporidium speci\u00aec antibodies might act also intracellularly, according to a novel mechanism recently described in rotavirus infections, where secretory IgA inhibited intracellular virus assembly during transcytosis through the infected epithelial cells [91] . In both mechanisms secretory IgA may represent the most promising Ig isotype, because it has the capacity of transcytosis and in the dimeric form with the secretory component, it is reasonably stable in the environment of the intestinal lumen. Favennec et al. [92] have shown that in AIDS patients with cryptosporidiosis, serum and faecal IgA response were mainly IgA1, a subclass that is primarily generated against polypeptide and glycoproteins, whereas the IgA2 subclass, responding to polysaccharide antigens, was underrepresented.",

A recent study compared the antigenicity of two dierent recombinant forms of CP15/60, one produced in a prokaryotic expression system and the other in a eukaryotic one. The most potent immune response was obtained using the eukaryotic form, possibly due to post-translational modi\u00aecations [96] . Western blot analyses of Cryptosporidium proteins using serum/faecal antibodies from Cryptosporidium-infected humans, BALB/c mice, rabbits, lambs, calves, piglets, goat kids and horses, all revealed a 23 kDa immunoreactive polypeptide [87, 93\u00b195] .

Protective immune response to cryptosporidial infection is associated with the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-g) by parasite-speci\u00aec CD4 + T-cells typically associated with a T helper 1 response [103] . Natural killer cells as a second source of IFN-g were postulated in SCID mice that show an initial resistance due to the action of an innate defence eector system [104\u00b1106] . Despite the increasing knowledge on the immunology of the parasite\u00b1 host interaction, the eector mechanisms that lead to sterilising immunity are not known. McDonald and Bancroft [105] discussed how IFN-g may increase the turnover of the parasitised epithelium which would lead to an acceleration of shedding of these cells from the villi. A second mode of action, involving the IFN-ginduced killing of Cryptosporidium has yet to be demonstrated. Even less is known about the involvement of other cells and cytokines in parasite killing.",

This so-called hyperimmune colostrum contained high titres of speci\u00aec antibodies. Jenkins et al. [115] reported that ewes immunised by DNA technology with a plasmid encoding the CP15/60 protein, mounted an IgG humoral response in both serum and colostrum. Animals responded to plasmids either after i.m. injection or intramammary immunisation of the ewes, but only with high doses (0.5\u00b11.0 mg) of plasmid DNA. Sagodira et al.

Intestinal IgA were detected for up to 1 year after immunisation, suggesting that this route of vaccination could induce a longterm response. A durable cellular response was also found, as mesenteric lymph node cells were still proliferating in response to C. parvum extract more than 1 year after immunisation. However, none of the two latter studies were designed to determine whether the acquired immune response provided protection against Cryptosporidium infection of the dams or their progeny.",

They found that, following challenge infection, none of the immune colostrum-treated calves developed diarrhoea and that the animals shed signi\u00aecantly fewer oocysts. Sagodira et al.

The mean duration of oocyst excretion was shorter (5.5 days) in kids born to vaccinated goats than in kids born to control goats (9.4 days). Monitoring of the daily mean weight con\u00aermed that kids born to vaccinated dams were not severely aected by the parasite development. Analysis of the immune response of dams following immunisation revealed that nasal vaccination with the CP15-DNA induced speci\u00aec IgG and IgA in both serum and colostrum. While the proliferative response of spleen cells was dierent in protected and unprotected kids, the precise mechanism by which this vaccine reduced diarrhoea and oocyst development remained unclear. In addition to the transfer of antibodies and immune cells by colostrum administration, the authors questioned whether DNA immunisation could have sensitised kids in utero to mount cellmediated and humoral immune responses [118] .",

In the \u00aerst instance a vaccinal strategy might greatly contribute to reduction of a public health threat which cannot be controlled by preventive measures. In the case of farm animals the development of a vaccine would be justi\u00aeed by the economic losses due to cryptosporidiosis in livestock husbandry, especially in neonatal ruminant breeding, and the limited availability of eective drugs. The acquisition of vaccinal immunity by active immunisation is presumably more problematic in newborn calves, lambs and kids, than it is in children. Indeed, since Cryptosporidium infection manifests itself so early in the life of these farm animals, it remains questionable whether an active vaccination is capable of mediating any signi\u00aecant immune protection in time. In addition, the blocking eect of circulating maternal antibodies on the vaccinal antigens, impose a very conscientious selection of the antigens to be administered and of the route of vaccination, when choosing for active immunisation. Passive vaccination, where dams are immunised to protect their progeny by colostral transfer, provides an interesting alternative.

In the study of parasite-derived antigens the molecular approach has oered various advantages when compared with the biochemical ones.
