Using reverse genetics technology, such negative-strand RNA viruses can now be rescued from cloned DNA. This technology allows the insertion of exogenous genes encoding foreign antigens into the MV genome in such a way that they can be expressed by the MV vaccine strain, without affecting virus structure, propagation and cell targeting. Recombinant viruses rescued from cloned cDNA induce immune responses against both measles virus and the cloned antigens. The tolerability of MV to gene(s) insertion makes it an attractive flexible vector system, especially if broad immune responses are required. The fact that measles replication strictly occurs in the cytoplasm of infected cells without DNA intermediate has important biosafety implications and adds to the attractiveness of MV as a vector. In this article we report the characteristics of reporter gene expression (GFP, LacZ and CAT) and the biochemical, biophysical and immunological properties of recombinant MV expressing heterologous antigens of simian immunogeficiency virus (SIV).",

Therefore, the establishment of potent antigen delivery systems became essential for the progress in this field. The use of live attenuated viral vectors appears promising especially since multiple antigens can efficiently be presented to the immune system. Attenuated measles virus (MV) vaccine represents a number of essential features for the development of candidate prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines. Among these features are safety, immunogenicity and cost effectiveness of the recombinant vaccines.",

In 1954, Enders and Peebles inoculated primary human kidney cells with the blood of David Edmonston, a child with measles [7] , and the resulting Edmonston strain of MV was subsequently adapted to growth in a variety of cell lines. Adaptation to chicken embryos, chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF), and/or dog kidney cells and human diploid cells produced the attenuated Edmonston A and B, Zagreb (EZ) and AIK-C seeds [12, 13, 25] . Edmonston-B was licensed in 1963 as the first MV vaccine. However, being reactogenic it was abandoned in 1975. Further passages of Edmonston A and B on CEF produced the more attenuated Moraten vaccines [26] .",

            "text": "Today, the Schwarz/Moraten, AIK-C and EZ vaccines are commonly used. MV vaccines induces a life-long immunity after a single or two low-dose injections [12, 13] . Persistence of antibodies and CD8 cells has been shown for as long as 25 years after vaccination [22] . MV vaccines are easily produced on a large scale in most countries and can be distributed at low cost. Because the attenuation of MV genome results from an advantageous combination of numerous mutations, the vaccine is very stable and reversion to pathogenicity has never been observed [13] . Regarding safety, MV replicates exclusively in the cytoplasm, ruling out the possibility of integration into host DNA. These characteristics make live attenuated MV vaccine an attractive candidate for use as a multivalent vaccination vector. A reverse genetics system for MV was established allowing the rescue of infectious MV from cloned cDNA [24] . Additional MV-specifc transcription units containing multiple cloning sites were introduced into the MV antigenome (i.e. cDNA sequence) allowing the addition and simultaneous expression of several exogenous genes. Genes from Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Simian or Human Immunodeficiency viruses (SIV, HIV), Mumps virus (MV), West Nile virus (WNV) and human IL12 were inserted and expressed from different loci of the MV genome [3, 5, 6, 16, 21, 23, [27] [28] [29] 31] .",

The plates were consecutively incubated with various dilutions of mouse sera (starting at 1:100, followed by serial two-fold dilutions), peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (074-1802 KLP) and with OPD substrate (o-Phenylendiamin, Fluka). Optical density values were measured at 492 nm. Values above the cut-off background level (mean value of sera from MV immunized mice multiplied by a factor of 2.1) were considered positive.

Multiple insertions, and simultaneous expression of multiple genes appeared challenging. Fig. 2A shows that three reporter genes of GFP, LacZ and CAT are actively expressed by a single MV construct. The total size of inserted genetic material, around 30% of MV-genome, did not restrict virus assembly or gene expression. Since reporter genes are cytosolically expressed, it is possible that their expression may not be hampered by virus assembly and growth that usually takes place at the cell surface. We therefore, determined the efficacy of expression of heterologous antigens of SIV env (a transmemberane protein) and gag (a cytosolic protein). Fig. 2B indicates the expression of both env (green) and gag (red) in the same syncytia. The stability of expression was determined after 10 passages on Vero cells demonstrating the stability of protein expression of single transgene (pol), previously reported and used here as a control, or double transgenes (env and gag) (Fig. 2C) . These results support the use of MV as a vector for expression of single or multiple genes. ",

To determine the protein contents of each fraction, gradient fractions were analyzed by Western blots and probed with monoclonal anti-gp120 (for SIV-env) and a mixture of monoclonal antibodies to MV P, and M and, in a separate experiment, using a monoclonal anti-MV-H antibody (for MV). In addition, infectivity of the gradient fractions and density were determined (Fig. 3) . The MV infectious particles were detectable in fractions 10-15 of both gradients. Subsequently, MV P, M, components of the infectious particle were also detected in these fractions (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (Fig. 3A) . Some SIV-env protein was detectable in the top fractions of the gradient (Fig. 3A, fractions 2-7) , likely due to membrane associated env that was not clarified by centrifugation.

Viruses were immunolabeled with an indirect reaction employing anti-MV-H monoclonal antibody cl5, or monoclonal anti-SIV-env antibody (gp120) followed by protein A coated with 6 nm or 10 nm colloidal gold. The anti-H antibody was reactive to the envelope of the large pleomorphic MV virions (Fig. 3C ) which show typical electron-dense RNP structures accumulated inside the H-containing envelope. In contrast, anti-SIV antibody did not localize to on the surface of recombinant MV particles. Few gold particals were sporadically observed away of the virus (Fig. 3C) . Interestingly, VLPs were observed only in the preparation of recombinant MV expressing both SIV-env and gag (MV2,3env,gag-SIV) (Fig. 3C) while no VLPs were observed in recombinants expressing SIV-env alone (not shown). The diameter of these round-shape structures varried from 50-100 nm were lightly coated with anti-SIVgp120-colloidal gold particles suggesting that SIV env is likely present on these particles. Since this phenomenon is only occuring upon coexpression of SIV-env and gag, we conclude that the presence of VLPs in this preparation is due to env-gag association.

MV specific antibody responses induced by the standard MV vaccine or rMV-SIV were comparable up to 50 weeks post immunization (Fig. 4C) . UV inactivated MV induced only marginal levels of antibody titers fading away very quickly, indicating that replication of MV or rMV is necessary to induce high and persisting immune reponses. For the three rMV-SIV vectors the initial induction of IgGs against SIV-env protein appeared very different at 8-20 weeks post immunization, but the antibody levels reached rather similar end points at 50-week post immunization (Fig. 4D ). While very high early (8 weeks) anti-env antibody titers were induced by the double recombinant MV2,3env,gag-SIV, recombinant MV expressing env from position 3, MV3env-SIV, appeared to elicit the lowest initial anti-SIV-env antibody titer at week 8 post immunization. This is remarkable in view of the fact that the double recombinant grew to slightly lower titers than the other two recombinants (Fig. 4B) . We observed that anti-SIV-env antibody titers remained rather high, declining only slowly after 20 weeks, similar to anti-MV antibodies. Therefore, the longevity of humoral immune response against foreign antigens appear to follow kinetics similar to those observed for the MV specific antibody response (Fig. 4D ).",

Whereas this value was established for reporter genes, insertions of similar size encoding SIV antigens was also successfully achieved. Although the genetically heavily loaded viruses propagated slightly slower than standard MV, the resulting end viral titers were similar. Even more gratifying was the observation that after 10 serial passages, with a total amplification of around 10 20 -fold, the high genetic stability of rMVs ensured expression of different genes, including pathogens derived heterologous genes [30] . While large inserts may be tolerated mainly in view of the little constraint on genome size for such a pleomorphic virus, with a helical nucleocapsid, we believe that the stability of gene expression is likely due to other factors. The tight RNP structure, the adherence of MV-genome to the rule of six defined by Calain and Roux [2] and the very slow elongation rate of RNA during replication may allow internal proof-reading control by the viral polymerase.",

Indeed, regulatory hurdle may arise if essential biological properties of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are modified or completely changed. This also applies to recombinant MV. Importantly, the maintained fuctionality and targeting of the recombinant vaccine virus, i.e. its in vivo tropism, should be maintained [19] . We analyzed the incorporation of foreign transmembrane protein (SIV-env) into the cell-free recombinant MV, biochemically and by immunoelectron microscopy and could demonstrated that SIV env was excluded from the envelope of MV. Therefore, the induction of immune responses towards SIV-env is due to the in vivo expression of the transgene during replication of recombinant MV in target cells of the experimental animals (reported here). In fact, the results presented here demonstrate for the first time the replication of recombinant MVs in transgenic mice.",

Interestingly, since MV efficiently infects professional antigen presenting cells, macrophages and particularly dendritic cells [8] , MV-based vectors deliver their foreign cargo directly to the most efficient antigen presenting cells. Therefore, the wide experience with MV as a measles vaccine favours the use of MV vector as a model for the development of novel multivalent vaccines, including HIV. MV and HIV have several properties in common, since they both infect monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells [8, 14] . In this respect, an MV vector that targets the HIV proteins in the same compartment as HIV itself may provide advantages over alternative vector systems, particularly in the induction of \"danger signals\" [17] . In addition, replicating live attenuated MV has the advantageous capacity to induce long-lasting immunity [13] . We also demonstrated here that recombinant MVs, expressing SIV antigens, induced significantly high and long-lived antibody responses against both MV and SIV-env antigen. Therefore, with its capacity to induce a strong and long lasting protective immunity, the liveattenuated MV expressing the appropriate HIV genes could potentially serve as a pediatric vaccine protecting simultaneously against measles and AIDS. The immunogenicity induced by our system is likely due to (i) quantitative levels of expression and presentation of the antigens in cells infected by live recombinant MV and, (ii) the proper and efficient presentation to the immune system.",

Indeed, the presence of anti-MV immunity in nearly the entire adult human population would seem to restrict the use of MV recombinants to infants, an already worthy goal in any event. However, large vaccination studies showed that re-vaccinating already immunized individuals results in a boost of anti-MV antibodies, suggesting that the attenuated live vaccine replicated and expressed its proteins in spite of pre-existing immunity [4] . Studies of cell-mediated immunity in infants given measles vaccine during the first year of life show that the presence of maternal anti-measles antibodies does not preclude the induction of anti-measles cellular responses and that responses can be very efficiently boosted [10, 11] . Under such circumstances one might hope to be able to vaccinate adults against a foreign antigen with rMV. Indeed, this has been demonstrated earlier, in preclinical models, by Lorin et al. [16] , and results from our laboratory (Liniger et al., not published). However, it remains to be seen whether MV vectors can induce immunity to carrier proteins in already immunized individuals and to evaluate the safety of MV vectors in phase I and II clinical studies. Such trials will aim at: (i) defining the appropriate dose of rMV and (ii) demonstrating an acceptable reactogenicity profile of recombinant viruses and at confirming the absence of in vivo virus shedding from vaccinees.",

(A) Expression of GFP, LacZ and CAT by a single recombinant virus. Vero cells were infected with recombinant MV and syncytia were visualized by UV for GFP, and light microscopy for LacZ and CAT after beta-gal and CAT assays. (B) Co-expression of SIV env and gag simultaneously by recombinant MV. Indirect immunofluorescence assays performed on single syncytia of cells infected recombinant MV expressing SIV env and gag. Monoclonal anti-SIV gp120 coupled to FITC and polyclonal anti-gag antibody coupled to Cy3 visualized the localization of env and gag by confocal microscopy. (C) Stability of transgene (s) expression by recombinant MV. Vero cells were infected with recombinant MVs expressing either pol or both env and gag genes. Shed virions were passaged 10 time (see Section 2). Virions of passages 1 and 10 were used to infect equal Vero cells cultures at an MOI of 0.1. Appearance of syncytia was monitored by microscopy. After 36-48 h p.i. cells were lysed and equal amounts of lysates were analyzed by SAS-PAGE and immunoblots using polyclonal anti-SIV antibody. Standard MV was used as a negative control.",

The SIV env protein was detected using monoclonal anti-SIV-gp120 antibodies. MV proteins were identified using monoclonal anti N and M antibodies (A) and anti-H (B). (A) The localization of SIV env and MV-structural proteins, respectively, is shown for the same gradient fraction. (B) The localization of SIV env and gag after co-expression by a single recombinant was compared to the localization of MV H. A shift in the density of the SIV env upon concommitant expression of gag from the double recombinant MV. (C) Immunoelectron microscopic visualization of the double recombinant MV (expressing env and gag simultaneously). Cell free viruses were pelletted over a 20% sucrose cushion and fixed and stained on EM grids and further treated with specific antibodies.

(A, B) Kinetics of the in vivo replication of MV (A) and the magnitude of replication of recombinant MVs was compared to that of the standard MV (B). The kinetics of replication was determined by TaqMan (see Section 2). (A) Mice were first immunized with 10 4 PFU of standard MV. Every 2 days, the number of MV-N copies were determined from spleens of two mice. (B) Mice were immunized i.p. with equal MOI of standard MV or recombinant MVs. Spleens were collected 5 days post immunization and total RNA was purified and the number of MV-N copies per g RNA was determined (see Section 2). (C, D) Induction of humoral immune responses by MV and recombinant MVs against MV and SIV env. The induction of anti-MV antibodies in CD46 transgenic mice persisted up to 50 weeks post immunization. As shown in the different panels, MV and recombinant MV-SIVs induced comparable anti-MV IgG profiles, irrespective of the size of the gene insert.",
