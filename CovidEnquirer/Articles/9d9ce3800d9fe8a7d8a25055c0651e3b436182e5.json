There are two classes of reverse transcriptase inhibitors: nucleoside and nonnucleoside (NRTIs and NNRTIs, respectively). NRTIs are compounds that are incorporated in to the nascent DNA chain and block its elongation. NNRTIs bind directly to the enzyme itself, inhibit its function, and may lead to its degradation.

The initial step in HIV cellular entry is binding of the viral gp120 to the cellular coreceptor (see Chapter 9, HIV/AIDS). HIV gp41 then undergoes a conformational change that exposes its N-terminal fusion domain, which inserts into the plasma membrane of the host cell. Close to the N terminus of gp41 is a heptad repeat (HR1) that forms a three-helix bundle. HR1 associates with another three-helix bundle (HR2) at the C terminus of gp41, which forces the molecule into a hairpin The various scientific strategies for development of antiviral drugs.

(Lazzarin et al., 2003) . Viral mutagens. The survival of viruses depends in part on their ability to evolve in response to antiviral pressures, such as host immune responses. From this perspective, the rapid mutational rate of RNA viruses, in particular, facilitates the selection of fitness mutants among an everpresent swarm of genetic variants. In theory, the polymerases of RNA viruses have evolved to an optimal balance of processivity and fidelity (mutational rate), which permits the generation of large numbers of progeny with many genetic variants. These variants facilitate rapid adaptation to selective pressures, such as immune responses and drug treatment. A counterintuitive approach to antiviral drugs is the use of mutagens that can increase viral mutational rate, so that fit variants are overwhelmed by less fit or nonsense mutants leading to a lethal accumulation of errors or \"error catastrophe\" (discussed in Chapter 17, Virus Evolution). At least one antiviral drug, ribavirin, a nucleoside analogue, has been proposed to act through this mechanism. It has been shown to both increase mutation rate and decrease the production of infectious particles in several viruses including poliovirus and Hantaan virus.",

Some individuals are homozygous for a mutation in CCR5 (the \"delta 32\" mutation) that prevents the expression of this host gene. These persons do not show any ill effect from this mutation and are very resistant to HIV infection.

Viruses that have a very short incubation period and generation time, and spread very rapidly, tend to be poor candidates for antiviral treatment because it is difficult to complete diagnosis and initiate therapy in a timely fashion. Influenza is a good example of a serious illness with a short incubation period (18-72 h). Neuraminidase inhibitors are quite effective antiinfluenza drugs but need to be given prior to infection or very soon after symptoms appear. This drawback may be overcome under certain circumstances; in the presence of a pandemic wave of influenza that is spreading across a community, antiviral drugs could be widely administered as a short-term prophylactic, thereby anticipating potential infection. Persistent viral infections that cause significant chronic illness are attractive targets for antiviral treatment. Their slow course permits an accurate diagnosis and evaluation prior to initiating therapy. Furthermore, there are a few persistent infections, such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C, which carry a long-term risk of liver failure or hepatocellular cancer. With an estimated >150 million cases of hepatitis C and >350 million cases of hepatitis B globally, these diseases constitute significant opportunities for treatment. Effective therapeutic intervention, particularly long-lasting viral suppression or even viral clearance (a \"cure\"), would significantly reduce the disease burden.",

Following transmission by mosquito bite, WNV initiates a plasma viremia followed by invasion of the central nervous system, resulting in potentially fatal encephalitis. Experiments in immunologically deficient mice have shown that both antibody and cellular immunity play a role in the outcome of infection. Surprisingly, antibody also plays a role in the clearance of virus from the central nervous system, even when infection has been well established in neurons. When administered to mice undergoing acute WNV encephalitis, passive antibody can markedly improve survival, at least under experimental conditions.

IFNs induce a complex pleiotropic response that inhibits viral replication in several different ways, in addition to activating antigen-specific adaptive immune responses.

However, IFN therapy has substantial unwanted side effects in humans, which limit its practical utilization. Cytokine storm. Several serious viral infections of humans produce disease via an excessive or imbalanced host response, leading to intense dysregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This cytokine storm can cause a range of serious disease manifestations. These include acute lung injury in association with respiratory viruses such as highly pathogenic influenza viruses (avian H5N1 and 1918 H1N1) and SARS, or a shock syndrome in fatal cases of Ebola virus infection. Recent studies of the host-virus interactome (see Chapter 12, The Virus-Host Interactome) have made it possible to identify some of the components of this pathological host response. Such insights may be useful in formulating new therapies to ameliorate an excessive deleterious innate response.",

RNA viruses have a mutation rate estimated at 10 \u22124 (1 mutation in 10,000 base replications) that is much higher than the rate for DNA viruses (10 \u22128 ); the difference reflects poor fidelity, as well as the absence of cellular proofreading mechanisms for RNA polymerases. 2. The replication rate of the virus during a specific infection will vary widely and influence the rate at which mutant virions are produced. For instance, it has been estimated that during an HIV-1 infection, 10 8 -10 11 virions are produced daily; this would yield 10 4 -10 7 virions with single point mutations (or an average 1-1000 mutants for each of the 10,000 bases) each day. At the other end of the scale, human papillomavirus (HPV, a DNA virus) replicates very slowly in vivo, so that very few mutant virions would be synthesized daily. These differences are reflected in the observation that individual primary HIV isolates consist of a \"swarm\" of viruses the sequences of which-after several years of infection-vary from 5% to 10%, for different genes. In contrast, primary isolates of DNA viruses show much less variation. 3. Different classes of drugs target diverse viral functions that vary in their importance for viral replication, and individual drugs vary in the degree to which they can block their targeted function. Furthermore, resistant mutants vary in their ability to replicate in the presence of the drug and also-absent drug-in their replicative capacity or fitness. These nuances are reflected in the observation that different HIV-1 NRTIs-which are directed against the same viral function-select for different escape mutations. 4. The in vivo selective pressure of a specific drug will depend upon both its intrinsic ability to block an essential virus function and its pharmacodynamics, which will determine its actual concentration at sites of viral replication. As the selective pressure increases, the relative advantages of mutants increase, but the rate of replication of wild-type virus decreases. As replication diminishes, the probability that resistant viruses will emerge diminishes. The selection of escape mutants is maximized when the drug concentration is high enough to select for resistant mutants, but not so high that it substantially inhibits virus replication (see Chapter 17, Viral Evolution).",

Using a publically available database, Connectivity Map, which contains thousands of gene expression profiles from over a thousand compounds, several drugs were identified as potential antivirals against the H7N9 virus. These included cellular kinase inhibitors as well as some FDA-approved drugs, such as troglitazone and minocycline.

As a result, there is a panoply of FDA-approved products ( Table 2 ). The action of these drugs has been described in the foregoing section on antiviral compounds. The ability to effectively treat this inevitably fatal infection is one of the great triumphs of scientific medicine. It is now guesstimated that a subject age 20 who is recently infected with HIV and is on optimal HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) has a life expectancy of 50 years (contrasted with 5 years absent treatment). However, present regimens that control HIV replication do not provide a \"cure\" since they fail to eradicate latent HIV genomes (see Chapter 9, HIV/AIDS).",

The pathogenesis of different infections will have an important role in the selection and efficacy of such putative drugs. There is great potential for drugs to treat persistent infections with serious long-term consequences, while drugs may be less practical for acute infections that resolve before a virus-specific diagnosis can be made. The molecular nature of the virus-host infection is important, since it can determine whether drugs that control an infection will also lead to a permanent cure. A comparison of HIV (control no cure) and HCV (control and cure) illustrates that point. What will guide the search for effective antiviral compounds? The recent successes for HCV and HIV suggest that direct-acting antiviral molecules still remain the gold standard that will inform many initiatives. One Achilles heel of such compounds is viral escape, but extensive experience with HIV has shown that the use of triple combinations can overcome this problem. Recent experience with HCV has provided several lessons: understanding the virus replication cycle at a molecular level paves the way for identification of candidate compounds; these insights can be used to construct high-throughput screening assays; and this strategy can lead to products that are clinically effective and safe (Scheel and Rice, 2013; Kim et al., 2013; Rice and Saeed, 2014) .",
