            "text": "Acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (ANPs) constitute a distinguished class of antiviral agents. 1 They also exhibit important cytostatic, 2 antiparasitic 3 and immunomodulatory activities. 4 The main advantages of ANPs are their resistance towards degradation by enzymes in vivo, and the ability to by-pass the first phosphorylation step necessary for the activation of the bioactive nucleosides. 5 Three ANPs have been approved worldwide for clinical use: 5 HPMPC (cidofovir, Vistide \u00d2 ) for the treatment of CMV retinitis in AIDS patients, 5,6 PMEA (1, Fig. 1 ) (as its oral prodrug adefovir dipivoxil, Hepsera \u00d2 ) for the treatment of chronic HBV infections, 5 and PMPA (2, Fig. 1 ) (as its oral prodrug tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, Viread \u00d2 ) for the treatment of HIV (itself or in combination with other antivirals) and chronic HBV infections. 5 Many other ANPs were found to exhibit important antiviral properties, e.g., derivatives of 2,6-diaminopurine (HPMPDAP, PMEDAP, PMPDAP) 1f and 'open ring' derivatives of 2,4-diaminopyrimidine (HPMPOeD-APy, PMEOeDAPy, PMPOeDAPy). 1f,7 Like nucleotides, 8 due to their poor bioavailability, all ANPs have to be administered in the form of their prodrugs (or by injection in the case of cidofovir). 9 Analogues containing adenine play a special role among ANPs for their potent antiviral properties. HPMPA (3, Fig. 1 ), 1a the prototype of ANPs derived from (S)-DHPA (5), possesses broadspectrum activity against DNA viruses (including herpes-, adeno-, pox-and iridoviruses), as well as against retroviruses. While only the (S)-HPMP enantiomer 3 is active in the adenine series, its 3 0 -Ophosphonomethyl regioisomer (iso-HPMPA) 10 exhibits no antiviral activity. 1a The approved adenine analogues PMEA (1) and PMPA (2) are primarily active against hepadna-and retroviruses, while PMEA (1) also exhibits notable activity against herpesviruses. 5 Finally, FPMPA (4) , which proved to be less antivirally effective, but also less toxic than PMEA (1) , was thoroughly studied for its antiretroviral activity but was not pursued further to the clinical use. 11 A number of other adenine derivatives proved to have important antiviral activities. 1f Acyclic nucleoside analogues like (S)-DHPA (5, Fig. 1 ), marketed in Czechoslovakia as Duvira \u00d2 gel, 12 or structurally related D-eritadenine 13 and 3-(adenin-9-yl)-2-hydroxypropanoic acid (6, AHPA) 14 constitute another class of broad-spectrum antivirals. These acyclic analogues of adenosine are targeted at S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase, 15 and thus at the capping process (methylation of 5 0 -end-guanine of viral mRNA). 16 Herein we describe the synthesis and biological properties of the novel type of acyclic nucleoside phosphonates structurally related to all above-mentioned biologically important compounds. The novel type of ANPs is derived from 2-(phosphonomethoxy) propanoic acid, with the adenine derivative (S)-2 0 -carboxy-PMEA (7a, (S)-CPMEA, Fig. 1 ) being the most promising candidate with potential biological properties.",

Apparent incapability of the C-2 0 methyl group to substantially interact with the two polar amino acids of the HIV-1 RT led us to reason that replacement of the C-2 0 methyl with a polar group able to interact with Arg 72 and/or Gln 151 would increase the binding affinity of such an inhibitor to HIV-1 RT. Our docking studies indicated that replacement of the C-2 0 methyl group of tenofovir diphosphate (Fig. 2a) with a carboxyl group could, theoretically, lead to formation of up-to four new hydrogen bonds with arginine 72 and glutamine 151 (Fig. 2b) .",
