Recently, luteolin had been identified to be a good substrate of catechol-Omethyltransferase (COMT), and two methylated metabolites of luteolin, chrysoeriol (4\u2032, 5, 7-trihydroxy-3\u2032-methoxyflavone) and diosmetin (3\u2032, 5, 7-trihydroxy-4\u2032-methoxyflavone), were identified in the rat plasma after hydrolylsis treatment when intravenously given luteolin to rats [16] . Since these flavonoids occurred mainly as glucuronidated and sulfated forms in the blood circulation, and there was lack of standard compounds of these glucuronidated and sulfated flavonoids, the total forms (free, glucuronidated and sulfated) flavonoids were analyzed after a hydrolysis treatment in our previous study [21] . Chrysoeriol and diosmetin not only possessed many biological effects similar to luteolin, such as antioxidant, antiinflammatory, but also exhibited their own effects such as osteoporosis [17, 18] . Furthermore, chrysoeriol and diosmetin were natural prodrugs in cancer prevention which could be converted to luteolin by CYPs [19, 20] . Therefore it was crucial to study the pharmacokinetics of chrysoeriol and diosmetin when FCE were orally taken.",

To get a suitable mobile phase condition, the mixtures of 0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile, or 0.1% formic acid and methanol, and the three above were compared, the combination of the three components in the mobile phase was found to make a well separation. After optimizing the proportion of acetonitrile and methanol, a mobile phase of 0.1% formic acid, acetonitrile and methanol (60: 16:24 , v/v/v) was determined.

The present study directly evaluated the role of COMT in vivo in disposition of luteolin after oral dose of FCE to rats. However, the increase in concentrations of luteolin by COMT inhibition was limited, which could not reverse the pharmacokinetics differences between luteolin and apigenin. It was possible that the inhibition of COMT by entacapone was limited due to the very wide tissue distribution of COMT in vivo, and/or other metabolism enzymes, such as UGTs and SULTs, especially in the small intestinal could compete with COMT to decrease the contribution of COMT to disposition of luteolin. The concentrations of apigenin were also increased by entacapone, but the mechanism for this was unclear and needs further investigation.",

The pharmacokinetics of the two methylated luteolin in vivo could enlarge our knowledge about the disposition profile of the luteolin and pharmacological effects of FCE in vivo when oral administration of FCE.",
