Because backyard hens typically live longer, are usually provided an adequate diet, and have relatively more space than commercial hens, the most common causes of their reproductive disease include neoplasia, egg-related peritonitis, persistent right oviduct, and old age. Conversely, other reproductive diseases including vent trauma and depletion of calcium are rarely diagnosed.",

In response, veterinarians are seeking to increase their knowledge and level of care for backyard poultry. The veterinarian should first refer to one of the many general avian textbooks that are available to gain avian knowledge regarding general husbandry and care, handling, approach to medicine and surgery, evaluation of radiographs, and anatomy and physiology. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Most backyard poultry are initially maintained for their ability to lay eggs, consequently female reproductive problems are a common presenting complaint. The following is an overview of how to identify and treat some of the most commonly encountered female reproductive diseases of backyard poultry.",

The older term \"egg yolk peritonitis\" has fallen out of favor as birds have a coelom rather than a peritoneum, and the offending substance can be not just the yolk of the egg but other parts of the egg. It is common for chickens to have some degree of egg-related coelomitis, and mild cases are commonly encountered at necropsy in production hens. Generally, chickens tolerate mild peritonitis better than parrots. Causes usually involve retrograde movement of shelled or shell-less eggs from the oviduct back into the coelomic cavity because of oviductal bacterial infection, oviductal impaction, or abnormal confirmation of the oviduct. Heavy-production hens or those with inadequate calcium in their diet can have calcium depletion and uterine inertia leading to retrograde flow of egg material. Bacterial infections commonly involve Escherichia coli migrating up the oviduct from the vent.",

Lateral and ventrodorsal radiographic images taken with the patient under general anesthesia are recommended (Fig. 3 ). If the goal of radiographic imaging is simply to determine if an egg (or eggs) is present or not, then having the bird remain in a standing position for the procedure is adequate (Figs. 4 and 5). A lateral beam across the table is used for a standing lateral view. Fluid obtained for analysis by coelomocentesis may be helpful and can also be used for bacterial culture. Ultrasonograpy can be used to determine if the eggs are free within the coelomic cavity or positioned in the oviduct (Fig. 6) . A complete blood count and plasma chemistry profile, including total and ionized calcium, can be performed to determine the degree of infection or inflammation, amount of dehydration, liver or kidney disease, and/or calcium status.",

The difficult decision in mild cases of egg-related coelomitis is whether surgery will provide a better outcome than antibiotics and analgesic therapy alone. Generally, the more severe the egg-related coelomitis, the more likely the surgery will provide a better outcome than conservative measures, especially if eggs are free within the coelomic cavity. Some clients choose not to have surgery performed on their hens with mild to moderate egg-related coelomitis, and the hens may or may not respond to conservative therapy alone. Oviductal impaction should be resolved with surgery to remove the egg material before it adheres to the oviduct. Calcium supplementation is usually not required as eggrelated coelomitis is rarely due to hypocalcaemia and/or oviductal inertia in backyard hens, but it can be given as there is minimal to no adverse effects from giving one calcium injection.",

When separating the hen from other birds, the animal should not be isolated as this is stressful and not recommended. After one 4.7-mg deslorelin implant was placed subcutaneously in Japanese quail, it caused cessation of egg laying for approximately 70 days in 6 of 10 birds when compared with a placebo group. 6, 7 In a similar study, two 4.7-mg deslorelin implants or one 9.4-mg implant were placed subcutaneously in Japanese quail, causing significantly reduced egg production from week 1 to week 15 and week 12 to week 26 after implantation, respectively, when compared with the placebo group. 8 It is interesting to note that 3 quails in each treatment group continued to lay eggs throughout the study period. After administration of hormones, any eggs produced by treated hens should be discarded, and the owner must differentiate the treated hen's eggs from the untreated birds or figure out a way to separate her or her eggs from other birds (some even use a chicken diaper).",

            "text": "Thin-shelled, soft shelled, or shell-less eggs are usually produced owing to inadequate calcium supplementation. Laying hens should be on an optimum-laying ration. Layer diets have higher calcium and protein levels than maintenance formulations. If the layer ration comprises 90% of the total diet, then no supplemental calcium is required. Crushed oyster shell is routinely used for calcium supplementation for laying hens. In heavy-production, commercial laying operations, calcium depleted eggs are more common and often called \"caged layer fatigue.\" Birds diagnosed with \"caged layer fatigue\" will present with weight loss, weakness, hypocalcemia, and feather loss. Dystocia or egg impaction is likely in a hypocalcemic hen owing to oviductal inertia. The dysfunction of the oviduct, through inadequate muscle contraction, occurs because calcium is required for proper muscle contraction. Treatment of hypocalcaemia is to correct the bird's diet and administer intramuscular calcium gluconate at a dose of 30 mg/kg.",

Cloacal or uterine prolapse is more common in commercial heavy-production hens where crowded conditions and cannibalistic behavior is present, resulting in pecking of the vent by other hens. This condition is not diagnosed in backyard poultry but may occur in certain birds under specific circumstances (e.g., significant egg laying and nutritional deficiencies).",
