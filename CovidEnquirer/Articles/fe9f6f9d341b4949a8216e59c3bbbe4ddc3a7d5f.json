To compare usefulness of diagnostic tests and to understand reasons for the magnitude and severity of an outbreak, we used 3 diagnostic methods to test 720 samples from 680 patients returning to Europe from the Indian Ocean region in 2006. Chikungunya infection was confi rmed for 24.4% patients in the fi rst half of the year and for 9.9% in the second half. Reverse transcription-PCR was positive for all samples taken up to day 4 after symptom onset. Immunofl uorescence detected immunoglobulin (Ig) M on day 1 and IgG on day 2 for some patients, and in all patients from day 5 onward. Soon after onset of symptoms, patients had IgG and IgM and high viral loads (some >10 9 copies/mL plasma). These data will help healthcare providers select diagnostic tests for returning travelers.",

By October 2006 on R\u00e9union Island alone, which has a population of 760,000, at least 266,000 cases had been reported (3) . The epidemic swept eastward into the Indian subcontinent, where by the end of the year it had caused >1.3 million cases; attack rates were 45% in some regions (4, 5) . By the beginning of 2007, the epidemic was on the decline on La R\u00e9union and the Seychelles (6), but it seems to be continuing in areas of India.

Unfortunately, these data for CHIKV are minimal because studies on large patient cohorts were completed before relevant laboratory tests, particularly RT-PCR, became avail-able. More recent studies have used such methods, but the numbers of studied patients have been limited (14, 22, 23) . To provide support for the selection of diagnostic tests, we collected a cumulative fi gure of virologic parameters (viral RNA detection and antibody testing results over time) for the largest cohort of returning travelers studied to date. In addition, we sought possible reasons for the magnitude and severity of current outbreaks. Of relevance is a recent fi nding that Indian Ocean CHIKV strains display genetic characteristics in their structural E1 gene (22) , especially at amino acid position 226. Similar to the related Semliki Forest virus, in which a homologous mutation causes enhanced membrane fusion capacity in insect cells, the virus could have an advantage in insects or even in humans (22, 24) . We determined whether the mutation had an infl uence on viral loads in the patients in our cohort and how it was distributed geographically and temporally during 2006.",

For 189 patients, exact travel destinations were reported: Madagascar (n = 9), Mauritius (n = 92), the Seychelles (n = 23), R\u00e9union Island (n = 18), Bali (n = 2), Indonesia (n = 6), Sri Lanka (n = 5), India (n = 28), Malaysia (n = 2), Kenya (n = 1), and Thailand (n = 3). Average ages of travelers to each country did not differ signifi cantly (analysis of variance F-test, p>0.05). For 121 patients, exact dates of onset and sampling could be retrieved through voluntary questionnaires completed by telephone or fax after issuance of results. Age and sex distribution and travel histories for these patients are shown in Table 1 . The day of onset of symptoms was defi ned as day 0. All samples with possible CHIKV in 2006 were tested for IgG and IgM by indirect immunofl uorescence. During the fi rst half of 2006, all samples were tested by real-time RT-PCR in addition; however, in the second half of the year RT-PCR testing was restricted to samples from patients with acute infection only (on the basis of experiences from the fi rst 6 months as described below). Classifi cation of patients as having laboratory-confi rmed cases required either a positive RT-PCR or IgM result or an isolated IgG detection with at least a subsequent 4-fold increase in titer. The Statgraphics Plus 5.1 software package (Manugistics, Dresden, Germany) was used for all statistical analyses.",

They were present in all patients in whom acute infection was confi rmed after 5 days. IgG was present so early that additional testing for IgM provided only limited additional sensitivity for detecting acute cases. Most likely this fi nding was caused not by low sensitivity of our IgM assay but by an unusually early IgG response. One reason for early IgG fi ndings could be lack of specifi city of the applied immunofl uorescence assay. However, we have shown recently that indirect immunofl uorescence is a sensitive and specifi c method for determining antibodies against CHIKV (N. Litzba et al., unpub. data). Moreover, we have confi rmed specifi city of our immunofl uorescence assay results by retesting a subset of serum samples by plaque-reduction neutralization test (data not shown); all antibody-positive samples subjected to this test had positive results. Finally, because most patients resided in Germany, where alphaviruses are not endemic, preexisting antibodies are unlikely. We must therefore assume that the IgG results are technically valid. An explanation for early IgG production would be the presence of unusually high presymptomatic viremia that provided an early antigen stimulus for antibody formation.",

            "text": "Cell culture in our study was not particularly diagnostic. It was rather insensitive (23.4%) compared with RT-PCR, and the presence of antibody seemed to prevent isola- tion of virus. In successful cultures, cytopathic effects were not observed before 3-4 days of incubation, often requiring at least 1 passage, which made time for culture longer than time to seroconversion. Nevertheless, culture is essential for more specifi c investigation such as virus neutralization tests, as well as for ecologic and basic research. For clinical virus detection, RT-PCR seemed to be the method of choice. Our study provides 2 alternative real-time RT-PCR protocols that have analytical performance comparable to that of major diagnostic PCR systems (25, 26) ; each protocol has been clinically evaluated on our whole cohort. Apart from practical diagnostic implications, our fi ndings identify important questions for future research. As an example, courses of antibodies and viremia were different from those of dengue virus infections (27, 31) . Probably the most important difference was an early IgG response to CHIKV, compared with a clear delay of IgG (appearing after IgM) in most acute cases of primary dengue virus infection. For a substantial fraction of patients, dengue IgG is not detected until after 2 weeks of illness (27, 31) . One could speculate that the reason for this difference is the different tropism of each virus. Dengue virus infects predominantly monocytes (31) and thereby may induce a relevant, short-term immunosuppression (32) . CHIKV probably does not share this tropism (33) , although the primary target site of CHIKV infection is unclear. Whether co-infection with dengue and CHIKV would lead to altered symptoms is another question; 2 patients in our study had this co-infection. Their disease courses may be more severe or prolonged than those of most patients (17) , but detailed and controlled studies on more patients are needed.",

During their fi rst few days of illness, our patients had tremendous virus concentrations, sometimes >10 9 copies/mL of plasma. Such high viral loads are uncommon with other arboviral diseases (34) (35) (36) and would make CHIKV prone to nosocomial transmission, e.g., by needle-stick injury or mucous membrane exposure. Indeed such an event has already been documented (23) . Blood and other body fl uids of CHIKV patients should be considered infectious during the fi rst week of symptoms. We cannot determine from this study whether the potential infectivity of CHIKV may also become important in the context of transfusion, because we analyzed only symptomatic patients. However, virus concentrations in our patients were already decreasing when symptoms were detected, and therefore a high viremia in presymptomatic patients seems likely. None of our patients had antibodies on day 0, and presymptomatic patients would therefore be highly infectious. The issue of transfusion transmissibility of CHIKV deserves intensive investigation. Targeted interventions like on R\u00e9union Island, where blood donation was suspended during the epidemic and blood was imported from France (37), are not an option in India or Southeast Asia.",

            "text": "Why such a large epidemic of CHIKV infections could occur and why courses of disease were so unusually severe are unclear. A previous study recognized an A226V exchange in the E1 envelope glycoprotein for the fi rst time in CHIKV and found it to increase over time in isolates from R\u00e9union Island (22) . In the related Semliki Forest virus, a corresponding mutation conferred a replication advantage in cholesterol-depleted insect cells (24) , which for the virus would implicate an advantage in its reservoir. In addition to the above fi ndings of Schuffenecker et al, we could confi rm presence of the mutation on Mauritius, where a larger part of our patients had visited. However, viruses isolated in the late phase of our study (September to December 2006) from patients returning from India and Sri Lanka, respectively, did not show the mutation but were otherwise clearly related to the Indian Ocean strain. The signifi cance of the mutation thus remains uncertain, and functional studies are needed. Confi rmation of this or other genetic connections would provide another example of minor genetic differences that account for major changes of an arthropod virus. After the past and ongoing experiences with agents such as the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian infl uenza viruses, the CHIKV epidemic provides more proof of the importance of research into the ecology of emerging and reemerging diseases. Dr Panning is a physician and medical virologist specializing in emerging viruses. His research focuses on the development of molecular diagnostic assays for patient care and virus ecology studies.",
