A drugscreening assay that scores for virus-induced cytopathic effects on cultured cells was used. Tested were 19 clinically approved compounds from several major antiviral pharmacologic classes: nucleoside analogs, interferons, protease inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and neuraminidase inhibitors. Complete inhibition of cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV in culture was observed for interferon subtypes, \u03b2-1b, \u03b1-n1, \u03b1-n3, and human leukocyte interferon a.

In this study, the selected compounds that target DNA viruses such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster viruses (VZV) were acyclovir, ganciclovir, and foscarnet. Ribavirin has activity against a range of DNA and RNA viruses; in different cell lines, ED 50 ranges from 1 to 100 \u00b5g/mL. Antiretroviral (HIV) drugs include reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors and protease inhibitors. Selected HIV nucleoside RT inhibitors studied were zidovudine and lamivudine, while HIV protease inhibitors studied were indinavir, nelfinavir, and saquinavir. The third group of antivirals studied were the neuraminidase inhibitors, both commercially available preparations, zanamivir and oseltamivir were used in this study. Interferons were the next major class of antivirals studied. Various subtypes of interferon \u03b1 (2a, 2b, n1, and n3, human leukocyte) and \u03b2 (1a and 1b) were used. Amantadine, an old antiviral compound, was also studied. Different terms have been used to express antiviral activity, namely, EC 50 , 95% effective concentration (EC 95 ), and 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ); Table 1 illustrates the range of activity against selected viruses.",

Likewise, Roferon (IFN-\u03b1-2a) showed slight, incomplete inhibition at 50,000 IU/mL. Because the criteria for ascertaining anti-SARS-CoV activity in this screen were set at 100% inhibition of CPE, and as high doses of interferons may result in severe clinical side effects, we chose to conduct further evaluations only in the interferons that showed complete inhibition from initial screen, namely, Wellferon, Multiferon, Betaferon, and Alferon. Based upon results of the primary screen, the four active interferons and ribavirin were retested at two lower viral challenges, 10 3 and 10 2 PFU/ well. All four drugs again showed inhibitory effect, although the CIA 100 were dependent on viral loads (Table 3) . At the lowest viral load the CIA 100 were 5 IU/mL for both interferon \u03b2-1b (Betaferon) and human leukocyte interferon \u03b1 (Multiferon); and 50 and 250 IU/mL for interferon \u03b1-n3 (Alferon) and interferon \u03b1-n1 (Wellferon), respectively. No cytotoxicity of the interferons was observed at or near inhibitory concentrations. Ribavirin showed inhibitory activity at all three viral loads, but only at high concentrations of the drug, 0.5-5 mg/mL. At high concentrations of ribavirin (0.2-1 mg/mL) cytotoxic effects were observed on VeroE6 cells, as has been reported for other cell types (17, 18) .

Ribavirin, a drug widely used in initial efforts to manage SARS infections, inhibited CPE completely at 500-5,000 \u00b5g/mL at virus loads of 100-10,000 PFU per well. The concentration range observed is much higher than concentrations that inhibit other viruses (respiratory syncytial virus, ED 50 2-8 \u00b5g/mL, HIV or resistant strains of rhinovirus, 50-100 \u00b5g/mL), including viruses that were tested on Vero cells (West Nile virus, New York isolate 178 \u00b5g/mL, and Uganda isolate 41 \u00b5g/mL) (19) .

We observed slight cytotoxicity by microscopic examination of the cells, making it difficult to accurately obtain in vitro efficacy data against SARS-CoV. It appears that due to the low activity of ribavirin in vitro, inhibitory doses may not be achievable clinically. It is possible that ribavirin would be more effective in combination with interferons. Combination therapy with ribavirin and interferon \u03b1 has now become standard treatment for chronic hepatitis C (20) (21) (22) . Additionally, we have tested the effect of ribavirin and Betaferon in combination (range of concentration of ribavirin, 1-100 \u00b5g/mL; range of concentration of Betaferon, 0.1-10 IU/mL). At 1,000 PFU, this combination did not demonstrate observable synergistic inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV. This study describes in vitro activity of four interferon subtypes against the SARS-CoV. Interferons have been used as anticancer and antiviral agents, in particular, for treating hepatitis B and C infections. Various groups have reported the clinical benefit of intranasally administered interferon \u03b1 in human volunteers before and after inoculation with non-SARS coronaviruses (23) (24) (25) . The antiviral activity of interferons is mediated by direct effects on infected cells or by modulating an immune response (26) . Interferons interact with specific surface cell receptors, leading to production of interferon-stimulated gene products such as 2\u20325\u2032-oligoadenylate synthase and protein kinase PKR (27) .",

            "text": "In SARS-CoV infection, a convenient starting point for the use of interferons against a SARS-CoV infection would be the usual clinical doses for the treatment of hepatitis B or C. Common clinical dosages for interferon \u03b1 range from 3 to 5 million IU three times a week to 5 million IU daily. For interferon \u03b2, data regarding efficacy in the treatment of hepatitis C are conflicting, and interferon \u03b2 (at doses of 3 to 6 million IU three times weekly) is usually only used in the treatment of infections in patients whose condition no longer responds to other therapies. Plasma levels of interferons administered through the subcutaneous route are usually low with correspondingly short half-lives. In view of their mechanism of action, absolute serum levels may not be meaningful as a measure of the biologic activity of interferons, compared to the induction of cellular products such as 2\u20325\u2032 oligoadenylate synthase.",

Specific interferon subtypes which inhibit SARS-CoV in Vero cells may not necessarily have the same effect in other cells; the converse may also be true-that those drugs that are negative in Vero cells may be effective in other cell types. We are currently identifying other in vitro models of SARS-CoV infection that will enable us to address cell-type specific drug effects. Also, interferon subtypes exhibited different activity against SARS-CoV in this study. The mechanism for the difference in activity is unknown. Among the products tested, the source of interferon and amount of glycosylation differ. Some preparations were derived from human lymphoblastoid or leukocyte cells, while others were recombinantly produced in Escherichia coli or mammalian cell culture. We do not know the importance of this observation with respect to possible antiviral mechanisms of the interferons against SARS-CoV or potential clinical implications of these differences.",
