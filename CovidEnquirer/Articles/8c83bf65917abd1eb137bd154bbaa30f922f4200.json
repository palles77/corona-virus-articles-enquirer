            "text": "Viruses exhibit highly heterogeneous genome structures and replication strategies. These basic features correlate with viral propensity to mutate and, hence, with viral genetic diversity and evolvability. The mutation rates of viruses vary according to genome composition (RNA or DNA), size, and structure (single-or double-stranded). In general, RNA viruses produce from 10 \u22126 to 10 \u22124 new base substitutions per nucleotide per cell, whereas these rates range from 10 \u22128 to 10 \u22126 in DNA viruses (Fig. 1) . Furthermore, single-stranded viruses appear to mutate faster than double-stranded viruses, and an inverse correlation between genome size and mutation rate has also been demonstrated. Within the DNA virus group, thus, single-stranded viruses and, presumably, some double-stranded viruses with small genomes, mutate faster than double-stranded viruses with large genomes. The term quasispecies has been used to refer to highly heterogeneous viral populations in which the frequency of mutations in the population is determined by mutation rate and fitness. The quasispecies concept has thus been applied mainly to RNA viruses, owing to their particularly high mutation rates. High population genetic diversity is believed to play a pivotal role in the ability of RNA viruses to adapt to changing selective pressures and invade new hosts. Indeed, RNA viruses comprise a large number of wellknown human emerging or re-emerging pathogens such as HIV-1, hepatitis C virus, influenza virus, Ebola virus, and Zika virus among many others, as well as major plant and animal pathogens. In contrast, DNA viruses are typically less diverse and evolve more slowly, although they also include important pathogens such as herpesviruses and poxviruses. Nevertheless, the divide between RNA and DNA viruses is imperfect, since some RNA viruses evolve slowly and some DNA viruses are fast-evolving, particularly single-stranded and small double-stranded DNA viruses.",

Such selectivity is typically on the order of 10 4 -10 5 , and there appear to be no major differences among RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, reverse transcriptases (RTs), and DNA polymerases. Polymerase variants with altered selectivity and fidelity have been reported in a wide variety of RNA viruses. Serial transfers in the presence of the base analog ribavirin were first shown to select for an increased-fidelity polymerase in polioviruses. Ever since, tens of fidelity mutants have been identified amongst widely different RNA virus families. The evolution of high-and low-fidelity variants in response to selective pressures such as chemically-induced mutagenesis demonstrates that selection can optimize RNA virus replication fidelity. However, most RNA virus fidelity variants show only modest differences in base selectivity compared to the wild type, revealing strong structural or biochemical constraints. Interestingly, the fidelity of viral DNA polymerases appears to be less constrained.",

Currently, only coronavirus RNA polymerases have been shown to perform 3\u2032 exonuclease proofreading. Lack of proofreading is a major factor responsible for the higher rates of spontaneous mutation of RNA viruses compared to DNA viruses. Because RTs also lack 3\u2032 exonuclease activity, retroviruses and pararetroviruses mutate at rates similar to those of most RNA viruses. Although DNA virus replicases exhibit 3\u2032 exonuclease activity, certain amino acid replacements in their polymerases inactivate proofreading and produce a strong mutator phenotype, as shown for instance in bacteriophage T4. Interestingly, there are also amino acid replacements in the T4 polymerase that increase fidelity up to a hundred-fold compared to the wild type. Finally, polyomaviruses, which use host polymerases for replication, can encode proteins that inactivate the 3\u2032exonuclease proofreading domain of the host polymerase. Therefore, avoidance of proofreading may also be a mechanism whereby some DNA viruses increase their population diversity.",

RNA viruses are not substrates of cellular repair systems, whereas some DNA viruses have evolved specific features to avoid repair. This is the case of bacteriophage FX174 and potentially other small DNA phages. In Escherichia coli, strand-specific mismatch repair uses the methylation status of GATC sequence motifs to discern between the parental and daughter DNA strands. Interestingly, the FX174 genome is devoid of GATC motifs. This prevents methylation and thus, post-replicative repair, allowing the phage to increase its mutation rate relative to that of the host. Eukaryotic viruses might also avoid repair or dysregulate repair pathways to increase their mutation rates, although this has not been investigated in detail. ",

High rates of recombination may have been favored by natural selection to promote the fixation of new genotypes, to purge deleterious mutations, or as a by-product of other evolutionary processes. For recombination to introduce new genetic variants, it is required that the involved genomes differ by at least two mutations. Furthermore, the recombining molecules have to be present in the same cell. Hence, the emergence of new variants through recombination typically occurs in cells infected with different pre-existing variants. However, this may not happen frequently because super-infection exclusion renders infected cells refractory to re-infection with the same or a related virus. On the other hand, even if rare, recombination between distantly related viruses has the ability to introduce major genetic changes in a single event, such as gene transfer, leading to the emergence of new viral subtypes or even new species. Hence, recombination differs from mutation in the type and abundance of the genetic changes produced.",

Whereas the production of new variants through template switching also requires that the cell is coinfected with two different variants, in retroviruses such as HIV coinfection with two independent virions is not required because virions are diploid. In contrast to retroviruses and positive-stranded RNA viruses, most negative-stranded RNA viruses show very low rates of template switching. Similar to replication fidelity variants, viral polymerases with different propensities to template switching have been isolated. Such variants have allowed investigating the evolutionary implications of recombination from an experimental evolution approach using poliovirus.

DNA virus homology-dependent recombination can be mediated by cellular double-stranded break repair systems.

Some DNA viruses encode their own recombination systems. For instance, phage \u03bb recombination is active in cells deficient for the E. coli recombinase RecA. Also, the herpesviruses recombination machinery plays a major role during viral replication and repair. There is ample evidence that this type of recombination is sequence-dependent. For instance, the inverted terminal repeats of the vaccinia virus genome undergo rapid changes in size because this region contains multiple 10-100 bp repeats that are highly prone to unequal crossovers. Some viruses can use recombinogenic sequence motifs for targeting diversity towards certain genes. In poxviruses, this allows for a recombination-mediated gene amplification process that can temporarily increase the dosage of viral genes involved in evading host innate immunity.",

Yet, the fitness of a given allele is context-dependent in several ways, since it varies according to genotype-genotype and genotypeenvironment interactions. To a large extent, the environment of a virus is dictated by the host, but it can also be modulated by other members of the viral population via competition for cellular resources or cooperative interactions. Allele frequencies can also change as a result of random genetic drift. Drift is determined by the effective size of the viral population, which in turn depends on spatial structure, population size bottlenecks during host-to-host transmission, viral growth dynamics, and so on.

This implies that the mutation-selection balance tends to be reached in few generations and that, at equilibrium, most genetic variants have low population frequencies. Supporting this view, high-fidelity Illumina sequencing of experimental poliovirus populations has revealed a large number of deleterious variants at frequencies that are not detectable by conventional next-generation sequencing. A likely explanation for why s-values are high in RNA viruses is that their genomes are extremely compact, with few and often multifunctional and overlapping genes, many of which are essential.

Quasispecies were originally studied within the framework of physical chemistry as models for the dynamics of self-replicating sequences in a hypothetical primitive RNA world. However, due to the high mutation rates exhibited by RNA viruses, the theory subsequently became popular amongst virologists. Despite using different terminology, quasispecies and classical mutationselection models essentially deal with the same process and are largely equivalent. Yet, quasispecies models make a more explicit approach to mutant dynamics by explicitly considering the replicative rate of each sequence as well as the probability of each sequence mutating to another specific sequence. A transition matrix is thus defined, whose eigenvector with the highest eigenvalue defines a stable mutation-selection balance. This approach defines fitness as a property of the ensemble of sequences present at equilibrium (the quasispecies). As a consequence, fitness is not merely determined by the initial sequence, but also by its mutational neighborhood. This means that a quasispecies containing a maximally fit individual sequence might be outcompeted by another quasispecies that does not contain the fittest sequence but shows higher average fitness. This phenomenon is called the survival of the flattest. A related prediction of quasispecies models is that, beyond a certain mutation rate, the fittest sequence within a given quasispecies can be outnumbered by its own cloud of deleterious mutants, a process known as error catastrophe. How this process occurs depends on the topology of the fitness landscape. Original quasispecies models assumed a landscape with a single high-fitness sequence (master) in which all mutants had the same fitness value. In this particular system, beyond the error threshold all mutants reach a frequency similar to that of the master and, since there is an extremely large number of such possible mutants, the actual frequency of the master sequence becomes vanishingly small.",

Treatment of RNA virus experimental populations with chemical mutagens has provided ample support for the feasibility of mutation-driven extinction in cell cultures and even in animal models. However, error catastrophe models only deal with the fitness of certain sequences relative to others, and thus ignore the fact that extinction is an absolute, demographical process that takes place when the basic reproductive number of a population decays below one. It has been thus suggested that Fig. 2 Genetic, demographical, and ecological processes determining viral population diversity. Mutation is the ultimate source of genetic variation, but recombination also produces new genotypes. Ecological and demographical processes determine how natural selection and random genetic drift acts on these new genetic variants. This leads to a variety of possible population genetic processes, which in turn feedback on viral demography, ecology and genetics. Immune escape, drug resistance, and pathogenesis are a visible consequence of such processes. The list of factors shown is not exhaustive.",

            "text": "The high mutation rates exhibited by RNA viruses reduce the waiting times required for the emergence of selectively beneficial mutations compared to other microorganisms. The emergence of beneficial mutations is also favored by the extremely high population sizes of RNA viruses, which is on the order of billions of infectious particles per infected host. For a mutation rate of 10 \u22125 substitutions per nucleotide per round of genome copying, replication of a population of 10 9 viral particles should produce as many as 10 4 mutations, which approaches the total number of possible single-point mutations in a typical 10 kb RNA virus genome. This makes RNA viruses extremely responsive to host adaptive immunity, antiviral drugs, and other rapidly-changing selective pressures. Yet, despite favoring the appearance of beneficial alleles, high mutation rates can hamper their fixation process in the population. First, at high mutation rates, many genomes carry several deleterious mutations, and beneficial mutations may fail to be selected if they occur in low-fitness genetic backgrounds. Alternatively, if the beneficial effect of a mutation exceeds the disadvantageous effect of other mutations present in the same genome, deleterious mutations can undergo fixation, a process known as genetic hitch-hiking. Another \"traffic issue\" in fastmutating systems is clonal interference, a process whereby multiple beneficial mutations coexist in the same population and only the fittest variant is selected, leading to extinction of other beneficial variants. Since lower mutation rates increase waiting times for the emergence of beneficial mutations but higher mutation rates reduce the efficiency with which beneficial mutations are selected, adaptation should be maximal for some intermediate, optimal mutation rate. A similar optimality argument can be used for neutral evolution. Analysis of empirical data suggests that RNA viruses replicate at nearly-optimum mutation rates. Lastly, clonal interference, counter-selection of beneficial alleles in low-fitness genetic backgrounds and hitch-hiking can all be dissipated by recombination, since recombination can break disadvantageous genetic combinations and create new ones.",

            "text": "The fitness of a given virus can be modified by other viruses of the same population. Such interactions can be cooperative or competitive, and are more likely to occur among viruses infecting the same cell because this allows them to share proteins. Coinfection of a cell with independent virions requires a high local density of viral particles. However, many viruses spread as collective infectious units composed of multiple particles, which promotes coinfection even at low overall viral densities. When a situation in which each cell receives multiple viral particles is maintained for several infection cycles, defective viruses tend to invade the population. Defective viruses, produced by illegitimate recombination, lack large portions of the genome and can only replicate as hyper-parasites at the expense of complete viral genomes present in the same cell. In addition to replicating faster than the wild type because their genomes are shorter, defective viruses often interfere with some steps of the infectious cycle. Hence, the fitness values of both the wild type and the defective viruses are frequency-dependent. Viral interference can produce sharp drops in fitness, which has led to suggest defective interfering viruses as possible antivirals. The emergence of interfering viruses can also be promoted by chemically induced mutagenesis in RNA viruses. On the other hand, coinfection of cells with different virus variants may allow for cooperative virus-virus interactions. In principle, two viruses each carrying a different genetic defect can mutually increase their fitness values if they share gene products (genetic complementation). It is also possible that each variant has optimized a different aspect of the infection cycle, and that such variants achieve higher fitness in coinfection than alone. This type of cooperative interaction has been suggested for measles virus and influenza virus, and might contribute to the maintenance of viral genetic diversity because fitness would be maximal at intermediate frequencies of each variant in the population. Therefore, diversity can lead to negative or positive virus-virus interactions. In turn, these interactions feedback on diversity by modifying the population frequency of certain variants.",

            "text": "Despite their enormous population sizes, viruses experience significant genetic drift. This is because the strength of drift depends on the effective population size, not on the census size. Demographical bottlenecks have a strong and long-lasting effect on effective population sizes, and such bottlenecks occur extensively during inter-host transmission in nearly all viruses. The size of the founder population following inter-host transmission has been estimated using genetic markers, and is typically lower than 10 genome copies. This number, though, can vary widely depending on transmission route (aerosol, fecal-oral, sexual, insect-borne, etc.) . Additionally, viral infections show extensive intra-host spatial structure caused by restrictions to viral trafficking among tissues or organs (organ compartmentalization) as well as by the limited diffusion of virions in the extracellular milieu (localized infection foci). Spatial structure also reduces effective population sizes, hence promoting drift. The immediate consequence of drift is the loss of genetic diversity, because only a subset of the population contributes to the next generation. A longer-term consequence is the random fixation of alleles in the population. In highly variable populations such as those of RNA viruses and at sufficiently low population sizes, drift can result in the loss of the wild-type sequence. In the absence of back mutation or recombination, this loss is irreversible and hence leads to the accumulation of random mutations in the population, most of which are neutral or deleterious. This process, known as Muller\u00b4s ratchet, reduces mean population fitness and can endanger the survival of small RNA virus populations.",

The association between RNA virus population diversity and pathogenesis has been examined using polymerase fidelity variants. Increased-fidelity variants are typically attenuated in animal models, suggesting a role for viral population diversity in causing disease. This was first shown using a variant of poliovirus carrying a single amino acid replacement in the polymerase that confers an approximately three-fold increase in replication fidelity. Since these experiments involved acute infections, adaptive immunity was probably not responsible for the observed association between population diversity and pathogenesis, and the mechanism linking intra-host viral diversity with pathogenesis has not been elucidated. Importantly, low-fidelity variants have also been tested and found to be attenuated. A candidate alternative explanation for these results is that in RNA viruses, high mutation rates have been selected as a byproduct of selection for high replicative speed. Increasing fidelity would come at the cost of slower growth, hence producing an attenuated phenotype. On the other hand, decreasing fidelity further would elevate the mutational load of the population, reducing mean population fitness at mutation-selection balance or promoting error catastrophe.",

            "text": "In chronic infections such as those caused by HIV or hepatitis B and C, among others, adaptive immune responses involving neutralizing antibodies and cytotoxic T cells select for escape mutants during the course of infection. In HIV-1, the ability of the virus to escape immunity partially correlates with its ability to generate a genetically diverse intra-host population. DNA viruses such as, for instance, herpes simplex virus also cause chronic infections and, hence, have to cope with the adaptive immune response as well. Yet, their strategy for evading immune responses appears to be based on latency rather than on the continual production of immune escape variants. In viruses causing acute infections, adaptive immunity escape mutants are also selected, but this process occurs mainly at the inter-host population level. For this selection to occur, hosts need to recover from infection. This creates a host subpopulation immunized against the virus variant that originally infected them, thus favoring escape variants. This process has been amply documented for influenza virus, and is called antigenic drift or antigenic shift, depending on the diversity-generating process at play. Antigenic drift is mainly based on point mutations that change epitope sequences, whereas antigenic shift occurs as a result of segment reassortments that produce new subtype combinations. Finally, immune escape is not restricted to vertebrate viruses. For instance, bacteria use clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and associated proteins as an adaptive immune system. Bacteriophages can escape CRISPR via point mutations and have also evolved anti-CRISPR proteins (Acrs) of variable strength.",

The first attempts to treat AIDS using base analogs failed due to the emergence of drug-resistant mutants. Monotherapies were subsequently replaced with combination therapies aimed at preventing drug resistance, which have been successful despite the remarkable genetic variability of HIV-1 intra-host populations. A similar scenario applies to hepatitis C virus, in which resistance against protease inhibitor-based monotherapies emerges rapidly through one or few mutations, thus requiring the use of combination therapies. Targeting different steps of the viral infection cycle, such as for instance nucleoside analog-based polymerase inhibitors and protease inhibitors reduces the risk of resistance compared to combination therapies aiming at a single target. An alternative antiviral treatment consists in taking advantage of the highly error-prone replication of RNA viruses to promote viral extinction via lethal mutagenesis using nucleoside analogs or other mutagenic compounds. This type of treatment can select for high-fidelity polymerases that partially compensate the mutagenic effect of the drugs, although this might not be sufficient for preventing viral extinction. In other cases, drug-resistance against mutagenesis may fail to evolve. Finally, yet another alternative treatment strategy that has been designed to minimize the evolution of drug resistance consists in targeting host factors such as molecular chaperones, the viral receptor, or proteins involved in the immune response.",

Here, we have shown how viral diversity is generated by widely different molecular mechanisms, including lack of proofreading, avoidance of DNA repair, host-mediated viral genome editing, and specific diversity-generating modules, as well as different mechanisms of recombination. However, viral diversity does not only depend on these purely genetic factors. Ecological and demographic processes determine the action of natural selection and random genetic drift, producing a myriad of different population genetic processes, of which pathogenesis, immune escape, and drug resistant are observable consequences. Therefore, viral population diversity and evolution should help us develop more efficient antiviral control and treatment strategies.",
