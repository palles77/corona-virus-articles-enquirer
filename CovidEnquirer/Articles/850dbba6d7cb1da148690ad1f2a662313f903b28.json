This is increasingly being utilised in both acute and chronic conditions. Strong evidence supports the use of NIPPV for acute respiratory failure (ARF) to prevent endotracheal intubation (ETI) and to facilitate extubation in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, to avoid ETI in acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (ACPO), and in immunocompromised patients. Weaker evidence supports the use of NIPPV for patients with ARF due to asthma exacerbations, with postoperative ARF, pneumonia and acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome. NIPPV should be applied under close monitoring for signs of treatment failure and, in such cases, ETI should be promptly available. A trained team, at an appropriate location, with careful patient selection and optimal choice of devices can optimise the outcome of NIPPV.",

A meta-analysis suggests that CPAP has a greater efficacy in reducing mortality. 11 However, some other study 12 suggests that BiPAP may be preferable for patients with persisting dyspnoea or hypercapnia after initiation of CPAP. Though there was an early concern about possible greater risk of myocardial infarction with NIPPV, subsequent study has not confirmed the same. 13 In a multicentre randomised controlled trial 14 that compared BiPAP (12/5 cm H 2 O) to CPAP (8 cm H 2 O), the two modes were equally effective in reducing respiratory frequency, disposal, and need for invasive mechanical ventilation, and in improving arterial blood gases. NIPPV benefits these patients by causing decreased left ventricular pre-and after-load owing to increased intrathoracic pressure, resulting in improved cardiac performance. Inotropic effect of raised intrathoracic pressure also helps by augmentation of cardiac contractility. Re-opening of collapsed alveoli increases the functional residual capacity (FRC). This improves oxygenation and reduces work of breathing. However, by reduction of preload, NIPPV can sometimes be counter-productive by decreasing cardiac output.",
