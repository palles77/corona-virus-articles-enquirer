The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that sleep disturbance mediates the relationship between attachment insecurity and three measures of health (perceived general health, physical symptoms and sick days) in a group that is at high risk of sleep disturbance: hospital based health-care workers. Methods: One hundred thirty-one nondepressed female hospital workers completed self-report measures of adult attachment, sleep disturbance, depressive symptoms (excluding sleep-related items) and health outcomes. The hypothesis of mediation was tested with sequential regression analyses. Results: Both attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance were significantly associated with impair-ment in global sleep quality (\u03c1=.20 and .19, respectively, Pb.05) and physical symptoms (\u03c1=.21 and .19, Pb.05). Attachment anxiety was also associated with depressive symptoms (\u03c1=.33, Pb.001) and sick days (\u03c1=.21, Pb.05). For both physical symptoms and sick days, mediation analyses were consistent with global sleep quality acting as a partial mediator of the relationship between attachment anxiety and physical health. Non-sleep-related depressive symptoms were a stronger mediator. Conclusions: This study corroborates evidence that attachment insecurity is associated with sleep disturbance and extends this association to the occurrence of physical symptoms and time off work due to sickness among workers in a high-stress occupation.",

Briefly, the study took place in 13 hospital sites in Toronto and Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, between October 2004 and September 2005, 13-26 months after the resolution of the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Eligible health-care workers included nurses in medical and surgical inpatient units and all staff of intensive care units, emergency departments and SARS isolation units in these hospitals. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Board of each hospital. Participants were surveyed in two waves. The first wave consisted of a survey that included the demographic indices, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and measures of symptoms and sick days. Of the 769 health-care workers (668 women and 101 men) who completed this survey, 180 (163 women and 17 men) also participated in a second wave (Survey B + diagnostic interview), which included a measure of adult attachment. Subjects who participated or did not participate in Survey B were compared on a wide range of psychological and demographic indices and found to be similar [23] . In addition, participants in the second wave did not differ from those who participated only in the first wave with respect to sleep indices. Since the relationships that are tested in this study may vary with sex and the number of men who completed Survey B is small, we report here only on the women who completed all of the measures analyzed in this report (n=141), excluding 10 further subjects who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for current major depression as assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV [24, 25] .",

The results of this study are also consistent with previous reports that attachment anxiety is associated with reports of physical symptoms [3, 32] . The finding that attachment avoidance is not related to perceived general health or sick days is consistent with previous research showing the associations between attachment avoidance and aspects of physical health to be weaker and less consistent than is found for attachment anxiety. There are several aspects of the three-way relationship among attachment, sleep and health that require further discussion. First, the distribution of adult attachment patterns in this study was unusual since attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance were strongly correlated. Since the independence of these dimensions when measured by the ECR-R has been confirmed in several studies [33] , their relationship in this study is likely a characteristic of the study sample. A higher than expected intercorrelation suggests that hospital workers who are higher in one dimension of attachment insecurity tend to also be higher the other dimension. Shaver and Mikulincer [34] understand the co-occurrence of attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance (also called \"fearful attachment\") as the result of a failure of avoidant defenses in the face of overwhelming stress. In other words, the cooccurrence of these dimensions of attachment insecurity is found in individuals who are predisposed to an avoidant response to attachment stressors (rather than an anxiouspreoccupied response), who then experience circumstances in which the avoidant response fails to protect them from underlying attachment-related anxiety. This formulation might help to explain the strong relationship between the dimensions of insecurity in this study, particularly if healthcare workers differ from other cohorts in being more prone to avoidant and less prone to anxious-preoccupied responses to attachment stressors. In that case, health-care workers who express attachment insecurity would tend to vary along a single dimension from secure to fearful (combined attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance) because it would be relatively unusual for them to express attachment anxiety alone. Although this speculation conforms to the common sense assumption that anxious attachment styles are not adaptive for those who work in hospitals and thus are underrepresented in a group of veteran (median years of experience=20) hospital workers, there is no evidence from other research that the attachment patterns of health-care workers differ from those found in the general population. Further studies of the adult attachment characteristics of health-care workers may clarify this finding. Since sex differences in adult attachment styles are modest [35] , the correlation of attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance is not explained by this study being restricted to women.",

The pattern of these analyses was similar for these two measures of physical health. In each case the contribution of attachment anxiety to explaining variance in reported physical health is reduced by adding global sleep quality to the model and is rendered nonsignificant by entering depressive symptoms into the model. Depressive symptoms account for substantially more of the variance in indices of physical symptoms than is accounted for by attachment anxiety alone or by global sleep quality. Thus, depressive symptoms mediate the link between attachment anxiety and physical symptoms more strongly than global sleep quality does and make a further contribution to physical symptoms that is independent of attachment insecurity and global sleep quality. In order to interpret this pattern, it is useful to refer to the results of previous research. First, attachment insecurity is a risk factor for both depressive symptoms and the syndrome of major depression [21, 40] . Second, both attachment anxiety and depressive symptoms are known to be consistently related to physical symptoms [3, 22] . Thus, the strong mediating relationship of depressive symptoms is expected. What this study asks, beyond the latter relationship, is what role impaired sleep might have. It appears that impaired sleep is related to both attachment insecurity and to physical symptoms but is not as strong a mediator as depressive symptoms.",

With respect to temporal order, a mediating process must follow its cause (independent variable) and precede its effect (dependent variable) [41] . The cross-sectional study design does not allow us to test the assumption that attachment style is a stable variable that precedes sleep disturbance. Previous research indicates that adult attachment patterns are usually sufficiently stable over time to be considered trait phenomena [33] , which therefore are likely to temporally precede the state phenomena of impaired sleep quality, depressive symptoms and physical symptoms. However, sleep disturbance among health-care workers is also a chronic phenomenon. Furthermore, the relationship between disturbed sleep and impaired health is complex and bidirectional. Prospective research is required to confirm the temporal sequence of the relationships found in this study. Evidence from previous research suggests that impaired sleep and depressive symptoms may have a bidirectional relationship and that chronic sleep impairment and depressive symptoms increase in concert with each other in healthcare workers [42] . The current study cannot tease apart the interrelationship of sleep and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, it is not known prior to replication studies if the findings of this study can be generalized to other groups of people, given that there are several characteristics of the current cohort that are special (i.e., women in health-care professions, many of whom are shift workers).",

The correlation between subjectively impaired quality of sleep as measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and objective measures of sleep physiology has been inconsistent [43, 44] , and so replication using polysomnographic sleep measures would be valuable. On the other hand, two previous studies support a link between attachment insecurity and sleep physiology [19, 20] , and so the correlation between attachment anxiety and global sleep quality in the current study is unlikely to be entirely due to a subjective reporting bias.",
