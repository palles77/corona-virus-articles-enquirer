            "text": "One of the major and earliest means by which recombinant DNA and hybridoma technologies will benefit mankind will be to improve animal production by reducing morbidity and mortality from infectious disease by providing the animal health care industry with efficacious vaccines and antitoxins. Of the 45 million cattle born last year in the United States, approximately 7% died of infectious disease (1) . Similarly, of the 94 million swine born approximately 15% died of infectious disease. These losses occurred despite the use of conventional vaccines, large amounts of antibiotics, and other medicinals. Since antibiotic treatment does not represent an effective means of reducing the severity of disease caused by viruses, many virus-induced diseases go unchecked because of either the unavailability of appropriate vaccines or the availability of ineffective vaccines. Recombinant DNA procedures will enable the development of vaccines for viruses which grow poorly, or not at all, in cell culture and for which there are therefore presently none available. Moreover, a genetically engineered subunit vaccine should not only exhibit the features of potency and efficacy, if correctly designed, but also safety and stability at ambient temperatures, as well. Immunologically, the genetically-engineered vaccine must be developed in such a fashion as to be administered in a single dose and induce immunity of long duration. It must protect against as many serotypes of a virus in a given geographic region as possible and must not induce adverse reactions. In addition to these biological features, a genetically-engineered vaccine will exhibit several attractive manufacturing considerations including ease of manufacturing, economy of production, and long shelf life.",

Of particular interest to veterinary medicine are therapeutic applications of monoclonal antibodies for passive immunization against certain infectious diseases. In our survey of veterinary infectious diseases, we have identified several syndromes in which treatment would best be accomplished by passive immunization employing monoclonal antibodies. For one of these disease syndromes, namely, E. coli-induced neonatal diarrhea or scours, both conventional and genetically-engineered vaccines are available, however, a therapeutic approach involving a passive immunization program employing monoclonal antibodies appears to be far superior to vaccination as the preferred method of preventing the disease. Results from clinical testing summarized herein and presented in detail elsewhere (3) indicate that use of such monoclonal antibodies does indeed represent a highly efficacious method of curtailing scours in calves and pigs, and obviate the need for a costly vaccination program thereby easing the burden of managing farm animals.",

These particular organisms produce disease through colonization of the gut employing the strain K99 pilus antigen,which is the major adherence factor found on enterotoxigenic strains of E. coli,and subsequent production of enterotoxins which cause diarrhea by villous hypersecretion (4). Since colonization is considered an essential step in the pathogenesis of enterotoxigenic colibacillosis, the strategy of blocking bacterial adherence in the small intestine by passive immunization employing monoclonal antibody specific to the pilus antigen should in theory reduce the severity of the disease. Several previous studies in fact lend support to this particular approach. First, newborn calves challenged with K99 strains of E. coli were protected from fatal diarrhea if they were permitted to ingest the colostrum of cows previously vaccinated with purified K99 pilus antigen (5) . Second, several vaccine trials using a variety of K99 pilus-containing preparations including whole bacterins and crude extracts also demonstrated that passive antibody against the K99 phi of E. coli would prevent severe or fatal diarrhea (6, 7) . In all of these studies, passive antibody reached the intestines of suckling calves through the colostrum of dams vaccinated prior to parturition.",

Livestock owners are reluctant to accept the cost and inconvenience of preventive vaccination unless they have recently experienced an outbreak of neonatal colibacillosis in their herds. Such outbreaks are difficult to predict since the epizootiology of calf scours includes a variety of management and environmental factors. These concerns prompted investigation of an alternative method for direct passive immunization of newborn calves, namely the oral administration of K99-specific monoclonal antibody to calves at birth.",

Supernatants from hybridomas were screened for K99-reactive antibody by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using K99 pilus as the antigen. Single hybridoma cell lines producing large amounts of K99-specific monoclonal antibody were isolated by limiting dilution analysis and screening by ELISA. K99-specific hybridomas were injected intraperitoneally into preconditioned specific pathogen free Balb/C mice and ascites fluid collected 10-30 days later.",

            "text": "The basic protocol for developing genetically-engineered vaccines includes: l)identification of the major viral surface antigen which will induce antibody capable of neutralizing or inactivating the infectious organism; 2) identification of the surface antigen gene or the specific antigenic determinants contained within the gene; and, 3) isolation and transfer of this gene into a plasmid vector capable of expressing large amounts of its product in fermentable organisms such as bacteria or yeast. The approach to identifying and isolating a surface antigen determinant from a DNA virus and an RIA virus differ slightly. For example, the location of the surface antigen gene on a DNA virus can be determined by a variety of methods involving genetic or biochemical approaches. One of the more conventional genetic approaches involves the generation of mutations in the viral genome and the analysis of mutant viruses for structural alterations in the surface antigen component, whereas a standard biochemical approach involves either selection of viral mRNA followed by translation in cell-free systems to determine the specific mRNA species that codes for the surface antigen of interest, or coupled in vitro transcription/translation of various restriction endonuclease fragments of the viral DNA. For PIA viruses, the viral genome is generally reverse transcribed into a DNA copy prior to molecular cloning. In some instances, the surface antigen gene can be isolated during this step by synthesis of specific oligonucleotides representing sequences of the surface antigen derived from amino acid sequencing of the amino and carboxyl end of the surface antigen purified from the virus capsid. These synthetic oligonucleotides are then employed as primers for copying only the surface antigen gene into DNA by the enzyme reverse transcriptase. The surface antigen gene is then spliced into a plasmid vector created specifically to enable expression of the surface antigen in microorganisms such as E. coli. We have also found that creating gene fusions between the viral surface antigen gene and certain prokaryotic or eukaryotic genes appears to offer distinct advantages over the surface antigen itself in certain instances. These advantages include: 1) stabilization of the surface antigen gene product in bacteria; 2) increase immunogenicity of the surface antigen by prohibiting folding of the protein which may otherwise hide or mask the specific antigenic determinants required for generating neutralizing antibody; and, 3) possible immunological enhancement or adjuvant effect due to the presence of the additional nucleotide sequences adjacent to the surface antigen gene. The fused or chimeric genes may also actually help to identify bacteria colonies that are expressing high levels of the surface antigen, particularly if the fusion protein exhibits enzymatic activity for which an assay can readily be established. For one such enzyme, -galactosidase, we have designed cloning vectors and developed a cloning procedure that facilitates the identification of bacteria expressing high levels of the surface antigen, or specific fragments of the surface antigen containing the necessary antigenic determinants required for neutralization, by virtue of high levels of the -galactosidase activity present (FIGURE 2). This procedure has the added feature of eliminating the need to locate and isolate the surface antigen gene on the virus genome since it enables one;f irst,to molecularly clone random fragments of the entire viral genome; second, to select for those bacteria colonies expressing high levels of the viral gene-b-galactosidase fusion protein; and, finally, to utilize neutralizing antibodies to identify colonies that are producing antigens containing the desired antigenic determinants. The vectors designed for this procedure are unable to express -galactosidase activity without a viral DNA fragment inserted, as the amino-terminal portion of the coding region (5' to the cloning site) is out of phase with respect to the carboxy-terminal portion (3' to the cloning site) . Insertion of a DNA fragment of the proper number of nucleotides into the cloning site in the proper translational reading phase with the amino terminal portion, allows translation of the carboxy-terminal portion in phase, and synthesis of a hybrid gene protein which exhibits bgalactosidase activity. Such clones can be identified on certain indicator plates, e.g. Maconkey-lactose or X-G, and screened for the production of the desired antigenic determinants using viral-specific antiserum.",

This reagent has been effective in significantly reducing the morbidity and mortality due to enterotoxigenic strains of E. coli in clinical studies to date when administered orally in skim milk to both colostrum fed and colostrum-deprived calves. The results of our studies indicate that monoclonal antibody directed against the K-99 pilus significantly reduced mortality in newborn calves challenged with a fatal dose of K99 strains of E. coli. This reduced mortality can be explained as the result of monoclonal antibody inhibiting the colonization of the intestine by K99 strains of E. coli. Antibodies directed against other capsular and somatic antigens of K99 E. coli did not appear to be involved in reduced mortality. The occurrence of enterotoxigenic colibacillosis in calves is often sporatic, depending on the interaction of factors such as colostrum ingestion, weather changes and stocking rates. Since the incidence of disease is low in some years it may be hard to convince livestock owners that vaccination of cows to prevent scours is cost effective. If outbreaks of K99-induced neonatal diarrhea subsequently occur, it is generally too late to vaccinate cows for passive protection of their offspring. The oral administration of K99-specific monoclonal antibody to calves at birth may be an effective way to reduce the economic loss to farmers when outbreaks of confirmed scours occur in herds in which cows have not been previously vaccinated. This novel form of therapy of calf scours obviates the need for vaccination and will, therefore, not only provide a much better approach for reducing spread of scours but will also benefit the farmer financially, as well. This is the first clinical use of a monoclonal antibody for passive immunization in veterinary medicine (3) .",

Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by fluorography. FMDV -lanes 1 and 2 represent two different fusion proteins. I-induced, U= uninduced except for FMDV and PR' where only the induced tracks are provided. The PR' fusion protein was located via tiWestern blotting employing radiolabeled antisera.",
