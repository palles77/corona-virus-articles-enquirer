Understanding the prognostic value of microbes identified from the upper respiratory tract (a convenient sampling site) is a necessary first step to understand potential for upper respiratory tract POCTs in assisting antimicrobial treatment decisions for respiratory infections (RTIs). The aim was to investigate the relationship between upper respiratory tract microbial detection and disease prognosis, including effects of antimicrobial use. Methods: Data sources were the MEDLINE and Embase databases. Study eligibility criteria consisted of quantitative studies reporting microbiological and prognostic data from patients of all age groups presenting with RTI. Patients presenting to healthcare or research settings with RTI participated. Interventions included upper respiratory tract swab. The methods used were systematic review and meta-analysis. Results: Searches identified 5156 articles, of which 754 were duplicates and 4258 excluded on title or abstract. A total of 144 full texts were screened; 21 articles were retained. Studies reported data for 15 microbes and 26 prognostic measures (390 potential associations). One hundred and seven (27%) associations were investigated statistically, of which 38 (36%) were significant. Most studies reported only prognostic value of test positive results. Meta-analyses suggested hospitalization duration was longer for patients with respiratory syncytial virus than adenovirus and influenza, but significant heterogeneity was observed between studies. Conclusions: A quarter of potential prognostic associations have been investigated. Of these, a third were significant, suggesting considerable potential for POCT. Future research should investigate prognostic value of positive and negative tests, and interactions between test results, use of antimicrobials and microbial resistance.",

Primary care clinicians are responsible for the majority of human antibiotic use in the UK, USA and Europe. Paediatric RTI is the most common presentation managed by primary care physicians [1, 2] . Antibiotics are prescribed at up to 67% of RTI consultations [3] , yet there is strong evidence that a large proportion of these prescriptions are unnecessary [4, 5] . Antibiotic overprescribing has been partially attributed to uncertainty described by clinicians in identifying patients who may subsequently develop serious illness and require hospital intervention [6] . Policy makers, primary care clinicians and the research community are calling for evidence to help differentiate patients who would benefit from antimicrobials from those who would not [5, 7, 8] .",

The burden placed on primary care means that evidence-based algorithms and tests are actively being sought; for example, an algorithm to identify children at risk of hospitalization has recently been developed in a large observational study [9] . However, this algorithm does not differentiate bacterial from viral infection. Additionally, C-reactive protein blood testing to target prescribing in adults and children is being investigated [10] but is not routinely used in the UK. A third possible strategy, and the subject of this review, is to rapidly test respiratory microbiological samples. Point-of-care test technology is rapidly developing: test devices are now able to detect common respiratory tract microbes in 20 min to 2 hr [11] , and could therefore be of value in primary care.",
