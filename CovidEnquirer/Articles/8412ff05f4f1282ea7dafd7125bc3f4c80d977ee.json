The differences between camelids and ruminants should exclude camelids from being classified as ruminants. Nonetheless, camelids have been placed in various categories, such as \"exotic animals,\" \"wild animals,\" \"other livestock species,\" and \"ruminants,\" by state and federal regulators. Camelids have consistently been subjected to sudden, adverse regulations (some inappropriate) when an emerging disease of livestock appears on the scene.",

            "text": "Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus is highly contagious in cattle and sheep. When llamas and alpacas were first imported from South America to the United States for the blossoming private llama industry, government officials expressed concern that llamas and alpacas might pose a risk for the introduction of FMD to the United States. The USDA expended con-siderable experimental effort to determine the risk. It was concluded that llamas and alpacas could be infected by inoculation but did not acquire FMD when cohabiting with infected swine, in contrast with almost 100% of cattle that acquired the infection. 6, 25, 30 The virus could not be detected after 14 days postinoculation.",
