In this construct, the GP67sp signal peptide promoted the secretion of the recombinant protein into the culture medium, and improved protein expression and purification. Enhanced green fluorescent protein, coexpressed through an internal ribosome entry site, served as a visible reporter for protein expression detection. The hemolymph of Spodoptera litura larvae infected with the bi-cistronic baculovirus was collected for the purification of the recombinant HA1, which was found to be glycosylated, and monomeric and trimeric forms of the recombinant HA1 were identified. Proteins expressed in both the cell culture and larvae served as effective subunit vaccines for the production of antiserum against HA. The antiserum recognized the H6 subtype of AIV but not the H5 subtype.",

            "text": "In the last decade, avian influenza virus (AIV) has provoked seasonal epidemics and caused severely infectious respiratory disease (Palache et al., 2015) . AIV is a member of the Ortho-myxoviridae family and involves two major surface glycoproteins: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) (Gamblin and Skehel, 2010; Zhu et al., 2013) . On the surface of influenza A virus, 18 subtypes of HA, and 11 subtypes of NA are present (Mehle, 2014) . HA is a lectin that mediates binding of virus and the sialic acid receptor on the host cell membrane, facilitating entry of the viral genome into the host (Skehel and Wiley, 2000) . A tryptic cleavage in the molecule of HA produces HA1 and HA2 fragments. This post-translational cleavage, formed by trypsin, activates the receptor binding domain (RBD) on HA1 so that it may bind to the host receptor. HA is a vital antigen, but it is inclined to mutate to escape the attack from the immune system ( Van de Sandt et al., 2012) . Glycosylation on HA may play a critical role in triggering an immune response (Wang et al., 2009; He et al., 2015) . Traditional human inactivated vaccines for influenza are produced by using the specific-pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated egg method, which requires specialized equipment and complex procedures (Nunez et al., 2015) . However, some people are allergic to eggs, and inoculation with these vaccines involves risk (Franceschini et al., 2015) . A subunit vaccine for AIV produced using a recombinant protein expression system may serve as an alternative.",

AcMNPV has been utilized in biopesticides and as a vector for foreign gene expression to produce recombinant proteins (Kost et al., 2005) . Yang et al. (2007) constructed a pseudotyped baculovirus that expressed HA on the viral surface and showed vaccine potential. Musthaq et al. (2014) expressed HA of the H6 subtype of AIV and displayed it on the baculovirus envelope, demonstrating its protective efficacy for mice against H6 influenza virus. However, in these methods, production of unrelated antibodies against several indigenous proteins from baculovirus was cause for concern. The production and use of a purified subunit vaccine should be straightforward and convenient. The protein expression level in insect cells is relatively low, and the target protein may be cleaved by proteases released from the cells. If the recombinant protein secretes into a culture medium, and a visible reporter may be introduced into the construct to serve as an indicator for protein expression, facilitating the determination of the precise time for cell harvest.",

Therefore, we designed a dual expression system led by single promoter for the co-expression of the target H6 subtype HA1 protein (H6HA1-His) and the reporter (enhanced green fluorescent protein, EGFP). An internal ribosome entry site (IRES) was applied to translate EGFP by starting its initiation in the middle of mRNA (Finkelstein et al., 1999; Chen et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2012) . For the production of the secreted recombinant HA1 to facilitate purification, we first examined the expression and secretion efficiency for H6HA1-His in three signal peptides. Among these signal peptides, GP67sp has been used for its expression of HA in a baculovirus system (Whitford et al., 1989; Cui et al., 2011) . After successful expression in insect cells, the vector was used to infect insect larvae, which served as bioreactors. Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) and silkworm systems have been reported to exhibit high protein expression levels (Katsuma et al., 2006; Kato et al., 2010; Kajikawa, 2012) . As an alternative, we developed an AcMNPV expression platform (Choi et al., 2012) in Spodoptera litura (cotton leafworm or tobacco cutworm), which is often used in academic research and is easy to breed and manage. The expression and purification of the H6HA1-His recombinant protein in the insect cells and larvae, the protein structure and modification of the expressed proteins, and the use of the proteins for immunization in mice are discussed in this report and are summarized in Fig. 1 .",

The coding sequence of the signal peptides used in this work (i.e. AIVsp, hAZsp, and GP67sp) was ligated upstream of the H6HA1-His coding sequence by overhang extension PCR (Kadkhodaei et al., 2016) . The polyhedrin promotor gene of AcMNPV (PPH) was used to drive the H6HA1-His recombinant protein (Possee and Howard, 1987) . Subsequently, the RhPV-IRES derived from Rhopalosiphum padi virus (Wu et al., 2012) , followed by the EGFP reporter gene, was ligated to the downstream of the GP67-H6HA1-His coding sequence. The final pFastBac-GP67-H6HA1-His-RhPV-IRES-EGFP construct was transferred to DH10Bac competent cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the recombinant bacmid was produced according to the manufacturer's instructions. Four potential N-linked glycosylation sites on H6HA1-His (Asn-11, Asn-23, Asn-167, and Asn-291) were mutated to alanine through PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (He et al., 2015) .",

This was confirmed by the finding that if one of the glycosylated sites on HA1 (Asn 167) was mutated to Ala (N167A), the molecular mass of HA1 decreased. Additionally, when all four glycosylation sites on HA1 were mutated (i.e. N11A, N23A, N167A, and N291A), the mutant exhibited an even smaller molecular mass of 38 kDa (Fig. 3A, lane M4) . Furthermore, if the recombinant protein was treated with peptide-Nglycosidase F (PNGase-F) to remove the glycans, its molecular mass decreased to that of the mutant M4 (Fig. 3B) . The band intensities of the modified H6HA1 proteins were also substantially reduced, because they were more sensitive to proteolytic attack in the absence of protection from glycans. A schematic of the glycosylation of HA1 presented in Fig. 3C . A previous study reported that the glycan in insect cells comprised six monosaccharides, and exhibited a molecular mass of approximately 1.1 kDa (Shi and Jarvis, 2007) .

To optimize recombinant H6HA1-His protein production, two insect cell lines, Sf21 (Fig. 4) and High Five ( Supplementary Fig.  S3 ), were tested for baculovirus infection.

By contrast, the culture medium exhibited a higher concentration of the expressed protein, which was separated clearly from the EGFP using an affinity column (Fig. 4C ). An inconsistency between the HA1 amounts (imidazole elutions) determined by anti-HA and anti-His antibodies ( Fig. 4B and C) was identified.

The system produced the influenza H6HA1-His recombinant protein, and EGFP was used as a visible reporter (Fig. 1B) . The signal peptide GP67sp facilitated the secretion of H6HA1-His into a medium of insect cell culture, which was then purified using a nickel column (Fig. 2) . The H6HA1-His protein produced was determined to be glycosylated based on its molecular mass as indicated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A) . SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the protein glycosylation in this expression system was relatively complete in terms of glycan sites. We estimated that each expressed HA1 protein involved three to four glycans, and each glycan exhibited a molecular mass of approximately 1 kDa. Although these glycans were produced in insect cells rather than mammalian cells, the expressed HA1 protein served as an effective subunit vaccine for immunizing mice. The mice immunized with the vaccine generated relatively high-titer antisera against the virus prepared from embryonated SPF eggs (Fig. 7) . The antisera in the mice were specific to the H6 subtype of AIV but did not recognize the H5 subtype. However, the recombinant HA1 exhibited no hemagglutination activity (data not shown), which may have been due to the absence of the HA2 domain in complete HA. The baculovirus was also used to infect S. litura larvae (Fig. 5) . Hemolymph from the infected larvae was collected, and the expressed protein was purified using a general purification procedure. On the gel filtration elution pattern, the native H6HA1-His protein was expressed as a monomer with a molecular mass of 35 kDa, along with a high-molecular-mass polymeric form (Fig. 6A) . On the basis of the distribution of the bands revealed by anti-HA antibody on the Western blot (Fig. 6B) , we speculated that the polymeric form may have been a trimer. The earliest band was eluted at fraction number 33, corresponding to a molecular mass of approximately 100 kDa, nearly three-fold that of the monomer (35 kDa). Previous studies reported that the native HA on the viral particle comprises three identical monomers (Gamblin and Skehel, 2010; Zhu et al., 2013) , and may show a modulation of the monomer-trimer equilibrium (Seok et al., 2017) . In this study, although the expressed protein contained only the HA1 fragment of HA, the expression of this fragment was sufficient for formation of a trimer. The molecular mass of the monomer estimated using gel filtration (35 kDa) was smaller than that estimated using SDS-PAGE (40 kDa). Accordingly, we considered SDS-PAGE to be more precise than gel filtration for determining the subunit molecular mass of the protein.",

Larval hemolymph was collected, and H6HA1-His was detected by Western blotting using anti-HA (B) or anti-His (C). The H6HA1-His protein from the infected Sf-21 cell was used as the positive control (P), and the normal hemolymph from the blank larva was used as the negative control (N). efficient platform for stimulating the expressing of recombinant HA1 in insect cells and larvae. In the experiment, a large proportion of the expressed protein was secreted into the culture medium and could be harvested directly, avoiding contamination from cytosolic proteases. The H6HA1-His produced in E. coli exhibited extensive degradation (Fig. 7B , lane b) compared with that from the insect cells (Fig. 7B, lane  a) . In addition, the visible reporter EGFP indicated the appropriate time for cell harvest, ensuring that harvest was performed at the time of highest expression of the recombinant protein and minimizing the disruption of host cells. In this study, the cells were harvested 3 days after infection. The expressed viral protein was glycosylated and was assembled in a trimeric form (Fig. 6 ) similar to that of the native viral protein. This similarity might explain why the expressed H6HA1-His protein served as an effective subunit vaccine (Fig. 7) . A previous study indicated that glycosylation in a baculovirus expression system was not as effective as that in mammal cells, but that the protein folding and expression level were equal to or better than those from the prokaryotic system (Harrison and Jarvis, 2006) . The baculovirus expression system presented in this study may serve as an effective vector to construct virus-like particles for vaccine production. Although this system expressed H6HA1-His protein and secreted into the medium efficiently, we found that it was not successful in producing the spike protein (S1) of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Du et al., 2017) . The secretion of S1 was poor, even though it was expressed at adequate level in the cell (data not shown). The system should be used to test all proteins individually for their expression and secretion by using proper promotor or signal peptides.",

S. litura is an agricultural pest, and a large population is easy to raise for the collection of hemolymph. However, hemolymph is a complex mixture of biological molecules that may contaminate the expressed protein. Purification was required to isolate the expressed protein; in this study, ammonium sulfate fractionation, gel filtration, and a nickel affinity column were used for this purification process. In future research, we will replace the His-tag with another type of affinity tag, because the hemocyanin in hemolymph may bind to the nickel column and interfere with the affinity purification of the H6HA1-His protein. Additionally, this construct was not protected by the polyhedral baculovirus protein, feeding could not be used to infect larvae. Instead, we manually injected the baculovirus into the midgut of the larvae. The survival rate of the larvae after the injection was only 70%, and half of the surviving larvae produced the recombinant protein.

A control experiment was performed in which mice were immunized mice with PBS (A1). (B) The antiserum at the fifth booster shoot was further used to detect antigens from various sources: H6HA1-His isolated from insect cells (a) or E. coli (b); H6HA1 viral protein from the H6 subtype of AIV (c and d); and the H5 subtype (e and f).
