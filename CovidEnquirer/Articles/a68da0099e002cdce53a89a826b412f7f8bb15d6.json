            "text": "Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN), originally described in 1956, is a unique familial, chronic renal disease encountered with a high-prevalence rate in Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The most prominent features of the disease are its endemic nature, longincubation period, familial clustering of the disease and an unusually high incidence of associated upper urothelial cancer (UUC). There are no clear-cut data on BEN incidence and prevalence, since the studies carried out in different endemic areas yielded contradictory information. In spite of intermittent variations, the incidence of new cases has remained stable over time. It has been estimated that almost 100 000 people are at risk of BEN, whereas 25 000 have the disease. The clinical signs and symptoms of BEN are non-specific and often remain unrecognized for years. There are no pathognomonic diagnostic features of BEN, but the set of epidemiological, clinical and biochemical data along with the pattern of pathologic injury in the absence of any other renal diseases are highly suggestive of this entity. Although the aetiology has been extensively studied, fostering the publication of various hypotheses, only one of them has provided conclusive evidence related to the aetiology of BEN. Studies conducted over the past decade have provided particularly strong arguments that BEN and UUC are caused by chronic poisoning with aristolochic acids (AAs). In light of these later studies, one can raise the question whether AAs could be responsible for previously and currently widespread unrecognized global renal disease and UUC.",

            "text": "Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN) is a familial, slowly progressive, chronic renal disease with insidious onset in the fifth decade of life and terminal renal failure in the sixth or seventh decade. The occurrence of BEN has been recorded with a high prevalence rate in Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia ( Figure 1 ). The first cases were described in 1956 in Bulgaria, where Tanchev et al. [1] published the first detailed clinical description of the new entity. A year later, a renal disease with almost identical clinical and epidemiological characteristics was reported in Yugoslavia (Serbia) [2] . In 1961, it was found that a similar nephropathy was also prevalent in Romania [3] . The most prominent features of the disease are its endemic nature, the long latent period before development of the disease, familial clustering of the disease and the remarkably high incidence of upper urothelial cancer (UUC) associated with BEN or occurring in the population at risk [4] [5] [6] . No cases have been documented in children or adolescents. The aetiology of BEN has been the subject of many published studies resulting in the generation of several hypotheses. Although data published on these various hypotheses have presented some indication of their relevance to the aetiology of BEN, only one of them, dealing with chronic aristolochic acid (AA) poisoning, has provided conclusive evidence related to the aetiology of BEN and its clinical characteristics.",

Similarly, in another endemic area, a decreasing incidence over time was found during a follow-up period spanning the time period 1978 to 1997 [9] .",

Blood pressure is usually normal, although in the advanced phase it may be elevated but at a lower incidence than in other forms of CKD. Intermittent proteinuria of the tubular type may be found early while in the uraemic phase, it becomes permanent. The urinary sediment shows sparse white and red blood cells. In the early stages of BEN, the loss of urine concentration capacity precedes the decline in the glomerular filtration rate [15] [16] [17] . Serum proteins and immunoglobulins are unchanged.",

Extreme kidney atrophy has been proposed as a criterion for the clinical diagnosis of BEN. Some studies suggest that the smallest kidneys are found in advanced stages of BEN, whereas others have reported that this occurs in the earlier stages. In BEN patients, it has been found that the dimensions of the kidneys depend on the parental status and the age of offspring. In the offspring of a mother with BEN, ultrasound measurements of the kidney cortex thickness seem to portend a prognostic value [19] . In conclusion, adult offspring in BEN families can be characterized by shorter kidney length and an increased excretion of albumin, total protein and \u03b22microglobulin, in particular, when the mother had BEN [19, 20] .",

It refers to the use of the plant in aiding childbirth and was prescribed by the Greeks to women following delivery to facilitate a resuming of their periods. The species name, 'Clematitis' derives from the Greek 'klema' for tendril, the growth form of this species of Aristolochia. The English name 'birthwort' likewise refers to the plant's use as an aid to birth [31] . Although herbal drugs derived from Aristolochia spp. have been known since antiquity and were used in obstetrics and in the treatment of snake bites (Rosenmund and Reichstein, 1943) [32] in 1981, the use of Aristolochia spp. was forbidden in many countries due to possible carcinogenic effects. Peters and Hedwall in 1962 indicated that AA was known to be nephrotoxic in the rabbit as early as in 1892, in the horse in 1893 and in the rabbit and the mouse in 1958 [33] .",

He speculated that human exposure to a toxic component of Aristolochia might occur through ingestion of bread prepared from flour derived from contaminated grain. He demonstrated in rabbit models that flour prepared from A. clematitis seeds induced a nephropathy, which resembled the findings in BEN. Ivi\u0107 even proved the carcinogenetic potential of the plant as rats developed sarcomas of the skin at the site of injection of aqueous extracts of A. clematitis [35] . Ivi\u0107 concluded that on the basis of geographical, epidemiological and laboratory investigations, there are strong arguments suggesting that endemic nephropathy is essentially caused by chronic poisoning with the seeds of A. clematitis [34] . Although his classic paper presented the brilliant examples of drawing correct conclusions regarding the aetiology of a complex human disease from simple but well thought out experimental observations, this clever hypothesis has never been adequately pursued. His well-documented results attracted more interest from the scientific community many years later.",

A study of the incidence of UUC and urinary bladder tumours (UBTs) associated with BEN in the 30-year followup revealed a total of 575 urothelial neoplasms during the 10-year period, 1989-1998, compared with 659 in the period 1969-1988. Remarkably, UUC had an 11.2-fold higher incidence in endemic than in non-endemic areas. However, this was far less than in the period 1969-1988, when UUC was 57.1 times more frequent. UBT were 2.3 times more frequent in endemic than in non-endemic areas, but 11.9 times more frequent in the previous period 1969-1988 [61] .

The familial clustering of the disease was indicative of the role of a hereditary predisposition in the aetiology of BEN and prompted many genetic investigations. The hypothesis implicating the multifactorial nature of the BEN aetiology assumes that genetic factors create a predisposition to BEN [76] . The combined action of genetic and environmental factors may result in the development and determination of clinical and epidemiological characteristics and the progression of the disease. This hypothesis was substantiated by family investigations in Bulgarian patients with BEN. A study by Toncheva et al. in 4077 subjects from 417 families affected with BEN led to the conclusion that all patients with BEN belong to certain families [77] . Even residents from nonendemic villages diagnosed to have BEN were found to be members of BEN families that had migrated from their birthplaces. Furthermore, some epidemiological characteristics of BEN are indicative of the involvement of genetic disorders, i.e. the proportion of the affected offspring increases in accordance with the number of parents affected. Consequently, the risk of developing BEN is much higher in first-degree than second-degree relatives and decreases substantially in remote relatives [77] .",

Characteristics of BEN No. 3 chromosomal anomalies in terms of extremely high frequencies of 3q25 homologue discordance, chromosome breaks at the 3q25 band, structural aberrations affecting the 3q25 band, unusually high frequency of acquired chromosomal aberrations and a family history with 1 or 2 BEN parents were identified in five relatives. It is proposed that they are at a high risk for developing the disease and that a genetic mechanism might be involved in the aetiology of BEN [76] . The additional finding of a specific chromosome marker 3q in BEN was reported, characterized by a discordance in the banding patterns of the long arms, shortening band 3q25, faster fusion of sub-bands q26.1 and q26.3 and lack of differentiation of q24 [89] . Viral disease. In 1975, some evidence of a viral involvement in the aetiology of BEN was published, suggesting that a slow coronavirus infection causes BEN in humans [90] . Data substantiating this hypothesis remained unconvincing. It was more recently documented when some authors were able to detect a novel corona virus, using primary kidney tissue cultures established as explants from tissue obtained at operations from five BEN patients with urinary tract tumours. Four out of the five biopsy specimens on extended culture yielded a coronavirus virus which was cytopathogenic for human fibroblast and Vero cells, but none from the control cultures. It was proposed that the microorganism was a novel coronavirus based on its cross-reactivity with the human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E, as well as a porcine-transmissible gastroenteritis virus [91] .",
