Coping is the thoughts and actions that individuals use to deal with stressful events [11] . People have identified two general coping strategies: one is a problem-focused coping, the purpose is to solve the problem or take action to change the status quo; the other is an emotion-focused coping, which aims to reduce the emotional distress associated with stressful situations [12] . Studies have found that emotions lead to specific coping strategies [13] , and vice versa. Emotions are thought to have motivational properties that motivate certain behaviors or behaviors [13, 14] . For example, fear is related to the desire to evade and protect themselves from incidents, anger leads to desire to attack, disgust leads to desire to expel, and happiness leads to desire to entertain [13, 15] .",

In particular, adults who report more anger and fear prefer to use active-oriented coping strategies such as asking questions, while those who are sad are more likely to use non-active coping strategies such as avoiding or accepting problems [16] . In turn, the successful use of coping strategies will help individuals manage stressful events [11] and reduce negative emotions [12] . However, the direction of the relationship between emotion responses and coping strategies is not clear, and the relationship is not always constant. Some studies have found that the relationship between them is age-specific during SARS [17] . So, the relationship between nurses' coping strategies and emotional response during a major infectious disease such as COVID-19 needs further research to clarify. To our knowledge, there has been no systematic assessment of the effects of COVID-19 on nurses' emotional responses and coping strategies.",
