            "text": "The indoor transmission of airborne particles can spread disease and have health-related and even life-threatening effects on occupants, thus necessitating effective ways to locate indoor particle sources. The identification of particle sources from concentration distributions is a difficult task because particles are often released at a time-varying rate, and particle transport mechanisms are more complex than those of gas. This study proposes an improved multi-robot olfactory search method for locating two types of time-varying indoor particle sources: 1) periodic sources such as occupants' respiratory activities and 2) decaying sources such as laboratory leaky containers with hazardous chemicals. The method considers both particle concentrations and indoor air velocities by including an upwind term in the standard particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, preventing robots from becoming trapped into a local optimum, which occurs when using other algorithms. We also considered two ventilation types (mixing ventilation and displacement ventilation) when particles are emitted from different source types, comprising four scenarios. For each scenario, particle concentration and air velocity were simulated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and then fed to the PSO algorithm for source localization. In addition, we validated the CFD approach for one scenario by comparing experimental data (e.g., velocities and particle concentrations) under laboratory settings. The results showed that the proposed method can locate the two types of particle sources within approximately 55 s, and the success rates of source localization exceeding 96%, which is a much higher level than levels achieved from the standard PSO and wind utilization II algorithms.",

Infectious respiratory droplets or droplet nuclei exhaled from inflected occupants can serve as pathogen carriers [3] . Virus-laden aerosol particles like those containing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1-A influenza can be transported through indoor space (e.g., air cabins) by human respiratory activities. Additionally, the release of toxic chemicals and bio-aerosols in a laboratory threatens personnel health, and these contaminants must be identified in a timely manner. Extreme cases may involve the use of biochemical weapons or terrorist attacks (e.g., the Tokyo subway sarin attack of 1995) [4] . The mitigation of adverse effects of the transport of infectious bio-aerosols or the release of hazardous airborne particles necessitates effective approaches to indoor source localization.",

A forward model stores all potential release scenarios that are pre-simulated as a database, and then a potential indoor source can be identified by matching the pre-simulated and measured concentrations from an efficient search algorithm such as the Bayesian probability algorithm [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] or optimization algorithm [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . contrast, a backward model obtains source locations and other characteristics by reversely solving transport equations for indoor pollutants. The reverse simulation often involves measuring concentrations from a few locations as boundary or initial conditions. Typical approaches include the quasi-reversibility method [15, 16] , pseudo-reversibility method [17] , regularization method [18, 19] and probabilitybased inverse method [20] [21] [22] [23] . A more detailed review is given in Refs. [24, 25] . In practical applications, the fixed-sensor network method must install sensors in advance, limiting the application scope of this type of method. Under most emergency conditions (e.g., accidents and intentional attacks), it is infeasible to quickly install enough sensors to identify a given source, and the sensor network can be easily damaged. In addition, this type of method depends on the computing of numerical models (e.g., computational fluid dynamics (CFD) or multi-zone models) requiring the use of environmental information (e.g., building sizes, obstacles and ventilation systems).",

In principle, these three subtasks can be conducted by directly using sensor readings without solving complex transport equations. Sensors for a contaminant of interest are often used with a mobile platform using a single robot or multiple robots.

These behaviors significantly differ from those of gaseous contaminants and render particle transport more complex, potentially complicating source localization efforts [35] .

In addition, the drift flux model assumes that particle movements cannot affect turbulence. To make these assumptions, the computational element should contain enough particles for reasonable statistical calculations, particles should fall significantly below the Kolmogorov micro scale of the airflow field, and particle phase volumes should be lower. These assumptions were found to be applicable to indoor particle simulations by Holmberg and Li [47] . For discretization schemes, PRESTO! and second-order upwind discretization were applied to discretize pressure levels and all other variables, and the SIMPLE scheme was used for pressure and velocity coupling. Residual values of energy and other variables were set to less than 10 \u22126 and 10 \u22124 , respectively. A Boussinesq approximation was used to calculate buoyancy effects of the manikins. In our previous study [38] , grids of 247,000, 500,000, and 1,000,000 were used to conduct a grid-independence test of the RANS model, and 500,000 grids proved sufficient for this simulation based on grid convergence index calculations [49] . The time step size was set at 0.05 s, and the data sampling period was set to 300 s, covering the experimental sampling period. The inner surface temperature of the chamber was also controlled to mimic thermal boundaries such as walls and windows. The boundary conditions of walls and manikins were set as heat fluxes, and further information on the boundary settings used can be found in Liu and Novoselac [38] . Fig. 5 shows a schematic of the experimental chamber [38] , which was identical to the mixing ventilation model used in our case study ( Fig. 3 (a) ). Mono-dispersed 2.5 \u03bcm particles generated by latex with a density of 1050 kg/m 3 were released from a transient source in the ventilation duct. The injection period was set to 100 s. The injection period was set to 100 s. Optical particle counters were used to measure particle concentrations, and omni-directional low-velocity anemometers were used to measure air velocities. Table 2 presents the specifications of the instruments. Particle transmission experiments were repeated three times to calculate the standard deviation. Further information can be found in a previous publication [38] . Fig. 6 quantitatively compares velocities measured with height between the CFD simulations and measurements, and the positions of L1-L6 are shown in Fig. 5 . Differences in the air movement observed were not significant due to mixing effects. A meaningful discrepancy was found between simulation and measurement results at L5-L6 at lower levels (below 0.6 m). Fig. 7 presents the predicted dimensionless particle concentration profiles of P1-P3 shown in Fig. 5 . For P2 and P3, the simulation results agree well with the experimental data, and concentration values decreased after the first 100 s of release. However, for P1, a significant discrepancy was found because P1 was positioned in the recirculation region, and concentration fluctuations were significant. The above validation shows that the URANS model can generate reasonable flow distributions and that the Eulerian drift flux model can predict particle dispersion with acceptable accuracy. Therefore, these models can be used to test and evaluate the presented source localization method. For mixing ventilation ( Fig. 8 (a) ), air was supplied from the inlet and was sent through the room along the ceiling. Swirling airflow was generated between the wall and the cylindrical manikins, and a thermal plume was found around the manikins. Velocity magnitudes almost fell below 0.3 m/s. For displacement ventilation ( Fig. 8 (b) ), velocity magnitudes were much lower than those of mixing ventilation because an in-plane diffuser was not used. In Fig. 8 (b) a thermal plume is also observable around the manikins. Fig. 9 shows particle distributions of the four release scenarios (MP, MD, DP, and DP (Table 1) ) measured 50 s after the particles were released. For scenario MP, an isolated local extremum area of particles appeared far from the particle source and a small local extremum area appeared around the source. For scenarios MD and DP, only a large local extremum area of particles appeared around the particle source. For scenario DD, the local extremum area of particles around the source decreased in size compared to those observed for scenarios MD and DP. In addition, no isolated local extremum area formed, which may have facilitated mobile robot source locating.",

For each release scenario, the maximum speed of each robot and the concentration threshold c min for plume identification were set as 0.3 m/s and 50 \u03bcg/m 3 according to the model geometry and the release rate of the potential particle source, respectively. Note that the maximum speed and concentration threshold can be set depending on the specific robot, sensor and environment used. Additionally, we assumed that source localization efforts were successful when the distance between the source location determined by the robots and the actual location differed by within 0.5 m. As a particle source itself is of a certain size, it is unrealistic to determine the central position of such a source without error.

Note that the location of each robot represents the positioning of the equipped sensor. Six robots (R1-R6) were randomly initialized in the room after particles were released for 20 s (Fig. 10 (a) and (f)). After 3 s of movement according to the random search strategy, robot R6 found the plume first ( Fig. 10 (b) and (g)). Then, the robots used the improved PSO algorithm to track the plume and moved toward the local extremum area with higher particle concentrations (Fig. 10 (c) and (h)), and the robots then left this area and approached the source (Fig. 10 (d) and (i) ). Finally, the robots successfully found the source 67 s after the particles were released (Fig. 10 (e) and (j) ). The source locating process shown in Fig. 10 is drawn from an animation provided in the supplementary files. Fig. 11 illustrates the movement of robots R1-R6 under scenario MP. First, all of the robots moved randomly according to the random search strategy until the plume was found by R6 ( Fig. 11 (b) ). The robots then adjusted their velocities by using the improved PSO algorithm to track the plume and approached the area of higher particle concentrations and the source (Fig. 11 (a) ). Finally, the robots stopped near the periodic source after leaving the local extremum area. Live trajectories of robots R1-R6 shown in Fig. 11 are presented as animations in the supplementary files.",

The higher SR found for displacement ventilation may be attributed to the fact that airflows of displacement ventilation are more uniform than those of mixing ventilation (Fig. 8) . As is shown in Fig. 12 (b), the localization time of each scenario (approximately 55 s) shows no obvious differences. The maximum average localization period of scenario MD is the longest (56.8 s) and only 14% longer than that of scenario DD with the shortest average localization period (49.7 s). In addition, the average localization period and standard deviation of scenario DP are slightly greater than those of scenario MP.

To employ the same benchmarks of comparison, the same plume finding strategies, obstacle avoidance algorithms and other settings (e.g., the number and maximum speed of robots used) were applied across the three methods. Fig. 13 shows statistical results for the three methods. The SR generated from the IPSO method is significantly greater than values generated from the SPSO and WUII methods for each release scenario ( Fig. 13 (a) ). The maximum SR generated from both the SPSO and WUII methods for scenario DD was measured as 44% while the minimum SR values generated from these methods for scenario MP are 24% and 20%, respectively. These results indicate that the SPSO and WUII methods are not suited to practical conditions under which the release rate of a particle source changes with time. For these cases, the SPSO and WUII methods entrapped the robots within the local extremum area so that they could not successfully locate the source. In contrast, the minimum SR of the proposed IPSO method was measured as greater than 96%. Therefore, the IPSO method is more promising than the other two tested methods for applying to practical situations because the IPSO method can enhance robot search capacities by using the upwind term and guiding robots to leave the local extremum area until they find the source (Fig. 10) .",

When a method cannot successfully locate a source, the localization period is meaningless. From this perspective, the proposed IPSO method still presents obvious advantages over the SPSO and WUII methods due to its much higher SR (Fig. 13 (b) ). Particle sources are widely found in indoor environments with timevarying release rates (e.g., pathogen droplets emitted by infected people or the leakage or malicious release of particles from a container). This work presents a novel multi-robot active olfactory method for rapidly locating time-varying particle sources and assesses the proposed method under a variety of indoor release scenarios.
