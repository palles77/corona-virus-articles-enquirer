As additional point mutations are necessary for further expansions, epistasis among host range mutations can potentially affect the mutational neighborhood and frequency of niche expansion. We mapped the mutational neighborhood of host range expansion using three genotypes of the dsRNA bacteriophage phi6 (wildtype and two isogenic host range mutants) on the novel host Pseudomonas syringae pv. atrofaciens (PA). Sanger sequencing of fifty PA mutant clones for each genotype and population Illumina sequencing both revealed the same high frequency mutations allowing infection of PA. Wildtype phi6 had at least nine different ways of mutating to enter the novel host, eight of which are in p3 (host attachment protein gene), and 13/50 clones had unchanged p3 genes. However, the two isogenic mutants had dramatically restricted neighborhoods: only one or two mutations, all in p3. Deep sequencing revealed that wildtype clones without mutations in p3 likely had changes in p12 (morphogenic protein), a region that was not polymorphic for the two isogenic host range mutants. Sanger sequencing confirmed that 10/13 of the wildtype phi6 clones had nonsynonymous mutations in p12 and two others had point mutations in p9 and p5 -none of these genes had previously been associated with host range expansion in phi6. We demonstrate, for the first time, epistatic constraint in an RNA virus due to host range mutations themselves, which has implications for models of serial host range expansion.",

Similarly, canine parvovirus jumped from infecting cats to raccoons and then jumped again to infect dogs (20) . Influenza strains have also serially shifted hosts (e.g., H3N8 originated from avian hosts infecting horses, and then shifting to dogs (21) ). This kind of serial emergence allows for the possibility of host range mutations themselves to play a significant role in shaping the landscape of further emergence -one of the legacies of previous host use (7, 22) .

However, all previous studies have exclusively looked at a wildtype genotype, replicating in its reservoir host, instead of investigating the interactions of multiple host range mutations during frequent host shifting, or serial emergence. In this study, we mapped the host range mutational neighborhoods of wildtype phi6 and two isogenic host range mutants (E8G in P3; G515S in P3) emerging in novel host P. syringae pv. atrofaciens (PA). Significant epistatic constraint was observed with both host range mutants in clonal and Illumina sequencing -only one or two mutations were found that allowed infection of PA. These mutations were a subset of the large mutational neighborhood of PA host range mutations available to wildtype phi6. Additionally, we have identified host range associated genes other than the canonical site of host range mutations, three genes on the Small segment, not previously implicated in host-shifting. Our work supports using deep sequencing to map mutational neighborhoods in future studies, though both deep sequencing and the more labor-intensive characterization of clones complemented each other. This work provides a panoramic view of host range mutational neighborhoods in phi6, while demonstrating a significant constraint imposed by host range mutation in a fast-evolving RNA virus.",

Fifty host range mutant plaques were isolated for each of the three genotypes (phi6-WT, phi6-E8G and phi6-G515S; Table 1 ) and their p3 genes for the phi6 attachment protein were Sanger sequenced. We only sequenced the p3 gene because P3 is the only highly accessible protein on the outside of the virion (33) and the only protein associated with phi6 host range in all previous studies (5, 23, 24) . Thirty-five out of the fifty sequenced phi6-WT p3 sequences had single nonsynonymous mutations (seven unique mutations identified), two had double mutations, and thirteen had no detectable mutations on p3 gene. Forty-eight of the fifty phi6-E8G host range mutants contained one of the two single mutations present in the phi6-WT clones (A133V, S299W), the remaining two clones had double mutations: A133V and an additional nonsynonymous mutation. All 50 phi6-G515S host range mutants had the A133V mutation; 43 as a single mutation, five as double mutants and two as triple mutants. The nonsynonymous mutation A133V was the most frequent in the three tested populations: 24% in phi6-WT isolates, 96% in phi6-E8G isolates, and 100% in phi6-G515S isolates, making this the most prevalent mutation conferring infection of PA. In addition, there was a noticeable drop in diversity of single host range mutations from the phi6-WT population compared to the phi6-E8G and phi6-G515S populations, consistent with epistatic constraint on mutational neighborhood by host range mutations. We have summarized these P3 host range mutational neighborhoods on PA in a two-dimensional schematic ( Figure 1 ). Several published works have investigated the mutational neighborhoods of phi6 p3 during expansion of host range (Table 2) . Two sites were favored by host range expansion events onto P. pseudoalcaligenes and P.syringae pv glyclinea: the 8 th and 554 th amino acid of attachment protein P3 (66/81 and 18/39 of isolated mutants, respectively, (5, 24) ). However, the PA mutational neighborhood does not include these frequent sites of mutation to other hosts. There is some overlap with previous studies, for instance N146S (5) and A133V (23), but this suggests that phi6 may interact differently with host PA during attachment than with other Pseudomonas species or P. syringae pathovars. The absence of host range mutations in p3 for thirteen of the phi6-WT PA isolates was unexpected, since 97% of previously independently isolated host range mutants had nonsynonymous mutations in p3, with no other sites in the phi6 genome identified as causing the expanded host range in the remaining 4/118 (5, 23, 24) . This motivated a more in-depth approach: deep sequencing to map the entire mutational neighborhood.",

All population lysates from before and after PA host range expansion were sequenced. Change in Shannon entropy was calculated to determine the sites that became more or less variable after overnight growth on PA. The signals of increased variation in the p3 gene matched Sanger sequencing results; all single mutations identified in the three genotypes underwent noticeable entropy change after gaining PA host range ( Figure 2 ). We also found several sites in P3 that may have evaded detection by clonal sampling; including amino acid 247 of phi6-WT and amino acid 35 of phi6-G515S. Deep sequencing also revealed sites of high entropy change in other genes in phi6-WT that could be additional genes controlling host range, and suggesting targets for sequencing in the phi6-WT clones that did not contain p3 mutations (Figure 3, 4) . Our results suggested that non-structural protein genes p12 (encoding the morphogenic protein) and p9 (encoding the major membrane protein) were the most probable sites of additional host range mutations; both genes are involved with viral nucleocapsid vesiculation of the host inner membrane (34, 35) . Results from deep sequencing the p3 gene and from the entire genome further confirmed the constrained neighborhood of host range mutants phi6-E8G and phi6-G515S revealing fewer possibilities for PA mutations in p3, and none elsewhere in the genome.",

However, when phi6-E8G and phi6-G515S gained the A133V mutation, each significantly increased their PP fitness on PP (Tukey's HSD adjusted p= 0.000011, 0.011, respectively). K144R, on the other hand, was not beneficial in two genotypes on the PP host (p< 0.005).",

The constraining effects of larger and smaller beneficial mutational neighborhoods were elegantly demonstrated in phi6 by Burch and Chao, who noted that the high mutation rate of phi6 was not sufficient to allow constrained genotypes to traverse a rugged fitness landscape (Burch and Chao, 2000) . The ruggedness of viral fitness landscapes has been demonstrated for many viruses including HIV (37), Influenza virus A (39, 40), and Ebola virus (41) , and the phenomenon of mutational neighborhoods constraining evolutionary trajectories has been demostrated in cellular organisms as well (42) (43) (44) . Many of these studies involved prolonged experimental evolution, whereas our study used a very narrow window of lethal selection: a single night's selection on a novel host. Nevertheless, we detected strong epistatic constraint from single amino acid changes, and in an ecologically realistic scenario for an RNA virus.",

The genotypes have differences in mutational supply affected by either the size of the PA mutational neighborhood or population size (or both, (42)). Moderate differences in population size are a concern because phi6-WT was reared on the highly productive host PP and the two mutants were reared on PT, a host on which they are less productive. There are additional \"maternal effects\" on phi6 fitness due to host used to generate a high titer lysate, which could cause further differences in PA plaquing efficiency among phi6 strains grown on different hosts (23) . However, the library preparation for Illumina sequencing involved the same amount of RNA, enforcing a similar population size of genomes sampled by sequencing. Phi6-WT had double the number of SNPs in high titer lysates in deep sequencing following double-plaque purification, demonstrating that constrained mutational neighborhood for the two host range mutant genotypes played a large role in the reduced evolvability on PA.",

If these mutants were allowed to evolve further (on the original host or within their novel host range), it is difficult to predict if their evolved descendants would face identical constraints when infecting the PA host -which more accurately reflects the serial host jumping we have observed for mammalian viruses (). It is easy to imagine that a phi6 P3 protein, somewhat destabilized by the addition of one host range mutation, cannot tolerate further destabilization while retaining its structure and function. The fitness benefits of A133V on the original host (PP) for both phi6-E8G and phi6-G515S may indicate that this is one of few (or the only) PA host range mutation in P3 that improves the mutants' P3 structure and function.

            "text": "While the Small segment has not previously been associated with host range, one of our PA host range mutations (P12:F176L) was previously observed in a phi6 evolution experiment on a different novel host (49) . Changes in the Small segment-encoded protein P5 are known to affect phi6 thermal niche expansion (50) , but this is the first time that membrane protein P9, enveloped lytic protein P5 and membrane morphogenic protein P12 (which is not found within the virion) were associated with host range. Across diverse viruses it is not uncommon for a variety of proteins in the envelope (such as P9) to interact with host receptor proteins (6, 51) . It is more rare for non-structural genes that are not on the exterior of the virion to be a host range determinant, but there are examples of this: PB2 of avian influenza (52, 53) and in picornaviruses (54, 55) . P5 plays a role in both phi6 entry and egress: copies of this muralytic enzyme underneath the lipid coat bore through the cell wall to allow phi6 to re-envelop itself with the host's cytoplasmic membrane, and it is used to lyse host cells after sufficient replication (56) (57) (58) . P12, however, is solely associated with egress from cells (forming membranes from the host cytoplasmic membrane around completed nucleocapsids) and is not detected in phi6 virions (35, 59) . P12 was a hotspot of change in entropy for phi6-WT and 10 of the 13 clones that did not have a mutation in P3 had one of five nonsynonymous mutations in P12, which strongly suggests that this non-structural protein has a role in host range expansion to PA. Given our current understanding of P12's role in the phi6 life cycle (34) , this would require phi6-WT to be able to attach and infect PA but fail to show its infection through a plaque assay -and then mutations in a number of genes could boost the infectivity of phi6 to cause successful plaque formation. As phage host range is a difficult and debated phenotype to measure (60) , and plaque formation is known to be affected by many genetic and environmental factors (61) , this could well be the scenario for phi6-WT on hosts closely related to its original host PP, which express the same attachment site: the type IV pilus (62) . It is known that DNA phage can attach to more hosts than they can productively infect, often due to successful host defense mechanisms such as CRISPR-Cas, restriction endonucleases and suicide of the infected cell prior to phage maturation (63); our RNA phage which are not known to trigger abortive infection or be susceptible to these defenses may still enter hosts they cannot productively exit. This suggests interesting follow up experiments with phi6-WT and hosts considered outside of its current host range. While spot plating is considered a sensitive method for detecting phage host range (64), lack of visible plaques does not definitively mean that phage cannot productively infect a given host at a low level or at a slow pace (65) . It further suggests some of the host range mutation observed here may be better categorized as mutations that aid in spread among novel hosts rather than the attachment mutations that allow for a spillover infection, which are often considered separate steps in the emergence of a virus on a novel host (66) . On a practical level, one or more of the PA-host range associated mutations in p12, p9 or p5 may prove useful as a Small segment marker for genetic crosses in phi6. The existing mutational markers on the Small segment are an easily reverted temperature sensitivity and an unstable genetic insertion (67, 68) .",

Phi6 host range mutants without identifiable P3 mutations have been isolated in the past, but this is the first report of phi6 without any identified mutation from its immediate ancestor with a different host range. We can only speculate on the molecular processes underlying this plaquing -perhaps the match of lipid coats from those virions produced on PA have a higher infectivity on PA than those grown on PP (or other hosts, (23) ).",

However, when determining population diversity structure, many studies still use cloning for isolate sequencing, and examining chromatograms to describe nucleotide polymorphism (74) (75) (76) . Increasingly, studies have exclusively used deep-sequencing for population SNP detection (77, 78) . In this study, both clonal sequencing and population deep sequencing had merits and shortcomings. Clonal mapping of mutational neighborhoods with 50 clones involved relatively small sample sizes but allowed unambiguous identification of single, double, and triple mutant combinations. Illumina sequencing of populations provided a more reassuringly complete picture of the mutational neighborhood -highly consistent with that of the clonal sequencing -but it might recover hitchhiking mutations that might not be responsible for the phenotype of interest, and cannot assign combinations of mutations to a single genome. For instance, more sophisticated approaches would be required to determine that the phi6 strains with Small segment mutations did not also have one or more of the prevalent p3 mutations, since these unconnected chromosomes could not become linked with longer sequencing reads. An additional durable problem is in haplotype determination. Population genetic analyses require a firm assessment of haplotypes in the population, and although many software programs are available for haplotype prediction, these programs were validated on shorter genomic regions and performed poorly on the tripartite 13kb phi6 genome, and accuracy depends heavily on read length, which we were unable to provide with 150bp Illumina single-end reads (79) .",

However, we found we could not rely on entropy signals as estimates for mutations frequency or abundance. Although the top three most frequently observed P3 mutations in phi6-WT showed the largest change in entropy, this pattern does not apply to other observed host range mutations (e.g. phi6-WT P3: position 140, phi6-G515S P3: position 35, phi6-WT P9: position 8). Population deep sequencing provided an excellent snapshot of the mutational neighborhood, but it prevents many downstream analyses (including any further experimentation with clones of interest). However, it is cheaper and faster than clonal isolation and will serve the needs of many researchers, especially in studies of host range mutations for emerging disease surveillance. (24)). ",
