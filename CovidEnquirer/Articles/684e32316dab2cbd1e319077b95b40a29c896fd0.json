Also, feeder pigs from one farrowing unit end up in several finishing units. Transportation distances between farrowing units and finishing units are kept as short as possible to reduce costs. It can be speculated that the proportion of infected herds (e.g. dysentery, enzootic pneumonia, mange, erysipelas and atrophic rhinitis) in farrowing units of certain supply districts of LSO is greater than that of other areas.

Reviewing these data, it seemed evident that erysipelas and mange were common in the LSO area. Clinical cases of swine dysentery, swine enzootic pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma hyopneurnoniae (M.hyo) and pleuropneumonia caused by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (A.pleur) seemed to be rare. A few dozen outbreaks of these diseases were reported annually but there was no information as to whether these cases had been diagnosed in farrowing or in finishing units. Only two cases of atrophic rhinitis (AR) were reported in southwestern Finland in 1990 (Anonymous, 1991 ) . No detailed information of prophylactic treatments (medications or vaccinations) was available.",

Healthy carriers (30-50% of pigs) are the most important reservoir of erysipelas. The causal agent can survive in swine feces for 1-6 months. Thus, the risk of finishing units becoming permanently infected with erysipelas is high. Erysipelas has been reported to be the major infectious agent in non-suppurative arthritis in pigs (Johnston et al., 1987 ) . Erysipelas poses a risk for human health because arthritis is not necessarily detected in meat inspection (Cross and Edwards, 1981 ) . Arthritis is the most important reason for partial carcass condemnations in LSO . Erysipelas might explain a relatively high percentage of arthritis in LSO. However, it cannot explain the geographical variation in condemnations owing to its common appearance throughout the LSO area. Dysentery was rarely diagnosed in farrowing units. Both herds in which it was found had previous outbreaks of dysentery recorded by the LSO Animal Health Service. Delivery of the feeder pigs from those herds was controlled to avoid the disease being spread to several finishing units. Dysentery has been successfully controlled in LSO by earlier projects and is no longer considered to be of economic importance in this area (Tuovinen, 1992 ) . The present study was in agreement with earlier findings.",

Because of a low prevalence of M.hyo-positive samples it is possible that some herds were misclassified because of false positive or false negative test results. Exact figures of sensitivity or specificity of the ELISA for M.hyo are not available because there is no gold standard for the test. Bommeli ( 1986 ) assumed a very high sensitivity and specificity for the test. In his trials, the sera of pigs kept under specific pathogen free conditions were always negative, and all sera tested 3-50 weeks after inoculation by M. hyopneumoniae were always positive. Sorensen et al. ( 1992 ) reported 93% sensitivity, 96% specificity, 99.8% negative and 39% positive herd predictive value for the ELISA (not by the same laboratory as the test used here). They, however, were not quite sure if the pigs, assumed to be free of M.hyo, really were free of it (no gold standard ). A specificity of 96% would be expected to produce 89 false positives out of 2222 samples, suggesting that the test used in this study had a higher specificity. If any of the positive or suspected samples in this study were true positives (as opposed to false positives) the specificity of the test would have been over 99.4%. The sensitivity and specificity on the herd level depend on the prevalence of the disease within the herd and the sample size taken in each herd. The sample size per herd (22.2 on average) in the present study was relatively large. We assume that on the herd level, false positive results were more probable than false negative.",

Atrophic rhinitis was not of great importance in the LSO area. A.pleur serotype 2 antibodies were very common. Only a few small herds in the northern LSO area were free of A.pleur antibodies. A.pleur seems to be subclinical in farrowing units as no clinical outbreaks were seen. Clinical cases of A.pleur in finishing units are often reported to the Animal Health Service of LSO, most reports coming in late winter to spring. Practically all finishing herds receive feeder pigs from at least one A.pleur-infected farrowing unit with every batch. Eradication of A.pleur from farrowing units is hardly economical because of its high prevalence and because of problems in its eradication (Hunneman, 1986; Agger, 1989; Baekbo et al., 1992) .",

Although this does not prove any causality between M.hyo and PCC, an indirect causality could, however, be theorized because M.hyo is an immunosuppressive disease (Ross, 1992 ) .

Positive herds were larger than negative herds. The proportion of positive and suspected positive samples was under 10% in all positive herds. Of the 2222 colostrum samples tested by ELISA for A.pleur antibodies, 454 (20.4%) were positive, 443 (19.9%) were suspected positive and 1325 (59.6%) were negative (Table 5). Nine herds were negative and 91 herds were positive. Negative herds were smaller (18.2 sows on average) than positive herds (33.3 sows on average). Four of the positive herds had no positive and only one suspected sample. The proportion of positive or suspected samples was, on average, 43% in positive herds. Six of the positive herds had less than 10% of positive or suspected samples.",
