The reference analysis was performed by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detection (HPLC-DAD). Different pretreatments like standard normal variate (SNV), multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), first and second derivative Savitzky-Golay were applied on the spectra to optimize the calibrations. A principal component analysis was performed with both spectroscopic methods to distinguish wild and cultivated samples. Quality parameters obtained for test-set calibration models of ATR-IR spectroscopy (baicalin: standard error of prediction (SEP) \u00bc1.31, ratio performance to deviation (RPD)\u00bc 2.91 and R 2 \u00bc0.88; total baicalein: SEP\u00bc1.02, RPD\u00bc 3.24 and R 2 \u00bc0.89) and NIR spectroscopy (baicalin: SEP\u00bc 1.50, RPD \u00bc2.54 and R 2 \u00bc 0.88; total baicalein: SEP\u00bc 1.19, RPD \u00bc 2.76 and R 2 \u00bc 0.84) demonstrate that both spectroscopic techniques in combination with multivariate analysis are successful tools for the quantification of baicalin and total baicalein in Scutellariae radix, but it was found that ATR-IR spectroscopy provides higher accuracy in the given application. Furthermore it was proved that wild and cultivated samples can be distinguished by ATR-IR.",

            "text": "In various scientific publications the investigations of several pharmacological effects of baicalin and its aglycone baicalein were presented. Both compounds show anti-tumor effects [12, 13] and inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells or induce apoptosis in breast and prostatic cell lines [14] [15] [16] . Furthermore anti-inflammatory [17] , antioxidant and free radical scavenging [18, 19] effects were reported. Additionally, anti-viral effects against HIV [20, 21] and the SARS coronavirus [22] could be observed. Due to the intense industrial phytopharmaceutical use of baicalin and baicalein, it is very important to have a fast and robust tool for the quality control of Scutellariae radix. Therefore, near infrared (NIR) and attenuated-total-reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopic methods for qualitative and quantitative analysis of baicalin and total baicalein content in Scutellariae radix were developed. These methods present a number of advantages over the above mentioned conventional methods. ATR-IR and NIR spectroscopy does not require the use of reactants and almost no sample preparation. The analysis time is relatively short and the techniques are non-destructive.",

Both methods demonstrated their suitability for many applications, but just a few comparative studies can be found in the literature.
