This study addresses the question of whether clinical variability in PRRS results from (a) genetic variation among viral isolates and/or (b) variation in management practices among farms on which isolates are found. Genetic data (open reading frame 5 gene sequences) and data on farm characteristics and associated clinical disease signs were collected for 62 PRRS virus (PRRSV) field isolates, representing 52 farms. Clinical disease signs were interrelated \u00d0 confirming that a true reproductive syndrome exists (involving abortions, infertility in sows, deaths of sows and preweaning mortality).",

This implies that sow death (one of the more-severe manifestations of PRRS) is under genetic influence. Large herd size was a significant risk factor for the death of sows and for respiratory disease in nursery pigs. All-in\u00b1allout management practices in the nursery were protective against reproductive signs in the sow herd. All-in\u00b1all-out management practices in the finishing stages of production were protective against respiratory disease in nursery pigs \u00d0 but were paradoxically associated with an increased risk of infertility in sows. These results suggest that farm-management practices can also influence which PRRS clinical signs are manifested during an outbreak. In general, signs associated with PRRS appear to result from a combination of genetic factors and herd-management characteristics. The relative contributions of these two influences differ depending on the specific clinical sign in question. # : S 0 1 6 7 -5 8 7 7 ( 9 9 ) 0 0 1 0 4 -X",

Intrinsic differences among viral isolates may therefore account for the observed variability in PRRS clinical severity (Halbur et al., 1996; Mengeling et al., 1998) . Alternatively, herd characteristics may play a primary role. Conditions which predispose animals to infection via direct contact (e.g. overcrowding) may facilitate the spread of PRRSV within herds (Albina, 1997; Zimmerman et al., 1997) . The secondary pathogens which may interact with PRRS are as varied as the disease itself (e.g. Streptococcus suis, Haemophilus parasuis, Pasteurella multocida, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, swine influenza virus, porcine respiratory coronavirus; see Done et al., 1996; Van Reeth, 1997) ; the pathogen load on the farm may therefore affect the manner in which PRRS manifests itself clinically.",

This study takes a complimentary epidemiologic approach, making use of a large collection of PRRSV field isolates and associated clinical data from natural outbreaks.

A detailed description of the genetic structure of these isolates is presented elsewhere (Goldberg et al., in press ).

Abortion was correlated with infertility in sows (OR 70; P < 0.001), death of sows (OR 19; P < 0.001) and preweaning mortality (OR 27; P < 0.001). Similarly, infertility in sows was correlated with both death of sows (OR 11; P 0.003) and with preweaning mortality (OR 14; P < 0.001).

Sow death has been described as a hallmark of``atypical'' PRRS (Mengeling et al., 1998) .`A typical'' PRRS is generally considered the most-virulent type of PRRS, because it involves the deaths of immunologically mature animals.

Such data were impossible to collect (again, due to variation in the diagnostic and record keeping protocols of the submitting veterinarians). This was unfortunate, because such data (if collected objectively) would probably account for a large proportion of the clinical variability observed in field outbreaks of PRRS. In terms of the present study, the effect of such unmeasured variation would be to enhance type-II error, by obscuring weak epidemiologic associations. By the same reasoning, the strengths of the associations that were documented were probably underestimated.",

            "text": "Despite these shortcomings, our results suggest that the clinical manifestations of PRRS result from a combination of viral genetics and herd characteristics. Four of seven clinical disease signs (abortion, infertility, death in sows and respiratory disease in nursery pigs) were significantly associated with farm characteristics. Death in sows (among those examined, the clinical manifestation of PRRSV most indicative of high virulence) was the only clinical disease sign significantly associated with genetic similarity of viral isolates. Future studies incorporating larger sample sizes, quantitative data about morbidity and mortality rates, and data on other pathogens present should help clarify the precise nature of these associations. Also useful would be molecular genetic information about which loci are directly responsible for PRRS virulence. Only if such data were available could potential interaction effects between viral genetics and farm characteristics in predicting PRRS clinical severity be examined quantitatively.",
