The total complement of proteins present in a cell or cell type is known as its proteome. As the executive molecules in life, proteins play a crucial role in the physiological and pathophysiological states of a disease. The complicated and changing pattern of protein expression provides important information about the pathologic process taking place in the cells of a particular tissue. Proteomics is the study of various types of proteins and their interactions in a cell. Utilization of this information for the diagnosis and selection of suitable drugs or targets will be very useful.

The core of the SELDI-TOF MS platform is the proteinchip arrays, which have varying chromatographic properties, such as anion exchange, cation exchange, metal affinity, and reverse phase. Superior to the traditional two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, SELDI-TOF MS is capable of detecting proteins that are <10 kD, as well as proteins that are basically charged. The group of proteins in this lower molecular weight range has tremendous biologic significance because they contain cleaved or aberrantly shed proteins/peptides that may reflect concentrated, and purified on the small chemical surface of the proteinchip. A complex mixture of proteins from cells or body fluids can be reduced to sets of proteins with common properties by binding the sample to chips with differing surface chemistries in parallel and in series. After washing to remove unbound proteins, salts, and contaminants, the bound proteins/peptides are ionized by laser and read in a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The resulting spectra provide a multidimensional binding profile on the basis of different types of interactions (Fig. 1 ). ",

Stage one processes the data arrays individually and it consists of noise filtering, baseline subtraction, and peak detection. Stage two analyzes the data arrays collectively and it consists of peak clustering and normalization.

In some cases, univariate analyses alone are sufficient, but biological systems are usually complex and a disease can be caused by multiple factors. In that case, if univariate analyses show individual biomarkers that can be positively identified and linked to a disease pathway, multivariate analyses are needed for proper classification. 2.1 Univariate analysis tools 2.1.1 Mann-Whitney U test: The Mann-Whitney U test is a nonparametric statistical significance test for assessing whether the difference in the medians between two samples of observations is statistically significant. The null hypothesis is that the two samples are drawn from a single population and the two samples must be independently measured.",

The area under ROC curve is equivalent to the Mann-Whitney U test, which tests for the difference in the medians between the scores obtained by the two groups considered in the study. However, any attempt to summarize the ROC curve into a single number results in the loss of information about the pattern of tradeoffs of the particular discriminator algorithm.",

It shows the position of all the cases in an x-y coordinate system. The relationship between interval variables can be identified from scatter graph. A dot in the chart represents the intersection of the data on the x and y axes. One advantage of a scatterplot is that it does not require a user to specify dependent or independent variables, either type of variable can be plotted on either axis. Actually, a scatterplot represents the association (not causation) between two variables. 2.1.4 Box and Whisker plot: Box and Whisker plot is a convenient way to graphically depict the five-number summary, which consists of the smallest nonoutlier observation, lower quartile, median, upper quartile, and the largest nonoutlier observation. Using a boxplot, it is possible to view different types of populations, without any assumption of the statistical distribution. The spaces between the different parts of the box help to indicate variance, skew, and outliers. 2.2 Multivariate analysis tools 2.2.1 Principal components analysis: Principal components analysis (PCA) is used to simplify a dataset by reducing multidimensional datasets to lower dimensions for analysis. The PCA is a linear transformation that transforms the data to a new coordinate system, in which the greatest variance by any projection of the data comes to lie on the first coordinate (called the first principal component), the next greatest variance on the second coordinate, and so on. The PCA can be used for dimensionality reduction in a dataset while retaining the characteristics of the dataset that contribute most to its variance. It keeps the lower-order principal components and ignores the higher-order ones as the lower-order components often contain the most important aspects of the data.",

The results yielded a sensitivity of 100 %, specificity of 95 %, and positive predictive value of 94 % [3] . In another SELDI-TOF MS study, three biomarkers (apolipoprotein A1, a truncated form of transthyretin, and a cleavage fragment of inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4) were identified to detect early stage invasive epithelial ovarian cancer from healthy controls. The sensitivity and specificity of a multivariate model combining the three biomarkers were 83 % and 94 %, respectively [4] . Pathologic states within the prostate might be reflected by changes in serum proteomic patterns. To test this hypothesis, a predicted diagnosis of benign disease or cancer was rendered based on similarity to the discriminating pattern discovered by SELDI-TOF MS [5] . Besides, the SELDI technology discovered a panel of three biomarkers to separate stage 0-I breast cancer patients from noncancer controls. Bootstrap cross-validation demonstrated that a sensitivity of 93 % for cancer patients and a specificity of 91 % for controls were achieved [6] . The SELDI-TOF MS was also adopted to discover differential biomarkers for lung cancer serum, and the results have been filed in the Patent Corporation Treaty by our group. In another study that attempted to discover the specific biomarkers for the detection of lung cancer using SELDI-TOF MS, three protein peaks yielded a sensitivity of 93 % and a specificity of 97 % [7] . Besides, using proteinchip profiling analysis, two isoforms of serum amyloid A (SAA) protein that are useful in the diagnosis of relapse in nasopharyngeal cancer were identified. Monitoring the patients longitudinally for SAA level both by proteinchip and immunoassay showed a dramatic increase in SAA correlated with relapse, and a drastic fall in SAA correlated with response to salvage chemotherapy [8] . Subsequent tandem MS sequencing and immunoaffinity capture assay identified platelet factor-4 as a treatment-associated serum biomarker which might serve to triage patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma for appropriate chemotherapy treatment [9] . When SELDI-TOF MS was carried out to identify differentially expressed proteins in hepatocellular carcinoma serum, complement C3a was found to be elevated in patients with chronic hepatitis C and hepatitis C virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma [10] . On the other hand, the combination of SELDI with bioinformatics tools could help to find new biomarkers and establish patterns with a high sensitivity of 92 % and a specificity of 89 % for the detection of colorectal cancer [11] . Another study identified calgizzarin as a biomarker that could be used to distinguish colorectal carcinoma from colon adenoma. Their results might provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms in the process of tumorgenesis [12] . Benzene is an industrial chemical and environmental contaminant that causes leukemia. SELDI-TOF analysis on the serum proteome of shoe factory workers showed that lowered expression of platelet factor-4 and connective tissue activating peptide-III proteins were potential biomarkers of benzene's early biologic effects, which might play a role in the immunosuppressive effects of benzene [13] .",

Applying proteinchips to monitor the complications of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction could be detected early. The technology could even differentiate ischemic stroke from hemorrhage stroke. The SELDI-TOF MS was used to study the serum and tissue lysate of diabetic rats during different stages of diabetes. Several biomarkers were found to be associated with the disease and its complications, including islet amyloid polypeptide and resistin. These potential biomarkers might provide valuable insight into the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications [18, 19] . The high throughput proteomic approach was adopted to decipher the antidiabetic action of ginsenoside Re (a major component of ginseng) in diabetic rats. C-reactive protein was discovered to have significant decrease corresponding to ginsenoside Re treatment, indicating that the drug could improve diabetes and its complications by alleviating inflammation [20] . For cardiovascular disease, a novel SELDI-TOF MS assay was devised to offer a rapid, cost-effective, and functionally relevant test for timely diagnosis and management of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [21] .",

Most of the current available tumor markers appear too late with low sensitivities and/or low specificities.

The SELDI-TOF platform is a revolutionary approach in proteomic patterns analysis that can be applied at the bedside for discovering protein profiles to distinguish disease and disease-free states with high sensitivity and specificity. Scientists from leading research institutions have taken advantage of SELDI technology to reveal a large number of previously uncharacterized biomarkers for the diagnosis of a wide variety of cancers (Table 1 ).",

A comparatively large amount of experimental fund is thereby required to accomplish modeling and the evaluation of the model. This imposes limitations on the popularity of large-scale studies. On the other hand, even with all its potential, studies must be carefully designed in order to differentiate true differences in protein expression from differences originating from variation in sample collection, variation in experimental conditions, and normal biological variability. The reproducibility, standardization, and feasibility of SELDI-TOF MS need to be addressed before it can become a tool for routine clinical use. To solve these problems, some projects adopt multicenter and/or multistage studies to ensure the consistency of research results, where the cost is enormous. Consequently, many research institutes flinch from SELDI technology for its high implementation costs [27] .",

In recent years, SELDI has interfaced with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, new equipment such as Q-STAR can optimize protein/polypeptide identification. This is of great beneficial to the future development of SELDI proteinchip technology. On the other hand, the study of low abundant proteins in highly complex biological samples is also a major obstacle in proteomic research. Blood possibly constitutes the most complex of all biological samples with a concentration dynamic range from low pg/mL to high mg/mL. A significant portion of the total protein content in serum and plasma comprises just a few high abundant proteins, such as albumin and immunoglobulin. Low abundant proteins make up less than 1 % of protein content. In view of this, the newly developed deep proteome technology and laser capture microdissection are introduced to improve the detection of low abundant proteins on SELDI. The increased capacity allows the enrichment of low abundant proteins from larger sample volumes, proteins that would previously have been swamped by high abundant proteins become visible in the spectra [28] [29] [30] .

            "text": "Many oncologists believe that targeted personalized therapies are the oncotherapy in the future. As solid tumor continues to be viewed as a chronic condition and systemic disease, methods for long-term treatment, with less adverse effects, continue to be investigated. Protein expression profiling is increasingly being used to discover, validate, and characterize biomarkers that can potentially facilitate the combination of therapeutics with diagnostics and will thus play an important role in the development of personalized medicine [31] . However, it is becoming increasingly recognized that the reproducibility and validation, as well as the origin and identity of these biomarkers should be addressed carefully. Discovering valid biological information from SELDI-TOF MS depends on clear experimental design, meticulous sample handling, and sophisticated data processing. If these efforts are made, protein profiling may contribute to the better diagnosis and management of patients, as well as the optimization of treatment [32] .",
