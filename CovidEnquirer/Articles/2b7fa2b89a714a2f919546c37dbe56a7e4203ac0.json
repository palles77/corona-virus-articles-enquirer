            "text": "EV71 possesses a single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 7500 nucleotides, consisting of a single open reading frame (ORF) flanked by 5 0 -untranslated regions (5 0 UTR) and 3 0 -untranslated regions (3 0 UTR). The ORF is expressed as a large polyprotein that can be cleaved into P1, P2, and P3 regions. The P1 region encodes four structural proteins VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4. The P2 and P3 regions encode nonstructural proteins, such as proteases 2A, 2B, and 3CD, responsible for virus replication and virulence. Protease 2A autocatalytically cleaves P1 at its N-terminus and liberates P1 from the nascent polyprotein, 15 while protease 3CD cleaves the P1 precursor into VP1, VP3 and VP0 (VP2 and VP4). These three structural proteins spontaneously assemble and form the crystalline virus-like particles. 16 Though there has been a significant increase in EV71 epidemic activity throughout the Asia-Pacific region, effective antiviral therapies and vaccines have, to-date, not been available. The development of effective vaccines is a top priority in terms of control strategies. Below is an overview of the field of EV71 vaccine preparation to date.",

EV71 has become an increasingly important neurotropic enterovirus in the post-poliomyelitis eradication era. Effective antiviral agents and vaccines against this virus are currently still under development. We reviewed publications on the development of EV71 vaccines in order to provide an overview of the field. Methods: Fifty-five articles on EV71 vaccine development, published from 1974 to 2009, were collected from Sun Yat-sen University library and reviewed. Results: Various types of vaccine have been developed for EV71. In results published to date, all vaccines for EV71 under development appear to elicit an immune response in rodents or in monkeys. According to the established regulatory standards, it may be relatively easy to acquire a license to use the inactivated virus in order to meet the immediate demands for EV71 control . With regard to the attenuated vaccine, it is critical to increase the genetic stability before clinical use, due to the risk of virulent revertants. The virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine, not only conserving the conformational epitopes, but also having no risk of virulent revertants, is another promising vaccine candidate for EV71, but needs further development. The VP1 capsid protein is the backbone antigen protein for developing subunit vaccine and epitope vaccine; these remain viable potential vaccine strategies worthy of further study and development. Conclusions: The conservation of the three-dimensional structure is important for the EV71 inactivated vaccine and VLP vaccine to induce a strong immune response. To develop EV71 vaccines with a high protection efficacy, strategies such as the use of adjuvant, strong promoters, tissue-specific promoters, and addition of mucosal immune adjuvant should be considered.",

Seroepidemiologic studies have indicated that the preexisting neutralizing antibody to EV71 is protective against the severe outcomes of infection. 8, 19 Yu et al. 20 and Wu et al. 21 showed that passive transfer of serum from formalin-inactivated and heatinactivated virus vaccine immunized adult mice, could provide protection against EV71 challenge in neonatal mice; meanwhile, maternal immunization with inactivated EV71 vaccine was able to prolong the survival of suckling mice after EV71 lethal challenge. These results show the value of the inactivated virus vaccine for the effective control of EV71. However, the conservation of the threedimensional structure is important in order to induce a strong immune response. Therefore, for the heat-inactivated virus, a much higher dose of viral antigen and adjuvant are required to achieve an acceptable level of immunogenicity and protection.",

            "text": "Obviously, an ideal vaccine strain is required for the large-scale preparation of the inactivated EV71 vaccine, as has been the case for the Sabin oral polio vaccine (OPV) strain. Lin et al. 22 developed an EV71 strain, YN3-4a, exhibiting a rapid growth rate in Vero cells with a larger plaque size and a lower lethal dose (LD) 50 in newborn mice. Lin and coworkers showed that mouse antiserum raised against YN3-4a was able to neutralize a broad range of EV71 strains isolated from patients of a variety of geographic origins at different points in time. YN3-4a possesses desirable features, such as a high viral yield, the ability to propagate in serum-free medium, and strong immunogenicity, as well as broad-based antigenic coverage and passage stability, indicating its potential for development as an inactivated vaccine strain. A powerful cell system is also important in the development of an inactivated vaccine. As shown by Wu and coworkers, 23 a serumfree Vero cell culture with a 5 g/l Cytodex 1 microcarrier concentration in a 2-l bioreactor has also been established, yielding a high titer of 5.8 \u00c2 10 7 TCID 50 /ml EV71 production. On the basis of the study of Wu et al., 23 Liu et al. 24 showed that the serum-free culture increased post-infection cell death and reduced the virus productivity, but elicited a higher neutralizing antibody titer in immunized mice as compared to the serum-containing cultures. Therefore, the serum-free microcarrier culture is a valuable technique for developing inactivated EV71 vaccines on a large scale.",

This was introduced in the early 1960 s due to its easier administration, lower cost, and higher intestinal muscosal immunity than the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), and has since been approved for worldwide application for poliovirus eradication. 25, 26 Because of the similarities between poliovirus and EV71, Arita et al. 27, 28 have developed an EV71 attenuated strain, EV71 (S1-3 0 ), carrying mutations in the 5 0 UTR, 3D polymerase (3D pol ) and 3 0 UTR 5 0 non-translated based on the attenuation determinants of poliovirus. This EV71 (S1-3 0 ) strain is characterized by attenuated neurovirulence and limited spread of virus. In a subsequent study by Arita et al., 29 three cynomolgus monkeys were inoculated with EV71 (S1-3 0 ), followed by a lethal challenge with the parental virulent strain EV71 (BrCr-TR); they suffered mild neurological symptoms (tremor), but survived the lethal challenge without exacerbation of the symptoms. Moreover, the sera from the immunized monkeys showed a broad spectrum of neutralizing activities against different genotypes of EV71. These findings indicate that EV71 (S1-3 0 ) acts as an effective antigen.",

The Enterovirus genus can withstand human gastric acid and remain infectious below pH 3.0. However, VP1 is a capsid protein on the surface of the EV71 particle, and whether it can resist human gastric acid has not been fully addressed. Meanwhile, digestive enzymes may also degrade the antigens. In the experiment of Chen et al., mice gavaged with VP1 protein produced more VP1-specific antibodies than mice fed transgenic tomato containing more VP1 protein, in both sera and feces, indicating that chewing and digestion cause degradation of VP1 antigen. 37 Also, the oral rotavirus VP4 protein vaccine has been shown to provide lower levels of antibodies and less protection than immunization by injection of the rotavirus VP4 protein, 40 indicating the possible interference of digestive enzymes. Moreover, it has been difficult to determine the precise dose of antigens for immunization, since competition with food and microbial antigens interferes with the absorption rate of vaccine components. Therefore, to improve oral vaccine delivery, many strategies have been developed, such as using tissue-specific promoters, the addition of mucosal immune adjuvant, using liposomes to protect the fusion peptides in the phospholipid bilayer vesicles from the gastric enzymes, and N-trimethyl chitosan nanoparticles. 41, 42 For the oral EV71 VP1 subunit vaccine, exploring strategies to protect antigens from enzyme degradation in the gut is necessary.",

Furthermore, although the anti-VP1 IgG exhibited neutralizing activity against EV71, the neutralizing effect of the sera of mice immunized with the VP1 DNA vaccine was much lower than that of EV71-infected human serum. Another DNA vaccine developed by Wu et al., 21 elicited a high neutralization titer and stable titer level, which could be detected even at a late postimmunization time. However, because the DNA vaccine contains fewer antigenic epitopes, it induces a weaker immune stimulation than the whole virus particles. Therefore, strategies to increase the immune stimulation ability of DNA vaccines have been developed including: incorporation of immunostimulatory sequences in the backbone of the plasmid, co-expression of stimulatory molecules, use of localization/secretory signals, and an appropriate delivery system, as well as adjuvants and optimization of transgene expression. 43, [45] [46] [47] All these techniques can help to prepare a better EV71 DNA vaccine.",

Thus, identification of CD4+ T cell epitopes and B cell epitopes is of great importance in the design of effective epitope peptide vaccines. Foo and colleagues [48] [49] [50] have published several studies aimed at identifying the T-cell and B-cell epitopes of EV71. In these studies, they identified three regions, 66-77, 145-159, and 247-261, spanning amino acids of the VP1 protein; they showed that these three regions could induce proliferation of CD4+ T cells, then producing abundant IL-2 and IFN-g upon stimulation. Additionally, among the three peptides, amino acids 145-159 induced the strongest proliferative response and highest cytokine production. Furthermore, in order to identify the neutralizing linear epitopes, 95 overlapping synthetic peptides spanning the VP1 capsid protein of EV71 were used to immunize mice. 49 Peptides containing amino acids 163-177 and 208-222 of VP1 protein were capable of eliciting neutralizing antibodies against EV71, and the neutralizing antibodies elicited by the synthetic peptide 208-222 were able to confer good in vivo passive protection against homologous and heterologous EV71 strains in suckling Balb/c mice. 50 Moreover, the monoclonal antibody generated by immunizing mice with amino acids 208-222 of VP1 showed strong neutralizing activity against EV71 in an in vitro neutralization assay. 51 Therefore, the epitope peptide vaccine represents a promising candidate for EV71. The identification of more T-cell and B-cell epitopes of the VP1 protein, as well as a combination epitope peptide vaccine, should be considered in the search for a more effective epitope peptide vaccine.",

Due to the similarities between poliovirus and EV71 in many virological and clinical aspects, the success of the oral polio vaccine and inactivated-virus preparation in controlling poliomyelitis and eradicating the poliovirus, highlight the potential for controlling EV71 by vaccination. Poliovirus vaccine technology, both live attenuated and inactivated virus vaccines, can be adapted to control EV71 infection.",

Outbreaks of EV71 have been reported around the world since 1969. In economically developed nations, it typically causes a mild illness, and most patients usually recover quickly. However, since the late 1990 s, there has been a significant increase in EV71 epidemics, and it has emerged as a serious threat to public health throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Developed countries with the resources for vaccine research and development do not view EV71 as a priority, and the vaccine industry in developed countries has little incentive to develop a vaccine to EV71. At present, there are only a few vaccine industries in the Asia-Pacific region undertaking EV71 vaccine preparation. Therefore, to effectively control EV71, more effort and cooperation worldwide is needed.",

For the inactivated virus vaccine, the established regulatory standards may allow a license to be obtained to meet the immediate demands for EV71 control. Due to the need to conserve the threedimensional structure, the formalin-inactivated virus vaccine is a potential candidate vaccine for EV71. An oral EV71 attenuated vaccine has the potential to control EV71 in the same way as OPV controlling poliovirus, though further attenuation procedures are needed. At present, there are five genotypes of EV71. Crossprotection to the different genotypes for all the EV71 vaccines under current development is unclear. Hence, the preparation of a vaccine strain providing wide cross-protection is another important issue for EV71 vaccine development.",
