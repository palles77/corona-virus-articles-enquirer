It is also emerging as a powerful tool for in vivo research with over 90 studies published using synthetic small interfering RNAs in mammals. These reports demonstrate the potential for use of synthetic small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) as therapeutic agents, especially in the areas of cancer and viral infection. The number of reports using siRNAs for functional genomics applications, for validation of targets for small-molecule drug development programs, and to address questions of basic biology will rapidly grow as methods and protocols for use in animals become more established. This review will first discuss aspects of RNAi biochemistry and biology that impact in vivo use, especially as relates to experimental design, and will then provide an overview of published work with a focus on methodology.",

            "text": "Compounds that can selectively alter expression levels of any gene have been sought by basic scientists and clinicians for many years. Nucleic acid hybridization is very specific, and theoretically the sequence of any desired gene could be uniquely targeted by an oligonucleotide of complementary sequence. The first bantisenseQ experiments were performed over 25 years ago and employed DNA oligonucleotides to block translation of Rous sarcoma virus RNA [1, 2] . Experiments demonstrating the use of antisense RNA to inhibit gene expression soon followed [3, 4] . Most antisense methods that use single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) or single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) oligonucleotides rely upon either RNase H-mediated degradation of the target mRNA or steric blockade of translation for their mechanism of action [5] . However, other pathways have been exploited with favorable results. For example, 2V,5V-oligoadenylate (2-5A) triggers action of RNase L; conjugation of 2-5L to an antisense oligonucleotide sequence enables sequence-specific targeting of this otherwise nonspecific ribonuclease [6] .",

Pharmaceutical companies have been working to develop antisense drugs for more than 15 years and extensive knowledge of the pharmacology and toxicology of synthetic nucleic acids in vivo has been compiled [9] . As of 2005, one antisense drug is on the market. Formivirsen (Vitravene), a product of Isis Pharmaceuticals and Novartis Ophthalmics, is a 21-mer phosphorothioate DNA oligonucleotide that is complementary to the immediate early region 2 of cytomegalovirus (CMV). This compound has been shown to be effective in the treatment of CMV retinitis and was approved by the FDA for use by direct intravitreal injection in 1998 [10, 11] . Currently, over 20 antisense drugs are in various stages of clinical testing [12] . Although antisense methods have been successfully used for years to study gene function, antisense technology has failed to gain widespread acceptance as a gene knockdown tool, largely due to the extensive experimental testing that often needs to be done to find effective target sites within the gene of interest.",

            "text": "In 1998 Fire and Mello described a process in Caenorhabditis elegans in which long dsRNA (several hundred bases in length) caused suppression of complementary genes and called this process RNA interference (RNAi) [13] . Although the mechanism was not understood at the time, RNAi had actually been seen as early as 1990 in plants as the phenomenon of cosuppression [14] . In plants, it is suspected that the degradative pathways of RNAi evolved as an antiviral defense mechanism. In higher organisms, antiviral defense mechanisms are more complex and long dsRNAs induce interferon secretion, activating a cascade of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) as well as RNAi. Therefore, long dsRNAs should not be used as an experimental tool to trigger RNAi in mammalian cells. Fortunately, long dsRNAs do not mediate suppression directly. Instead, long dsRNAs are processed by the endoribonuclease Dicer into short 21-bp duplexes with 2-base 3V overhangs called small interfering (si) RNAs, which are the actual effector species [15] [16] [17] . Synthetic siRNAs can be transfected into mammalian cells and specifically suppress expression of complementary genes [18] , usually without triggering interferon responses. The siRNA enters a multimember protein complex called RISC (RNA induced silencing complex) by which one strand of the duplex (the bpassenger strandQ) is cleaved and discarded [19, 20] . The other strand is retained and serves as the bguide strand,Q which directs the sequence specificity of RISC and therefore of RNAi silencing. Some of the components of human RISC have been identified and have assigned functions. Argonaute 2 (Ago2) functions as bslicer,Q the RNA endonuclease that cleaves a target RNA species as directed by the siRNA guide strand [21] [22] [23] . Dicer and TRBP form a heterodimer, which processes long dsRNA into siRNAs [24, 25] , and together complex with the siRNA and Ago2 to form a functional silencing complex [26] . The biochemistry of degradative RNAi has been extensively studied and has been well summarized in recent reviews [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] .",

            "text": "Two different general approaches can be used to trigger RNA interference in vivo. First, synthetic RNA duplexes can be introduced directly into animals; the RNAi effect will be transient. In this case, the dsRNA is usually chemically synthesized and the problems surrounding its use parallel those encountered in small-molecule or antisense drug development. Alternatively, dsRNA can be expressed inside cells using DNA templates that direct synthesis of RNA duplexes or short hairpin RNAs; in this case the RNAi effect can be sustained and could theoretically be permanent, depending upon the vector employed and whether expression levels are adequately maintained long term. DNA-directed RNAi (ddRNAi) expression cassettes can be introduced into animals using plasmid or viral vectors. Problems surrounding this approach parallel those encountered with other forms of gene therapy. The present review is restricted to the use of chemically synthesized siRNA duplexes in vivo with a focus on methodology. Other recent reviews consider in vivo use of siRNA from different perspectives [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] .",

Phosphorothioate (PS) modifications can be easily placed in the RNA duplex at any desired position and will prolong the life of the duplex when exposed to serum or other nuclease sources. Limited PS modification preserves potency of the siRNA; however, extensively modified duplexes show reduced potency and/or toxicity [54] [55] [56] [57] . Extensive PS modification can also lead to artifacts due to nonspecific protein binding [58] , so it may be preferable to limit the use of this modification to terminal positions (or 3V overhangs) where added nuclease resistance is probably most important.

A number of reports have described patterns of 2V-O-methyl incorporation that retain full potency of the siRNA compared with unmodified RNA and are stable in serum [49, 55, 57] . The precise pattern of incorporation is important and RNAs that are entirely substituted with 2V-O-methyl are inactive as triggers of RNAi. Alternating the 2V-O-methyl bases retains potency and confers substantial nuclease resistance [49] . The 2V-fluoro (2V-F) modification has also been used with good results [54] [55] [56] . This modification is usually incorporated selectively at pyrimidine bases due to reagent issues. Their use either alone or in combination with 2V-O-methyl purines will stabilize RNA duplexes. In fact, duplexes can be fully modified such that no unmodified RNA remains [59] . Locked nucleic acids (LNAs) are a different class of 2V modification in which a methylene bridge connects the 2V-O with the 4V-C of the ribose. This modification blocksQ the ribose in the 3V-endo conformation and improves both duplex stability and nuclease resistance. LNAs can be incorporated into siRNAs; however, placement to achieve best effect is more restricted than for 2V-O-methyl or 2V-F bases [56, 60, 61] .",

Layzer and colleagues modified an anti-luciferase siRNA with 2V-F pyrimidines and compared it with unmodified siRNA in vivo using hydrodynamic tail vein injection. SiRNAs were co-injected with a luciferase expression plasmid and luciferase activity in the liver was assessed by in vivo bioluminescence imaging 2-7 days after injection [62] . Despite improved nuclease stability, no functional difference in luciferase knockdown was observed between modified and unmodified siRNAs. Using hydrodynamic delivery, injected nucleic acids are rapidly taken up by hepatocytes, thus nuclease resistance may not be as important for siRNA administered using this approach than when using more traditional low-pressure intravenous administration. Unfortunately, only a single 10-Ag siRNA dose was used, making it difficult to assess potency accurately without the additional data obtained from dose-response curves. Other groups have reported substantial benefit from the use of highly modified siRNA duplexes. Morrissey and colleagues compared activity of an unmodified siRNA with that of a highly modified duplex that included DNA bases, 2V-O-methyl purines, 2V-F pyrimidines, terminal inverted-dT bases, and PS linkage modification at select positions (leaving no unmodified RNA). A hepatitis B virus (HBV) expression plasmid was co-injected with modified or unmodified duplexes into the tail vein of mice using the same hydrodynamic delivery method, and production of HBV DNA and hepatitis B surface antigen was assayed 72 h postinjection [63] . A 2-log dose-response curve was performed and the modified duplexes were significantly more potent. Unmodified RNA may be suitable for use in some in vivo research applications, especially if a delivery vehicle that offers protection from serum nucleases is employed. However, there may be reasons beyond nuclease resistance to include modified bases in siRNAs used in vivo (see discussion of innate immunity below).",

Although originally viewed as a nuisance side effect, this observation opened an entirely new therapeutic use for DNA oligonucleotides as modulators of the immune system [69] [70] [71] [72] . The innate immune system relies upon a series of receptor molecules that recognize bpathogen-associated molecular patternsQ and that initiate a variety of cellular responses when these motifs are encountered [73, 74] .

This effect appeared to be sequence independent as two different siRNAs that did not share any obvious sequence motifs triggered the same effect. In contrast, stimulation of IFN-a, IFN-h, or phospho-PKR was not detected after administration of either 21-mer or 27-mer dsRNAs in HEK293 cells [38] . Activation of 2V,5V-OAS by dsRNA requires a minimum RNA length of 30 bp and maximal activation is not achieved until length reaches 60-80 bp [81] , so direct triggering of 2V,5V-OAS by siRNAs is unlikely to be a problem. Requirements for RIG-I activation are under investigation, but it appears that it can recognize short siRNAs and may be a major pathway for IFN production and activation of ISGs, at least in vitro (J. T. Marques and B. R. G. Williams, personal communication). RNA synthesized by in vitro transcription retains a triphosphate group at the 5V end, which can trigger a robust IFN response [82] ; this is easily avoided by use of chemically synthesized RNA of known structure and purity.",

Toll-like receptors 7 and 8 recognize ssRNA [86] and can be triggered by siRNAs in a sequence-specific fashion. Single-stranded RNA is more effective than double-stranded RNA in triggering TLR7 and 8 responses [87] . The sequences UGUGU [88, 89] and GUCCUUCAA [90] have been demonstrated to stimulate secretion of a variety of cytokines from TLR7-or 8-bearing cell types. TLR7 and 8 are expressed in a limited number of cell types including myeloid dendritic cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, neutrophils, B cells, and monocytes. However, these cells are found throughout the body; siRNAs can trigger IFN secretion from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), so stimulation of the innate immune system must be considered when using any kind of systemic administration [89] . TLR3, 7, and 8 are localized intracellularly in endosomes and delivery to this compartment must take place for activation to occur. In cell culture, cationic lipid transfection agents deliver nucleic acids to endosomal compartments, while electroporation does not, and siRNA delivery done using electroporation is less likely to stimulate IFN secretion [87] . These same principles appear to apply in vivo. Intravenous administration to mice of unmodified siR-NAs complexed in lipid particles is more likely to cause IFN pathway activation [52] than intravenous administration of unmodified bnakedQ siRNAs using high-volume hydrodynamic delivery [91] . Cationic DOTAP liposomes significantly enhance the ability of siRNA to trigger IFN responses in PBMCs and in mice [92, 93] . More information about siRNA activation of innate immunity via TLR signaling can be found in a recent review by Marques and Williams [94] .",

Use of chemically modified RNAs may overcome many of these problems. A recent study by Kariko and colleagues compared the capacity of RNA from prokaryotic and eukaryotic sources for their ability to trigger IFN responses. They observed that prokaryotic RNAs were a much more potent trigger of signaling through TLR3, 7, and 8 pathways than eukaryotic RNAs. Weaker or absent receptor signaling from eukaryotic RNAs was not sequence dependent but rather was due to the base and/or sugar modifications that were present in these nucleic acids. Much like 5-methyl-dC, which can reduce or prevent activation of TLR9 in CpG motif DNA, the presence of 5-methyl-C, N 6 -methyl-A, pseudouridine, or 2V-O-methyl bases prevents recognition of RNA by TLR3, 7, and 8 [95] . Importantly, it has been shown that extensive 2V modification of a sequence that is otherwise strongly immunostimulatory as unmodified RNA can prevent an immune response when that same sequence is administered intravenously (iv) in mice using a lipid-based particle delivery system [52] . However, it might not be necessary to modify an RNA duplex this extensively to block immune responses. Judge and colleagues reported that substitution of as few as two 2V-O-methyl bases in one strand of a siRNA duplex can be sufficient to block TLR activation both in vitro (human PBMCs) and in vivo (iv delivery in mice using stabilized nucleic acid lipid particle (SNALP)-facilitated delivery). Modified U and G bases were most effective in achieving this affect [96] . Since selective incorporation of 2V-O-methyl bases is inexpensive and does not compromise siRNA functional activity, use of this modification in all duplexes intended for in vivo applications should be considered.",

Degradative RNAi leads to sequence-specific cleavage of a target mRNA as directed by RISC using Ago2 [21, 22, 103] and initiation of this event requires perfect or near-perfect base pairing with the siRNA-derived guide strand. Conversely, the microRNA (miRNA) pathway results in translational repression and is directed by imperfect base pairing between target and guide strand [104, 105] . This pathway is theorized to be mediated by a variant of RISC using Ago1. Functionally, the siRNA degradative pathway and miRNA translational repression pathway overlap. Exogenously supplied siRNA duplexes can function as miRNAs [106, 107] and miRNAs can direct target cleavage events [108, 109] . It seems likely that many of the OTEs attributed to siRNAs derive from miRNA-like target interactions, which can be triggered by surprisingly limited sequence homology. Target specificity for miR-NAs is largely directed by a 7-nucleotide bseed regionQ at the 5V end of the antisense strand of the miRNA [110] . Unfortunately, even this small amount of homology can give rise to OTEs. Lin and colleagues reported results from a large-scale siRNA library screen in which their top three bhitsQ all derived from off-target events and, further, that two of these events resulted from only a 7-bp complementation between the siRNA and the boff targetQ [111] .",

When using siRNAs as research tools, a simple strategy to help ensure that results are not misinterpreted because of unsuspected OTEs is to require that two independent siRNAs against the same target produce the same biological results. For development of siRNAs as therapeutic agents, extensive testing may be needed to ensure that a potential drug candidate has an acceptable degree of OTEs.

Hong and colleagues described that high doses of a siRNA can induce expression of some genes involved in siRNA degradation and processing (meri-1 and adar-1) [112] . Stimulation of IFN pathways, OTEs, and desired gene knockdown are all dose dependent. The precise dose needed to trigger each response can be different and it may be possible to influence the relative magnitude of undesired side effects by careful attention to dosing.

            "text": "A wide variety of methods have been used to facilitate delivery of nucleic acids. Nucleic acids have a high negative charge density and cationic polymers are usually employed to bind the nucleic acid, neutralize charge, and assist with transport across the cell membrane. Cationic lipids are routinely used with great success as transfection agents in tissue culture; however, their in vivo use by iv administration presents significant problems as these reagents can be quite toxic. Despite problems with iv use, cationic lipids can sometimes be employed for ip injection [113] [114] [115] , for CNS injection [116, 117] , or in topical epithelial surface application [118, 119] . Toxicity varies with the precise chemical composition of the lipids employed, dose, and a variety of other factors. Variations in chemical composition can have a large impact on the functional properties of cationic lipid mixtures [120] and lipoplex/liposomal preparations have been devised with decreased toxicity that are more compatible with iv administration. Liposomal formulations have been FDA approved for smallmolecule drug delivery since the late 1990s [121] . Liposomes can be modified with ligands such as folate or small peptides, which assist with delivery and help target specific cell types or tissues [122, 123] . Through the use of neutral polyethylene glycol-substituted surfaces and other approaches, liposomes can be stabilized and made more bstealthy,Q showing reduced clearance and improved pharmacokinetics [124, 125] . These kinds of lipid nanoparticles have been successfully used to deliver antisense oligonucleotides and siRNAs in vivo [52, [126] [127] [128] .",

In fact, the single most commonly employed strategy for in vivo siRNA delivery to date has been the bhydrodynamic deliveryQ (HD) method [62, 63, 91, 112, [148] [149] [150] [151] [152] [153] [154] [155] [156] [157] [158] [159] [160] [161] [162] [163] [164] [165] . In this approach, a large volume of a nucleic acid solution is rapidly injected into the tail vein of a mouse, which transiently disrupts vascular and tissue integrity and achieves delivery [166] . Morbidity can be significant and success using this method is technique dependent. Nevertheless, HD is useful as a research tool and is especially effective in delivering nucleic acids to the liver. Recent reports have also demonstrated success using electroporation [167] [168] [169] [170] [171] [172] , ultrasound [173] , and particle-based bgene gunQ [174] delivery systems.",

Liposomes were administered by tail vein injection and mice were followed for 2 weeks. Two of three mice given a single dose of 100 mg/kg DOTAP liposomes died compared with 0/3 mice given CCLA liposomes.

Interaction with negatively charged serum proteins can inactivate the complex [175] and particle aggregation with clumping in capillary beds can be problematic; interaction with complement proteins can lead to inflammation. When loaded with a nucleic acid cargo, cationic lipids can trigger the release of a variety of cytokines (see discussion of TLR activation above). Lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and hepatic necrosis can occur with higher doses of lipid [176] . Newer classes of lipid/nucleic acids delivery systems fully encapsulate (not just complex with) the nucleic acid cargo and present a stabilized, more neutral surface to the intravascular environment that lowers toxicity, improves stability, and prolongs serum circulation time [177] . Recent reviews by Dass [178] , Audouy [179] , and Simberg [180] provide greater detail on cationic liposome delivery methods and in vivo toxicity.",

Cyclodextrin polymers are much less toxic, having an LD 50 of~200 mg/kg in mice [182] . Grafting of h-cyclodextrin onto PEI reduces toxicity but also can decrease efficiency of nucleic acid transfection, so careful optimization is needed. The addition of adamantine-PEG forms inclusion complexes that coat the complex in a way that further stabilizes the polymer/nucleic acid particle under physiological salt conditions without increasing size and helps further lower toxicity [133] . Transferrin or other ligands can be added to the polymer to help with celltype targeting.

If a cell line can be transfected with siRNAs in tissue culture using standard methods, it can subsequently be implanted into recipient animals in which changes in phenotype and behavior in vivo can be studied, avoiding the challenges associated with traditional in vivo delivery. For example, in one study that employed ex vivo methods, human melanoma tumor cells were transfected in culture using electroporation with either control siRNAs or siRNAs specific for a mutant V599E B-Raf gene. In this study, bstealthQ siRNAs were employed, which are chemically modified blunt 25-mer duplexes with selective incorporation of 2V-O-methyl RNA in the sense strand. Transfected cells were implanted in nude mice. Cells transfected with control siRNAs took~5 days to develop 10-mm tumor foci, whereas cells transfected with anti--V599E B-Raf siRNAs took 14-16 days to develop 10 mm tumor foci [184] .",

            "text": "The first published reports of the in vivo use of siRNAs in mammals appeared in mid-2002. McCaffrey and colleagues used HD delivery to introduce 2 Ag of a luciferase expression plasmid with 40 Ag of unmodified control or anti-luciferase siRNAs into mice [148] . A human a-1 antitrypsin (hAAT) expression plasmid was co-injected and serum levels of hAAT were used for normalization between animals. Luciferase activity in the liver was assessed by in vivo bioluminescence imaging 3 days after injection and the anti-luciferase siRNA was found to specifically reduce light emission by 81%. IFN levels (or other cytokines) were not measured; however, use of the hAAT marker served as a control for nonspecific effects. Similar results using HD delivery to suppress luciferase in mice were reported by Lewis and colleagues [149] . In this case RNAi activity was demonstrated to occur in multiple tissue types, including liver, kidney, spleen, lung, and pancreas. Duration of silencing was investigated using an expression plasmid encoding secreted human placental alkaline phosphatase (SEAP). Ten micrograms of the pSEAP plasmid and 5 Ag of an anti-SEAP siRNA were administered by HD injection. SEAP levels were suppressed by 83% on day 1 postinjection and by 32% on day 4 and were at control levels on day 14 (possibly sooner, but intermediate time points were not reported). Song and colleagues reported using siRNAs to protect mice from liver damage in two model systems involving Fas-mediated apoptosis [150] . Anti-Fas siRNAs or control anti-EGFP siRNAs (50 Ag in 1 ml PBS) were administered using HD delivery for three doses. Both Fas mRNA and Fas protein levels were shown to be specifically reduced about 10-fold (Fas/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) ratio) in recipient mouse hepatocytes relative to controls. Suppression lasted~10 days. Mice treated with the anti-Fas siRNA did not develop fulminant hepatitis or hepatic fibrosis after treatment with concanavalin A (which induces hepatitis). Treatment with the anti-Fas siRNA was also protective against treatment with an agonist, an anti-Fas antibody (Jo2), which is normally fatal within 2-3 days of injection. Similar beneficial effects were reported using the same anti-Fas siRNA in protecting mice from renal ischemia-reperfusion injury [156] . SiR-NAs were administered by HD delivery via the tail vein (50 Ag in 1 ml PBS) or by low-pressure injection directly into the renal vein. In one series of experiments, renal ischemia was induced by clamping one renal pedicle for 35 min, and the other kidney was removed. Survival was significantly higher (8/10) for mice treated with anti-Fas siRNA than with control siRNA or saline (2/10). Caspase 8 is a critical enzyme in the Fas apoptosis pathway. Zender and colleagues reported use of siRNAs targeting caspase 8 to block hepatic necrosis following challenge with the agonist anti-Fas antibody (Jo2) or recombinant adenovirus encoding Fas ligand [152] . SiR-NAs were administered using HD tail vein injection at a dose of 0.6 nmol/g (8 mg/kg, or 200 Ag per dose per 25-g mouse) or a 0.45 nmol infusion directly into the portal vein. The caspase 8 mRNA levels were reduced about fourfold (caspase 8/GAPDH ratio) following siRNA treatment in mouse hepatocytes. Following administration of the Jo2 Fas-agonist antibody, 5/11 mice treated with the anti-caspase 8 siRNA survived, while 0/17 control animals survived. Using a strategy similar to that discussed previously for protection of Fas-induced renal ischemiareperfusion injury, Contreras and colleagues reported success in using anti-caspase 8 and anti-caspase 3 siRNAs in protecting mice from hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury [154] . A variant of HD delivery was employed in which low dose 0.45 nmol (6 Ag) siRNA was administered in 1 ml volume directly into the portal vein. SiRNAs were administered 1 h before injury, hepatic blood supply was clamped for 90 min, and hepatic caspase 3 and 8 levels were assayed 1 h after reperfusion. Both caspase enzymes are strongly induced by ischemia; however, the relative level of induction was reduced approximately twofold by siRNA treatment. In one arm of the study, mice were observed for 30 days after a 75-min ischemic injury to the liver, with or without siRNA pretreatment. Mice treated with anti-caspase 3 showed 50% survival (5/10), mice treated with anti-caspase 8 showed 30% survival (3/10), while control mice showed 10% survival (1/10, control siRNA) or no survival (0/10, vehicle).",

            "text": "Hydrodynamic delivery has also been used to study the antiviral potential of siRNAs in vivo. Giladi and colleagues demonstrated that a plasmid encoding the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome can be codelivered with siRNAs to the liver of mice using the HD method to study the effects of anti-HBV siRNAs on viral replication [151] . Five HBV siRNAs were tested, which, not surprisingly, showed different functional potency. The most potent reagent was capable of reducing HBV titers produced in transfected livers by 10 5 on day 2 and 10 2 on day 3 at the dose studied (15 Ag HBV plasmid with 1 nmol, or 13 Ag siRNA). Morrissey and colleagues employed a similar HBV plasmid model system to study the use of anti-HBV siRNAs in mice, also using HD delivery [63] , and compared performance of modified vs unmodified RNAs. The modified duplexes (called bsmall interfering nucleic acids, or siNAs) performed better, showing a 1.5-log greater reduction in HBV DNA and surface antigen levels 72 h postinjection than when the same sequence was administered as an unmodified siRNA. Importantly, only the modified duplexes suppressed HBV when treatment was started 3 days after binfectionQ (via delivery of the HBV plasmid by HD injection); however, a significantly higher dose was needed in this setting (30 mg/kg). Although HD has largely been viewed as a research tool, Hagstrom and colleagues reported success using this method to deliver siRNAs and other nucleic acids to skeletal muscle in rats, dogs, and rhesus macaques [155] . In this variant of the HD method, a limb is functionally isolated by application of a blood pressure cuff or tourniquet and a large-volume bolus of nucleic acid solution is administered intravenously. Therapeutic delivery of plasmids or siRNAs in humans using this approach was proposed; if care is taken in technique, only moderate, reversible tissue damage was observed [185] .",

A high level of RR is believed to be one cause of resistance to gemcitabine chemotherapy. RR levels can be reduced using siRNAs targeting the M2 subunit of RR (RRM2) and this treatment increases tumor cell susceptibility to gemcitabine in vitro. MIAPaCa2 pancreatic tumor cells were implanted in nude mice and were given control treatments, an anti-RRM2 siRNA (150 Ag/kg iv), and/or gemcitabine (150 mg ip) twice weekly for 6 weeks. Mice treated with the anti-RRM2 siRNA showed reduced RRM2 levels in tumor extracts by Western blot compared with control siRNA-treated mice. Treatment with gemcitabine or the anti-RRM2 siRNA alone resulted in a modest reduction in tumor volume, while treatment with the combination of gemcitabine with anti-RRM2 siRNA showed a synergistic effect with 87% reduction in tumor size. Mice receiving combination treatment had no detectable liver metastasis, whereas 80% of control and 40% of gemcitabine or siRNA monotherapy animals had significant tumor burden in their livers. This group continued to investigate using siRNAs as a therapy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma using a different target, CEA-CAM6, a cell-surface adhesion molecule thought to play a role in tumor progression and metastasis. As before, unmodified siRNAs were administered at a dose of 150 Ag/kg in PBS iv via the tail vein twice weekly. BxPC3 cells were implanted in the pancreas of nude mice and animals were given PBS alone, a control siRNA, or an anti-CEACAM6 siRNA for 6 weeks. Mice treated with targetspecific siRNAs had smaller tumors, 46% lower CEACAM6 levels, reduced evidence of angiogenesis (CD34 + structures using immunohistochemical staining), and reduced hepatic metastasis compared to control mice. Survival after 6 weeks of treatment was 0/10 for PBS-treated mice, 0/10 for control siRNA-treated mice, and 9/10 for anti-CEACAM6treated mice [189] .",

Soutschek and colleagues described the use of cholesterol-conjugated siRNAs to reduce expression of apolipoprotein B (apoB) in mice and assessed the impact that this had on serum cholesterol and lipoprotein particle levels [65] . Duplexes were chemically modified by selective incorporation of 2V-O-methyl RNA bases and phosphorothioate linkages. Cholesterol modification increased serum half-life 15fold compared with unconjugated siRNAs. Following iv injection, siRNA levels present in various tissues were measured using a sensitive RNase protection assay (RPA) and only the modified, conjugated RNA duplexes were detectable; these siRNAs were seen in liver, heart, kidney, adipose, and lung tissue. Extensive sequence optimization was performed; 84 siRNAs were screened in vitro and the 2 best candidates were used in vivo. Mice received the anti-apoB siRNAs or a control siRNA at a dose of 50 mg/kg iv daily for 3 days and cholesterol levels were measured 24 h after the last dose. ApoB-100 protein levels were reduced by 68% (siRNA apoB-1) and by 31% (siRNA apoB-2); the more potent siRNA showed a 37% reduction in total serum cholesterol. Although IFN or other cytokines were not measured directly to assess activation of the innate immune system, mRNA levels for three unrelated control genes were found to be unaffected by siRNA treatment. Mechanism of action was demonstrated in vivo using a 5V-RACE procedure. ApoB species were identified that had a cleavage point exactly at the site predicted using the apoB-1 siRNA (10 bp from the 5V end of the antisense strand of the siRNA).",

Chien and colleagues described the use of the CCLA liposomes to deliver siRNAs by tail vein injection in mice [128] . Delivery efficiency was estimated to be approximately sevenfold better than with traditional DOTAP liposomes and had lower toxicity. The Ras/Raf/MAPK signaling pathway is thought to be important in around 30% of human cancers. An unmodified siRNA specific for c-raf was administered via the tail vein at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg twice a day for 5 days to SCID mice bearing sc implants of the breast cancer tumor MDA-MB-231. Tumors in mice treated with naked siRNAs grew at the same rate as controls, while tumors in mice treated with liposomal-siRNAs were 73% smaller at day 8, suggesting that the delivery vehicle had a significant impact on the therapeutic efficacy of the anti-c-Raf siRNA treatment. A similar series of experiments studied the effect of an anti-Raf-1 siRNA with or without the chemotherapy agent Taxotere in suppressing the growth of sc implants of the prostate cancer cell line PC-3 in SCID mice [127] . Mice were administered unmodified siRNAs at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg twice a day for 5 days, either naked or complexed in CCLA liposomes, with or without the coadministration of Taxotere (10 mg/kg on day 2 and 5 mg/kg on day 5). Tumors were excised and Western blots were performed to examine Raf-1 protein levels. Relative to the control siRNA, administration of free Raf-1 siRNAs reduced Raf-1 protein levels by 37% (Raf-1/GAPDH ratio), liposomal Raf-1 siRNAs reduced Raf-1 levels by 89%, and the combination of liposomal siRNAs + Taxotere reduced Raf-1 levels by 98%. Naked siRNAs had no effect on tumor growth, while the liposomal anti-Raf-1 siRNA inhibited tumor growth by 49%, and, when combined with Taxotere, inhibited tumor growth by 89%.",

Dye-labeled RNA duplexes were injected into mice iv and the use of naked, DOTAP liposome, and DOPC liposome delivery was compared using fluorescence microscopy. The DOPC liposomes gave an estimated 10-fold improved delivery compared with DOTAP liposomes and 30-fold improved delivery compared with naked RNA; the greatest uptake of siRNA was seen in liver, kidney, and lung. EphA2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor that is overexpressed in some human cancers and is associated with poor outcome in ovarian cancer. Nude mice with ip implants of the ovarian cancer cell line HeyA8 or SKOV3ip1 were given control or anti-EphA2 siRNA (150 Ag/kg iv twice weekly in DOPC liposomes) for 4 weeks, with or without the chemotherapeutic agent Paclitaxel (100 Ag ip weekly). Compared with mice receiving the control siRNA, average tumor size was reduced by 35-50% using the anti-EphA2 siRNA, 45-68% using Paclitaxel, and 86-91% with combination therapy. Several studies have reported similar observations in which the combination of siRNA with a cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent worked additively or synergistically in reducing tumor size. It is also worth noting the very low dose of siRNA employed in this study, presumably due to improved delivery using the neutral liposome carrier.",

Unmodified siRNAs administered using this delivery method strongly stimulated innate immune responses while the highly modified duplexes did not. Delivery of a fluorescent siRNA was examined and use of SNALPs resulted in highest levels of RNA in liver and spleen but showed little accumulation in lung. Plasma half-life of modified siNAs in SNALPs was 6.5 h compared with 2 min for unmodified naked siRNAs. Hepatitis binfectionQ was initiated with HD delivery of 0.3 Ag of pWTD HBV plasmid and siRNA therapy was started 6 days later. Mice received control or anti-HBV siRNAs in SNALPs at doses of 0.3 or 3 mg/kg/day for 3 days. Serum HBV DNA levels dropped by 1.5 log 10 for the higher dose, and reduction in HBV DNA levels persisted for 6 weeks after the last siNA dose.

Schiffelers and colleagues described the use of a bsterically stabilized nanoparticleQ to deliver unmodified siRNAs to neuroblastoma N2A tumors in nude mice [130] . The particles contained PEI (bPQ nanoparticles), PEI + PEG (bPPQ nanoparticles) or PEI + PEG plus an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide that promotes vascular targeting (bRPPQ nanoparticles). Complex formation of siRNAs in the particles (nanoplexes) protected unmodified siRNAs from degradation in serum and altered in vivo delivery patterns. A fluorescence-labeled naked siRNA did not accumulate in tumors, lung, or liver and was mostly degraded and/or excreted in urine. The fluorescence-labeled P nanoplex accumulated more in lung than in liver or tumor, while the labeled RPP nanoplex improved uptake more selectively in the N2A tumor masses (distribution of PP nanoplexes was not reported). SiRNA duplexes specific for the murine vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) were administered to mice bearing N2A tumors at a dose of 40 Ag iv every 3 days. After three cycles of treatment, mice receiving the anti-VEGFR2 siRNA as an RPP nanoplex showed N90% inhibition of tumor growth compared with vehicle-only or control siRNA-treated mice.

Many Ewing sarcoma tumors contain a translocation, t (11;22) , that results in production of an aberrant transcript, EWS-FL11, which is thought to function as an oncogenic transcription factor. An anti-EWS-F11 siRNA (siEFB2) and a control siRNA were administered to SCID mice bearing tumors formed from TC71 cells that stably express luciferase (enabling bioluminescence imaging of tumor implants). Administration of siEFB2 for 3 days using the transferrin polyplex at a dose of 50 Ag (2.5 mg/kg/day) resulted in transient suppression of the luciferase signal and 60% reduction in EWS-F11 mRNA levels (normalized to h-actin) in estab-lished tumors. In another series of experiments, siRNA administration was started concurrent with injection of the TC71-Luc tumor cells. Mice were followed for up to 8 weeks with twice weekly dosing (2.5 mg/kg) of siRNAs. Mice receiving control siRNAs (in any form) and those receiving naked siEFB2 had rapid tumor development. Mice receiving siEFB2 with nontargeting polyplexes had delayed onset of tumors and those receiving siEGB2 delivered with transferrin polyplexes had minimal to no tumor formation. Ogris and colleagues described the use of transferrin and epidermal growth factor as ligands to improve targeting of DNA polyplexes (PEGylated PEI) to tumor cells in mice [195] .

Song and colleagues described a method in which protamine was conjugated to the C-terminus of an antibody Fab fragment and used as a cell-marker-specific reagent to deliver unmodified siRNAs in mice [138] . In one series of experiments, a Fab fragment (F105) specific for the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp160 was coupled to protamine (F105-P). Six siRNAs formed a delivery complex with one F105-P carrier. This complex was effective in delivering siRNAs to all cell types tested that expressed the HIV env gene, even T cells (which are notoriously difficult to transfect). Administration of siRNAs using the F105-P carrier did not elicit an immune response in B16 melanoma cells in vitro (h-IFN, STAT1, and OAS1 mRNA levels were assayed using qRT-PCR). While B16 cells are competent for some TLR responses and express TLR3 [196] , it may be worthwhile to determine if this method of delivery triggered any innate immune response in myeloid or dendritic cell lines or in vivo. Murine B16 cells were implanted in C57BL/6 mice and different siRNAs were administered iv with or without the F105-P carrier. A fluorescent dye-labeled control siRNA was used to assess specificity of delivery. Naked siRNA did not enter tumor cells. Using the F105-P carrier, gp160-B16 tumors showed high uptake of the dye-labeled siRNA, whereas native B16 tumors did not, demonstrating the specificity of this delivery method. Tumor gp160-B16 cells were injected into the flanks of recipient mice and a cocktail of three siRNAs specific for c-myc, MDM2, and VEGF was administered either iv or by direct tumor injection with or without the F105-P carrier on days 0, 1, and 3 at a dose of 80 Ag (~4 mg/kg); tumors were removed at day 9. Both intratumor and iv administration of the siRNA cocktail with F105-P delivery significantly reduced tumor size, whereas naked siRNAs or control treatments had no effect.",

A reduction of viral titers ranging from 1 to 3 log 10 was seen and siRNA treatment was effective even when given 5-24 h after infection. Thomas and colleagues reported that deacylated PEI (PEI187) improved delivery of plasmid DNA in mice by iv administration 10 4 -fold and dramatically improved pulmonary targeting [131] .

As mentioned previously, the only FDA-approved antisense drug (Vitravene) is given by intraocular injection to treat CMV retinitis. Intraocular injection is therefore an obvious approach for in vivo use of siRNAs for both research applications and pharmaceutical development. Reich and colleagues described the use of unmodified siRNAs administered by intraocular injection to inhibit neovascularization following laser photocoagulation [200] . To demonstrate the feasibility of the method, recombinant adenovirus expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were injected subretinally in the eyes of mice with or without 20 pmol (~0.27 Ag) of an anti-EGFP siRNA, and retina were examined at 48 h. The anti-EGFP siRNA almost totally eliminated EGFP fluorescence, even using this very low dose. Administration of a similar low dose of an anti-VEGF siRNA reduced the area of choroidal neovascularization after laser photocoagulation injury by~75%.",

SiRNA was administered as a direct intravitreal injection at doses of 1.5 or 0.5 Ag in 1 Al PBS on days 1 and 7 following laser-induced rupture in Bruch's membrane. On day 14, choroidal neovascularization was visualized using fluoresceinlabeled dextran and fluorescence microscopy. Neovascularization was reduced by 56% using the 1.5-Ag dose compared with injection of a control siRNA (in the other eye) and by 66% using the 0.5-Ag dose compared with injection of PBS alone. A dose of 7.5 Ag given by periocular injection (a less traumatic method of administration) on days 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13 resulted in a 45% reduction in neovascularization following laser treatment. Treatment with Sirna-027 was also protective against oxygen-induced ischemic retinopathy. Both VEGFR1 mRNA and protein were demonstrated to be specifically reduced by injection of Sirna-027. Distribution of a BrdU-labeled siRNA after intravitreous injection was studied. After 6 h, labeled siRNA was detected in ganglion cells and by 12-24 h the siRNA was present in ganglion cells and the inner nuclear layer. By 48 h, staining was absent in ganglion cells but was increased in photoreceptor cell bodies. Injected siRNA was no longer detectable at 5 days postinjection.",

SiRNAs in PBS were administered either naked or complexed with the cationic lipid TransIT-TKO by direct intranasal infusion in mice at a dose of 35 Ag in each nostril (70 Ag total dose, or 3.5 mg/kg). Treatment with naked siRNAs was~70% as effective as with cationic lipid. Mice receiving antiviral siRNAs showed decreased lung pathology and overall distress compared with mice receiving control siRNAs. Although the greatest improvement was seen when treatment was started at the time of infection, some benefit was seen when siRNA treatment was given 1, 2, and even 3 days postinfection.",

Li and colleagues describe the use of unmodified siRNAs delivered intranasally in D5W in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) [217] . Delivery of siRNAs targeting a reporter construct were first tested using D5W or InfaSurf via intranasal delivery in mice and the D5W carrier gave superior results and was therefore employed in the primate studies. A mixture of two siRNAs specific for the Spike protein-coding and ORF1b regions was administered 4 h prior to infection (single dose), at the time of infection (and at 1, 3, and 5 days postinfection), or 4 h postinfection (and at 1 and 3 days postinfection). Each dose was 30 mg in 3 ml D5W and total cumulative dosing was 30 to 120 mg siRNA (10-40 mg/kg). The severity of symptoms was improved in all treatment groups. Animals were tested at 4 days postinfection for the presence of SCV RNA using a qRT-PCR assay (from oropharyngeal swab samples); all control animals were positive for SCV viral RNA, while 75% of anti-SCV siRNA-treated animals had no detectable viral RNA.",

Interestingly, it is also being employed to assist with siRNA delivery in vivo. Golzio and colleagues described electroporation-assisted delivery of an EGFP expression plasmid with or without an unmodified anti-EGFP siRNA following direct injection into mouse muscles in PBS [171] . EGFP fluorescence was specifically reduced by the anti-EGFP but not the control siRNA; targeting of an endogenous target was not described. Schiffelers and colleagues used electroporation to assist with delivery of unmodified siRNAs targeting TNF-a in mice with collagen-induced arthritis [170] . Injection of an EGFP expression plasmid into the knee joint of mice showed local expression of EGFP only if electroporation was employed. Coadministration (injection + electroporation) of 2 Ag of a luciferase expression plasmid with 10 Ag of either the anti-EGFP (control) or the anti-Luc siRNAs showed 90% suppression of luciferase activity when the anti-Luc siRNA was used. Collageninduced arthritis was induced by injection of mice with type II collagen and inflammation was triggered with ip injection of LPS 3 days after the second dose of collagen. Anti-TNF-a siRNA treatment was initiated 3 days after LPS treatment at a dose of 10 Ag (direct injection with electroporation into the knee joint) and was administered weekly for three doses. Animals treated with the anti-TNF-a siRNA showed a marked improvement in inflammation and reduced arthritis score relative to control animals. Similarly, Inoue and colleagues used electroporation to assist with delivery of an unmodified siRNA targeting TNF-a in rats with collagen-induced arthritis [172] . In this case, 0.8 nmol (~11 Ag) of the anti-TNF-a siRNA or a control siRNA was injected into the knee joint in rats in cationic lipid (siPORT Amine) followed by electroporation. TNF-a mRNA levels were reduced in synovial tissue and inflammation was markedly reduced as assessed by both paw swelling and histological examination in anti-TNF-a-treated animals relative to controls.",

Infection with human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) is associated with development of cervical carcinoma. Attempts to immunize mice against HPV-16 through the use of a DNA vaccine (a plasmid expressing the E7 gene of HPV-16) resulted in an incomplete response, partially due to the transient nature of antigen presentation by resident antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The authors tested if coadministration of the HPV-16 E7 plasmid with siRNAs targeting the proapoptotic genes BAX and BAK would prolong survival of the APCs and improve vaccination. Nucleic acids were coated onto gold microcarriers and delivered subdermally using the Helios gene gun at a dose of 2 Ag plasmid coadministered with 0.2 Ag unmodified anti-BAK + anti-BAX siRNAs. Vaccine delivered with the BAK + BAX siRNAs increased the number of antigen-specific IFN-g + CD8 + T cell precursors. Further, mice receiving the combined vaccine (E7 with BAX + BAK siRNAs) showed a marked reduction in tumor burden when injected with TC-1 cells expressing the E7 antigen compared with mice that received the E7 vaccine with the control siRNA.",

Few published studies actually measured cytokine levels. Most simply employed bcontrolQ siRNAs to ensure that immune stimulation or other unintended events did not occur. Given the sequence-specific nature of innate immune responses, confidence in these kinds of controls may be misplaced, even if modified siRNAs that have a lower incidence of immune stimulation are employed. Measurement of serum IFN-a, TNF-a, and possibly IL-12 levels at~4-6 h posttreatment should be considered, especially when systemic administration methods are employed. If local administration is employed, assays should include extracts prepared from the injected site/ organ as well as from serum.",

Microarrays have been used to assess the extent of OTEs at the gene expression level on a genome-wide scale in studies done in cell culture; however, this kind of experiment has not been reported yet in vivo and these kinds of data might be difficult to interpret. One approach to control for OTEs would be to require the use of two (or more) different siRNAs against the same target with the expectation that both result in suppression of the targeted gene and produce the same biological response (phenotype). Few of the in vivo studies reported to date confirmed results using two independent siRNA sequences. Further, few of the studies discussed here performed any kind of dose-response optimization of the siRNA reagent in vivo and instead simply reported results using a single dosing regimen. Even though these studies are expensive to perform in mammals, it is important to characterize the system fully and this kind of information may uncover dose-dependent side effects. Actual OTE-related events will probably show variation between individuals, especially in outbred populations, making these controls even more important to include in this setting.",

Route of administration and choice of which delivery tool to use will be crucial to success. Other than hydrodynamic delivery, too few in vivo studies have been published using any other single method to accumulate the amount of information needed to assess functional performance adequately (with different target genes and different target tissues) or permit a general endorsement of that method, although several approaches do seem quite promising. Unfortunately, many of the most advanced delivery systems employed in the studies discussed above are not available to most researchers. Widespread adoption of RNAi using synthetic siRNAs as an in vivo research tool will accelerate as more effective mammalian delivery tools become commercially available. If the target tissue or system of study permits the use of a local delivery approach, this method may be easier to perform using boff the shelfQ tools and offer greater assurance of success than systemic iv administration.",
