The objective was to determine factors associated with time to neonatal gastroenteritis. By taking into account the ''intra-herd'' correlation in failure time (in the semiparametric Cox model), we identified 12 management risk factors associated with hazard of diarrhoea. Some previously have been identified, but ''new'' risk factors were feeding of corn silage and the incidence of diarrhoea in the last season. We used the two main approaches which are often reviewed: marginal and frailty Cox models. Our results show that these two models give different parameter estimates, so the choice of the model remains crucial. #",

With the marginal approach (Wei et al., 1989 ), a survival model is specified for each subject of the cluster along with assumptions about the dependence of survival times within clusters. Alternatively, a frailty model (Vaupel et al., 1979; Andersen et al., 1999) postulates that the hazard within a particular cluster is the product of a function of the covariates and a cluster-specific parameter known as the ''frailty''. The frailty commonly is used to indicate unobserved (i.e. ''latent'') cluster-specific variables. Furthermore, independence among observed data items is assumed conditional on the frailty.",

Then, any variable with P 0:2 was eligible for the next step in a multivariable model. In the second step, previously qualified variables were grouped into the same model within categories: feeding system, management, calving, housing and so on. This grouping procedure took into account potential confounding factors and the inter-relationships between variables of the same class. In the third step, two final multivariable models were fitted with all the variables that had remained significant during the two previous steps: the first one was a MCM and the second one was a gamma FCM.
