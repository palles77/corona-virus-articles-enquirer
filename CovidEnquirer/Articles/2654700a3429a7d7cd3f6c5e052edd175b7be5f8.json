In this study we developed a lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation cell model on macrophages and a lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation mouse model. It was found that during inflammation, microRNA-9 was increased, accompanied with the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Down-regulation of microRNA-9 inhibited the up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines, promoted the up-regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines and induced the remission of organ damage, showing a protective effect in inflammation. Bioinformatics analysis combined with luciferase reporter assay showed that SIRT1 was the target gene of microRNA-9. Transfection of microRNA-9 inhibitor could increase the level of SIRT1 and decrease the activation of NF-\u03baB pathway in macrophages. Myeloid specific sirt1 knockout mice were included and we found that lack of SIRT1 in mice macrophages led to aggravated inflammation, cell apoptosis and organ injury, and eliminated the protective property of microRNA-9 inhibitor. In conclusion, we demonstrated that inhibition of microRNA-9 could alleviate inflammation through the up-regulation of SIRT1 and then suppressed the activation of NF-\u03baB pathway. This is a meaningful explore about the specific mechanism of microRNA-9 in inflammation.",

Organ-specific receptors are activated during severe inflammation and this systemic reaction is called the acute-phase response [3] . In case the initial stimulus cleared unsuccessfully, a system-wide inflammation, even a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) will be started, and finally lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) [4] . MODS is defined as the progressive dysfunction of two or more organs and is responsible for the majority of the morbidity and mortality among patients in intensive care units [5, 6] . MODS unleashes complicated systemic reactions which is initiated simultaneously by host pattern recognition and endogenous signals. Then multiple signal pathways are activated which ultimately lead to over-expression of cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, IL-6 and affect cellular metabolism [7] [8] [9] . MODS involves disorders of endothelial system, immune system and coagulation system [10] . It is a much more complex situation than inflammation and SIRS [11] . It is critical to control inflammation in early stage and to avoid the progression into SIRS and MODS.",

In this study, we explored the potential effects of miR-9 on multiple organs injury in inflammation and the mechanism involved. Macrophages participate in the regulation of inflammatory responses and protect organ function damage [31, 32] . We constructed an inflammation macrophages model and found the expression of pro-inflammation cytokines as well as anti-inflammatory cytokine increased significantly in LPS induced macrophages. MiR-9 also increased in this process, consistent with results drawn from previous study [27] . So we suspected that miR-9 might play a role in inflammation of LPS stimulated macrophages.

Both tumor suppressor and oncogenic roles of miR-9 have been deeply reported in tumors, by binding to corresponding genes, such as E-cadherin, SOCS5, HES1, CXCR4, TLN1, NF-\u03baB1 and so on [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . Apart from tumor, miR-9 also plays an irreplaceable role in many kinds of inflammation. During viral infection, miR-9 was reported to act as a intermediary in NF-\u03baB activation induced by nucleocapsid protein of human coronavirus OC43 [38] . In human atherosclerosis inflammation cell models, miR-9 inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation through JAK1/STAT signaling pathway [24] . In knee osteoarthritis, down-regulated miR-9 facilitate proliferation and anti-apoptosis of chondrocytes by directly binding to NF-\u03baB1 [39] . During inflammatory response following cerebral ischemia, miR-9 is downregulated and up-regulated miR-9 relief inflammatory injury by inhibit the expression and nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p65 [40] , While others demonstrate that MCPIP1 is the direct target of miR-9 in microglial and the LPS-induced miR-9 promote microglial activation by MCPIP1-NF-\u03baB pathway [25] . In addition, the impacts of miR-9 on macrophage polarization were also noticeable [41] [42] [43] . MiR-9, the only miRNA (out of the 365 tested) consistently induced by LPS in a MyD88and NF-\u03baB-dependent manner in both monocytes and polymorphonuclear neutrophils [27] , has been shown to promote M1 polarization by target peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b4 (PPAR\u03b4) [23] . Furthermore, miR-9 mediated down-regulation of Dusp6 and enhanced ERK-mediated signal transduction was reported to involved in classical activation of CCL2 pre-treated macrophages [44] .",

However, understanding of connection between miR-9 and inflammation is far from enough. Numerous studies have implicated the involvement of NF-\u03baB signaling in sepsis and the direct interaction of miR-9 and the 3'UTR of NF-\u03baB1 is well illustrated, whether there is a intermediary between them attracts our interest. So TargetScan, PicTar and miRanda were used to explore the key gene in the downstream of miR-9 and found that SIRT1, a NAD + dependent deacetylase enzyme, which was broadly reported to be a crucial gene in inflammation [45, 46] , was the potential target of miR-9. We found that down-regulation of miR-9 could increase the level of SIRT1, and vice verse. Furthermore, luciferase reporter assay verified that SIRT1 was the target of miR-9. All in all, we have enough evidence to accept that SIRT1 was the downstream gene of miR-9.",

It is well demonstrated that activation of SIRT1 leads to deacetylation of Re1A/p65, thereby leading to transcriptional repression of various inflammation-related genes [50, 51] , consistent with our results in LPS induced macrophages. To further verify the miR-9-SIRT1-NF-\u03baB pathway in vivo, myeloid specific sirt1 knockout mice were used. It showed that the protective effects of miR-9 inhibitor were abolished because of the lack of SIRT1. Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines increased and the pathological injury aggravated in sirt1 \u2212/\u2212 mice than those of WT mice.",
