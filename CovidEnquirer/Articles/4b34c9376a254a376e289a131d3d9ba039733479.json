Despite their predominance, however, these diseasescardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, cancer, pulmonary disease, mental health, and dementia-attract little attention in the public health curriculum and even less from the funding community. We explore the rationales that have perpetuated this inability or unwillingness to match need with effort. We examine 3 concepts that impede changing this relationship: 1) the traditional contextual view of public health that emerged, to be sure with great success, in the posteWorld War II era; 2) the failure of public health to transition to economic development as the goal of health assistance; and 3) the unwillingness of public health to confront social, political, and economic policies as the foci of upstream drivers of the public's health. We conclude with a discussion of the need for public health to expand its horizon and tear down the walls of the silos that inhibit the emergence of relevant global public health.",

Coupled with urbanization, these forces have led to a fall in fertility, a transformative makeover of the workforce with women leading the way, and the urban diet and life-style globally taking on more and more of a Western pattern. Compounding these changes, technological transformations in trade, communication, connectivity, and information availability have altered virtually everything from expectations and aspirations to physical activity, food availability, and smoking patterns.

In the United States, ignored is the correct word. CD gets somewhere between 1% and 3% of donor support [8] , and these diseases are all but absent from the curriculum in the leading schools of public health in the United States [9] . Progress in schools of public health has been made elsewhere, notably the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and parts of Europe, India, and China. In the United Kingdom, the Center for Global Non-communicable Diseases at the London School of Health and Tropical Medicine has begun to influence the academic curriculum. But, the United States lags. Some of the newer schools of public health, particularly those that began as global health programs, have begun to emphasize CDs, and 1 program does merit mention. The Fogarty-United Health Care Centers of Excellence have begun to reap the benefits of their efforts and are producing qualified and competent professionals in centers around the world [10] .

Putting post-marketing restrictions on processed foods with a long shelf life lacks the long-term potency of conducting the research and analysis of trade agreements. Insights derived from this research may indicate what might be done to influence cross-border trade and investment in both food production and provision so as to foster better health [13] . To be even more effective, those interested in CD control might well lobby for a Deputy U.S. Trade Representative to come from public health and to have a budget that ensures input at every step in the multiyear process. That would mean finding a public health candidate who knows the world of trade negotiation and both economic policy and private industrial investment. This is, of course, unlikely unless public health creates interdisciplinary capacity to produce such leaders. With that larger view, public health should or could exert influence at the level of policy formulation in a vast array of CD-relevant areas such as drug policy and generic categorization, tobacco and e-cigarette regulation, workforce capacity issues, and nutritional content of foods. And, of course, public health also needs to lobby for funding of CDs.",
