            "text": ", and Hanta virus hemorrhagic fever with renal and pulmonary syndrome have been highly virulent but restricted in their spread and hence have been more medical curiosities than global public health threats. Infections [ 3 5 _ T D $ D I F F ] such as drug-resistant malaria have affected large number [ 3 6 _ T D $ D I F F ] of people, but due to the demographic distribution[ 3 7 _ T D $ D I F F ] , they are more of concern in a geographically restricted region rather than being a global public health threat. Hepatitis C virus, first identified in 1989, is now the most common cause of transfusion hepatitis globally[ 3 8 _ T D $ D I F F ] , and has a tremendous global impact in terms of chronicity and risk for developing liver cirrhosis and/or liver cancer. 6 A recent report from Delhi emphasizes the importance to have a high index of suspicion for rickettsial diseases in cases of fever occurring in the monsoon and post-monsoon season in Delhi and adjoining areas[ 5 1 _ T D $ D I F F ] , as rickettsial diseases may become a serious public health problem in [ 5 2 _ T D $ D I F F ] the absence of diagnosis or misdiagnosis. 7 The perpetual nature of the emergence of infectious diseases poses a volatile ever-changing challenge[ 5 3 _ T D $ D I F F ] , and there is no doubt that new and previously unrecognized infections will continue to infect globally. It may be possible that some of these newly emerging infections could be more a function of increased detection than actual emergence in human population[ 5 4 _ T D $ D I F F ] ; the striking example of which is Legionella bacterium responsible for the high-mortality pneumonia known as Legionnaires' disease. Today, the contribution of genomics and proteomics in the discovery of new infectious diseases and in the better understanding of the pathogenesis of the existing ones has substantially improved disease surveillance[ 5 5 _ T D $ D I F F ] , and helps elucidate host susceptibility factors and host responses to treatment of infections. In response to continuous emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases, various national and international organizations [ 5 6 _ T D $ D I F F ] such as WHO, CDC, the National Institute of Health (NIH), Department of Defense[ 5 7 _ T D $ D I F F ] , and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have collaborated to develop strategic plans to combat the menace. A five pronged strategy comprising epidemic preparedness, appropriate health infrastructure, effective risk communication, research, and political commitment for partnership building has been suggested for countries of the South-East Asia region (WHO South-East Asia Regional Office, 2005). 4 ",

Laced with successes and failures[ 2 9 _ T D $ D I F F ] , India has had its share of emerging infections like those caused by Vibrio cholerae O139, Yersinia pestis, Group B Rota virus, HIV, Nipah virus, chikungunya virus, Chandipura encephalitis virus[ 3 0 _ T D $ D I F F ] , and influenza viruses.

Emerging diseases of bacterial origin [ 4 1 _ T D $ D I F F ] such as Legionnaire's disease, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Borrelia burgdorferi, V[ 4 2 _ T D $ D I F F ] . cholerae O139 have now become a common cause of concern.Re-emergence of infections is often linked to epidemiological changes. Cholera outbreaks can emerge afresh in places with poor water supply and deteriorating sanitation system.Likewise re-emergence of diptheria in certain places [ 4 3 _ T D $ D I F F ] such as the Russian Federation in 1994 was linked to a dramatic decline in immunization programs. Rift valley fever reemerged in Kenya and Somalia in 1997-1998 because of climatic change[ 4 4 _ T D $ D I F F ] , which lead to increase in vector population. Continuing threat of emergence of resistant strains of a number of important microbes, including pneumococci, enterococci, staphylococci, Plasmodium falciparum, Mycobacterium tuberculosis[ 4 5 _ T D $ D I F F ] , and HIV, due to the inappropriate use of antimicrobials on a wider scale than ever before has the potential to seriously affect the public health throughout the world. A number of chronic and neoplastic diseases are now associated with microbial infections; the most significant among them being association of persistent Chlamydia pneumonia infection with pathogenesis of coronary artery disease and gastric carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma[ 4 6 _ T D $ D I F F ] , and carcinoma cervix etiologically related to Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis B virus[ 3 0 _ T D $ D I F F ] , and human papilloma virus, respectively. Typhus is rarely diagnosed as a cause of pyrexia of intermediate duration[ 4 7 _ T D $ D I F F ] , and the public health importance of this disease is underestimated due to lack of diagnostic facilities and a low index of suspicion among health care workers due to the non[ 4 8 _ T D $ D I F F ] -specific nature of the clinical signs and symptoms. A recent Indian study[ 4 9 _ T D $ D I F F ] , which used PCR as a rapid and specific test for quick diagnosis of scrub typhus[ 5 0 _ T D $ D I F F ] , reported that scrub typhus accounts for nearly 20% of all cases of pyrexia of intermediate duration in endemic areas.",
