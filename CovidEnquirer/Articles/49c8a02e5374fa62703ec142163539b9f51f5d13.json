            "text": "To aid in the detection of various infections, the use of multiplex molecular panels for \"syndromic testing,\" i.e., the testing of specimens for multiple pathogens common to a body site, has become commonplace in the laboratory. Available panels for detection of pathogens in blood, stool, and upper respiratory tract specimens aim to provide rapid identification of bacteria and viruses and, in some instances, to provide preliminary antimicrobial resistance testing for a limited number of antibiotics. Incorporation and widespread use of various respiratory viral panels (RVPs) on nasopharyngeal swabs revolutionized how upper respiratory tract infections are diagnosed and managed. Use of RVPs led to more rapid results, improved use of antiviral treatment, and better hospital infection control practices [1] . After RVP implementation, many laboratories received RVP requests for testing lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens, such as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, to aid in the diagnosis of viral pneumonia, revealing a diagnostic gap in the syndromic testing available at the time. In response, diagnostic companies developed new molecular multiplex panels for the diagnosis of pneumonia. These panels primarily focus on improving the detection of bacterial pathogens from BAL fluid, sputum, and endotracheal aspirates. Traditional cultures are the gold standard for the detection and diagnosis of pneumonia; however, culture is not a very sensitive method, even when performed from high-quality samples [2] . Given the enhanced sensitivity of molecular methods, the use of a multiplex lower respiratory panel (LRP) could significantly improve upon current culture techniques. This review presents the current and upcoming commercial assays and discusses practical matters the laboratory should consider when deploying testing with an LRP.",

Using a combination of multiplex targets (Table 1) , Gadsby et al. developed an LDT that panel can detect as many as 26 pathogens from sputum and endotracheal aspirates. Semiquantification for a subset of bacterial targets is achieved using a standard curve generated by serial dilutions of plasmids containing each gene target, which is used to back-calculate to the bacterial density in terms of CFU per milliliter [4] . A cutoff value was applied, so that any pathogen density of \u226510 5 CFU/ml was considered clinically significant. Using this cutoff, 81.1% of the samples were positive for a respiratory pathogen, while 71.5% were positive for a bacterial pathogen [4] . While there was high concordance between this bacterial PCR and standard culture (127/125; 98.4%), Haemophilus influenzae was missed by the PCR in two samples. Additionally, 27 (8.4%) samples grew bacteria that were not included on the PCR panel.",

Semiquantitation allows the interpretation of relative densities of specific bacteria to aid in the clinical interpretation of the molecular results. The semi-quantitative function is achieved by utilizing a binning algorithm based on the relative amount of quantitated target PCR amplicon compared to a known concentration of an internal standard [10] . The limit of quantification ranges from <10 4 to \u226510 7 copies/ml, with values of <10 3.5 copies/ml considered a negative result. A negative result is similar to that of traditional quantitative BAL fluid culture, where only colonies that are \u226510 4 /CFU/ml are considered clinically significant [11] . Each bin in the algorithm represents a density range of about 1 log unit, with upper and lower limits (i.e., 10 4 bin = 10 3.5 to 10 4.5 ) [12] . Additionally, resistance markers are reported only if the bacterial species that can harbor the resistance gene is present at a density above the cutoff (i.e., samples that are only Pseudomonas aeruginosa positive would not report mecA resistance).",

The Unyvero system consists of a lysator instrument for prepping the sample, an analyzer for testing the cartridge, and a cockpit system for controlling the process and interfacing with the laboratory information system (LIS). The cleared LRT panel contains 19 bacterial targets and 10 markers of resistance (Table  1) . Importantly, the system does not provide any type of quantitative information, simply reporting the presence or absence of the target. To date, the most extensive study was a multicenter clinical trial study that tested 603 prospective tracheal aspirate samples [15] . In this study, 312 samples were positive for 1 or more pathogens. The overall weighted sensitivity for organism identification compared to culture was 92.5%, with a range of positive agreement of 25 to100%. Excluding organisms with fewer than 10 identifications in the sample set (7 of 16), the range of positive agreement was 87.5 to100%. The weighted specificity was 97.4%, with a range of negative agreement from 92.5 to 99.7%. Importantly, of the 239 positive LRT detections, 213 (89%) were confirmed via targeted PCR followed by bidirectional sequencing. For determination of resistance markers, the LRT had an overall weighted sensitivity of 93%, with a range of positive agreement ranging from 85.7 to 100%. The overall weighted specificity was 98.8%, with a negative percent agreement range from 86.9 to100%. Contrived samples were utilized to augment low-frequency targets and had a range of positive agreement of 86 to 100%.",

The molecular revolution in microbiology has had a significant impact by allowing quicker identification of potential pathogens, which results in downstream benefits, such as improved antibiotic utilization. One small retrospective study was conducted to assess the potential impact of the FAPP on antimicrobial modification and prescribing versus standard of care culture and PCR methods. The study found that for 47.9% of the patients, use of the assay could result in more appropriate antibiotic de-escalation and a significant reduction in time to deescalation [14] . Use of the FAPP to guide antibiotic therapy was estimated to have a minimal risk for inappropriate modifications [17] . Of note, the study also found that for 46.9% of the patients, there was no potential change in therapy if the FAPP was used. A single-center study performed at Beaumont Hospital in Michigan reported on the theoretical impact of the LRT panel on the management of patients with suspected pneumonia [18] . This study utilized information from the panel that was submitted to the FDA and so included some targets not ultimately approved. An infectious disease physician evaluated patient charts as to the appropriateness of antibiotic therapy concerning their final cultured organism at the time the LRT result would have been available. Only 15% of patients had appropriate antibiotics at the time an LRT result would have been available, with 63% being overtreated and 22% undertreated. Seventy-six percent of the undertreated cohort were modifiable based on an LRT result.",

Indeed, the LDT was able to detect bacteria in 77.6% of the pre-treated patients, while culture was positive in only 32.1% [4] . As with the FAPP, the biggest impact of the LDT was in the potential for more appropriate de-escalation of antimicrobials (77.2% of the patients). There was a smaller impact on the potential for escalation (5.9%), and 16.9% had no potential change.

Similar to other multiplex panels, an LRP includes a large number of targets, which raises the concern of variable sensitivities of each target, some of which may be unacceptable. Variable detection appears to be present for some viral and antibiotic resistance targets on the FAPP [13] . While this may not discourage the laboratory from implementing these panels, it is important to be aware of sensitivity issues when determining the utility of the panel for certain patient populations, interpretation of negative results, and obtaining a reliable negative predictive value. Furthermore, the breadth of these panels results in the inclusion of targets that are clinically distinct and that often apply to specific patient populations. The inclusion of both hospital-acquired and community-acquired pathogens presents a challenge in deciding when and on which patients the test should be performed.",

Endotracheal aspirates undergo a similar quality check via Gram stain, where the presence or absence of bacteria in the context of white blood cell quantity is used [20, 21] . While there are internal controls included on these panels, they do not serve as a specimen quality assessment, and no targets for white blood cells or squamous cells are included.

An advantage to traditional culture is its unbiased nature, with both commensals and pathogens recovered. Interpretation of pathogen significance from an LRT specimen is often guided by the presence (or absence) of normal flora and its amount compared to the pathogen in question. This is especially true for those organisms that are both colonizers and opportunistic pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis, and H. influenzae. Determination of these organisms as true pathogens is often challenging, particularly for pediatric patients, where colonization rates are higher than for adults. Placing the density of these potential pathogens in the context of the density of normal flora is helpful for clinicians when attempting to identify the cause of pneumonia. While the semi-quantitative bacterial results aim to address this concern, assays still lack the ability to definitively interpret organisms that are colonizers. This issue is also a potential problem for patients who have chronic tracheostomies, where over time, the tracheostomy tube becomes colonized, commonly with Gram-negative bacteria. This condition is currently a challenge for proper interpretation of traditional endotracheal aspirate cultures and could be even more confounding when using the LRP.",

Formation of diagnostic stewardship teams that include clinical microbiology, antibiotic stewardship pharmacists, infection control practitioners, and infectious disease physicians will be beneficial to establish institutional practices guidelines for LRP implementation, thereby ensuring the prudent and appropriate use of LRPs.
