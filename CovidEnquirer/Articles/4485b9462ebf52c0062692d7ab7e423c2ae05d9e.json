It is clear that preexisting maternal immunity 66 impacts the incidence of congenital infection, as 30-40% of HCMV-seronegative women that 67 acquire the virus during pregnancy transmit the infection to the fetus in utero in contrast to 1-2% 68 following superinfection of HCMV-seroimmune women (3). Furthermore, infants born to HCMV-69 seropositive women are also less likely to exhibit symptoms of congenital infection at birth and 70 can have milder neurologic sequelae (6, 7). Therefore, many hypothesize that a maternal 71 vaccine that prevents maternal HCMV acquisition, protects against viral transmission to the 72 infant, or reduces the severity of congenital infection is an achievable goal (8-10). Given the 73 global burden of disease of congenital HCMV, such a vaccine remains a Tier 1 priority of the 74 National Academy of Medicine (11).75 A variety of candidate HCMV vaccine approaches have been attempted, including live 76 attenuated virus (12, 13), glycoprotein subunit formulations (14, 15), viral vectors (16, 17), and 77 single/bivalent DNA plasmids (18, 19). Importantly, the HCMV glycoprotein B (gB) subunit 78 vaccine administered with MF59 squalene adjuvant demonstrated moderate (~50%) efficacy in 79 preventing primary HCMV infection in cohorts of both postpartum (14) and adolescent women 80 (15). Furthermore, this vaccine demonstrated a protective benefit against HCMV viremia and 81 reduced clinical need for antiviral treatment in transplant recipients (20). gB is the viral fusogen 82 which facilitates the fusion of viral envelope and host membrane during viral entry (21). This 83 glycoprotein is essential for entry into all cell types, including trophoblast progenitor cells (22), 84 and is a known target of neutralizing antibodies (23, 24).
