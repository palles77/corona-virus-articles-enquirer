            "text": "[OPV]) was originally considered to infect milking cows and to have zoonotic potential. Because of its relationship to variola virus and immunologic crossreaction, cowpox virus was used to protect humans against smallpox (1) . Later, vaccinia virus, another OPV with unknown origin, was used as a vaccine virus through the global smallpox eradication campaign, and cowpox virus infections became less common in cattle, other animals, and humans. However, during recent decades, cowpox virus infections have reemerged in domestic cats and other animals, including wild animals in captivity (2) (3) (4) , and have increased in humans subsequent to transmission from cats, rodents, zoo animals, and circus animals (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . Cowpox virus seems to be restricted to Eurasia, but spread of poxviruses to new regions through relocation of their natural host species is possible (10) .",

Since 1978, cowpox virus infections have been diagnosed in domestic cats in several European countries (13) (14) (15) (16) ; the cats were probably infected by contact with rodents, and in some cases infections were transmitted to humans (16) (17) (18) . Serologic surveys and detection of OPV DNA by PCR have indicated that wild rodents and shrews are likely reservoir hosts of cowpox virus in western Europe (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) , although infectious virus has never been isolated from these animals.",

The southernmost part of Sweden belongs to the broad-leaf forest region of central Europe but is mainly cultivated. Lynx typically live in forested areas and are found throughout most of Scandinavia. They may come close to human settlements. Although their main prey are roe deer, they also prey on reindeer and sheep. Furthermore, debilitated lynx affected by sarcoptic mange and orphans searching for easily accessible food are often found around human settlements. Interactions between diseased lynx and domestic cats and dogs have been documented (30, 31) .",

Numbers of males and females were equal in the juvenile and adult age classes, but within subadults there were more males (n = 68) than females (n = 27).

We cannot rule out the possibility that the OPV tk sequences obtained from lynx were derived from other OPVs apart from cowpox virus; but although the phylogeny is based on a partial sequence of a single gene, which may have restrictions as a predictor of phylogenetic relationships (35) , we suggest that the tk OPV sequences obtained from the lynx in this study were probably derived from cowpox virus. This assumption is based on the fact that the lynx tk sequences were 100% identical with the partial tk gene of several cowpox virus isolates ( Figure 2 and data not shown) and is also supported by the phylogenetic analysis, which showed that the lynx tk gene sequences formed a common clade with those of CPXV-GRI (strain GRI-90 isolated from a person infected by contact with a mole) (36) and of isolates from 1 person (No.H1) and 1 felid (No.F1) from Norway ( Figure 3 ). Given the general genetic heterogeneity of cowpox virus isolates (35, 37) , it is not surprising that the clade containing the OPV tk sequences from lynx diverged from that of some other cowpox virus isolates, such as CPXV-BR and the 2 isolates from persons in Sweden (Swe.HI and Swe. H2; Figure 3) . Unexpectedly, the OPV sequences obtained from the lynx in Sweden were similar to the 2 isolates from a person and a felid in Norway and less similar to 2 isolates from persons in Sweden. A potential explanation is that none of these 4 clinical cases occurred near the sites in which the lynx were sampled for this study. In Sweden, the 2 human cases appeared in Sk\u00e5ne, the southernmost part of the country, 150-200 km from the southernmost region where the lynx were sampled. In Norway, all feline cases and all but 1 human case occurred in the southwestern part of the country, far from the common mountainous Sweden-Norway border, the region where most lynx are found. Recently, only 1 case of cowpox virus in a human has been identifi ed in this region (Nordland County, Norway).",

A similar association with human presence has already been observed with regard to seropositivity to T. gondii in some lynx in this study (29) . In contrast, previous studies (1999) of other pathogens in some of the lynx (n = 70) included in this study suggested that contacts between lynx and domestic cats are uncommon; seroprevalence of antibodies against feline parvovirus was low; and feline leukemia virus antigen and antibodies against feline coronavirus, calicivirus, herpesvirus, and feline immunodefi ciency virus were absent (28) . Assuming that lynx are susceptible to these feline pathogens, this difference may be explained by the fact that domestic cats are commonly vaccinated against these viral infections but not against T. gondii and OPVs. Nevertheless, these results may suggest only limited contact between domestic cats and lynx, pointing at wild rodents and possibly shrews as the direct source of the OPV infection for lynx. Among the 24 animals that were OPV-positive by PCR, 5 (21%) had sarcoptic mange, whereas the total prevalence of mange among the 264 animals included in this study was 6.4%; this fi nding indicates a possible relationship between OPV infection and infestation with S. scabiei. The severe epidermal lesions and breakage of the skin barrier might predispose the animals to infection by OPVs, such as cowpox virus, and such viruses might contribute to the severity of sarcoptic mange in lynx. Alternatively, altered behavior in diseased lynx could infl uence exposure to infection. In contrast to healthy lynx, those with mange are commonly found in human settlements, where they sometimes prey on domestic animals, including cats and dogs (30) .",

This study also provides further evidence that OPV, presumably cowpox virus, is widely distributed in ecosystems in Sweden. This fi nding may be relevant for vaccination strategies (39) , especially when considering the use of OPVs as vectors in genetically recombinant vaccines and their ability to undergo spontaneous genetic recombinations with virus relatives when replicating in the same cells of a host. Moreover, our fi ndings indicate that the role of OPVs, such as cowpox virus, as potential human pathogens may increase, considering their broad distribution in ecosystems, the cessation of smallpox vaccination of humans, and an increasing number of immunocompromised persons. Thus, targeted surveillance of rodent species, and the carnivores that prey on them, is necessary for monitoring the emergence or reemergence of these viruses as potential human pathogens. Further genetic studies are needed to determine whether the detected virus in the free-ranging lynx population in Scandinavia is indeed cowpox virus. ",
