            "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses. Their envelope accommodates three viral membrane proteins. The membrane (M) protein, the subject of this study, is the most abundant envelope protein. The spike (S) protein is involved in binding to the viral receptors and in entry of the virus during the initial stage of infection. The envelope (E) protein is a minor viral component but it is essential for particle assembly. Within the virion envelope a nucleocapsid is present in which the plus-stranded RNA genome is packaged. The M proteins of all coronaviruses are glycosylated. While the group I viruses such as transmissible gastroenteritis virus [TGEV] and the group III viruses (infectious bronchitis virus [IBV] ) have M proteins with only N-linked sugars, in the group II viruses (e.g. in mouse hepatitis virus [MHV] ) the M protein is invariably O-glycosylated. The MHV M protein, which localizes to the Golgi when expressed alone, is a type III membrane protein (22 -25 kDa) with a short (ap-proximately 25 residues) amino-terminal ectodomain and with its carboxy-terminal half located on the inside of virions, which corresponds to the cytoplasmic side of cellular membranes (Rottier, 1995) . It contains a cluster of four hydroxylamino acids at its extreme amino terminus, where the O-linked sugars are attached. The oligosaccharides are synthesized by the sequential addition of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), galactose and sialic acid, followed sometimes by the addition of one or two unidentified sugars (Krijnse Locker et al., 1992) . The linkage of the initial GalNAc to the polypeptide in O-glycosylation is carried out by members of the GalNAc-transferase family (Clausen and Bennet, 1996) . The maturation of the sugar side chain can be followed easily in biochemical experiments as every sugar gives rise to an electrophoretically detectable shift.",

Wild-type (WT) and mutant M proteins were expressed in OST7-1 cells, pulse-labeled and chased. The appearance of electrophoretically slower migrating M protein species during the chase indicates the addition of O-linked sugars. Since none of the single substitutions of the hydroxylamino acids abolished O-glycosylation, multiple or alternative acceptor sites apparently exist. Only the mutant in which both threonines were substituted remained unmodified. We next prepared an additional set of M proteins with mutations in the cluster of hydroxylamino acids leaving only one threonine residue (Table 1) . It appeared that the M protein could be modified at both its threonines, indicating the presence of alternative acceptor Table 1 Mutant sites. Since the threonine at position 5 was glycosylated more efficiently than threonine at position 4, threonine 5 is the most likely candidate acceptor residue for O-glycosylation in WT M. Mutant M proteins with only one acceptor site made a similar shift in electrophoretic mobility as WT M, indicating that in WT M only one residue at a time is modified by O-linked sugars.",

The results indicate that a cluster of hydroxyl-amino acids per se is not required. Furthermore, the identity of the hydroxyl-amino acid at position 4 or 5 is not essential, since an M protein containing serine residues instead of threonine was still glycosylated. Also the distance with respect to the initiating methionine appeared not to be important. Furthermore, none of the amino acid substitutions downstream of the hydroxylamino acid cluster blocked O-glycosylation of the M protein. However, the presence of the proline 3 residues downstream of the functional acceptor site is beneficial for O-glycosylation. Altogether these results suggest that a specific sequence motif does not occur but that the requirements for O-glycosylation are flexible.",

We therefore decided to study this issue. We used an in situ O-glycosylation assay which allowed us to analyse the primary sequence requirements of three different GalNAc-transferases using MHV M as the substrate. The in situ assay is based on the co-expression of ER-retained forms of the GalNAc-transferases T1, T2, or T3 and of the substrate (R\u00f6 ttger et al., 1998) . Gal-NAc-transferases are normally localized to the Golgi complex.

The results indicate that the three GalNActransferases have largely overlapping, but distinct substrate specificities. They presumably explain why an in vivo O-glycosylation consensus sequence could not be identified. Finally, the results support the hypothesis that O-glycosylation of proteins is determined by the combined activities of all GalNAc-transferases present in particular cells. The differential expression of GalNAc transferases glycosylation in cells or tissues of the organism might thus be a mechanism to modulate the O-glycosylation of proteins.",

To examine the role of glycosylation of the ectodomain of the M protein, mutations expected to either ablate glycosylation or alter the glycosylation type were directly introduced into the genome of MHV by targeted RNA recombination. In this way, recombinant viruses were generated that carried M proteins that were either O-glycosylated (Alb138), N-glycosylated (Alb244), or not glycosylated at all (Alb248). Af- ter confirmation of their genotypes and protein phenotypes, the recombinant viruses were analyzed for their in vitro growth properties. The recombinant viruses displayed no obvious differences with respect to plaque size or growth in tissue culture and exhibited similar one-step growth characteristics (Fig. 1A ). Next we determined the virulence of the recombinant viruses using intracranial inoculation of C57Bl/6 mice. All recombinant viruses appeared to have the same LD50 or virulence and they replicated to the same titers in the brain (Fig. 1B) . Similar results were obtained when the mice were inoculated intranasally. Apparently, the M protein glycosylation state is not an important virulence factor.",

Type I interferons (including IFNa) are an important component of the first line of defense against virus infections. For TGEV, the oligosaccharides N-linked to the M protein were demonstrated earlier to be important for efficient IFNa induction (Laude et al., 1992) . Mutations in the M protein ectodomain that impaired N-glycosylation decreased the interferogenic activity. In view of these results we tested the interferogenic capacity of our recombinant MHVs (Fig. 2) . Coronaviruses containing M proteins with N- Porcine peripheral blood mononuclear (PBM) cells were induced to produce IFNa by overnight incubation on the TGEV-or MHV-infected fixed cells. Supernatants were collected and serial log 2 dilutions of supernatants from induced PBM cells were assayed for IFN activity on LMR cells using vesicular stomatitis virus as a challenge. The IFN produced by the porcine PBM cells was characterized as mainly consisting of IFNa because it was neutralized for over 90% by an anti-IFNa serum (Laude et al., 1992) . linked sugars appeared to induce type I IFN to higher levels than viruses carrying M proteins with O-linked sugars. MHV with unglycosylated M proteins appeared to be a poor IFN inducer.",

No unique sequence motif for Oglycosylation could be identified, which is conceivably due to the presence of multiple GalNAc-transferases. Indeed, MHV M served as a substrate for three GalNAc-transferases in an in situ glycosylation assay. Recombinant viruses were generated that carried M proteins that were either O-glycosylated, N-glycosylated, or not glycosylated at all. The M protein glycosylation state appeared not to influence the tissue culture growth characteristics of recombinant viruses. Also no differences could be detected in the virulence and the in vivo growth characteristics of the recombinant viruses. However, MHV containing M proteins with N-linked sugars displayed a significantly higher interferogenic capacity than virus carrying O-glycosylated M proteins, while MHV with unglycosylated M proteins appeared to be a poor IFN inducer.",

Most intriguing is the question why the different coronaviruses have so strictly conserved the particular glycosylation of their M protein and for what biological reason. Our results suggest that it has to do with the modulation of an antiviral immune response. However, the advantage of such responses for the viruses remains enigmatic.",
