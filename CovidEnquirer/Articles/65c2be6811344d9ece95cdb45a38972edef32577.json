At present, the field suffers a serious credibility problem. Critics acknowledge the conceptual beauty of using finely crafted self-replicating molecular machines to seek and destroy locoregional or systemic deposits of cancer, but point to the fact that the host immune response will inevitably prove to be an insuperable barrier to effective systemic therapy. In addition, to many observers oncolytic virotherapy is tarred with the same brush as gene therapy, a discipline that was seen to offer much, but deliver little, in the 1980s and 1990s.",

Many of the new agents that are now held as exemplars of the power of biomedical science to deliver therapeutic benefits had a circuitous and often rocky road to clinical approval. The first set of lessons comes from the clinical development of monoclonal antibodies [1] . Following their It is time for those working on oncolytic viruses to take stock of the status of the field. We now have at our disposal an array of potential therapeutic agents, and are beginning to conduct early-phase clinical trials in patients with relapsed/metastatic cancers. By drawing on lessons learned during the development of other biological therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies and targeted small molecule inhibitors, we are now in a position to chart the course of the next wave of trials that will go beyond the phase I studies of safety and feasibility. In this article we review our approach to the development of oncolytic viruses as cancer therapeutics. In doing so, we emphasise the fact that this process is modular and involves multiple iterative steps between the laboratory and the clinic. Ultimately, at least in the medium term, the future of oncolytic virotherapy lies in combination regimens with standard anti-cancer agents such as radiation and chemotherapy.",

            "text": "initial description [2] there was huge enthusiasm for their potential as specific and selective anti-cancer drugs, based on their ability to target unique tumour-associated antigens. However, the first wave of expectancy yielded to emerging despondency as it became clear that systemically administered antibodies failed to reach their targets on tumour tissue in high concentrations [3] . The reasons for this will be familiar to virotherapists: attrition through non-specific or specific adsorption in non-target tissues and immune-mediated clearance of foreign antigens (early monoclonal antibodies were frequently murine in origin) accounted for the vast majority of the injected antibody dose. The human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) response altered the pharmacokinetics of subsequent antibody infusions and also exposed patients to the risk of immune-mediated adverse events [4] . In some quarters there was a sense that antibodies would fail to make a mark in the clinical arena. However, as scientists and clinicians wrestled with these problems, there emerged two clear strands of thought: (i) the immune response against the monoclonal antibody was seen as potentially therapeutic in its own right [5] ; and (ii) efforts were made to reduce the immunogenicity of the antibody molecule by making it less visible to the immune system [6, 7] . Again, these considerations will be very familiar to those working in the field of virotherapy, and have direct parallels to the current debate on the role of the immune response in oncolytic virotherapy. On one hand, there is persuasive data showing that an intact immune system is required for oncolytic virotherapy in order to mediate optimal antitumoural efficacy, and there are those who espouse the view that oncolytic virotherapy is essentially a form of immunotherapy [reviewed in 8]. On the other hand, there are studies that suggest that judicious suppression of the immune response can significantly improve systemic delivery of oncolytic virotherapy with resultant enhancement of intratumoural viral replication and treatment efficacy [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

Studies were performed in which attempts were made to blunt the HAMA response by administering anti-T cell immunosuppressive drugs [6, 7] , but these had relatively little success. It was only through the generation of chimeric murine/ human or fully humanised monoclonal antibodies that these agents have been able to enter the clinic in large numbers [13] . Indeed, a number of monoclonal antibodies have been licensed for routine clinical use against malignant (and other) diseases. Clearly, corresponding ''humanization'' of viral proteins is not going to be possible, but there are a number of ways in which antigenic epitopes may be masked from the immune system, either by loading the viruses onto human carrier cells [14, 15] or by cloaking them in surface polymers [16] .",

In the last 5 years, a number of these agents have demonstrated their efficacy in randomised phase II and III trials and have received approvals from regulatory agencies. However, with the exception of the very rare diseases that are reliant on defects in a single signalling pathway (e.g. gastrointestinal stromal tumour and c-Kit), many of these agents show only modest single-agent activity against established treatment-resistant cancers. Furthermore, even when they show dramatic single-agent efficacy, this is inevitably followed by the emergence of treatment resistance as a result of adaptive genetic alteration(s) in the tumour [17] . As a result of these considerations, it is now widely accepted that the future development of targeted therapies will occur as part of combination therapeutic regimens in which they are used alongside standard anti-cancer therapies such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy.",

The oncolytic nature of reovirus was first recognised when wild-type reovirus was shown to replicate in transformed, but not normal, cells [27] . Cells expressing high levels of EGFR and v-erbB (a truncated mutant of EGFR) were shown to be susceptible to reovirus infection and cytotoxicity [28] [29] [30] . Detailed analysis demonstrated that an activated Ras pathway, a signalling pathway downstream of EGFR, was a prerequisite of sensitivity to reovirus. The Ras pathway is frequently activated in cancers, either through mutation of the RAS gene or overexpression/mutational activation of EGFR [31] .",

Despite this fact, those of us who enrol patients in clinical trials can attest that there is a real willingness among patients to hear about the potential for using these ancient foes for therapeutic benefit. Indeed, it is the authors' collective personal experience that very few patients are discouraged from taking part in such studies merely because the proposed study agent is a virus.

As a result, clinical studies tend to be conducted under conditions of stringent biosafety, with detailed analysis of the risk of vector shedding and environmental contamination by the study agent. Unfortunately, at the local level, there can be significant variability in the operational characteristics of the safety committees that are set up to supervise trials involving genetically modified organisms.

As such, they represent a huge hurdle for small biotechnology companies to clear, and require significant financial investment, often with only a modest chance of achieving sufficiently eyecatching results to guarantee progression to phase II evaluation. In early examples of such trials, concerns about the perceived risks of administering live viruses to cancer patients led to regulators insisting on extraordinarily cautious dose-escalation schemes, such that trials took a very long time to reach dose levels where biological effects might have been anticipated [35] . Thankfully, the literature now contains a sufficient body of reassuring data from a number of phase I studies of oncolytic virotherapy to assuage some of the concerns of regulators. Nonetheless, it is likely that new viral agents, especially if they are first-in-family, will still have to go through relatively laborious early stage clinical development. (3). In cells that contain normal wild-type RAS genes, the presence of dsRNA leads to phosphorylation of PKR (4) and subsequent activation of eIF2a (5) . This in turn leads to shutdown of viral protein synthesis, thus aborting a productive infection (6) . In contrast, in cells with mutant RAS or an activated Ras pathway, PKR remains in a hypophosphorylated form (7) and viral RNA species are able to direct synthesis and assembly of daughter virions (8).",

In view of concerns about viral excretion and environmental contamination, the study included detailed analysis of blood, urine, fecal and urinary samples by reverse transcription PCR. These analyses confirmed negativity of all pre-and post-treatment blood, urine, saliva and fecal samples for reovirus using RT-PCR screening based on 25 cycles of amplification, and this was used for decision-making regarding the patients' suitability for discharge from the hospital. Subse-quent re-analysis of the data based on 35 cycles of amplification (where the detection limit was 200 TCID 50 ) revealed weak positive signals in the first cycle of reovirus treatment in a small number of patients at days 5 and 15.

Furthermore, in therapeutic experiments the activity of intravenous reovirus was only modest (at best) against B16 as lung metastases or subcutaneous tumours. In light of previous studies that had reported improved activity from combining the immunosuppressive agent cyclophosphamide with oncolytic virotherapy [9-11], we tested this approach in our Specifically, data that emerged from the initial phase I study of intravenous viral administration provided essential data on the immune effects in patients. These results were used to design studies in the laboratory that ultimately provided a mechanism for attempting to modulate the NARA response with cyclophosphamide.

By combining intravenous reovirus with high-dose cyclophosphamide (150 mg/kg for 3 days), many of the barriers to effective intratumoural delivery and replication were overcome. In biodistribution studies, viral titers of between 10 7 and 10 8 pfu per mg were recovered from B16 tumours. In therapeutic studies this was associated with marked tumour regressions in the first 2 weeks of therapy, but this was followed by the death of the animals. Unfortunately, and surprisingly, it was found that titerable virus could also be recovered from the circulation and a number of normal tissues, most notably from the heart. Levels of recovery of reovirus from cardiac tissues were consistent with reoviral replication within cardiac myocytes, and histological evaluation demonstrated severe non-suppurative myocarditis. It emerged that these toxicities were occurring due to the absence of circulating NARA in mice treated with high-dose cyclophosphamide. Further studies of systemic reovirus administration in B6.129S2-Igh-6tm1Cgn/j mice which lack mature B cells and fail to make anti-viral antibodies confirmed that similar severe toxicities occurred and were due to viral replication in systemic organs.",

First, radiation may increase the ability of reovirus to infect tumour cells by affecting the expression of cell surface receptors. A similar effect has been observed in adenovirus infection after Fig. 3 . Scheme of delivery of cyclophosphamide and reovirus (REOLYSIN) in phase I study of immunomodulatory therapy. Cyclophosphamide is delivered 3 days before a 5day cycle of reovirus with cycles repeated each 4 weeks. The \u00c01 dose level was written into the protocol in case dose-limiting toxicity was encountered in cohort 1, but was not needed during study conduct. therapeutic irradiation [42, 43] . Second, cells with mutated Ras will be relatively radioresistant, but should be sensitive to reovirusinduced oncolysis. Third, the stress response in irradiated cells involves increased signaling through the EGFR-Ras pathway, and this, too, should enhance reoviral replication/cytotoxicity. Fourth, radiation-induced alterations in the proportions of tumour cells at different phases of the cell cycle may render them more permissive to reovirus infection and/or replication. Fifth, in the in vivo setting, radiation may reduce the high tumour interstitial pressure that is a significant barrier to effective intratumoural spread of biological particles such as viruses [3] .",

We initially demonstrated that reovirus is not significantly inactivated, even by large single fractions of X-ray irradiation up to 25 Gy. There was some minor reovirus cytotoxicity at higher radiation doses (50 and 100 Gy), but such radiation doses are not clinically relevant. Thereafter, we showed that there was enhanced cytotoxicity when radiation was combined with reovirus across a broad range of multiplicities of infection (MOI) (0.001-10) in a panel of 11 tumour cell lines. The effect of the combination treatment was most marked at low MOI and in cell lines that showed only modest susceptibility to reovirus cytotoxicity in the absence of radiation. We proceeded to examine the nature of the co-operative interaction between radiation and reovirus using the combination index methodology of Chou and Talalay [45] . Strong synergism was demonstrated for tumour cells exposed to 3, 5 and 10 Gy radiation and reovirus at MOI between 0.001 and 1. Contrary to our initial hypothesis that radiation may alter the signalling environment within the cell to make it more conducive to reoviral replication, there was no evidence of enhanced replication of reovirus in irradiated cell lines. The cellular mechanism underlying the observed increased cytotoxicity of the combination therapy was through an increase in apoptosis. Finally, the combination therapy was tested in three separate animal models, including both immunodeficient and immunocompetent systems. For all three models there was evidence that intratumoural injections of reovirus were able to significantly enhance the therapeutic efficacy of fractionated courses of radiation.",

The secondary goals included assessing viral biodistribution and excretion (blood, urine, stool, sputum), reoviral replication in tumours and anti-viral immune responses. Eligible patients included those with measurable disease that was amenable to palliative radiotherapy. In order to maximise the information that would be available from the study, we chose to adopt a novel two-stage design (Fig. 4) . In the first stage, patients received radiotherapy at a dose of 20 Gy in 5 fractions, plus two intratumoural injections of reovirus at doses between 10 8 and 10 10 TCID 50 . In the second stage, the radiotherapy dose was increased to 36 Gy in 12 fractions and the patients received two, four or six doses of reovirus at a stable dose of 10 10 TCID 50 . We recruited 23 patients with a variety of solid tumours. Reassuringly, dose-limiting toxicity was not seen in any of the cohorts and the combination treatment was not associated with exacerbation of the acute radiation reaction. As with the phase I study of intravenous reovirus, we conducted a rigorous programme to check for shedding of the virus from injected patients. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) studies of blood, urine, stool and sputum were negative in all cases. Of the patients treated in the 20 Gy radiation group, 2 of 7 evaluable patients had a partial response (PR) and 5 had stable disease (SD). In the group of patients treated to 36 Gy in 12 fractions, 5 of 7 evaluable patients had a PR and 2 had SD. This study has shown that the combination of intratumoural reovirus and radiotherapy is well tolerated and shows a favourable toxicity profile. The absence of vector shedding from injected patients means that this approach can easily be applied to an out-patient setting. However, the patient population that was studied precluded any formal analysis of the potential efficacy of the approach, and this should be evaluated in patients with newly diagnosed cancers who are receiving radiotherapy with curative intent.",

The addition of cisplatin (10 or 100 mM) significantly enhanced tumour kill compared to reovirus alone across a range of MOIs (0.01-1), and subsequent isobolographic analyses [45] confirmed that the interaction was synergistic, particularly for cisplatin and paclitaxel. The mechanism of enhanced cell kill was through an increase in apoptosis, and in vivo studies confirmed that there were greater levels of viral replication in tumours recovered from animals that received the combination therapy. We have also completed similar studies in prostate and head and neck cancer cell lines. In the former, taxanes have been shown to be synergistic with reovirus [Pandha HS, personal communication], and in the latter, both platins and Based on the data from the phase I study of intravenous reovirus and the in vitro data on the synergistic interactions between reovirus, cisplatin and paclitaxel, we designed a phase I study in which all three agents were combined in patients with locally advanced disease. In view of concerns about potential viral toxicity in patients receiving full-dose cytotoxic chemotherapy, the virus was again administered according to a doseescalation scheme. However, the starting dose was reduced by only one log from the recommended single-agent phase II dose. Thus, in the initial phase I study, cohorts of 3 patients received escalating doses (3 \u00c2 10 9 , 1 \u00c2 10 10 , 3 \u00c2 10 10 TCID 50 ) of reovirus on days 1-5, in combination with carboplatin (area under the curve = 5) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m 2 over 3 h), which were administered on day 1 of a 3-weekly schedule. Patients with a variety of advanced cancers which were not amenable to curative treatment, or which were refractory to standard therapy, were treated. Having completed the dose-escalation phase I component of the study, a phase II study in patients with head and neck cancers was performed. In the dose-escalation portion of the study, there were no dose-limiting toxicities. In the 19 patients with head and neck cancer who received at least two cycles of treatment and were thus evaluable for response, PR was seen in 8 patients (42%), SD in 6 (32%) and PD in 5 (26%). Most of these patients had head and neck cancers that were refractory to previous platinum-based chemotherapy. A confirmatory US-based study in the same patient group is currently recruiting patients. These findings have prompted a successful submission to the Federal Drug Administration for a Special Protocol Agreement to test the combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel and reovirus versus carboplatin, paclitaxel and placebo in a randomised phase III trial in patients with platinum-refractory relapsed/metastatic head and neck cancer (Fig. 5 ).",

Reovirus has been used for the purpose of illustration because, at present, it represents the agent that has progressed the furthest along the track to clinical assessment. This progress has been backed up by an extensive preclinical and clinical package, in which the agent has been assessed as a stand-alone therapeutic and in combination regimens with radiotherapy or chemotherapy. At all stages, progress has been facilitated and accelerated by pursuing a modular and iterative approach, such that lessons learned in the laboratory can be applied in the clinic and vice versa. We believe that this model will be useful to other oncolytic viral therapies as they move forward in the clinic beyond the phase I setting.",
