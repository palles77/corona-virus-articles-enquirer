Clinicians should be reminded that rhinovirus can cause severe lower respiratory tract infection, including death, as documented in several LTCF outbreaks (10, 11) . These data highlight the need for molecular capacity to diagnose rhinovirus infection because detection is otherwise limited to less sensitive viral culture systems. This review of outbreaks predominantly involving elderly persons in LTCFs highlights the sparing of older persons by pandemic (H1N1) 2009. Possible explanations include cross-protective antibodies from previous exposure to infl uenza A (H1N1) strains circulating before the antigenic shift of infl uenza A to subtype H2N2 in 1957 or minimal contact with those most likely to have imported the pandemic strain into Canada (young travelers) (12) . In addition, older persons may have less contact with the age group (children 10-19 years of age), with most cases being in Ontario. Our fi ndings support Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for vaccination with monovalent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus vaccine. These guidelines have not placed older persons in a high priority group for vaccination because increased rates of hospitalization and severe disease caused by pandemic (H1N1) 2009 have not been observed (13, 14) . Investment in multiplex technologies to investigate respiratory outbreaks in LTCFs shortens time for pathogen detection, helps guide infection control and vaccination policies, and can potentially save resources spent on other investigations.",
