However, recent advances, especially in the last 15 years in genomics, proteomics, biotechnology, immunology, pathogenesis, and vaccine formulation and delivery have dramatically changed our approach to vaccine development.

For example, the USDA recognizes these varying levels of protection in the way that they allow label claims: (1) \" aids in disease control, \" (2) \" for the prevention of disease, \" and (3) \" for the prevention of infection. \" Additionally there may be indirect protection, or herd immunity, that results from vaccination of sufficient numbers of animals in a given population resulting in the reduction of the ability of a disease to transmit through the vaccinated individuals. The perception that vaccines provide sterilizing immunity, where the disease agent does not establish an infection, while widely held, is generally unfounded and largely unrealistic. Recent advances, especially in the last 15 years in genomics, proteomics, biotechnology, immunology, pathogenesis, and vaccine formulation and delivery have dramatically changed our approach to vaccine development. When used optimally, vaccines have been shown to prevent disease, reduce the need for pharmaceutical intervention, and improve the health and welfare of animals, and indirectly people as well. The challenge in developing an optimal vaccination program is in dealing with the great diversity that exists within the animal world, and as such there probably is no single optimal program for all occasions. While there is no magic solution to optimizing vaccination programs for animals, nonetheless, a solid understanding of the animal's innate and environmental risk factors as well as the variables such as stress will enable the development of tailored vaccination schedules that best meets the needs of the animal. The use of vaccines in animal health is not restricted to the protection of morbidity and mortality of the animal hosts themselves, but they are regularly employed as key elements in public health programs. When appropriate biopreparedness, management modeling strategies, and contingency plans of the future are linked with (1) protective DIVA vaccines against zoonoses, (2) effective predictive modeling, and (3) deployable implementation policies, control, and prevention of serious zoonotic diseases of man and animals will become more achievable at local, state, and national levels. modulate the degree of attenuation. This is important to ensure that adequate replication of the attenuated vaccine occurs, to induce optimal levels of protective immunity but not cause any pathology. A final advantage of using live vaccines is that they can be delivered by the natural route of infection to provide protection at the natural site of entry (i.e., mucosal protection). However, even with all these advantages, these approaches are under much greater scrutiny by regulatory agencies than the less safe conventional methodology of attenuation, thereby, adding significantly more expense to the licensing of many potentially valuable vaccines needed by the industry.",

However, it is also possible to introduce temperature-sensitive (TS) mutations which would reduce the pathogens ability to replicate at temperatures present in the lower respiratory tract. Thus, the vaccine could infect the upper respiratory tract and induce immunity, but have limited replication in the lower respiratory tract where damage could lead to complications such as pneumonia and possibly death. In addition to introducing this single TS mutation, one could introduce multiple TS mutations, thereby providing a much safer and stable attenuation than is currently possible with conventional TS mutants. This approach is very attractive for many respiratory infections, but especially for influenza viruses where TS mutants are currently in use for control of equine influenza ( Townsend et al., 2001 ) .",

However, it is also possible to make vaccines by deleting essential genes, which will completely prevent the replication of the vaccine in vivo. This type of mutation results in replication defective organisms, making the vaccine totally safe. Such an approach has been used for a variety of different prototype vaccines. The principle behind this approach is that it is possible to culture the vaccine in vitro by supplying the elements required for replication. Once the agent is introduced in vivo, where the element is absent, the agent undergoes an abortive infection. However, during this abortive infection, sufficient antigens are produced to induce immunity. These types of defective vaccines can be produced against a number of different organisms. A variation on the replication defective vaccines approach is one where a specific gene is introduced requiring a specific metabolite or compound to replicate ( Donnenberg and Kaper, 1991 ) . This allows controlled replication in vitro as well as in vivo as long as the required compounds are introduced with the vaccine or individuals are fed the specific compound for a period of time to allow the vaccine to replicate in vivo. On removal of the required compound, the agent dies. These types of approaches are easy to introduce into bacteria for making bacterial vaccines. These types of vaccines should remove the concern about shedding of organisms in environments as they would rapidly die in the environment because of lack of complementary growth components.",

Thus, it is possible to immunize an individual against not only the organism that has been attenuated, but also against antigens which are being carried by the vector. Thus, a single immunization can protect individuals from a variety of diseases. This approach is gaining considerable interest from the veterinary biopharmaceutical industry since it would make vaccine production and delivery much more economical with a single vector carrying multiple vaccines manufactured in a single step. Furthermore, there should be no interference between the antigens as is often seen with multiple agents at the time of vaccination. Currently, over a dozen viral vaccines based on a pox virus vector are licensed in veterinary medicine ( Gerdts et al., 2006 ) . Similarly, a number of companies are developing adenovirus-based vectors ( Reddy et al., 1999a ( Reddy et al., , 1999b . In the case of poxvirus-based vectors, one can either use mammalian or avian poxviruses as vectors. Since avian poxviruses undergo abortive replication in mammalian cells, they are gaining significant market share where they have been licensed. Thus, the safety concerns outweigh any genetic engineering concerns. The most recent report of developing solid immunity of monkeys to Ebola/ Marburg and lassa virus following a single immunization with a VSV recombinant has created significant excitement using VSV as a potential vector ( Jones et al., 2005 ) . However, in all these instances of vectored vaccines, one is always concerned about the impact of preexisting immunity to the vector on the potential efficacy of the vaccine. The possible reason that the monkeys were totally protected from Ebola following VSV-vectored immunization versus adenovirusvectored immunization is the fact that the monkeys were na \u00ef ve to VSV.",

Instead of developing vaccines containing all the antigens of the pathogen, it is possible to identify the few critical proteins that are involved in inducing protection and use them as a vaccine. Theoretically, it is possible to purify the proteins from any conventionally produced vaccine. However, this is very expensive, therefore, it is much more economical to clone the gene and produce it as a subunit vaccine using biotechnology approaches. Before embarking on a subunit vaccine program, it is critical to identify the critical antigens for incorporation into a vaccine and then produce these antigens in a commercial setting. Fortunately, our knowledge regarding the critical proteins and ability to isolate the genes coding for these proteins has become relatively routine in the last decade. Thus, the protective antigens for most important infectious disease agents in veterinary medicine are now known. For those agents where we still need to identify the putative protective antigen, we can use comparative biology and genomics to identify them relatively quickly. However, identification is only the first step in a vaccine production program. Once the antigen is identified, it must be produced in a commercially viable system.",

In addition, these vectors can be used to induce immunity in ovo ( Rautenschlein et al., 1999 ) . Currently, in ovo vaccination has gained significant popularity due to the ease of handling and providing immunity very early in life of poultry. In addition to carrying genes from other pathogens, these vectors can also carry immunomodulatory genes to act as adjuvants to enhance the efficacy of the vaccine ( Raggo et al., 1996 ; Giavedoni et al., 1997 ) . Although these vectored vaccines have many advantages, consideration must be given to the antigen being delivered. For example, one would not choose a viral vector when immune responses to carbohydrate or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigens are needed. In contrast, a bacterial vector would be ideal for such a vaccine. Similarly, one would not choose a bacterial vector to deliver a viral protein whose confirmation is very sensitive to posttranslational modification.

Unfortunately, many inactivating agents do have an impact on immunogenicity by damaging or altering specific proteins, therefore, it is important to achieve a balance between full inactivation and reduction of immunogenicity ( Ferguson et al., 1993 ) . Unfortunately, with some infectious agents, especially those that may aggregate, it is not possible to have inactivating agents penetrate the aggregate and, as a result, some outbreaks of disease have occurred due to improper inactivation ( Brown, 1993 ) . Thus, there continues to be a search for new inactivating agents. For all inactivated vaccines it is critical that the protective antigens are present at the concentration sufficient to induce an immune response. In bacteria, many virulence factors may be extracellular secreted proteins, therefore, they are not present in sufficient quantities in whole inactivated organisms to induce protective immunity. Possibly, the best examples are the RTX toxins in the Mannheimia , Actinobacillus , and Pasteurellae species ( Shewen and Wilkie, 1982 ) . These antigens are critical for effective vaccination, but are secreted and, therefore, are not present in whole, killed inactivated vaccines. To overcome this problem, companies have \" spiked \" the whole killed inactivated vaccines with culture systems to ensure their immunogenicity. Although these are often more expensive and difficult to scale-up, they are required especially for viral glycoproteins. Since viral glycoproteins are generally anchored in cell membranes, this requires destruction of cells to purify the glycoprotein. To overcome this impediment, it is possible to remove the transmembrane anchor and allow secretion of the protein ( Kowalski et al., 1993 ) . This not only increases the yield, but also reduces the purification cost, thereby making the vaccines affordable for livestock application. Significant advances in production of subunit vaccines are being made by expressing antigens in plants, which confer most of the posttranslational events present in mammalian cells. Further advantages are that it is possible to target the vaccine antigen to oil bodies in the plant ( van Rooijen and Moloney, 1995 ) . This makes the vaccine very thermostable, allowing ease of purification and, more importantly, the vaccine is already incorporated in the metabolizable oil adjuvant. Although there are currently no licensed vaccines produced in plants, it is envisaged that this will occur shortly as a number of companies are currently testing a number of such vaccines.",

The concept of DNA vaccination is extremely simple in that a plasmid expressing a gene encoding the antigen of interest is injected into an animal, which then expresses the protein (vaccine) of interest. Thus, the animal acts as the bioreactor to produce the vaccine and, consequently, the animal is immunized. This simple process does not require any downstream protein purification, although it does require plasmid purification and abolishes the need for adjuvants. Another advantage, depending on the route of administration, is that these vaccines generally induce both humoral and cellular immunity. This is primarily because the antigen is produced endogenously and all posttranslational modifications are similar to those seen following regular viral infections. Furthermore, improvements in both enhancing immunity as well as driving the cell-mediated arm of the immune system has been achieved by coadministration of these DNA-based vaccines with plasmids encoding IL-12 and IL-15 ( Hanlon et al., 2001 ) .",

Thus, few plasmids actually get into the nucleus and express antigen. To overcome this problem various methods have been used to increase transfection including: (1) electroporation, (2) formulation in different polymers or lipid-based vesicles, and (3) mechanical delivery using air or gene guns (reviewed by van Drunen Littel-van den Hurk et al. (2004) ) . Second, in the case of RNA viruses or bacterial genes, it is often necessary to introduce introns and remove cryptic splice sites to ensure expression occurs even after entry of the plasmid into the nucleus. Altering codon bias has also proven in some cases to enhance expression. The effects made to enhance the efficacy of DNA vaccines in livestock have been reviewed on a number of occasions . Possibly the most efficient method of delivery of genetic vaccines is the use of alphavirus replicons ( Schultz-Cherry et al., 2000 ) . Since alphaviruses naturally target cells for infection, they are ideal delivery vehicles. Using the alphavirus replicons system, the envelope can be engineered in such a way that it more efficiently targets the antigen-presenting cells (dendritic cells) for active targeting of vaccines. Since the replicons are not able to reproduce they are deemed to be safe.",

Due to the reliance on serological confirmation, most countries banned vaccination against exotic diseases. Possibly, the best example of such an approach is with foot-and-mouth disease. The introduction of footand-mouth diseases into countries that are normally free of this disease results in quarantine and slaughter to eradicate disease rather than to conduct ring vaccination. Since ring vaccination would result in serological positive animals the country would continue to be considered \" infected \" as long as there were serologically positive animals in the country. However, the application of a serological test to differentiate between vaccinated and infected animals has a potential to change this practice. As countries move to eradication of endemic diseases or controlling novel introduced diseases through vaccination programs industry or the global community. Thus, some of these vaccines and their acceptance will not only be driven by economics to the individual producer, but it is also often politically motivated by trade interests and macroeconomic issues. Thus, once a country is declared disease-free that country can use its disease-free status as an effective trade barrier to keep out livestock from countries that are not disease-free. As more confidence is developed in DIVA vaccines and the diagnostic tests are simpler to perform, it is hoped that the entire globe would embrace these types of vaccines and reduce the accidental introduction of exotic diseases into countries or if introduced, will reduce the number of animals that are needlessly slaughtered to return the country to disease-free status.",

This is important because how it is formulated and delivered will dramatically influence the quality as well as the magnitude of the immune response generated. For example, a parenterally administered nonreplicating vaccine will induce only a systemic immune response, but have very little ability to induce mucosal immunity. Currently, there is extensive evidence to suggest that delivering the vaccine to mucosal sites is the most effective way to induce mucosal immunity. Another advantage of mucosal delivery is that the animal also develops systemic immunity, in addition to mucosal immunity. In addition to broadening the immune response, mucosal immunity has other advantages such as avoiding the pain and injection site reactions, and broken needles, etc. associated with parenteral injection. This route of administration can also be less expensive, but depending on management systems, may be more difficult to perform. For example, wild range cattle are not very receptive to intranasal delivery of vaccines; therefore, oral delivery may be more attractive in these circumstances. Unfortunately, despite many experimental reports few oral vaccines are licensed for livestock. The reason for this is the lack of effective delivery systems that target the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). The difficulty of delivering vaccines to the GALT is a result of a combination of many factors including degradation of the antigen and various physiological barriers. For example, in the ruminant, traversing the rumen to the intestine where the GALT is provides a major challenge. However, despite these challenges a number of promising developments are being pursued.",

Since the vaccine lacks a specific protein, a companion diagnostic test is developed which can serologically differentiate infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA).

This vaccine, was the result of a natural deletion of the glycoprotein (gE) gene from the virus ( van Oirschot et al., 1986 ) . This vaccine was used for decades to control pseudorabies virus in pigs and was known as the Barta strain. Coincidentally, it also has a gE deletion, which then could be used as a marker for differentiating vaccinated animals from latent carriers of the disease. As a result of the first DIVA vaccine, many areas are now free of pseudorabies virus. Although the pseudorabies virus was a naturally occurring virus, the availability of recombinant DNA technology, combined with our knowledge of gene sequences, and the ability to identify nonessential genes in many pathogens and delete them provides us with a great opportunity to develop DIVA vaccines for almost any infectious disease. As a result of these initial successes, several marker vaccines are already commercially available and their role and contribution to disease eradication appears promising. However, for DIVA vaccines to be embraced by the industry there will need for support by various levels of governments including the livestock industry to ensure that the biopharmacy industry develops these vaccines. For example, there are opportunities to develop DIVA vaccines for footand-mouth disease, but the international community does not yet appear to be willing to embrace vaccination against foot-and-mouth disease in countries which are normally foot-and-mouth disease free ( Clavijo et al., 2004 ) . In the case of foot-and-mouth disease, a DIVA test is available based on the detection of antibodies to NSPs that is the preferred diagnostic method to distinguish viral infected carrier animals from vaccinated animals, but is not yet embraced by the international trade community. Thus, even though the better technology is available, this will not guarantee that the technology will be embraced by the Since many viruses and bacteria can survive the gastrointestinal tract they are being used as vectors for vaccine development for providing oral or mucosal delivery. Possibly, the best example of such a vaccine is the vaccinia-vectored rabies vaccine. In this case, the rabies glycoprotein is inserted into a vaccinia virus which is then incorporated into bait for the control of rabies virus in wildlife ( Brochier et al., 1991 ( Brochier et al., , 1995 . The advantage of such an approach is that if one chooses a thermostable vector, the vaccine remains viable in the environment for significant lengths of time. Second, one does not need to trap the individual animals since they routinely encounter the bait during their normal activities, as they eat the bait they get vaccinated ( Brochier et al., 1995 ) . Similarly enteric bacteria such as Salmonella can also be used as vectors for carrying a variety of vaccine antigens. Although the safety issues prior to release of these vectors into the environment are very thoroughly investigated there is always a concern, possibly unwarranted, about the potential consequences of release of recombinant agents into the environment. To overcome this concern, interest is developing in oral delivery systems for nonliving antigens. This is possible by encapsulating the antigen in novel polymeric microparticles. These particles can be produced from a range of polymers, which protect the antigen from degradation in the gastrointestinal or respiratory tract and target these vaccines to the tonsilar crypt cells or Peyer's patches of the gastrointestinal or respiratory tract, respectively.",

            "text": "For microparticles to be effective, they must be engulfed by the M cells of the Peyer's patches. Significant work has focused on investigating the optimal size of particles for effective uptake. Uptake can also be modulated by changing the charge, hydrophobicity and linking of specific ligands to the particles to target the vaccine to M cells. For example, the size of polylactide-coglycolide (PLG) microparticles has been studied extensively with regards to their uptake and transport to lymph nodes. If one could generalize, which is risky, particles of \u03fd 10 \u03bc m are taken up easier by the Peyer's patches than particles \u03fe 10 \u03bc m. This is the case with both PLG and alginate particles ( Eldridge et al., 1993 ; Kim et al., 2002 ) . The current interest in producing nanoparticles for various drug-delivery systems is also being exploited for vaccine delivery and has shown that smaller particles are better than large particles for uptake. Thus, it is clear that size is very important for the efficient uptake of microparticles carrying vaccine antigens. Furthermore, since the mucosa has a negative charge, positive-charged particles are more effective in uptake than negative-charged particles. Another approach for enhancing uptake of microparticles is to link various lectins to the microparticles which then can specifically target M cells ( Pappo et al., 1991 ; Mantis et al., 2002 ) . In addition to being able to directly target microparticles to the oral mucosa, interest is also increasing in being able to use these microparticles to develop single dose vaccines, whereby microparticles of different composition are employed with some particles releasing antigen immediately upon uptake and others releasing antigen at 1 -2 weeks after uptake ( Cleland et al., 1998 ; Tamber et al., 2005 ) . This approach is especially attractive since it would provide a priming of the immune system upon vaccination and a booster later on. This has recently been demonstrated with an HIV vaccine in baboons ( Cleland et al., 1998 ) . To further enhance the efficacy of microparticles as delivery vehicles it is possible to incorporate adjuvants with the antigen in the microparticles and not only deliver the antigen but also provide the immune system with a boost. Incorporation of saponin-derived adjuvants (QS-21) or CpG ODNs into microparticles have been shown to enhance immune responses to the antigens incorporated in the microparticles ( Hunter et al., 2001 ; Diwan et al., 2002 ) . Although PLG microparticles have been the most extensively studied oral delivery microparticle systems, numerous other microparticles have also been investigated. These include polycapralactone (PEC), starch-based microparticles, alginate microparticles, and most recently polyphosphazenes ( Payne et al., 1995 ; Benoit et al., 1999 ; McNeal et al., 1999 ; Wikingsson and Sjoholm, 2002 ; Rydell and Sjoholm, 2004 ) . The reason for investigating other formulations is that the generation of PLG microparticles generally requires organic solvents and upon degradation in the intracellular environment generates an acidic environment. In some cases this is very detrimental to preservation of different epitopes. This is possibly the reason that incorporation of Brucella ovis in PEC microparticles was much more effective in protecting animals from challenge with live B. ovis versus encapsulation of the same antigen in PLG which did not confer protection ( Murillo et al., 2001 ) . It is also interesting to note that the quality of the immune response induced by the PEC microparticles was associated with a Th1-like response, whereas those induced by PLG encapsulated antigen was associated with a Th2-like immune response.",

It is for this reason that most injections are now given subcutaneously in the neck where meat cuts are of less quality. In the case of cats, aluminum adjuvants have been implicated in fibrosarcomas ( Burton and Mason, 1997 ) and, therefore, the trend is to move to nonadjuvanted vaccines for cats. The major problem with most adjuvants is they generally induce a strong Th2-like immune response, but very little Th1-like immune responses. Because of these concerns, the quest continues for novel adjuvants that do not cause any adverse reactions, but still induce the desired response.",

These oil emulsions vary from mineral to plant oils and can be oil in water or water in oil emulsions. The major problem with mineral oils is that they are nonmetabolizable, leading to residues and injection site reactions. To overcome these problems, metabolizable oils are replacing mineral oils. Many of these metabolizable oils are plant-based. In addition to using plant-derived oils, other plant components with immunomodulatory properties are also used, either in combination with oils or alone ( Kensil et al., 1991 ; Wu et al., 1992 ) . Possibly the best known plant-derived adjuvant is saponin (Quil A) or various fractions of Quil A, best known as QS21. One of the mechanisms of action of QS21 is its ability to stimulate cytokines, which help create the environment required to drive the immune response. To further enhance the activity producing alginate microparticles, it is also possible to encapsulate live microorganisms, thereby protecting them as they transit the stomach to the gastrointestinal tract. This was clearly demonstrated by the ability to encapsulate bovine adenovirus in alginate microspheres and develop immune responses following oral administration of the virus ( Mittal et al., 2000 ) .",

Furthermore, it is possible to formulate polyphosphazenes into microparticles with no organic solvents. Thus, the procedure is extremely mild and one captures the benefit of microencapsulation as well as adjuvanticity all in one type of particle. Although these polyphosphazene microparticles have proven to be very effective in preliminary studies in mice, they require further investigation for application to livestock and companion animals. Although we have identified the areas of current interest and research in microencapsulation and delivery of vaccines in microparticles, it must be emphasized that there are very few studies in large animals demonstrating the application of microparticle formulated antigens for oral immunization. Clearly, much more work is required in large animals but the knowledge that is gained regarding the needs to stimulate the GALT, the size of microparticles, and charges to enhance immune responses combined with preliminary studies in a number of veterinary species demonstrating their potential utility is encouraging and needs to continue to be pursued.",

The current adjuvants can be classified into: (1) mineral salts, (2) synthetic adjuvants, (3) oil emulsions, (4) plant products, (5) lipid-based vehicles, (6) bacterial products, and, finally (7) molecular adjuvants or cytokines or any combination of the above ( Cox and Coulter, 1997 ) . In humans, only aluminum salts or MF-59 are licensed, whereas in veterinary medicine many different adjuvants are in current use. Unfortunately, the exact mechanism by which most adjuvants work is not fully understood and different adjuvants probably have different mechanisms of action. These range from creating a depot of the antigen to attract antigen-presenting cells to the site of vaccination to creating a cytokine environment at the vaccination site to help expand the immune reactive cells. Regardless of the mechanism of of QS21, it is possible to combine them with other lipid components to form ISCOMs or cage-like structures containing the antigen of interest ( Cox et al., 1998 ; Morein et al., 2004 ) . Thus, ISCOMs act both as delivery vehicles and enhance immunity to the antigen incorporated into the ISCOMs. Currently, most ISCOM-based vaccines incorporate viral glycoproteins into the ISCOM. These vaccines can be delivered either parenterally or mucosally, and can induce both antibody and cellular responses ( Takahashi et al., 1990 ; Morein et al., 2004 ) . One of the disadvantages of ISCOMs is the poor loading capacity and the difficulty of incorporating nonmembranous antigens into ISCOMs ( Reid, 1992 ) . Similar to ISCOMs, liposomes have been used experimentally with excellent results. In addition to use with subunit vaccines, lipid-based delivery systems are also efficient in delivery of DNA-based vaccines ( Zelphati and Szoka, 1996 ) .",

These cells are typically bypassed with a needle injection. Targeting dendritic cells has the potential to reduce antigen quantity, reduce or eliminate the need for adjuvants, and significantly reduce the volume of injection.

More importantly E. coli , for the purpose of this discussion are characterized by their virulence factors. Attachment: E. coli O157 is part of a group of strains called enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC). Their attachment to the enterocyte causes a lesion that is characterized as effacing because they destroy the cytoskeleton (attaching/effacing E. coli ). The molecular mechanism has been well described and necessitates at least four major proteins: Esp A, Esp B, Tir, and Intimin. Intimin (a bacterial outer membrane protein) and its receptor aspect of campylobacter colonization is that campylobacter is not usually detected in chickens less than 2 -3 weeks of age under commercial broiler production conditions ( Jacobs-Reitsma et al., 1995 ; Evans and Sayers, 2000 ) . However, experimentally it has been shown that chickens less than 2 -3 weeks of age are susceptible to campylobacter infection resulting in colonization of the gut suggesting that there is no genetic factors of age-related resistance to infection ( Hald et al., 2001 ; Shane and Stern, 2003 ) . The observed agerelated resistance to colonization by campylobacter has recently been attributed to presence of high levels of maternal antibodies ( Sahin et al., 2003 ) in which the decline of maternal antibodies associated with an increase in colonization rate. In addition, maternal antibodies were shown to opsonize campylobacter in in vitro experiments. However, it is well documented that chickens with maternal antibodies can be infected and colonized with campylobacter if higher doses of challenge inoculums ' were used ( Noor et al., 1995 ; Hald et al., 2001 ) .",

This is a particularly difficult target as it must reach a colonization site on the mucosal surface and eliminate or prevent colonization by bacteria that have developed exquisite solutions to parasitize this ecological niche. The most advanced approach is based on the use of E. coli secreted antigens that contain several of the proteins involved in the attachment (e.g., Esps and Tir). This approach uses traditional technology but is built on the very precise understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms. It is administered three times by the subcutaneous route. It has led to significant decreases in shedding levels both in challenge models and field trials .

The clinical outcome of the disease varies greatly from species to species and is also dependent on virulence factors on the parasite and the host immune response to them. In immunocompetent humans, the infection can be asymptomatic even though the parasite replicates and is excreted. When an illness develops the outcome ranges from mild enteric symptoms without diarrhea to a profuse watery diarrhea. Additional symptoms can include abdominal cramps, vomiting, low-grade fever, fatigue, anorexia ( Ungar, 1990 ; Mac Kenzie et al., 1994 ) . The disease is self limiting and typically resolves within 2 weeks. Organisms usually infect the lower small intestine, but in immunosuppressed patients, it can extend from the esophagus, throughout the intestinal tract to the rectum. In some cases the appendix, gall bladder, bile ducts, pancreas, and occasionally even the respiratory tract have been infected ( Ungar, 1990 ) . In humans, the most frequently found organism, designated Cryptosporidium parvum genotype 1 (or human genotype), appears host-specific, infecting, and spreading only among humans. This organism is now recognized as a separate species, Cryptosporidium hominis ( Morgan-Ryan et al., 2002 ) . Another organism, designated C. parvum genotype 2 (or cattle genotype), is zoonotic, capable of infecting and spreading among many mammalian hosts. The main reservoir of C. parvum genotype 2 is cattle. Virtually all cattle are exposed to the parasite during the first few months of life. Calves will shed large number of oocysts (up to 10 9 /g of feces) for approximately 10 days. An active immune response will develop and control the infection. However, evidence suggests that most infected animals will carry C. parvum for life, shedding few oocysts intermittently. Collectively, data suggest that vast numbers of oocysts are passed into the environment and that cattle contribute significantly to these large numbers.

The disease has a very significant impact on the economic performances of the herd. The agent S. suis is a gram-positive cocci and part of the broad genus Streptococcus . A very important feature of the organism is its significant diversity. At the serotype level, 35 different capsular types have been described. Serotype 2 is the most common isolate but its frequency varies significantly from country to country and between North America and Europe. Serotype 1/2 is the next most frequent isolate ( Martinez et al., 2002 ) . At the genetic level, significant diversity is observed between herds and even within herds. Interestingly, the pathogenic strains emerging within a herd seem to separate more distinctly from the isolates obtained in healthy swine ( Berthelot-Herault et al., 2005 ) . At the molecular level, differences are also observed in expression of putative virulence factors ( Smith et al., 1996 ) .",

Neither has met with significant success. The majority of the market remains occupied by autogenous bacterins. Autogenous bacterins could provide a means to avoid the significant antigenic variation of the strain by providing a vaccine derived from the particular strain infecting the herd.

Despite the fact that more than 200 drugs have been tested for activity against C. parvum , in vitro or in vivo, there is still no effective treatment ( Rehg, 1993 ; Fayer and Fetterer, 1995 ; Woods et al., 1996 ; Armson et al., 1999 ) . A cattle vaccine against C. parvum might reduce the environmental contamination and consequently the frequency of waterborne cryptosporidiosis outbreaks in humans. Since cattle may be exposed to C. parvum from their day of birth, before their immune system is mature, an active vaccination is not likely to mediate any significant protection. Thus, vaccination against C. parvum is being attempted for the purpose of generating hyperimmune colostrum-containing antibodies that may be effective in passive immunotherapy against cryptosporidiosis in calves. Calves fed hyperimmune colostrums, prepared against oocysts, and challenged had significantly reduced patent periods, oocyst shedding and days of diarrhea compared to calves fed normal colostrums ( Fayer and Fetterer, 1995 ) . A number of recombinant C. parvum surface or internal antigens have been expressed by DNA-cloning technology. Immune colostrum specific for several recombinant C. parvum proteins have demonstrated efficacy in murine and ruminant models against cryptosporidiosis. The most promising candidate proteins for vaccine development are surface (CP15/60, CP15, and P23) and micronemal proteins (TRAP-C1, GP900) of sporozoites. Both CP15/60 and P23 are detected by Western blot analyses of cryptosporidium proteins using fecal antibodies and serum from cryptosporidium-infected humans and animals ( Lumb et al., 1988 ; Mead et al., 1988 ; Hill et al., 1990 ; Reperant et al., 1994 ) . CP15/60 is defined by the monoclonal antibody (MAb) 5C3. CP15/60 IgA MAb provided protection against infection when administered orally to suckling mice ( Tilley et al., 1991 ) . The comparison of two recombinant forms of CP15/60, one produced in a prokaryotic expression system and the other in a eukaryotic expression system, indicated that the most potent immune response was obtained using the eukaryotic form, possibly due to posttranslational modifications ( Sagodira et al., 1999 ) . It has been reported that preparturient cows immunized with DNA encoding CP15/60 in the mammary gland produced sporozoite-specific antibodies in the colostrums ( Jenkins et al., 1999 ) . Immune colostrum induced a 50% reduction against C. parvum development in mice.",

The perception that vaccines provide sterilizing immunity, where the disease agent does not establish an infection, while widely held, is generally unfounded and largely unrealistic. It is debatable if such immunity is even in the animal's best interest as exposure to, and transient infection with, pathogens helps keep the immune response active. Vaccines usually provide protection on one of three levels. First, at the lowest level, protection is simply a reduction of clinical signs associated with the infection. The reduction may be decreased disease severity and/or duration, or simply a delay in the onset of the disease. The infection still becomes established and in most cases the animal will be contagious to other in-contact animals, although there may be a reduction in the level of shedding of the infectious agent. Such immunity is not usually capable of stopping an outbreak from progressing. Second, vaccines may induce immunity that can prevent clinical signs associated with the infection, where the animal shows no overt signs of being infected. This level of protection may actually be associated with a reduction of shedding of the challenge organism, which can reduce spread during a disease outbreak. Unfortunately, there is no general rule to rely upon in this regard, as reduction in shedding tends to be specific for the strains involved -both of the vaccine and the infection. It must be recognized that vaccine protection that prevents clinical signs of disease being identified can lead to a false assumption that the prevalence of diseases has resulted in the adoption of tailored vaccination programs. Such programs generally are designed to consider the risks (e.g., disease prevalence and exposure likelihood), husbandry (e.g., animal-to-animal contact, nutrition), and environmental factors (e.g., wildlife vectors, weather) and of course the animals (e.g., age, previous disease experience).",

The physical part is easy to see -fetal membranes and fluids shield the fetus behind a muscular uterine wall inside a multilayered abdomen.

Vaccination of the mother is commonly practiced to accomplish both. In species where litters are common, for example, pigs, vaccination of the dam is an effective way to protect the entire litter with a single vaccine dose. Even in single offspring dams, for example, cattle, vaccination is recognized as providing added insurance to getting a healthy newborn. It can also be an effective way for neonatal animals to gain early immunity against the plethora of infectious challenges they face in the first weeks of life. There is evidence that active vaccination of the fetus may occur with some antigens crossing the placenta and stimulating fetal immunity. Sows, with a gestation period of 113 days, are often vaccinated near the time of breeding and again 2 weeks prior to farrowing. Such vaccinations have proven effective in increasing litter size and growth performance ( Descamps et al., 1990 ) . The vaccination in early pregnancy is aimed at protecting the litter by stimulating active immunity in the sow against common pathogens that cause abortion, metritis, or stillbirths, for example, Leptospira spp., parvovirus, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae . These vaccines, typically given by injection, induce an active immune response in the sow, preventing the viremia or bacteremia from occurring and thus protecting the unborn piglets. Vaccinations in late pregnancy are aimed at boosting immunity to maximize the level of passive immunity (transplacental and colostral antibodies) that a dam passes on to her offspring. Typically these vaccinations are targeted at neonatal diseases causing enteric (e.g., rotavirus, E. coli ) or respiratory problems (e.g., Pasteurella multocida , Bordetella bronchiseptica ). Piglets born of vaccinated sows generally have performed significantly better than those of nonvaccinated sows when evaluated on a variety of parameters such as growth and average daily weight gain ( Riising et al., 2002 ) .",

Colostrum is the first milk that is produced by mammals for their babies.

Research has shown that maternal antibodies may be concentrated in the colostrum to levels higher than that found in the dam's circulation ( Pfeffer et al., 2005 ) . Through the use of dam vaccination, the specificity and level of these antibodies can be manipulated to tailor protection that is most appropriate for the geographical region or environment where the birth occurs. Maternal antibodies can be directly absorbed by the newborn and enter into circulation providing passive immunity against otherwise fatal infections. There is now good evidence that cells and cytokines of the dam's immune system also pass via colostrum to the newborn. These components of colostrum significantly aid the development of the neonatal immune result of the transient febrile reaction decreasing implantation of the embryo. Vaccination in late pregnancy, close to parturition, tends to be less effective. Around the time of parturition, there is a well-described phenomenon of reduced immune system activity ( Houdijk et al., 2000 ) .

It is during these early weeks of life after birth that newborn animals are the most vulnerable and this is where vaccines can be most beneficially used. The husbandry practices that we use with many of our animals species often entails mixing of animals from a variety of sources, for example, the combining of 3 week old pigs from perhaps hundreds of litters when they move to the nursery, or mixing of hundreds of puppies at 6 weeks of age when they are transported to the pet shop.

As most animal breeders expect to make money from selling the offspring, each individual animal has a monetary value. This enables a fairly objective view to be taken of risk benefit analysis -the benefits arising from the use of vaccines versus the cost of disease. Most animal breeders have tailored vaccination programs to the needs of their animals, with multiple injections of different vaccines being common. Typically neonatal animals receive multiple vaccinations covering the major diseases that their owners expect they may become exposed to during their lives. A kitten could receive eight different vaccines on two or three separate occasions, although many are given in combination -feline herpesvirus, feline calicivirus, feline panleukopenia, feline leukemia virus, rabies virus, and Chlamydia are common; with feline immunodeficiency virus, B. bronchiseptica and Toxoplasma gondii also available for cats. Puppy vaccinations often involve combinations containing protection against 11 different disease agents, for example, canine parvovirus, distemper, canine adenovirus types 1 and 2, canine parainfluenza, rabies virus, four different Leptospira species and B. bronchiseptica .

Several options exist with aerosol spray and drinking water being the most common. The vaccines typically are live agents that are diluted in water containing a stabilizer to prolong the in-use viability of the agent. Aerosol vaccination can be tailored to the particular vaccine by adjusting the droplet size that in turn alters the location within the respiratory tract where the droplet eventually lodges ( Gough and Allan, 1973 ; Gomez and Correa, 1978 ) . While originally developed for poultry vaccination, aerosol vaccination has been used in swine ( Nielsen et al., 1990 ) and cattle ( Kita et al., 1982 ) with the same factors as for poultry needing to be considered -droplet size, type of diluent, environmental conditions (e.g., wind and temperature) and strain, and dose of the vaccine organism.",

What proves to be worse for the health of the young animal is that these residual antibodies may block effective immunization. associated with poor immune responsiveness and there is little doubt that the newborn goes through many stresses in the first few weeks of life. There, of course, are the routine environmental stressors such as temperature, air quality, etc., but often more critical for animals is the dietary change including weaning at an early age that is routine in most of our domestic species. Pigs, for example, may be weaned at 2 -3 weeks of age, and it has been shown that the composition of their starter diets, in particular the levels of protein, lysine, methionine, and threonine, may be critical in the development of their immune system ( YongQing et al., 2001 ; Nonnecke et al., 2005 ) . The simple event of handling the young animals to enable vaccination has been shown to be stressful and potentially reduces the response to the vaccine. Even a car trip to the veterinarian's office may have the same stressrelated effect on the immune system.

Most vaccines in this category are made from the culture of live organisms that are inactivated, or killed, using one of a variety of chemicals, with formaldehyde the commonest. The inactivated organisms on there own will often only stimulate a weak or transient immune response. While there are numerous causes of this phenomenon, the common explanations are that inactivation alters the conformation and hence presentation of some antigen epitopes and the inactivated antigens do not signal quite the same danger to the animal's immune system. The \" danger signal \" model of immunity moves away from the self versus nonself based view and considers the idea that the immune system is more concerned about organisms that damage the animal rather than just being foreign ( Gallucci and Matzinger, 2001 ) . To overcome this shortcoming, the addition of an adjuvant is classically done to stimulate a greater immune response, or to drive a particular immune response, for example, Th2 versus Th1. Killed vaccines are safe, in that, without live agents in the final product, they cannot be the source of an infection. However, the presence of the adjuvant often results in greater injection site reactions than is seen with live vaccines. Injection site reactions can range from merely discomforting to quite painful, but in livestock they often end up as imperfections in the meat resulting in trim losses on the slaughter line. The route of vaccination is often dictated by the nature of the injection site reaction. In beef cattle most vaccines are given subcutaneously to avoid reactions damaging the meat.

Often these two events will be indistinguishable without an accurate history of the animal. Fortunately when it comes to vaccination it does not matter, both recovery from infection and effective previous vaccination will have engendered an immune memory provided the exposure was not too long ago. The duration of immunity that follows exposure of the immune system to a disease agent, even a vaccine strain, depends on the translation of at least part of the initial response into a memory response. The presence of specific memory T cells enables an amnestic response regardless of the source of the agent inducing the original response. This phenomenon is leveraged in adult vaccination programs to decrease the frequency of revaccination. Traditionally, dog and cats were revaccinated on an annual basis throughout their lifetimes, although it was anticipated that routine vaccines were likely to provide far greater than 1 year of protection. Recent work has proven that under field conditions there is evidence of immunity that can persist for 48 months in some animals ( Mouzin et al., 2004a ( Mouzin et al., , 2004b . Evidence in horses and cattle would indicate that the duration of immunity following vaccination may be only as long as 1 year but varies with the disease agent ( Hannant et al., 1988 ; Peters et al., 2004 ) . The vaccine manufacturer normally provides guidance as to the duration of immunity that may be anticipated following successful vaccination of animals. Depending on the individual circumstances the duration of immunity may be longer or shorter than the label indicates, especially in environments where exposure to the disease agent occurs. This results in natural boosting of immunity and essentially lifelong immunity.",

            "text": "In reviewing data from several sources, Lutticken et al. (2007) found that with the increasing demand for food, the enlarging scale of world food production, the augmented transportation of animals and food products, and simultaneous contact of animals with the environment, several microorganisms have established themselves in farmed animals, which although may be relatively harmless to animals are pathogenic to man. These investigators propose options for reducing the risk of transferring zoonotic agents from animals (particularly farm animals) to man by specifically applying veterinary vaccines against viral and bacterial diseases ( Lutticken et al., 2007 ) . Other investigations documented that avian influenza, West Nile virus, Bartonella henselae , rabies and anthrax vaccines which protect animals reduce or prevent transmission of zoonoses to humans ( Capua, 2007 ; Lutticken et al., 2007 ; Marano et al., 2007 ; Miguens, 2007 ) . Vaccination of vector/ reservoir species, when efficacious vaccines are available, offers will offer significant advantages to combating zoonotic human disease ( Zinsstag and Weiss, 2001 ; Marano et al., 2007 ) . In summary, when appropriate biopreparedness, management strategies and contingency plans of the future ( Westergaard, 2008 ) are linked with (1) protective DIVA vaccines ( Clavijo et al., 2004 ; Selke et al., 2007 ) against zoonoses, (2) effective predictive modeling ( Branscum et al., 2007 ) , and (3) deployable implementation policies ( Kobayashi et al., 2007b ) , control and prevention of serious zoonotic diseases of man and animals will become more achievable at local, state, and national levels .",
