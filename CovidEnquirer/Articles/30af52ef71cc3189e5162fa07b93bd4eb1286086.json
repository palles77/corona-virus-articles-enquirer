            "text": "Almost all commercial poultry are vaccinated against avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) using live attenuated vaccines mass administered by spray at day of hatch. Although many different types of IBV vaccines are used successfully, the ArkDPI serotype vaccine, when applied by spray, does not infect and replicate sufficiently to provide protection against homologous challenge. In this study, we examined a different Ark vaccine strain (Ark99), which is no longer used commercially due to its reactivity in one day old chicks, to determine if it could be further attenuated by passage in embryonated eggs but still provide adequate protection. Further attenuation of the Ark99 vaccine was achieved by passage in embryonated eggs but ArkGA P1, P20, and P40 (designated ArkGA after P1) were still too reactive to be suitable vaccine candidates. However, ArkGA P60 when given by spray had little or no vaccine reaction in one day old broiler chicks, and it induced protection from clinical signs and ciliostasis following homologous challenge. In addition, vaccinated and challenged birds had significantly less challenge virus, an important measure of protection, compared to non-vaccinated and challenged controls. The full-length genomes of viruses from egg passages 1, 20, 40, and 60 were sequenced using the Illumina platform and the data showed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) had accumulated in regions of the genome associated with viral replication, pathogenicity, and cell tropism. ArkGA P60 accumulated the most SNPs in key genes associated with pathogenicity (polyprotein gene 1ab) and cell tropism (spike gene), compared to previous passages, which likely resulted in its more attenuated phenotype. These results indicate that the ArkGA P60 vaccine is safe for spray vaccination of broiler chicks and induces suitable protection against challenge with pathogenic Ark-type virus.",

Because of its prevalence and infectivity, nearly all commercial poultry in the U.S. are vaccinated for IBV in a serotype-specific manner [2, 3] . IBV vaccines are developed by passaging a pathogenic field virus in embryonated eggs until the virus has lost its pathogenicity in chickens. During these repeated rounds of embryo passage, the pathogenic field virus will accumulate mutations that result in an adaptation for replication in embryos. Conversely, the outcome of this adaptation is a decreased affinity for chicken tissues and therefore a reduced virulence in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.08.078 0264-410X/\u00d3 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Ideally, when mass applying an IBV vaccine, a high percentage of chicks should be infected with actively replicating virus (vaccine coverage) by days 7-10 post-vaccination, followed by a gradual decline in viral load. However, it has been shown that the ArkDPI vaccine has an atypical vaccine coverage and replication pattern when mass applied by spray, and previous data from our laboratory suggests that the percentage of chicks infected with vaccine virus by 10 days post-vaccination only reaches 15-25% [11, 12] . Multiple replication cycles also occur in the bird (indicated by viral load and clinical signs in chicks), resulting in ''rolling\" reactions at different time points post-vaccination [13] . Our previous research has shown that to achieve an adequate proportion of infected chicks with ArkDPI vaccine and eliminate rolling replication cycles, a 100x dose is required [12] .",

            "text": "The atypical vaccine coverage and cycling observed following ArkDPI vaccination is a product of the multiple minor genetic subpopulations in the vaccine bottle [14] . It has been previously shown that several serotypes of IBV vaccines contain genetic subpopulations and the subpopulations are often recovered in chickens following vaccination, even though these vaccines show a typical infection and replication cycle and protect from challenge [15] . With ArkDPI, the major population in the vaccine contains multiple, distinct amino acid changes in the spike protein that increase binding affinity in the embryonated egg but decrease binding affinity to mature chicken cells [9, 16] . Conversely, the minor populations, which have the opposite spike protein binding profile, are more suited to infect and replicate in chickens [16, 17] . However, these minor subpopulations are only a fraction of the total genetic population contained in the vaccine bottle. Thus, the proportion of infected chicks is very low and the time to reach peak infection and replication is delayed [12] . For these reasons, chickens do not develop adequate immunity following ArkDPI vaccination. Although using one of the viral subpopulations with binding affinity for chicken cells directly as a vaccine will induce a protective immune response, these subpopulations cannot be maintained through multiple passages in embryonated chicken eggs, which is required to propagate IBV vaccine. Research has been performed to homogenize the ArkDPI viral population by adapting it for growth in chicken embryo kidney cells, however this vaccine model has not yet been shown to be commercially feasible [18] .",

The Arkansas 99 (Ark99) strain was the first Ark-type virus to be attenuated for use as a vaccine. When originally mass applied in the field, it caused a severe vaccine reaction in young broilers, and was therefore discontinued when ArkDPI was developed [19, 20] . The purpose of this study was to reevaluate the original and additionally attenuated Ark99 vaccine by multiple serial passaged in embryonated eggs as a potential Ark-type vaccine candidate. In addition, we investigated the mechanisms of attenuation of this vaccine by sequencing the genome and performing SNP analysis during the subsequent embryo passages. This study led to development of a new, more attenuated yet still efficacious vaccine strain designated Arkansas Georgia (ArkGA).",

The amino acids in virus isolated from swab material showed a reversion to previous vaccine sequences at these positions ( Table 2) .",

            "text": "In this study, serial passage of the ArkGA vaccine virus in embryonated eggs resulted in numerous changes to the viral genome. Over 60 passages, the ArkGA virus accumulated 15 SNPs, 10 of which were located in the replicase and spike genes, which have been attributed to IBV attenuation [31] . Most notably, ArkGA P60 had SNPs in the nsp2, nsp3, and both S1 and S2 gene regions. Changes in nsp2 and nsp3, which are part of the viral replicase complex, have been shown to impact viral replication and pathogenesis [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . In the spike gene, which is the major determinant of cell tropism and plays a role in viral attenuation [39, 40] , 5 amino acid changes occurred in the S1 and S2 subunits. One mutation in S2 resulted in truncation of spike by 8 amino acids, likely shortening the cytoplasmic domain. Changes in the cytoplasmic tail of IBV and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) have been shown to affect endocytosis signaling and regulation of the levels of spike at the surface of infected cells and may reduce infectivity [41, 42] . In severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a truncation of 8 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of S resulted in reductions in cell fusion and cell surface expression and faster endocytosis compared to wild type [43] . As this truncation was only seen in ArkGA P60 and not in previous passages, further investigation is needed to fully understand the ramifications of this truncation. Additionally, a mutation was detected in the nucleocapsid gene, which may be related to reduced replication efficiency [36] .",

During passage of ArkGA, the virus became more attenuated, showing reduced reactivity in vaccinated broiler chickens. Different passages of the ArkGA vaccine were evaluated for infection, replication, vaccine reaction, and efficacy in broiler chicks. Experimental vaccine and challenge trials showed that the ArkGA P1 vaccine had suitable infection and replication, and induced adequate protection from challenge, but was too pathogenic, causing a severe vaccine reaction in the majority of chicks. Further passages in embryonated eggs reduced the severity of the vaccine reaction to 30% for P20, 10% for P40, and 3% for P60. This further attenuation did not adversely affect infection or replication characteristics of the vaccine, as the relative viral load in chicks did not change throughout the trials.",

Experiment 2. Trial 3. ArkGA P60 vaccinated and non-vaccinated clinical signs, ciliostasis scores, and viral loads in chickens post-challenge. Clinical sign scores were calculated based on severity where 0 = negative, 1 = mild signs, 2 = watery eyes and some mucus in the nares, and 3 = watery eyes, mucus in the nares and trachea (tracheal rales). Ct = cycle threshold. Clinical sign scores, ciliostasis scores, and relative viral load were compared between challenge groups using ordinary one-way ANOVA (a = 0.05) with Tukey's multiple comparisons test. The -/-, ArkGA/-, and -/Ark groups each contained 5 chickens. The ArkGA/Ark group contained 20 chickens. pathogenic P1 sequence. In the ArkGA P1 vaccine trial a higher vaccine coverage was seen, indicating that these amino acid positions may have an impact on rate of infection. It is also possible that the changes in the replicase gene and the S2 mutations impacted the performance of ArkGA P60. Infection and replication patterns in all trials were predictable and ''typical\" of what would be expected of an IBV vaccine. This stands in contrast to the infection and replication cycles of the ArkDPI vaccine, which shows very low vaccine coverage and multiple replication cycles during the life of the bird following spray vaccination [13] . One explanation for this is in the S1 portion of the spike gene. The ArkGA P1 spike sequence contains a histidine at position 43, which has been previously shown to significantly increase spike protein binding to chicken tracheal tissues, and an asparagine deletion at position 344, which has been shown to influence the ability of antibodies to recognize the protein. Conversely, the ArkDPI S1 contains a tyrosine at position 43 and an asparagine at position 344, which may be attributed to its reduced ability to bind and replicate in chicken tissues [16] . The presence of a minor virus subpopulation capable of inducing a protective immune response in ArkDPI results in a very low dose of protective vaccine virus when mass vaccinating chickens and consequently poor protection [12] . Although ArkGA was found to have subpopulations, as evidenced by the SNPs observed within each passage, which is quite typical for IBV vaccines [15] , those subpopulations were able to produce a protective immune response when mass applied.",
