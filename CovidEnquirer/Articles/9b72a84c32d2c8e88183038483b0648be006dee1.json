In the evolutionary tug of war between host and pathogen, viruses have developed ways to circumvent or even to take advantage of the host response. It has also become clear that much of the damage and disruption of physiology caused by viral infections is not due to direct cytopathic effects of the virus itself, but to the side effects of misdirected or over-exuberant host immunity.",

Novel methods for tissue preparation allow even entire organs to be made accessible to high resolution confocal imaging in dozens of colors, enabling detailed phenotypic analysis of infiltrating immune cells, the location of virus, and the state of host cells (Gerner et al., 2012) . Emerging tools for DNA and RNA in situ hybridization permits documentation of the transcriptional response to infection. The application of such tools can produce a detailed, four dimensional (volume and time) picture of how a virus spreads, and the nature of the host response. In animals given candidate vaccines or drugs, these tools can also be used to directly visualize the specific effects of the treatment on the infection and the host response, both immune and organ-related.",

Imaging will help us understand cell dynamics, migration, positioning, the cell-cell interactions critical to immune effector responses, and the range over which cytokine and chemoattractants work. These are all facets of immunity that are central to determining what occurs in the face of viral infection and how various cells and factors contribute to maintaining host homeostasis or to disrupting it. Informatic analysis and computational modeling will provide new ways to integrate disparate data sets so that the yin and yang of immune function during an infection can be better understood. More precise understanding of the tipping points where augmentation or blockade could play a key role has the potential to improve health outcomes. Rising virologists will need to become \"physiologists\" with an appreciation for how the entire organism behaves in the face of infection. Such insight will determine the levers that are needed to reduce morbidity and mortality from infection in the absence of fully protective vaccines, and indeed, to determine what components of the immune response are best suited to protection. The future is both exciting and demanding-we will need to do our science in new ways to move forward in the most efficient manner.

One of the first assays of T-cell function, the enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) technique, was revolutionary for its ability to quantitate antigenspecific cytokine production on a single-cell level. This was followed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) by flow cytometry, which was similarly applied to the detection of antigen-specific T cells a few years later. Since then, the growth of multicolor flow cytometry capabilities has led to ICS assays that provide information on multiple cytokines and phenotypic markers in combination.

In addition to the cost and expertise required to set up and maintain the complex instrumentation, the two major drawbacks are acquisition speed and cell recovery. In other words, the CyTOF is slow in collecting cells, and the majority of cells are lost. A secondary drawback is sensitivity, since there is no channel in the mass cytometer that equals the sensitivity of phycoerythrin (PE) or similarly bright fluorochromes in fluorescence flow cytometry. Despite these drawbacks, the wealth of information collected by CyTOF is making it the technique of choice for both broad and deep profiling of immune cells.

Targeted RNAseq uses PCR to amplify a set of genes from cDNA of single cells. The amplified products from each cell are barcoded and pooled for deep sequencing.

Several thousand mutations are transmitted to each sperm, causing coding changes in about 70 genes per haploid genome. These mutations are transmitted to G1 males by breeding the mutagenized sire to a C57BL/6J female. About 40 G1 males are produced each week, and each G1 male is subjected to deep, whole exome sequencing to detect all mutations that cause (or may cause) coding change. Sperms are preserved from this male, which is then used to produce G2 daughters. Ten G2 daughters are then backcrossed to the G1 sire to yield between 30 and 50 G3 progeny. Before the G3 progeny are released for screening, they are genotyped at all mutant sites to determine whether they are homozygous WT (REF), heterozygous (HET), or homozygous variant (VAR). Foreknowledge of genotype assures that when phenotype is measured, an immediate computational determination of linkage can be made, using recessive, semi-dominant, or dominant inheritance models. In general, linkage will be observed only if a phenotype has a genetic basis.

Already widespread is the use of CRISPR/Cas9 technology to modify the genome. It is quite possible to create many targeted mutations within a given model organism genome to probe interactions between pathways that might be thought redundant in function. Yet this innovation too will run its course, and in the future, we may rely upon synthetic genomics. Already it is possible to create designer microbes, with genomes that are modified as the investigator chooses. A complete chromosome of a eukaryotic organism (yeast) has been synthesized as well. Will the day come when we may synthesize the genome of a mouse, modified just as we choose? Very likely yes, and very likely such mice will answer questions that cannot be addressed using the current generation of genome-modifying technologies. Undoubtedly, a cascade of future technical advances will continue to elucidate the interactions between host and pathogen. The first test tube synthesis of a virus (Cello et al., 2002) caused a global uproar. One axiom in biology holds that proliferation of cellular organisms or viruses depends on the presence of a functional genome. The cell-free synthesis of poliovirus has violated this law: no natural template was required to recreate this organism. In 2002, few people were prepared to accept the new reality that viruses exist as infectious particles in nature as well as entries in a database 1 .

Moreover, the price of error-free synthetic oligonucleotides (>100 nucleotides) is still significantly greater than predicted in 2004 (20,000 bp for $1). A revolution, however, is brewing (Notka et al., 2011; Kosuri and Church, 2014) even though the new technologies have not yet reached the commercial sector. It can be predicted that new strategies will drastically change research in molecular genetics and biological engineering: the tedious steps-construction of vectors, of site-specific mutants, etc.will soon be replaced by fast and affordable DNA synthesis. Template-free synthesis of RNA viruses, of course, relies on the chemical synthesis of genome-complementary (double stranded) DNA, referred to as \"cDNA.\" cDNA, in turn, can be enzymatically transcribed into viral RNA and ultimately converted to infectious virus. The chemical synthesis of cDNA discussed here is reminiscent of the enzymatic synthesis of cDNA by retrovirus reverse transcriptase that was introduced by Charles Weissmann and his colleagues in 1978 (Taniguchi et al., 1978) . Weissmann's strategy, termed \"reverse genetics,\" has led to the revolutionary method allowing DNA-based genetic manipulations of RNA viruses. However, whereas the Weissmann strategy requires natural viral isolates to generate cDNA ( Figure  1 (A)), chemical synthesis only needs the genome sequence information readily available on the Internet ( Figure 1 (B)). Assuming the sequence of an RNA is known, we believe that the enzymatic synthesis of cDNAs will soon be replaced by chemical synthesis (Wimmer and Paul, 2011) .",

Moreover, among the terrestrial viruses, RNA viruses outnumber DNA viruses by a ratio of 3:1. Hence, it is not surprising that the chemical synthesis of viruses has so far targeted predominantly RNA viruses ( Table  1 ). The expected revolution in DNA synthesis, and exciting novel strategies for manipulating and assembling large synthetic DNA molecules (Gibson et al., 2010) , will likely result in the chemical syntheses of many more DNA viruses. Table 1 summarizes examples of synthetic viruses in roughly chronological order. The question lingers: what was/ is the purpose of synthesizing viruses independently of their natural isolates? Most importantly, chemical synthesis of viral genomes allows investigation of the structure and function of the organism's biology to an extent hitherto impossible. However, different virus synthesis projects have had different objectives that we will only briefly mention. Wimmer and Paul, 2011 have discussed most of these projects in some detail.",

Nothing better matches this definition than the template-free synthesis of viruses. On the one hand, it advances our understanding of these organisms and leads to new methods to protect us from viral disease; yet, on the other hand it could be exploited with malicious intent. With optimism and enthusiasm, we predict that future applications of synthetic virology will be vastly more constructive than destructive. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and highthroughput DNA sequencing, often referred to as next generation sequencing (NGS), offer exciting new opportunities for the diagnosis and treatment of viral disease. These evolving technologies are leading to a new era of precision (also known as personalized) medicine. This approach is based on the fact that common variants in host genomes may have profound influence on the course of viral infections and the response to treatment. Two examples illustrate the potential of precision medicine: (1) host and viral genome variation in determining response to current standard of care for hepatitis C; and (2) use of NGS as a diagnostic test to identify microbial pathogens.",

Furthermore, patients of African-American and Hispanic descent did not respond as well, and it had not been possible to identify those individuals among all populations who were most likely to respond. GWAS comparing responder and nonresponder populations identified a single nucleotide polymorphism near the interferon responsive gene IL28B that segregates with SVR and explains a significant proportion of the variation in response (Ge, D et al.

Pairing an OV with anti-CTLA4 has already been shown to improve the control of metastatic melanoma beyond that observed with either treatment alone (Zamarin et al., 2014) .

First, prions create a novel mechanism whereby physiological functions can be regulated almost instantaneously, by shifting the conformation of a protein from one structural state to another (Prusiner, 2014) . Second, prions often feature in diseases where a particular protein accumulates inside cells, as found in neurofibrillary tangles, Lewy bodies, glial cytoplasmic inclusions, and nuclear inclusions. In other disorders, prions accumulate outside of cells, like the plaques in Alzheimer's and Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseases. Third, strains of prions with different phenotypes represent distinct conformations of these alternatively folded proteins. Fourth, the late onset of heritable neurodegenerative diseases seems likely to be explained by the conversion of the mutant causative protein into a prion as the precipitating event. Fifth, prion diseases are age dependent; this is likely due to the protein quality control machinery, which slowly becomes less efficient as organisms age.",

Although mutations in patients with familial neurodegenerative diseases have been demonstrated to cause these disorders by genetic linkage studies, explaining the late onset of these illnesses has remained problematic. One explanation is that a stochastic event results in a sufficient number of prions accumulating to initiate a sustainable infection. With aging, an increase in the frequency of random events that produce prions, in tandem with a decline in the protein quality control machinery, conspire to produce sustainable prion infections. This mechanism is applicable to both the inherited and sporadic prion diseases.",

Detailed knowledge of the replication cycle of HIV provided the first targets for antiretroviral drugs (ARVs). The first FDAapproved ARV, the nucleoside analog zidovudine, targeted the reverse transcriptase enzyme, a critical component of the HIV replication cycle that converts viral RNA to proviral DNA, thus allowing integration into the host cell genome. Zidovudine was first synthesized as an antineoplastic agent years prior to the discovery of HIV and was found to have activity against HIV during a screening process. As knowledge of the HIV replication cycle improved, new classes of therapeutic agents were developed. Notably, inhibitors of the HIV protease and integrase enzymes were synthesized and optimized based on detailed crystal structures of the target proteins. Similar investigations have yielded more than 30 licensed ARVs and ARV combinations, all dependent on an intimate knowledge of the viral replication cycle. ARVs have similarly revolutionized HIV prevention, notably through prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programs, which averted 1.4 million infections since 2000 (UN Joint Programme on HIV/ AIDS (UNAIDS), 2015). ARVs have also proved effective when used for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for uninfected individuals, and as \"treatment as prevention\" or TasP when taken by HIV-infected people. Oral PrEP demonstrated more than 90% efficacy in preventing viral acquisition when taken as prescribed (Haberer et al., 2013) . The landmark study HPTN 052 demonstrated the value of TasP, whereby antiretroviral therapy (ART) given to the infected partner in a serodiscordant couple lowers his or her viral load, thus reducing the risk of transmitting the virus to the uninfected sexual partner by 96% (Cohen et al., 2011) . These ARV-based prevention modalities, combined with other interventions such as condoms and voluntary medical male circumcision, provide the building blocks of comprehensive prevention programs.",

In this regard, the development of an effective HIV vaccine is a formidable challenge due to the fact that the natural immune response to HIV is inadequate in controlling and certainly in eliminating the virus. Decades of disappointing clinical trials, first with vaccines aimed at the induction humoral immunity and then cell-based, \"T-cell\" vaccines, failed to produce an effective immune response. The RV-144 trial in Thailand offered the first signs of clinical efficacy, with a 31% reduction in viral acquisition (Rerks-Ngarm et al., 2009) . The RV-144 regimen (canarypox vector prime, recombinant gp120 boost) appears to have elicited non-or weakly neutralizing antibodies against the V1V2 region of the envelope trimer. RV-144 represented the first moderately successful study of an HIV vaccine candidate in humans and reinvigorated the field of HIV vaccinology.",

            "text": "Simultaneously, researchers have deepened their understanding of the immune response to HIV, discovering broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) induced over the course of chronic infection. It is curious that these bNAbs are produced by only a minority of infected individuals (\u223c20%), and usually after 2 or more years of infection (Liao et al., 2013) . Serial blood samples taken from an acutely infected donor revealed the coevolution of viral mutations and a broadening humoral immune response to the virus. At the end of more than 2 years, a hypermutated, broadly reactive anti-HIV antibody evolved together with a highly mutated virus that was continually trying to escape the immune response. Therefore, in trying to evade the evolving antibodies, the virus ultimately stimulates bNAb production, a paradox of HIV immunology. Current research is aimed at determining if these bNAbs can prevent or treat HIV infection. If successful, the major challenge in HIV vaccinology will be to induce these antibodies via appropriate immunogens. Recently, the potential for bNAbs, whether infused directly or produced in vivo by gene inserts administered via viral vectors, to prevent or treat infection has been demonstrated in animal models (Balazs et al., 2014; Shingai et al., 2013; Barouch et al., 2013) . In this regard, vaccinologists are attempting to recapitulate in a more rapid and expeditious manner the natural immune response seen in the minority of infected individuals through prime-boost vaccination regimens. Specifically, they are identifying viral envelope epitopes that induce bNAbs in natural infection, and expressing those as immunogens to induce B-cell maturation toward bNAb-producing cells. Thus, the understanding of the complexities of HIV pathogenesis has offered new hope for a moderately effective HIV vaccine.",

Simply put, a \"cure\" is an indefinite remission of disease following cessation of ART. In HIV, this could come in one of two forms-viral eradication or sustained virologic remission (SVR); for the latter the virus would remain at low levels in the absence of daily ART. The now famous case of the \"Berlin Patient\" offers some evidence that eradication is possible. Still, reliance on hematopoietic stem-cell transplant is unlikely to be feasible and certainly will be risky for the majority of infected individuals. Novel scientific approaches have employed gene-editing techniques to engineer ex vivo mutations into the CCR5 coreceptor for HIV on autologous T cells followed by re-infusion into the donor host, thus rendering them \"resistant\" to HIV infection (Tebas et al., 2014) . These efforts are at an early stage of discovery; however, they merit attention.",

ART was continued through 18 months at which point the child was lost to follow up and stopped treatment. When the child represented to care 5 months later, there were no traces of replication competent virus, a status that persisted for 27 months before the virus ultimately rebounded (Persaud et al., 2013 ; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)). The case indicates that treatment soon after infection can minimize, but not eliminate HIV reservoirs resulting in long-term SVR. Translating this experience into adults could be possible, as evidenced by 14 patients in France treated during acute HIV infection who maintained an SVR after treatment interruption (S\u00e1ez-Ciri\u00f3n et al., 2013) . However, these results need to be confirmed in additional studies.

For example, it is now possible to identify the determinants of antigens that will engage germ-line B cells and promote their differentiation into memory B cells that produce broadly neutralizing antibodies to influenza (Lingwood et al., 2012) . Similarly an understanding of T-cell biology, both maturation and signal transduction following interactions with antigen-presenting dendritic cells, have pointed to rational approaches to immunogen design. This has led to improved adjuvants, and ways to modulate the balance of Th1 or Th2 immunity. Progress in understanding innate immunity, including the TLR signaling, interferon activation and Rig-I stimulation provide tools to selectively activate or suppress these pathways as needed.

In addition, as the molecular epidemiology is further understood, it will become increasingly possible to develop preemptive vaccination strategies, as proposed in the past for avian influenza (Yang et al., 2007) . This will be based on an understanding of viral evolution, human immunity, and predictive patterns of viral mutation.

The increased success of virus-like particles as vaccines is encouraging, because the immunogen closely resembles native virus and elicits effective immunity while the particle is unable to replicate and cause adverse responses. Next-generation improvements, involving the use of synthetic biology and nanotechnology (Kanekiyo et al., 2013) , are expected to create scaffolds and antigen presentation surfaces that will better expose specific epitopes on viral protein. This will make it possible to target responses to subdominant epitopes not normally recognized in the immune response. These advances may permit targeting of highly conserved and vulnerable structures-normally protected by the virus-that can induce broad protective responses immune responses (reviewed in refs (Nabel and Fauci, 2010; Nabel, 2013) ). Finally, as the methodology for expressing engineered molecules improves, it is increasingly possible to modulate immune function through the expression of novel molecules, or through genetic delivery of antibodies (Johnson et al., 2009; Balazs et al., 2011) . Bi-specific antibodies allow for dual targeting against different epitopes on the surface of pathogens (Byrne et al., 2013) . They also provide a mechanism to redirect immune cells that normally do not respond to a specific antigen. The tool of gene delivery can be used to produce selected antibodies in subjects who cannot be induced to make them. For example, this will enhance the induction of neutralizing influenza antibodies in the elderly (Limberis et al., 2013; Balazs et al., 2013) , or by modulating the specificity of T cells to recognize antigenic determinants using chimeric antigen receptors for cancer vaccines (Jensen and Riddell, 2014) . While the T-cell chimeric antigen receptor approach has currently been directed to cancer immunotherapy, it may also prove efficacious against infectious disease targets.",

Powerful technologiessuch as flow cytometry and nanofluidics-now enable detailed qualitative and quantitative interrogation of human immune responses. Similarly, the ability to perform deep sequencing of selected tissues or immune cells provides insight into the ontogeny of the adaptive immune response. At the same time, modern imaging techniques have been applied in vivo and are facilitating an understanding of the trafficking of these cells in response to specific stimuli. This information will lead both to a better understanding of the mechanisms of immune protection as well as to the definition of correlates of immunity against specific pathogens. It will also facilitate the development of new vaccines, or improvements of existing vaccines, which will confer broader reactivity and fewer adverse effects in the large numbers of people who can benefit from them. Finally, it is important to recognize that global surveillance of viral infections, as well as rapid international vaccine distribution, will be greatly assisted by advances in pathogen detection, molecular definition of microbial resistance, and infectious disease surveillance. The ability of electronic and Web-based monitoring will facilitate efforts to distribute vaccines to populations at risk, particularly when unexpected outbreaks occur. The recent epidemic spread of Ebola virus in western Africa highlights the rapidity with which emerging pathogens can spread across international borders. Vaccines represent an essential tool to counter the pandemic spread of infectious diseases and preserve the public health. The welfare of people throughout the world has become increasingly dependent on our ability to provide effective countermeasures against emerging infectious disease threats. In the future, the more effective and efficient development of vaccines, as well as more timely distribution, will increasingly protect the public against these pathogens. In the late 1990s, I attended a retirement symposium for an eminent virologist at which a speaker of the same vintage bemoaned the end of the golden age of virology. In a more recent symposium honoring the life of the late Hilary Koprowski, a nonvirologist speaker asked whether viruses are alive. As you are reading the epilogue of this book, you would have firm evidence to dispute the waning status of virology and to respond \"no\" to the second. You would likely add that although viruses are not living things, they are critical to life. Viral sequences comprise 8% of our genomes and are far from inert. The endogenous retroviral element syncytin, for example, is essential for placental development and embryo survival (Mi et al., 2000) . The field of medical virology is alive and vibrant. New viruses continue to emerge, posing threats to public health, food security, and commerce. Viral databases are rapidly expanding as investigators survey animals and environments using ever more efficient and inexpensive sequencing platforms. With the introduction of new antiviral drugs, therapeutic antibodies and vaccines, viral diagnosis has become more than an arcane academic exercise. Evidence is mounting that viral infections contribute to chronic diseases including neurodevelopmental disorders and some forms of cancer. Viruses have been harnessed in oncology (Miest and Cattaneo, 2014) and gene replacement therapy. On a global scale, there is growing appreciation that viruses contribute to elemental cycling and oceanic carbon sequestration through effects on phytoplankton (Suttle, 2007) . Given the allotted space and the focus of this book on pathogenesis, I can only touch on a few predictions with medical applications but encourage the reader to think more broadly about the implication of viruses and virology.",

We recently estimated that mammals alone harbor more than 300,000 new viruses (Anthony et al., 2013) . At present, we have no way of ascertaining from viral sequence data alone which of them poses substantive threats to humans, wildlife, or domestic animals. However, investments in sequencing, bioinformatics, and systems biology may translate into algorithms that allow us to assess potential for host switching and pathogenicity. At minimum, knowledge of which viruses are circulating and where will enable targeted surveillance in populations at risk for exposure. Surveillance will also become increasingly efficient as diagnostic capacity improves in the developing world. It will be critical to address potential concerns regarding sovereignty and intellectual property if we are to ensure that investigators will be amenable to sharing data and isolates. Public enthusiasm for social media may lead to a global viral equivalent of the American Gut Project wherein citizen scientists share fecal samples and data to develop a human bacteriome database linked to information concerning diet, geography, season, health, and disease (http://humanfoodproject.com/americangut/). A key question that remains to be addressed is whether there are commensal or symbiotic viral flora. Do viruses, like bacteria, have a role in priming or regulating the immune system? Do viruses (primarily bacteriophage) regulate the composition or abundance of bacterial flora? If so, is there an optimum viral microflora and how is it established? Can it be modified? Improvements in diagnostics and insights into the role of viruses in health and disease will provide incentives for the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines. Our armamentarium for herpesviruses, HIV and HCV will expand to include drugs that address not only chronic infections like HPV and HBV that have life threatening sequelae but also acute, self-limited infections (e.g., rhinoviruses) that interfere with activities of daily living and productivity. At present, antiviral discovery typically begins with screening of massive compound libraries. Compounds with activity are then modified and optimized through medicinal chemistry. This brute force approach will ultimately give way to more elegant strategies for rational drug design based in genomics, proteomics, structural biology, and cellular biology. These drugs will target not only the viruses themselves, but also host responses that contribute to viral replication, morbidity, and mortality. Insights into viral biology and evolution and host response will profoundly impact vaccine research. Vaccines will be optimized to expedite the development of protective immune responses, enhance immunity in the very young and the very old, and to increase the duration of protection. Vaccines will target conserved conformational domains to enable immunity to representatives of higher order viral taxa rather than only specific strains. New platforms will be established that facilitate inexpensive, rapid production and atraumatic immunization.",

Perhaps it is our evolutionary history, but we seem more enthusiastic about military spending to keep \"bad guys\" in their place than we are about preparing for an attack by \"bad bugs.\" It is also important that, with all the media hype about \"gainof-function experiments\" we do not impose excessive regulation that discourages talented people from working with exotic viruses.",

Examples are too numerous to cite in this brief account, but influenza viruses, SARS coronavirus, New World arenaviruses, and chikungunya virus provide examples. Minor changes in viral genes encoding ligands for cell receptors may result in a shift in cell tropism and host range from an animal reservoir to humans, or a shift in vector competence, causing increased virus transmission to humans. Elucidating the factors underlying such changes requires collaborative efforts of molecular virologists and cell biologists, as well as experts on the responses to infection of individual organisms and species of vertebrates, insects, and ticks.

The goal of policy analysis is to inform and-in some cases-influence decision makers, including politicians, research administrators, and companies that develop biomedical products. How does policy intersect with viral pathogenesis, particularly research in this field? In this brief commentary I will focus on some examples where controversy has developed at the nexus of research and public health. Salient issues discussed are: dual use research; biosecurity; gain-of-function experiments; and public policies including those regarding \"Select Agents.\"As defined by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, \"Dual Use Research of Concern (DURC) is life sciences research that, based on current understanding, can be reasonably anticipated to provide knowledge, information, products, or technologies that could be directly misapplied to pose a significant threat with broad potential consequences to public health\" (NIH OSP, ND).
