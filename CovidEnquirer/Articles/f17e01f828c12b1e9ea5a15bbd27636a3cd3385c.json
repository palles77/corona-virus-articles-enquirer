            "text": "Virus Research provides a means of rapid publication for original papers on fundamental research concerning virus structure, replication, and pathogenesis. These include reports describing virus morphology, the function and antigenic analysis of virus structural components, virus genome structure and expression, analysis of virus replication processes, effects of viruses on their host cells, including oncogene activation and transduction, neoplastic transformation, and the pathogenesis of virus infections including tumour induction. The journal also publishes review articles on topics of current interest and occasional book reviews and meeting reports. (ISSN 0168-1702 ). For 2012 , volumes 163-170 are scheduled for publication. Subscription prices are available upon request from the Publisher or from the Elsevier Customer Service Department nearest you or from this journal's website (http://www.elsevier.com/locate/virusres).

Abundant amounts of PCV2 antigen-positive cells (brown staining) are associated with the M. hyopneumoniae-induced peribronchial lymphoid hyperplasia (Opriessnig and Halbur from pages 20-32 of this current issue of Virus Research). Upper right panel: Attachment, internalization and uncoating of porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) in target cells. For more detail see article by Nauwynck HJ et al from pages 43-45 of the current issue of Virus Research. Lower left panel: Electron micrograph of porcine circovirus (PCV2) particles after negative staining of infected PK15 cell culture lysates (Allan G et al from 4-9 of this current issue of Virus Research).
