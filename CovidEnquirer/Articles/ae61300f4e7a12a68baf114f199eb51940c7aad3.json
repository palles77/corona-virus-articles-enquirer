According to the epidemic data before Feb.1,2020,it indicated that the probability from the exposed to the infected was 1.7%, 13,14 and the average incubation period was 7 days,and the average hospital stay was 14 days. 15, 16 The average daily contact rate of the infected was 6,referring to the statistical data from CCDC in the early stage of SARS epidemic in 2003. 17,18, 19 However,the population density in Hubei Province was 2.3 times the national average, so the daily contact rate in Hubei was 13.8,and the average daily contact rate of the latent was twice as the infected.The calculation method was R0 = average daily contact rate\u00d7 probability of the exposed to the infected \u00d7infection period.
