Both opportunistic and traditional organisms are important causes of infection. The risk for specific infections varies with timing posttransplant, exposures, and the degree of immunosuppression. Because the array of pathogens is diverse, the risk factors not necessarily modifiable, and the causative exposures not consistently anticipated, prevention of infection is a complicated and imperfect process. Moreover, the clinical presentation of infection may be atypical in the setting of immunosuppression, making diagnosis more difficult. Concurrent coinfections with multiple organisms can occur, and in some cases, it is difficult to differentiate infectious from noninfectious causes of patient presentations. Because transplant recipients are chronically maintained on immunosuppression, they are at especial risk for more severe presentations of infection, even with organisms traditionally associated with more benign courses. Prompt and accurate diagnosis is imperative to ensure optimal outcomes.",

The choice of immunosuppression plays an important role in specific infection risks. For example, T-cell depleting therapies, including antithymocyte globulin, increase the risk for opportunistic infection, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors have been associated with skin and soft tissue infections (Table 40 .1). 2 The risk for infection also reflects a recipient's exposures. This includes pretransplant infections that have the potential for latency (e.g., herpesvirus infections, tuberculosis [TB]) as well as infections associated with the transplant including donor-derived and hospitalacquired infections. In the posttransplant setting, new exposures related to environmental and community interactions need to be considered. In some cases, these exposures can be anticipated based on predictive risk periods posttransplant and appropriate prophylaxis can be administered during the highest risk period to reduce the risk for infection; antivirals directed against cytomegalovirus (CMV) are an example of risk mitigation. A thorough evaluation of all potential recipients and donors is critical to manage infection risks.",

A careful physical examination should be performed. Laboratory testing should include serological testing for herpesviruses (CMV, herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, and Epstein-Barr virus [EBV] ), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), syphilis, and Toxoplasma gondii. In situations where window period infections for HIV, HBV, or HCV may be suspected or if there is concern regarding underlying immunodeficiency that may reduce the sensitivity of serological testing, nucleic acid antibody testing should be obtained. Tuberculin testing is especially important; either interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) or intradermal tuberculin purified protein 4 For patients with a history of birth or prolonged residency in places where there are increased risks for geographically associated infections (e.g., strongyloidiasis, Chagas disease, coccidioidomycosis, and histoplasmosis), additional serological testing for the specific organism should be considered. 3 During the pretransplant evaluation, immunization histories should be reviewed and vaccines updated as appropriate (see immunization section; Table 40 .3).",

            "text": "Donor-derived infections occur rarely. [5] [6] [7] Nevertheless, both living and deceased organ donors have been implicated in donor-derived infections; transmissible pathogens are diverse and include bacteria (e.g., pyogenic organisms and Mycobacterium tuberculosis), fungi (especially endemic mycoses and Candida), viruses (most commonly herpesviruses), and parasitical organisms (including strongyloides). 5, 7 Standard evaluations of both should include a thorough history of past infections and exposures associated with transmissible infections. 3, 6 Because deceased donor histories are provided by surrogates, they are generally less detailed; however, the increased use of paired kidney exchange has led to increased numbers of evaluations being obtained outside the recipient's center. Whether this impacts on the quality of donor information is unknown. In both cases, laboratory testing should mirror that of the transplant candidate with specific attention to active infections at the time of deceased donation and infections that may reactivate in an immunosuppressed transplant recipient (including herpesviruses, endemic mycoses, and parasitical infections) in both living and deceased donors (see Table 40 .2). Live donors may be evaluated for latent TB using either intradermal tuberculin PPD testing or IGRA. 8 Given the limitations of TB testing in the setting of deceased donor evaluation, it is especially important to obtain historical information and radiography to assess the potential for deceased donor latent infection. 8 The presence of potentially transmissible donor infections may not exclude a donor from transplantation. Donors with bacteremia, meningitis, or other bacterial infections that do not involve the kidney have been successfully used and may be considered, assuming that the donor has been appropriately treated for 24 to 48 hours and there are acceptable antimicrobial treatment options. 6, [9] [10] [11] Latent infections in the donor including TB and endemic mycoses may be treated with appropriate antimicrobials after transplantation. Donors who are actively infected with organisms that do not have effective treatment options should be excluded. Special attention should be paid to deceased donors with undiagnosed central nervous system (CNS) processes as these donors have been implicated in severe and fatal donor-derived infections, including West Nile Virus, rabies, and Cryptococcus; consequently the risks associated with using these donors must be balanced with the need for transplantation. 12 Recent publications have focused on donors who pose an increased risk for blood-borne viral disease transmission because of behaviors associated with recent acquisition of HIV and HCV 13 (Table 40. 4) . Depending on the screening methodology used (serological vs. nucleic acid testing), there is a window of variable duration during which infection may be present but cannot yet be detected. The Public Health Service (PHS) increased risk donor (IRD) criteria attempt to identify donors at risk for window period infections and disease transmission. The absolute risk for disease transmission overall is quite small, but varies based on the risk behavior, the infection in question, and the testing methodology; for example the risk for HIV transmission from a donor who was incarcerated with negative nucleic acid testing (NAT) and antibody testing is 0.9 per 10,000 but the risk for HCV infection from a donor with active intravenous (IV) drug abuse and antibody testing alone is 300 per 10,000. [14] [15] [16] The prevalence of PHS IRDs is increasing and IV drug users represent the largest proportion of this group of donors. [17] [18] [19] Compared with deceased donors overall, PHS IRDs are more likely to be young and male and less likely to meet expanded donor criteria 20 ; despite the better organ quality afforded by these donors, these organs are more likely to be discarded (odds ratio [OR], 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61 to 0.74). 20 However, for recipients who accept these organs, outcomes are equivalent to those observed with non-PHS IRDs. 18, 20 The updated guidelines and Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network policies require NAT testing for all IRDs as well as specify testing for living donors to be performed within the 28 days before the transplant surgery. 13 There was also greater emphasis placed on the informed consent process for recipients and clarification regarding the assays and intervals for posttransplant testing; recipients of PHS IRDs should have serological and NAT testing for HIV, HBV, and HCV performed between 1 and 3 months after transplant and testing for HBV at 1 year.",

Reactivation of latent infections and acquisition of new infections from the environment, other individuals, and the donor may occur; the resulting infections may be more severe in the immunosuppressed host. The pathogens seen during this intermediate period are diverse and in the absence of prophylaxis, include bacteria (e.g., Nocardia species, Listeria monocytogenes, and mycobacteria, especially TB), fungi (e.g., Aspergillus species, Cryptococcus, and Pneumocystis jirovecii), viruses (e.g., CMV, EBV), and parasites/protozoa (e.g., toxoplasmosis). 1 Infections with geographically restricted pathogens including Strongyloides stercoralis, Trypanosoma cruzi, and endemic mycoses (Coccidioides immitis, Blastomyces dermatitidis, and Histoplasmosis capsulatum) also may occur.

Those that occur are typically community acquired infections caused by typical community acquired bacterial and viral infections. 1 Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are especially common and typically caused by Enterobacteriaceae, especially Escherichia coli. 34 Respiratory tract infections also occur, often due to community-acquired viruses (influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and human metapneumoviruses); these may be more severe with prolonged viral shedding, increased risk for lower tract disease, morbidity, and allograft rejection. [35] [36] [37] Bacterial pathogens including legionella and Pneumococcus also occur and transplant patients are at a 12.8-fold greater risk for invasive pneumococcal disease than the general population. 38, 39 Although this late period is not considered to be a highrisk period for opportunistic infections, some may occur after augmentation of immunosuppression. 1 It is important to recognize that the net state of immunosuppression cannot be estimated solely by considering the specific medications, doses, and levels; patient responses may vary considerably. Moreover, there are episodes of later rejection that require additional augmentation of immunosuppression and diabetes mellitus, infections, and malignancies may further increase the risk for later opportunistic infections. One of the more common late-onset opportunists is CMV, which usually occurs following suspension of prophylaxis, especially in CMV-seronegative recipients of CMV-seropositive donor organs. 40 Reactivation of latent infections whose control was dependent on normal T-cell function may occur during this period. For example, histoplasmosis and TB have both been reported; the risk for TB is 20% to 74% higher in transplant recipients than in the general population. 4, [41] [42] [43] The late period is also notable for the occurrence of healthcare-associated infections. Transplant patients are at increased risk for comorbidities, such as malignancy, diabetes mellitus, and vascular disease, conditions that often require additional interventions in healthcare facilities. These have led to infection with hospital-acquired pathogens, including multidrug-resistant bacteria and Clostridium difficile. Diabetic foot infections also may be seen.",

            "text": "CMV is the most common opportunistic pathogen after kidney transplantation. Notable for both direct and indirect effects, it typically occurs in months 1 to 4 posttransplant if no prophylactic antivirals are administered. 40 If prophylactic antivirals are used, the onset of infection is delayed until the antiviral is suspended; post-prophylaxis CMV may occur in posttransplant months 6 to 12. 44 Rarely the onset of CMV is further delayed (late onset), occurring beyond at least 6 months after cessation of prophylaxis. [44] [45] [46] These later infections are differentiated from those occurring shortly after suspension of prophylaxis by their later acquisition, worse allograft function, higher mortality, and absence of association with CMV donor-positive, recipient-negative (D+/R-) serostatus. [44] [45] [46] The manifestations of CMV are diverse. 1, 40 The most common direct effects are asymptomatic viremia; CMV syndrome, which can include fever, malaise, and cytopenias (usually leukopenia and/or thrombocytopenia); and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (including anorexia, diarrhea, abdominal pain, bleeding, ulcerations, and perforation). Disseminated infection, hepatitis, pneumonitis, pancreatitis, and nephritis occur less frequently and chorioretinitis is a rare late manifestation. Of special concern are the indirect manifestations of CMV related to its impact on the host's immune system; decreased allograft and patient survival, increased risk for rejection, and increased risk for opportunistic infections (including fungal infections), posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD), and bacteremia have all been noted. 47, 48 Although the association between CMV and rejection and allograft damage has been recognized for years, the exact mechanism is not known. 49 Some possible mechanisms include upregulation of the inflammatory response with alterations in the expression of cytokines, proinflammatory growth factors, and chemokines and an increase in proinflammatory adhesion molecules. Increased antigen processing and presentation associated with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), alterations in the T-cell subset composition, smooth muscle proliferation with induction of intracellular reactive oxygen species, and increased procoagulant activity have been noted. 47, 50, 51 Notably administration of antiviral prophylaxis to CMV-seronegative recipients of CMV-seropositive organs has been associated with a 50% reduction in organ rejection and improved patient and allograft survival at 3 years, observations that provide further support for the critical role played by CMV with respect to allograft function. 52, 53 Patterns of transmission CMV may occur as a result of primary infection, reactivation of latent infection, or superinfection. Primary infection occurs frequently when a CMV-seronegative recipient receives a CMV-seropositive donor kidney with clinically apparent infection in approximately 45% of recipients in the absence of prophylaxis. 52 Infrequently, primary infection is the result of blood transfusion or close/intimate contact with an individual shedding CMV in their secretions (community acquired). Recipients with primary infection due to organ transplantation are more likely to experience CMV shortly after cessation of prophylaxis. When recognized early, these infections may have limited symptoms with viremia as the most common manifestation. Community-acquired CMV may occur at any time after transplant and because it often is unanticipated, may be more severe. Since the majority of adults are CMV seropositive at the time of transplant, this mode of acquisition is more common in pediatric settings.",

            "text": "MHC-restricted, virus-specific, cytotoxic T lymphocytes play a major role in the control of CMV; consequently immunosuppressive agents that interfere with this host response increase the risk for CMV. 56 Specifically, the use of antilymphocyte antibodies (a frequent component of induction therapy) that ablate lymphocyte function for prolonged periods and prompt the elaboration of proinflammatory cytokines is associated with CMV, as they both allow for reactivation of latent virus and enhance viral replication. Viral reactivation may be promoted by azathioprine, mycophenolate, and cyclophosphamide. Although calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) are not drivers of reactivation, they do allow for amplification of reactivated virus; tacrolimus is more potent than cyclosporine. 57 The use of mTOR inhibitors may reduce the risk for reactivation. 58 In addition to the net state of immunosuppression as defined by the choice of immunosuppression, risk factors for the development of CMV include CMV-seropositive donor, especially if the recipient is CMV seronegative, allograft rejection, coinfections with other viruses (HHV 6), host factors (including genetic factors), and severe hypogammaglobulinemia. 44, 59 Recently, assays designed to assess the cell-mediated immune (CMI) response have been used to assess the risk for CMV. One example of this is the QuantiFERON-CMV assay, which assesses cell-mediated immunity by measuring interferon (IFN)-gamma levels produced by CD8-positive T cells following in vitro stimulation with CMV antigens. 60 Individuals with reduced responses to CMV stimulation were at greater risk for CMV; those who failed to respond to any stimulation were at the highest risk. Allograft rejection and CMV have a uniquely bidirectional interaction, whereby the proinflammatory environment created by rejection and the additional treatment with immunosuppressive agents prompt the reactivation and amplification of CMV and CMV upregulates antigens that promote alloreactivity leading to acute and chronic rejection syndromes. 40, 48, 61 Diagnosis Prompt recognition of CMV is imperative to prevent complications and to improve outcomes. This requires initial consideration based on the clinical presentation and risk assessment. Recipients presenting with unexplained cytopenias, GI complaints, or both should be assessed for CMV, especially if they have risk factors and have recently suspended prophylaxis. Currently, assays targeted at detection of viremia are most commonly used for diagnosis. 62 In particular, NAT uses polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology to measure CMV DNA in plasma to rapidly and accurately determine the presence of CMV in the blood. This assay is quantifiable and higher values typically correlate with more severe disease. It also can be used to follow the course of treatment as effective treatment is accompanied by resolution of viremia. NAT has been notable for interlaboratory variability but the development of an international standard has reduced this variability; regardless comparison of values between different laboratories can still be confusing. 63, 64 Antigenemia testing (a semiquantitative fluorescent assay that stains circulating neutrophils for CMV early antigen [pp65]) can be used to assess viremia. Similar to NAT, this assay can be used to follow the response to treatment. Both assays may be negative in the presence of active infection, especially GI, neurological, and retinal CMV. 62 Consequently, histopathological diagnosis remains the gold standard for CMV diagnosis and patients with consistent clinical syndromes and negative tests for viremia should undergo tissue biopsy. 40, 62 Because of the delay in diagnosis and lower sensitivity, neither culture nor serological testing is routinely used for CMV diagnosis.",

There are advantages and disadvantages to both strategies. 62 Prophylaxis may reduce the indirect effects of allograft rejection and opportunistic infection and decrease the risk for infection with other herpesviruses; the cost and toxicity of prolonged antivirals may be impediments to this approach. The preemptive strategy may reduce the cost of medications and the medication-related adverse events and it also may allow for more effective recovery of the host immune response. But coordination of care and the cost of monitoring may affect the feasibility of this strategy. Notably, neither approach has prevented infection with resistant CMV strains.",

Cytopenias may occur and involvement of the allograft, GI tract, lungs, liver, and CNS have all been described; extranodal disease is especially common with late PTLD. Constitutional B symptoms are sometimes present. Quantitative NAT of whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), plasma, or serum is often used as the first step for the diagnosis of acute EBV and PTLD, but there are a number of issues that limit the utility of this assay for diagnostic purposes. 73, 76 It is important to recognize that specimen selection has a major effect on viral load measurements, since higher viral loads will be seen with whole blood cells or PBMCs. Furthermore, there is still some interlaboratory variability related to the absence of an international reference standard, making it difficult to compare results obtained from different laboratories. Finally, it is important to recognize that PTLD can occur in the absence of viremia and in the presence of viremia may occur in the absence of PTLD. Histopathological diagnosis is ultimately required to make the diagnosis. The World Health Organization has devised criteria for staging PTLD based on the clinical presentation, with early (stage I) disease defined as benign polyclonal proliferation, stage II polymorphic disease, stage III monomorphic B-or T-cell lymphoma/neoplasms, and stage IV disease defined as classical Hodgkin lymphoma. 79",

            "text": "Several common risk factors for BK viremia and nephropathy have been identified. The overall degree of immunosuppression is probably the most important factor, as the prevalence of BK infection has increased as more potent immunosuppression has been introduced and factors augmenting the cumulative immunosuppressive burden, such as rejection episodes or greater HLA mismatching also increase the risk. 90, 91 Older age, male sex, diabetes, and use of ureteral stents also have been implicated as BK risk factors. There is growing evidence to suggest that the infection is donor derived and the absence of prior recipient infection may increase the risk for nephropathy. 92 In one study, donor, but not recipient BK antibody titers were predictive of BK viremia and nephropathy; recipients of high antibody titer donor kidneys had a 10-fold increased risk for BK viremia (10.1; 95% CI, 3.5 to 29; P < 0.001), corroborating earlier work by Bohl et al. 93 Viral Load Monitoring, Diagnosis, and Prevention of BK Nephropathy BK antibodies are not protective and no effective antiviral prophylaxis has yet been identified. Most centers screen prospectively for BK infection by measuring BK viral loads in plasma or urine. Since the majority of BK infections are detected in the first year after transplant, screening is concentrated in the early posttransplant period, although late BK infections have been reported and BK infection should be included in any investigation of allograft dysfunction. 94, 95 The American Society of Transplantation (AST) consensus guidelines recommend screening patients for BK viremia every 1 to 3 months for the first 2 years posttransplant. 91 The majority of transplant centers screen using serum BK PCR but this approach is not mandated and urine BK PCR remains a popular alternative. 96 Due to the lack of a universal standard assay for real-time BK PCR, there is significant interlaboratory variability in the assay's quantification; therefore consistency in the laboratory used for viral load monitoring is important and results that are inconsistent with a patient's clinical course should be questioned. 97 Although a BK viral load >4 log copies/mL is \"presumed\" BK nephropathy, this diagnosis can only be made by kidney biopsy. Although biopsy may not change management, it does provide useful information regarding the degree of inflammation and fibrosis, and by extension, the risk for allograft loss. 98,99 BK nephropathy on biopsy can be mistaken for acute cellular rejection with a lymphocytic infiltrate and tubulitis, and definitive diagnosis is made by demonstrating the presence of immunohistochemical stains directed at the SV-40 large T antigen or VP-1 capsid protein (PAB-597 stain). 100,101",

In vitro data suggest that sirolimus and cyclosporine may have inhibitory effects on BK viral replication, whereas tacrolimus is permissive, suggesting that reduction of tacrolimus may be most beneficial in eradicating BK infection. 105 Both short-and longer-term data suggest that immunosuppression reduction results in BK viral clearance in the majority of patients and does not have a negative effect on allograft or patient survival. 104,106,107 At our center, we discontinue the antimetabolite and monitor BK viral loads every 2 to 4 weeks thereafter; if the viral load does not respond, we then decrease the CNI, aiming for a 25% reduction in the trough level. Anecdotally, we have had success in clearing BK infection in patients with persistent viremia despite tacrolimus trough levels in the 4 to 5 ng/mL range by switching them to cyclosporine and aiming for a trough level of 50 to 75 mg/dL. Serum creatinine must be monitored closely during this period of reduced immunosuppression.",

However, in the limited case series that have had both pre-and posttransplant liver biopsies available, this was not the case. In a series report of 31 patients by Roth et al., 77% (24) had stable or improved histology on follow-up biopsy and only 23% had interval worsening of their liver fibrosis. 124 Another series from France, with sequential posttransplant biopsies in 36 patients, showed a similarly benign posttransplant course; despite increased viral loads, >60% of patients in the study had stable liver fibrosis on repeat biopsy and only 3 patients developed cirrhosis by 20 years of follow-up. 125 Infections may be one source of the increased mortality observed in HCV-positive transplant recipients. Although some reports identified sepsis as an important cause of death in their HCV-positive patients, a recent prospective study from Spain did not observe a difference in the overall incidence of infection among HCV-positive and HCV-negative patients. 126, 127 However, they did observe a significant increase in bacteremia in HCV-positive recipients (HR, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.19 to 8.24; P = 0.02). 127",

The growing opioid abuse epidemic has increased HCV infection rates in certain regions of the United States, leading to an increase in both overdose deaths and donors with HCV infection. Historically, the use of HCV-positive organs has been restricted to recipients with genotype 1 infection. Because donor HCV genotyping is not available before transplantation, clinicians assume HCV-positive deceased donors have genotype 1 infection, since this the most prevalent genotype in the United States. However, superinfection with other HCV genotypes is possible. Since pan-genotypic, IFN-free, direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents to cure HCV exist, this limitation to genotype 1 recipients may be outdated.",

Morales and colleagues reported the outcomes for 162 HCV-positive recipients of HCV-positive kidneys compared with 306 HCVpositive recipients of HCV-negative donors. 128 Patient survival at 5 years was similar (84.8% in D+/R+ vs. 86.6% in D-/ R+; P = 0.25) but allograft survival was diminished (5-year allograft survival 58.9% in D+/R+ compared with D-/R+ 65.5%; P = 0.006). A recent propensity score matched analysis performed using United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) data to address this question found that transplantation with a HCV-positive donor was associated with an increased risk for death (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.76; P < 0.001) and graft loss (HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.16 to 1.67; P < 0.001) among HCVpositive recipients, an effect that was not explained by differences in acute rejection (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.61; P = 0.35). 129 Given the time frame of the study, it is unknown if DAA eradication of HCV would have changed the outcome. The use of HCV-positive donors for HCV-positive individuals is associated with shorter wait times to transplantation (\u223c1 year less on average) but recipients should be counseled about the risks and benefits associated with the use of these donors. 130 Whether HCV-positive donors may be safely used for HCV-negative recipients is currently an area of study now that the potential treatment options for HCV have expanded. 131 Presumably, donors who are not viremic are much less likely to transmit HCV via transplantation; consequently there has been increasing interest in using these donors. More data are needed to determine the safety of HCV-positive donors.",

Since 2013 there has been a rapid expansion in the number of IFNfree DAA regimens approved to treat HCV infection. These regimens have been associated with HCV cure rates in excess of 95% in the general population and have demonstrated efficacy in kidney transplant recipients as well. 132 DAA regimen selection for kidney transplant recipients is complex. Currently, the greatest number of therapeutic options exist for patients with genotype 1 infection, but this area is rapidly changing (the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [AASLD]/Infectious Diseases Society of America [IDSA] guidelines provide the most current treatment recommendations and are continuously updated as new information becomes available). 133 Kidney function and DAA-immunosuppression drug-drug interactions must be taken into account when a DAA regimen is being selected. Sofosbuvir-containing regimens are not approved for use in patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL/min. Regimens that contain simeprevir can increase cyclosporine levels and elbasvir/grazeprovir, when coadministered with cyclosporine increases grazeprovir levels. In addition, regimens that require ritonavir boosting (such as dasabuvir/ombitasvir/paritaprevir) will result in major increases in CNI blood levels and require significant CNI dose adjustment; these regimens are generally avoided in the posttransplant setting. CNI levels have been shown to fluctuate even after DAA treatment is completed, highlighting the need for careful monitoring of kidney function and drug levels both during and after therapy. Prescribers also need to be aware of issues of viral resistance, with appropriate testing for NS5a resistance mutations of genotype 1a patients depending on the regimen selected, as well as reports of hepatitis B reactivation while on HCV therapy. Treatment of HCV in kidney transplant recipients should be managed carefully with combined efforts by hepatologists, infectious disease specialists, and transplant nephrologists.",

Widespread adoption of potent antiretroviral therapy (ARV) has contributed to a decline in ESRD among whites with HIV infection, but rates of ESRD are still disproportionately higher among affected blacks. 141 Kidney transplantation is accepted as the ideal therapy for ESRD, even among HIV-positive individuals, but HIV-positive patients have diminished access to the waiting list and are less likely to achieve kidney transplantation. Of the 309 HIV-positive patients evaluated at a single transplant center from 2000 to 2007, only 20% achieved wait-listing compared with 73% of HIV-negative patients during the same time period. 142 A study of waitlist outcomes for HIV-positive patients demonstrated that although waitlist mortality was similar to HIVnegative patients (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.03; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.20; P = 0.67), HIV-positive candidates were less like to receive a deceased donor transplant (aHR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.01; P = 0.07) and significantly less likely to achieve living donor transplantation (aHR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.64; P <0.001). 143 However, kidney transplantation is associated with a survival benefit, compared with remaining on the waitlist (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 0.21; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.42; P <0.001), for HIV-positive patients, as has been observed for other high-risk patient groups. 144 Due to high patient mortality and high rates of allograft failure in HIV-positive patients transplanted in the pre-ARV era, HIV was once considered a relative contraindication to transplantation. However, with improved HIV patient survival after the widespread implementation of potent ARV therapy, this relative contraindication was reconsidered. After numerous case series reporting promising results, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded a multicenter prospective trial to assess feasibility of kidney transplantation in HIV-positive patients; this study enrolled 150 patients at 19 centers across the United States and followed them for 3 years. 145 Patient survival was 88% and allograft survival was 73.7% at 3 years, similar to outcomes for older kidney recipients as reported in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR), but outcomes were worse for HCVcoinfected recipients. Since the publication of the results of the NIH trial, several groups have examined the national experience with HIV-positive transplantation, using registry data. One study compared outcomes for 492 recipients with HIV and 147 recipients with HIV/HCV coinfection to an uninfected reference group. HIV monoinfected patient mortality (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.24) and allograft loss (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.88) were not statistically different, but there was an increased risk for death (HR, 2.26; 95%, 1.45 to 3.52) and graft loss (HR, 2.59; 95% CI, 1.60 to 4.19) in the HIV/HCV coinfected patients. 146 A \"mate kidney\" analysis, to control for donor quality, found similar results, as did a study matching HIV-positive recipients with HIV-negative controls. 147, 148 Interestingly, Locke et al. demonstrated that experience in HIV-positive transplantation, as reflected in a center's participation in the NIH multicenter trial, did not affect outcomes (patient survival aHR, 1.13; P = 0.63 and allograft survival aHR, 1.08; P = 0.71), but there was an era effect, with patients transplanted between 2008 and 2011 having better outcomes than those transplanted earlier. 149 ",

In the NIH multicenter trial, the incidence of rejection was 31% in the first year, compared with the expected Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) 1-year rejection rate of 12.3% in HIV-negative kidney transplant recipients. 145 A similarly high incidence of rejection has been reported in multiple subsequent case series from the United States and Europe. 150, 151 Excess acute rejection risk may not be entirely due to immune dysregulation from HIV infection; drug-drug interactions, selection of induction and maintenance immunosuppression as well as viral suppression likely also play a role. A recent study demonstrated that patients who had undetectable viral loads for less than 2 years before transplant were 2.48-fold more likely to experience acute rejection after kidney transplantation. 152 An analysis of the SRTR database revealed that HIV-positive patients are less likely to receive lymphocyte-depleting induction therapy than HIV-negative controls (31.4% vs. 55.5%), but use of antithymocyte globulin was associated with a lower risk for rejection (RR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.87; P = 0.02). Maintenance immunosuppression is also important. In that same study, patients on maintenance sirolimus had a higher risk for rejection (aRR 2.15; 95% CI, 1.20 to 3.87) than those on a CNI. 153 Data from a single-center case series suggested that tacrolimus use in HIV-positive recipients is associated with a lower acute rejection risk (21%) than cyclosporine (58%; P = 0.003). 154",

            "text": "Drug-drug interactions between ARVs and CNIs are complex. Protease inhibitors (PIs), historically a main component of ARV regimens, are potent inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A enzyme system, which is the main metabolic pathway for CNIs. When PIs and CNIs are coadministered, the result is higher CNI levels, necessitating CNI dose reductions. For patients on a PI and cyclosporine this means a four-to fivefold lower cyclosporine dose with a 50% increase in the dosing interval, whereas patients on tacrolimus and a PI require an 80% dose decrease and a sevenfold increase in the dosing interval. 155 Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) generally induce CYP3A enzyme activity and cause subtherapeutic levels, but individual effects can vary by NNRTI; this can be more easily overcome by increasing the CNI dose to achieve the desired trough level. In light of these complex interactions, many transplant professionals prefer the use of PI-free regimens whenever possible, favoring regimens based on integrase inhibitors, which permit more \"traditional\" CNI dosing and have been shown to be both safe and effective in the transplant setting. 156 Alternatively, one could consider using belatacept in EBV seropositive recipients to avoid CNI-PI interactions, which has been described in several case reports. 157",

The American Society of Transplantation Infectious Diseases guidelines outline one approach. 159 The authors suggest lifelong prophylaxis against Pneumocystis pneumonia, ideally with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole but atovaquone or dapsone can be substituted for patients with sulfa allergies. CMV prophylaxis is also recommended for at-risk recipients and either valganciclovir or ganciclovir can be used; at many centers the dosing (450 vs. 900 mg/d) and duration of therapy (3 vs. 6 months) mirrors that which is used in the HIV-negative population. Although fluconazole was used selectively by some centers in the NIH trial as antifungal prophylaxis, many centers prefer nystatin to avoid drug-drug interactions with CNIs. Prophylaxis for infections such as toxoplasmosis (when CD4 \u2264200 cells/mm 3 ) with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and Mycobacterium avium complex (when CD4 \u226475 cells/mm 3 ) with azithromycin is also recommended, but since most HIV-positive transplant recipients have robust CD4 counts pretransplantation and rarely have prolonged periods of severe lymphocytopenia posttransplant, this is rarely required. Nine months of isoniazid therapy for any patient with previously untreated latent Mycobacterium TB is strongly advised. Using data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, the HIV Research Network, and UNOS, it was estimated that there were 500 potential HIV-positive donors in the United States per year; but these sources lacked necessary information to assess donor organ quality. 162 A study of HIV-positive patients who died \"in HIV care\" in Philadelphia with more granular clinical information was only able to identify 13 potentially suitable HIV-positive donors over 5 years. 163 The median kidney donor profile index (KDPI), a measure of organ quality, was 95%, indicating that these organs would be considered marginal kidneys. Use of HIV-positive donors in the United States has the potential to increase access to transplantation for HIV-positive individuals, but the extent to which these organs will contribute to the donor pool remains unknown and organ quality may be of concern. A multicenter trial using HIV-positive donors is underway and should provide useful information to guide future use of HIV-positive donors.",

Mortality associated with this infection is high; Transnet revealed a 12-month mortality of 27% although other studies estimated mortality of approximately 14% with baseline kidney failure a risk factor for mortality. 26, 168 Prompt recognition and treatment of cryptococcal infection is critical to patient survival. Many patients present with typical signs and symptoms of basilar meningitis, including headache and visual symptoms, including diplopia. Pulmonary nodules, skin nodules, liver, renal, and rarely bone and joint disease have also been described. 167 Because of the predilection of Cryptococcus for CNS involvement, patients with extraneural disease should undergo lumbar puncture to exclude meningeal involvement. Lumbar punctures should include measurement of opening pressure (an important prognostic indicator) as well as glucose, protein, cell count, fungal culture, and cryptococcal antigen. A serum cryptococcal antigen can be performed but a negative serum antigen does not exclude the possibility of Cryptococcal disease and lumbar puncture and/or tissue biopsy may still be warranted in patients suspected of infection. 167 Optimal treatment of infection depends on the site of disease but ideally includes a 2-week induction phase with a lipid-based amphotericin and 5-flucytosine, followed by fluconazole, for patients with CNS or more severe disease. 167 The optimal duration of therapy is unknown and it is important to follow patients with repeat lumbar punctures and imaging as appropriate to ensure disease resolution. An important complication of cryptococcal infection has been the development of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), especially associated with rapid tapering of immune suppression. 169 This has been manifested by worsening of cryptococcal symptoms and findings; serial lumbar punctures have been required in the presence of IRIS and meningitis to decrease the intracranial pressure. There is no specific treatment for this complication but corticosteroids have been beneficial in anecdotal reports. 167",

Risk factors for the development of invasive pulmonary aspergillus in the multinational study include pretransplant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, serious posttransplant infections, and impaired allograft function. 171 Additional risk factors include hemodialysis and intensified immunosuppression, including prolonged high doses of corticosteroids. 172 Diagnosis requires differentiation of colonization from infection; consequently pulmonary infection requires a combination of imaging (typically computed tomography) and respiratory tract microbiological sampling. Extrapulmonary sites often require tissue biopsy for pathology and culture. Galactomannan obtained from serum or bronchoalveolar lavage can be a useful adjunct to diagnosis but a negative serum galactomannan does not exclude the diagnosis. 172 The treatment of choice has been voriconazole, although there are significant drug interactions that must be managed, especially with CNIs and mTOR inhibitors. 172 In addition, the IV formulation of voriconazole includes a cyclodextran base that can cause hyperviscosity when administered to individuals with CKD. Other azoles, including posaconazole and isavuconazole, echinocandins, and lipid formulation of amphotericin also are effective. It is unknown whether combination therapy will improve outcomes, but the multinational study did not show any benefit in their cohort of renal transplant recipients. 170",

Although relatively uncommon, mortality can be quite high. Increased immunosuppression, especially with agents that reduce the absolute CD4 count, high doses of corticosteroids, CMV, rejection, and proximity to other patients with P. jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) are all recognized risk factors for PJP. 173 Radiographic findings are variable and diagnosis of PJP requires sampling of respiratory secretions, typically via bronchoscopy; cytology and PCR often will provide the diagnosis. Because the burden of organisms is lower than seen with patients with HIV infection, biopsy may be required to exclude the diagnosis. 173 Serum beta d-glucan is often very elevated and this may be a clue to the diagnosis. The treatment of choice is high-dose trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole coupled with a tapering course of higher-dose corticosteroids. 173 Given the potentially poor outcomes in patients with PJP, it is important to provide prophylaxis to at-risk individuals. Commonly 6 to 12 months of trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole is recommended after transplant but longer courses should be considered for patients requiring higher doses of immunosuppression, including for the treatment of rejection. Individuals with CMV are also at increased risk for PJP, so some centers reinstitute PJP prophylaxis for patients who develop CMV infection. Alternative regimens, including atovaquone and dapsone (for patients with normal G6PD levels), can be considered for patients who are allergic to trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole. 173",

Recommended vaccines are included in Table 40 .3. Hepatitis B vaccine is especially important for patients who are listed for transplantation since there is an increased risk for transmission in dialysis centers and patients who are immune may be more safely transplanted with kidneys from donors with a history of hepatitis B or those at increased risk for new hepatitis B infections. Patients with CKD should receive a double dose of the recombinant vaccine and hepatitis B surface antibody levels should be measured following completion of the vaccine series. 182 Historically, there have been some concerns regarding an increased risk for rejection after influenza vaccine due to the development of low level de novo anti-HLA antibodies after immunization. 183 However, the linkage of vaccination to rejection has not been demonstrated and a study examining Medicare claims data in the first year after kidney transplant demonstrated that influenza vaccination was associated with reduced allograft loss and death. 184 Ideally, all vaccines should be updated before transplantation; however, nonlive virus vaccines may be safely administered after transplant. 181 If possible, it may be advisable to delay posttransplant immunization for 6 months to improve vaccine response; if a patient is transplanted immediately before influenza season, vaccines may be given sooner after transplant. Because transplant recipients may have suboptimal vaccine responses, it is important to vaccinate household contacts as well. CKD and transplantation have both been associated with reduced vaccine responsiveness; these individuals should receive conjugate pneumococcal vaccine followed by the pneumococcal polysaccharide capsule vaccine to maximize vaccine response. 185 Vaccine schedules are updated annually; it is important to review to ensure appropriate immunizations are administered. 186 Although kidney transplant recipients are at increased risk for infection, careful consideration of specific infection risks, implementation of preventive measures, and early recognition of infections may mitigate this risk. Given the ever-changing nature of transplantation, ongoing consideration of preventive strategies, including antimicrobials, immunization, and environmental assessments and utilization of directed diagnostic strategies for prompt recognition of infection is essential to optimize posttransplant outcomes.",

The most extensive experience using HIV-positive donors comes from South Africa. Muller et al. reported the results of 27 patients transplanted with kidneys from HIV-positive deceased donors, all with lymphocyte-depleting induction and tacrolimus-based immunosuppression.160 Acceptable outcomes were reported, with patient and allograft survival both 84% at 3 years. Although these results provide evidence of feasibility for HIV-positive to HIV-positive transplantation, the HIV-positive population in the United States is quite different.In the United States the National Organ Transplantation Act, passed in 1984 specifically prohibited organ donation by HIV-positive individuals and the signage of the HIV Organ Policy Equity (HOPE) Act in November 2013 was a significant departure from this policy. The HOPE Act authorizes research in the area of HIV-positive to HIV-positive organ donation and specific research criteria for studies employing these organs have been established, with provisions for both living and deceased donors.161  To date, no living HIV-positive individual has served as a kidney donor but several deceased HIV-positive donor kidney transplants have been performed both in the United States and in Europe.",
