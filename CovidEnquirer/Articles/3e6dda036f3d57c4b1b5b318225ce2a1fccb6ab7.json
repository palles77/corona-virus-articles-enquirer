Wuhan is thought to be the site of earliest COVID-19 occurrence, and cases further afield were infected by SARS-CoV-2 carriers from Wuhan. In particular, the mortality of patients in Wuhan was higher than in any other city in China, at 4.3% compared with 0.8% in the rest of mainland China(updated data available at https://wp.m.163.com/163/page/news/virus_report/index.html?spss=feed&&spssid=a 64bed4d89174914f9792895db5b15e8&spsw=1).

            "text": "One reason for this discrepancy may be that in our study, all the patients were imported cases resulting from serial human to human transmission rather than direct contact with cases in Wuhan. In addition, the altitude at which our cohort lives is higher than 3000 m and so virus viability and virulence may be decreased. The second reason may be that the median age was 39.3 years in our study, which was younger than that reported by Huang et al 7 . Interestingly, the median age of patients with clinical symptoms was older than that of asymptomatic patients (44.9 vs 34.4 years, P=0.02). In general, older persons appear more susceptible to COVID-19 and more likely to suffer severe disease, which may be due to underlying health issues and comorbidities 8 . In our study , the mean age of severe cases were 58.5 years. A further reason for the discrepancy in mortality rates between our study and the national figures may be that because the local CDC actively screened a large number of residents, approximately half of the patients were identified and admitted to hospital before clinical symptoms appeared. Patients therefore received treatment at the earliest stages of disease. Early identification and timely treatment are of crucial importance for effective prevention of severe disease.",
