Growing TMV is as simple as applying virus to abraded leaves of a susceptible plant. The earliest studies of animal viruses were limited to using whole animals. When possible animal pathogens were adapted to small animals such as mice, rats, and rabbits. These small animal models provided a means to study viral pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy. Fertile chicken and duck eggs were, and continue to be, widely used for propagating viruses. In the 1940s and 1950s development of robust cell culture techniques revolutionized the study of animal viruses. Today, most animal viruses are grown in cultured cells.",

Confocal microscopy uses \"point-like\" illumination and detection to reduce out-of-focus glare. The method provides the ability to collect serial optical sections through a thick specimen by collecting and measuring the light intensity originating from numerous thin focal areas in a cell. Confocal microscopy can image either fixed or living cells that have been labeled with one or more fluorescent probes. The excitation energies required to reach deep into the cells are very high and specimen damage can result. In contrast deconvolution methods employ conventional widefield fluorescence microscopes for image acquisition. Excitation intensities can be kept low, resulting in less damage to the specimen.

EM uses an electron beam in place of light, and the beam is focused by electromagnets, rather than by glass lenses. EM has great resolving power and can magnify objects by up to B10,000,000 times. Disadvantages of EM are that fixed and processed samples are dead, and biological samples are heavily damaged by the electron beam even as they are being imaged (sample damage results from the interaction of electrons with organic matter). However, the simple structures and crystalline nature of viruses were first revealed by EM and it remains a common tool of the virologist. In a process called negative staining, heavy metals are used to coat the surface of virus particles to make a \"cast\" or \"relief map\" (Fig. 4 .6). The heavy metal coating is much less sensitive to radiation damage than the biological sample, thus the coated surface structures are well preserved.

Low temperatures provide for better images with less specimen damage, but cryo-EM micrographs have less contrast than stained images. Cryo-EM images are more complex than negative stains because the entire particle (including the interior) is seen in the image. However, thicker frozen specimens can be cut into thin sections using a cryoultramicrotome. Images generated by cryo-EM are often enhanced by collecting and computationally averaging multiple images. This allows use of lower and less damaging doses of electrons. Tomography is a process whereby a series of images are taken with the specimen tilted at different angles relative to the direction of the electron beam. The images are computationally combined to create 3D images (tomograms) of the sample. Extremely highresolution (,4 \u00c5 ) images have been achieved for icosahedral viruses because they are constructed from many repeating subunits that can be computationally averaged.

Groups of infected cells are called foci and the assays are focus-forming assays. Results are reported as focus-forming units (FFU). It is common to take advantage of antiviral antibodies to stain groups of infected cells. The antibodies can be detected if they are tagged with a either a fluorescent molecule or with an enzyme that can cleave an uncolored substrate to produce a colored product. There are several variations on the focus-forming assays but all have in common the identification of small, discrete groups of infected cells in a monolayer culture (Figs. 4.11 and 4.12) .",

For example, if 1 mL of virus sample is added to each of six units, and three of those units are positive at the end of the assay, the TCID 50 is 1. However, the results of endpoint dilution assays are seldom \"perfect\" and calculations based on summing all of the data should be used to derive a titer. End-point dilution assays can be performed using animals and results are reported as Infectious Dose 50% (ID 50 ) or Lethal Dose 50% (LD 50 ), if death is the endpoint. For a given virus sample, the TCID 50 titer is often higher than the ID 50 titer which is often greater than LD 50 titer.

This type of assay requires a panel of viral antigens against which antisera can be tested. It is possible to detect not only antiviral antibody, but also to determine the class of antibodies in the sample. Detection of IgM indicates recent or acute infection, as these are the first antibodies produced in response to infection. Detection of antiviral IgG indicates that the patient is, or has been, infected with a particular virus; however, IgG may also be present due to prior immunization. Measuring IgG levels can be helpful for diagnostic purposes if two patient samples are available: one collected early in the disease process (acute serum sample) and one collected after recovery (convalescent serum sample). If the IgG titer in the convalescent serum is higher (.fourfold higher) than in the acute sample, a diagnosis can be made.",

The process is often used to get pure populations of cells from a mixture. Immunologists take advantage of the fact that different types of proteins are found on the surfaces of different types of lymphocytes. Thus labeled antibodies can be used to quantitate and separate different lymphocyte subsets from a blood sample.

Introducing specific mutation is the \"reverse\" of traditional genetic method of identifying a mutant phenotype and then determining the genetic cause.

Systems to create designer mice are reasonably efficient and hundreds of types of genetically modified mice are commercially available. What is gained by modifying the host? At every step in the virus life cycle, viral proteins interact with cellular proteins and a single viral protein may interact with dozens of cellular proteins. To analyze the effects of just one type of interaction, it may be preferable to modify the host genome. It is also possible to genetically alter a resistant host to render it susceptible to a virus. For example, the receptor for a human virus could be added to mouse cells to generate a tractable animal model. It can be challenging for a student of virology, new to reading scientific literature, to determine the types of virus or host mutations that have been used to obtain data for a specific study.
