Clearly, this infection is highly transmissible from person to person, and healthcare workers are particularly at risk (3) (4) (5) precise routes of transmission in a healthcare setting need to be defined, although the predominance of right lower lobe findings on chest radiography suggests that droplet or airborne transmission is involved.

This finding concurs with those in SARS outbreaks in other countries (6) . Coronaviruses are widespread in the animal kingdom, and human coronaviruses are one of the main causes of the common cold. These viruses are also an important cause of pneumonia in military recruits (7) . The aggressive nature of this disease suggests a new variant coronavirus; preliminary studies (3) (4) (5) confirm this hypothesis.",

However, we did not observe any obvious response to this drug, and several patients deteriorated in spite of its use. In contrast, a number of patients (including our index patient) recovered without use of ribavirin. Although some anecdotal reports of efficacy of ribavirin (when used in conjunction with steroids) exist (4,5), its efficacy is hard to judge for a condition that has potential for spontaneous recovery. Evidence from randomized controlled trials is needed before the use of ribavirin can be advocated for routine use in SARS patients.",
