They shared a connection with the Huanan South China Seafood Market in Wuhan, and now it has been confirmed that the disease is caused by a novel coronavirus (provisionally named 2019-nCoV). As of today (February 14, 2020), 63935 cases have been confirmed in China. Currently, clinicians have found some atypical cases with positive chest CT findings may present with negative results of RT-PCR for 2019-nCoV. The timely diagnosis, isolation and treatment of these patients will help control the further spread of 2019-nCoV.",

Although this patient's multiple specimen tests were negative, repeat chest CT showed a great progression of cloud-like high-density shadows in both lungs compared to the previous chest CT. The imaging characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia may be bifocal extra-zonal distribution, bilateral, multifocal [2] [3] . With typical clinical presentation and a clear epidemiological history, 2019-nCoV infection may be strongly suspected when chest CT has the characteristics of viral pneumonia despite negative RT-PCR results. In these cases, repeat oropharyngeal swab testing and patient isolation should be carefully considered.",
