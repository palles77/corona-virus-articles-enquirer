            "text": "Evidence-based medicine is influential worldwide and has led to new requirements in the field of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). TCM professionals have conformed to this trend and have conducted many studiesguided by the concepts and methods of evidence-based medicine. However, existing systematic reviews of TCM have found no evidence of its effectiveness, leading to confusion. Guo et al 1 suggested that use of a therapy without evidence of its effectiveness is not recommended, because of potential adverse reactions and negative herb-herb and herb-chemical medicine interactions. However, Pittilo et al 2 considered such negative views inappropriate, being based on the few inclusions trials. Lack of evidence does not mean non-existence of evidence. Many problems remain; for example, what can be gained from existing systematic reviews? Is there any clearly confirmed or refuted evidence of efficacy in systematic reviews of the effectiveness of TCM? This study aimed to collect systematic reviews of TCM and undertake content analysis to help solve these problems.",

In addition, the following aspects of systematic review should be fully understood and specified. Topic selection and study design in systematic reviews differ from traditional methods. They should include detailed objectives, target diseases, intervention measures, control measures and clear, specific results indices. For example, TCM is not appropriate as an intervention measure when evaluating the treatment effect of TCM on a certain disease, because there is a large variability and bias will be increased in the evaluation. Regarding choice of results index, 32.12% of systematic review articles in the TCM field used efficiency as the curative effect standard due to a lack or deficiency of gold standards in Chinese medicine diagnosis and classification. However, the definition of efficiency differs between articles and thus an index for the curative effect of TCM is required.",
