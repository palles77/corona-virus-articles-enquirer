As epidemic threats increase so is the potential impact of mathematical and statistical inference and simulation approaches to guide prevention and mitigation plans. As the recent 2013e2016 Ebola epidemic exemplified, an infectious disease outbreak often forces public health officials to make key decisions to mitigate the outbreak in a changing environment where multiple factors positively or negatively impact local disease transmission . Hence, public health officials are often interested in practical yet mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient approaches that comprehensively assimilate data and model uncertainty to 1) generate estimates of key transmission parameters, 2) assess the impact of control interventions (vaccination campaigns, behavior changes), 3) test hypotheses, 4) evaluate how behavior changes affect transmission dynamics, 5) gain insight to the contribution of different transmission pathways, 6) optimize the impact of control strategies, and 7) generate short and long-term forecasts, just to name a few.",

While agent-based models, formulated in terms of characteristics and interactions among individual agents, have become increasingly used to model detailed processes often occurring at multiple scales (e.g., within host vs. population level), models based on systems of ordinary differential equations are widely used in the biological and social sciences. These dynamic models are specified by a set of equations and their parameters that together quantify the spatial-temporal states of the system via a set of interrelated dynamic quantities (e.g, viral load, susceptibility levels, disease prevalence) (Banks et al., 2009) .",

This type of models are often formulated in terms of a dynamical system describing the spatial-temporal evolution of a set of variables and are useful to evaluate the emergent behavior of the system across the relevant space of parameters (Brauer & Nohel, 2012; Chowell et al., 2016a; Strogatz, 2014) . In particular, compartmental models are based on systems of ordinary differential equations that focus on the dynamic progression of a population through different epidemiological states (Anderson & May 1991; Bailey, 1975; Brauer, 2006; Lee, Chowell, & Jung, 2016) . These models are useful to forecast prevalence levels in the short and long-term as well as assess the effects control interventions. In the context of disease transmission, population risk is typically modeled via a \"transmission process\" that requires contact between individuals or between an individual and external factors in the environment. Because the dynamic risk is limited to certain kinds of contact, the vast majority of epidemiological models divide the host population into different epidemiological states. Compartmental modeling allows researchers to address the conditions under which certain disease prevalence levels of interest will continue to grow in the population. Essentially this entails quantifying the factors that contribute to the \"transmission\" process. These models may be deterministic or stochastic, can incorporate geographic space, and can be structured by age, gender, ethnicity, or other risk groups (Sattenspiel, 2009 ). Such structuring is critical, since it defines discrete subgroups, or metapopulations, which may be considered networks wherein the populations are the nodes and their interconnections, the links.",

As a general rule, a parameter is identifiable when its confidence interval lies in a finite range of values (Cobelli & Romanin-Jacur, 1976; Jacquez, 1996; Raue et al., 2009) . Conversely, lack of parameter identifiability can be recognized when large perturbations in the model parameters generate small changes in the model output (Capaldi et al., 2012; Chowell et al., 2006b; Pillonetto, Sparacino, & Cobelli, 2003) . Multiple factors can give rise to lack of parameter identifiability. For instance, structural parameter non-identifiability (Cobelli & Romanin-Jacur, 1976 ) results from the particular structure of the model independently of the characteristics of the observed time series data used to estimate parameters. However, even when structural identifiability is not an issue, a parameter may still be non-identifiable in practice due to other factors including: 1) the amount and quality of the data available and/or 2) the number of parameters that are jointly estimated from the available data. This type of parameter non-identifiability is commonly referred to as practical non-identifiability (Raue et al., 2009) .",

Next, we use the simulated data to attempt to estimate parameters r and p using the GGM from an increasing length of the early growth phase of the daily incidence curve simulated using the GRM. Fig. 10 shows the resulting empirical distributions of the parameters using an increasing length of the growth phase: 10, 20, \u2026, 80 days. Importantly, Fig. 10 shows that using only 10 days of data, it is not possible to reliably estimate the deceleration of growth parameter, p, because its confidence interval ranges widely from 0.5 to 1.0. Indeed, we conclude that it is not possible to discriminate between sub-exponential and exponential-growth dynamics based on data of only the first 10 days. In fact, the corresponding confidence interval of p include the values of 0.5 and 1.0, which indicate that both linear and exponential growth dynamics cannot be ruled out with the data at hand. As more data of the early growth phase is employed to estimate parameters of the GGM, the uncertainty in parameter estimates is not only reduced, but the parameter estimates are better constrained around their true values (Fig. 10) .",

However, it is possible to use the empirical distributions of the parameters to assess the uncertainty associated with composite parameters whose values depend on several existing model parameters and are often useful to gauge the behavior of the modeled system. For instance, a key epidemiological parameter to measure the transmissibility of a pathogen is the basic reproduction number, R 0 (Anderson & May 1991; Diekmann, Heesterbeek, & Metz, 1990; van den Driessche & Watmough, 2002) . This parameter is a function of several parameters of the epidemic model including transmission rates and infectious periods of the epidemiological classes that contribute to new infections. This is an important parameter as it often serves as a threshold parameter for SEIR-type compartmental models. If R 0 > 1 then an epidemic is expected to occur whereas values of R 0 < 1cannot sustain disease transmission. For instance, for the simple SEIR model, the basic reproduction number is given by: 17 .

We can characterize the effective reproduction number and its uncertainty during the early epidemic exponential growth phase (Wallinga & Lipsitch, 2007) . When the early dynamics follow sub-exponential growth, another method relies on the generalized-growth model (GGM) to characterize the profile of growth from early incidence data (Chowell et al., 2016c) . In particular, the GGM can reproduce a range of growth dynamics from constant incidence (p \u00bc 0) to exponential growth (p \u00bc 1) . We can generate the uncertainty associated with the effective reproduction number during the study period directly from the uncertainty associated with the parameter estimates \u00f0b r i ; b p i \u00de where i \u00bc 1; 2; \u2026; S:. That is, R tj \u00f0b r i ; b p i \u00de provides a curve of the effective reproduction number for each value of the parameters b r i ; b p i where i \u00bc 1; 2; \u2026; S: Then, we can compute the curves R tj \u00f0b r i ; b p i \u00de based on the incidence at calendar time t j denoted by I\u00f0t j ; b r i ; b p i \u00de, and the discretized probability Fig. 19 .

This uncertainty quantification approach is computationally intensive and relies solely on case incidence series from an unfolding outbreak and allows considerations of different error structures in the case series data (e.g., Poisson vs. negative binomial).",

Parameter estimates with quantified uncertainty generated using the methodology described in Section 7. The histograms display the empirical distributions of the parameter estimates using 200 bootstrap realizations. The bottom panel shows the fit of the GGM to the 15 weeks of the 2014-15 Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone. The blue circles are the weekly data while the solid red line corresponds to the best fit of the GGM to the data. The blue lines correspond to 200 realizations of the epidemic curve assuming a Poisson error structure. The dashed red lines correspond to the 95% confidence bands around the best fit of the model to the data.",
