            "text": "The demonstration that umbilical cord blood (UCB) contained cells capable of reproducing hematopoiesis in vitro and that they could be cryopreserved for long periods without significant loss in their function paved the way for the use of this new source of stem cells in the field of clinical hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Although the first attempt to transplant UCB was reported in 1972, 6 the first successful related UCB transplant was performed in 1988 in a patient with Fanconi anemia. 7 The first unrelated UCB transplants were then performed in 1993 and the report of a large series of patients was published in 1996. 8 These results prompted the establishment of large repositories of frozen unrelated UCB units, i.e., cord blood banks (CBBs) to support this clinical development. The first UCB bank was set up in 1991 by P. Rubinstein at the New York Center in the United States, 9 and this was followed by the establishment of CBBs in Dusseldorf, Milan, Paris, and London. [10] [11] [12] [13] At present, there are over 130 CBBs all over the world storing over 650,000 unrelated UCB units readily available for transplantation. 14, 15 These CBBs have enabled the performance of over 30,000 unrelated UCB transplants in children and adults with both malignant and nonmalignant diseases. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] With the increased clinical use and exchange of these UCB units it became clear that it was necessary to standardize practices across the various CBBs. In order to contribute to this, a group of experts involved in UCB banking established the NetCord organization in 1998. 22 The initial remit of NetCord was to set up an international registry of UCB and to develop procedures and quality standards for the safe collection, exchange, and clinical use of these banked units. These efforts culminated with the development of the Net-Cord-FACT (Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy) International Standards for Cord Blood Collection, Processing, Testing, Banking, Selection, and Release in 2000 with the last version (5th) published in 2013. 23 These standards form the basis for the NetCord-FACT accreditation program. The American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) has also developed standards and an accreditation scheme, and since 2004 have been incorporated into the Standards for Cellular Therapy Services. 24 Different types of UCB banking programs have been established depending on the genetic relationship of the donated UCB unit with the potential recipient, i.e., allogeneic or autologous, and on the funding sources, i.e., public or private. [25] [26] [27] In the allogeneic setting, an additional distinction needs to be drawn between unrelated (also called altruistic) and related donations. Unrelated allogeneic UCB banking includes the collection, processing, and storage of altruistically donated UCB, in order to create an inventory of HSCs that can be searched for any patient in any part of the world and in need of an unrelated allogeneic HSC donor. These programs are also referred to as public UCB banking.",

[28] [29] [30] [31] Although the standards for the collection of unrelated and related UCB are similar, in the banking of related UCB units, no threshold values for minimum volume collected are required and there is no operational need for volume reduction (VR) of these units, although clinically VR may be beneficial (see below). Also, the exclusion from banking due to microbial contamination does not always apply since antibiotic sensitivity tests can be performed if and when the collection is required for transplantation.",

These units will have to be kept frozen indefinitely unless clear policies regarding their disposal are put in place. With the availability of prenatal genetic diagnosis, including HLA typing, it will be possible to collect units selected only from HLA-identical siblings, as has already proved possible. 32 So far, the majority of the transplanted related UCB units have been fully HLA-matched and in patients with hemoglobinopathies. In fact, in some centers, related UCB transplantation is the first line of treatment for patients with thalassemia major. 33 In most European countries, these two types of allogeneic UCB banking (unrelated and related) are carried out by government-administered institutions and funded by the national health systems available in each country.",

Worldwide, many private CBBs are collecting and storing UCB for eventual autologous or family use. Although there are more than 1 million of these units stored in private CBBs, a very small number have been transplanted, mostly with unknown outcomes. There are anecdotal cases of autologous UCB transplantation, but in general the scientific and clinical arguments for the banking of these units are not universally accepted. 34 There are also a number of ethical issues associated with this practice, which have been extensively reviewed. [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] Furthermore, it appears that quality parameters for privately stored units seem to be inferior to those measured in those stored in public CBB, highlighting the fact that if the clinical value of autologous UCB transplantation is established, the issue of the quality of these units will become even more relevant. 40 Alternative models of CBB, called hybrid or mixed, have been developed and in these programs the UCB collection is carried out on behalf of (and paid for) the family requesting the collection for either autologous use or for a named person within the family. In one of these models, the collection is split into three and 1/3 is donated to the unrelated public bank and the other 2/3 is stored as a private collection. However, with the increasing evidence on the impact of high total nucleated cell (TNC) and CD34+ cell content on the clinical outcome of UCB transplantation, which is directly correlated with the volume collected, the value of these small volumes of UCB is limited. The other \"mixed\" model involves the collection and storage of the UCB, for a fee, for autologous or for a named family member, but in this case, the relevant information on the UCB unit is made accessible to unrelated donor registries. Once or if the unit is selected for an unrelated patient, the family is then asked to release the stored unit with the consequent refund. To date, no evidence on the application of this model has been presented.",

[59] [60] [61] Furthermore, World Marrow Donor Association (WMDA) data indicate that the minimum cut-off TNC and CD34+ count of the transplanted units have increased throughout the years. 14 Thus, in order to ensure that the stored units can meet the requirements of transplant center acceptable values for volume, TNC and CD34+ cell content of the UCB units collected (i.e., preprocessing) are established by each CBB program in order to compensate for the cell loss occurring during the processing of the units at various stages of the procedure (approximately 10%). Therefore, in order to improve the quality of the units banked and to minimize the costs of CBB, most UCB banks evaluate the collected units for a number of parameters before processing a unit, and these include volume, TNC, CD34, and colony forming unit (CFU) content. [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] The volume of the collected unit was the original parameter used to select those collections that should proceed to processing and subsequent banking and it remains a simple, fast, and cost-effective surrogate marker to be used in the assessment of the collected units. Although the collected volume has a strong correlation with the TNC content, most CBBs use the TNC parameter to inform decisions throughout the CBB process and for the selection of the UCB unit for transplantation.",

Today, this test has become more standardized and it is now also possible to assess simultaneously both the percentage of CD34+ cells and viability. 70 It has been suggested that the potency of the UCB measured by the number of CFUs is strongly positively associated with engraftment rates in children. 71 Page et al. have shown that the potency of the units (measured by the CFU content) was a strong predictor of engraftment. 72 Current methods for assessing the number of CFUs are complex and time-consuming, and unless these assays are performed on every single unit banked at a considerable cost bearing in mind that only about 1-2% of banked units are issued for transplantation. Also, the results may not be available when the unit is requested (they can take up to 14 days). Alternative methods to assess the function or potency of the UCB units have been recently described and are currently undergoing a more extensive clinical evaluation. Our own studies have shown a very good correlation between the amount of volume collected with the TNC, CD34, and CFU content of the units (see Figure 2 ).",

With the shortening of the window period of infectivity by the introduction of nucleic acid testing for human immunodeficiency virus/hepatitis B virus/hepatitis C virus, it should be possible to eliminate the need for a second 6-month followup sample from the mother to retest for infectious disease markers. This requirement was one of the important reasons why significant numbers of units had to be discarded, in spite of their compliance with the banking requirements. Also, mostly depending on the country of origin of the motherdonors, additional screening, such as tests for malaria, Chagas disease, and, more recently, West Nile virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome, are required to comply with regulations in each country. The UCB unit is also tested for these markers, once selected for transplantation.",

Low-resolution HLA-ABC and high-resolution HLA-DRB1 typing should be performed prior to the listing of the units with the relevant UCB or adult unrelated HSC donor registries. A number of recent publications have indicated that if the transplanted UCB unit is a mismatch at one of the noninherited maternal HLA alleles, there is an improvement in the outcome of this transplant. 86, 87 As a result, a number of UCB banks are now typing and reporting the maternal HLA type of the listed units. The role of the KIR receptor/ligand mismatching is still controversial; 88, 89 therefore, the majority of CBBs do not routinely test their units for these markers before listing them in the national or international HSC registries.",

All units are listed under a unique identifier with the following information: HLA type, volume of collected UCB, and TNC (and CD34+, CFUs, and maternal HLA typing if available) of the final product. The issue as to whether the CD34 count should be included at registration is currently under discussion. Some CBBs are also registering the HLA typing of the mother of the CBU in order to provide the option of selecting mismatched CBU based on the noninherited maternal antigens (NIMAs.) At present, there are several international registries, NetCord listing only UCB units and AsiaCord and Bone Marrow Donors Worldwide (BMDW), which contain both adult HSC donors and CBUs (http://www.bmdw.org). The National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) also lists units of its associated partners for searches. 90 There are approximately 200,000 CBUs in NetCord, and over 600,000 registered with BMDW. 15 Most units registered with NetCord are also in BMDW (see Figure 4 ). In future, with the implementation of the European Marrow Donor Information System (EMDIS) Cord, an electronic system designed for the rapid exchange of information and requests between transplant centers and donor registries, this system should speed up the whole process of donor searches and selection, since all relevant information about a UCB unit will be readily available.",

This limitation, which seems to be primarily due to the insufficient number of HSC and to immunological na\u00efvety of the immunological effectors, such as T cells in the UCB collections, has led to the development of a number of approaches to improve these outcomes. Of these the most successful so far has been the use of two UCB units for an individual patient in order to increase the number of transplanted HSCs. [111] [112] [113] This approach has yielded comparable results to those using a single CBU, and has opened the way for using UCB transplantation in older and heavier patients. The initial protocol developed by the Minneapolis group has now been adopted by many centers with or without modifications and has allowed the performance of UCB transplantation in patients not previously considered for the procedure due to their age or weight.",

This forms the basis for the Department of Health accreditation scheme to which all CBBs within the United Kingdom are required to be licensed, with inspections carried out by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.99   In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2005 introduced the regulation of the manufacture of unrelated UCB to support the compliance of the Current Good Tissue Practices 21 CFR 1271.210. Later on in 2007, the FDA issued a draft guidance recommending the licensure of CBB for the manufacture of UCB units. This was finally implemented in 2011 and requires that all manufacturers of UCB units need to have an approved Biologics License Application or Investigational New Drug Application in order to be able to import a UCB into the United States. This regulation treats a UCB unit as a biological drug.100,101",
