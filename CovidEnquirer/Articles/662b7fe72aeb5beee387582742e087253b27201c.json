We prepared Nextera libraries for all 32 samples. Using the Kulesh qRT-PCR assay, we detected EBOV RNA in 18 of these samples, including 2 discharge samples and 3 samples unassociated with a particular case. After library construction, we used Kulesh qPCR to detect the presence of any EBOV copies in the libraries. Based on the results, we sequenced 23 samples using a combination of the MiSeq and HiSeq 2500 platforms (Illumina). We were able to generate assembled EBOV genomes from 12 of these samples, all from confirmed EVD cases with associated case histories. We combined the MiSeq and HiSeq sequencing data from RUN and the Broad Institute for analysis. The median sequencing coverage was 225.5\u00d7 (range, 6-4864\u00d7) ( Table 1 ). Although we recorded combined sequencing data, the MiSeq data from RUN separately confirmed EBOV reads in 6 of the 12 samples with assembled EBOV genomes.",

These variants were present in all Nigerian samples sequenced, including the index case (we note that 2 samples did not have coverage at position 18 574). Two of these variants were unique to Nigeria, and 1 variant, at position 18 754, was also seen in 2 EBOV genomes from Liberia (accession Nos.

Eight of these iSNVs were shared by \u22652 samples, and 2 iSNVs (positions 7551 and 10 503), both found in sample E027, were also consensus variants in sample E030.

Second, even when iSNV data are available, it may not all be meaningful. Some of the iSNVs we observed have previously been documented in unrelated data sets from Sierra Leone and Liberia [2, 13, 18] ; these included all 8 of the shared iSNVs. Most of our iSNVs, including most shared iSNVs, were low-frequency frameshift insertions or deletions. Because they can disrupt protein structure, they are unlikely to be transmitted. More likely, these recurrent iSNVs represent either recurring mutations in highly mutable regions of the EBOV genome or sequencing errors, especially because many of them occur in homopolymer regions. In either case, their value for determining transmission chains is uncertain.

We do not, however, find them in the sample from the index patients, either as consensus SNPs or as iSNVs, despite high sequencing depth. Nor do they appear as consensus SNPs in the other cases derived from the index case, or as iSNVs in the one other case that was deeply sequenced and was sampled around the same time as samples 6 and 9. The explanation may simply be that the variants were present in the index patient but at too low a frequency for us to detect. It is also possible that their frequency changed in the index patient between the time he was sampled and transmission to the other cases, or that they differed across tissues within the patient.
