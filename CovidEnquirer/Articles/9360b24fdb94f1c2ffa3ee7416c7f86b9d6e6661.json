            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) is a coronavirus that causes sporadic fatal disease in cats characterized by vasculitis, granulomatous inflammation and effusive pleuritis/peritonitis. Histologic changes in lymphoid tissues include lymphoid hyperplasia, lymphoid depletion, histiocytosis, and granuloma formation. Although viremia occurs, histologic lesions are not found uniformly throughout lymphoid tissues. We used experimental infection of cats with a highly pathogenic FIPV isolate, UCD8, to study histologic lesions, virus replication, and cytokine expression in multiple lymphoid tissues during the effusive phase of disease. Viral RNA was found in 76% of central tissues (mediastinal lymph node, spleen, mesenteric lymph node) examined, as compared to 27% of peripheral tissues (popliteal lymph node, cervical lymph node, femoral bone marrow). All tissues positive for virus replication also demonstrated lymphoid depletion. Generally, affected tissues had lower levels of IL-4 and IL-12-p40 mRNA and higher levels of IL-10 mRNA. Although no differences in IFN-\u2425 or TNF-\u2423 mRNA were measured, TNF-\u2423 protein expression was greater in affected tissues and demonstrated a shift in the source of TNF-\u2423 from macrophages to lymphocytes. Together, these results colocalize FIPV replication, lymphocyte depletion in tissues, and alterations in cytokine transcription and translation. A possible role for TNF-\u2423 in the previously described FIPV-induced lymphocyte apoptosis is also suggested.",

The immunopathogenesis of FIPV infection is multifaceted and correlates with the clinicopathologic features of the disease. Cats acquire the infection either through excreted virus from other FIPV-infected cats or through mutation of an endogenous enteric coronavirus (feline enteric coronavirus) that is ubiquitous and minimally pathogenic among cats (Vennema et al., 1995 (Vennema et al., , 1998 . The increased pathogenicity of FIPV, as compared to the feline enteric coronavirus (FCoV), may be related to an increased macrophage tropism of FIPV (Pedersen, 1987; Stoddart and Scott, 1989) . Infection and replication of FIPV within macrophages allows rapid dissemination of the virus throughout the body (Pedersen, 1987; Weiss and Scott, 1981c) . Antibody against the virus is not protective, but rather often enhances virus infection of macrophages, resulting in an accelerated disease course (Addie et al., 1995; Pedersen and Boyle, 1980; Scott et al., 1995; Vennema et al., 1990; Weiss and Scott, 1981a,b,c) . In addition, antigen-antibody complex deposition in organs contributes to the clinical disease (Jacobse et al., 1980) . Granulomatous inflammation on serosal surfaces, vasculitis and effusive peritonitis/pleuritis are the hallmark histopathologic features (Pedersen, 1987; Weiss and Scott, 1981c) . In contrast to the destructive effects of the inflammatory and humoral response, a strong cell-mediated immune response is associated with immunity and recovery (Pedersen, 1987; Weiss and Cox, 1989) . Although the inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and IL-6 have been shown to increase with FIPV infection, a comprehensive study of type 1, type 2, and inflammatory cytokines has not been performed to date (Goitsuka et al., 1987 (Goitsuka et al., , 1988 (Goitsuka et al., , 1990 (Goitsuka et al., , 1991 . We have evaluated the cytokine response in multiple lymphoid tissues of FIPVinfected cats and suggest a role for cytokines in the immunopathogenesis of the histologic lesions.",

Briefly, a standard curve was generated by performing RT-PCR on a series of samples containing 10-fold dilutions of native RNA template with a constant amount of competitor RNA. To quantify cytokine RNA in unknown samples, a competitive RNA template was added to 1 g RNA from unknown samples, reverse transcribed, amplified by PCR, then analyzed by densitometry on agarose gel. For each cytokine mRNA quantification, the standard curve samples and unknown samples were processed simultaneously to eliminate batch to batch variability. A common cocktail for each batch of RT reactions and PCR reactions was used to minimize sample to sample variability. All RT reactions were 20 l and PCR reactions were 50 l. Competitor RNA, synthesized native RNA, and unknown RNA were always standardized so that the RNA was added to the RT reaction in 5 l aliquots. Samples from PCR reactions were then separated by electrophoresis through a 3% Metaphor agarose gel (FMC Bioproducts, Rockland, ME). The gel was stained in ethidium bromide and an image of the gel was captured using a FOTODYNE Eclipse enclosed darkroom (FOTODYNE Inc., Hartland, WI). Band intensities were determined by Collage densitometry software (FOTODYNE Inc., Hartland, WI). A standard curve was constructed by plotting the log ratio of native to MIMIC band intensities versus the number of copies of native RNA (Zachar et al., 1993) . Cytokine mRNA copy number was determined by interpolation from the standard curve.",

This strain was previously reported to cause fatal peritonitis in four of the four cats (Pedersen, 1976) . Although all six cats in the current study seroconverted, none demonstrated any clinical signs of infection. These six and an additional six SPF cats were then inoculated IP with ascites fluid from a cat that succumbed to infection with FIPV isolate UCD8 (Hickman et al., 1995; Vennema et al., 1995) . The clinical signs, survival time and serologic data for all 12 cats are shown in Table 1 . The failure of UCD1 to cause peritonitis was unexpected; however, the inoculum used in this study was derived from tissue culture adapted UCD1 that had been repeatedly passed, and it is possible that mutations occurring over time in tissue culture attenuated this strain. Ten of the 12 cats inoculated with UCD8 demonstrated severe clinical signs necessitating euthanasia, while 2 cats showed no clinical signs of disease. Cats exposed to UCD1 and succumbing to disease after inoculation with UCD8 had a significantly shortened survival time as compared to cats that succumbed to disease but were only exposed to UCD8 (mean of 4.6 days versus 8.6 days, P = 0.004, Student's t-test). This is consistent with several previous reports demonstrating antibody-dependent enhancement of disease progression in seropositive cats subsequently exposed to FIPV (Pedersen and Boyle, 1980; Scott, 1987; Scott et al., 1995; Vennema et al., 1990; Weiss and Scott, 1981a,b) .",

Both central lymphoid tissues (mesenteric lymph node, mediastinal lymph node, spleen and thymus) and peripheral lymphoid tissues (popliteal lymph node, cervical lymph node, and femoral bone marrow) were examined. Virus was found in 75% of central tissues (36 of 48 tissues examined) compared to 27% of peripheral tissues (9 of 33 tissues examined) ( Table 2 ). Shedding of virus in feces was demonstrated in 3 of 12 cats. Histological lesions colocalized with virus. Lymphoid depletion, lymphoid necrosis/ apoptosis, and pyogranulomatous inflammation were more prevalent in central tissues while lymphoid hyperplasia was more likely to occur in peripheral lymphoid tissues (Table 2 ). In all tissue where virus was detected by RT-PCR, lymphoid depletion or necrosis/apoptosis was observed. No lymphoid depletion or necrosis/apoptosis was evident in tissue negative for viral RNA. In these studies, we did not determine whether lymphocyte destruction was due to necrosis versus apoptosis. Both processes have been previously described in FIPV-infected cats (Haagmans et al., 1996) . Recent studies have shown apoptosis is a common feature in the pathogenesis of infection for several Coronaviridae members (An et al., 1999; Belyavsky et al., 1998; Liu et al., 2001; Sirinarumitr et al., 1998) . FIPV, in particular, induces lymphocyte apoptosis predominantly in the CD3+ T-cell population (Haagmans et al., 1996) . Depletion of circulating lymphocytes is also a common feature of FIPV infection and was observed in this study as well (Fig. 1) . However, the lymphopenia was not due to depletion of a specific phenotype as CD4+ Tcells, CD8+ T-cells, and B-lymphocytes were markedly reduced in all cats with clinical disease (data not shown). ",

We postulate that excessive TNF-\u2423 production by activated T-cells may induce lymphoid depletion via apoptosis. Studies of FIPV and other Coronaviridae support apoptosis as a key pathogenic mechanism. Furthermore, Haagmans et al have shown ascites from FIPV-infected cats induces apoptosis in activated lymphocytes from uninfected cats, as does TNF-\u2423 (Haagmans et al., 1996) . In those studies, attempts to inhibit TNF-\u2423 in the ascites and prevent apoptosis were unsuccessful, however, only anti-human TNF-\u2423 antibodies were employed. It is possible that the anti-human antibodies did not inhibit the feline TNF-\u2423 or that the mechanism of apoptosis is different depending on whether the lymphocytes are from FIPV-infected versus non-infected cats.",

Na\u00efve T-cells resist apoptosis but become highly susceptible when cell cycling is initiated in response to antigen (Boehme and Lenardo, 1993; Lenardo, 1991; Russell et al., 1991) . Lymphocyte activation results in upregulation of the death domain of the TNF-\u2423 receptor (TNFR) superfamily and their ligands. This is an important mechanism for downregulating the immune response normally. In this situation, TNF-\u2423 is mainly produced by activated T-cells and macrophages (Chicheportiche et al., 1997; Marsters et al., 1996; Tartaglia and Goeddel, 1992) . It is possible that the apoptosis observed in FIPV-infected lymphoid tissues is due to excessive TNF-\u2423 induced apoptosis of FIPV antigen-stimulated lymphocytes. Further studies are required to conclusively demonstrate this as an important mechanism for FIPV-associated lymphocyte destruction in vivo.",

            "text": "Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain why most cats fail to generate a protective cell-mediated response against FIPV. The first hypothesis suggests apoptotic destruction of activated T-cells could undermine the cell-mediated response. It is clear that lymphocyte apoptosis is an important feature of FIPV disease and the consequent lymphopenia leads to immunosuppression. Similar lymphocyte apoptosis and immunosuppression has been described in sepsis and acute measles infection (Ayala et al., 1995; Bone, 1996; Hotchkiss et al., 1997; Okada et al., 2000; Wang et al., 1994) . Our data supports a scenario of lymphoid destruction in the presence of FIPV antigen that may be mediated by lymphocyte-produced TNF-\u2423. The second hypothesis suggests that cytokine expression could be biased toward a type 2 profile. The humoral response observed in FIPV-infected cats and high IL-10:IL-12 ratios measured in infected central lymphoid tissues supports such a bias. However, low IL-4 mRNA levels in infected tissues are more consistent with a mixed cytokine profile. Therapeutic approaches to limit lymphocyte destruction could allow a protective type1 cytokine profile and cell-mediated response to occur and perhaps this could be achieved by blocking TNF-\u2423 activity.",
