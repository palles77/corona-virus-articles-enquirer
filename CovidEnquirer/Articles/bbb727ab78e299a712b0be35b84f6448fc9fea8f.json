Introduction R espiratory tract infections are common presentations among emergency department (ED) patients, some of whom may present an infectious risk. Unfortunately, definitive identification of the offending agent is generally not possible at the initial ED visit. Potential respiratory agents that the 21 st century emergency physician must consider include the traditional respiratory pathogens and also emerging (eg, severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]), highly virulent (eg, avian inf luenza virus), resistant, and even bioterrorism-related agents. Thus, within the ED there is a potentially dangerous mixture of infections with serious possible public health consequences. Threat of contagion exists for uninfected patients (in the ED, the hospital at large, and the community) and health care personnel (including ED physicians). Through implementation of the most up-to-date guidelines, health care personnel can aid in minimizing respiratory infection transmission and protect patients and other hospital personnel from infection.",

            "text": "The potential risk for respiratory infection-related morbidity and mortality is compounded in the ED because of the increasing number of immunocompromised ED patients. Populations at increased risk include organ transplant patients, 1 HIV-infected patients, and postchemotherapy patients, all of whom are living longer because of improved lifesaving therapies. 2 Crowded and understaffed EDs further elevate risk of contagion and possible public health disasters. Two potentially lethal infections that are transmitted by the respiratory route, which most emergency physicians are familiar with, are Neisseria meningitis (which causes meningococcemia) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. These agents are relatively uncommon, however, in most US EDs, and as recently as 2003, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that health care facility environments are rarely implicated in respiratory pathogen transmission (except in cases of immunocompromised patients). Case reports of transmission of SARS among hospital workers from that year resulted in heightened awareness of the need for increased attention to respiratory precautions. For example, according to Lau et al, 3 44% of SARS cases (68/156 cases) at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong occurred in hospital workers who did not take special protective measures during the SARS outbreak. Another study found that failure of providers to recognize risk, implement strict isolation measures, and diagnose disease was responsible for the majority of nosocomial cases of SARS in Hong Kong (with the vast majority of cases occurring among physicians and nurses). 4 Internationally, health care worker infection has proven to account for up to 42% of SARS cases in Canada and approximately 25% of cases in Hong Kong. 4, 5 These findings provide compelling data that hospital workers are at significant risk of contracting respiratory infections and establish an imperative for initiating broad-scale infection control measures.",

            "text": "The participation of emergency physicians and nurses is critical for effective responsiveness to respiratory threats in hospitals. ED personnel represent a critical link in the chain of communication and response, along the continuum from the community to the inpatient unit. Policies should anticipate responses to the complex spectrum of possible respiratory illnesses, from highly transmissible and unexpected emerging global diseases such as SARS to yearly inf luenza epidemics. Lessons from the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 , and other recent disasters emphasize the importance of integrating the public health system with both medical and mental health services, with close attention to capacity management and surge planning. Organizational systems thus require that disaster and public health planning at regional and state levels produce systems that integrate the ED (the likely focal point for patients with acute respiratory infections) with hospital and regional response plans and resources. 6, 7 The purpose of this report is to summarize, from both the peer-reviewed literature and public health sources (eg, from the CDC), information most relevant to ED respiratory infection control. Specific and current recommendations and guidelines are provided, along with evidence supporting specific respiratory infection control measures, when available. The review is divided into 3 sections, addressing administrative, patient-related, and legal issues, with some unavoidable overlap occurring. Administrative topics include public health coordination, facility planning, and health care worker issues. The patient-related portion covers patient f low from out-of-hospital and triage to waiting room and ED treatment areas, with inclusion of a discussion of patient education and patient transport. The legal section summarizes federal and local laws pertinent to respiratory hygiene. Because SARS represents the most recent significant respiratory pathogenic threat, many of the successes and challenges about respiratory infection control reference studies from the SARS outbreak. While this research is SARS specific, lessons that may be generalizable about infection control are provided. Further, although an all-inclusive discussion about respiratory hygiene is impossible, this summary provides the most relevant and practical information for the practicing emergency physician, with specific references provided for particular topics to allow more detailed review. BACKGROUND According to a recent national ED-based survey, acute respiratory infections are the leading ED ''illness-related'' diagnosis. 8 Another recent study from the pediatric literature reported that acute respiratory illnesses are the second leading category of adolescent diagnosis from ED visits among virtually every age group (except women aged 18 to 21 years). 9 The significant inf lux of patients expected during an outbreak (such as SARS or avian inf luenza) would result in an even greater proportion of ED patient visits for respiratory-related complaints.",

Emergency physicians should take a lead role in development and implementation of policies because the ED serves as the initial entry point for many patients. Policies to address routine respiratory pathogens (eg, tuberculosis [TB] and inf luenza A), emerging pathogens (eg, SARS or avian inf luenza), and bioterrorist agents are necessary. The CDC has provided detailed recommendations about health care facility response preparedness for a SARS outbreak (available online at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/guidance/C/recommended.htm). Although these may not all be generalized to every new respiratory threat, the principles described in the reference can guide institutional preparation for any large-scale respiratory pathogen threat. Similar readiness plans for bioterrorism preparedness have been devised and published conjointly by the CDC and the Association of Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology. 12 with specific operational plans for handling a large inf lux of potentially infectious patients in the event of a significant outbreak. 13 When patient inf lux exceeds institutional capacity, plans should designate alternative triage and treatment areas either outdoors or in other nearby large-capacity facilities. 14 Although plans may designate patient care areas that exceed hospital capacity, staffing issues may limit the ability to actually use these areas in a real event. Community isolation and treatment facilities may also be activated; a prototype for such a facility was developed by the CDC for SARS. In general, community facilities will likely house and treat patients with milder disease, with the public health department coordinating these procedures and venues. Community isolation facilities (eg, motels, hotels) should have rooms that are equipped with private bathrooms, as well as receptacles to dispose of soiled linen and contaminated waste. Personnel who work at the facility should also have N-95 respirators available, as well as disposable gowns and gloves. In general, patients at these facilities will be expected to care for themselves. 15 Summary and level of supporting evidence for standard precautions (see Figure 1 for definitions of levels of grading); available at: http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/hip/isolat/std_prec_ excerpt.htm.

A 1995 study found that less than 20% of EDs had negative-pressure isolation rooms. 17 In a recent press release from November 2005, American College of Emergency Physicians leaders warned that there is an urgent need for increased ED and hospital planning, specifically citing lack of adequate surge capacity, isolation facilities, and staff to treat the large increase in the number of patients that may result from an inf luenza pandemic. 18 Depending on the circumstances of the outbreak, public health officials may recommend keeping suspected noncritical infectious patients at home. The CDC's guidelines for home isolation for SARS and pandemic inf luenza serve as prototypes. 19, 20 Alternatively, specific health care facilities may be designated as referral centers for suspected cases. 15 Although the public health department will ultimately be responsible for coordinating implementation of these types of large-scale overcapacity plans, emergency physicians need to understand the types of options available.

Effective communications mechanisms between EDs and health departments are required to allow contact tracing of potentially exposed patients, visitors, and health care workers who live in the community. Contact tracing involves either active or passive monitoring. Active monitoring consists of direct public health contact (telephone or in person), for example, once a day for exposed persons to assess for symptoms and address any needs. Passive monitoring relies on the affected person's contacting the health authorities if symptoms develop. Methods of monitoring depend on the exposure risk and capacity of the public health infrastructure. Regardless of the type of monitoring recommended, all individuals in contact with a potentially infectious person need to be advised of symptoms and what to do if symptoms develop. Additionally, persons with high-risk exposures may require activity restrictions.

Telephone numbers for the local health department should be readily available in all EDs. COMMUNICATION Policies should include clear designations of specific persons within the hospital who are responsible for communication with public health officials (eg, hospital infection control officer) and dissemination of up-to-date information to health care staff (eg, hospital chief executive officer). Policies need to include processes for initiating communication with key public health officials after hours and on weekends and guidance about when communication should be initiated. Potential community contacts should be identified in advance and be capable of effectively communicating needs and concerns of the public. 6 Facility Planning",

The most effective practices from each category should be implemented according to characteristics of the responsible agent.

Research has demonstrated that inf luenza vaccination of health care workers contributes to a substantial decrease in patient mortality, 32 which has led some experts to call for mandatory vaccination of health care workers. 33 The CDC provides specific recommendations about when to provide chemoprophylaxis for inf luenza, 34 which may be used as a template and adapted to other pathogens when guidelines are developed for new and emerging pathogens for which vaccines are available. Vaccinations plans for certain agents (eg, anthrax and smallpox) are controversial. Currently, preexposure anthrax vaccine is not recommended for health care workers. After the terrorist attacks of 2001, the US government developed a smallpox vaccination plan that included ''formation of smallpox response teams'' at each institution. Emergency physician volunteers participated as critical members of the team. Although controversy still exists in the emergency medicine community about these recommendations, 35 they remain. Because the threat of a true smallpox event remains low, however, routine vaccination for all health care workers for smallpox is not recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice. 36 Facilities should create a priority list for employee smallpox vaccination in the event of an outbreak, and emergency staff should be included.",

Several hospital-and ED-based studies provide data that demonstrate that lack of either provider education or adherence to institutional guidelines or inadequate diagnostic evaluation of patients at risk results in increased risk of disease transmission. 3, 5, 16, 17, 39 Underscoring this is the findings from one epidemiologic outbreak of SARS in Toronto that found that 36% of new infections in the hospital occurred in health care workers, with the highest rates in those working in EDs and ICUs. 5 Both the World Health Organization and the CDC provide general recommendations for handling of patients with suspected respiratory infections that include having triage staff adhere to proper hand hygiene procedures and donning face masks and eye protection. 40, 41 If SARS or TB is suspected, health care workers in EDs should don an N-95, 99, or 100 respirator. 42 The degree of vigilance that should be applied to screening for respiratory infections depends on the current risk level, with the most up-to-date regional risk information based on surveillance data provided on a CDC Web site. 43, 44 For example, there are 3 basic risk levels that apply to SARS: (1) no current SARS transmission anywhere in the world, (2) active SARS transmission in limited geographic areas, and (3) SARS transmission within the community in which one is practicing. In the absence of person-to-person transmission of SARS worldwide, the goal of domestic surveillance is to maximize early detection of cases while minimizing unnecessary laboratory testing and social disruption. In the absence of known transmission worldwide, the overall likelihood that a person in the United States with fever and respiratory symptoms will have SARS is exceedingly low. 45 If SARS transmission is present in limited geographic areas, screening should focus on identifying persons with possible geographic exposures. When person-to-person SARS transmission is present in the community, everyone with fever or respiratory symptoms should be screened for SARS.",

Various similar ED-based triage guidelines for specific agents (eg, TB, inf luenza and avian inf luenza) 13,17,34 that include use of early radiography have been developed, and the CDC Web site (available online at http://www.cdc.gov) should be consulted for the most up-to-date recommendations, as well as the current threat level of SARS. 44 From the ED perspective, development of decision guidelines may be based on the characteristics of the epidemic and may require development and modification in real time. An excellent example is provided by an ED in Singapore, in which a triage tool, developed throughout a 1-year period, yielded a false-negative rate for SARS case identification of 0.28%. 46, 47 The CDC recommends that tissues and masks be made readily available for all symptomatic patients who enter the ED or hospital doors (to cover their mouths and noses) and that sinks or handwashing stations be accessible for all patients in waiting rooms and triage areas. 13 During periods of increased respiratory infections (eg, inf luenza season), separation of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in waiting rooms and triage areas is advised, and surgical masks should be distributed to all patients with active respiratory symptoms. When it is not feasible to set up separate waiting areas in the ED, symptomatic patients should be encouraged to sit at least 3 feet away from other patients in the waiting room. According to the CDC, this practice is supported by level IB evidence.",

In April 2003, SARS was added to the list of diseases for which quarantine is authorized (other diseases included are cholera, diphtheria, TB, plague, smallpox, yellow fever, and viral hemorrhagic fever). A lesson from SARS quarantines in Singapore is the capacity of a highly contagious infection to cause a rapid pandemic. The implications of quarantining a population or individuals for the length of the incubation time (or the length of the illness if patient is infected) are numerous. Quarantining a large population involves significant commitment of resources. To overcome the legal obstacles of a major quarantine, a plan must be in place well in advance of an outbreak. As part of the public health infrastructure, ED health care workers may be called on to participate in various infection containment strategies, including quarantining of individuals or vaccinating large segments of the population. OSHA One other important legal aspect relates to occupational safety. OSHA has a number of rules and regulations designed to protect the health and safety of health care workers. OSHA's jurisdiction includes all health care facilities. Health care workers in EDs should be aware that rules and regulations related to respiratory hygiene are legally mandated and must be implemented in hospitals in accordance with current guidelines, as described elsewhere.",

The effectiveness of ED air filtration techniques also remains unclear, and educational research in this area is required. The numerous ethical, legal, and practical challenges associated with isolation and quarantining of patients will also require further study, with emphasis on ED-specific questions such as the role of EDs in care of ''routine'' emergencies, development of ED surge capacity, and optimization of methods for coordination of EDs with the public health sector.",
