However, some concerns regarding the viability of smart technology applications must be addressed. This study investigated these concerns by reviewing the current practices of smart technology applications to mobile health care. As a result, five factors critical to the applicability of a smart technology to mobile health care are identified, and the fuzzy geometric mean-fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FGM-FAHP) approach is proposed to assess the relative importance levels of the identified factors. The experimental results showed that the three most critical factors identified include: (a) the relaxation of the related medical laws; (b) unobtrusiveness; and (c) the precise need and situation of a user. Accordingly, approximately 44%, 26%, and 15% of the budget should be allocated to the realization of the three critical factors, respectively. In addition, the challenges involved and opportunities for enhancing the effectiveness of existing applications are discussed.",

Today, smart technology applications have become more and more prevalent in mobile health care [ 2 , 3 ] . For example, Baek et al. [4] designed a smart diagnostic chair that could measure unconstrained heart rate and blood pressure without the direct contact between embedded instruments and bare skin of the users. According to the survey by Baig and Gholamhosseini [5] , no less than fifty smart health monitoring systems have since been invented at the time of their survey. These smart health monitoring systems automate patient monitoring tasks and facilitate workflow management. A smart surveillance system to detect abnormal motions of a user in emergency situations has been devised by Jung and Chung [6] . As noted by Natarajan et al. [7] , smart sensors adopted by a mobile health care system could be connected via an Internet of things (IoT), thereby facilitating the aggregation of various information sources to judge the health problem of a user accurately.",

These weights provide valuable information to manage activities on the realization of the critical factors under limited resources [16] . In addition, a judgment modification mechanism is also incorporated in the FGM-FAHP approach, so that an expert can modify his/her judgment subjectively if that deviates considerably from the consensus, which was not considered in [17] .

Over the years, the rapid proliferation of smart technological apps has resulted in several bundles of such apps trending towards new ways of delivering mobile health care services. In the past, apps and online social networks were disjointed ways to support mobile heath care [37] . Recently, a number of mobile health care apps have supported the forming of online social networks [38] . Some of these apps are based on the co-work of participants, while others are peer-led (i.e., led by people who have more experience or professional knowledge). In contrast, some apps for online social networking, such as Facebook and Line, have been applied to support mobile health care. People share health care related information and discuss with each other in such online social networks. In addition, rich multimedia, virtual reality, and augmented reality are also incorporated into a mobile health care app to provide vivid experiences of distant health care delivery [39] . In the past, it was pads or smart glasses that were usually adopted to support such functions [ 40 , 41 ] . However, advances in smart phone technologies and the several advantages of a smart phone (e.g., light weight, unobtrusiveness, etc.) have made it a more suitable alternative in recent years. Users with visual impairments usually rely on voice-based instructions. However, this is not possible in some situations such as meetings, crowded places, and noisy environments. To overcome this challenge, Porzi et al. [42] combined the use of a smart watch and a smart phone to develop a gesture recognition system for visual impaired users. When the smart watch detects a gesture made by the user, it will then transmit a signal to the smart phone to activate certain devices such as the screen or a camera. Where the camera is used to capture an image, the image could then be compared with several predefined images, representing certain risk, a specific location, or a facility. After that, the result is transmitted to the user via smart phone vibrations.",

The robot can deliver food or drinks, assist with cooking, and clean [45] . Instead of developing a more sophisticated service robot, Linner et al. [44] employed multiple cooperating service robots (i.e., a service robot system). Various types of service robots were selected to fit the layout and furniture of a room and to compensate for each other. Moreover, sensors were installed throughout the room to detect signals for activating these service robots. Advantages of applying robotic technologies to health care in serving as flexible physical assistant substitutes have been summarized in Linner et al. [44] .

First, using a smart phone actively or passively (e.g., hearing an alert without picking up the smart phone) affects the concentration of a user and may cause safety problems while walking, driving, or working [59] . It is even more difficult for people with low or impaired vision to use smart phones, which prevents them from using the related applications [42] . This difficulty can be resolved by providing them with screen readers or allowing them to give voice or gesture commands (with the aid of a smart watch) [42] . Even when a smart phone is used safely, detecting the location of the user by using the GPS module on his/her smart phone is subject to imprecision [29] , which affects the quality of inputs to a health care app. Existing health care apps are also subjected to several difficulties [60] . For example, answering numerous questions is not always convenient to a mobile user. To address this problem, a \"short-form\" survey is usually adopted to assess the functional health and well-being of a mobile user [59] . However, addressing all the concerns of a mobile user by applying this method is impossible. This leads to misjudgment by the system server [60] . Other problems include the breach of a user's confidentiality, the conflicts of interests, malfunction, the lack of business models, and privacy issues [33] .",

Then, he applied OWA to determine the clinic that was most suitable for the patient. However, the method was either too theoretical or not adequately efficient for real-time applications.

For example, the system server of a mobile health care system can be easily developed using a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) cloud service. The most notable benefit of using cloud computing is that the system administrator does not need to acquire, set up, or maintain the system software and hardware. Some cloud service providers such as Google Cloud can help develop system servers that support mobile apps. In addition, new techniques for balancing the loads on health care facilities and resources have been proposed in the recent years. Health care facilities and resources in a mobile health care system are recommended and allocated to users through the intervention of the system server, which attempts to balance the loads on health care facilities and resources to prevent them from congestion or underuse, thereby providing opportunities to improve their performance. For example, the average waiting time in a crowded clinic can be reduced, whereas the utilization of an infrequently visited clinic can be improved. In light of this, users' requirements can be more effectively mapped to the capabilities of clinics and hospitals.",

Identifying key factors and methods that can inform on the perceived applicability and practical innovativeness of smart technologies in mobile health care delivery are clearly some of the paramount steps in breaking down such difficulties. To this end, this study reviews the current practices of smart technologies to mobile health care. As a result, five critical factors were identified as unobtrusiveness, supporting online social networking, the relaxation of the related medical laws, the size of the health care market, and the correct identification of the need and situation of a user. Importantly, the FGM-FAHP approach is proposed to assess the relative importance of the identified critical factors. Compared with existing methods in this field, the FGM-FAHP approach is able to consider unequal experts' authority levels and incorporates a modification mechanism to enhance consistency.",
