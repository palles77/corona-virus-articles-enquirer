However, compliance rates with recommended hand hygiene practices in hospitals remain low. Previous literature on ways to improve hand hygiene practices has focused on the USA and Europe, whereas studies from developing countries are less common. In this study, we sought to identify common issues and potential strategies for improving hand hygiene practices in hospitals in China. We used a qualitative survey design based on in-depth interviews with 25 key hospital and public health staff in eight hospitals selected by the Chinese Ministry of Health. We found that hospital workers viewed hand hygiene as paramount to effective infection control and had adequate knowledge about proper hand hygiene practices. Despite these positive attitudes and adequate knowledge, critical challenges to improving rates of proper hand hygiene practices were identified. These included lack of needed resources, limited organisational authority of hospital infection control departments, and ineffective use of data monitoring and feedback to motivate improvements. Our study suggests that a pivotal issue for improving hand hygiene practice in China is providing infection control departments adequate attention, priority, and influence within the hospital, with a clear line of authority to senior management. Elevating the place of infection control on the hospital organisational chart and changing the paradigm of surveillance to continuous monitoring and effective data feedback are central to achieving improved hand hygiene practices and quality of care.",

Given the limited resources available in many hospital settings in developing countries, improving hand hygiene, while critical to reducing hospital-acquired infection rates, may be particularly challenging. 8 Specific barriers and hence potential strategies to change healthcare workers' behaviour regarding hand hygiene in resource-poor settings remain unclear.",

Improving hand hygiene practices globally is a priority of the World Health Organization, which recently highlighted the worldwide problem of insufficient hand hygiene practices in hospitals and the need for implementation of guidelines. 1 As a developing country, improving hand hygiene in China may be particularly challenging due to resource constraints. By conducting in-depth interviews of infection control directors and key staff, we sought to describe issues of adherence to current People's Republic of China's hand hygiene guidelines. We also aimed to describe potential ways of improving hand hygiene practices in the hospital from the perspectives of staff who had been involved with improvement efforts in infection control.",

Typically, infection control departments were managed by nurses or junior physicians, who were viewed as 'outside' the more powerful spheres of senior physicians and hospital management. Despite the participants' acknowledgement of the importance of having links to senior management, in many hospitals infection control directors did not report organisationally to hospital administration. Like hospital staff interviewed, several government officials also stated that infection control staff needed to have the authority to monitor and then follow up on problems with other staff in order to be effective. Without adequate senior level commitment to these goals, infection control functions were unlikely to be able to make any substantial improvements in practices.

Some participants noted that data on adherence to recommended hand hygiene processes which were known to improve outcomes (reduced HCAIs) would provide concrete targets for improvement. However, participants also said that monitoring of hand hygiene practices was not done routinely in any hospital. The focus was on bacterial counts on sampled hands of workers. Second, data were rarely actionable as they were produced from random checks and reported in unidentified ways months after the measurement. Subsequently, while the data could show trends in infection rates at the hospital, they were too generalised to foster quality improvement efforts on particular patient care units.

Monitoring of observed hand hygiene practices was not generally conducted, limiting the ability to provide timely data on the action needing improvement. Instruments exist to facilitate a simple process of observation and data feedback to staff on hand hygiene. 24 Using the principles of quality improvement, hospitals could set targets for hand hygiene practices, implement observation-based data monitoring, and provide feedback to staff about performance. Although such monitoring does require resources and attention, it can be far more effective than random checks of hand bacteria. If done in a non-punitive, learning environment, such data feedback can drive substantial and sustained improvements in healthcare worker practices.",

This was a qualitative, exploratory study in which we sought to understand in depth the reasons for inadequate hand hygiene practices in China.

In addition, although we ensured that the interviewer was fluent in Mandarin and was embedded in the hospitals to reduce misunderstandings and mistrust, participants may have withheld information. Given the types of responses received and the guaranteed anonymity, however, we believe that participants were forthcoming. Furthermore, the sample was relatively small, which is common with qualitative studies. 9 We did achieve theoretical saturation, suggesting that we obtained a comprehensive view of the issues. 9, 13 However, a broader sample with more diverse participants may have generated additional themes. Finally, this was a hypothesis-generated study about the possible causes of inadequate hand hygiene in hospitals. We did nonetheless employ several strategies recommended by experts to enhance the rigor and validity of qualitative studies, including the consistent use of a discussion guide, use of researchers from diverse disciplines to conduct the analysis, and sampling until the point of theoretical saturation. 9e14 Future research should test whether changes in these factors result in significant improvements in hand hygiene practices.",

Despite international engagement in improving hand hygiene, all countries struggle to sustain proper hand hygiene practices in healthcare. 1 Our study suggests that the core issues are about the degree to which the infection control department and its staff are given adequate attention, priority and influence within the hospital with a clear line of authority to senior management. Elevating the place of infection control on the hospital organisational chart and changing the paradigm of surveillance to continuous monitoring and effective data feedback are central to achieving improved hand hygiene practices and quality of care.",
