Therefore, it is assumed that in the oligomer the major helices are involved also in an inter-chain coiled-coil. Such a structure would resemble the complex coiled-coils found in the dimeric variable surface glycoproteins (VSG) of t'rypanosomes (Metcalf et al., 1987) and the haemagglutinin trimer (HA) of influenza virus (Wilson et al., 1981) . Tn these proteins, bundles of four (VSG) or three (HA) a-helices with lengths of 90 and 76 A, respectively, are surrounded by shorter helices; the interaction of the long helices stabilizes the oligomer. The influenza virus HA and the coronavirus peplomer are functionally analogous, both carrying the receptor binding site and mediating membrane fusion. We propose that, t'hese surface projections have converged to a similar super-secondary structure in order to position the receptor binding site at some distance from the membrane. Thus, the typical elongat.ed shape of the coronavirus peplomer may be explained by a model (Fig. 4) , in which a coiled-coil with a predicted length of 100 to 130 AA forms t,hr connection between the globular 1 Membrane Figure 4 .
