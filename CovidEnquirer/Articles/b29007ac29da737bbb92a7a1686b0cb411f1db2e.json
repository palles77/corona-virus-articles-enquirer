In some rabbits, thickened patches of skin can be associated with the variation in hair growth cycles. This is more common in young rabbits and becomes less obvious with increasing age. The mean thickness in these patches is 2 mm as compared with 1 mm in normal skin. Histologic examination of the patches reveals increased size of hair follicles and increased vascularity. Notable histologic differences include (1) the absence of epitrichial sweat glands in rodents and (2) the structure of the tail epithelium of the mouse and rat, which features orthokeratosis with a stratum granulosum at the follicular osia and parakeratosis without a stratum granulosum in the interfollicular areas.",

These findings may be interpreted as signs of skin disease by some owners. Gerbils have a yellowish tan, midventral scent gland, which is also sebaceous, more prominent in male animals, and occasionally mistaken as a cutaneous abnormality. Rabbits have a mental or chin gland (which is sebaceous in nature) with which they mark their territory, Normal ferrets typically have visible accumulations of brownish cerumen around the external auditory meatus.

In most cases, clinical signs are first noted in the spring. The initial abnormality is usually a bilaterally symmetric, noninflammatory alopecia that usually begins on the tail and tail base ( Fig. 21-4 ) and progresses to the ventral abdomen, caudomedial thighs, dorsal surface of hind paws, lumbosacral region, and shoulder blades. In some animals, the alopecia may come and go. In such cases, clinical signs appear in the spring and spontaneously regress in the autumn. However, clinical signs recur with increasing severity each spring and eventually persist.l? 17, 43 Most affected males and females have a strong musky odor. Vulvar enlargement is common in female animals , as is return to male sexual behavior in castrated males. In more chronic cases, the back of the neck, top of the head, and trunk become alopecic, and the body skin becomes thin and hypotonic ( Fig. 21-6 ). About 9% to 30% of affected ferrets are reported to have varying degrees of pruritus, mostly over the dorsum between the shoulder blades. 10, 43, 43a When present, pruritus is often severe and unresponsive to glucocorticoids and antihistamines. Numerous comedones are occasionally found on the tail, and phlebectasias may be seen.

The baseline plasma cortisol value in one affected hamster was elevated (approximately twofold increase) compared with that in one normal hamster. One hamster was treated with metyrapone (8 mg orally q24h for 1 month), and hair regrowth was complete after 12 weeks. A second hamster was treated with o,p'-DDD (5 mg orally q24h for 1 month), then metyrapone as described previously, and responded to neither drug. This hamster was euthanized, and a chromophobe adenoma of the hypophysis and bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasia were found at necropsy.",

            "text": "Pasteurellosis (snuffles) is the most common bacterial disease of the rabbit.\" Most rabbits carry Pasteurella multocida asymptomatically in the nasal cavity, and under conditions of stress, the bacteria multiply and cause disease. Subcutaneous abscesses develop as a result of septicemia, external wound contamination, or direct extension from deeper sties. The abscesses are variable in size, are usually firm on palpation, and are filled with a thick, white to tan exudate. Diagnosis is confirmed by microscopic examination of direct smears of exudate and culture. In the rabbit, subcutaneous abscesses are due to pasteurellosis until proven otherwise. Other causes of abscesses include S. aureus, Fusobacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus sp., and C. pyogenes.\" Abscesses on the head may be secondary to dental disease, a tooth root abscess, or an oral foreign body. 10 Abscesses in rabbits are typically filled with thick, caseated pus and are surrounded by a thick capsule. These two attributes make the use of drainage, drains, and topical and systemic antibiotics unsuccessful in most cases.v-10, 15 The treatment of choice is surgical excision and at least 2 weeks of antibiotic treatment (see Table 21 -1).10, 15, 81 If this is impossible, radical debridement, flushing, and antibiotics for several weeks may be effective.?\" In some rabbits, abscesses continue to recur in the same spot or at some other sites in an apparently healthy individual.'? Some of these rabbits may require lifetime antibiotic therapy to prevent recurrences. 10 Necrobacillosis (Schmorl's disease) is a sporadic bacterial infection of rabbits caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum. t It is characterized by inflammation, necrosis, ulceration, and abscessation, especially on the face, the head, and the neck. Diagnosis is confirmed by culture. Treatment is accomplished with surgical debridement, topical antimicrobial applications, and systemic penicillin or tetracycline administration. P. aeruginosa causes a localized moist dermatitis (sore dewlap) and, occasionally, subcutaneous abscess in areas of skin that are continuously wet. t The muzzle, the dewlap (see Fig. 21-12H) , the flank, and the haunches are most commonly involved. The affected skin is moist, erythematous, edematous, alopecic, and often ulcerated. The fur is often clumped, creating a spiked appearance. The most striking clinical feature is the blue-green color of the fur in animals with white fur, which is caused by a water-soluble pigment (pyocyanin) produced by the bacteria. Diagnosis is confirmed by microscopic examination of direct smears from oozing areas and culture. Treatment includes clipping, gentle cleaning, and application of astringents (aluminum acetate) and topical gentamicin sulfate ointment. Prevention is directed at removing the cause of continued wetness of the fur. The most common cause is the constant drooling (\"slobbers\") associated with dental disease.l\" Leaking water valves or water bottles should be replaced. Water bowls or pans should be replaced by water bottles with sipper tubes. Malocclusion of the teeth should be corrected to prevent drooling. Wet bedding should be changed more frequently. Ulcerative pododermatitis (sore hocks) is a common disorder in rabbits. \u00a7 Genetic predilection is important, as large body size and thinner plantar fur pads are important predtsposing factors. Unsanitary cage conditions, rough cage surfaces, and obesity also contribute to pressure necrosis and secondary bacterial infection with S. aureus. Lesions commonly occur unilaterally or bilaterally on the plantar aspect of the metatarsal region or, less commonly, the volar surface of the metacarpal area. Focal inflammation, oozing, crusts, and alopecia progress to ulcers, hemorrhage, and abscesses. In severe infections, the disease may extend to the bony structures of the foot and result in septicemia. Treatment includes correction of predisposing conditions, surgical drainage, topical antimicrobial applications, and systemic antibiotic administration (see Table 21 -1). Severe cases usually do not respond.",

In the northern hemisphere, most cases are seen from November to May, when heating systems often cause marked reductions in relative humidity. Some strains of rats seem more susceptible than others. The condition usually occurs after 2 months of reduced relative humidity. One or more annular constrictions develop in the tail, which becomes edematous, inflamed, and necrosed distal to the constrictions (Fig. 21-25 ). Ringtail is prevented by maintaining a relative humidity of at least 50%.",
