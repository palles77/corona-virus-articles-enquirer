Vitrification of the sample to obtain a dense distribution of particles within a single field of view remains a major bottleneck for the success of such experiments. Here, we describe a simple and cost-effective method to increase the density of frozen-hydrated particles on grids with holey carbon support films. It relies on performing multiple rounds of sample application and blotting prior to plunge freezing in liquid ethane. We show that this approach is generally applicable and significantly increases particle density for a range of samples, such as small protein complexes, viruses and filamentous assemblies. The method is versatile, easy to implement, minimizes sample requirements and can enable characterization of samples that would otherwise resist structural studies using single particle cryoEM.",

A solution of the particles under study is pipetted onto holey grids made of carbon-coated copper or gold (Quispe et al 2007; Russo et al 2014) . The holes in the grid support film become filled with particles suspended in buffer and the excess solution is blotted away using filter paper. The grid is then immediately plunged into a bath of liquid ethane, maintained at liquid nitrogen temperature (-180\u02daC) to vitrify the protein solution and preserve it in a near-native frozen-hydrated state (Dubochet 1988). Numerous specimens, however, are reluctant to populate the holes and remain adsorbed on the carbon support film instead, even after significantly increasing the sample concentration. Furthermore, many protein complexes are precious, due to the difficulty to purify them in large quantities, such that using higher concentrations is not an option.",

Although previous reports mentioned the possibility of multiple sample applications to increase particle density in suspended vitreous ice (Cheng et al. 2015) , this has never been described in detail to the best of our knowledge. We systematically tested this method on various samples and consistently observed that it greatly improved particle density in thin films of suspended vitreous ice, including cases in which ramping up the concentration failed to do so. We believe this procedure can benefit the exponentially growing numbers of single particle cryoEM practitioners who will inevitably run into samples that prove reluctant to evenly spread over holey cryoEM grids.",

We tested up to four blotting rounds and observed a marked additive effect of particle density at each step. All sample applications and blotting steps can be carried out on the lab bench, similarly to what is done for negative staining sample preparation, until the final sample application, at which point the tweezers are mounted in a plunge-freezing apparatus to perform the final blotting step using standard procedures. Alternatively, all rounds of sample application and blotting can be performed with the tweezers mounted in a plungefreezing apparatus, if desired. We used Whatman No. 1 filter paper, which is the only extra requirement over our standard grid preparation procedure. For all examples that follow, samples were vitrified using Protochips C-flat grids and imaged on an FEI T12 electron microscope equipped with a Gatan US4000 CCD camera, an FEI TF20 or an FEI Titan Krios, equipped with a Gatan K2 direct detector (Li et al. 2013) . We used MotionCorr2 (Zheng et al. 2016) for movie frame alignment and binned all images by a factor of 4 for visualization.",

At 1 mg/mL, the O3-33 solution yielded an optimal particle density for single particle cryoEM imaging. Diluting the sample five-or tenfold significantly reduced the distribution of particles over suspended ice. This effect could be partially overcome for both dilutions after a second round of sample application and blotting. After the fourth blotting step, the particle density in suspended vitreous ice became comparable to that observed with grids prepared with a single application of a ten times higher protein concentration. These results illustrate that the method can greatly alleviate sample requirements for single particle cryoEM, both in terms of protein concentration and total amount required.",

A single round of sample application and blotting of the MHV S ectodomain in the presence of 0.01% NP40 yielded few particles in suspended vitreous ice, even at concentrations up to 4 mg/mL. After the second round of blotting, many more particles could be observed in the ice. We would like to emphasize that in the absence of detergent, a single sample application resulted in a very dense distribution of particles, even at less than half the concentration. We obtained similar results with the HIV envelope glycoprotein ectodomain in the presence of 85 \u00b5M of dodecyl-\u03b2-D-maltoside (a sample known to be prone to aggregation upon vitrification, Lyumkis et al 2013). Although few particles were detected in vitreous ice after a single round of blotting, good particle density was achieved after the second sample application, thereby alleviating the need for large amount of protein ( Figure 6 ).",
