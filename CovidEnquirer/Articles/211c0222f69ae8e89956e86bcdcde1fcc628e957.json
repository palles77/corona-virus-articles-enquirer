At the genetic level, this virus was strictly related to the prototype strain CB/05, but displayed some unique features. After experimental infection with the new pantropic isolate, most inoculated dogs showed diarrhoea and acute lymphopenia. Gross lesions and histological changes were mainly evident in the gut and lymphoid tissues, although some animals showed remarkable changed also in parenchymatous organs. The viral RNA was detected in the faeces and/or internal organs of most pups. These findings seem to indicate that strain 450/07 is able to spread to internal organs (mainly lymphoid tissues), causing lymphopenia but inducing a mild disease. \u00df",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are large, enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses that cause respiratory and/or enteric disease in mammals and birds. In dogs, three coronaviruses have been described so far. Canine coronavirus (CCoV) type I (CCoV-I) and type II (CCoV-II) are enteric viruses belonging to the old antigenic group 1 Buonavoglia, 2008, 2011) , recently classified as a new genus Alphacoronavirus (Carstens, 2009 ). According to the new taxonomy, CCoVs are included in the same species, Alphacoronavirus-1, as feline and some swine coronaviruses (Carstens, 2009) . Canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), first reported in UK by Erles et al. (2003) , is a Betacoronavirus (Carstens, 2009 ) causing respiratory distress especially when associated to other pathogens (Buonavoglia and Martella, 2007; Decaro et al., 2007c) . CCoV-I and CCoV-II are widely distributed in Europe (Decaro et al., 2010b (Decaro et al., , 2011a and are usually responsible for mild to moderate gastroenteritis in pups, although death can occur as a consequence of simultaneous infections by both genotypes (Pratelli et al., 2004; Decaro et al., 2005) or by other pathogens (Decaro et al., 2004a (Decaro et al., , 2007a . CCoV infection is usually restricted to the gastroenteric tract, and associated with anorexia, diarrhoea and vomiting (Tennant et al., 1991) . However, in 2005 a fatal outbreak of CCoV-II infection was reported in pups housed in a pet shop of Apulia region, Italy . Coronavirus RNA (strain CB/05) was detected in the internal organs of the pups, presenting severe gross lesions, while other canine pathogens were not detected. Experimental infections of seronegative dogs reproduced the disease with the severity varying with the age of the infected animals . In addition, strain CB/05 was able to infect dogs with immunity to enteric CCoVs, causing both enteric and systemic signs, chiefly lymphopenia (Decaro et al., 2010a) . Subsequent experiments revealed that lymphopenia is the most prominent finding after infection by pantropic CCoV, with a marked long-lasting depletion of the circulating CD4+ T lymphocytes (Marinaro et al., 2010) . Upon genomic analysis, strain CB/05 showed a high degree of homology to reference CCoV strains (Decaro et al., 2007d) . Unique point mutations were present at the Nterminus of the spike (S) protein, including an Asp/His to Asn change at position 125. In addition, a unique 38nucleotide deletion was mapped within ORF3b.",

            "text": "In the present paper, we report the isolation of a novel pantropic CCoV strain from the lungs of a pup that died after systemic disease. The virus was characterised at the genetic level, displaying a close relatedness (more than 99% aa identity) to the prototype strain CB/05 in all the analysed proteins. Like strain CB/05, strain 450/07 displayed the unique mutation Asn-125 in the S protein, and the 38-nt deletion in ORF3b. These genetic signatures are not shared by all pantropic CCoV strains (Decaro et al., manuscript in preparation) . An additional 164-deletion, affecting the protein frame shift, was mapped in ORF3c. Coronavirus accessory protein genes are believed to be dispensable for replication in vitro, but they are strictly maintained during infection of the natural hosts . In both the pantropic CCoV strains CB/05 and 450/07, the accessory protein 3b was 49 aa shorter than expected. In strain 450/07 the ORF3c product was likely not expressed due to the presence of an early stop codon in the 5 0 end of the gene. Similar deletions in the accessory protein genes of feline coronavirus have been suggested to play a role in the enhanced virulence showed by the hypervirulent biotype feline infectious peritonitis virus (Haijema et al., 2007) . Enterotropic CCoV-II strains genetically related to CB/05 have been detected in recent years, but none of them displayed deletions in the accessory protein genes (Decaro et al., 2007d) . Thus, strain 450/07 may have originated from the prototype virus CB/ 05 through an additional 164-nt deletion in ORF3c.",

These apparent variations could be accounted for by differences in the breed and age of the infected dogs, in the dose and cell passage of the viruses used for the challenge and in the clinical score adopted to evaluate the induced disease. Variations in virulence have been observed in different challenge experiments using the same batch of CB/05 isolate Marinaro et al., 2010) . A comprehensive study using simultaneously both viruses would help evaluate more precisely if the two strains differ in their pathogenic potential.",
