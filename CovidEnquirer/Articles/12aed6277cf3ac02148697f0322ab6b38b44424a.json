No data are currently available that systematically describe ACE2 distribution and activity in rodents. Therefore, we analyzed the ACE2 expression in different tissues of mice and rats on mRNA (RNase protection assay) and protein levels (immunohistochemistry, ACE2 activity, western blot). Although ACE2 mRNA in both investigated species showed the highest expression in the ileum, the mouse organ exceeded rat ACE2, as also demonstrated in the kidney and colon. Corresponding to mRNA, ACE2 activity was highest in the ileum and mouse kidney but weak in the rat kidney, which was also confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Contrary to mRNA, we found weak activity in the lung of both species. Our data demonstrate a tissue-and species-specific pattern for ACE2 under physiological conditions.",

            "text": "In the regulation of heart function and blood pressure, different peptide systems are involved, e.g. the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), the kallikrein-kinin system, and the natriuretic peptide system. In these systems, proteases like angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) or neutral endopeptidase (NEP) have the distinction of generating or catabolizing biologically active peptides [10, 39, 42] . The newly discovered angiotensin-converting enzyme-related carboxypeptidase (ACE2) has considerable sequence homology to ACE (40% identity and 61% similarity), contains a HEXXH zinc-binding domain, and conserves other critical residues typical of the ACE family [12, 37] . The first step in generating angiotensin peptides is the cleavage of angiotensinogen to angiotensin (Ang) I by renin. Ang I is hydrolyzed by either ACE or chymase to Ang II, which mediates its biological actions via the AT1 and AT2 receptors [15, 21] . Ang I is also metabolized by NEP to Ang-(1-7) [15] , which mediates distinct effects through its receptor Mas [35] . Importantly, Ang-(1-7) can also be directly metabolized from Ang II by ACE2, whereas aminopeptidase A converts Ang II to Ang III [18] . ACE2 also hydrolyzes Ang I to Ang-(1-9), although there is no hydrolysis of Ang-(1-9), Ang-(1-7), and Ang- (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . Moreover, ACE2 hydrolysis is also specific for des-Arg [9] bradykinin and its shorter fragments, although it cleaves neither bradykinin nor bradykinin-(1-7) [40] . ACE2 mRNA is expressed in many tissues but shows a less ubiquitous profile than ACE. First studies in mice detected the highest expression in the ileum by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) [23] .",

Consequently, after its discovery in 2000, ACE2 became an enzyme of interest for scientific investigation of its impact in cardiovascular physiology and pathophysiology [11, 12, 37] . To elucidate some of its physiological functions we investigated the tissue distribution of mRNA and protein in a variety of tissues of C57Bl/6 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats. While we could see correlating patterns of mRNA and ACE2 activity in most of the examined tissues, we also found significant divergences between the investigated species. The huge difference between mRNA and protein levels in the lung may be due to shedding as demonstrated for ACE [4, 12, 32] . This shedding leads to an increased secretion of ACE2 and lowered its protein content in the lung by even high mRNA expression. The significant differences that we found between the species on ACE2 protein and mRNA levels in kidney could be explained by the varying interspecies regulation and expression of peptidases, as shown in the literature for NEP activity in rat and rabbit kidneys [14] .",

The first possibility is at least supported by our finding that significant differences in ACE2 expression patterns exist between the close relatives mouse and rat.",

ACE2 can generate Ang-(1-7) by cleaving the Cterminal amino acid from AngII [40] . ACE2 is also involved in another pathway leading to the generation of Ang-(1-7). It cleaves AngI to Ang-(1-9) [12] . Ang-(1-9) is then hydrolyzed by ACE to Ang-(1-7) . We demonstrated that Ang-(1-7) is an endogenous ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Mas [35] . mRNA of the GPCR Mas was found at high levels in testis and certain brain regions and at Fig. 5 . Immunohistochemical visualization of ACE2 positive cells. Sections of lungs (upper row) and kidneys (lower row) from mouse (left panel) and rat (right panel). In the lungs of both species alveolar macrophages and type 2 cells were stained positive. The tubulus epithelium in mouse kidney was stained positive, whereas in the rat kidney only weak staining was seen. moderate levels in kidney and heart [2, 3, 31] . It was shown that high concentrations of Ang-(1-7) were present in heart, kidney, and brain [5, 6, 8, 28] . In recent investigations, it was demonstrated that ACE2, Mas, and its endogenous ligand Ang-(1-7) are present in the same cells of the kidney [9] . As we recently postulated, this indicates a relevant impact of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis on blood pressure regulation and cardioprotection.",

However, there was a high incidence of sudden death in animals overexpressing ACE2. Electrophysiology revealed severe, progressive conduction and rhythm disturbances with sustained ventricular tachycardia that progressed to fibrillation and death [13] . While anti-arrhythmic actions were demonstrated for Ang-(1-7) in low concentra-tions (0.22 nM) by stimulating its own receptor, 100-fold higher concentrations of Ang-(1-7) lead to arrhythmias by stimulating the AT1 receptor [17, 19] . Therefore, the overexpression of ACE2 may lead to a high increase in the production of Ang-(1-7), turning its cardioprotective actions into effects causing arrhythmias by unspecific AT1 stimulation. In future studies, the actions of Ang-(1-7) and its concentrationdependency on ACE2 expression on heart rhythm have to be proven in in vivo experiments with AT1-and Mas-deficient animals.",
