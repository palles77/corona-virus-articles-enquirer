One day after admission to the hospital in Hong Kong, the boy was tested positive to influenza A (H1N1) virus, while testing negative to MERS-CoV. The similar suspected cases caused by influenza have been also Contents lists available at ScienceDirect journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/yjtbi reported from other countries (Nishiura et al., 2012) . Not only influenza but also many other respiratory viruses induce only nonspecific clinical signs and symptoms. Thus, it is difficult to selectively detect and differentially diagnose only MERS among imported cases with upper respiratory symptoms (e.g. by screening febrile individuals at an international border (Nishiura and Kamiya, 2011) ). Laboratory diagnosis such as PCR takes time and cost, and there would be a substantial number of suspected imported cases to be tested and isolated in hospital if we intend to test and intervene all suspected febrile individuals arriving from affected countries.",

Employing a Bayesian approach, and assuming that the incubation period distribution and the prior probability (or the population risks) of all suspected respiratory viruses are known, the model has permitted us to calculate the probability of MERS given a certain length of the incubation period. Nevertheless, it has been recognized as a core issue of infectious disease epidemiology that an infection event of non-sexual directly transmitted diseases is seldom directly observable (Clancy and O'Neill, 2008) . Thus, the exact length of the incubation period is seldom known for each individual case. Nevertheless, it is frequently the case that the time of illness onset is remembered among cases, and the time from immigration to illness onset among imported cases is readily available and can be useful for demonstrating the practical usefulness of the probabilistic model to assist clinical diagnosis.",

While that study aimed to estimate the incubation period distribution, the present study extends the model structure in the earlier study to predict the probability of MERS diagnosis. In particular, the present study focuses on the distinction between influenza and MERS.

Suppose that he or she traveled to country A (where MERS has spread) for k days. In the case of resident of country A, we may drop the data or assume that k-1. We consider two different patterns of spread in country A: (i) an endemic state (i.e. the risk of infection is in a stationary state) and (ii) an epidemic state. In the case of the latter, we assume that the epidemic of novel coronavirus is in an early stage with an approximately exponential growth of infections. The frequency of exposure among imported cases during their travel is assumed as proportional to the incidence in country A. The exponential growth rate of incidence is known to be characterized by the basic reproduction number R 0 and the mean generation time T g (Wallinga and Lipsitch, 2007) . If the generation time is exponentially distributed, the growth rate r is calculated as r \u00bc (R 0 \u00c01)/T g , while we have r \u00bcln(R 0 )/T g for a constant generation time (Wallinga and Lipsitch, 2007) . Given identical values of R 0 and T g , the exponential distribution is known to yield the largest value of r among all the possible distributions of the generation time, while a constant T g gives the smallest r (Roberts and Heesterbeek, 2007) .",

Let R 0 and T g of influenza be 1.5 and 3.0 days, respectively. According to recent studies, R 0 and T g of MERS are assumed as 0.6 and 10.7 days, respectively (Cauchemez et al., 2014; Breban et al., 2013) . Similarly, R 0 and T g of SARS are assumed as 3.0 and 7.0 days, respectively (Donnelly et al., 2003) .

For illustration, we assumed that the length of travel was k \u00bc5 days (which is consistent with the empirical best estimate (Cauchemez et al., 2014) ) and also that a prior probability for each disease was 0.50.

            "text": "For the exposition of our proposed method, we first compare MERS against influenza, using both continuous and discrete models (i.e. Eqs. (11) and (13)), and examine the possible time from immigration to illness onset as ranging from 0 to 10 days. As mentioned above, as an alternative to MERS during the early stages of pandemic, we also compare influenza against SARS. In both comparisons, we assume endemic and epidemic scenarios, and the latter is restricted to the early exponential growth phase. In the epidemic scenario, we use two different exponential growth rates, i.e., one assuming that the generation time is a constant, and the other assumes that the generation time follows an exponential distribution. As the sensitivity analysis, we compute the probability of influenza (in comparison with MERS) given the time from immigration to illness onset, by varying the length of travel (from 0 to 20 days), prior probability of influenza (from 0.1 to 0.9), and R 0 of MERS (from 0.6 to 3.0) (Cauchemez et al., 2013) . Fig. 2A shows the probability of influenza given the exact time from immigration to illness onset (computed by Eq. (11)). One minus the probability of influenza gives the posterior probability of MERS. Since the median incubation of influenza is 3.4 days shorter than that of the MERS, the probability of influenza is high if the cases develop the disease shortly after immigration. However, as time goes by since immigration, the probability of influenza lowers 50% at day 2, and the probability of MERS exceeds that of influenza thereafter. Exponential growth of cases during the travel yielded higher probability of influenza than the case of uniformly distributed risk, although the difference was hardly visible on day 3 since immigration and later. If the growth rate was much greater, the probability of infection shortly before immigration would be elevated, increasing the probability of influenza. A similar qualitative pattern was seen in the comparison between influenza and SARS (Fig. 2B) . In this comparison, the posterior probability of influenza again appeared to be greater than 50% given that a case develops illness within 2 days since immigration. Fig. 2C and D shows the average probability of influenza, as compared with MERS and SARS, respectively, given that the case developed a disease between day 0 and day t since immigration (computed by Eq. (13)). Although the prediction becomes crude as compared to those based on the exact length of time in Fig. 2A and B, it clearly indicates that the average posterior probability of influenza is greater than 70% as long as the case develops the disease within 2 days since immigration. The probability is gradually lowered thereafter eventually reaching to 50%, i.e., the prior probability. Again, comparison between influenza and SARS yielded very similar results to that between influenza and MERS. Fig. 3A -C examines the sensitivity of the posterior probability of influenza to the duration of travel, the prior probability of influenza and R 0 of MERS, respectively. Fig. 3D -F shows the corresponding results of the average probability of influenza using Eq. (13). As the duration of travel was extended, it appeared that the posterior probability of influenza decreased for the early days from immigration ( Fig. 3A and D) . Since the incubation period of influenza is short (on the order of a few days at most), the long travel indirectly increased the likelihood of MERS. Short travel (e.g. 1 day) led us to have the high probability of influenza for those developing illness within 2 days since immigration, because the distribution of time from immigration to illness onset becomes closer to the incubation period distribution.",

The results of using SARS data were similar to those obtained using MERS data, which were consistent with similar viral etiology and common clinical characteristics between two diseases (Assiri et al., 2013a; Guery et al., 2013; Cotten et al., 2013; de Wit et al., 2013) . Moreover, we have demonstrated that our approach to doubly interval censored data can correspond to common practical settings in which the exact length from immigration to illness onset is not known. Assuming that the risk of MERS is likely much smaller than 0.50, the illness onset within 2 days can be said to be strongly suggestive of influenza as compared to novel coronavirus infection. Nevertheless, this predictive statement is not applicable to suspected cases at high risk of MERS-CoV infection, such as those previously exposed to camels or other confirmed cases in household or hospital (Assiri et al., 2013b; Reusken et al., 2013a Reusken et al., , 2013b ); a high weight should be given to the prior probability of MERS among these cases.",

By doing so, we have theoretically shown that accounting for such delay mechanism is critical not only for quantifying the natural history (Nishiura and Inaba, 2011) , but also for utilizing and interpreting the observable information among imported cases. Moreover, the applicability of the model is not limited to imported cases. The proposed statistical framework is widely applicable to other settings in interpreting the observable epidemiological data: the most typical application may be the distinction between nosocomial and community infections in hospitals by using the time from hospitalization to illness onset among hospitalized cases with an infectious disease (Lessler et al., 2007 (Lessler et al., , 2010 Ejima et al., 2013) . The formulation on this subject is our ongoing research.",

As discussed in an earlier study (Nishiura et al., 2012) , it is vital to collect the information of the incubation period upon emergence of a novel infectious disease. It should also be emphasized that the viral etiological study is valuable to directly quantify q i based on empirical data, although such data may be only applicable to general travelers (and not the travelers with close contact with other MERS cases or animals (Nishiura et al., 2014) ). In addition, the present study identified that addressing censored information of exposure at an exporting country requires us to understand the transmission dynamics at a global scale (and not at the country level) (Lam et al., 2011) . Namely, at least, either the exponential growth rate of infection, or a combination of the estimates of R 0 and T g has to be derived from epidemiological data Nishiura, 2010) . If we have a disease with similar etiology and characteristics (e.g. SARS as a substitute of MERS), R 0 , T g and the incubation period of the substitute disease could complement the uncertainty by the time these estimates become available for the novel disease.",
