Since then, sporadic outbreaks with primary transmission through dromedary camels to humans and outbreaks in healthcare settings have shown that MERS-CoV continues to pose a threat to human health. Several serologic assays for MERS-CoV have been developed globally. We describe a collaborative study to investigate the comparability of serologic assays for MERS-CoV and assess any benefit associated with the introduction of a standard reference reagent for MERS-CoV serology. Our study findings indicate that, when possible, laboratories should use a testing algorithm including >2 tests to ensure correct diagnosis of MERS-CoV. We also demonstrate that the use of a reference reagent greatly improves the agreement between assays, enabling more consistent and therefore more meaningful comparisons between results.",

            "text": "S ince the emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 (1), more than 2,250 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO); approximately one third of these cases were fatal. A large proportion of MERS-CoV cases have been the result of human-to-human transmission in healthcare settings (2, 3) ; outbreaks have occurred in several countries, with the largest outbreaks seen in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and South Korea (4). Dromedary camels are the putative reservoir hosts for MERS-CoV; they experience no or mild symptoms upon infection (5) . Primary infection can occur from dromedary camels to humans, and new cases with evidence of camel contact continue to occur sporadically (6) . MERS-CoV is 1 of the 10 high-threat pathogens on the WHO Research and Development Blueprint (7) , a document that sets out a roadmap for research and development of diagnostics, preventive and therapeutic products for prevention, and early detection and response to these high-priority pathogens. The WHO roadmap for MERS-CoV lists several priority activities, including improved diagnostics and vaccines for humans and camels as well as basic and translational research (8) . Serologic assays are critical for the evaluation of the efficacy of new vaccines and patient treatment, as are diagnostic tools to confirm infections and perform serosurveillance. A variety of serologic assays have been developed globally, both commercially and in-house; however, there is no evidence supporting the quality of performance of these assays and their consistency with one another. Participants at the WHO intercountry meeting on MERS-CoV in Cairo, Egypt, June 20-22, 2013, recognized this issue as a public health priority and called for a study to compare currently available serologic assays (9) . Therefore, we assembled a panel of human serum or plasma and polyclonal antibodies to compare the performance of serologic assays for MERS-CoV. We invited participants to use their testing algorithms to diagnose each sample as if it were a real patient sample. The assays were evaluated for sensitivity and specificity. Pas et al. described in 2015 the impact that a single international standard would have on reducing interlaboratory variability for MERS-CoV diagnostics (albeit in this case for NAT assays) (10) . To this end, we included 2 samples in the panel as examples of potential WHO International Standard material, and we assessed their effectiveness in harmonization of the data from the participant laboratories.",

All laboratories correctly identified the negative samples in the panel, including those containing antibodies against other coronaviruses, implying good specificity of the assays. Laboratories reported the positive results correctly except for sample 14, which tested negative by all but 1 assay; however, these results demonstrated the importance of a testing algorithm. We observed 14 instances of a sample being incorrectly determined as negative or borderline/equivocal in a single test in a single laboratory (Table 3) . However, because each laboratory used a testing algorithm involving >1 method of analysis, all the samples with sporadic spurious results were correctly diagnosed as positive or negative; if they had used a single assay type, we would have found a higher proportion of incorrect results. The results for sample 14, which was a pool of serum samples from patients with confirmed MERS-CoV, highlight a lack of sensitivity in most of the assays in this study; further investigation would be needed to determine why the antibody titers in this pool were below the limit of detection in all but 1 assay targeting N protein. It is important to understand whether there is a specific window of time in which clinical samples for serology should be taken or whether some patients do not mount a detectable antibody response against the spike protein during infection. Such information may lead to further updates of WHO guidelines on laboratory testing for MERS-CoV. The raw titers reported from the laboratories performing quantitative assays varied greatly, for some samples >1,000-fold, between laboratories ( Table 3 ). The use of a reference material in the assays tightened the values from the laboratories for all the samples, enhanced comparability (Figure 3) , and reduced the GCV percentage between all laboratories (Table 4) , perhaps unsurprisingly, but the magnitude of reduction in GCV percentage was noteworthy. MERS-CoV is an example of an important emerging pathogen with potential to cause outbreaks; diagnostic tests for emerging pathogens are often developed during outbreaks without proper validation or calibration.",

As we continue to face emerging pathogens, which pose significant risks to human health, it is important to use the experience gained from studies such as this to improve our response to the next threat. Standardizing assays is a key issue when different groups around the world are working to develop and produce novel assays and vaccine products. The need for a standard for MERS-CoV serology was discussed and was widely supported at the WHO-International Vaccine Institute joint symposium for MERS-CoV vaccine development in Seoul, South Korea, June 26-27, 2018. Several potential vaccines are in development, and the immune response elicited, their efficacy, and correlates of protection must be assessed. The use of a reference such as WHO International Standards (16) will enable worldwide harmonization of assays and comparability of the results from different preclinical and clinical studies. Assessing the specificity and sensitivity of methods is crucial to improve our understanding of the use and limitations of serologic assays for emerging diseases for which we have little knowledge of disease progression, antibody profiles, and other key information that is available for other infectious diseases.
