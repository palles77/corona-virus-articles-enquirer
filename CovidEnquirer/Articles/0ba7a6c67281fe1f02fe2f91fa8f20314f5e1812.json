Immunity against the virus controls replication, although intermittent viral shedding can still take place in the seropositive immunocompetent person [2] . As replication of cytomegalovirus in the absence of an effective immune response is central to the pathogenesis of disease, complications are primarily seen in individuals whose immune system is immature or suppressed by drug treatment or coinfection with other pathogens [3] . Estimates of the coding capacity of HCMV range from 160 open reading frames (ORFs) to more than 200 ORFs [4] . Recent studies using MS to determine the viral proteome suggest that the number of viral proteins may be even greater than previous estimates [5] . Analysis of proteins from purified HCMV virion preparations has indicated that the particle contains significantly more viral proteins than the previously known 71 HCMV virion proteins. Twelve of the identified proteins were encoded by known viral ORFs previously not associated with virions, and 12 proteins were from novel viral ORFs [6] . Therefore, new protein markers including HCMV tegument and various cellular structural proteins, enzymes, and chaperones are now serving as biomarkers for HCMV infection and as possible drug targets.",

EBV is a ubiquitous member of the herpesvirus family that is associated with a variety of lymphomas and lymphoproliferative diseases [7] . It encodes a multitude of genes that drive proliferation or confer resistance to cell death [8] . Infection of human B lymphocytes with EBV induces proliferative B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Recently, proteomic profiles of three LCLs were analyzed comparatively at the early and the late passages of cell culture. The phosphoprotein stathmin was identified, and expression significantly decreased with immortalization of LCLs [9]. Stathmin is critically important not only for the formation of a normal mitotic spindle upon entry into mitosis but also for the regulation of the function of the mitotic spindle in the later stages of mitosis and for the timely exit from mitosis [9] . In another study using standard matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) methods, 20 EBNA2 target proteins were identified, 11 of which were c-myc dependent and therefore most probably associated with proliferation of the host cell [10]. These findings further stress the role of EBV viral proteins, namely EBNA and LMP, in disease pathogenesis. Interestingly, when EBV-infected cells were treated with the drug 5\u0408-azacytidine (AZC)-a demethylating agent that induces the expression of silenced genes, i.e., the p16 tumor suppressor gene-21 polypeptides were down-regulated, while 312 A.

In its wider sense, proteomics research also assesses protein activities, modifications and localization, and interactions of proteins in complexes. It relies heavily on technology since it needs to identify proteins and protein complexes in biological samples comprehensively and quantitatively with both high sensitivity and fidelity. Proteomics is a promising approach for the study of viruses. It allows a better understanding of disease processes and the development of new biomarkers for diagnosis and early detection of disease, and accelerates drug development. Areas of proteomics that are particularly promising include the determination of altered protein expression, not only at the whole-cell or tissue level, but also in subcellular structures and biological fluids; the development of novel biomarkers for diagnosis and early detection of disease; and the identification of new targets for therapeutics and the potential for accelerating drug development through more effective strategies to evaluate therapeutic effect and toxicity.",

The availability of the complete sequences of a number of viruses has provided a framework for identifying proteins encoded in these genomes using mass spectrometry (MS) . Applying proteomics to the study of viruses allows the characterization of subviral proteomes (e.g., secreted proteins, surface proteins, and immunogenic proteins), the comparative analysis of different stains or physiological states, the identification of proteins related to pathogenicity and host-pathogen interactions, and the evaluation of mechanisms of action of antiviral therapies.",

Often infections are not diagnosed until symptoms appear and, in several cases, this may be years or decades after the initial infection. The ability to diagnose infection or cancer before the appearance of symptoms would be of critical importance for effective treatment. Proteomic analysis of serum has been proposed as a means of diagnosing infectious disease and/or the early diagnosis of cancer. There have been some recent exciting findings in the proteomics of the host or pathogen, and the use of standard mass spectrometric technologies has enabled many physicians and scientists to examine more closely the pathological and biological questions that can only be answered using proteomic approaches. 14 showed increased expression. Many of the induced proteins were involved in energy metabolism, organization of cytoskeletal structures, protein synthesis, or cell viability [11] . Therefore, the effect of drugs that activate silenced tumor suppressor genes and their proteomic profile following treatment is of considerable interest.",

The clinical manifestations of HSV infections are varied, ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening illness in neonates and immunocompromised hosts [12, 13] . HSV-1 infection induces severe alterations of the host translational apparatus, including the phosphorylation of a few ribosomal proteins and the progressive association of several nonribosomal proteins to ribosomes [14] [15] [16] . Using a proteomics approach, it was shown that VP19C, VP26, and ICP27 associated with ribosomal proteins [17] . Specifically, immediate early ICP27 protein associated with the cellular translation initiation factor poly A binding protein (PABP), eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3), and eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) in infected cells, resulting in the stimulation of translation of certain viral mRNAs and inhibiting host mRNA translation [18] . Another study has shown that approximately 50 cellular and viral proteins associate with the HSV-1 ICP8 single-stranded DNAbinding protein, some of which belong to DNA repair and chromatin family members [19] , implying that HSV-1 infection results in control of host cellular DNA replication/repair and gene expression machineries.",

For instance, SARS is a new infectious disease that first emerged in the Guangdong province, China, in November 2002 [20] . A novel coronavirus was later identified in patients with SARS. The detection of the virus in these patients, its absence in healthy controls or other patients with atypical pneumonia, and the reproduction of a similar disease in a relevant animal model indicated that this coronavirus was the causative agent of SARS (SARS-CoV) [21] . Interestingly, the full genome sequence was determined within weeks of the identification of the virus, but the proteome and biomarkers associated with SARS are slowly forthcoming. In a recent study using a mass spectrometric decision tree classification algorithm, Kang et al. identified four biomarkers determined in the training set that could precisely detect 36 of 37 (sensitivity, 97.3%) acute SARS and 987 of 993 (specificity, 99.4%) non-SARS samples [22] . A reasonably complete proteomic analysis was also performed on four patients with SARS at different times of infection, and a total of 38 differential spots were selected for protein identification. Most of the proteins identified were acute phase proteins, and their presence represented the consequence of a serial cascade of inflammatory reactions initiated by SARS-CoV infection. Of significance was the level of plasma peroxiredoxin II in patients with SARS, which was significantly higher in SARS patients and could be secreted by T cells [23] . Finally, while pursuing new enzyme targets, another study identified 14 putative ORFs, 12 of which were predicted to be expressed from a nested set of eight subgenomic mRNAs. Distant homologs of cellular RNA processing enzymes were identified in group 2 coronaviruses, with four of them being conserved in SARS-CoV. These newly recognized viral enzymes put the mechanism of coronavirus RNA synthesis in a completely new perspective, which has opened the door for new drug targets for the treatment of SARS [24] .",

            "text": "The proteomes of three other RNA viruses including HCV, HBV, and HIV-1 have also been studied. Hepatitis C often progresses to chronic infection in the majority of patients and is an emerging cause of viral hepatitis. Clinically, the infection is generally asymptomatic, but may present with a wide variety of symptoms. Cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cryoglobulinemia, autoantibodies, and glomerulonephritis have been strongly associated with HCV infection [25] . When analyzing proteins that interacted with the HCV protein NS5A, Choi et al. found that the cytoplasmic heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) bound to NS5A was concentrated in the ER [26] , where drugs for HCV treatment would have easy access (as opposed to drugs delivered into the nucleus). Chronic infection with HBV is associated with the majority of HCC. Using woodchucks as a model system, HCC induced dramatically higher levels of serum-associated core alpha-1,6-linked fucose, as compared with woodchucks without HCC. The coupling of this model system with 2D gel electrophoresis has permitted the identification of several glycoproteins with altered glycosylation as correlated to cancer prognosis. One such glycoprotein, the golgi protein 73 (GP73), was found to be elevated and hyperfucosylated in animals with HCC [27] . Finally, in an effort to identify useful biomarkers for HBV-or HCV-associated HCC, 60 proteins were identified which exhibited significant changes in expression between nontumorous and tumorous tissues. Among these, 14 proteins were commonly changed in all three of the HCC types, but 46 proteins showed a tendency toward viral marker specificity, suggesting that the pathogenic mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis may be different according to the viral etiology of HBV or HCV [28] .",

Therefore, defining biomarkers in coinfections after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is currently the focus of many laboratories. HIV accelerates HCV liver disease especially with the progression of HIV-associated immunodeficiency. With the introduction of pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin, greatly improved treatment options for patients coinfected with HIV and HCV have become available and have led to sustained virological response rates of up to 40% [30] . Furthermore, recent cohort analyses have shown that immune reconstitution induced by HAART can improve the course of hepatitis C infection leading to a decline in liver-related mortality. However, patients with HCV coinfection are at increased risk of hepatotoxicity from HAART [29] . Owing to the high rates of HIV and HCV coinfections worldwide, new improved biomarkers and treatment strategies and guidelines for the management of coinfection remain a major goal. Biomarkers could include protein fingerprints of HIV-1-infected human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) after viral infection, as well as HCV-infected liver cells. Recently, 58 proteins have already been identified to be up-or down-regulated after HIV-1 infection [31] .",

Proteins in the second pool were analogously cleaved with the carboxyl termini of the resulting peptides containing two 16 O atoms (i.e., no labeling). The method was used to compare two virus strains, adenovirus types 2 and 5. This shotgun approach for proteomic studies with quantitative capability may be a very powerful tool for comparative proteomic studies of very complex protein mixtures [37] . Finally, the isotope-coded affinity tag (ICAT) procedure has also yielded some very interesting results for a rather complex viral infection setting.

The viral particle consists of a lipid envelope, in which are embedded viral glycoproteins important for infection of target cells. The envelope surrounds an amorphous proteinaceous structure called the tegument [42] . The tegument is often composed of viral proteins critical for the initiation of viral gene expression, for example the VP16 protein of HSV [43] , as well as other viral and cellular proteins whose functions are unknown. The tegument surrounds the viral capsid, which is composed of a major capsid protein, one or more minor capsid proteins, and viral DNA. Identification of tegument and capsid proteins can be differentiated from the envelope glycoproteins by their differential sensitivity to trypsin and detergents. The tegument and capsid proteins are resistant to trypsin digestion in the absence of detergents. The envelope glycoproteins, however, are sensitive to trypsin digestion whether or not detergents are present. However, only the surface-exposed portions of glycoproteins are sensitive to trypsin in the absence of detergents.",

They then used ion trap MS to identify three additional components of the virion as ORFs 62, 26, and 65. This study, however, was limited and unable to identify all components of the infectious virus. Zhu et al. used a more comprehensive approach to identify virion components. Extracellular virions were purified by double gradient centrifugation. SDS-PAGE revealed 30-40 protein bands whose identity was determined by in-gel trypsin digestion, followed by LC and MS. Both peptide masses and peptide sequences were produced by tandem MS (MS/MS) and used to determine protein identity. The isolated proteins included five capsid proteins, eight glycoproteins, six tegument proteins, and five other KSHV ORFs. Twenty cellular proteins were also identified and, as seen with HCMV, these included cytoskeletal proteins, signal transduction proteins, as well as heat shock proteins [45] . Similar results were seen in the study by Bechtel et al. [40] . However, fewer proteins were identified in this study as a single 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel was used to separate virion proteins. Zhu et al.

However, EBV is the causative agent for Burkitt's lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma and is involved in a number of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated lymphomas. EBV can induce immortalization of B cells in vitro to generate lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), a model for the carcinogenic potential of EBV. LCLs are latently infected with EBV; they maintain the virus as an extrachromosomal episome, and have limited viral gene expression. The latently expressed proteins are the six EBV nuclear antigens (EBNAs 1, 2, 3A, 3B, 3C, and -LP) and three latent membrane proteins (LMPs 1, 2A, and 2B). Of the latently expressed proteins, EBNA2 and LMP are required for transformation induced by EBV [46] . Characterizations of cellular proteins associated with EBNA2 or proteins differentially expressed in the early stages of the transformation process will be described in the following text. Results of these studies may lead to a better understanding of EBV-mediated transformation and the identification of cellular targets for therapy.",

Furthermore, there is limited information on the cellular targets of EBNA2. To identify the EBNA2induced changes as c-myc dependent and c-myc independent, EBNA2 and c-mycconditionally expressing cell lines were used and the proteome of each cell line was compared [10] . Proteins were separated by 2D SDS-PAGE and identified by MALDI-TOF MS. In EBNA2 expressing cells, there were 20 differentially expressed proteins; 12 were induced and 8 were repressed. Of the proteins that were induced following EBNA2 expression, several were involved in nucleotide metabolism, protein synthesis, or the control of apoptosis. Many of these proteins were also induced in c-myc expressing cells, though six proteins were found to be EBNA2 specific. Two EBNA2-specific proteins were induced (Bid and IgE-HRF) and four were repressed (Annexin IV, \u2425-actin, GMF\u2425, and AF103803). Furthermore, analysis of the activation kinetics demonstrated that expression of EBNA2 preceded that of c-myc, which was then followed by the expression of Nm23-H1 (a nucleotide diphosphate kinase that may suppress metastasis [52] ), indicating that c-myc was a direct target of EBNA2 [10] .",

These virally expressed proteins do not function in isolation but associate with a variety of cellular and viral proteins. Furthermore, many have exhibited multiple different functions.

To identify the changes in ribosomes following HSV infection, ribosomes were purified by ultracentrifugation, the proteins were separated by 2D SDS-PAGE, and their identities were determined by MALDI-TOF MS. Seven additional protein spots were found associated with ribosomes following HSV infection, including several viral proteins: VP19C and VP26components of the viral capsid, and US11-a tegument protein. Three of the seven spots were phosphorylated forms of US11. One nonribosomal protein, PABP, was also found associated with ribosomes. The association of PABP with ribosomes increased following HSV infection [17] . Interestingly, PABP was also found associated with ICP27 in the previous study [18] . Although Greco et al. [17] did not find ICP27 associated with ribosomes, this is likely due to the different separation procedures used. Greco et al. [17] used 2DE and focused solely on basic proteins with a pI greater than 8.6 while Fontaine-Rodriguez et al. [18] separated isolated proteins based on molecular weight. Together, these results suggest that ICP27 likely associates with ribosomes in infected cells. Herpesvirus DNA replication occurs in intranuclear structures called replication compartments [54, 55] . HSV encodes seven proteins that participate in viral DNA replication; however, it is not known what cellular proteins are involved in this process. To identify cellular proteins in HSV replication compartments, ICP8, the HSV single-stranded DNA-binding protein, was immunoprecipitated from infected cells and coprecipitating proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and identified by ion trap MS [19] . Greater than 50 viral and cellular proteins were identified as copurifying with ICP8. The cellular proteins included those that participate in DNA replication/repair/recombination, chromatin remodeling, RNA binding/splicing, and transcription factors. Several of these proteins require DNA binding to associate with ICP8, including several chromatin-remodeling proteins. The roles of a number of interacting cellular proteins are presently unclear and further studies are needed to determine their exact roles in viral DNA replication.",

However, it has been shown that the viral genome is bound by nucleosomes that inhibit viral gene expression [58, 59] . To determine if Tat interacts with additional cellular proteins to further assist viral gene expression, we used Tat peptides linked to biotin to pull down all Tat-associated proteins [60] . Additionally, acetylated and unmodified peptides were also used because acetylation of Tat has been attributed to alternative functions of Tat [61, 62] . We found that many more cellular proteins bound to the unmodified Tat, including proteins involved in modification of chromatin structure (CHD2 and p/CAF) and additional transcription factors (TIF1-a TRIM family member-and SCL-a bHLH transcription factor) [60] . These results indicate that Tat influences viral gene expression at various levels and suggests that targeting these specific interactions may be a viable form of treatment of HIV infection and AIDS.",

            "text": "HIV infects several cell types during the course of infection and progression to AIDS. In HIV-infected patients, the virus establishes a persistent infection in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. Monocytes and macrophages are the first line of defense in the immune system: they phagocytose and kill a range of microorganisms. However, little is know about how HIV persists in these cells. To understand how HIV may persist in these cells, Carlson et al. [31] used a \"ProteinChip\" and SELDI to identify unique protein signatures in HIV-infected monocytes obtained from different donors. Infection of monocytes isolated from humans was used to mimic the virus-host interactions that would occur in an infected individual. The ProteinChips used in the study were used to partially purify samples. One is a weak cation exchange, and the second is a reverse-phase hydrophobic interaction chip. Charged proteins will bind to the cation ion-exchange chip while hydrophobic, i.e., membrane-associated, proteins will bind to the reverse-phase chip. Proteins bound to the chip were then analyzed by MS. Each peak represents a protein of a particular mass; however, the nature of the protein in a peak after SELDI MS is unknown. A different, separation technology and MS are needed to determine protein identities. To determine the identities of proteins up-or down-regulated following HIV infection of monocytes, total protein extracts were subjected to trypsin digestion, LC, and tandem MS to determine sequences of tryptic peptides. Sequences were then analyzed against a Protein Bank to determine the identities of the proteins and given a score [31] . The problem with this type of study is that there is no quantitative assessment of the increase or decrease in the protein levels or changes in posttranslational modifications (PTM) following infection.",

There is significant neuronal loss but neurons are not infected with HIV [64] . It has been hypothesized that HIV-infected astrocytes are critical in the development of HIV dementia, and that Tat is a contributor to this disease. Extracellular Tat released from astrocytes induces cell death in neurons, though Tat protects astrocytes from cell death [65] . To understand this dichotomy, proteins differentially expressed in Tat-expressing astrocytes were identified [66] . Total protein extracts of Tat-expressing and control cells were separated by 2D gel electrophoresis and identified by MALDI MS. Interestingly, seven proteins were found to be repressed in Tat astrocytes, including Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor. Many of these proteins have been shown to be involved in the biology of HIV and interact with Tat [66] . Three proteins identified by a slot blot technique were found to be induced, and included HSP70, heme oxygenase, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) [66] . Previously published data have demonstrated a correlation between iNOS and the severity of HAD [67, 68] ; however, the role of the other differentially expressed proteins in astrocyte survival and HIV dementia will require further study.",

Many protein-protein interactions of Tax have been determined by mutational analysis including CREB [70] [71] [72] and NF-B [70, 72] . To identify all the cellular proteins that interact with Tax, Wu et al. used chromatography, 2D gel electrophoresis, and mass spectrometric analysis of an HTLV-1-infected cell line (C81) [73] . As Tax functions in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus [70, 74] , Tax-interacting proteins were identified from both cellular compartments. Some of the cytoplasmic proteins included small GTPases and components of the cytoskeleton while some of the more interesting nuclear proteins included components of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex [73] .

NS5A has been proposed to act as a cofactor in HCV replication [89] , as a transcription activator [90] , or as an anti-apoptotic factor [91] . To identify the cellular proteins that interacted with NS5A, Choi et al. [26] coimmunoprecipitated NS5A-interacting proteins using antisera against NS5A, separated them via 2D gel electrophoresis, and determined their identity by MS. One cellular protein was found to interact specifically with NS5a, the heat shock protein (HSP) 27, also known as SRP27. Further analysis indicated that HSP27 interacted with the C-terminal domain of NS5A and both proteins were shown to colocalize around the nucleus. The HSPs are induced following cellular stress to protect cells from apoptosis [92] ; yet, overexpression of HSP27 did not protect cells from HCV core-induced apoptosis. As HSP27 expression could not be reduced by siRNA, the role of HSP27 in HCV RNA replication could not be determined. However, due to the multifunctional nature of NS5A, it is surprising that only one protein was found to interact with NS5A. Because an antibody to NS5A was used to coimmunoprecipitate cellular proteins, the antibody used in the study may be interfering with the binding of other cellular proteins. This problem may be overcome by using different antibodies to NS5A or by using a tagged NS5A and affinity chromatography.",

The resulting gel can be stained with a variety of protein dyes to reveal a pattern of spots. In the first dimension, isoelectric focusing (IEF) is performed by using IPG strips which are based on the use of bifunctional immobiline reagents, a series of 10 chemically well-defined acrylamide derivatives that copolymerize with the acrylamide matrix, to generate extremely stable pH gradients forming a series of buffers with different pK values between 1 and 13. Subsequently, linear or nonlinear wide (IPG 3-12), medium (IPG 4-7), narrow (IPG 4.5-5.5), and ultra-narrow (IPG 4.9-5.3) pH range IPGs can be cast [95] . We suggest the reader to refer to the review by Gorg et al. for more details about IPG strip rehydration, sample application, and IPG strip equilibration [96] . The second dimension consists of using SDS-PAGE to separate proteins according to their molecular weight. However, the analysis of low-molecular-weight (\u03fd15 kDa) and high-molecular-weight (\u03fe150 kDa) proteins is challenging since there is no standard 2DE system that effectively allows separation of proteins over the entire range between 5 and 500 kDa. A common approach is to combine several gels optimized for different molecular weight ranges instead of using a single standard 2DE system. ",

In several studies, proteins expressed at different levels among diseased individuals as compared to those of healthy ones were identified as markers for disease progression as well as proteins with different N-glycosylation patterns [99] [100] [101] .

In addition, 2DE produces a map of intact proteins, which reflects changes in protein expression level, different isoforms, or PTM. In fact, a great advantage of this methodology is its capability to study proteins that have undergone some form of PTM (such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, or limited proteolysis) that can be detected visually on the 2DE gels as they appear as distinct spot trains in the horizontal and/or vertical axis of the 2DE gel. This is in contrast with other methods, including LC-based methods, which perform analysis on peptides, where molecular weight and pI information is lost, and stable isotope labeling is required for quantitative analysis [96] .",

These include issues with reproducibility, as well as the inability to separate hydrophobic proteins, which are poorly soluble. Although the use of IPG strips increases the reproducibility of 2DE, various problems with 2D separation remain such as streaking, poor focusing, and the variable occurrence of gaps [85] . Although 2DE allows for high resolution of individual spots, a single spot may not correspond to a single protein, since proteins can comigrate as a single spot on a 2D gel [102] . Furthermore, 2DE requires milligram quantities of protein, reflecting the low sensitivity of this method. To further enhance the utility of 2DE-MS, enrichment of samples for low-abundance proteins by improved methods is required. Enrichment can include prefractionation of samples, as well as more sensitive detection and quantitation methods, or the use of alternative methods including laser capture microdissection [103] for heterogeneous tissues. In most of the studies mentioned previously, the resolution problem was overcome by narrowing the pH range allowing for greater focusing. However, the reduced pH range in IEF can lead to the elimination of a large number of proteins that may be informative. Comparing hundreds of protein spots across gel images taken from a large number of different samples is extremely time-consuming, even with specialized software. For this reason, although 2D electrophoresis is a promising tool, it is not very practical for clinical application. The challenge is to develop this technique into a system capable of automation, high throughput, and high sensitivity.",

Peptides are then analyzed by tandem MS consisting of two phases. In the first phase, peptides in each chromatographic fraction are electrosprayed and ionized producing a mass spectrum characteristic of the molecular weight of each peptide in the sample. In the second phase, the first mass analyzer of the instrument is used to select a single (M \u03e9 H) \u03e9 ion from the mixture and to transmit it to a collision chamber, where the peptide undergoes collisions with argon atoms and suffers fragmentation. The resulting fragment ions are then transferred to a second analyzer, which separates them according to mass [104] . The end result is a mass spectrum containing ions characteristic of the sequence of amino acids in the selected peptide. When mixtures are extremely complex, online reverse-phase LC is used to concentrate and separate the peptides before sequencing by MS [105] . An online capillary LC/MS/MS system consists of conventional HPLC pumps, transfer tubing, a precolumn flow splitter, a liquid junction, a reverse-phase microcapillary column, and a tandem mass spectrometer [106] .",

The second study used normal hepatocytes and immortalized human hepatocytes that can be induced to express the entire HCV ORF. The two different cell types were labeled with an isotopically light ( 12 C for stimulated) or heavy ( 13 C, for control cells) reagent called isotope-coded affinity tag (ICAT); the two differentially labeled samples were then combined and digested with trypsin. Digested peptides were separated by strong cation-exchange chromatography, affinity purified with an avidin cartridge, and subjected to LC-ESI-MS/MS.

SARS is a viral respiratory illness caused by SARS-CoV. SARS was recognized as a global threat in March 2003, after first appearing in Southern China in November 2002 (http://www.cdc.gov; [20] ). Current serological methods used for laboratory diagnosis of SARS fail to guarantee early diagnosis since most are based on the detection of antibodies that are produced 17-20 days after the onset of symptoms. ELISA-based antigen detection tests offer high specificity and reproducibility, but they lack sensitivity. On the contrary, PCR-based methods, including reverse transcription-PCR, lack sensitivity and specificity [112] . For this reason, there is a need to develop a diagnostic methodology that can detect SARS before the onset of the symptoms to allow for specific prevention and treatment measures for SARS. According to recent studies, SELDI-TOF seems to be a promising approach to study the protein profile unique for SARS. Sera from acute SARS patients or from healthy donors were examined to identify serum marker that could distinguish SARS from non-SARS patients. In this study, analysis of spectra accurately classified 36 of 37 (97.3%) SARS specimens and accurately classified 987 of 993 (99.4%) of the controls as non-SARS. In addition, the classification algorithm successfully distinguished acute SARS from other type of infections with very high precision [22] . The same approach was also employed for the discovery of diagnostic proteomic signatures in the sera of patients with CHB having liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Results show that 30 serum proteomic features formed a unique fingerprint for fibrosis that correlated with the different stages of fibrosis from minimal fibrosis to cirrhosis [66] .",

Originally most studies have relied on the analysis of the interaction of two proteins or used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify new protein partners of a protein of interest. These studies, however, are quite labor intensive. Furthermore, the yeast two-hybrid system is susceptible to false-positive identifications, cannot be used to identify multiprotein complexes, and typically does not take into account possible PTM that may influence protein binding. Proteomic analysis, however, can be used to identify multiprotein complexes and, when used in the analysis of infected cells, will take into account any PTM that occur in infected cells. Proteomic analysis of infected cells has resulted in the identification of cellular proteins that may mediate HSV IC27-induced repression of cellular protein synthesis [18] , and the identification of over 50 cellular and viral proteins in HSV DNA replication [19] . Furthermore, analysis of the HIV Tat and HTLV Tax proteomes identified members of chromatin remodeling complexes as components of these viral transactivator multiprotein complexes [60, 73] . Many of these studies will allow for further understanding of virus transcription, replication, and transformation. Additionally, these studies may lead to the identification of unique drug targets. For example, the p-TEFb complex has been shown to be critical for HIV gene expression [56, 60, 116] and HIV-infected cells are uniquely sensitive to the transcription suppressing effects of the p-TEFb inhibitor flavopiridol [116] [117] [118] .",

Studies have been performed on patients infected with SARS-CoV, HIV, HCV, HBV, and HIV-1 using a variety of approaches. Some of the methods that have been used are 2D-PAGE followed by MS, LC/MS/MS, SELDI ProteinChips, and protein microarrays. These methods have their advantages and disadvantages. 2D gel electrophoresis allows for resolution of greater than 1000 protein species, can be used for quantitative analysis of expression, and reflects changes in PTM and the identification of isoforms. However, several issues with 2D gel electrophoresis are its lack of reproducibility, the difficulty in detecting hydrophobic proteins, low sensitivity, and the inability to use a high-throughput method to analyze a large number of samples. LC-MS has the advantages of solubilization of the majority of proteins, automation, ability to switch columns, and sensitivity; however, the ability to quantify changes in protein levels is lost with LC-MS.",

To ensure the specificity of peak profile for a particular disease state, a robust algorithm is needed. Lastly, protein microarrays have been developed to determine the immune response to a viral infection. The method requires the expression and printing of all ORFs of a pathogen and cross-linking them to a solid support. Protein microarrays would allow for the rapid diagnosis of a particular viral infection. However, expression of a complete proteome is a challenging task.

The abundance of these proteins means that analysis of serum for potential biomarkers of disease requires either very sensitive methods or separation of albumin and Ig from serum. Several albumin and/or Ig depletion methods have been developed to resolve this issue. Pieper et al. [120] developed a series of chromatographic columns to separate immunoglobulins based on their affinity for proteins A and G as well as columns containing antibodies with specificities for individual proteins such as albumin, fibrinogen, and transferrin. The columns were successful in depleting serum samples of their respective proteins, and use of several columns significantly decreased the complexity of the sample analyzed [120] . Additionally, a mixed-bed column was developed that allowed the simultaneous separation of several proteins, which would allow for automated processing of samples. A similar approach has been developed by Bio-Rad (Affi-Gel Blue) to deplete samples of albumin, enhancing the detection of other proteins in the sample [121] . Affi-Gel Blue has affinity for hydrophobic, aromatic, or sterically active binding sites of protein. Although this product has high affinity for albumin, it may bind other proteins as well, limiting its usefulness. Lastly, Baussant et al. [122] developed a peptide-based approach to deplete albumin. Their approach was based on the fact that although protein G has affinity for the Fc region of IgG, it can also bind albumin less specifically. Baussant et al. modified a peptide of protein G to have a much higher affinity for albumin, which significantly and specifically depleted the serum of albumin; however, other hydrophobic proteins, i.e., apolipoproteins, were also captured [122] .",

The goals of such analysis steps include accurate protein detection and quantification, consistent comparative visualization methods, as well as the identification of differentially expressed proteins between samples run on different gels. To achieve these goals, systematic errors such as geometric distortions between the gels must be corrected by using computer-assisted methods.

Several studies have provided evidence that ProteinChip technology is capable of detecting early-stage cancer by its unique cancer-specific proteomic fingerprints, with sensitivities and specificities reaching far beyond well-established serumbased tumor markers [123] . However, as in most rapid diagnosis tests, SELDI technology can still not detect the nature of the amino acid biomarkers or their PTM in a consistent and reproducible manner.

Although in some cases investigators have found new enzyme targets as markers (i.e., SARS-CoV), no serious attempts have been made to functionally identify their significance in the pathology of the virus. This is mainly because the field of viral proteomics is at its early stages of development and much confirmatory information would be required from animal or human model studies, which are currently either in progress or will need to be developed in near future.

However, in most cases the removal of these proteins may in fact compromise the detection of biomarkers or their partners, since in many instances, viral infection leads to overexpression of the most abundant proteins such as the actins, keratins, tubulins, cyclophilins, vimentin, and HSPs among others. Therefore, future attempts at the identification of biomarkers would have to define not only the most high-and lowabundance proteins but also their partners and possible modifications.",
