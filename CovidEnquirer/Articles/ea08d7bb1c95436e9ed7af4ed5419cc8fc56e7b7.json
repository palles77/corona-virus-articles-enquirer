            "text": "of susceptible canine population could prevent rabies transmission among canines [3] , but this faces technical and logistic challenges [4] . Canines require annual rabies vaccination from 3 months of age, and often do not develop adequate protective immunity due to poor immunogenicity of the vaccines used, or co-existent malnutrition and diseases. Huge numbers and rapid turnover of free-roaming canines and difficulties in retrieving them for booster vaccinations introduce additional layers of complexity into canine vaccination programmes in the developing countries. Clearly, potent, inexpensive vaccines and efficient mass vaccination strategies are needs of the hour in canine rabies control in the rabies-endemic countries.",

A eukaryotic expression vector encoding full-length glycoprotein gene of rabies virus represents the simplest design of an anti-rabies vaccine, capable of generating protective neutralizing antibodies upon in vivo delivery. Such constructs have been shown to mediate efficient prophylaxis in small animal models, but are observed to be poorly immunogenic in larger animals ( [5] , and references therein). In general, systemic lability, poor cellular uptake and low immunogenicity remain major hurdles limiting the utility of plasmids for in vivo applications [6] . Attempts to improve plasmid-based vaccination are currently focused on improved vector design, gene modifications and the use of efficient delivery vehicles and molecular adjuvants [7, 8] .",

Briefly, the gene fragment was PCR amplified using MydFor (AT-TATCTACAATGGCTGCAGGAGGTCCC) and MydRev primers (TAAAGTCGACTCAGGGCAGGGACAAGGC) (bearing XbaI and SalI sites, respectively), using pFLAG-CMV4-hMyd88 as template. The reaction was set up in a volume of 50 \u00b5L, employing 10 pmol each of MydFor and MydRev, 2.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase and 250 ng of the template. The amplification conditions were as follows: denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 1 minute, followed by 35 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 68\u00b0C for 30 seconds and 72\u00b0C for 45 seconds, and final extension at 72\u00b0C for 3 minutes. The amplicon was gel-purified using Gen-Elute gel extraction kit (Sigma Aldrich) and quantitated. Sequential restriction digestion of pIRES vector and the amplicon was performed with XbaI and SalI enzymes. The digests were again gel-purified, and a ligation reaction was set up with a vector:insert ratio of 1:3 using T4 DNA ligase (Thermo Scientific), in a volume of 20 \u00b5L. After overnight incubation at 16\u00b0C, 10 \u00b5L of the reaction mixture was used to transform competent Escherichia coli DH5\u03b1 cells by a standard heat-shock procedure. Transformants were subsequently identified on a selective Luria Bertani (LB)-ampicillin agar plate, and the identity of the recombinants was verified by colony PCR using MydFor and MydRev primers. Glycerol stocks of the recombinants were made and stored at -80\u00b0C till further use.",

[23] studied the effect of co-administration of plasmids encoding chemokine and cytokine genes (RANTES, MCP-1, MIP-1-\u03b2, and TRANCE) in plasmid vaccines against rabies, and observed a modest adjuvant effect to a secreted and truncated form of the protein. The authors commented that genetic adjuvants may be unable to influence early events of immune response, due to temporal differences in expression of the immunogen and the adjuvant genes. The present study, in contrast, evaluated immune responses to plasmids co-expressing viral glycoprotein and Myd88 genes. Co-expression of both the genes was appreciable in fluorescently-stained transfected cells, and it would seem likely that MyD88 expression could have influenced activation and maturation of antigen presenting cells at the site of inoculation. An early onset and a high initial titre of RVNA would be ideal in the context of rabies vaccination. Whereas the former holds critical importance in post-exposure prophylaxis, the decline of antibody responses to non-protective levels can be delayed by high initial titres of RVNA. This would be beneficial in maintaining protective immunity over long periods in immunized animals, especially in canines. Findings from the study appear to suggest the ability of Myd88 adjuvanting in influencing these two relevant attributes of protective immunity against rabies.",
