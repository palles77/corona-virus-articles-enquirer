            "text": "A water-soluble extract of fermented Polygonum tinctorium Aiton (Polygonaceae) called Sukumo, exhibited a potent inhibitory activity against HIV type 1 in vitro. The extract potently suppressed acute HIV-1 (III B ) infection in MT-4 cells with EC 50 values of 0.5 g/ml but exhibited low cytotoxicity to MT-4 cells even at a high concentration (CC 50 > 1000 g/ml). It also inhibited giant cell formation in co-cultures of HIV-infected cells and uninfected Molt-4 cells. Sukumo extract was found to interact with both the viral envelope glycoprotein and cellular receptors, thus blocking virus-cell binding and virus-induced syncytium formation. There was a good correlation between the extract's anti-HIV-1 activity and its inhibitory effects on HIV-1 binding. It also suppressed replication of herpes simplex virus type 1 in Vero cells with an EC 50 of 11.56 g/ml. On the other hand, there was no appreciable activity against influenza A virus, poliovirus or SARS corona virus when tested at concentrations ranging from 3.2-400 g/ml as shown by microscopic image analysis for cytopathic effect (CPE). Physico-chemical studies revealed that the anti-HIV activity in the extract was essentially maintained after boiling at 100 \u2022 C in 1N HCl or 1N NaOH, and after treatment with 100 mM NaIO 4 . The inhibitory activity of the extract was also not reduced after pronase digestion. The active factor in the extract is likely to be a novel compound(s) having a polyanionic substructure and a molecular weight of 10,000-50,000.",

            "text": "One of the logical targets of the viral life cycle at which to inhibit HIV-1 replication is the step in the process where the infectious virion enters its host cell (Moore and Stevenson, 2000; Lin et al., 2002) . Therefore, the identification of HIV entry inhibitors, which can serve as novel anti-HIV drugs, is urgently needed. Retroviral infection is initiated by the attachment of the virion to the cell surface, which even occurs before glycoproteins on the viral envelope interact with specific receptors on the host cell to trigger fusion. A great variety of polyanionic compounds have been described which act as virus adsorption inhibitors. This class of compounds also comprises the cosalane analogues, containing the polycarboxylate pharmacophore, as well as the sulfated polysaccharides extracted from sea algae (Nakashima et al., 1987a (Nakashima et al., , 1992 Santhosh et al., 2001; Witvrouw and De Clercq, 1997) . All of these compounds are assumed to exert their anti-HIV activity by shielding the positively charged sites in the V3 loop region of the viral gp120 envelope glycoprotein, and interrupting virus attachment to the negatively charged heparan sulfate proteoglycans on cell surface, and inhibiting the specific binding to the CD4 receptor of CD4 + cells. Some of these compounds can also interfere with later events in receptor-mediated fusion by virtue of attachment to gp120. These compounds probably do not penetrate into cells because of their mass and highly anionic charge, but rather, act as antiviral agents by impeding the attachment and subsequent entry of virus particles into the cell.",

The extent of inhibition appeared to be dependent on both the viral strain and host cell type. Dextran sulfate interferes with the association of gp120 with CXCR4 while having no detectable effect on gp120-CD4. The interaction between polyanions and X4 or X4R5 gp120 was readily detectable, whereas weak or undetectable binding was observed with R5 gp120 (Moulard et al., 2000) . Cosalanes inhibited the binding of gp120 to CD4 as well as the fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane and is more potent against R5 HIV-1 RF in CEM-SS cells than against vs X4 HIV-1 IIIB in MT-4 cells (Santhosh et al., 2001) .",

Extracted constituents of this medicinal plant, such as tryptanthrin, has been shown to possess anti-fungal, cancer chemopreventive and anti-bacterial activities (Honda and Tabata, 1979; Koya-Miyata et al., 2001; Kataoka et al., 2001; Miyake et al., 2003) , while pigment (PtP) has an anti-anaphylactic activity (Kim et al., 1998) . In this study, we report for the first time the potent anti-HIV-1 and HSV-1 activity of an aqueous extract from the fermented leaves of Polygonum tinctorium (Sukumo). This extract was found to be highly selective against HIV-1 and HSV-1 in vitro. Sukumo extract suppresses production of HIV-1 by inhibiting the viral entry process through binding to the virus envelope and thus preventing HIV-induced syncytium formation with an exceedingly broad therapeutic window. Based on the results of physico-chemical analysis of the anti-viral active factor, it is putatively a novel polyanionic high-molecular-weight compound containing a phenolic substructure in aqueous extract of Sukumo.",

As shown in Fig. 4C , fractions 6 and 7 obtained from the viral control exhibited high HIV-1 activity (161.35 and 226.32 ng/ml in p24 level) 4 days after infection while fractions 6 and 7 from the Sukumo extract-virus mixture had p24 levels as low as 21.6 and 13.76 ng/ml, respectively. These results strongly suggests that the Sukumo extract specifically bound to viral particles and was efficiently trapped by viral particles so that viral infectivity was significantly abrogated due to the blockage of entry into the cells.",

The Sukumo extract was also separated by using SDS-PAGE and anti-HIV-1 activity was detected in fractions 3-7 of the SDS-gel extracts corresponding to a molecular weight of 10,000-50,000 (Fig. 6B) . Gas chromatography analysis of the acid hydrolysates of the Sukumo extract revealed the carbohydrate contents of Ara:Xyl:Man:Gal:Glc were 5.1:1:2.1:3.3:2.6 ( Table 1) and SDS-PAGE/PAS staining yielded a bright red band (Zacharius et al., 1969 ) (data not shown).

Effect of Sukumo extract on VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1 replication. 293T cells were infected with the HIV-1 NL-E strain lacking env and nef with VSV-G envelope of pesudotyped virus. 0.16-100 g/ml Sukumo extract was used and anti-HIV-1 activity was determined 3 days later by measuring p24 Gag. Treatment A (a pre-entry step): the cells were incubated with Sukumo extract for 2 h at 37 \u2022 C and washed before exposure to virus, and then the cells were infected and incubated in the absence of Sukumo extract. Treatment B (an entry step): the cells were exposed to virus in the presence of Sukumo extract for 2 h, then both Sukumo extract and unabsorbed viruses were removed by washing. The cells were further incubated in the absence of Sukumo extract. Treatment C (a post-entry step): the cells were infected with virus for 2 h, unabsorbed virus were removed and further incubated in presence of Sukumo extract. Sukumo extract ( Table 1 ). The anti-viral factor in Sukumo extract was stable under a wide range of pH conditions. As shown in Table 2 , the anti-viral activity of Sukumo extract was not reduced after treatment with 6N H 2 SO 4 , 1N HCl or NaIO 4 , but the value of EC 50 (1.095 g/ml) was somewhat decreased when it was treated with 1N NaOH. The activity was also not lost after being heated at 121 \u2022 C for 20 min and was not inactivated by protease (trypsin, proteinase K and pronase) digestion.

When Sukumo extract was boiled at 100 \u2022 C in 6N H 2 SO 4 and 1N HCl for 6 h the 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) against HIV-1 was essentially unaffected. In sharp contrast, when heparin was boiled at 100 \u2022 C in 6N H 2 SO 4 for 6 h or dextran sulfate in 1N HCl for 2 h, the 50% effective concentrations against HIV-1 were >940 and >1000 g/ml by MTT assay, while those of the untreated samples were 8.2095 and 0.7707 g/ml, respectively (Table 2) .",

The data presented in Fig. 3 indicate that Sukumo extract is able to block viral binding to target cells and inhibits virus-induced cell-cell fusion. Furthermore, a time-course experiment showed that the full protective activity of Sukumo extract was achieved when the compound was present during the 2-h virus adsorption period, but none of the effect was seen when the compound was incubated with the cells prior to viral infection. Also, the extract did not suppress the viral replication after the virus had entered the cells.

Furthermore, boiling of the Sukumo extract in the presence of 1N HCl, 6N H 2 SO 4 and 1N NaOH for 6 h did not result in any loss of this activity. Similarly, it was not inactivated by NaIO 4 treatment (Nakashima et al., 1987b) , which breaks down carbohydrates (Table 2 ).

The pharmaceutical value of the Sukumo extract is likely to be further enhanced by its stability over a wide range of pH values, as shown by the heating at 121 \u2022 C 20 min and treatment with acid and alkaline conditions.
