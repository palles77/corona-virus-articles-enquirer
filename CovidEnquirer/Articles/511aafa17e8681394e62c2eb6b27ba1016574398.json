For the purposes of this chapter, we define a \"signature\" as one or more strings of contiguous genomic DNA or RNA bases sufficient to identify a pathogenic target of interest at the desired resolution and that could be instantiated with particular detection chemistry on a particular platform. The target resolution may be taxonomic identification of a whole organism, an individual functional mechanism (e.g., a toxin gene), or simply a nucleic acid region indicative of the organism. The desired resolution will vary with each program's goals but could easily range from family to genus to species to strain to isolate. Resolution need not be taxonomically based but could be pan-mechanistic in nature: detecting virulence or antibiotic-resistance genes shared by multiple microbes. Entire industries exist around different detection chemistries and instrument platforms for identification of pathogens, and we only briefly mention a few of the techniques that have been used at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) to support our biosecurity-related work since 2000. Most nucleic acidebased detection chemistries involve the ability to isolate and amplify the signature target region(s), combined with a technique to detect that amplification. Signatures may be employed for detection and/or characterization of known organisms, by focusing on unique genomic differences, or as ways of discovering new ones by focusing on highly conserved genomic regions.",

Classic biochemical typing methods were developed long before knowledge of DNA and resulted in dozens of tests (Gram's stain, differential growth characteristics media, etc.) that could be used to roughly characterize the major known pathogens (of course, some are uncultivable). These tests could take many days to complete and precise resolution of species and strains is not always possible. In contrast, protein recognition signatures composed of antibodies or synthetic highaffinity ligands offer extremely fast results but require a large quantity of the target to be present. False positives/negatives are also a problem with some protein-based techniques (home pregnancy kits use this basic approach).",

Mechanism signatures can be best thought of as identifying sets of one or more genes that result in functional properties such as virulence, antibiotic resistance, or host range. The primary reason to identify mechanisms, independent of organisms, is to detect potential genetic engineering. A secondary reason is that nature has shared many important mechanisms over evolutionary time, and thus they may not be sufficiently unique to identify specific \"chassis\" organisms. Knowledge of whether a particular isolate has the full virulence kit or possesses unusual antibiotic-resistance properties and whether it is human transmissible is important for biodefense and public health responses. Method signatures present yet another dimension of analyzing pathogens: evidence of potential bacterial genetic engineering may be seen in a genome by checking for traces of the bacterial vector(s) that may have been used to insert one or more foreign genes and related components (promoters, etc.) into the genome being modified. In the future, host range signatures might indicate that an otherwise uncharacterized pathogen was potentially capable of evading or defeating the immune system of a particular host organism.",

Using anthrax as an example, a detection signature might be trying to answer the question \"Is there Bacillus anthracis in this air or soil or surface swipe sample?\" One or more signatures might be used for environmental sampling to indicate the possible presence of that pathogen. In contrast, a diagnostic signature would be attempting to answer, \"Does this person have Bacillus anthracis in their nasal cavity now?\" Such a signature would need to be embodied in an assay that is approved by the US FDA (Food and Drug Administration; we are not aware of any licensed anthrax diagnostic assays at this time), even if the genomic signature is the same as in the environmental example (where regulation is not required). Characterization signatures would be trying to answer questions such as \"Which known strain(s) are closest to this sample and what differences are observed?\" or \"How similar is this attack sample to another sample from a suspect's home laboratory?\"; both of which might be answered by whole-genome sequencing or a large set of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or other genomic markers via PCR or an array. Thus, signatures involve an intended use (detection, diagnostic, characterization), a specific required resolution (genus, species, strain, gene, SNP), a desired low error rate, plus cost, and time constraints specific to the use case.",

Design of genomic signatures for pathogen identification and characterization primarily in identifying bacteria, viruses, and fungi that could potentially be used to threaten human, animal, or plant life, to disrupt our economy, or to disturb our social order. Note that there is a wide range of genome sizes involved. RNA viruses are generally small (foot and mouth disease virus is about 8 kbp, SARS coronavirus is about 30 kbp), whereas the variola virus (causative agent of smallpox) is a large DNA virus of about 200 kbp. High-threat bacterial pathogens tend to be in the 2e5-Mbp size range (Yersinia pestis, causative agent of plague, is about 4 Mbp while Bacillus anthracis is about 5 Mbp.). Fungi can range from 10 Mbp to over 700 Mbp. As costs scale roughly with genome size, the sequencing databases have many more viral genomes than bacterial and many more bacterial genomes than fungal. In comparison, the human genome is about 3 Gbp and wheat is about 16 Gbp.",

In past years, a large distinction was drawn between detection signatures and forensic signatures, where forensic signatures were typically thought of as at the strain level or below (typically thought of as substrain or isolate specific). When microbial sequencing was quite expensive, techniques such as MLVA (multiple locus variable number of tandem repeat Analysis) were employed for forensic characterization (Keim et al., 2000) . PCR amplicons covering regions containing variable numbers of tandem repeats were measured to provide patterns which corresponded to evolutionary distance. More recently, the distinction between detection and forensic signatures has become blurred because historic taxonomic distinctions have become less certain and because new signature techniques provide increased resolution levels. Using either wholegenome sequencing or current commercially available microarray technologies that allow a million or more signatures to be designed on each chip, one can simultaneously interrogate the entire resolution range (genus, species, strain, and isolate) for desired pathogen targets, providing both detection and forensic resolution. Signature design today is a combination of the desired signature purpose, our current understanding of the diversity of the organism being targeted, and the specific mission constraints that may dictate the detection chemistry and platform to be used for either biodefense or public health. Given the drastically lowered cost of whole-genome sequencing of microbes, we anticipate that the use of all techniques with lower resolution for genomic characterization will diminish in the coming years.",

Draft genomes are composed of multiple sets of overlapping reads, called \"contigs,\" potentially with little or no information about the order or orientation of the contigs relative to the original genome. Draft sequence is often described by a depth factor, which is a numeric statement about the average redundancy of coverage at any base position, and thus confidence. A 30X draft sequence would have, on average, at least 30 overlapping reads that contain each base in the genome being sequenced; this is a common minimal average depth for modern draft sequencing, but microbial projects with far greater read depth are also common.",

This often lengthy and costly process, when and if completed, produces a single string of highquality bases from the individual and scrambled contigs of the draft sequence. Obviously, finished genomes are superior to drafts when it comes to performing annotation of gene content or other features, as well as for performing multiple-sequence alignments (MSAs) to compare two or more genomes. In our early Sanger sequence experience at LLNL, a 10X draft microbial genome provides sufficient information for DNA signature design purposes (Gardner et al., 2005) ; modern isolate sequencing of microbes typically yields at least 100X coverage (meaning on average at least 100 separate reads cover each base in the final genome). When you consider that finished microbial genomes can be 10 times as expensive as draft, due to the large amounts of skilled labor required to close draft sequencing gaps, it is not surprising that many microbial genomes may never be finished. Increasingly, short-read sequences are being mapped to reference genomes in lieu of a de novo assembly, and we expect finished genomes to become increasingly rare as the cost of draft sequencing continues to decrease.",

Only a tiny fraction of organisms can be cultured in vitro, and our knowledge base remains greatly skewed toward those that can. At other times, it is because what is desired is a sampling of an entire community of organisms. Although numerous metagenomic samples have been sequenced, it is exceedingly rare for complete assemblies of sequences from multiple organisms to result. One exception is a very small symbiotic bacterial community found living in an extremely harsh acidic environment in a mine (Allen et al., 2007) . Metagenomic data are not currently of much utility for genomic signature development. A paper on the acid mine microbial community is providing clues about the evolution of viral resistance (Banfield and Andersson, 2008) , which illustrates the vital role metagenomic sequencing will play in expanding our systems biology knowledge at both the organism and the ecosystem level.",

Physical contamination of sequencing instruments or sequencing reagents have also caused problems with database quality, as have errors in the DNA barcodes used to multiplex samples on a single sequencing run. We have encountered situations where some human sequence present in one obscure draft microbial genome led that organism to show hundreds of thousands of reads in every human sample analyzed, until the offending genome was removed from the microbial reference database. Beware that the other direction of contamination can also occur (microbial sequence incorrectly present in human genomes.)

Alignments sometimes fail when input sequences are very long or when there is a large number of sequences to be aligned (depth), even if the sequences are not particularly long. Failure happens because an MSA takes impractically long to finish due to the intractable algorithmic complexity involved or due to a lack of memory on the machine being use. These limitations mean that the optimal alignment approach may vary depending on the breadth and depth of sequences used as input. The recent explosion of genome sequence data has resulted in a lack of MSA algorithms that can scale appropriately. Clustering is one common way to attempt to reduce input data size. This works well when the goal is to analyze for regions in common to design signatures; however, it works less well when one is trying to detect SNPs that provide maximal differentiation. In recent years, with the massive numbers of whole genomes available for many species of interest, MSA has become an increasingly poor solution choice.",

MUMmer (Kurtz et al., 2004 ) is a notable MSA program in this respect because it can align draft and complete genomes.

Consequently, PCR-based signatures for viral detection often require high levels of degeneracy or multiplexing to detect all variants robustly. Large amounts of sequence data are often required to represent the range of target diversity, sometimes hundreds to thousands of genomes. As noted previously, building MSAs with many diverse genomes taxes the capabilities of most available software. Once an alignment is built, it may reveal insufficient consensus for even a single primer, much less a pair, to detect all members of some species (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus 1 or influenza A).",

This approach implies that multiple signatures will be required for species-level detection of all subgroups. One must make an assessment in advance of signature design of how best to subdivide the target sequences. A second approach is to allow degenerate or inosine bases so that a single signature will detect the diverse genomes within a target species. Specificity may suffer if some combinations of degenerate bases also pick up nontarget species. Sensitivity may decline, as the specific priming sequence for a given target is diluted in the degenerate mix. Several tools that require a MSA as input are available for degenerate primer design (e.g., SCPrimer Jabado et al., 2006 PrimaClade http://primaclade.org/cgibin/primaclade.cgi, Amplicon http:// amplicon.sourceforge.net/, and HYDEN http://acgt.cs.tau.ac.il/hyden/).",

            "text": "A third approach employed is called MSC (Gardner et al., 2003) . Because it avoids the need for MSA or a priori subgrouping of target sequences, this method can be run blindly without expert knowledge of the target species. It begins by removing nonunique regions from consideration as primers or probes from each of the target sequences relative to a database of nontarget sequences. The remaining unique regions of each target sequence are mined for candidate signatures, without regard for conservation among other targets, yet satisfying user specifications for primer and probe length, T m , GC%, amplicon length, and so on. All candidate signatures are compared to all targets and clustered by the subset of targets they are predicted to detect. To predict detection, we may require that a signature's primers and probe have a perfect match to target in the correct orientation and proximity, or we may relax the match requirements to allow a limited number of mismatches, as long as T m remains above a specified threshold or those mismatches do not occur too close to the 3 0 end of a primer. Signatures within a given cluster are equivalent in that they are predicted to detect the same subset of targets, so by clustering we reduce the redundancy and size of the problem to finding a small set of signatures that detect all targets. Nevertheless, computing the optimal solution of the fewest clusters to detect all targets is an \"NP complete\" or intractable problem, so for large datasets we use a greedy algorithm to find a small number of clusters that together should pick up all targets. LLNL has used this method to design signature sets for numerous RNA viruses, including influenza A HA serotypes, foot and mouth disease, Norwalk, CrimeaneCongo hemorrhagic fever, ebola, and other divergent viruses . Fig. 20 .1 shows the result of an MSC computation for Crimeane Congo hemorrhagic fever performed in 2005, with the resulting signatures displayed against a whole-genome phylogenetic tree of all the sequences available at that time.",

            "text": "Detecting evidence for genetic engineering in bacteria is challenging when the target modification is not known and the effects of an outbreak on human health are not well understood. We may, for example, anticipate a biological outbreak that employs a bacterial host containing a foreign toxin, but the observed effects of the toxin may not implicate a known gene. Even in cases where the gene is known, it may be difficult to rule out a natural origin for the outbreak. In such cases, it may be useful to search for more direct evidence of the genetic engineering tools used to insert and express foreign genes in a bacterial host. Among the most widely used and readily available tools for genetic engineering in bacteria are artificial vector DNA molecules. Genetic engineering with artificial vectors began with efforts to improve on early work using natural plasmids for gene cloning. Natural plasmids are extrachromosomal replicons (self-replicating molecules) that come in both circular and linear form and are generally nonessential genetic material for the bacterial host but can confer important phenotypes such as virulence and drug resistance. These plasmids are mobile displayed against a whole-genome phylogenetic tree of available target genomes. Note that signatures 45 and 51 cover a wide range of isolates from one geographical location, whereas signatures 28, 39, and 50 cover isolates found in Eastern Europe. Signatures 1, 5, 17, and 22 are required to detect some historical isolates that are not likely to be in current circulation. genetic elements that serve as a natural mechanism for the exchange of genetic material across different bacterial species (Frost et al., 2005) . Artificial vectors are natural plasmid derivatives designed to improve support for the insertion and manipulation of foreign genetic elements in the carrier plasmid. We use the term \"artificial vector\" to refer to replicons created through human intervention to explicitly distinguish them from their natural plasmid precursors. Sequence features designed to support genetic manipulation form the basis for methods used to distinguish artificial vector sequence from natural plasmids. The most common artificial vector-specific feature is the multiple cloning site region, which is a sequence insert containing clusters of restriction enzyme sites used to facilitate insertion of the foreign gene elements. Selection marker genes also play an important role in selecting bacteria, which maintain the artificial vector. The gene transcription control unit, which includes a promoter sequence and transcription terminator sequence for the foreign gene elements, is also an important feature, along with the origin of replication site required for maintenance of the artificial vector in the bacterial colony (Solar et al., 1998) . Detecting an artificial vector sequence in a mixed bacterial sample is best accomplished via metagenomic sequence analysis. We note that this task can be very difficult if any E. coli is present in the sample, as most artificial vectors are derived from an E. coli chassis.",

Resequencing arrays can provide sequence information for viruses closely related (0.90% similarity) to sequences from which the array was designed. Discovery arrays to detect more diverse and more distantly related organisms have been built using techniques for selecting probes from regions of known conservation based on BLAST nucleotide sequence similarity (Wang et al., 2003) or profile HMM and motif indications of amino acid sequence conservation (Jabado et al., 2008) . Array design to span an entire kingdom on a single microarray demands substantial investment in probe selection algorithms. Beginning in 2007, LLNL designed a microarray to detect all bacteria, plasmids, and viruses based on all available whole-genome, whole-segment, and whole-plasmid sequences. We attempted to find probes that are unique to each viral and bacterial family and favor probes conserved within a family. We used probes 50e65 bases long, enabling sensitive detection of targets with some sequence variation relative to the probe. We used a greedy minimal set coverage algorithm to ensure that all database sequences (genomes or chromosomes or viral segments) have at least 50 (for viruses) or 15 (for bacteria and plasmids) probes per sequence. We allowed some mismatches between probe and target, based on previous mismatch experiments in which we determined that probes with a contiguous match at least 29 bases long and with 85% sequence similarity between probe and target still gave a strong signal intensity . We developed a novel statistical method that is based on likelihood maximization within a Bayesian network, incorporating a sophisticated probabilistic model of probe-target hybridization developed and validated with experimental data from hundreds of thousands of probe intensity measurements (McLoughlin, 2011) . The method is designed to enable quantifiable predictions of likelihood for the presence of each of multiple organisms in a complex, mixed sample, which is especially important in an environmental sample or one with chimeric organisms.",

            "text": "Earlier we mentioned difficulties with the evolving taxonomy of pathogenic organisms, as classification schemes originally developed based on phenomenology are faced now with genomic inconsistencies. The current flood of metagenomic data is presenting us with an even larger problem: what exactly do concepts such as \"species\" and \"strains\" mean if it turns out that microbial life is a broad spectrum with few well-defined transitions? It is now common to refer to a \"core genome\" and additional distinct gene content variations (\"pan genome\") that presumably is responsible for different phenotypes (Nelson et al., 2004) . It is possible that new concepts and terminology will be needed to map existing taxonomic categories into the genomic reality of the 21st century. Similarly, compressed genome data storage techniques, including just mapping differences relative to reference genomes of one or more species, may be leveraged to reduce data storage, transfer, and computation bottlenecks (Hosseini et al., 2016) .",

The field of pathogen diagnostics is riding this technology wave, too small a market to have any direct influence. Note that the read lengths of some new sequencing technologies may be too short to provide confident pathogen identification based on a single read, meaning that direct metagenomic identification of human pathogens from complex clinical or environmental samples contains some degree of uncertainty. Microarrays will have to ride their own faster/less expensive/more information-per-chip curve if they are not to become obsolete within a few years. Alternatively, one could argue that future advances in protein detection technology could lead to breakthroughs in fast dipstick assays (similar to current home pregnancy test kits) that could provide fast, accurate, and inexpensive results for pathogen detection. In all likelihoods, all these techniques will continue to compete as they evolve asynchronously.",

Hair also has the added benefit of high stability over long time frames and under extreme conditions. Comprised primarily of keratins and keratin-associated proteins, hair exhibits high durability that contributes to its persistence. Packed into coiled-coils within the hair shaft, hair keratins are stabilized via crosslinking by cystine disulfide bonds as well as by isopeptide bonds between proteins (Zhang et al., 2015; Wolfram, 2003) . Finally, evidence comprised of hair, bone, and other major tissue types of interest are easily parsed, largely eliminating complications associated with mixed or multicontributor samples that can be limiting for DNA analysis.",

It has also been shown that it is possible to determine the sex from skeletal remains, specifically teeth, of children under 15 years of age, a range where classical morphological techniques are not reliable. In addition, different ethnicities have been shown to carry common amino acid mutations. These markers have utility in providing biogeographic background information, even from archaeological specimens. Once the procedures are validated and GVP reference libraries are established, GVPs will open up an entirely new field of forensics.",
