            "text": "CPV-2 infection is typically seen in young dogs without protective antibody titers, because of a lack of or an incomplete series of vaccinations. A window of susceptibility also occurs in puppies, in which maternal antibody falls below protective levels but vaccine-induced immunity is lacking. A breed predilection in Rottweilers, Doberman Pinschers, and Staffordshire Terriers has been reported, and male dogs may be more commonly affected [4] . Additionally, a seasonal prevalence in the summer months occurs in temperate climates. Clinical signs of CPV-2 infection include lethargy, anorexia, vomiting, bloody diarrhea, fever, and dehydration, and the clinical course is often protracted. Leukopenia characterized by decreased neutrophil and lymphocyte counts is considered a laboratory hallmark of the disease and results from viral lymphocytolysis, bone marrow precursor destruction, and peripheral neutrophil consumption. Anemia and hypoproteinemia are common as a consequence of gastrointestinal (GI) blood loss and prolonged malnutrition. Significant secondary complications of CPV-2 infection include intestinal intussusception, sepsis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). A diagnosis of CPV-2 infection is confirmed by virus isolation, electron microscopy, fecal hemagglutination, or fecal ELISA testing. The ELISA antigen test (CITE, Idexx, Sacramento, California) performed on fecal material is the most common and practical diagnostic test in a clinical setting; negative test results can be seen early in the course of disease, and modified-live virus vaccines can cause weak positive test results from 5 to 15 days after vaccination [5] . Treatment of CPV-2 infections includes aggressive intravenous fluid therapy, parenteral nutrition, antibiotics, and antiemetics. Fluid therapy is directed toward maintenance of hydration and control of metabolic consequences, such as hypokalemia or hypoglycemia. Colloid therapy (eg, hetastarch, plasma) is indicated in cases with severe hypoproteinemia, and blood product administration may be necessary if anemia becomes sufficiently severe. Parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is mandatory because of disruption of the GI mucosal barrier and concomitant severe neutropenia; ampicillin or a first-or second-generation cephalosporin in combination with an aminoglycoside (eg, cefazolin, amikacin) is quite effective. Recommended antiemetics include metoclopramide as a constant-rate infusion or prochlorperazine (Table 1 ). Both are centrally acting agents, and metoclopramide also acts as a GI prokinetic agent. With aggressive treatment, the prognosis for recovery from CPV-2 infection is considered good, and 80% to 90% of affected dogs recover. Certain breeds (eg, Rottweilers) may experience higher mortality, however. Prophylactic vaccines are available and are effective if the manufacturer's directions are followed carefully.",

Most likely, these organisms are opportunists and establish pathogenicity when some other insult has occurred to disrupt the GI microenvironment. The incidence of infections seems to be highest in young kenneled animals or in immunocompromised patients. Clinical signs typically include watery, mucoid, or hemorrhagic diarrhea; in some cases (eg, Salmonella), systemic spread resulting in sepsis can occur. The diagnosis is established by specific fecal culture (eg, Salmonella spp, Campylobacter spp) or toxin assays (eg, Clostridia spp), whereas in some instances (eg, enteropathogenic E coli), there are no practical clinically available diagnostic tests. Treatment is appropriate antibiotic therapy; however, antibiotic resistance and carrier states represent significant concerns, and a decision to treat is based on the animal's clinical status rather than merely laboratory detection of a potentially pathogenic organism [1] .",

A caninum can be associated with severe hemorrhagic enteritis and anemia in puppies. Diagnosis of endoparasitic infestations is most commonly made by fecal flotation, and centrifugation techniques may improve diagnostic accuracy. S stercoralis may be demonstrated by the Baermann flotation technique or by observation of larvae in fresh fecal smears. Giardia infections can be diagnosed by observation of motile trophozoites in fresh fecal smears or by detection of cysts using zinc sulfate fecal flotation; however, a more recently developed fecal ELISA test that detects Giardia antigen is the preferred diagnostic test.",

It can safely be assumed that almost all puppies, for example, have T canis infection because of transplacental or transmammary larval transmission [1] , and some regimens suggest treatment every 2 to 4 weeks until 16 weeks of age and then every 6 months thereafter. Control of many helminth infections can be easily accomplished by monthly administration of combined anthelmintic and heartworm preventative (eg, ivermectin plus pyrantel pamoate). Treatment of Dipylidium infections must include adequate flea control as well as an appropriate anthelmintic, such as praziquantel. Coccidial infections are treated with sulfa-containing drugs, such as sulfadimethoxine or trimethoprim sulfa; although frequently diagnosed and treated in the clinical setting, most coccidial infections are likely selflimiting. Fenbendazole is the recommended treatment for Giardia infection; although metronidazole is commonly used, it is proven less effective than fenbendazole and has greater potential for side effects [6] . A Giardia vaccine is also available, and it has been suggested that it may be effective in clearing refractory infections [7] ; however, vaccination against Giardia failed to decrease the incidence of diarrhea associated with giardiasis in one field study (A.D. Davidson, DVM, MS, personal communication, 2001). Some endoparasites may pose significant public health concerns, including T canis (ie, visceral and ocular larval migrans) and Giardia spp, and appropriate client counseling is advised.",

            "text": "Most nonspecific enterocolitises of young animals (ie, dietary indiscretions) are acute and self-limiting, although clinical signs can be fulminant and even life threatening in certain cases. The diagnosis in such cases is usually straightforward and is based on the history, typical clinical signs, and examination findings. Symptomatic treatment is warranted in most cases before extensive diagnostic procedures, and most patients with nonspecific enterocolitis show marked improvement in 24 to 48 hours with little or no treatment. General principles of treatment include removal or avoidance of the inciting cause, correction of metabolic or electrolyte disturbances, promotion of GI mucosal repair, and control of secondary complications (ie, vomiting or abdominal pain). Dietary restriction represents the primary mode of treatment, and withholding of food for 24 to 48 hours is typically recommended. In theory, withholding of food leads to more rapid restoration of mucosal integrity and return to normal function as well as decreasing diarrhea by eliminating irritant or osmotic effects of undigested nutrients. There is an opposing school of thought that espouses ''feeding through the diarrhea'' on the premise that continued provision of micronutrients hastens restoration of mucosal integrity; benefits of this approach may be more relevant in secretory diarrhea, which is likely uncommon in small animal patients [1] . If clinical signs abate with an appropriate period of GI rest, gradual introduction of a highly digestible, reduced-fat, low-fiber diet is done using cooked rice or cereal supplemented with low-fat cottage cheese, chicken or lean ground beef, or baby foods. Alternatively, there are many commercial or prescription diets formulated for GI disease that may be used. A normal diet may be reintroduced over several days if clinical signs have resolved. Bismuth subsalicylate can be used empirically as a GI protectant if necessary (see Table 1 ), and there is evidence that salicylates may decrease intestinal hypersecretion by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Salicylate-containing compounds should be used cautiously in cats.",

The primary principle of a dietary exclusion trial is to feed dietary components to which the patient has not been previously exposed, and this diet should represent the sole nutrition source for the period of the trial. The recommended exclusion diet should consist of a single protein and carbohydrate source. Typically, a ''novel protein'' combined with rice is used; diets may be homemade, although there are also a plethora of appropriate commercial exclusion diets that consist of chicken, soy, fish, venison, or duck combined with carbohydrates, such as rice, corn, tapioca, or potato. Hydrolyzed protein diets (eg, Hill's Ultra Z/D, Hill's, Topeka, Kansas; Purina HA or LA, Purina, St. Louis, Missouri) are also available, in which proteins have been hydrolyzed into components of a molecular weight purportedly too small to elicit an immune response, although there is not proof that these diets are superior to the more standard novel protein diet. The trial diet is typically fed for a period of 3 weeks [1] , although it has been shown that cases of food-allergic skin disease may require up to 10 weeks for remission. Treatment consists of continuation of a diet formulated based on the response to the exclusion trial; many suitable commercial diets are available and may be preferable because they are nutritionally balanced and more convenient.",
