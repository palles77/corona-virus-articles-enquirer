Whether practicing in a faculty clinic, public health facility, or hospital based environment, such as the emergency department or urgent care center, there are some common practices that can help reduce the spread of communicable diseases, and facilitate more rapid diagnosis, treatment, and control of infectious illnesses.",

The most immunogenic of the four structural proteins is the S protein, which is the virus' only surface glycoproteinit mediates viral attachment and fusion via the hDDP4.

Camel to human transmission is known [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Research suggests MERS CoV originated in bats before camels which may be the intermediate host. Closely related CoV have been found in bats from other regions [23, 24] . For example, a novel CoV found in a vesper bat from South Africa is very similar to MERS CoV, differing by only one amino acid. Studies suggest dromedary camels are the primary source for human infection. Nearly 67% of human cases are male, and the median age among reported cases is 52 [7] . The majority of cases are of Middle East origin, even though cases have been reported from outside the region, where they likely are seeking care, or are returning from travels. A CoV similar to the MERS CoV cases has been found in Camels from Egypt, Oman, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. Direct contact with saliva of infected camels, or consuming milk or meat from same are considered a risk factor. One study noted the seroprevalence of MERS CoV is several times higher in people with regular exposure to camels compared with the general population [17] [18] [19] although there are cases w/out contact with sick animals or products derived from them.",

Some studies have shown MERS CoV is associated with an attenuated interferon (IFN) response, and does not induce inflammatory cytokines [7, 32, 33] . However a study by Lau demonstrated delayed Proinflammatory cytokine induction by MERS CoV in Calu 3 cells, while there was a lack of production of antiviral cytokines TNF alpha, IFN beta, and IP 10 (5). TNF alpha is noted as an important acute phase pyrogen that inhibits viral replication. IFN beta can induce antiviral response via upregulation of host factors. By attenuating TNF alpha and IFN beta MERS CoV in comparison to SARS CoV may more readily evade innate antiviral host immunity. The possibility that MERS CoV attenuates innate immunity while inducing an inflammatory response in human lung epithelial cells also exists. A macaque model for MERS CoV revealed the virus caused localized to widespread pneumonia in all infection animals. MERS CoV was noted by Lau et al to increase IL 8. In RSV, higher levels of IL 8 seems to correlate with increased disease severity.",

Radiographic findings such as airspace opacities are nonspecific, whereas the interstitial changes were described as reticular or reticulonodular. Total lung opacification and thickening of the bronchovascular markings have been reported as well. Previous chest CT findings with MERS have been reported as bilateral patchy or extensive opacities [5] . Not unexpected, imaging that had features consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome were typically identified in sicker patients. In Aljan [31] MERS CoV the most common findings on CT ( Figure 11 ) were shows that airspace opacities on CT are common in patients hospitalized with MERS-CoV infection. Airspace opacities are suggestive of an organizing pneumonia pattern. It was also described in H1N1 influenza A viral infections. In most of our patients, ground-glass opacities were more extensive than consolidation. Septal thickening and pleural effusions also were demonstrated. Importantly, tree-in-bud pattern, cavitation, and lymph node enlargement were not seen in our cohort. Chest XRays and CT Scanning ( Figure 11 ) are recommended depending upon the presentation, and clinical course. In the Aljan study [31] the most common CT finding in hospitalized patients with MERS -CoV infection reveals predominantly subpleural and basilar airspace changes, with more ground glass opacities than consolidation. It is important to note this is a small study. Nevertheless this pattern is consistent with organizing pneumonia. Patients recently returning from the Middle East, presenting with significant respiratory illness, with CT findings of peribronchial region abnormalities, organizing pneumonia, should be considered for MERS CoV infection, and if possible, queried about international travel and occupational exposures.",

One attempt which shows early animal efficacy is by a vaccine candidate consisting of chimeric virus-like particles (VLP) expressing the receptor binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV. The researchers have fused canine parvovirus (CPV) VP2 structural protein gene with the RBD of MERS-CoV; it self-assembles into chimeric, spherical VLP (sVLP). This sVLP retained certain parvovirus characteristics, such as the ability to agglutinate pig erythrocytes, and structural morphology similar to CPV virions. Immunization with sVLP induced RBD-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. sVLP-specific antisera from these animals were able to prevent pseudotyped MERS-CoV entry into susceptible cells, with neutralizing antibody titers reaching 1: 320. Of note, Interferon (IFN) -IFN-\u03b3, IL-4 and IL-2 secreting cells induced by the RBD were detected in the splenocytes of vaccinated mice by ELISpot. Mice given sVLP or an adjuvanted sVLP vaccine elicited T-helper 1 (Th1) and T-helper 2 (Th2) cell-mediated immunity. Although early stage, research sVLP displaying the RBD of MERS-CoV may become, or lead to an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV. Human research is needed [41] .
