In this paper, considering the heterogeneity among communities, we construct a new community network model in which the communities show significant differences in average degree. Based on this heterogeneous community network, we propose a novel mathematical epidemic model for each community and study the epidemic dynamics in this network model. We find that the location of the initial infection node only affects the spreading velocity and barely influences the epidemic prevalence. And the epidemic threshold of entire network decreases with the increase of heterogeneity among communities. Moreover, the epidemic prevalence increases with the increase of heterogeneity around the epidemic threshold, while the converse situation holds when the infection rate is much greater than the epidemic threshold. (B. Song). example, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the H1N1 influenza A virus in 2009, the H7N9 avian influenza virus in 2013, the Ebola virus in 2014 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2015. The problem of epidemic spreading has gained great attention over the years and people want to predict the epidemic spread trend and take effective public health measures with limited vaccine supply. As the topology properties of networks have a profound impact on the dynamics of epidemic spreading, it is necessary to consider the effect of community structure on epidemic spreading. So far, a lot of results on epidemic dynamics in community networks have been obtained [12, 14, 16, 29, 30] .",

            "text": "With the development of network science, many common characteristics of real networks have been revealed, where one of the important characteristics is that a wide range of biological and social systems contains community structure [5, 9, 15, 17, [24] [25] [26] . Different individuals may form a community because of the same attributes, such as interest, age, profession and so on. As the large-scale outbreaks of epidemic diseases have occurred many times in different regions and different races in history, it can be said that the history of human history is a history of the struggle against different epidemic diseases. And with the progress of science and technology, the convenient transportation has also promoted the spread of the epidemic diseases to a great extent, for community links. They found that the existence of community makes the degree distribution get broader, and the epidemic threshold decreases with the increase of community strength (p/q) [11] . Huang and Li studied the SI dynamics on scale-free network with community structure, they found that the community structure makes the growth of the infection slow and the epidemic prevalence reduce [7] . Salath\u00e9 and Jones investigated the epidemic spread in empirical and artificial networks with community structure, and got the similar conclusion: the community structure has inhibiting effect on epidemic spreading, and the peak value of epidemic prevalence decreases with the increase of community strength. Moreover, they found that immunizing bridge nodes is more effective than simply immunizing highly connected nodes in networks with strong community structure [20] . To understand the influences of community structure and clustering coefficient on SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) dynamical processes, Wu and Liu presented a network model with adjustable clustering coefficient and adjustable community strength, and found that for a fixed community strength, the efficiency of epidemic spreading will decrease with increase of the clustering coefficient [27] . Chu et al. investigated the epidemic spreading on weighted scale-free networks with community structure, and found that compared to the internal weighting exponent, the external weighting exponent has higher impact on slowing the epidemic spreading [3] . On this basis, Min et al. further studied the spread of disease on weighted scale-free community network with two mixing styles [13] : a dense-weak style and a sparse-strong style. In [2] , the authors studied the epidemic dynamics on a network with overlapping community structure and found that the epidemic prevalence increases with the increase of overlapping region. Some scholars constructed a random network composed of a sparse community and a dense community, and they studied the phenomenon that the disease persists throughout the dense community, while the outbreak and extinction states occur periodically in the sparse community [18] . Shao et al. studied the epidemic dynamics in a small-world community structure network with consideration of a traffic-driven SIS epidemic model [21] , and found that the community structure can accelerate the epidemic spreading in the traffic-driven model. Stegehuis et al. studied two random network models that create a network with similar community structure [4] , and found that the community structure can both enforce as well as inhibit diffusion processes, and the exact internal structures of communities barely influence the behavior of spreading processes. Based on the SI (susceptible-infected) epidemic model, Shu et al. numerically studied how weak ties (connect pairs of nodes belonging to different communities) influence epidemic dynamics [23] . Some scholars studied the SEAIR (susceptibleexposed-asymptomatically infected-symptomatically infectedrecovered) [32] and the stochastic SIR [31] epidemic model on scale-free networks with community structure. Bonaccorsi et al. analyzed a continuous-time SIS model on a community structure network in which individuals that belong to different communities have different infecting probabilities [1] . Ren et al. investigated SIS epidemic spreading processes on a time-varying community structure network [19] . Xia et al. presented a new epidemic SIS model to investigate the spreading behavior on community structure networks with dynamical topology. They found that the epidemic threshold is only related with the population density within the community, and the long-range motion will make the original disease-free community become the endemic state [28] .",

However, in the real social networks, the physical contacts among individuals in some communities are more closer than in other communities, which reflects the heterogeneity among communities. For example, in real social networks, young students community interact with each other more frequently than elderly people community. Furthermore, studies have suggested that heterogeneity in contact patterns among individuals in heterogeneity communities has an important effect on the epidemic spreading [10] . In addition, many scholars are concerned about finding ways to suppress the spread of the virus, such as looking for more effective immune strategies and raising awareness of the individuals. While some scholars hope to find the source of epidemic spreading and control the epidemic spreading in the early stage of epidemic spreading [6, 8, 22, 33] . When there exists heterogeneity among the communities in the network, we are curious about whether the difference in the location of the source of infection will affect the spread of the virus, and want to study the transmission rule of epidemic on the community structure network with heterogeneity among communities, which is helpful for us to find an effective control strategy for epidemic spreading.",

And we analyze the impacts of heterogeneity among different communities and modularity coefficient on epidemic spreading either. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce in detail our network model, and the network characteristics are discussed either. In Section 3, we define the epidemic model and introduce the mean field equations.

Most of the models ignore the heterogeneity among communities, and how it affects the spread of epidemic is a practical and meaningful problem. In [10] , by observing the real populations in the populated city Hong Kong, the researchers find out that the heterogeneity of contact patterns of individuals within and between different age groups is an important impacting factor in the transmission of infectious diseases, so they take into account the age structure of a population and the different contact patterns among individuals in different age groups and propose an age-structured model. When the groups of different ages mentioned in Ref. [10] are regarded as different communities, the whole population in the city can be viewed as a community structure network with heterogeneity. In this section, we construct a new community structure network model with heterogeneity among communities based on random network, in which the average degree of each community may be different.",

It is well known that, in real networks, the outbreak of each epidemic is caused by a small number of infected individuals of a local area in the network. Since there are differences among communities, did the location of the initial infection node/nodes has effect on the epidemic spreading? To obtain a definitive answer, we do some simulations on three community structure networks, where each network is constructed based on ER random network model and has three communities with different heterogeneity. Figs. 1-3 show the time evolution curves of epidemic size of three different networks, where the average degrees of three networks are the same, but with different average degrees in each the seed node locations, we assume that the network models have the same average degree of the entire network ( \u27e8k\u27e9 = 20 ) and the community sizes are n 1 = n 2 = n 3 = 500 . We find that, for each network, the location of the infection source affects only the propagation velocity rather than the epidemic prevalence. We also observe that the time duration to reach the steady state is inversely proportional to the heterogeneity among communities. In each simulation, an initial infected node is randomly chosen from a specified community. And for each network, 5000 simulations are taken with a randomly chosen seed node initially. The other simulation parameters are: the infection rate \u03bb = 0.1 and the modularity coefficient Q = 0.6. Fig. 4 shows the effects of heterogeneity among communities on epidemic threshold and prevalence. In the simulations, there are three communities within the network and the communities sizes are n 1 = n 2 = n 3 = 500. We keep the degree of entire network to be constant at \u27e8k\u27e9 = 20 . The graph contains three sets of data, which compare the thresholds and prevalence of epidemic of these community networks. The lines with red dots, black circle and blue asterisk respectively correspond to the networks with intra-community degrees \u27e8k i \u27e9 = {10, 20, 30} , \u27e8k i \u27e9 = {15, 20, 25} and \u27e8k i \u27e9 = {20, 20, 20} . From Fig. 4 , we find that the increase of heterogeneity among communities makes the infectious diseases easier to break out, namely the heterogeneity among communities has negative relation with the epidemic threshold. And the epidemic prevalence of a network with greater heterogeneity among communities is larger than others, whereas the converse situation holds when the infection rate is much greater than the epidemic threshold.",

The degrees of these networks are all \u27e8k\u27e9 = 20 and the communities sizes are n 1 = n 2 = n 3 = 500. It is found that the epidemic threshold decreases with the increase of the modularity coefficient of the network, and the epidemic size of the network with higher modularity coefficient is larger around the epidemic threshold, while the inverse situation occurs when the infection rate is far greater than the threshold. It is necessary to explain that although the threshold values obtained through simulations cannot completely correspond to the threshold deduced theoretically, the relationship between the parameters of the network (especially the heterogeneity among communities H and the modularity coefficient Q ) and the propagation threshold is in accordance with the theoretical deduction. As the existence of heterogeneity among communities, the network models with same average degree of the entire network may show different modularity coefficients, and we cannot be sure whether the results of above simulations are only affected by the heterogeneity. So, we firstly investigate the relationship between heterogeneity and modularity of the community networks that was used before. In the following simulations, there are three communities in each network, and the community sizes are the same. Let the average degree of all networks be \u27e8k\u27e9 = 20. From Eq. (7), we can get the parameters (inter-and intra-community linking rate) that were used to construct the network model with given network configurations. As shown in Fig. 6 , the vertical and horizontal axes in the graph stand for heterogeneity H (see Section 2) and modularity Q respectively. The curve is obtained with heterogeneity.

In the third section, some conclusions are obtained for homogeneous community network by analyzing the proposed epidemic dynamics model and verified by some Monte Carlo simulations. Next, we construct a heterogeneous community network model considering the heterogeneity among communities, and do Monte Carlo simulations to analyze the dynamics of epidemic spreading. In the following simulations, each network contains three communities, and the community sizes are n 1 = n 2 = 0.1 and the modularity coefficient Q = 0.6 . In order to find out the impact of the location of infection source on the epidemic spreading process, we randomly chose an initial infected node from a specified community in each simulation. From these three figures, we find that the location of the infection source only affects the propagation velocity. The average degrees for three communities are shown in each figure. From Fig. 10 to Fig. 12 , the heterogeneity among communities decreases, while the corresponding epidemic prevalence increases. This is because with the increase of the heterogeneity among communities, the links between nodes become closer in some communities, while the edges of the nodes in other communities are thinning which is analogous to the situation that deleting the inner edges of most communities and adding edges only in a small number of communities, so the epidemic will be suppressed when the virus spreads to the sparse community. Fig. 13 shows the curves of epidemic threshold for each community in a heterogeneous community networks with heterogeneity among communities where the average degrees for three communities are \u27e8k i \u27e9 = {14, 26, 20} , i = 1, 2, 3, and the community coefficient Q = 0.6.

Fig. 14 shows the curves of epidemic thresholds for three networks with different heterogeneity. And Fig. 15 shows the curves , we find that the heterogeneity among communities has negative relation with the epidemic threshold, namely, the infectious diseases become easier to break out with the increase of heterogeneity among communities.

Based on this network with heterogeneity among communities, we have presented a mathematical epidemic model for each community and studied the epidemic dynamics in this network model. It has been found that community networks with different heterogeneities but the same average degree have different epidemic thresholds, and the epidemic threshold value of the entire network is between the maximum and minimum values of communities epidemic threshold. And when there is only one seed node in the network, the location of the initial infected individuals affects only the propagation velocity rather than the epidemic prevalence, while when there are multiple sources of infection in the network, the location of the sources of infection will have some influences on both the speed and prevalence of the epidemic spreading. In addition, the epidemic threshold is inversely proportional to the heterogeneity among communities. The study results are helpful to predict epidemic spreading trend more accurately and find useful strategies for controlling disease spreading.",
