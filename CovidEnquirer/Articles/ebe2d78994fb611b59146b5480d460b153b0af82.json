Literature support even suggests that metal complexes are more active than their ligands because the metal complexes serve as a vehicle for activation of the ligands as principal cytotoxic species. 16, 17 The biological aspects of metallic ligands depend upon the ease of cleaving the bond between the metal ion and the ligand. It is well known that the metals present in complexes generally accelerate the drug action and the efficacy of therapeutic agents and that the pharmacological efficiencies of drug-based metal complexes depend upon the nature of the metal ion and the ligands. 18 The present work is the continuation of our previously reported work to obtain some novel complexes where the 4-chlorophenyl and 4methoxyphenyl substituted 4-hydroxycumarin azoanalogues are conjugated with different transitional metals with an intention to produce target molecules possessing good antimicrobial properties. 3, 19 ",

The only exception is the bands due to OH str. at 3479e 3445 cm \u00c01 exhibited in the ligands that are not observable in the complexes. In metal Cu(II), Ni(II) Co(II) and Zn(II) complexes of 3a and 3b, the FT/IR absorption band due to the hydroxyl group at 4-HC has been diminished and indicates the metal co-ordination of the OH group via deprotonation due to liberation of hydrochloric acid. In addition to these FT/IR spectral data, stretching of the M\u00c0N and M\u00c0O bonds of the complexes, which appear in the higher frequency wavenumber region in the range 451e441 and 538e531 cm \u00c01 , also indicates that complexation occurred through nitrogen and oxygen atoms from the azo-enolic ligands. 22, 23 The 1 H NMR spectra of ligands 3a and 3b showed the enolic OH peak at 16.81 and 16.86 ppm. The disappearance of the enolic OH group in all the complexes (4ae4h) may be due to the interaction of metal chlorides Scheme 1: Synthesis of coumarin based transitional metal complexes. with the hydroxyl group of the ligands resulting in deprotonation and complexation of the ligands to the metal ions. Ligand 3b shows three identical, similarenvironment protons at 3.83 ppm, which indicates the presence of an eOCH 3 functional group. The good bathochromic shift at 463 and 450 nm exhibited by complexes 4a and 4e may be due to the attachment of transition metal ion Co \u00fe\u00fe to the respective ligands 3a and 3b. Most of the compounds showed good antimicrobial activity in comparison to ampicillin. The enhanced antimicrobial activity exhibited by complexes 4a, 4b, 4e and 4f relative to their ligands against E. coli may be due to coordination of Co \u00fe\u00fe and Ni \u00fe\u00fe ions to the respective ligands 3a and 3b. However, complexes 4a and 4e showed considerably enhanced antimicrobial activity against most of the pathogenic strains relative to their ligands. Complexation reduces the polarity of the metal ion by coordinating with ligands and increases the lipophilicity of the metals. 24 Thus, it facilitates the penetration of the novel synthesized complexes into the lipoid cell membrane of microorganisms and inhibits their growth. The limitations of our study include only the investigation of antimicrobial activity of the novel synthesized complexes against a few bacterial and fungal strains. Furthermore, it is necessary to investigate the antimicrobial activities of the novel complexes against multidrug-resistant microorganisms.",
