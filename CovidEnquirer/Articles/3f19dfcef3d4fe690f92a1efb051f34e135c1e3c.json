This evaluation can be accomplished by providing a form for parents to complete and bring to the initial pretravel assessment visit. Particular attention should be given to children of immigrants who are returning to their home countries to visit friends and relatives because these children have been shown to be at increased risk of many infectious diseases and may be less likely to seek pretravel advice.

For sunblock, 30 is the minimum sun protection factor (SPF) recommended for children. Sunblock should be applied 30 minutes before exposure and always before insect repellent is applied where both are needed. Adolescent travelers should be counseled regarding safer sex practices and risks of body piercing and tattooing in less developed countries. Fresh water exposure of any kind should be avoided in areas that are endemic for schistosomiasis or where Leptospira organisms can contaminate the water. Exposure to infected stool of animals or humans can result in several types of parasitic infection either directly (e.g., hookworm) or through fecal-oral exposure (e.g., Toxocara spp.). Shoes provide more protection than sandals for children exposed to contaminated environments. Animal bites can result in injury, bacterial infection at the site, or rabies; therefore, children should be cautioned to avoid unknown animals, particularly dogs, while traveling.

All references are available online at www.expertconsult.com for food and water precautions. [40] [41] [42] If exposure continues, revaccination is recommended every 2 years for the polysaccharide vaccine and every 5 years for the oral Ty21a vaccine. The Ty21a vaccine only is available in capsules in the U.S., which limits usefulness in younger children. The Ty21a vaccine must be refrigerated and taken with cool liquids approximately 1 hour before eating. The Ty21a vaccine should not be taken concurrently with the antimalarial proguanil, and antibiotics should not be used from the day before the first capsule until 7 days after completing the vaccine course. Clinical trials of a Vi conjugate vaccine demonstrating safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity in children \u22652 years of age are ongoing. 43, 44 Yellow Fever Vaccine Yellow fever vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine that may be required or recommended for travel to central South America and sub-Saharan Africa. Some countries in Africa require an international certificate of vaccination (or physician waiver letter) against yellow fever for all entering travelers; other countries may require evidence of vaccination for travelers coming from or traveling through endemic or infected areas. The vaccine is recommended for all children \u22659 months of age traveling to endemic areas. Yellow fever vaccine is effective 10 days after administration of the first dose and a booster is required every 10 years for travelers at ongoing risk. Risks and benefits of yellow fever vaccination and likelihood of infection must be considered carefully in pregnant women and people who are immunocompromised. 45 Yellow fever vaccine contains egg protein; therefore, people with previous anaphylaxis to eggs should not receive the vaccine. The vaccine is only available in the U.S. from providers certified by state health departments. 46 A yellow fever vaccine-associated encephalitis syndrome has been reported in young infants at a rate of 0.5 to 4 per 1000 infants vaccinated. 16 Neurologic symptoms occur 7 to 21 days after immunization; disease is related to reversion of vaccine virus to wildtype neurotropic virus. Consequently, the vaccine is contraindicated in infants <6 months of age. For infants 6 to 9 months of age who cannot avoid travel to a yellow fever-endemic area, consultation with an expert in the field is recommended. Yellow fever vaccineassociated viscerotropic disease, a severe systemic illness that can result in fatal organ failure, rarely has been reported.",

A dose of 10 mg/kg once daily for 3 days (maximum dose of 500 mg) is appropriate. 63 In adults a single dose of antibiotic has been shown to be as effective as 3 days' treatment; therefore, in children a full 3-day course may not be necessary. 72, 73 Fluoroquinolones for 1 to 3 days are the drug of choice for adults with travelers' diarrhea that is moderate to severe, persistent (>3 days), or associated with fever or bloody stools. Although there are concerns regarding the potential for development of arthropathy and antimicrobial resistance with fluoroquinolone use in children, the U.S. FDA has approved ciprofloxacin for anthrax and as a second-line agent for the treatment of urinary tract infections in children from 1 through 17 years of age. 74, 75 Therefore, fluoroquinolones could be considered safe in children for the short course required for travelers' diarrhea. A 1-to 3-day course of ciprofloxacin at a dose of 20 to 30 mg/kg per day divided twice daily with a maximum dose of 500 mg bid is recommended for children with moderate to severe or bloody diarrhea. 63 Rifaximin (Xifaxan), a nonabsorbed rifamycin derivative, has been approved in the U.S. for treatment and prevention of travelers' diarrhea for people \u226512 years of age. 76 A liquid preparation is available in some countries for pediatric use.

Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) using a homemade or commercially prepared oral rehydration solution (ORS) can be used to prevent dehydration associated with diarrheal disease. Commercial ORS should be used to treat mild to moderate dehydration; severe dehydration may require intravenous fluid resuscitation. 68, 69 ORS packets should be part of a family's travel medical kit. Locally made preparations can be used early in therapy, although they differ in composition from the reduced-osmolarity ORS recommended by WHO (Table  8-3) . 68, 69 Breastfeeding should be continued in infants, and solid food intake should be maintained along with rehydration with ORT throughout the diarrheal episode, although foods high in simple sugars should be avoided because the increased osmotic load may worsen fluid losses.",

Children who develop fever after travel should seek immediate medical attention, and parents must inform the physicians caring for them of their travel itinerary. This is particularly critical if the itinerary has included a malaria-endemic area, since chemoprophylaxis cannot prevent all cases of malaria. Because malaria can manifest with nonspecific symptoms in children, any symptoms of fever, rigors, headache, malaise, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, poor feeding, or cough following travel to an endemic country should be evaluated promptly by a physician. 82, 83 Travel-related illness has been shown to be highly dependent on itinerary.
