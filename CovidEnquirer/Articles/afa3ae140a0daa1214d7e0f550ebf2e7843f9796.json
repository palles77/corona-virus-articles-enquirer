            "text": "A severe, sometimes fatal respiratory disease has been observed in captive ball pythons (Python regius) since the late 1990s. In order to better understand this disease and its etiology, we collected case and control samples and performed pathological and diagnostic analyses. Electron micrographs revealed filamentous virus-like particles in lung epithelial cells of sick animals. Diagnostic testing for known pathogens did not identify an etiologic agent, so unbiased metagenomic sequencing was performed. Abundant nidovirus-like sequences were identified in cases and were used to assemble the genome of a previously unknown virus in the order Nidovirales. The nidoviruses, which were not previously known to infect nonavian reptiles, are a diverse order that includes important human and veterinary pathogens. The presence of the viral RNA was confirmed in all diseased animals (n \u202b\u060d\u202c 8) but was not detected in healthy pythons or other snakes (n \u202b\u060d\u202c 57). Viral RNA levels were generally highest in the lung and other respiratory tract tissues. The 33.5-kb viral genome is the largest RNA genome yet described and shares canonical characteristics with other nidovirus genomes, although several features distinguish this from related viruses. This virus, which we named ball python nidovirus (BPNV), will likely establish a new genus in Torovirinae subfamily. The identification of a novel nidovirus in reptiles contributes to our understanding of the biology and evolution of related viruses, and its association with lung disease in pythons is a promising step toward elucidating an etiology for this long-standing veterinary disease. IMPORTANCE Ball pythons are popular pets because of their diverse coloration, generally nonaggressive behavior, and relatively small size. Since the 1990s, veterinarians have been aware of an infectious respiratory disease of unknown cause in ball pythons that can be fatal. We used unbiased shotgun sequencing to discover a novel virus in the order Nidovirales that was present in cases but not controls. While nidoviruses are known to infect a variety of animals, this is the first report of a nidovirus recovered from any reptile. This report will enable diagnostics that will assist in determining the role of this virus in the causation of disease, which would allow control of the disease in zoos and private collections. Given its evolutionary divergence from known nidoviruses and its unique host, the study of reptile nidoviruses may further our understanding of related diseases and the viruses that cause them in humans and other animals.

Hyperplastic alveolar cells completely proliferated over capillary beds that are normally distributed at the surface of the primitive faveoli ( Fig. 2C and D) . Epithelial cells were tall and columnar with abun- dant apical mucus production (mucous metaplasia). Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and alcian blue staining were positive, consistent with the presence of mucopolysaccharides.

In deeper areas of the faveolar spaces, the lung was histologically normal. In more severe cases, the proliferative changes occurred diffusely throughout the lung and were seen from the proximal to distal surfaces lining faveolar structures. Three snakes had mild to marked bronchial epithelial hyperplasia, with mild to moderate smooth muscle hypertrophy of the terminal muscle bundles. In these cases, the bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue was mildly to moderately hyperplastic. Sections of lungs of two cases were stained with Warthin-Starry stain and Brown-Hopps Gram stain; there was no positive staining for bac-teria between cilia and microvilli of pneumocytes overlying muscle bundles. Three of five nasal cavities that were examined revealed mild subacute rhinitis/sinusitis. The vomeronasal organ in one snake was almost obliterated by foamy macrophages. Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast staining was negative for acid-fast bacteria, and methenamine silver staining was negative for yeast and hyphae. Three cases had mild to moderate stomatitis/pharyngitis.

These particles were observed within ciliated and mucous epithelial cells overlying smooth muscle bundles at the tips of faveolar septa and alveolar type II cells lining faveolar spaces of both snakes (Fig. 3A) . The particles corresponded to stages of a virus with both circular and bacillary (elongated rod-shaped) nucleocapsids and were seen within electron-lucent areas of the cytoplasm. At a higher magnification, bacillary nucleocapsids contained a lucent core that was surrounded by fine granular cytoplasmic material (Fig. 3B) . The uncoated intracellular capsids measured 10 to 12 nm. Nucleocapsids lined up along membranes of cytoplasmic vesicles of uncertain origin, and as they progressed into a vesicle, a membrane coat was acquired (Fig. 3C ). Cross sections of mature virions having a lipid envelope and surface spikes were also identified in cytoplasmic vesicles (Fig. 3D ). Bacillary virions were observed within vesicles subadjacent to epithelial cell membranes on the free cell surface (Fig. 3E ) and extracellularly between cilia and microvilli projecting into the air passageway (Fig. 3F) .

The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument to an average depth of 2.9 million pairs of 100-nucleotide (nt) sequences per sample (see Table S2 in the supplemental material). We then used a stepwise analysis pipeline to efficiently identify possible pathogen-derived sequences. First, we removed low-quality and low-complexity sequences and trimmed adapter sequences from reads. For each library, identical reads were collapsed to yield sets of unique sequences. Next, we filtered out snake ribosomal sequences and sequences aligning to the Burmese python and boa constrictor genomes (20, 21) .

The data set from snake 2 had the most nidovirus-like sequences: 92 read pairs with BLASTx alignments to nidovirus protein sequences with an expect (E) value of \u054510 \u03ea3 (see Table S2 in the supplemental material). These sequences were used to seed targeted de novo genome assembly using the PRICE metagenomic assembler (22) , which produced a draft assembly of what appeared to be the complete viral genome of 34.5 kb (Fig. 4A ). Sanger sequencing of the entire genome and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) were used to validate the assembly and to confirm that it contained the proper end sequences (Fig. 4B ) (23) (24) (25) . We used the Bowtie2 software alignment tool to retrospectively map paired-end reads to the draft genome assembly and found it to be well supported by deep sequencing data (26, 27) . Coverage levels were even across the genome, and read pairs generally mapped concordantly ( Fig. 4C and D) .

We used the BLASTp alignment tool to search for similar sequences in the NCBI nonredundant protein database (nr) (30) . We also used the more sensitive HMMER3 and HH-PRED hidden Markov model-based alignment and structure prediction software tools to detect more distant homologies and identify functional domains within the replicase polyprotein (31, 32) (http://hmmer.org).

ORF1a is translated to produce the pp1a polyprotein. A fraction of translating ribosomes undergo a \u03ea1 frameshift near the end of ORF1a, resulting in the continuation of translation though ORF1b and the production of the pp1ab polyprotein. This virus is likely to utilize a similar mechanism of translation. ORF1a and ORF1b are offset by a \u03ea1 frame difference and overlap by 52 nt. This overlapping region contains a putative \"slippery\" sequence (AAAAAAC) that may be the site of frameshifting ( Fig. 4A ; see also Fig. S2 in the supplemental material) (35, 36) . In this virus, pp1a is predicted to be a 5,803-amino-acid (aa) protein with a molecular mass of 663 kDa, and pp1ab is predicted to be 8,108 residues long with a mass of 925 kDa (Fig. 4E) .

The best alignments produced were to pp1ab sequences from viruses in the Torovirinae subfamily, with bafinivirus sequences producing slightly higher scoring alignments than did torovirus sequences. The best alignment was to the pp1ab sequence of fathead minnow nidovirus (FHMNV) (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material) (40) . This alignment covered nearly the entire second half of pp1ab in 2 contiguous pieces from residues 3973 to 5060 and 5429 to 8029 of snake virus pp1ab. In these regions, the polyproteins shared 22% and 29% pairwise identities, respectively.

Second, the protein contains 3 predicted TM domains in the N-terminal half, a characteristic feature (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material).

Data sets contained retrovirus-like sequences most similar to that of Python molurus endogenous retrovirus (ERV) sequences (56) . These were present in nearly every case and control Python regius data set and most likely de- rived from ball python ERVs. Also, as with all metagenomic data sets from nonsterile sites, bacterial sequences were present. However, no particular bacterial taxon was associated with cases, in contrast to the nidovirus sequences, which were perfectly associated. Nevertheless, from these sequencing data sets alone, it is not possible to formally rule out a role in disease causality by other viral or bacterial pathogens. We next sought to determine the distribution of viral load within the tissues of individual infected snakes. Frozen samples from multiple tissues were available for 4 snakes. We extracted RNA from these tissues and used qRT-PCR to quantify viral RNA relative to expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA (Fig. 6B) . Consistent with the pathology observed, viral load was consistently highest in respiratory tract tissue. Viral RNA levels were at approximately the same level in intestine-derived RNA from the single snake for which this tissue was available (no. 11), a finding consistent with respiratory/enteric tropism of many viruses in the Coronaviridae family (7, 8) . Viral RNA was also detectable in other tissues (liver, kidney, heart, spleen, and brain) at levels that were 3 to 5 orders of magnitude lower than in the lung. While these results support the notion that the respiratory tract is the primary location of viral replication, consistent with the disease pathology, additional systematic collection and analysis of samples from diseased animals will be necessary to definitively characterize tissue tropism for this virus.",

Bayesian and maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenies based on individual domain and concatenated alignments had nearly identical topologies ( Fig. 7 ; see also Fig. S6 ). In these phylogenies, the 5 major groups of nidoviruses (Torovirinae, Coronavirinae, Roniviridae, Mesoniviridae, and Arteriviridae) formed well-separated branches. Ball python nidovirus (BPNV) formed a monophyletic clade with the viruses in the Torovirinae subfamily of the Coronaviridae family. The snake virus is approximately equally distant from the two genera in the subfamily, the toroviruses, which infect mammals, and the bafiniviruses, which infect ray-finned fish ( Fig. 7 ; see also Fig. S6 ). We noted in the protease alignment that two putative active site motifs previously identified by Ulferts et al. (57) , one containing a histidine and a GX[S/C] G motif, aligned in all sequences. A third putative Asp/Glu-containing motif shifted drastically in alignments, even within Coronavirinae. Nevertheless, the topology of the tree generated using the protease alignment was in close agreement with other phylogenies. This analysis did not find a monophyletic grouping of the Torovirinae and Coronavirinae subfamilies of the family Coronaviridae.

We collected cases from around the United States and performed a variety of pathological and diagnostic analyses. Respiratory tract pathology was consistent with a viral etiology, as was the presence of virus-like particles in lung epithelium of affected snakes. Using unbiased deep sequencing, we identified and assembled the genome of a previously uncharacterized nidovirus. This virus shares several attributes with other nidoviruses but has several distinguishing characteristics, including its record-setting genome size and reptile host. The findings presented here raise a number of questions related to the biology of this virus and its relationship to disease. Foremost among these is whether this virus causes the observed respiratory pathology. Several observations suggest a causal relationship. First, detection of viral RNA correlates with clinical signs. Second, the virus load is most profound in the respiratory tract, the site of disease. Third, other animal nidoviruses cause severe respiratory disease. Nevertheless, formal evidence of disease causality remains to be demonstrated. Although virus isolation attempts have yet to succeed, experimental infections using material prepared directly from infected tissues could fulfill Koch's postulates.",

This suggests that at least for the core replicase gene, the snake virus shares a common evolutionary origin with these mammal and fish viruses. Although it has not been proven that the virus sequence corresponds to the particles observed in electron micrographs, the ultrastructural appearance and size of the observed virus are notably similar to those of virions of white bream virus in the genus Bafinivirus (61, 62) .

It is also possible that these practices select for increased virulence, as has been the case for feline calicivirus (FCV), which has independently evolved multiple times from a pathogen that causes a relatively benign upper respiratory disease to one that causes hemorrhagic disease with high mortality (69) . This increase in FCV virulence has been documented only in high-density environments, such as shelters. Surveillance of wild ball pythons in Africa will shed light on whether a similar phenomenon has occurred here. Further investigation of the pathogens of reptiles and improved biosecurity practices and disease surveillance of the herpetoculture industry are indicated.",

The precise host range of this virus remains undefined. It is not clear that ball pythons are the primary natural host for this virus, nor whether it can replicate or cause disease in other snakes, other reptiles, or other animals. The routes of transmission for this virus remain unknown. Additionally, the prevalence of this disease is yet to be determined, although it is apparently widespread, since cases were collected from geographically disparate locations in the United States from 2006 to 2013. Additional studies will help to answer these central questions and uncover additional details about the biology of this putative pathogen. The current study is another example where the application of genomic techniques to the study of infectious disease in reptiles and other less well studied organisms has identified new and unexpected relatives of human pathogens (59, 70) .",

Low-quality sequences and low-complexity sequences (defined as having a ratio of the length of the Lempel-Ziv-Welch compressed sequence to the uncompressed length of less than 0.46) were removed from further analysis. The first 5 bases of each sequence were trimmed, as was the last base. The CD-HIT sequence clustering tool was then used to collapse reads with \u03fe98% global pairwise identity (77) . Host-derived sequences were then filtered, first by using the BLASTn alignment tool (version 2.2.25\u03e9 [30] ) to query a database of snake ribosomal and mitochondrial sequences and then by using the Bowtie2 alignment tool (version 2.0.0-beta7 [26] ) to query databases composed of draft assemblies of the Burmese python and boa constrictor genomes (20, 21) . Sequences aligning with an expect value of less than 10 \u03ea12 (BLASTn) or with -local mode alignment scores greater than 86 (Bowtie) were filtered. Similarly, sequences that aligned to the Illumina adapter sequences (see Table S1 in the supplemental material) or to PhiX-174 control sequence were removed. This filtering removed on average 98% of sequences (see Table S2 ). The remaining sequences were searched against custom databases of viral protein sequences using the BLASTx alignment tool. Sequences aligning to any viral protein sequence with an expect value of less than 0.25 were further examined. False positives were reduced by using BLAST to align putative viral sequences to the NCBI nonredundant nucleotide (nt) and protein (nr) databases. Only sequences whose best hit and whose pair's best hit were still to viral sequences were retained. The PRICE de novo targeted genome assembler was used to generate initial contiguous virus sequences (22) . The reference assembly (NCBI accession no. KJ541759) was assembled using reads from a single snake (no. 2); other animals lacked sufficient coverage to assemble the complete genome. To validate this assembly and generate coverage and pairwise identity data, reads were aligned to Sanger validated assemblies using the BLASTn algorithm. Sequencing data have been deposited in the UCSF Integrated Data Repository.",
