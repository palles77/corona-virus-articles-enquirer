Recent studies on human medicine report that gut microbiota is involved in the development of systemic disorders and could influence the immune response to viral diseases. The aim of this study was to provide preliminary data on the fecal microbiota composition in healthy cats compared to FCoV-infected cats, with and without FIP. Cats were equally grouped as healthy FCoV-negative, healthy FCoV-positive or FIP affected (total n = 15). Fecal sample were evaluated for the microbiota composition. A total of 3,231,916 sequences were analyzed. The samples' alpha-diversity curves did not reach a proper plateau and, for the beta-diversity, the samples seemed not to group perfectly by category, even if the healthy FCoV-positive group showed a hybrid microbial composition between FCoV-negative and FIP groups. Although there were no taxa significantly linked to the different conditions, some peculiar patterns were recognized: Firmicutes was always the most represented phylum, followed by Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. In FCoV-positive cats, the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were respectively over-and under-represented, compared to the other groups. Among FIP cats, three subjects shared a similar microbiome, one cat showed a different microbial profile and the other one had the lowest number of diverse phyla. Despite the limited number of animals, some differences in the fecal microbiome between the groups were observed, suggesting to further investigate the possible correlation between gut microbiota and FCoV infection in cats.",

            "text": "One topic of great interest in the last few years has been the evaluation of intestinal microbiota, which is the consortium of all living microorganisms that inhabit the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This new insight into the complexity of the intestinal microbiota, by the use of next generation sequencing techniques, and its intimate relationship with the host has spurred researchers to better understand the importance of a balanced microbial ecosystem for the regulation of host health and immunity (Suchodolski, 2016) . In the last few years molecular methods, mostly targeting the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (16S rRNA), have been used for identification of bacterial microbiota. This gene is ubiquitously present in all bacteria and archaea and contains both conserved and variable sequence regions, enabling researchers to distinguish organisms at different phylogenetic levels. Such approach has demonstrated that the gastrointestinal tract of both human and animals harbors a highly complex microbial ecosystem, consisting of several hundreds of different bacterial phylotypes (Handl et al., 2011) . The importance of microbiota for the host is highlighted by murine studies that clearly indicate a reciprocal regulation between microbiota and T cell development (Williams et al., 2006; Round and Mazmanian, 2009; Lopes et al., 2016) . In human medicine, variations of the gut microbiota have been correlated not only with gastrointestinal diseases (Frank et al., 2007) , but also with obesity (Ley et al., 2005) , allergies, autoimmune (Vieira et al., 2014; Block et al., 2016) and infectious diseases (Goedert, 2016; Tincati et al., 2016) .",

            "text": "Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) is a systemic fatal disease affecting mostly young cats (Pedersen, 2014a) sustained by the feline coronavirus (FCoV), which commonly occurs in multicat environments. The FCoVs usually inhabit the intestinal tract (feline enteric coronavirus, FECV). During viral replication within the enterocyte, a mutated variant, also called FIP virus (FIPV) may be generated (Pedersen, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2019.07.003 Received 28 February 2019; Received in revised form 4 July 2019; Accepted 9 July 2019 T 2014a). Whichever is the exact mutation, FIPV loses tropism for enterocytes and gains the capability to replicate inside macrophages (Kipar et al., 2010) . Moreover, FCoV induces macrophage-monocyte proliferation in haemo-lymphatic tissues and thus allow a progressive viral adaptation to the replication within these cells (Kipar and Meli, 2014) . Although both viral biotypes (FECV and FIPV) can spread systemically, only the FIPV may induce FIP, due to the higher rate of interactions between the virus and monocytes. Moreover, the host immune response has a pivotal role in the development of the disease. Indeed, the cell-mediated immunity seems to be protective. On the other hand, it is known that the humoral response induces development of antibodies that enhance the in vitro virus uptake in macrophages and this, in turn, contributes in vivo to the development of the clinical signs seen during the effusive (wet) form of the disease. The non-effusive (dry) form is considered as an intermediate status involving a partially effective cellular response (Pedersen, 2014a) .",

However, results were not comparable with our findings because of the different pathogenic role of FCoV compared to TGEV, as FECV infection is usually asymptomatic, and because of the different diet and bacterial phylotypes observed in swine compared to cats. In contrast to what was previously reported for cats (Weese et al., 2015) , our results showed a low abundance of Proteobacteria. In humans, increase in Proteobacteria relative abundance is associated with \"dysbiosis\" and gastrointestinal symptoms (Kaakoush et al., 2012; Suchodolski et al., 2012; Shin et al., 2015) .
