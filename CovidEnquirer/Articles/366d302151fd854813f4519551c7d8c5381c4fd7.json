The owner, a veterinary technician, worked for a veterinarian who systematically pursued an infectious disease diagnosis, in association with acute-onset lethargy and febrile illness. Addition ally, there was consistency in preventive healthcare (vaccines and parasiticides), diagnostic testing, and the dose and duration of azithromycin administration. BAPGM enrichment blood culture/PCR followed by DNA sequencing documented B henselae infection in cases 2 and 3 at illness onset and at the time of case 2's fever recrudescence, whereas case 1 initially tested PCR negative. Two possibilities for the negative BAPGM enrichment blood culture/PCR results seem most likely. Following experimental blood transfusion transmission of B henselae to cats, Kordick and Breitschwerdt documented prolonged periods of abacteremia (weeks to months) in some cats. 4 Thus, it is possible that case 1 did not have circulating B henselae organisms at the time of specimen collections in September 2012. Alternatively, case 1 could have been infected by a flea, unknowingly introduced into the household, following case 3's adoption in August 2012. This possibility could explain the negative WB results, the negative PCR results and the subsequent PCR positive results and documentation of seroconversion by WB. Based upon 16S-23S ITS DNA sequence alignments, all three kittens were initially infected with the same B henselae genotype.",

Diagnostically, there were no consistent hematological, biochemical or urinalysis abnormalities, despite acuteonset febrile illness; however, case 2 was initially mildly anemic and had neutrophilia but was neutropenic when febrile illness reoccurred. The neutropenia in these two cats may have been related to B henselae infection or infection with another organism that was not tested for diagnostically. Unique sequential temperature data in case 1 documented a fluctuating, relapsing febrile pattern prior to illness onset.",

Importantly, the onset of illness in cases 1 and 2 occurred months after presumptive flea transmission of B henselae, but shortly after the introduction of case 3. It is possible that fleas were unknowingly introduced into the household with case 3. In the context of disease causation, immediately following administration of azithromycin, all three cases became afebrile, supporting a diagnosis ex juvantibus ('from that which helps'; medical definition: 'a response to a narrow, specific therapy that strengthens the association with a suspected etiology'). Although B henselae bacteremia was documented in all three cats in conjunction with resolution of clinical signs following initiation of antibiotic therapy, it is possible that this response was related to another infectious agent (co-infection), or that spontaneous resolution of clinical signs occurred independently of antibiotic administration. However, based upon the results of this study and others published previously, 4-9 B henselae may be an underestimated cause of fever of unknown origin in flea-exposed cats, particularly those with immature or naive immune systems.",

Experimentally, the route of infection (intravenous or subcutaneous) and inoculum (culture grown, blood transfusion or flea transmission) substantially influence the duration and patterns of bacteremia (relapsing or non-relapsing), whether clinical signs were observed and, in those studies in which cats were necropsied, whether pathological lesions were found. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Owing to the high seroprevalences among cats in flea-endemic regions, seroepidemiological studies have, for the most part, not found statistical associations between B henselae seroreactivity and disease manifestations. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] However, Whittemore et al found a correlation between Bartonella species antibodies and hypergammaglobulinemia in cats. 22 Sykes et al found an association between gingivitis and stomatitis and culturing Bartonella species from bacteremic cats, whereas there was no statistical difference in seroprevalence between cases and controls. 21 Also, a study from Switzerland, where the overall B henselae seroprevalence in 728 cats was low (8.3%) compared with many regions in North America where cat population seroprevalences are >40%, found a statistical correlation between seroreactivity and stomatitis. 23 Collectively, these and other published studies serve to illustrate the evolutionary adaptation of most B henselae strains among cats as a natural reservoir host and the inherent difficulty in establishing disease correlations.",

One might speculate that virulence differences, in conjunction with the robustness of the host immune response, determine the extent to which a B henselae genotype induces disease. For example, the CSU-1 strain, originally isolated from a shelter cat in Florida and used experimentally by Bradbury and Lappin in flea transmission studies, has induced acute myocarditis in young experimentally infected cats. 9 Other feline experimental infection studies have also provided evidence to support virulence differences among B henselae strains. 4, 9 Granulomatous myocarditis was reported in young, naturally flea-infested cats, by direct bacterial visualization and PCR amplification of B henselae from the myocardial lesions. 28 Thus, future fieldbased studies designed to address disease causation should incorporate bacterial isolation, B henselae genotyping, sequential serological testing, an enrichment culture/PCR approach to enhance the sensitivity of documenting infection with one or more Bartonella species and documentation of each cat's clinical response to a defined antibiotic treatment regimen.",

Also, WB titration results from case 3 were not informative for establishing antibiotic treatment failure. As cats (an unknown percentage), dogs (50-75% depending upon infecting Bartonella species), 32 horses (100%) 32 and humans (approximately 50-100% depending upon infecting Bartonella species) 33,34 can be Bartonella bacteremic without detectable IFAs, IFA serology has substantial lack of sensitivity across several animal species. Similarly, case 1 was initially WB negative despite documentation of bacteremia, whereas case 2 was not initially treated (owing to lack of illness), despite being WB positive. As a result of stress-induced interference with premonition (infection immunity), one might speculate that hospitalization and castration contributed to the onset of febrile illness in cases 1 and 2, 10-21 days later. At the time of illness onset and at the time of recrudescent febrile illness, case 2 was BAPGM blood culture/PCR positive. Also, in order to determine antimicrobial susceptibility and resistance patterns, it is important for diagnostic laboratories to culture Bartonella species from cats and other animals whenever possible.",

However, we recommend that follow-up serology and enrichment culture/PCR testing be considered to confirm therapeutic elimination of the infection. Post-treatment decreases in antibody levels seem to support elimination of infection in dogs. 42 However, in a dog experimentally infected with B henselae, IFAs were no longer detectable after administration of corticosteroids (no antibiotic treatment administered), yet B henselae was isolated from the bone marrow. 43 Based upon human case experiences, obtaining three specimens for enrichment blood culture/PCR within a 7 day period increased sensitivity of Bartonella species detection (odds ratio 3.4; P = 0.02), 44 and in no instance was a patient enrichment culture/PCR positive in all three specimens and only 3/12 patients were positive for two specimens. This finding, potentially related to a relapsing bacteremia as reported in cats, 4 indicates that diagnostic confirmation and subsequently proving therapeutic elimination of bartonellosis remains clinically and diagnostically challenging. Until additional studies define an optimal treatment regimen for feline bartonellosis, combination therapy is recommended for culture or PCR confirmed cases. As optimal treatment regimens, including dual therapy, are not proven to eliminate Bartonella species bacteremia in cats, it is important to attempt to lessen potential transmission by maintaining stringent flea control. 8, 9 Conclusions We conclude that B henselae causes acute febrile illness in cats that resolves in conjunction with antibiotic therapy, which may or may not represent elimination of infection. Neutropenia may be an accompanying haematological abnormality in a subset of cats with bartonellosis. Additional laboratory and field studies are needed to define optimal treatment regimens and optimal followup testing procedures for cats with bartonellosis.",

Western immunoblot (WB), PCR, Bartonella alpha Proteobacteria growth medium (BAPGM) blood culture/PCR/DNA sequencing results and post-treatment Western blot antibody titration titers for three febrile Bartonella henselae-infected kittens Azithromycin suspension (40 mg/cc, 10 mg/kg/day) was administered orally for 21 days. Temperature, behavior and food intake normalized within 24 h. Aural temperatures remained normal for the next 30 days (Figure 2). On 12 November 2012, WB documented seroconversion. Six months later (7 May 2013), WB titration documented a 16-fold decrease in the titer of B henselae antibodies. Despite remaining healthy, B henselae DNA was again PCR amplified and sequenced from a BAPGM enrichment blood culture obtained on 28 August 2014, and WB titration indicated no decrease in antibodies, whereas a B henselae IFA titer (Vector Borne Disease Diagnostic Laboratory) was <1:16. During the examinations of 15 June and 21 August 2012, case 2, presumably case 1's littermate, was vaccinated, treated and tested identically. A B henselae WB was positive. There were no intra-or immediate postoperative complications. The owner was instructed to monitor and measure aural temperature if signs of illness occurred. Anorexia, lethargy and fever (40.0\u00b0C) developed 10 days postcastration. Laboratory abnormalities (ANTECH Diagnostics; 6 September 2012) included normocytic, normochromic anemia (hematocrit 26.1% [RI 29-48%], hemoglobin 8.2 g/dl [RI 9.3-15.9 g/dl]) and neutrophilia (12,456/\u00b5l [RI 2500-8500/\u00b5l]). B henselae DNA was amplified (Galaxy Diagnostics) and sequenced (GENEWIZ, Research Triangle Park, NC) from three BAPGM enrichment blood cultures. Azithromycin suspension (40 mg/cc, 10 mg/kg/day) was administered orally for 21 days. Temperature and food intake normalized within 24 h.",
