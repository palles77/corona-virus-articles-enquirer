The stresses were rehousing with the addition of n.r-free contact birds, corticosteroid treatment and the onset of lay. The contact birds were also monitored for transmission of the virus from the carrier birds. Rehousing with unfamiliar birds induced II.T virus shedding in one of five birds and there was evidence of transmission from this bird to its mate. The onset of lay had a significant effect on the overall shedding rates of the carrier birds. Nine of 10 birds shed virus after onset of lay compared with only two in the three-and-a-half weeks before, and there was a highly significant increase (P<O'OOl) in the overall number of virus isolations during this period. Corticosteroid treatment did not affect virus shedding. These results may explain some of the apparently spontaneous outbreaks of n.r which occur in the field.",

More recently the carrier state was demonstrated in over 80 per cent of live clinically recovered birds by tracheal swabbing (Hughes and others 1987) .

The possibility of virus transmission to the uninfected birds was also investigated. Five specific pathogen free (ser) cockerels (Jones and Jordan 1972) ,22 months old, were used. They had been infected with field strain 216 of ILT virus at 12 weeks old and had shed virus for up to eight days during the acute phase (Hughes and others 1987) . No virus was detected in any bird after this time until nine weeks after infection, when intermittent shedding was demonstrated in four of the five birds. These four were then considered as carriers (birds I to 4, Table I ). Tracheal swabs were taken daily from all birds IO days before rehousing to ensure that virus shedding was not already occurring and to act as a control for the effect of swabbing. On day II the cockerels were bled and serum neutralisation titres ranged from 1/3 to >1/32 (Table I) . The birds were then removed separately from their communal cages, transferred to another building and put into individual cages (I m 2 ) within fibreglass isolators each containing an uninfected SPF hen of similar age. A control uninfected cockerel was treated similarly. All birds were swabbed daily for three weeks and then on alternate days until day 41. Attempted virus isolation from the swabs was carried out in chick embryo liver cells for up to three passages (Hughes and Jones 1988) .",

            "text": "It appears from these studies that the 'nat ural' stress of rehousing and, or, the addition of a contact bird, and also the onset of lay may increase the shedding rate in the ILT virus carrier. In the rehousing experiment, although no virus shedding was detected in the 10 days before rehousing, one of the five birds started shedding five days after rehousing, and continued for a further five days. Although numbers were very small, both the re-excretion rate and pattern of shedding was similar to that seen with felid herpesvirus I (FHV I) Povey 1977, Goddard 1984) . It was interesting that the bird that did shed was the only one that had not been detected as having shed previously since the acute disease. In this context, Gaskell and Povey (1977) noted that a refractory period appeared to exist after an episode of re-excretion of FHV I, when a further episode is less likely to occur. In this study this may also be why corticosteroid at the dosage used appeared to be ineffective in inducing re-excretion, despite being highly effective in some mammalian herpesvirus infections, eg, in cattle, horses and cats (Sheffy and Davies 1972 , Gaskell and Povey 1977 , Edington and others 1985 . However, it may be that the mechanism of either reactivation or its control is different in the domestic fowl. The transmission studies were inconclusive. Only bird 5 appeared to transmit virus to its mate, and this bird was positive for one day only and had not developed detectable serum neutral ising antibodies to ILT virus, on the single occasion tested. Subsequent testing by ELISA was also negative (Adair and others 1985) . It is possible that the swabbing method was not sensitive enough to pick up very small virus concentrations on other days, or perhaps the infection was very transient and localised which may also explain the lack of detectable antibodies. Another explanation may be that the pairs of birds were in too large a cage; Gaskell and Povey (1982) found that FHV I transmission between cats did not occur unless they were maintained in very close contact.",

Nine of the 10 birds shed virus after onset of lay compared with only two in the three-and-a-half weeks before, and there was a highly significant increase in the overall number of virus isolations during this period. Although spontaneous, intermittent shedding was shown in latent ILT infection in cockerels in a previous experiment it was generally at a lower frequency (Hughes and others 1987) . However, the birds in this previous study were also approaching sexual maturity and may have been subject to similar hormonal influences. The possibility of contact reinfection in the present study should also be considered as the birds were not totally isolated from each other.",

Reexcreted virus could be present in greater concentrations and for longer periods of time than in the experimental conditions used here and also the commercial birds would be housed at a higher density than the experimental birds.
