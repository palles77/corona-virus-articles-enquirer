Other rare viruses and diseases include West Nile virus, herpesviruses, parvovirus B19, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and severe acute respiratory syndrome. Current standard testing does not detect these infections; nevertheless, viral transmission via blood components is very rare. 3, 4 The blood groups routinely tested for donors and recipients are the ABO and Rh systems. The ABO blood group is determined because anti-A and/or anti-B immunoglobulin M (IgM) alloantibodies in the recipient's serum produce rapid hemolysis of donor red cells. Commercially available anti-A and anti-B antibodies are used to determine ABO blood type. These IgM molecules bind to A group and B group red cell antigens, respectively, producing direct (macroscopic) agglutination. Moreover, incubating the recipient's serum with commercially available group A and group B red cells demonstrates the presence of specifi c alloantibodies, confi rming the ABO blood type. For example, blood type A shows the recipient's red cell agglutination with commercial anti-A antibodies and commercial group A red cell agglutination with the recipient's serum. Commercially available (modifi ed) anti-Rh immunoglobulin G (IgG) can directly agglutinate (macroscopically visible) D-positive (or Rh 0 ) red blood cells.",

Allo-versus autoantibodies are determined by a commercially available panel of red cells, varying with antigen phenotype. Agglutination of all red cell panels indicates autoantibodies (e.g., patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia).

Units are prepared from whole blood by removing most of the plasma (producing an average hematocrit value of 70%). This procedure reduces the transfusion volume and the isoagglutinin load. Each unit usually contains approximately 200 ml of RBCs, 70 ml of plasma, and 100 ml of additive nutrient solution (e.g., citrate [as an anticoagulant], phosphate, dextrose, and ATP). Clinical citrate toxicity (hypocalcemia due to calcium chelation) is rare, occurring only with massive transfusions (e.g., exchange transfusion), and responds to calcium supplements. Prolonged storage produces a leakage of potassium into the plasma, which is usually clinically insignifi cant. Blood should be infused through a fi lter (170 to 260 \u00b5m) to remove debris caused by storage. 1, 2 Transfusion is usually given if the symptoms of anemia or blood loss are severe and further delay might result in signifi cant disability or death. Selected indications for transfusion include acute bleeding, high-dose chemotherapy, severe prematurity, sickle cell disease (e.g., splenic sequestration, severe acute chest syndrome), thalassemia major, aplastic anemia, pure red cell aplasia, and severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia (using the most compatible unit). 2 Transfusing 10 to 15 ml/kg of PRBCs in a child raises the hemoglobin concentration by 2 to 3 g/dl and the hematocrit by 6% to 9% (Table 132-2) . 1, 5 Transfusion is usually given at 15 ml/kg over 2 to 4 hours. Faster transfusion may be necessary to replace acute blood loss. If the intention is to transfuse small amounts (e.g., in infants), a unit can be divided into several aliquots.",

Moreover, life-threatening hemorrhage (e.g., into the airway, lungs, central nervous system, and gastrointestinal tract) becomes more likely when the platelet count is 5000/mm 3 or less. Thus profound thrombocytopenia (defi ned as a platelet count < 20,000/mm 3 ) due to decreased production (e.g., patients on chemotherapy or with aplastic anemia) should be promptly treated with platelet transfusion. A prophylactic transfusion is recommended when the platelet count is less than 20,000/mm 3 . A therapeutic transfusion, in contrast, is given to treat any signifi cant bleeding even if the platelet count is greater than 20,000/mm 3 . 2 Platelet concentrates are prepared from routinely donated whole blood by centrifugation, producing platelet-rich plasma that, on further centrifugation and separation of the supernatant plasma, yields a platelet concentrate (unit) of 50 ml.

This procedure preserves the activities of labile proteins, such as factors V and VII. It is a nonconcentrated source of clotting factors and is used for acquired coagulopathy (e.g., liver disease and disseminated intravascular coagulation), rapid reversal of warfarin, congenital coagulation factor defi ciency (e.g., factors II, X, XI, XIII), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (see Chapter 129, Acute Childhood Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura and Related Platelet Disorders; and Chapter 131, Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome). The dose ranges from 10 to 25 ml/kg, repeated as necessary (see Table 132 -2). 5 The product should be ABO compatible. Potential complications include viral transmission (e.g., HIV, hepatitis), anaphylactic reaction, urticaria, and alloimmunization. Because of the risk of viral transmission, FFP should be used only if absolutely necessary. Cryoprecipitate is prepared from FFP by thawing at 4\u00b0 C. The precipitate is then suspended in 15 ml plasma and refrozen at less than 18\u00b0 C. It is rich in fi brinogen (each unit contains approximately 250 mg), factor VIII, and von Willebrand's factor. It is used to treat bleeding due to fi brinogen defi ciency, such as severe liver disease, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and afi brinogenemia (rare). The recommended dose is 1 to 4 units (bags) per 10 kg (8 to 12 units for adults), which raises plasma fi brinogen to by 60 to 100 mg/dl (see Table 132 -2). 5 Due to the risk of viral transmission and availability of safer products, cryoprecipitate should not be used to treat patients with hemophilia A or von Willebrand's disease.",
