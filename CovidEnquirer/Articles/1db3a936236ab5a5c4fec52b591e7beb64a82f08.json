Their name refers to their unique morphological features: An elongated bacilliform core with two rounded ends is surrounded by a membrane which may either tightly adhere to or \"shrinkwrap\" it without respecting the capsid's rod shape; in the first instance, straight or curved rhabdovirus-like particles are formed, whereas in the latter a biconcave disk results. There is little doubt that solitary tcrovirions have often been seen by electron microscopists, but their pleomorphism precluded their identification as viruses.",

Two further strains of Breda virus (BRV) have been reported; one was detected in feces from a 5-monthold diarrheal calf in Ohio, and a second Iowa strain was recovered from a 2-day-old experimental animal (Saif et al., 1981; Woode et al., 1985) . Despite repeated attempts, BRV has not been adapted to growth in cell or tissue culture, a problem which has hampered its biochemical, biophysical, and molecular characterization (Woode, 1987) . However, its pathogenesis and pathology have been studied in experimentally infected gnotobiotic calves (Fagerland et al., 1986; Pohlenz et al., 1984; Woode et al., 1982, 19851, showing that BRV infections may cause gastroenteritis.",

Infection was detected by scoring for cytopathic effect, and the results were confirmed by IFA and EM.

Extracellular BEV particles contain a helical nucleocapsid that is coiled into a hollow tube (diameter, 23 nm; average length, 104 nm; periodicity, 4.5 nm); the nucleocapsid is straight (Fig. 2E) , is bent into a C shape (Fig. 2G ), or appears as an open ring ( Fig. 2A) . This structure is surrounded by a tightly adherent envelope about 11 nm thick. Consequently, the virion assumes an erythrocyte-like or kidney shape, depending on whether the membrane bridges the gap between the adjacent ends of the nucleocapsid ( Fig. 2A-D) or follows its small curvature ( Fig. 2F -HI. The largest diameter of BEV is estimated at 120-140 nm. Club-shaped projections (average length, 20 nm), which are referred to as peplomers in analogy to coronaviruses, are present on the virion surface (Figs. 1A and 2A1 (Weiss et al., 1983) . In thin sections through infected cells, most particles appear rod-like (Fig. 2E) ; transversal sections show Different forms of BEV particles seen in ultrathin sections through BEVinfected equine dermis cells. On the right are electron micrographs of BEV particles; on the left, schematic interpretations of the viral structures seen in the corresponding photographs. (A) Virion with a toroidal core within a circular particle outline. The indicated section plane 1 leads to a biconcave structure with twin circular cross-sections of the core (B), section plane 2 cuts the nucleocapsid only once (C); (D) elliptical virion with little resolution of the interior; (El rod-shaped particle; (F) circular structure with an electron-lucent center corresponding to a cross-section through a rod-shaped particle; (G) virion with a C-shaped nucleocapsid; and (H) cross-section through G cutting the nucleocapsid twice.

Between 6 and 9 hours postinfection large polysomal aggregates are encountered free in the cytoplasm, and viral proteins can be detected by IFA. About 10 hours postinfection virus particles are first seen both within parts of the unaltered Golgi apparatus and extracellularly. At that time tubular structures of variable length, diameter, and electron density are visible in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of infected cells; they probably represent preformed nucleocapsids. It is unknown whether the accumulation of nucleocapsids in the nucleus reflects a nuclear phase in the replication of BEV [as was suggested from the a-amanitin and actinomycin D experiments described below (Horzinek et al., 198411 or aberrant virion assembly (Weiss and Horzinek, 198613) . BEV particles are enveloped by a budding process. Budding was observed predominantly in the Golgi system, resulting in the presence of virions accumulating in the lumen of the Golgi cisternae. Preformed nucleocapsid tubules approach the Golgi membrane with one of the rounded ends, followed by attachment along one side. During the budding process the BEV nucleocapsid is apparently stabilized, leading to a higher electron density and a constant diameter [23 nm (Weiss and Horzinek, 1986b) l; nonenveloped capsids appear more flexuous, with a ragged outline.",

Their envelope bears peplomers 8-10 nm in length ( Fig.  1B) (Woode et al., 1982) . Longer peplomers are occasionally seen (17-24 nm), especially on virions of the Ohio strain and the second Iowa strain (Woode et al., 19851 , but they may not belong to the virion proper (Woode et al., 1982) . In virus-infected intestinal cells of calves killed 48-96 hours postinfection, 21-nm-diameter tubules of indeterminate length were found both in the cytoplasm and in nuclei (Fagerland et al., 1986; Pohlenz et al., 1984) . As has been observed for BEV, intracellular virions were rod-shaped with rounded ends; they measured 35-40 nm in diameter and were 80-100 nm long (Fagerland et al., 1986; Pohlenz el al., 1984) .",

On the basis of in uztro translation studies with BEV, RNA2 was identified as the mRNA for the synthesis of the P protein precursor (Fig. 3 ) (Snijder et al., 1988 ). An ORF of 4743 nucleotides in the unique 5' region of RNA2 was identified, accounting for a BEV P protein precursor of about 178 kDa (Snijder et al., 1990b) . The deduced amino acid sequence contains a number of domains typical of type I membrane proteins: an N-terminal signal sequence, a putative C-terminal transmembrane anchor, and a cytoplasmic tail. A possible \"trypsinlike\" cleavage site, two heptad repeat domains, and 18 potential N-glycosylation sites were identified. The mature P protein consists of two subunits of approximately 111 and 65 kDa, suggesting that the predicted cleavage site is functional in uiuo. Functionality of some of the glycosylation sites was confirmed by the effect of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-glycoslyation; in its presence, the production of infectious virions was drastically reduced, and the approximately 200-kDa uncleaved precursor that is normally seen in infected cells was converted to a faster-migrating protein .",

I n uitro studies have shown that it is translated from the ORF located at the 5' end of RNA3 ( Fig. 3 ) (Snijder et aZ., 1990a) . The nucleotide sequence of the E protein gene of BEV was determined, and its 26.5-kDa translation product was identified by in uitro transcription and translation. In polyacrylamide gels the E protein migrates with an apparent mass of a 22-kDa protein, probably because of its strong hydrophobicity (den Boon et al., 1991a) . Computer analysis of the protein sequence revealed the characteristics of a class I11 membrane protein containing three successive transmembrane a-helices in the N-terminal half, very similar to the coronaviral membrane (MI protein (den Boon et al., 1991a) . Proteinase K digestion experiments using E protein that had been expressed in the presence of microsomes showed that only small portions of either end of the polypeptide are exposed on opposite sides of the vesicle membranes. To determine the orientation of the E protein in the membrane, an expression plasmid was constructed that contained most of the E protein gene. However, its 3' end was replaced with that of a coronavirus M protein gene to which an antipeptide serum was available. This construct (E/M) was used to show that the C terminus of the E protein is present a t the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, which is another similarity to the coronavirus M protein. Immunofluorescence experiments indicated that the E/M protein accumulated in intracellular membranes, predominantly those of the endoplasmic reticulum (den Boon et al., 199 1 a).",

Most of the experimentally infected calves (aged 1 hour to 10 weeks) developed watery diarrhea within 24-72 hours postinfection which lasted 4-5 days, and shed virus for 3-4 days, as determined by HA (Woode et al., 1982 (Woode et al., ,1983 (Woode et al., ,1985 . The most severe clinical signs occurred 24-48 hours after onset of the diarrhea, and were accompanied by dehydration and weakness (Woode, 1987) . In some calves the diarrhea was preceded by a mild temperature reaction (40\u00b0C). Diarrhea generally was more severe in the calves with a normal intestinal flora than in gnotobiotic calves. In some infected calves severe depression was observed. One conventional calf developed hyperpnea and a watery eye discharge (Woode et al., 1982 (Woode et al., , 1985 . This finding has become more interesting after the recently described isolations of TVLPs from the respiratory tract of calves with severe pneumonia (Vanopdenbosch et al., 1991, 199213) . Woode et al. (1982, 1985) found a reduction of D-XYlose resorption in calves, ranging from 15% in animals with mild diarrhea to 65% in severely affected calves. This finding indicates some loss of absorptive capacity of the small intestine, but it is not as extreme as in rotavirus infections (the most common cause of diarrhea in calves), in which there is a 60-100% reduction in the rate of D-xylose absorption. The discrepancy can be explained by differences in cell tropism: Toroviruses mainly infect differentiating epithelial cells in the crypts of the intestinal villi, especially in the large intestine (Woode et al., 19821 , whereas rotaviruses predominantly target the mature epithelial (absorptive) cells of the small intestine (Mebus et al., 1971) .",

Respiratory torovirus infections occur mainly during the first month of life and between 4 and 6 months of age, with an autumn peak. In about 25% of all cases, sudden death had occurred; besides pneumonia, tracheitis, and diarrhea, central nervous symptoms have incidentally been observed (Vanopdenbosch et al., 1992a) .

The sample was negative for other pathogens, but an association between the presence of TVLPs and diarrhea could not be made since no healthy control animals were examined. In addition, rotavirus and a small round virus were detected in other animals in the herd involved in the disease outbreak, a finding which further obscured a possible etiological relationship between the presence of TVLPs and disease. Similarly, Durham et al. (1989) found TVLPs by EM in seven of 72 stool samples from piglets with diarrhea. Muir et al. (1990) reported hemagglutinating TVLPs in feces from specified pathogen-free kittens that had been inoculated with fecal filtrates from a cat with third-eyelid prolapse and diarrhea. Rising titers to the particles were found in five of 50 cats with the disease, but a rise in antibody titer against parvovirus simultaneously occurred in eight of 43 cats tested, against coronavirus in seven of 43, and against rotavirus in 10 of 43.

Villous fusion and atrophy (Fig. 6) and epithelial desquamation were seen, from the midjejunum to the lower small intestine, in addition to areas of necrosis in the large intestine. Both crypt and villus epithelial cells were infected (Woode et al., 1982; Woode, 1987) . The watery diarrhea is probably a result of loss of resorptive capacity of the colonic mucosa, combined with mild malabsorption in the small intestine (Hall, 1987) . Infection of crypt epithelium may affect the duration of diarrhea, as regeneration of villus epithelium starts in the crypts. The germinal centers of the Peyer's patches were depleted of lymphocytes and occasionally showed fresh hemorrhage (Woode et al., 1982) . The dome epithelial cells, including the M cells, had the same cytopathic changes that occurred in the absorptive cells of villi Pohlenz et al., 1984) . In tissues underlying the intestinal epithelium (lamina propria), the major pathological changes were edema and the presence of activated macrophages (Fagerland et al., 1986) . One of the BRVinfected calves had multifocal petechial hemorrhages and vesicular emphysema in the lungs (Woode et al., 1982) . EM examination of affected areas revealed the presence of virions in cells of both the small and large intestines. Extracellular virus appeared in close association with microvilli of absorptive cells and in coated pits between microvilli, which was interpreted to indicate receptor-mediated endocytosis (Fagerland et al., 1986; Goldstein et al., 1979) . In addition, virions were found between enterocytes at the basal and lateral plasma membranes. Virions in various stages of degradation were present in macrophages within the lamina propria (Fagerland et al., 1986; .",

The same serum inhibited HA of the heterologous serotype to a low but significant degree and efficiently neutralized the infectivity of BEV (Koopmans et al., 1986) . Since these experiments were done with surface-labeled virus preparations, no information was obtained about possible cross-reactivity at the level of the N protein. W o sera from cattle with antibody against Lyon-4 virus, a TVLP observed in feces from cattle in France (Moussa et al., 1983) , precipitated BEV proteins (including the N protein) from lysates of infected EMS cells in a RIPA (Horzinek et al., 1985) . In view of the notorious tendency of Staphylococcus aureus protein A to adsorb to the N protein (Fig. 4 , left, lane 11 (Kaeffer et al., 19891 , these results must be reevaluated. Vanopdenbosch et al. (1991, 199213) confirmed the cross-reactivity between BEV and BRV and extended it to BRTV: Scattered immunofluorescence was seen in 20% of the cells infected with BRTV when using a monoclonal antibody against the BEV P protein or convalescent-phase sera from a calf that had been experimentally infected with BRV. Homologous sera detected 100% of infected cells, and fluorescence was more evenly spread throughout the cytoplasm of the cells (Vanopdenbosch et al., 1992b) .",

            "text": "Studies of the immunity to torovirus infections have focused on the humoral immune response for an obvious technical reason: Measuring antibody is simpler than assessing cellular immune responses. The level of maternal antibodies probably influences the clinical outcome of BRV infection, since differences in the severity of diarrhea were observed between colostrum-fed and colostrum-deprived animals (Woode et al., 1985) . We have studied the antibody response after natural infection with BRV in a group of 10 sentinel calves (Fig. 7) (Koopmans et al., 1990) . These calves were purchased from different farms at 1 week of age, transported to the experimental facility, and kept separated from other cattle until 10 months of age, when they were introduced into the dairy herd. They were housed individually for the first week, transferred to group housing thereafter, and had access to a pasture. All regularly excreted BRV in the feces up to 4 months of age. Irrespective of the presence of maternal IgG, antibodies (Fig. 7 , solid line), all calves showed early IgM responses (boldface line); IgA seroconversion (dotted line) was not found at this stage (Koopmans et al., 1990) . In seven calves (maternal) antibody titers decreased below detection (Figs. 7A and B), whereas three calves showed active seroconversion resulting in persistent IgG, titers (Fig. 7C) (Koopmans et al., 1990) . A similar pattern was seen in 2000 sera from cattle of different ages collected in The Netherlands and Germany; maternal antibodies were present in > 90% of the young calves and gradually disappeared at 3-4 months, leaving that age group practically seronegative. From 7 months of age on, the proportion of seroconvertants steeply increased, to reach 94% at 2 years of age (Koopmans et al., 1989) . After introduction of the sentinel calves into the dairy herd at 10 months of age, all of them had mild diarrhea, and shedding of BRV was observed in eight of them. Seroconversion for all antibody isotypes was observed, indicating lack of mucosal memory. In striking contrast, coronavirus infection in the presence of maternal antibodies led to an isotype switch in all calves but one, and a memory response was noticed after introduction into the dairy herd (Koopmans et al., 1990) . Differences in duration and severity between torovirus and coronavirus infections that might influence the degree of immune responses (Saif and Smith, 19851 were not detected. However, BRV has been reported to infect dome M cells, the epithelium overlying Peyer's patches Woode et al., 1984) . Because M cells play an important role in local immunity of the gut, their degeneration-as seen after infection with BRV-might lead to an impaired immune response.",

Times of fecal sample collection are indicated by short vertical bars above graph A; sera were obtained at weekly intervals. (From Koopmans et al., 1990.) Most adult horses (81%) in Switzerland possess neutralizing antibodies to BEV (Weiss et al., 1983 . Seroconversions have been found in 9% of paired serum samples from individual adult horses that had been randomly collected, with intervals between bleedings ranging from 3 to 45 days ( n = 273; Weiss et al., 1984) . Furthermore, neutralizing antibodies to BEV were found in sera from goats, sheep, pigs, rabbits, and feral mice (Table 11 ). Several investigators have looked for torovirus antibodies in sera from individuals that handle animals on a regular basis. No antibody to BRV or BEV was detected by ELISA or NT, respectively, in sera collected from veterinarians and farm workers in Great Britain ( n = 92) and Switzerland ( n = 84). Further, no antibodies were detected in 158 human and 38 simian sera collected in four villages in India with a high incidence of tropical sprue, a malabsorption syndrome of unknown etiology (Brown et al., 1987 (Brown et al., , 1988 Weiss et al., 1984) . Zoonotic torovirus infections are therefore unlikely or infrequent. Also, the lack of detectable antibodies in humans and carnivores ( Table 11 ) may indicate that some TVLPs of humans and carnivores are more distantly related to BEV than are the ungulate toroviruses.

Our study in The Netherlands found that seroconversion occurred significantly more often after winter dysentery outbreaks (149 cows on 19 farms) than on farms without a disease history (67 cows on eight farms). Looking at individual outbreaks, we found a significant number of torovirus seroconversions (>40%) in diseased cattle on three farms; coronavirus seroconversion was less common (Koopmans et al., 1991~) . Several investigators, however, have suggested a role for coronaviruses in winter dysentery. Van Kruiningen et al. (1985 detected coronaviral particles and antigen in lesions of the large intestines of cattle that had been infected with fecal specimens from cows with winter dysentery in the United States and found no seroconversions to toroviruses (van Kruiningen et al., 1992) . Several investigators have reported coronavirus shedding by adult diarrheic cattle (Benfield and Broes et al., 1984; Espinasse et al., 1981 Espinasse et al., , 1982 Horner et al., 1975; Saif et al., 19881 , but the same is true for healthy cattle (Collins et al., 1987; Crouch and Acres, 1984; Crouch et al., 1985) . Seroepidemiological studies in Japan and the United States have added evidence that coronaviruses may indeed be involved: A high number of seroconversions was found in cattle with diarrhea (Akashi et al., 1980; van Kruiningen et al., 1992; Saif et al., 1991; Takahashi et al., 1980) . Apart from the possibility that another, yet unidentified, agent causes winter dysentery, it is likely that infections with different enteropathogens can result in the same clinical disease picture, much like the situation with calfhood diarrhea.",

The viruses may circulate through subclinically or chronically infected adult cows or calves. This is not unusual; repeated shedding of rota-and coronaviruses by adult cows has been detected by several investigators, using EM (Bulgin et al., 1989; Collins et al., 1987; Vanopdenbosch et al., 1979) , ELISA (Crouch and Acres, 1984; Crouch et al., 19851, and IFA (Vanopdenbosch et al., 1979) . Both free virions and virus-antibody complexes have been detected, the latter more frequently (Crouch and Acres, 1984; Crouch et al., 1985) . A seasonal fluctuation has been described, with the highest numbers of coronavirus shedders at the time of parturition (Bulgin et al., 1989; Collins et al., 1987) . Sixty percent of the calves of \"carrier\" cows developed diarrhea, as compared with 20% of calves from nonshedders. It is unknown whether toroviruses use similar mechanisms. Repeated torovirus shedding was observed in calves (Koopmans et al., 1990) , but not in antibody-positive adult cows. However, the use of more sensitive assays might show a different picture: Infections and seroconversions were observed in sentinel calves immediately after they had been stabled together with adult cows, testifying to their role as virus shedders (Koopmans et al., 1990) .",

Viruses with an RNA genome can diverge rapidly because of the high mutation frequency which has, in part, been attributed to the lack of proofreading exonuclease activity in RNA replicases, resulting in the integration of mismatched bases into the nascent strand (Holland et al., 1982; Steinhauer and Holland, 1987; Strauss and Strauss, 1988) . The rate of mutation has been estimated at 10-3 to 10-4 per nucleotide per replication cycle. The actual rate of divergence (i.e., fixation in the genome of mutated residues) is limited by selection, since most mutations are deleterious. In a study of influenza virus isolates, the rate of divergence was 1% per year in the third codon (where many of the changes are silent), and 0.5% per year in both the first and second codon positions. Studies of other viruses have found divergence rates of 0.03-2% per year (Strauss and Strauss, 1988) . Consequently, the RNA genome in a virus pool within an infected host cannot be described as a defined uniform structure, but rather as a weighted average of a large number of different individual sequences (the quasispecies concept) with one predominant genotype (Holland et al., 1982; Steinhauer and Holland, 1987) . Exposure to the host's immune system can result in a selective advantage for less abundant virus mutants. The unique BEV isolate is probably a torovirus host cell range mutant with the \"selective advantage\" to infect cultured cells from the horse and the mule.",

Toroviruses are pleomorphic-intrinsically, but also depending on the particle orientation relative to the electron beam-and they may resemble coronaviruses (Woode, 1987) . The subjective element in EM interpretation can be reduced by the introduction of a serological confirmation step, as in IEM (Woode et al., 1985) or solid-phase immune electron microscopy (SPIEM) (Koopmans et al., 1990; Liebler et al., 1992) .

Finally, maternal or locally produced antibodies [a common situation in calves (Koopmans et al., 1986 (Koopmans et al., , 1990 ] may interfere with the binding of viruses to the immobilized and detecting antibodies (Chantler and Clayton, 1988) .

Our data confirm the close relationship between BEV and BRV, as suggested by their antigenic relatedness. To offer a comparison, the N protein genes of bovine and murine coronaviruses (MHV), which belong to the same antigenic cluster within the genus, are only 72% identical (Lapps et al., 1987) ; identity between their spike protein genes ranges from 61% (5' end) to 74% (3' end) (Boireau et al., 1990) .

When the conserved 3'-end genomic sequences of BEV and BRV are used, the sensitivity of detection by RT-PCR alone is l o 2 TCID,,/ml for purified BEV and 103 TCID,, for BEV contained in feces. Subsequent hybridization with a n internal oligonucleotide probe increased the level of sensitivity at least 10-fold (Koopmans et al., 1993a) . Given the unneeded high sensitivity of the test, the risk of contamination, the high levels of virus that are usually shed, and the availability of ELISA reagents, the RT-PCR is not our first choice for routine virus detection. However, for the tracing of virus carriers, pathogenesis studies, elucidation of tissue tropism, and identification of the sites of virus latency and of virus shedding in body fluids other than stool specimens, the technique may prove very useful. With regard to viral RNA detection in tissues, in situ RT-PCR should be explored as a powerful method, combining high sensitivity with tissue localization.",

The polymerase protein gene of both viruses consists of two overlapping ORFs ( l a and lb); the latter is expressed after translational frame-shifting that results in a fusion product of the two ORFs.

This cluster of positive-stranded RNA viruses includes lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, simian hemorrhagic fever virus, the Lelystadlporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (Plagemann and Moennig, 1992; Wensvoort et al., 19911 , and equine arteritis virus, its eponymic representative. The latter is the de fmto prototype and has been extensively characterized by the Utrecht laboratory. The virion is spherical, about 70 nm in diameter, and possesses a n isometric, probably icosahedral, nucleocapsid surrounded by a tightly adherent lipoprotein membrane, thereby fulfilling the structural criteria of togaviruses (Horzinek et al., 1971) . On the other hand, it owns a nested set of subgenomic RNAs, a frame-shifting mechanism in translation of the ORF l a / l b region, and a gene suite like those of the Coronaviridae family members (den Boon et al., 1991b) . Assigning the arteriviruses to this family on the basis of some similarities in replication would be no less fallacious than continuation of the togavirus assignment. Classification of arteriviruses as a new family would appear to be a n adequate solution.",
