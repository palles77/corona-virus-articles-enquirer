[2] [3] [4] The study we previously reported from the University of Virginia was an observational, case-control study of 133 children (age 2 months to 18 years) hospitalized for wheezing between April 1, 2000, and March 31, 2001 . This represented 93% of all admissions for acute wheezing during the study period. Children who had evidence of cardiopulmonary disease or immunosuppression were excluded. The control subjects included 133 age-matched and gender-matched hospitalized children without wheezing. They were enrolled during the same season of each matched wheezing subject. Demographic information was obtained from parent-administered questionnaires and hospital charts. The Human Investigation Committee at the University of Virginia approved the study. Informed consent was obtained from parents, and assent was obtained from older children.",

The probe was altered slightly, with BHQ-3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif) substituted for 5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine as the 3# fluorescent quencher. These primers and probe have been shown to detect all 4 genetic lineages of hMPV, and the limit of detection in our assay was 50 copies of viral genome per reaction.",

This is consistent with a highly significant association between hMPV and wheezing exacerbations observed in a 25-year prospective study of lower respiratory tract illness in otherwise healthy outpatient children (in Tennessee) who were younger than 5 years. 3 In contrast, hMPV was not significantly associated with wheezing requiring hospitalization among children 3 years of age and older in our study. Instead, rhinovirus was the dominant pathogen associated with severe exacerbations, which has also been observed in other studies of children hospitalized for wheezing. 7 In addition, the large majority (at least 80%) of the wheezing children age 3 years and older who were hospitalized in Virginia had striking atopic characteristics. 1 Combined with test results for other viral pathogens reported previously in the same patients, 1 the detection of hMPV in our current analysis increased the overall prevalence of viral infections among the wheezing subjects younger than 3 years to almost 90%. These results confirm and strengthen the observation that viral respiratory tract pathogens are the dominant risk factor for wheezing exacerbations in early childhood. Similar to other viruses that are significantly associated with wheezing during early childhood, more information is needed about the infants who are infected with hMPV and their long-term prognosis with respect to persistent wheezing and their risk for developing asthma. 8",
