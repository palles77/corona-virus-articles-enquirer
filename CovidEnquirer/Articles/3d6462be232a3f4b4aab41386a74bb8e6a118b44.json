Disaster management system of Korea consists of the central safety management committee, headed by the prime minister and subcommittees headed by the ministers of various government ministries. The central safety management committee supervises and coordinates overall policy related to disaster and safety, and also promotes negotiations and coordination among the relevant ministries. The subcommittees help ensure the seamless operation of the central committee, especially, the coordination committee under the Minister of Public Administration and Security, is in charge of the overall process of negotiations and coordination with regard to tasks delegated by the central committee. The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) provides emergency medical service (EMS) to Korea and plays a key role in the response to disasters and MCIs in most communities. A single-tiered fire-based EMS handles disasters and MCIs occurring throughout the entire Korean region and includes 16 regional headquarters of the fire department with a total of 1,400 advanced ambulances and 5,400 EMS providers. In addition, headed by the administrator of the NEMA, operates the central emergency rescue control team to supervise and control matters related to emergency rescue, command, and control at the disaster site.",

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the United States (US) has defined an MCI as a case in which more than 6 casualties have occurred (23) . Thirty papers were reviewed by searching MEDLINE and the Cochrane library prior to conducting expert interviews to create a definition for both disasters and MCIs that would fit the situation of Korea. A number of the aforementioned survey papers and classroom presentations on various definitions of disasters and MCIs were introduced in further expert interviews with instructors who had finished the National Disaster Life Support (NDLS) course, a disaster emergency medical expert training program. The classic Delphi method was used to conduct the first survey via e-mail with experts who are instructors of the NDLS course, and the policy Delphi survey (24) was undertaken as a secondary survey after presenting the results of the first survey to interview subjects so that they could collect ideas and suggestions.",

The 'Daily Accidental Management Situation Report' can be downloaded from the home page of NEMA (www.nema.go.kr) and is prepared by the NEMA Disaster Status Control Center. Next, we collected and analyzed internal NEMA reports, referred to as 'Accidental Status Reports' , which notify the relevant teams within NEMA (e.g., fire investigation, rescue and EMS) about major incidents (Appendix 1-4). These reports were made available for this study through the cooperation of NEMA. Using the Daily Accidental Management Situation Reports, all NEMA disaster reports from the 16 Korean provinces were coded and entered into an electronic database. Using the Accidental Status Reports, more detailed information was coded and added to this database. Finally, the cases that met the defined category of disasters and MCIs for this study were extracted to establish the final dataset.",

Spain showed a linear increase in the incidence of disasters over a 55-yr period , 82% of which were natural and 18% technical (2) . Most disasters showed a mixed pattern. For disaster types, flood was the most common (31.5%), followed by air crashes (30.2%). With regard to the effects of technical disasters, transit crashes showed the highest death rates (71.6%). For transit crashes, land-based events were the most common (43.6%), followed by air (32.1%) and sea (24.4%), results that were significantly different from those of Korea. In Britain, major incidents documented in research papers over a 28-yr period were analyzed to calculate the incidence rate; the results indicated a rate of 3 to 4 incidents per year with a total of 108 incidents (range 0-10) (2, 8) . There were 63 cases (59.2%) of public transportation crashes, 22 cases of civil disturbance (20.3%), and 16 cases of industrial incidents (14.8%). These results were similar to those for MCIs in our study. In our study, disasters and MCIs were analyzed to calculate the national and regional statistics for the incidence, crude mortality, crude injury, and characteristics of each disaster type using the NEMA database, which includes all major incidents and accidentals, to increase the credibility and sensitivity of the study and decrease the selection bias. We reconstructed our database from NEMA reports to verify the special characteristics of disasters and MCIs in Korea. Furthermore, in our study, both disasters and MCIs were analyzed to show the incidence frequency, the number of incidents for each incident type, and the number of injuries and deaths by time-series. In previous research, traffic crashes, residential fires and violence were reported as the leading causes of MCI (7) . However, the leading causes for disasters in Korea were road crashes, general floods, incidents at mass gatherings, and fires. The leading causes for MCIs were road crashes, fires, and general floods. NEMA has two separate lines of work, fire-based tasks and mitigation-based tasks, and it focuses only on prevention, rapid response and mitigation to minimize disaster damage with a minimum expenditure of resources. Thus, there is no efficient connection and cooperation with the Ministry of Health and Welfare, which handles the public health sector. A disaster management plan for public health is warranted to properly analyze and present the characteristics of disasters/MCIs, thus enabling preparations for each region, mitigating damages, and monitoring trends in disasters/MCIs. NEMA and the Ministry of Health and Welfare need to establish a system for cooperation on disaster management and epidemiologic investigation of the disasters/MCIs using a predetermined standard.",

The cause-effect relationship between disasters/MCIs and exposure of the disasters/MCIs related environment to risks could not be determined, and thus, this result could not be analyzed. Third, some of the administrative data were duplicated or may have been overlooked because when the incident occurred on the boundary of two provinces, such data were excluded from the study. Fourth, the data source used in this study was the administrative data prepared for immediate incident reports, and these data may not be suitable for monitoring or for the establishment of a long-term database. Finally, administrative data from all provinces were used in our analysis, but the number of incidents and casualties may have been underestimated.
