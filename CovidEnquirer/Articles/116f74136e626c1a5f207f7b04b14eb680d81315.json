            "text": "This chapter reviews the basic principles of medical management of rat colonies and diagnostic approaches to detect infectious diseases of rats. As is the case with other species, rats are susceptible to a variety of injuries and diseases that can cause distress, morbidity, or mortality. Any facility that houses rats must develop monitoring programs designed to rapidly identify health-related problems, so they can be communicated to appropriately qualified veterinary or animal care personnel to be resolved. These programs generally consist of multiple components, some of which are directed toward individual animals, and others that assess the health status of rat populations as a whole. Relevant aspects of medical management of rat colonies include (1) individual animal monitoring for signs of illness and distress, (2) colony monitoring for morbidity and/ or mortality trends, (3) microbiological monitoring of sentinel animals and/or the environment for the presence of monitored or excluded agents, (4) quarantine of incoming animals of unproven status, (5) screening of biological research materials brought into the colony, (6) diagnostic support for microbiological culture, serology, molecular diagnostics, necropsy, and histopathology, and (7) management of disease outbreaks.",

The persons given the responsibility for this observation need to have had sufficient training or previous experience with rats to adequately detect abnormalities that might be present. Grossly visible trauma or lesions may not always be present in ill rats, but subtler behavioral clues might be present. For this reason, it is important to be familiar with the normal range of behavioral patterns observed in healthy captive rats, which has been described (Saibaba et al., 1995) . Methods in which rats are videotaped and later evaluated for facial conformations that are correlated with pain or distress, i.e., the Rat Grimace Scale, have been used as a research tool (Sotocinal et al., 2011) , and similar use of these facial clues might have utility for real-time evaluation of rats for signs of pain or distress (Leung et al., 2016) . Other research tools such as automated activity tracking may also have utility for identifying illness-related abnormal behaviors, even in social groups in some innovative housing environments (Brenneis et al., 2017) .",

Likewise, genetically immunodeficient animals (such as rnu/rnu rats) may manifest signs of disease from agents that are clinically silent in immunocompetent animals housed in the same area. Although the overall health status of most institutional rat colonies is monitored by routine screening of asymptomatic animals, it is important to realize that daily individual animal observation can sometimes identify an \"index case\" of a newly introduced disease that has not yet been revealed via routine scheduled testing.",

A very common constellation of findings indicative of pain, distress, or illness is piloerection, decreased activity, an ungroomed appearance, and often a hunched posture (National Research Council, 1992) . Chromodacryorrhea (red staining and crusting around the eyes) is an accumulation of porphyrin-containing secretions that is sometimes associated with illness as a result of increased production due to stress or disease as well as decreased self-grooming behavior due to distress. Weight loss is another nonspecific finding, but since weight determination is a simple, rapid, objective, and noninvasive technique, it is commonly used to assess the general health status of an animal placed under observation. It should be realized that stress is not always manifested as an absolute weight loss in a growing animal, so it may be necessary to take into account the normal weight gain of young rats to document a variation. Table 11 .1 describes signs of illness that can be seen in rats, along with possible diagnoses. This list is not meant to be an exhaustive summary, but it includes some of the more common clinical signs and suggests potential differential diagnoses.",

Because both the disease state and the use of xenobiotics (antibiotics, analgesics, antiinflammatory agents, etc.) can affect the physiology of animals in a way that is difficult to control within the experimental design and could invalidate a study (Lipman and Perkins, 2002) , ill rats are often euthanized rather than treated. However, the situation surrounding the incident should be carefully considered to determine whether it is prudent to gather appropriate antemortem diagnostic samples and to submit the carcass for necropsy evaluation even if the animal is euthanized. Likewise, a process to monitor animal mortality records and to perform necropsy on animals whose death is suspicious is quite important, because in some cases such an evaluation can allow early detection of a problem that otherwise would reoccur and eventually affect a much larger group of animals.",

It is beyond the scope of this chapter to describe particular pharmaceutical dosages and treatment indications, but the reader can be directed elsewhere in this volume for diseasespecific recommendations. Well-referenced and comprehensive formularies that include rat-specific drug dosages are also available, written for veterinarians in both the laboratory animal and \"exotic\" pet specialties (Carpenter and Marion, 2017; Hawk et al., 2005) . When bloodwork is indicated for diagnosis of a rat health issue, small-volume sample collection and automated analyzers can provide useful data. However, dilution of samples should be done only when such methods have been validated, because dilution does not always lead to predictably proportional results (Johns et al., 2018; Moorhead et al., 2016) .",

Such conditions can only be detected and identified via sensitive and comprehensive testing protocols (National Research Council, 1991) . Despite the lack of observable morbidity or mortality, these subclinical infections pose a significant risk to the research conducted with affected animals because they can alter the background physiology of experimental subjects or cause variation and alteration in specific experimental responses. These adverse effects have been summarized in a number of reviews (National Research Council, 1991; Baker, 1998 Baker, , 2003 Nicklas et al., 1999; Lipman and Perkins, 2002) , and more recent studies continue to add to the list of potential adverse implications (Besselsen et al., 2008) . Two of the physiologic processes that have specifically been shown to be altered by the presence of these infectious agents in rodents include immune function and neoplasia, which are quite relevant because immunology, transplantation, and cancer biology are three of the disciplines that have historically depended heavily upon the use of rats (Gill et al., 1989) . As a result, one of the primary aims of a rat colony health-monitoring program is to document the presence or absence of particular infectious agents irrespective of any observable disease state. A term that is generally synonymous with colony health monitoring and is often used to convey this emphasis is microbiologic monitoring (Fujiwara and Wagner, 1994; Waggie et al., 1994) .",

Terms that are less useful without detailed additional information include specific pathogen free (SPF) and conventional. In general use, SPF refers to animals that are (1) considered to be free of major pathogens and some or all opportunists, (2) maintained under housing and use conditions designed to protect this high-quality status by excluding infectious agents, and (3) monitored closely to assure that there is no undetected introduction of excluded agents. Conventional animals are usually considered to be those that originate from uncontrolled colonies that are not subjected to routine health monitoring, or those in which some degree of monitoring occurs but there is no action taken if infectious agents are found. However, these terms are not really descriptive or representative enough to use when assigning risk to animals proposed for introduction to monitored, disease-free animal facilities. For example, animals from an institution that experienced an outbreak of rat coronavirus and decided not to undertake the steps needed to eliminate the agent from the facility can still be considered to be \"SPF\", since by definition this status is only defined by the particular list of agents of which the animals are specifically free. The term conventional also suffers from some ambiguity, since it can be used to refer not only to animal health status but also to facility design. For example, a facility that allows direct staff entry into rat rooms without changing out of street clothes would be termed a conventional facility rather than a \"barrier\" in the purest sense, but if microisolators and high-efficiency particulate air-filtered changing hoods have been used to successfully institute pathogen exclusion at the cage level, the animals themselves might possess a high-quality health status that is far from \"conventional.\" In practice, it may be more effective to communicate the specific panel of agents for which the animals have been tested rather than assigning generalized quality descriptions.",

When selecting animals for screening, there are certain points to keep in mind. Animals to be sampled should be taken from rack and shelf locations spread throughout the room to maximize the possibility of detecting an isolated focus of contamination. If multiple stocks or strains are present, an attempt should be made to sample representative rats from each of these subcolonies. It is also desirable to test both young and old animals (avoiding geriatric animals) if they are available, since parasite burdens may be higher in the young (National Research Council, 1991) , while the old would have had the best chance of seroconverting to agents that may have not yet affected younger animals. In a breeding colony, ideal choices might be retired breeders and surplus weanlings.

The purpose of health surveillance is generally not to accurately determine the specific prevalence of infection or disease in an area, but rather to accurately identify its presence by finding at least one positive animal in an endemic colony (National Research Council, 1991) . The minimum number of animals from a population that need to be tested to identify one positive animal can be viewed as a statistical exercise in random sampling. Probability theory can provide the equation necessary to determine the sampling size needed, based on the assumption that one is dealing with an ideal population (i.e., 100 or more animals, where all animals have an equal opportunity for pathogen exposure) and calculated based on variables such as the prevalence of infection (often estimated at 30%) within the population and the degree of confidence required in the result (Clifford and Clifford, 2001) . These equations have been used to prepare charts that have been published to assist in the selection of sample size (Small, 1984; DiGiacomo and Koepsell, 1986; National Research Council, 1991) . For example, if an infectious agent affects 25% of the rats in a population, one would only need to test 15 randomly selected individuals to have a 99% probability of detecting the agent. These calculations have the most robust application when dealing with large populations of animals held under conditions that provide little or no barrier to cage-to-cage transmission (e.g., an open shoe box or suspended caging with no filter tops) because, under those circumstances, agents are fairly uniformly distributed and would be expected to have a prevalence of 30% or higher. Under those circumstances, even if a room holds 1000 rats, it would still only be necessary to sample 8 of them to be 95% sure that an agent is not present. Many vendor quality assurance programs are based on this type of calculation.",

These housing systems are beneficial in decreasing the likelihood of disease transmission, but they also make it harder to detect infectious agents based on random screening protocols because the agent distribution is not uniform and the prevalence of infection may be far below 30%. Another problem with random screening techniques is the impracticality of selecting and testing animals from active research colonies without disrupting the ongoing research. For this reason, it is common to place sentinel animals into a colony for the sole purpose of health status testing. These animals are not assigned to any particular study, and under ideal circumstances they will be exposed to the same agents as the principal animals actually being used for research or breeding. Because they exist solely for the screening program, sentinels can be bled, sampled, or removed for nonsurvival testing at the discretion of the colony management without interfering with ongoing experiments.",

            "text": "Sentinels should be immunocompetent young adult rats (6e8 weeks of age) (Koszdin and DiGiacomo, 2002) . The use of aged rats should be avoided if possible, because these animals may be more prone to falsepositive seroreactivity (Wagner et al., 1991) . Selection of a particular stock or strain of rat to be used as sentinels will vary, and there is no single correct choice. Using the same stock and source as the principals that are being monitored may be ideal because it eliminates the additional risk of contamination that would occur if animals were imported from another source specifically to be used as sentinels (National Research Council, 1991) . For closed breeding colonies, this can be done by setting aside some of the animals bred locally to be used as sentinels, and if animals are commercially obtained, extra animals can be ordered along with the principal shipment. However, this approach is not always practical in nonclosed colonies consisting of animals of varying backgrounds from multiple sources, so it is common for facilities to order separate animals from a reliable commercial source to be used specifically as sentinels. In this case, a readily available outbred line is often chosen for sentinel use, since they are inexpensive and will generally mount a robust antibody response. Inbred lines can also be used, but it is important to consider any strain-specific limitations of disease susceptibility or immune responses, since these may affect their utility as sentinels. Occasionally, sentinels will be chosen specifically so that they have a coat color that differs from the principal animals to minimize the possibility that they will be mistaken for experimental animals and inadvertently used in experiments or for breeding. Sentinels should be placed in physical proximity to the principal animals they are associated with to ensure that they are exposed to equivalent environmental contamination. It is desirable to place them in a consistent spot on each rack so that husbandry and research staff can anticipate their location. If a single cage is used, it is customary to place it on the bottom shelf, since it is assumed that the concentration of aerosolized agents and particulate fomites will be highest near the floor. There are no firm guidelines for the relative density of sentinels, but for logistical reasons at least one sentinel cage should be in place on each rack or in each cubicle. The placement of one sentinel cage on each side of a cage rack (holding w25e36 cages) has historically worked well in most situations. Other approaches can be taken, such as allocating sentinel cages to each breeding or experimental subgroup, placing multiple cages on each rack to increase the theoretical sensitivity of the program, etc. Depending on the specific design of the program, each sentinel cage may contain either a single animal or a small group of rats. When multiple sentinels of the same age are kept in a cage, it is rarely useful to sample more than one at any time, since the microbiological status of cohabitating animals is generally uniform. The use of sentinels in pairs does offer two advantages in that the other sentinel in the cohort can be used to confirm positive results found in the rat initially submitted for testing, and this also gives sentinel animals an opportunity for social contact. However, use of pairs does increase the numbers of animals utilized so this should be considered as well.",

This is done to increase the exposure of the sentinels to environmental contamination that might be transmitted by either true aerosols or small particulate fomites that are generated and dispersed within the room as part of routine rodent care and use. However, it should be noted that, in this type of situation, the subpopulation of rats with the highest cumulative risk of becoming infected with an agent (for example, the sentinel cages receiving a constant flow of dirty bedding) are not being held with the same degree of cage-level containment as the principal animals, and if they do become infected, the amount of environmental contamination and subsequent crosscontamination to other cages in the home room or elsewhere may be increased. Since other open sentinel cages in the room would be at highest risk for secondary transmission, it also may become more difficult to determine the point of origin of an agent within a room if sentinels are becoming infected, not from their assigned principal cages, but from other sentinel cages. This can essentially give a type of false-positive result (Weisbroth et al., 1998) . During the sentinel program planning process, the benefit of a potential increase in the sensitivity of open-caged sentinels to detect an agent needs to be balanced against these potential adverse effects.",

The specific procedures utilized for the collection of soiled bedding and the transfer to sentinel cages vary widely as a result of the different types of cage/rack/hood configurations that are used and because they must integrate with the specific procedural methods being used for overall cage changing. However, to ensure that the transfer of bedding is having a net positive impact on colony health (by aiding in the detection of excluded agents) rather than a net negative impact (by increasing the cage-tocage transmission between principal cages) this practice should be standardized and incorporated into both written procedural descriptions and employee training programs. It should be realized that dirty bedding transfer may not reliably transmit all agents of concern in rodent colonies. For example, studies in both mice and rats suggest that coronavirus infections may be relatively easy to detect, but the respiratory mucosa-associated Filobacterium rodentium (previously known as CAR bacillus) may be difficult to transmit via transferred bedding and fecal pellets (Dillehay et al., 1990; Artwohl et al., 1994; Cundiff et al., 1995; de Bruin et al., 2016) .",

The time it takes a sentinel to be exposed to endemic infection would be expected to vary depending on specifics such as (1) the relative density of sentinels, (2) the frequency of cage changing and soiled bedding transfer, (3) the percentage of principal cages that have bedding sampled at each change, (4) the caging system in place, (5) the prevalence and transmissibility of the infectious agent present, and (6) possibly the macroenvironmental characteristics of the room, such as relative humidity and ventilation. Once a sentinel is exposed, there will be an additional delay until the development of an immune response ascends to levels that can be detected by serologic means. Experimentally, it has been shown that sensitive antibody determination tests can identify seroconversion in a period as short as 1 week postexposure for rats infected with agents such as the rat coronavirus/sialodacryoadenitis virus (RCV/SDAV) (Smith, 1983 ) and the rat virus (RV) parvovirus (Ball-Goodrich et al., 2002) . However, a more \"average\" timeframe is within the range of 2e3 weeks, and it is felt that the utility of testing results will be greatest if a period of 21e28 days is allowed for seroconversion. For this reason, sentinels should generally not be sampled before they have had at least 1 month of exposure. It cannot be assumed that an agent will make its way into a sentinel cage during the first week or two, so many programs allow for an exposure period longer than 1 month (for example, utilizing 2e3 months of exposure as part of a quarterly monitoring schedule). Of course, with the increasing use of PCR in screening programs, it is possible to directly assay for the presence of nucleic acids signifying the presence of viral, CLINICAL CARE AND DISEASE III.

Sampling of animals that are euthanized immediately upon arrival can provide confirmation of the health status of the animals as maintained by the vendor, although it should be recognized that serology would generally not be expected to consistently identify animals infected less than a week previously. PCR testing, bacterial culture, and direct examination for parasites can identify contamination over a shorter period of time, but there may still be a latent period. If the intent is to fully evaluate the status of all animals delivered, this testing must be repeated for each breeding unit of animals accepted from the vendor, and it should also account for the fact that vendors may produce the same strain in multiple, physically distinct breeding or holding areas (Small, 1984) . Such a program might be feasible for facilities with a very limited list of vendors and a small number of strains in use, but is often impractical for facilities that serve large, multidisciplinary institutions. In this situation, a more limited and targeted vendor surveillance program might be useful (for example, surveying animals when a new vendor is under consideration, or getting more information if there are specific concerns about the status of animals from a particular vendor for some reason). Occasionally, the status of the vendor's production colony is not in question, but possible contamination during transport and delivery is suspected. If that is the case, incoming vendor animals for testing should not be killed upon arrival, but should be placed in a quarantine facility that provides for not only containment but also exclusion of infectious agents (to eliminate confounding cross-contamination within the facility). They can then be given time to fully colonize with and/or seroconvert to agents they were exposed to in transport, and tested on a schedule similar to other animals subjected to quarantine.",

Room-level isolation would be ideal, but often there are space constraints when dealing with small shipments of rodents, and the common procedure is to utilize flexible-film isolators, cubicles, or ventilated cabinets of some type to partition a quarantine room (Small, 1984) . In contemporary colonies, the introduction of a novel, noncommercial rat strain is a much less frequent occurrence than the transfer of a mutant mouse line. However, if this activity increases in the future, it may be necessary to consider programs similar to those described for mouse quarantine that group multiple shipments into a single cohort for batch testing (Rehg and Toth, 1998) . The availability of microisolator-type caging, either as static units or within ventilated racks, has also allowed programs to be designed that are not all-in-all-out but still allow functional isolation and segregation of multiple shipments within the same room (National Research Council, 1996; Otto and Tolwani, 2002) .

Although rarely encountered in rat colonies maintained at a high health status, some institutional veterinarians choose to monitor for Seoul virus and the bacterial agent Streptobacillus moniliformis, because they can cause a zoonotic disease and could be a marker for wild rat contamination (Bleich and Nicklas, 2008; Eisenberg et al., 2016a Eisenberg et al., , 2016b Firth et al., 2014; Cross et al., 2014; Kerins et al., 2018; Mc et al., 2017; McElhinney et al., 2016; Verner-Carlsson et al., 2015; Easterbrook et al., 2008) . Other potential pathogens include reovirus, adenovirus, and rat polyomavirus 2 (RatPyV2). RatPyV2 is relatively prevalent in rats and has the potential to cause clinical and/or histologic disease primarily in immune-compromised rats (Besch-Williford et al., 2017; Masek-Hammerman et al., 2017; Rigatti et al., 2016) . The frequency of testing for a specific agent may be determined based on the perceived risks of infection, transmissibility, potential impact on the population and associated research, immune competence of the colony being screened, ubiquity of agent, and the requirements of the biomedical research community; however, it must be recognized that economic considerations also play a role (National Research Council, 1991) . One approach to health monitoring is to group agents that pose a similar biosecurity risk based on prevalence in the population. For example, relatively prevalent agents such as coronavirus, parvoviruses, RatPyV2, rat theilovirus, Pneumocystis carinii, Helicobacter spp., Rodentibacter pneumotropicus, Rodentibacter heylii, Rodentibacter ratti (formerly Pasteurella pneumotropica biotype Jawetz, Heyl, and Taxon B), and pinworms might be tested for on a quarterly basis, while more infrequently detected agents such as Seoul virus, adenovirus, pneumonia virus of mice (PVM), reovirus, Sendai virus, Salmonella spp., and S. moniliformis could be surveyed on a semiannual or annual basis (Pritchett-Corning et al., 2009; Liang et al., 2009 ).",

Tests with high (>90%) sensitivity and specificity (for example, serology) should be used when available. For those tests that lack sensitivity or specificity (for example, histology), results must be interpreted accordingly. Other parameters, such as positive and negative predictive values, may also be of value in interpreting results; however, these parameters can be affected by agent prevalence. For example, when agent prevalence in a population is low, the calculated negative predictive value is high; conversely the positive predictive value may be misleadingly low (Lipman and Homberger, 2003) . In other words, for an agent with low prevalence in the population, a negative test result confidently rules out the presence of disease, whereas a positive test result may be due to a false positive rather than a true positive. While highly sensitive and specific tests are available, it should be realized that no test is 100% sensitive or 100% specific. To this end, all unexpected results should be confirmed either using corroborative testing platforms, testing of cohort animals, or both. In no case should a decision about colony status be made based on a single positive result. As discussed earlier, daily observation is a critical component to any health monitoring program. Recognition of clinical signs is especially important in the early detection of outbreaks of disease and documenting emerging diseases. However, because most agents that infect rats cause subclinical disease, observation is a very insensitive means of screening for infectious disease. As a result, sentinel and colony monitoring programs have been developed. For health monitoring, animals may either be euthanized and a necropsy examination performed, or samples may be collected from live animals such as blood for serology, feces for molecular diagnostics, swabs of the oral cavity for microbiological culture, or perianal tape test samples for pinworms.",

Even the most careful microscopic preparation and examination cannot salvage tissues lost because of autolysis, tissue mishandling, or the failure to recognize and select lesions.

Whenever possible, the rat necropsy should be guided by a standard operating procedure and conducted by trained prosectors.

Artifacts can be produced by a number of conditions, including excessive tissue manipulation, improper dissection technique, poor instrumentation, osmotically injurious moistening fluids, autolysis, and poor fixation. Excessive digital manipulation and improper use of instruments, such as the use of dull instruments, can easily lead to injury of fresh tissue with distortion of normal tissue architecture. This is particularly true with rats, in which small tissues are easily distorted by poor handling, such as crush injury resulting from improper scissor use. It is important to optimize dissection technique. For example, stretching the optic nerve during removal of the globe from the skull can lead to extensive artifacts such as retinal detachment. Artifacts can result from the drying of tissues or the contact of tissues with fluids that are not osmotically compatible. These changes can be reduced by the use of physiological saline as a moistening fluid and the avoidance of tissue contact with water. Artifacts of autolysis can be minimized by the proper use of fixatives and by ensuring rapid mucosal contact with fixatives. The need for rapid fixation means that it is important to flush rat nasal passages with fixative and to infuse fixative intraluminally into bowel segments.",

The purpose of the necropsy should be carefully reviewed and will dictate the subsequent course of action. One must carefully consider the ancillary tests that will be performed on samples taken at necropsy, and this may dictate the order of collection and the necropsy methods that are chosen. For example, animal health and sentinel rat necropsies used to determine the pathogen status of colonies might necessitate aseptic technique and methods to acquire proper tissue samples for microbiological analysis. The specific types of organisms that might need to be cultured and the proper media to have available should also be considered in advance. Similarly, samples might need to be analyzed for the presence of macroscopically visible ecto-or endoparasites using special methods.

There are situations in which individuals each having a particular necropsy task are preferable to the use of multiple stations in which each individual performs a complete necropsy. One must carefully determine the need for randomization of animals across study groups at the terminal sacrifice. Sometimes randomization is warranted; at other times it might be useful first to necropsy controls before experimental animals to allow easier determination of macroscopic observations. Whenever multiple prosectors are used, careful records need to be kept about who is responsible for individual prosections or individual organs.

To accomplish this task, it is important to understand pathology terminology and develop a standardized lexicon for use. Terms associated with medical and pathological diagnoses are complex and specialized. Terms associated with gross necropsy description are best kept simple and descriptive. There is no one standard set of terms or way to describe findings. Good working examples of systems have been reviewed (Feldman and Seely, 1988; Bono et al., 2000) . Because a pathology diagnosis will be made from the collective microscopic and clinical data, a good description of the location, size, color, shape, texture, and severity of any abnormality seen is adequate to assure further examination. Some terms and examples are presented in Table 11 .5.",

It is unrealistic to screen all tissues for signs of disease and many tissues are not common sites of infection. Most commonly, systems exposed to the external environment (for example, respiratory and enteric systems) are screened. Other tissues often screened are based on known disease pathogeneses.

Serological surveillance has provided a bulwark against the spread of infectious agents for several decades and has performed a central role in improving the health standard for rodent research models. The major advantage of serology is that agent-specific antibodies persist for months to years despite the transience of the agent. This footprint of infection provides a large window of opportunity to diagnose infections; however, serologic testing at a single time point cannot distinguish active from prior infections. Although serology has few limitations, it is unreliable in the diagnosis of infections in immunodeficient rodents (Compton and Riley, 2001; Livingston and Riley, 2003) . MFI, ELISA, and IFA are subject to nonspecific reactivity, which can lead to false-positive results. This is especially true in bacterial serological assays due to the complexity and abundance of potentially cross-reactive bacterial antigens. With improvements in antigen production and reagents, false-positive results are uncommon. However, because of this possibility, a single positive should always be confirmed with additional testing. Nonspecific reactivity may also occur in serum from aged rodents over 6 months old (Wagner et al., 1991) , strains subject to autoimmunity, animals whose immune systems are nonspecifically stimulated because of injury, neoplasm, other noninfectious disease processes, or other types of antigenic stimulation (Wagner et al., 1991; Weisbroth et al., 1998) .",

The use of highly purified subunit antigens may increase specificity as crossreactive impurities are not present. However, the use of these subunit antigens may negatively impact sensitivity (Compton and Riley, 2001) . This happens because the host response is polyclonal, with many antibodies being produced to different antigenic epitopes on the infectious agent. Highly purified subunit antigens may lack the immunodominant epitopes to which antibodies have been produced and result in a test with decreased sensitivity when compared to one that utilizes crude protein preparations. Moreover, agents may express different epitopes during different stages of disease. Therefore an assay that uses an antigen that is only expressed at certain stages may miss some infections. In practice, a balance is sought so that purified preparations of multiple antigens are used, resulting in very sensitive and specific assays.",

Culture is especially useful when clinical evidence of bacterial infection is present (e.g., peritonitis, pyometra, and abscessation). Culture is most effective during the height of infection, and prior to administration of antibiotics or the development of an immune response (Compton and Riley, 2001) . Culture may also be used as a screening tool for pathogens or agents capable of causing opportunistic infections. In the latter scenario, mucosal sites of the intestinal tract (for example, the cecum) and respiratory tract (for example, the nasopharynx) are cultured on broad spectrum or selective media. Culture has the advantage of determining whether a live agent is present, as opposed to potentially nonviable DNA remnants or antibacterial antibodies from a past infection. Culture does have some drawbacks. For example, agents colonizing the mucosal surface may be present in low numbers or sequestered in areas not accessed by routine procedures (for example, the deep recesses of the nasal turbinates). Moreover, fastidious organisms may not grow well unless conditions are optimized, or their growth may be hindered by the growth of more vigorous bacteria. Some agents may take several days to grow into identifiable colonies, while some agents such as F. rodentium and C. piliforme have yet to be cultivated on cell-free media. Collection of samples for submission to diagnostic laboratories may also be problematic in that some bacteria, notably the Pasteurellaceae, do not survive well in transfer media.",

More recently, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationtime of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has emerged as a revolutionary tool for microbial identification (Singhal et al., 2015; Goto et al., 2012) . MALDI-TOF MS is based on laser-induced ionization and desorption of microbial proteins and peptides. The protonated ions are accelerated in a vacuum containing a fixed highvoltage electric field. The time required for the microbial proteins to reach the detector is a direct function of the mass to charge (m/z) ratio, creating a peptide mass fingerprint (PMF). The PMF pattern, representative of highly abundant ribosomal proteins, is unique for each species and is used to speciate microorganisms by matching the PMF pattern of an unknown specimen with the PMF patterns of highly characterized microorganisms contained in the database. Fig. 11 .5 shows the PMF of Staphylococcus aureus. MALDI-TOF MS improves the precision and rapidity of microbial identification compared to traditional methodologies. Culture and subsequent biochemical or MALDI-TOF MS analyses are very specific for most agents and can be supplemented with molecular techniques where precise speciation or strain identification is desired.",

            "text": "Details of the PCR technique can be found in a number of technique manuals. Briefly, PCR consists of repetitive cycles of a three-step amplification procedure. Double-stranded sample DNA is denatured into two single strands. Oligonucleotide primers specific for the agent (complementary to the specific microorganism genome and typically situated approximately 100 base pairs apart) are added and allowed to anneal to target sequences in the sample DNA. A polymerase (for example, Taq polymerase), an enzyme that functions in DNA synthesis, is added along with nucleotide bases and new DNA strands of a specific size are created. After \"n\" cycles of this three-step process of denaturation, annealing, and synthesis, the target sequence is amplified 2 n th times (30 cycles \u00bc 2 30 \u00bc 1,073,741,824 copies of DNA). RNA (RNA viral genomes) may also be detected by PCR. In this case, reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) is utilized. With RT-PCR, RNA is converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) using the enzyme, reverse transcriptase. The cDNA then becomes the template for PCR. The PCR product may then be subjected to gel electrophoresis, and if a targeted sequence is amplified, it will migrate to a specific location in the gel based on its molecular weight. Realtime PCR assays using fluorescently labeled sequencespecific oligonucleotide probes are commonly used for rodent health monitoring (Feldman and Feldman, 2001; Besselsen et al., 2002 Besselsen et al., , 2003 Drazenovich et al., 2002; Uchiyama and Besselsen, 2003) .

PMF was constructed as a mean value of 240 mass spectra using the need for expensive equipment and its labor intensiveness. This expense can be partially overcome by pooling of samples. In addition, costs will likely be lowered as technology allows for more automation of PCR. The expense of PCR also relates to the need for multiple samples from which multiple tests must be performed. Lastly, PCR is often performed on biological samples, many of which contain inhibitors of components of the PCR reaction such as heme and plant products that contaminate feces (Panaccio and Lew, 1991; Al-Soud and Radstrom, 2001; Compton and Riley, 2001; Feldman and Feldman, 2001) .

In contrast, detection of infections where colonization is transient (many viral infections) is possible for only brief periods of time. In the latter case, PCR may serve as an adjunct test. In this scenario, infections may be detected by a primary test such as serology. To confirm infection, additional rats of appropriate target age (an age at which colonization or shedding is expected) are selected and target specimens are tested by PCR. This two-methodology approach provides very convincing evidence of infection. Moreover, although PCR cannot distinguish between live and dead organisms, results from PCR testing can provide valuable information about the current status (actively shedding, free of colonization) among individual animals or groups of animals. The use of exhaust air debris environmental samples as an alternative/adjunct to sentinel and direct experimental animal sampling has been studied primarily for health monitoring of mice. These studies demonstrated that PCR testing of exhaust air debris environmental samples from racks with unfiltered exhaust air flow reliably detected the presence of fur mites, pinworms, Helicobacter spp., R. pneumotropicus, and protozoa (Bauer et al., 2016; Brielmeier et al., 2006; Jensen et al., 2013; Kapoor et al., 2017; Manuel et al., 2017; Miller et al., 2016; Zorn et al., 2017; Compton et al., 2004) .

For ectoparasites, the pelage can be collected and examined for mite or louse infestation. Most protocols suggest allowing the sample to cool to encourage mites to venture to the tips of the hair shaft in search of a warmer host. Alternatively, Scotch tape tests may be effective for detecting mites or mite eggs attached to hair shafts. The latter can also be utilized in the live animal.",

Detection of helminths in gross specimens may be enhanced by the use of a dissecting microscope. Incubation of a section of intestine in saline for a short period of time may also facilitate detection by allowing worms to migrate out of the dark fecal matter into the more transparent saline. Pinworms of the genera S. muris also deposit ova on the perineum and can thus be detected by perineal tape testing. For this test, a piece of clear cellophane tape is applied to the perineal skin, placed on a microscope slide, and examined for typical banana-shaped ova. This test offers the advantage of being usable in live animals. As an alternative, fecal flotation may be used to detect pinworm or cestode ova.",

Microscopic and gross examinations for parasites are advantageous in that they are relatively simple, straightforward techniques; some (tape tests, fecal flotation) can be performed on live animals and they are relatively specific. The disadvantage of these tests is that they lack sensitivity for detection of light to moderate infection and are thus quickly being replaced by more sensitive PCR (Jackson et al., 2013; Gerwin et al., 2017) . Indeed, some contemporary health-monitoring programs routinely employ PCR for parasite screening. Infectious agents that are not efficiently transmitted to sentinel rats via dirty bedding (e.g., endoparasites and fur mites) are more reliably detected in samples taken directly from colony rats. Optimal sample types include feces for the detection of endoparasites (e.g., Entamoeba sp., Giardia sp., pinworms, Rodentolepis sp.) and fur swabs or cage swabs for the detection of mites (e.g., Ornithonyssus bacoti and Radfordia ensifera). PCR testing of large numbers of samples is costly. To offset the cost, individual samples are routinely pooled. PCR offers exquisite sensitivity, detecting as few as 1e10 template copies (Compton and Riley, 2001) ; therefore individual samples may be pooled in groups of 10 with little concern for loss of diagnostic sensitivity.",

The design of these testing profiles requires consideration of several factors as outlined in earlier sections of this chapter. Tiered testing strategies are very economical and are becoming commonplace (Laber-Laird and Proctor, 1993) . With these strategies, the most prevalent agents are tested for on a frequent basis via inexpensive high-throughput tests, while testing for agents of low prevalence or screening of animals for indication of emerging diseases occurs on a less frequent basis. For example, rats may be screened for endoparasites, ectoparasites, C. piliforme, Helicobacter spp., M. pulmonis, R. pneumotropicus, R. heylii, R. ratti, parvoviruses, PVM, RTV/Boone cardiovirus, and RCV/SDAV on a quarterly basis, whereas less prevalent agents such as Corynebacterium kutscheri, F. rodentium, S. moniliformis, adenovirus, LCMV, reovirus, Sendai virus, and Seoul virus are tested for once a year (Nicklas et al., 2002; Mahler et al., 2014; Pritchett-Corning et al., 2009 ).",

Verification may include testing a sample (serum) using an alternative test platform, testing a second sample from the affected animals using an alternative test platform (for example, through PCR), or testing cohort animals (Livingston and Riley, 2003; Weisbroth et al., 1998) . As discussed earlier, there are three primary serologic testing platforms: ELISA, MFI, and IFA. These platforms can also be used as adjuncts for each other. In most diagnostic laboratories, the MFI and/or ELISA serves as the primary serological test, and borderline or solitary positive results are confirmed by IFA.

In these cases, testing of cohort animals may be warranted and a diagnostic plan to test with different testing platforms should be designed. For example, if a rat is found to be seropositive for a rat parvovirus, additional animals from that colony may be tested by serology and their mesenteric lymph nodes may concurrently be tested by PCR for rat parvovirus. Testing of cohort animals is also warranted in the case where very few animals are seropositive. This scenario may indicate an early outbreak or a false-positive result.

Based on this information, if an excluded agent appears to be present, the room should be quarantined to prevent further spread throughout the facility while the situation is being further assessed. Scheduled incoming shipments should be diverted to other areas and transfers out of the room should be canceled or approved only after specific risk assessment of where the animals are to be taken and for what purpose. Changes to standard practices that have the potential to affect cross-contamination should be considered, such as the room entry order, the handling and transport of soiled cages, the protective clothing and disinfectants used in the room, and the amount of personnel traffic allowed. A follow-up plan should be implemented to establish whether the agent truly does exist within the room by performing additional confirmatory testing on remaining sentinels or principal animals.

            "text": "There are a variety of methods that can be used to eliminate an infectious agent from an area, and careful professional judgment is needed to determine the most appropriate course of action. If the animals are replaceable and the primary consideration is to return the room to normal use, complete depopulation followed by environmental decontamination can be performed. Attempting partial depopulation by removing positive animals (via test and cull) may not be the most productive approach for many rodent colony disease outbreaks due to the large numbers of animals often involved, the delay between exposure and seroconversion (although PCR testing can be used to minimize that concern), and the possibility that the disease will be further spread during the handling and sampling procedures needed to test the entire population. As an alternative approach, if the agent does not establish persistent infection, it may be useful to test and remove the negative animals. Fully immune populations should pose little risk of shedding to na\u00efve animals after infection by agents such as coronavirus or Sendai virus. By retaining only previously exposed seropositive animals to reestablish a breeding program, it is possible to produce seronegative offspring (Brammer et al., 1993) . A related approach to break the chain of transmission and repopulate an area without determining the serologic status of each individual rat allowed to remain is the cessation of breeding method, also known as burnout or stop-breeding schemes. By eliminating the introduction of na\u00efve animals from outside and eliminating all internal breeding for a period of time (6e8 weeks is recommended), coronavirus can be eliminated from a population (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1985; Jacoby and Gaertner, 1994) . Reciprocal transfer of soiled bedding between all cages during the early weeks of a burnout period is an optional step that theoretically can help assure that all animals have had equivalent exposure to the agent. Of note, these techniques may not work in immunodeficient rats and should be used with caution in genetically engineered rats.",

Detailed description of techniques used for rat cesarean section rederivation with or without superovulation have been published (Rouleau et al., 1993; Sharp and LaRegina, 1998) . Although the techniques may not be as well established or efficient in rats, superovulation, embryo transfer, and cryopreservation methods similar to those used in mice can be successful in rats and are still being improved upon (Robl and Heideman, 1994; Lambert et al., 2017) .
