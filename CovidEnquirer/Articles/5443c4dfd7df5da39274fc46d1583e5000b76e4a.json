However, the mechanisms of establishment of persistent infection are still unclear. In this study, we investigated which signaling pathways play important roles in escape from apoptosis in cells infected with SARS-CoV. In persistently infected cells at 50 h.p.i., PI3K/Akt, JNK, p38 MAPK and Bcl-2 were phosphorylated and the protein levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were increased. When surviving cells were treated with the JNK-specific inhibitor, SP600125, at 50 h.p.i., all cells died, suggesting that the JNK signaling pathway is necessary for maintenance of persistently infected cells. Among the signaling pathways in persistently infected cells, Akt and JNK were phosphorylated in SARS-CoV-nucleocapsid (N) protein-expressing Vero E6 cells using vaccinia viral vector (DIs), strongly suggesting that N protein-induced phosphorylation of Akt and JNK are necessary to establish persistence. These results indicated that at least four proteins, Akt, JNK, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, are necessary for survival of persistently SARS-CoV-infected cells.",

Infection of Vero E6 cells with SARS-CoV induces apoptosis via activation of caspase-3 [3] . Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) 1/2, and p38 MAPK, are phosphorylated in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells [3] [4] [5] . Especially, activation of p38 and inactivation of Akt by SARS-CoV infection induce cytopathic effects and apoptosis in virus-infected cells, respectively. Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK is known to regulate signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and 90 kDa ribosomal S6 kinases [5, 6] . Although the majority of virus-infected cells die by apoptosis, we found that a small population of virus-infected cells remained alive and these cells grew with production of virus [7] . Four groups, including ours, independently reported persistent infection of cultured cells by SARS-CoV [8] [9] [10] . We found that JNK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways are important for the establishment of persistent SARS-CoV infection in Vero E6 cells when these specific inhibitors were added soon after viral adsorption.",

After washing out with water, the plates were scanned with a GT-9400UF scanner (Epson, Tokyo, Japan). The dye-protein complexes were released hydrolytically with 0.1 M NaOH and measured spectrophotometrically at 660 nm. When cells and the supernatant contained infectious SARS-CoV, the cell number was counted using this method. The number of cells that did not contain SARS-CoV was counted using the WST-1 cell proliferation assay system (Takara, Shiga, Japan).",

At 24 h.p.i., cells begin to show rounding and persistently infected cells are observed after 48 h.p.i. To investigate which signaling pathways are phosphorylated in persistently SARS-CoV-infected cells, protein samples were obtained from these cells at 50 h.p.i. Vero E6 cells were prepared at confluency in T-25 flasks with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), and infected with SARS-CoV at 5 m.o.i. On the other hand, Vero E6 cells were prepared in T-25 flasks at several concentrations with 2% FBS containing DMEM as controls because surviving cell number is different (less than 5% of total cells) in each experiment. At 50 h.p.i., surviving cells and controls were washed with 2% FBS containing DMEM 5 times (with pipetting 25 times). Although most dead cells were washed out, a fraction of dead cells were attached to surviving cells and could not be removed completely by washing. As phosphorylation status of signaling pathways sometimes changes following trypsinization and centrifugation, sample buffer for Western blotting analysis was added directly to the washed cells. We obtained a protein sample from mock-infected cells, with a similar cell number to persistently infected cells. The protein samples seemed to contain a maximum of 50% proteins from surviving cells. Western blotting analysis was performed using antibodies to phosphorylated proteins of signaling pathways. As shown in Fig. 1 , Akt, JNK, and p38 MAPK were phosphorylated in surviving cells. On the other hand, Akt was phosphorylated in control cells, while JNK and p38 MAPK were not. As Akt was dephosphorylated in both confluent and subconfluent cells after 18 h.p.i. as shown in our previous studies [4, 13] , detection of strongly phosphorylated Akt was suggested to reflect a feature of surviving cells that had escaped from cell death. In addition, the phosphorylated Akt in surviving cells indicated anti-apoptotic activity. The levels of the anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, and phosphorylated Bcl-2, were also increased in surviving cells. The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, play important roles in inhibiting mitochondria-dependent cell death pathways [14] . This result suggested that Akt and JNK are important to establish persistent infection as indicated in our previous study, and that Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 are important for survival. Interestingly, p38 MAPK was strongly phosphorylated in surviving cells, suggesting that persistently infected cells consist of a balance between cell death and survival.",

Therefore, we concluded that activation of JNK and PI3K/Akt by SARS-CoV infection is important for the establishment of persistence. To investigate whether these inhibitors affect the establishment of viral persistence in cells at the late stage of SARS-CoV infection, cells were treated with inhibitors at 50 h.p.i. As shown in Fig. 2A and B, SP600125 killed the cells completely, while LY294002 did not. As LY294002 has an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, as indicated in Fig. 2C and in our previous study [13] , the growth rate of persistently infected cells was slow. On the other hand, treatment with SP600125 in the absence of SARS-CoV infection did not affect cell proliferation. As Akt in virus-infected cells was dephosphorylated after 18 h.p.i., as shown in our previous studies [4, 13] , phosphorylation of Akt at the early stage of infection may be important for preventing apoptosis. However, this result strongly suggested that once persistence is established, phosphorylation of Akt is not necessary for survival. Therefore, we concluded that activation of PI3K/Akt is essential for the establishment of persistent infection with SARS-CoV at time points before cell death, whereas activation of JNK is required at the time of establishment of persistence.",

They suggested that N protein is able to induce apoptosis under stress conditions. To understand which signaling pathways are phosphorylated by N protein in Vero E6 cells persistently infected with SARS-CoV, we made an N expression plasmid. Transfection of the N expression plasmid was performed using transfection reagents, Magnetfection and VeroFect (OZ Biosciences, Marseille, France), which our screen of transfection reagents suggested to be the best transfection systems for Vero E6 cells, which have low transfection efficiency (data not shown). However, levels of expression of N protein by these two reagents were far lower than those in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells. Therefore, we next used the vaccinia virus expression system (DIs-N) [11] . Vero E6 cells were infected with DIs-N at 5 m.o.i. and protein samples were obtained at 18 h.p.i. ",

Phosphorylation of Akt was down-regulated in subconfluent cells by SARS-CoV infection [13] . Nevertheless, LY294002-treated surviving cells that had escaped from SARS-CoV-induced apoptosis could still grow slowly. One of the reasons for this is that PI3K/Akt inhibitor needs 3 days after treatment to inhibit cell proliferation [13] . Therefore, persistent cell colonies may grow slightly in the presence of LY294002. SARS-CoV replicates in surviving cells, and these cells are still alive in the presence of LY294002, suggesting that the signaling pathway of PI3K/Akt is not necessary to prevent apoptosis in cells with persistent virus infection. The apoptotic signaling pathways may be blocked independent of PI3K/Akt in surviving cells. In this study, we demonstrated that the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were present at elevated levels in persistently infected cells. Because Bcl-2 is slightly increased and phosphorylated at acute infection (24 h.p.i.), but not Bcl-xL (data not shown), Bcl-xL may be more important than Bcl-2 for survival. These results indicated that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is important for cell survival in the early stages of SARS-CoV-induced apoptosis, whereas the JNK, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL pathways are important after apoptotic events. We found SP600125 that slightly prevented SARS-CoV-induced apoptosis (unpublished data). The JNK signaling pathway is one of the key factors for understanding persistence of SARS-CoV.",
