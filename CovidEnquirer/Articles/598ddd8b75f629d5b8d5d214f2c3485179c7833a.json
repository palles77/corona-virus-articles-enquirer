China's response culminated in legislation to control HIV/AIDS-the AIDS Prevention and Control Regulations. Three major initiatives are being scaled up concurrently. First, the government has prioritised interventions to control the epidemic in injection drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and plasma donors. Second, routine HIV testing is being implemented in populations at high risk of infection. Third, the government is providing treatment for infected individuals. These bold programmes have emerged from a process of gradual and prolonged dialogue and collaboration between offi cials at every level of government, researchers, service providers, policymakers, and politicians, and have led to decisive action.",

Although bold, these regulations were passed more than 20 years after the fi rst case of HIV infection was identifi ed. The development of a coherent policy was the result of a long and unsystematic process that involved initial mis-steps, considerable domestic and international education, debate, iterative trial-and-error learning, and scientifi c studies. The new legislation resulted from communication and coordination among many agencies, including administrators, service providers, politicians, the scientifi c community, and policymakers. We describe the infl uence of scientifi c studies and other factors on the development of HIV/ AIDS policy in China and provide a timeline of important milestones in the development of the current policy (fi gure 1). This review is intended as a general overview of progress in China and does not attempt to provide a detailed account of province-to-province variation in the evolution and implementation of HIV prevention and control strategies.",

In the mid-1990s, the occurrence of a second major outbreak in commercial plasma donors in the east-central provinces became apparent. 5 were paid to donate blood, the plasma removed, then the red blood cells reinfused to prevent anaemia. Reuse of tubing and mixing during collection and reinfusion led to thousands of new infections. 6, 7 At the same time, HIV was also spreading through sexual transmission. By 1998, HIV had reached all 31 provinces and was in a phase of exponential growth (fi gure 2), 8 which, by 2005, had culminated in an estimated 650 000 infections. 9",

Regulations were introduced that required foreigners who intended to stay 1 year or more and Chinese residents returning from overseas to have an HIV test.

These early policies did little to stop transmission of HIV; in fact, they probably promoted concealment of risk activities and made identifi cation of HIV reservoirs more diffi cult.

The total number, including unregistered drug users, is thought to be much higher, with one estimate placing the fi gure at 3\u00b75 million; 24 the UNODC World Drug Report estimated that in 2003, 0\u00b72% of 16-64-yearolds (ie, 1\u00b77 million people) were opiate abusers. 25 The most commonly used drug is heroin, which accounts for 85% of total reported drug use, although amphetamines are becoming more common, especially in urban areas. 26 Many drug users begin heroin use by smoking, but later fi nd it more cost eff ective to inject because of the stronger eff ect gained from injecting a smaller amount. Sharing injection equipment is common. 27 National policymakers have recently shifted their position and publicly acknowledged the extent and pattern of increasing drug use, which has led to a rapid increase in treatment options for drug users. According to the regulations on the prohibition of narcotics, 15 drug users identifi ed by authorities for the fi rst time are fi ned or sent to a voluntary detoxifi cation centre run by the health system, which might include short-term use of methadone, buprenorphine, or traditional Chinese medicine. De toxifi cation costs 2000-5000 yuan (about US$250-625) for one phase of treatment. 28, 29 If, as often happens, the treatment is not successful, relapsing patients identifi ed by authorities are sent to a compulsory rehabilitation centre, administered by the Ministry for Public Security, for 3-6 months. Those with multiple relapses are detained in a re-education-through-labour centre, managed by the Ministry of Justice, for 1-3 years. In reality, internment procedures and durations vary enormously between administrative units. In general, centres focus on detoxifi cation. Although some health education or treat ment is provided, the relapse rate is extremely high. [30] [31] [32] Cooperative actions by politicians, policymakers, government offi cials, and scientifi c researchers have resulted in the introduction of new strategies for drug control over the past 6 years. For example, the government is working with neighbouring countries to prevent drug smuggling, and is increasing anti-drug education for the general population and in schools. 29 The government has also commissioned research on harm reduction strategies, such as methadone maintenance treatment and needle exchange programmes.",

In 2000-02, a larger intervention trial of needle exchange programmes was done in four counties of Guangdong province and Guangxi, funded by the World AIDS Foundation. 34, 35 Cross-sectional data gathered at follow-up indicated that participants in intervention communities were almost three times less likely to have shared needles in the past month than those in control communities (odds ratio 0\u00b736, 95% CI 0\u00b725-0\u00b752).

The services off ered at such clinics have been broadened and provide access to other services, including HIV and hepatitis testing, antiretroviral therapy for eligible AIDS patients, group activities, and skills training for employment. The use of methadone maintenance therapy has been incorporated into the AIDS Regulations as a treatment for heroin addiction. Additionally, the requirements for entrance into methadone maintenance treatment programmes have been relaxed to encourage greater access. For example, patients are no longer required to have local residency or a previous history of internment in a detoxifi cation centre.

The overall participation rate in HIV testing in these pregnant women was 92%, and the HIV infection rate ranged from 0\u00b73% to 0\u00b77%. Among those who tested positive, 80% received antiretroviral therapy, and more than 90% accepted formula milk for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission. 74",

The country is currently in a transition stage in its HIV policy development. It is increasingly adopting approaches that are based on scientifi c evidence and has encouraged the pilot testing of controversial methods of risk reduction (eg, methadone maintenance treatment, needle exchange programmes, and the targeting of men who have sex with men and sex workers). Failures in scaling-up HIV prevention programmes have not been caused by an absence of policy, but rather, as with other countries, by there being no policy enforcement and timely scale-up. Although China has a strong central government, provincial and lower levels of government enjoy a great deal of autonomy, which has resulted in a mixed response and inconsistent enforcement of HIV/AIDS policy. For example, Yunnan province has shown strong support for implementation and advocacy of harm-reduction strategies that reduce HIV transmission in its many drug users, whereas Henan province had been slower to respond to the needs of former plasma donors in the early stages of the epidemic. 84 Moreover, the distribution of HIV in China is not even, and is concentrated in areas with high drug use (eg, Yunnan, Guangxi, Xinjiang, and Sichuan) and in areas where people were infected through unsafe blood or plasma donation (eg, Henan, Anhui, Hebei, Shanxi, and Hubei). The number of cases ranges dramatically between provinces (fi gure 5), with, for example, just 20 cases reported from Tibet but well over 40 000 in neighbouring Yunnan. In provinces with an extremely low prevalence, it can be diffi cult for offi cials to see the need for HIV prevention and control.",

Many rural areaswhere most of China's HIV-positive population resides-do not have the capacity to monitor patients' CD4+ cell counts and viral load. In some cases, the physical infrastructure exists, but staff do not have the skills or reagents to use it. Human resource capacity is a major constraint on China's ability to deliver HIV prevention and care. Many health workers and educators have poor knowledge of HIV and hold their own biases and stigmas towards those at risk or infected with HIV. [86] [87] [88] A substantial proportion of the funds allocated to HIV prevention and control is being spent on establishing training centres and in building the capacity of health workers so that they can deliver better services. But many of those willing to work in rural areas do not have formal medical qualifi cations to begin with, which limits their abilities to understand the complexities of treating HIV patients. 89 Furthermore, health services rely heavily on user fees, which often encourages health workers to do additional, chargeable services that many people living with HIV/AIDS cannot aff ord. 90 With an estimated 650 000 people living with HIV/ AIDS and an ever greater number of people at risk of infection, the government has embarked upon a formidable task. The provision of accessible testing and treatment services not only requires fi nancial resources, but also, in many cases, reorganisation and supplementary funding of existing local health services infrastructure, especially in rural areas where most of Chinese HIV-positive individuals reside. 91 In particular, rural areas do not have adequately trained staff capable of providing eff ective treatment and prevention services, as well as the laboratory and clinical infrastructure necessary to monitor treatment. 71 The problem of inadequate human resources is not restricted to health departments-in rural areas, there are few adequately trained technical and management personnel at all levels and across all sectors. The combination of insuffi ciently trained staff , inadequate technical resources, and a largely remote, poorly educated, rural population represents a challenge to the implementation of eff ective programmes.",

China's Titanic Peril, 23 published by the UN in 2002, made the unsubstantiated prediction that China could have 10 million HIV-infected individuals by 2010, a fi gure that has been repeatedly misused in discussions of China's HIV future. A Joint Assessment of HIV/AIDS Prevention, Treatment and Care in China (2004), 8 developed jointly by UNAIDS and the State Council of China, estimated that China had 840 000 people living with HIV/AIDS. This fi gure has been revised down to 650 000 in 2005 in light of more representative data collection and more appropriate estimation methods.",

These actions had a tremendous eff ect on the general community, and have now been backed up by policy changes. The AIDS Regulations have made it illegal to discriminate against people living with HIV/AIDS and their families in terms of their rights to schooling, employment, health services, and participation in community activities.
