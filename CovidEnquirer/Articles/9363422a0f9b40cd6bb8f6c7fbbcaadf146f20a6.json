            "text": "The induction of monocyte/macrophage procoagulant activity (PCA) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of murine hepatitis virus strain 3 (MHV-3) infection and disease. Previously, we have shown that induction of PCA by MHV-3 correlated with resistance/susceptibility to infection in different mouse strains. In this study, all BALB/cJ mice that were infected with 103 plaque-forming units of MHV-3 developed severe liver disease and died within 96-120 h. Examination of the livers of these animals showed marked hepatic necrosis, deposition of fibrin, and cellular expression of PCA by direct immunofluorescence staining in areas of necrosis as well as in hepatic sinusoids. Splenic mononuclear cells recovered from these mice expressed high concentrations of PCA with time after infection. Infusion into mice of a high-titered monoclonal antibody that neutralized PCA (3D4.3) attenuated the development of hepatic necrosis and enhanced survival in a dose-dependent manner. All of the animals receiving 100 #g, and 44% and 22% of the animals that received 50 and 25 #g per day, respectively, survived for 10 d and made a full recovery. Administration of the antibody resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in fibrin deposition, PCA expression as detected by direct immunofluorescence staining and by a functional assay. In animals treated with high concentrations of antibody, titers of antibody to PCA fell from 87 +_ 15/~g/ml to 100 +_ 7 ng/ml during the active phase of the disease, consistent with sequestration due to binding of the immunoglobulin to cells expressing PCA. Surviving animals, when rechallenged with MHV-3, had a 40% mortality, consistent with the known rates of metabolism of immunoglobulin. This further suggested that protection was by a passive mechanism. The results reported here demonstrate that a neutralizing antibody to PCA protects animals from fulminant hepatitis and death associated with MHV-3 infection, and supports the notion that PCA is a potent inflammatory mediator that plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of liver injury resulting from MHV-3 infection.",

Furthermore, using recombinant inbred strains of mice, we showed that genetic linkage between resistance/susceptibility to MHV-3 infection and induction of PCA was controlled by two non-H2-1inked recessive genes (5) . After infection with MHV-3, disturbances of the hepatic microcirculation associated with sinusoidal thrombosis occurred coincident with the rise in PCA (6, 7) . Intravenous infusion of macrophages, induced to express high amounts of PCA by MHV-3, resulted in rapid (2-5 min) death from disseminated intravascular coagulation in both susceptible and resistant mice (our unpublished observations). Together, these observations suggest that coagulative necrosis occurring as a result of induction of PCA may be a crucial feature of MHV-3-induced hepatic injury.",

Samples of frozen thawed SMNC were assayed for the capacity to shorten the spontaneous clotting time of human citrated platelet-poor plasma in a one-stage clotting assay as previously described (12) . Equal volumes (80 #1) of the cellular homogenate were admixed with citrated normal human plateletpoor plasma, and then 80 #1 of 25 mM CaClz was added at 37~ to start the reaction. The time in seconds for the appearance of a fibrin gel was then recorded. To establish arbitrary units, a rabbit brain thromboplastin standard at 36 mg dry mass/ml (Dade Division, American Hospital Supply, Miami, FL) was assigned a value of 100,000 mU. The assay was used over the range of 1-100,000 mU, and the results were linear with normal human plasma substrate. Data were converted to PCA per 10 6 splenic macrophages and expressed as the mean and standard deviation from six mice done in triplicate. Media and buffers were all without activity in this assay.",

No antibody to PCA could be detected in sera from normal control animals or in animals infected with MHV-3 who had not received antibody to PCA (data not shown). Sera from animals treated with ascites containing 25-100/zg of antibody to PCA contained large amounts of anti-PCA before MHV-3 infection. After MHV-3 infection, the concentration of circulating antibody fell, but remained at >100 ng/ml in animals treated with 100/~g/d. In animals that were treated with 25 and 50/zg of antibody, by day 7, antibody was undetectable (<1 ng/ml) (Fig. 8) . Antibody to PCA either in ascites or purified from supernatants did not neutralize MHV-3 in a standard plaque reduction assay as previously described (8) To determine whether treated animals that had survived the acute infection developed long-term resistance to MHV-3 infection, mice previously infected with MHV-3 and treated with 100/~g of antibody (n = 15) were infected with 1,000 PFU of MHV-3, 21 d after their last exposure to virus. PCA antibody titers in this group were ~5 0 % of that present during antibody therapy, consistent with known rates of disappearance of IgG. The MHV-rechallenged mice experienced a 50% mortality rate, suggesting that protection was by passive immunization of antibody, not an acquired, active immune process (Fig. 9 ). In addition, no antibody to MHV-3 was detected in these mice either before or after rechallenge with virus.",

The availability of a mAb to PCA that neutralized acceleration of coagulation in vitro (8) provided us an opportunity directly to examine the role of PCA in vivo in murine hepatitis virus strain 3 infection. All BALB/cJ mice which were infected with 103 PFU of MHV-3 developed severe liver disease and died within 96-120 h. Administration of the mAb to PCA attenuated the hepatic necrosis, fibrin deposition and enhanced survival in a dosedependent manner. All of the animals receiving 100/~g, and 44% and 22% of the animals that received 50 and 25/~g/d, respectively, survived for 10 d and made a full recovery. Furthermore, the same protective effect was seen in mice treated with IgG2ak purified from hybridoma culture supernatants (3D4.3). The increased survival of the treated animals was specific for anti-PCA, since ascites from mice injected with SP2 cells alone, which contained no antibody to PCA, failed to protect mice from MHV-3 infection. Although antibodytreated, MHV-3-infected animals demonstrated clinical evidence of viral hepatitis early in the course of the infection, by 7-10 d their behavior appeared normal and liver sections showed little or no apparent disease. Examination of the livers of antibody-treated animals showed marked reduction in hepatic necrosis and inflammatory cells (neutrophils and mononuclear cells), each of which are prominent features of MHV-3 infection (3, 6, 7) . PCA expression is a feature of MHV-3 infection in this mouse strain (2) (3) (4) , and in untreated MHV-3-infected mice, PCA was detected by immunofluorescence staining in areas of necrosis as well as in hepatic sinusoids. Both macrophages and endothelial cells expressed detectable PCA, but hepatocytes did not. It is likely that the hepatic necrosis is secondary to ischemic changes resulting from induction of PCA, leading to the deposition of fibrin. Administration of mAb resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the deposition of fibrin and in expression of PCA as detected by immunofluorescence staining in the liver and by a direct functional assay in SMNC.",

            "text": "Treatment of mice with 100/~g of mAb to PCA not only increased survival and reduced hepatic necrosis, but also resulted One possible explanation for the decrease in viral replication observed in mice treated with antibody 3D4.3 is that this antibody reacts with the MHV receptor recently described by Holmes and coworkers (22, 23) . We regard this explanation as unlikely, since 3D4.3 does not show any neutraliza- tion of viral infectivity in a plaque reduction assay, whereas antibody to the MHV receptor does inhibit infectivity. Furthermore, the MHV receptor has a molecular mass of 110 kD, considerably different than that of the PCA molecule (74 kD). A second possible explanation for the effect of anti-PCA antibody on MHV-3 growth in mice is related to the normal cleavage of the MHV S protein. It has been shown that cleavage of S by proteases is necessary to activate the membrane-fusing properties of the S protein (24) . This fusion property facilitates the spread of virus to uninfected cells by cell-cell fusion and also increases the specific infectivity of MHV when compared with virus in which S has not been cleaved (24) . It is possible that in infected macrophages, PCA, a serine protease, mediates at least in part the proteolytic cleavage of S into $1 and $2, and thereby activates the fusion properties of this molecule. Consistent with this idea is the observation that infection of A/J macrophages, which do not produce PCA in response to MHV infection, does not result in the appearance of syncytial giant cells (our unpublished observations). Thus, antibody to PCA could inhibit the spread of virus to uninfected cells by decreasing the activation of the fusion properties of S. Although the mechanism by which anti-PCA treatment protects the susceptible animals is not clear, the use of antibody to PCA neutralizes PCA, thereby preventing activation of the coagulation system and inhibiting fibrin formation. The antibody could also result in complement-mediated destruction of MHV-3-infected cells that express membranebound PCA or promote macrophage activation with restriction of viral growth. In animals treated with 100 #g of antibody for 7 d before infection and 10 d p.i., concentrations of antibody to PCA in sera fell from 87/~g/ml before MHV-3 infection to 100 ng/ml during the active phase of disease (day 5), consistent with sequestration perhaps due to binding of the Ig to cells expressing PCA. Furthermore, in these mice, levels of PCA in SMNC remained at basal levels. In animals treated with lower amounts of antibody (50 or 25 #g/d) to PCA, hepatic necrosis and survival were only partially attenuated, and antibody was not detected (<1 ng/ml) after day 7 p.i. Together, the data strongly support the notion that anti-PCA antibody neutralizes PCA in vivo during the infection and that this may be the basis for its protective effect.",

Recently, we have demonstrated that although PGE2 inhibited functional PCA, antigenic expression of PCA was not altered as determined by Western immunoblotting (25) . We have proposed that PCA may exert its effect through activation of the coagulation system with microvascular and macrovascular thrombosis (6, 7), but the present results, in concert with the inhibition studies of PCA by PGE2, suggest that PCA has other sites of action as well. The protective effects of the mAb to PCA occurred even though the BALB/cJ mice failed to mount an antiviral humoral response. Our ob-servations are consistent with a recent report by Korner et al.

Our studies support the notion that induction of PCA during MHV-3 infection in mice is an integral and potentially central step in the disease. A previous report by Taylor et al. (32) demonstrated that lethal Escherichia coli septic shock can be prevented by blocking tissue factor (a distinct procoagulant) with mAb, demonstrating the importance of cellular coagulants in the pathophysiology of other infectious diseases.
