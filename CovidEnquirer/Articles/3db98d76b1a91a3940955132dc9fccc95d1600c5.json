With agencies taking their cues from ministers, the whole of government response will be conditioned by the strength of political decisiveness and unanimity among ministers. The response to the tragic terrorist attack in Bali on 12 October 2002 underscores this observation. From the outset, the Prime Minister's instructions to senior officials were decisive: the government's response needed to be comprehensive and effective. Issues concerning resources could not be allowed to constrain the policy response -these matters could be addressed later. There was strong bipartisan support for the government's approach.",

The UK Government has established rapid deployment crisis teams which can move within 24 hours to lead the government's response to an overseas crisis (see Response of the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs to the Twelfth Report of the Foreign Affairs Committee Session 2001 Session -2002 Session , 2002 . The exact composition of the teams, possibly drawn from a range of agencies including foreign affairs, law enforcement and aid delivery, would depend on the nature of the crisis, from a natural disaster to a terrorist attack. The capacity of the teams to work together is likely to hinge on joint training opportunities. The pre-crisis development of a solid understanding between team members of each other's responsibilities and portfolio mandate would be vital.",
