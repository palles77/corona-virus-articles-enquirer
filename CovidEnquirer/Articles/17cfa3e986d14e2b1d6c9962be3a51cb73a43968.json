With the exception of smallpox, which some experts speculate is responsible for more deaths throughout modern history than all other infectious diseases combined, the greatest human and economic consequences derived from virus infections via natural exposure have been realized from emerging diseases, all of which have been derived from infected animals via zoonoses. For example, influenza pandemics that occurred in 1918 (H1N1), 1957 (H2N2), and 1968 (H3N2) resulted in approximately 40 -50, 2, and 1 million deaths worldwide, respectively ( World Health Organization, 2008 ) . It is thought that the 1918 H1N1 virus was an avian virus that was introduced into pigs, and subsequently transmitted to human carriers, which spread the virus along trade routes and shipping lines resulting in a global pandemic ( Taubenberger and Morens, 2006 ) . In the past 25 years, approximately 60 million people have been infected by HIV-1, resulting in greater than 25 million deaths ( Avert, 2008 ) . HIV-1 most likely originated in wild chimpanzees living in contact would include person-to-person spread, such as with community-acquired viral infections; animal-to-person spread, as with viral zoonoses; and spread to an unborn child from its mother, also known as vertical transmission. Also, viruses can be transmitted directly by vectors, such as mosquitoes and ticks. Indirect contact would include environmentally acquired viral infections (via food, water, air, or fomites) that are not spread by close contact. Infectious viral diseases can be spread through the air either by direct or indirect contact via droplet or particle transmission, respectively.",

Although risk posed by traditional viral agents is significant, a finite number of viruses fit in this category. Of particular concern are variola virus (smallpox) and viruses that cause hemorrhagic fever such as filoviruses (Lake Victoria marburgvirus and ebola viruses), arenaviruses (Lassa, Junin, Machupo, Guanarito, and Sabia viruses), bunyaviruses (hantaviruses, Rift Valley fever virus, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus), and flaviviruses (yellow fever virus, tickborne encephalitis virus, and dengue viruses) ( NIAID, 2008 ) .

Enhanced viral agents may also be capable of producing disease with a more rapid onset of symptoms, making timely diagnosis, treatment, and containment more difficult ( Schmaljohn and Hevey, 2005 weapon. The former Soviet Union conducted biological weapons programs to include large-scale industrial production of variola virus that was stable in an aerosol and was claimed to be deliverable in warheads ( Alibek and Handelman, 1999 ) . Subsequent to the World Health Organization (WHO) declaration of the eradication of smallpox in 1980, member nations agreed to destroy all laboratory stocks of the virus and/or provide them to one of the two officially sanctioned WHO reference laboratories: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, GA, or the Institute of Virus Preparations in Moscow, Russia. Although remaining stocks at these laboratories were scheduled to be destroyed in 1996, the World Health Assembly subsequently accepted a recommendation to retain the remaining stocks and to review a decision to destroy them on a periodic basis. Should the existing repositories be destroyed, other potential sources of smallpox may exist. Conceivably, sources of the variola virus may include unknown stores, cadavers in permafrost, and recreation of the viral genome or strains in laboratories utilizing genetic engineering, recombination, and data from published genomic sequences as a basis for design ( Darling et al., 2005 ) .",

Blankets from smallpox victims were given as gifts to susceptible North American Indians, resulting in epidemics among native populations leading to case-fatality rates approaching 50% in some areas. During World War II, the Japanese Military conducted experiments with variola virus for use as a biological control measures, and use of vaccines, when appropriate, to minimize consequences to human and animal health ( Gronvall et al., 2007b ) . Current approaches to biodefense vaccine development include use of existing applications for development and manufacturing, and development of new technologies to rapidly design, test and evaluate, and manufacture desired products. Given the urgency with which vaccines designed to minimize consequences of bioterror events are needed, new technologies and infrastructure are mandated to shorten timelines for their development. New technologies applicable to the design of vaccines would include rapid methods for the identification and selection of protective immunogens, and the development of vaccines that allow for differentiation of vaccinated hosts from those infected by exposure to virus, with options to employ improved adjuvants that stimulate innate immune responses and/or promote adaptive immune responses ( Capua, et al., 2004 ) . New infrastructure would include biocontainment facilities to increase current capacities for vaccine testing and evaluation, to optimize vaccine dosage and delivery in conjunction with routes of exposure, and enhance manufacturing capacities to ensure availability of a minimum number of doses for intervention and reduce average cycle times to manufacture vaccine lots. Rapid deployment of biodefense vaccines will require both infrastructures, to include facilities for storage of vaccine stockpiles, and technologies that ensure validated storage conditions for such stockpiles ( Gronvall et al., 2007a ) .",

The need to accelerate and expand development of current and new vaccines to prepare for intentional introduction or natural occurrence of catastrophic human and zoonotic diseases is reflected by the list of vaccines shown in Table 3 .2 . In summary, licensed vaccines exist for only a few viruses of concern and are of limited supply in case of catastrophic need ( Schmaljohn and Hevey, 2005 ) . For other viruses, vaccines are available under investigational new drug (IND) status, which have not been licensed for a variety of reasons, primarily the lack of market incentive to develop through to licensure ( Schmaljohn and Hevey, 2005 ) . In light of the paucity of medical countermeasures effective against viruses of concern, subsequent chapters of this text are devoted to review of vaccine development efforts against biodefense, emerging and neglected diseases.",

Such assessment must be performed to define gaps in knowledge or vulnerabilities in our preparedness posture, thus guiding prioritization of investments in biodefense-related research, development, planning, and overall preparedness. Vaccines represent a necessary component of biodefense countermeasure development to prepare for and to minimize the consequences of a biological attack. Risk assessments have provided a means of identifying and prioritizing vaccine research and development efforts for biological agents capable of being used in biological attacks. In support of vaccine research and development, current biodefense strategies include the development of an enduring infrastructure to test and evaluate existing, proposed, or promising countermeasures, assess their safety and effectiveness, expedite their development, and ensure rapid licensure ( Gronvall et al., 2007c ; NIAID, 2008 ; U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, 2008 ) .",
