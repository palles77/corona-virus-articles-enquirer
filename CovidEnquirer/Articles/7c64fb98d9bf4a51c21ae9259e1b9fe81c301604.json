As these are the viruses that are most in demand of antiviral therapy, they have prompted the search for new antiviral strategies and drugs directed toward either the same molecular targets as the approved antiviral drugs or to other targets. Most of the newly described antiviral compounds (that are currently in development) are targeted at HIV, HBV, or HCV. Some are targeted at HSV, VZV, or CMV, but, there are in addition many other important viral pathogens for which medical intervention, either prophylactic or therapeutic, is urgently needed, and, these are, among the DNA viruses, the papillomaviruses (human papilloma virus (HPV)), adenoviruses, poxviruses (variola, vaccinia, monkeypox, Table 1 The past, present, and future of antiviral drugs etc.) and the herpesviruses Epstein-Barr (EBV) and human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV- 6) , and, among the RNA viruses, enteroviruses (e.g., Coxsackie B and Echo), coronaviruses (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus), flaviviruses (e.g., dengue, yellow fever), and other RNA viruses associated with hemorrhagic fever (arenaviruses (e.g., Lassa fever), bunyaviruses (e.g., Rift Valley fever, Crimean-Congo fever), and filoviruses (e.g., Ebola and Marburg)).",

Cidofovir has been used 'off label,' with success, in the topical and, occasionally, systemic treatment of HPV-associated papillomatous lesions. 2 In many instances, a virtually complete and durable resolution of the lesions was achieved following topical application of cidofovir as a 1% gel or cream. In addition to cidofovir, other acyclic nucleoside phosphonates, such as cPrPMEDAP (N 6 -cyclopropyl-9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)-2,6-diaminopurine, 2), are being explored for their potential in the treatment of HPV-associated papillomas and dysplasias. 2,3 These compounds have been shown to specifically induce apoptosis in HPV-infected cells, which, in turn, may be related to their ability to restore the function of the tumor suppressor proteins p53 and pRb (which are neutralized by the oncoproteins E6 and E7, respectively, in HPV-infected cells). Recently, biphenylsulfonacetic acid derivatives have been described as inhibitors of HPV E1 helicaseassociated ATP hydrolysis. 4, 5 Although these novel ATPase inhibitors can hardly be considered to be good drug candidates, they may serve as leads for further optimization as potential antiviral agents active against multiple HPV types. 5 ",

            "text": "For the treatment of adenovirus infections, which can be quite severe in immunocompromised patients (e.g., allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplant recipients), no antiviral drugs have been officially approved. Anecdotal reports have pointed to the efficacy of cidofovir against adenovirus infections in such patients. 2 Among the novel compounds that could be further explored for the treatment of adenovirus infections are (S)-2,4-diamino-6-[3-hydroxy-2-phosphonomethoxy)propoxy]pyrimidine (HPMPO-DAPy), 3), 3 which akin to some 'older' compounds like (S)-9-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphono-methoxypropyl)adenine (HPMPA), the N7-substituted acyclic nucleoside 2-amino-7-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxymethyl)purine S-2242, the 2 0 ,3 0 -dideoxynucleosides zalcitabine (ddC) and alovudine (FddT, FLT) have been found to inhibit adenovirus replication in vitro. 6 Also, ether lipid-ester (hexadecyloxypropyl (HDP) and octadecyloxyethyl (ODE)) prodrugs of HPMPC For the treatment of HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV, a number of compounds have been approved: acyclovir (4) and its oral prodrug valaciclovir (5); penciclovir (6) and its oral prodrug famciclovir (7); idoxuridine (8), trifluridine (9) , and brivudin (10) . Penciclovir, idoxuridine, and trifluridine are used topically, primarily in the treatment of herpes labialis (penciclovir) and herpetic keratitis (idoxuridine, trifluridine). Acyclovir can be used orally, intravenously, or topically, whereas valaciclovir and famciclovir are administered orally, in the treatment of both HSV and VZV infections. Brivudin (available in some European countries) is used orally for the treatment of herpes zoster, but is also effective against HSV-1 infections. While acyclovir (and its oral prodrug valaciclovir) have remained the gold standard for the treatment of HSV and VZV infections, few attempts have been made to bring other anti-HSV (or anti-VZV) agents into the clinic, with the exception of the H2G prodrug (11) , which after quite a number of years is still in clinical development for the treatment of herpes zoster. 8 Worth considering for clinical development as anti-HSV (and anti-VZV) agents are a number of carbocyclic guanosine analogs, such as A-5021 (12) , cyclohexenylguanine, and the methylene cyclopropane synguanol (13) . 9 All these compounds owe their selective antiviral activity to a specific phosphorylation by the HSV-or VZV-encoded thymidine kinase (TK); upon phosphorylation to their triphosphate form, they act as chain terminators in the DNA polymerization reaction. In the (rare) circumstances that HSV or VZV becomes resistant to the acyclic (or carbocyclic) guanosine analogs due to TK deficiency (TK \u00c0 ), the pyrophosphate analog foscarnet (14) could be useful for treating TK \u00c0 HSV or TK \u00c0 VZV infections (in immunocompromised patients). Recently, a second generation of methylene cyclopropane analogs, the 2,2-bishydroxymethyl derivatives, has been synthesized. 10 These compounds may have potential, not only for the treatment of HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV, but also beta-herpes (CMV, HHV-6, HHV-7) and gamma-herpes (EBV, HHV-8) infections. 11 In particular, ZSM-I-62 (Cyclopropavir) (15) has been reported to be very effective in reducing mortality of mice infected with murine CMV. 12 New anti-HSV agents targeting the viral helicase-primase complex, the thiazolylphenyl derivatives BILS 179BS and BAY 57-1293 (16) , were recently reported to have in vivo efficacy in animal models of HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections. 13, 14 These compounds seem to function by diminishing the affinity of the helicase-primase complex for the HSV DNA. The antiviral potency of BAY 57-1293 was claimed to be superior to all compounds that are currently used to treat HSV infections. 15 If so, this lead should be further pursued from a clinical viewpoint.

These compounds are exquisitely active against VZV. 16 They inhibit the replication of VZV, but not that of other viruses (including HSV), at subnanomolar concentrations, with a selectivity index in excess of 100 000. 17 Given the extremely high potency and selectivity of the BCNAs they warrant to be further developed toward clinical use, e.g., against herpes zoster. Five compounds have been licensed to treat CMV infections: ganciclovir (18), its oral prodrug valganciclovir (19) , foscarnet (14) , cidofovir (1), and fomivirsen (20) . With the exception of fomivirsen (an antisense oligonucleotide) which targets the CMV immediate-early mRNA, all other licensed anti-CMV drugs target the viral DNA polymerase. Ganciclovir must first be phosphorylated by the CMV-encoded protein kinase (the UL97 gene product) which is also the principal site for mutations engendering resistance toward this compound. Toxic side effects (i.e., bone-marrow suppression for ganciclovir, nephrotoxicity for foscarnet and cidofovir Several benzimidazole ribonucleosides, including maribavir (previously also known as 1263W94) (21) , have been accredited with specific activity against human CMV. Maribavir seems to target the UL97 protein kinase, 19 and, as the UL97 gene product has been shown to account for the release of CMV nucleocapsids from the nucleus, 20 maribavir may be assumed to target a stage in the viral life cycle that follows viral DNA maturation and packaging. Preclinical pharmacokinetic and toxicological studies have shown that maribavir has a favorable safety profile and excellent oral bioavailability. 21 Phase I/II dose-escalation trials in HIV-infected men with asymptomatic CMV shedding further indicated that maribavir is rapidly absorbed following oral dosing and reduces CMV titers in semen. 22 While maribavir is primarily active against CMV, 2-chloro-3-pyridin-3-yl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroindolizine-1-carboxamide (CMV 423) (22) has potent and selective in vitro activity against all three human beta-herpesviruses, CMV, HHV-6, and HHV-7. 23 As compared to ganciclovir and foscarnet, CMV 423 has higher antiviral potency and lower cytotoxicity. It is targeted at an early stage of the viral replication cycle (following viral entry but preceding viral DNA replication), which is regulated by a cellular process that may involve protein tyrosine kinase activity. The in vitro antiviral action profile of CMV 423 is such that it deserves to further explored for its in vivo potential in the treatment of CMV and HHV-6 infections. ",

            "text": "Taking into account the duration of the combined interferon plus ribavirin treatment, the therewith associated side effects and costs, and the partial responses observed with this treatment regimen, fierce attempts have been made, rightfully, to develop more selective anti-HCV agents, targeted at specific viral proteins such as the NS3 protease and RNA helicase, and the NS5B RNA replicase (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase). Also the HCV p7 protein, which forms an ion channel and can be blocked by long-alkyl-chain iminosugar derivatives, has been considered as a potential target for antiviral therapy. 74 Proof of principle that compounds targeted at the NS3 protease could reduce plasma concentrations of HCV RNA has already been delivered with BILN 2061 (44) administered orally for no longer than 2 days in patients infected with HCV genotype 1. 75 BILN 2061 (Ciluprevir) was able to reduce HCV RNA levels by 2-3 log 10 in patients infected with HCV genotype 1, after 2 days of treatment, 76 Another NS3 protease inhibitor, which differs in its in vitro resistance profile from BILN 2061, is VX-950 (45) 78 : i.e., the major BILN 2061-resistant mutations at Asp168 are fully susceptible to VX-950, and similarly, the dominant resistant mutation against VX-950 at Ala156 remains sensitive to BILN 2061. 78 Thus, VX-950 and BILN 2061 elicit resistance to HCV protease (NS3A) by different mechanisms. 79 VX-950 (750 mg every 8 h) was found to achieve, at the end of a 14-day treatment, a main reduction of HCV RNA of 4.4 log 10 . (In some patients dosed with VX-950, the virus became undetectable at day 14 of dosing.) The overall preclinical profile of VX-950 supports its candidacy as a novel oral therapy against hepatitis C. 80 Other HCV NS3 protease inhibitors may be announced in the future as behaving similarly. 72 Various other 7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid-based macrocyclic inhibitors of HCV NS3 protease 81 as well as SCH 503034 (46), a mechanism-based inhibitor of HCV NS3 protease, 82 are in preclinical development. In fact, the latter was found to act synergistically with a-interferon in suppressing HCV replicon synthesis. 82 In addition to the NS3 protease, the NS5B RNA replicase has also been perceived as an attractive target for the development of HCV inhibitors. Highly potent and selective antiviral agents targeted at the viral RNA replicase have been described to inhibit the replication of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), a pestivirus which could be considered as a surrogate virus for HCV. 83, 84 We have recently described a novel series of compounds (prototype: 5-[(4-bromophenyl)methyl]-2-phenyl-5H-imidazo [4,5-c] pyridine (BPIP, 47)) that act as 'nonnucleoside' RNA replicase inhibitors (NNRRIs) and effect a highly potent and selective inhibition of the replication of BVDV. 85 From the BPIP class of compounds, new congeners have been derived that act equally efficiently against HCV replication. In future treatment strategies for HCV infections, these NNRRIs may likely to be combined with 'nucleoside' RNA replicase inhibitors (NRRIs), in analogy with the strategy followed for the treatment of HIV infections, where NRTIs are combined with NNRTIs (see below).",

In a certain sense they may be considered as 'pyrophosphate mimics,' acting as product-like inhibitors of the polymerase reaction. 89 105 The allosteric binding site for some of these compounds have already been identified by crystallographic studies. 101, 102 It corresponds to a narrow cleft on the protein's surface in the 'thumb' domain, about 3.0-3.5 nm from the enzyme's catalytic center. 101, 102 Curiously, most of the NNRRIs that are active against the HCV NS5B polymerase contain, besides a large hydrophobic region, a carboxylic acid group (or a similar motif) that allows hydrogen bonding with main chain amide nitrogen atoms (i.e., Ser476 and Tyr477, as demonstrated for the phenylalanine derivative Mutations conferring resistance to both the HCV NS5B RNA replicase (i.e., H95Q, N411S, M414L, M414T, or Y448H) and NS3 protease (i.e., A156 V or D168 V) have been identified. 105 These mutations conferred high levels of resistance to A-782759 and BILN 2061, respectively. However, the A-782759-resistant mutants remained susceptible to the NRRIs and other classes of NNRRIs, as well as interferon. In addition, the dually (A-782759-and BILN 2061-) resistant mutants displayed significantly reduced replicative ability as compared to the wild-type. These findings support a rationale for drug combinations in the therapy of HCV infections. 105 As recently reviewed, 72 several other approaches, including ribozymes, antisense oligonucleotides, and RNA interference (RNAi) based on small interfering (si)RNAs could be envisaged to target the HCV genome. In particular, siRNAs aimed at posttranscriptional gene silencing may be considered an attractive approach. 106 ",

To the extent that this fusion process bears resemblance to the fusogenic mechanism of HIV, i.e., with regard to heptad repeat interactions and six-helix bundle formation, it might be feasible to develop SARS coronavirus inhibitors, analogous to the HIV fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide. 110 Following receptor binding and induced conformational changes in the spike glycoprotein, a third step would be involved in the viral entry process, namely cathepsin L proteolysis within endosomes. 111 The cathepsin-L-specific inhibitor, MDL 28170 (also known as calpain inhibitor III (62), or Z-Val-Phe(CHO)), at the same time inhibited cathepsin L activity and S protein-mediated infection (at IC 50 of 2.5 nM and 0.1 mM, respectively). In addition to calpain inhibitor III, some other calpain inhibitors have been described as inhibitors of SARS coronavirus replication, the most selective (selectivity index 4100) being calpain inhibitor VI (4-fluorophenylsulfonyl-Val-Leu(CHO),63). 112 The crystal structure of the SARS coronavirus protease has been revealed. 113, 114 This offers a solid basis for the rational drug design of SARS protease inhibitors.

For example, the phe-phe dipeptide inhibitor (65) was found to inhibit the 3C-like protease at an IC 50 of 1 mM and inhibited virus replication in Vero cells at an EC 50 of 0.18 mM, while not being toxic to the host cells at a concentration of 200 mM (selectivity index 41000). 116 An octapeptide specifically designed for the SARS coronavirus main protease, namely AVLQSGFR, was reported to inhibit SARS coronavirus replication in Vero cells at an EC 50 of 0.027 mg mL \u00c0 1 , while not being cytotoxic at 100 mg mL \u00c0 1 , thus establishing a selectivity index of 43700. 117 Whether this highly selective antiviral effect was actually mediated by an inhibition of the SARS coronavirus main protease was not ascertained in this study. 117 The SARS coronavirus NTPase/helicase has been considered a potential target for the development of anti-SARS agents. 118 Bananin (66) and three of its derivatives (iodobananin, vanillinbananin, and eubananin) were shown to inhibit both the ATPase and helicase activity of the SARS coronavirus NTPase/helicase, with IC 50 values (for the ATPase activity) in the range of 0.5-3 mM. 119 Bananin was also found to inhibit SARS-CoV replication in fetal rhesus kidney (FRhK-4) cells at an EC 50 of less than 10 mM and a CC 50 of over 300 mM, thus exhibiting a selectivity index of over 30. 119 Wheter the antiviral effect obtained in cell culture was causally linked to inhibition of the NTPase/helicase was not ascertained. The SARS coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), because of its pivotal role in viral replication, represents another potential target for anti-SARS therapy. This enzyme does not contain a hydrophobic pocket for nonnucleoside inhibitors similar to those that have proven effective against the HCV polymerase or HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. 120 In fact, nonnucleoside HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitors were shown to have no evident inhibitory effect on SARS coronavirus RdRp activity. 121 At present, few, if any, nucleoside analogs have been recognized as specific inhibitors of the SARS coronavirus RdRp. There is N 4 -hydroxycytidine, which has been accredited with both anti-HCV and anti-SARS coronavirus effects. Against SARS coronavirus it proved active at an EC 50 of 10 mM (selectivity index X10). 112 Whether this antiviral effect was mediated by an inhibition of the viral RdRp was not ascertained, however.",

Zanamivir, which must be taken through (oral) inhalation, and, in particular, oseltamivir, which can be more conveniently administered as oral capsules, should be stockpiled to confront a potential influenza pandemic in the future. 143, 144 With the increasing threat of the avian flu, the need for a sufficient supply of neuraminidase inhibitors, such as oseltamivir and zanamivir, has become extremely urgent. In comparison with the neuraminidase inhibitors, the existing influenza vaccines are likely to be of limited value against newly emerging influenza virus strains.",

            "text": "In fact, both peramivir (RWJ-270201) and A-315675 proved effective against a panel of five zanamivir-resistant and six oseltamivir-resistant A and B influenza virus strains. 151 Oseltamivir resistance in clinical isolates of human influenza A has been associated with mutations at positions 119, 198, 274, 292 , or 294 of the neuraminidase. Recently, resistance of avian influenza A H 5 N 1 against oseltamivir was shown to be caused by the H274Y mutation. 152, 153 The H274Y variant still appeared sensitive to zanamivir. 152 Prominent among the other neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant influenza A (H 3 N 2 ) virus mutations (not yet demonstrated for H 5 N 1 ) are E119 V and R292K: whereas the R292K mutation was associated with compromised virus growth and transmissibility, the growth and transmissibility of the E119 V variant were comparable to those of wild-type virus. 154 Are there other antiviral agents, besides amantadine, rimantadine, and the neuraminidase inhibitors, that may be considered for their potential, in the prevention and/or therapy, of influenza A virus infections, including avian influenza? Ribavirin has since long been recognized as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent, with particular activity against both orthoand paramyxoviruses. 155 Recently, viramidine, the carboxamidine analog of ribavirin, was shown to have efficacy similar to ribavirin against influenza virus infections, and considering its lesser toxicity, viramidine may warrant further evaluation as a possible therapy for influenza, including H 5 N 1 . 156 Yet, other recently described compounds with specific activity against influenza A, B, and C viruses are T-705 (6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazine carboxamide, 79) and the 2,6-diketopiperazine flutimide (80) , which would target the viral polymerase 157 and cap-dependent endonuclease, 158 respectively. Of the paramyxoviruses, parainfluenza (types 1-5) has received little attention from either a preventative or curative viewpoint; mumps and measles, like the rubellivirus rubella, are now sufficiently contained by vaccination, which makes respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and Nipah the paramyxoviruses with the greatest need for antiviral therapy. For RSV the only approved antiviral therapy is aerosol administration of ribavirin. In practice, however, ribavirin is rarely used owing to the technical burden of delivery by aerosol under the given circumstances (RSV bronchopneumonitis in young infants). Given the high incidence of RSV infections (which are often diagnosed as influenza), there is a high (and as yet unmet) medical need for an appropriate therapy (and prophylaxis) of RSV infections; the same holds for hMPV infections, which usually occur during the same (winter) season as RSV, mainly in young children, elderly people, and immunocompromised individuals. Ribavirin certainly holds promise for the treatment of hMPV infections, as has recently been demonstrated in the mouse model for hMPV. 159 Also, as has been mentioned above for HCV, 106 siRNA may also be applicable, if properly designed and administered (intranasally) in the treatment of respiratory virus infections. 160 Recently, a number of small molecules, e.g., VP-14637 (81) and JNJ-2408068 (82) (formerly known as R-170591), although structurally dissimilar, have been shown to fit into a small hydrophobic cavity in the inner core of the RSV fusion (F) protein, thereby interacting with the heptad repeats HR1 and HR2 domains, and to inhibit RSV fusion. [161] [162] [163] [164] Although the therapeutic potential of these compounds in the treatment of RSV infections is presently unclear, there is no doubt that further exploration of the mechanism of interaction between these inhibitors and the F protein should facilitate the design of new RSV fusion inhibitors. 161 BMS-433771 (83) was found to be a potent inhibitor of RSV replication in vitro 165 ; it exhibited excellent potency against multiple laboratory and clinical isolates of both A and B RSV with an average EC 50 of 20 nM. BMS-433771 inhibits fusion the (viral and cellular) lipid membranes during both the early and virus entry stage and late-stage syncytium formation. 165 BMS-433771 was shown to be orally active against RSV in BALB/c mice and cotton rats, even if administered as a single oral dose 1 h prior to intranasal RSV inoculation. 166 It could be considered the prototype of lowmolecular-weight inhibitors that target the formation of the six helical coiled-coil bundles as a prelude to virus-cell fusion, not only of RSV but also HIV. 167 Although human parainfluenza viruses are important respiratory tract pathogens, especially in children, they have received little attention from either prophylactic (vaccine) or therapeutic viewpoint. Yet, they contain a unique target, the major surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) that serves, at the same time, for cell attachment and virus spread. The HN inhibitors BCX-2798 (84) and BCX-2855 (85) were found to inhibit both functions, and to block infection with parainfluenza viruses both in vitro and in vivo. 168 These compounds may limit parainfluenza virus infections in humans. Other compounds that may be further pursued for their activity against parainfluenza viruses, RSV, as well as influenza viruses, include flavonoids, 169 uncinosides, 170 172 Ribavirin has proven to be effective in postexposure prophylaxis and therapy of experimental arenavirus infections in animal models, and anecdotal reports suggest that it might also be effective in the treatment of arenavirus infections (i.e., Machupo and Sabia) in humans. 172 The most convincing evidence for the (clinical) efficacy was obtained in the case of Lassa fever, where it was found to reduce the case-fatality rate, irrespective of the time point in the illness when treatment was started. 173",

            "text": "No antiviral drugs that are currently in clinical use, including ribavirin, provide meaningful protection against filoviruses in vivo. 178 A possible therapeutic strategy may be based on the use of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase inhibitors. 122 SAH hydrolase inhibitors, such as 3-deazaneplanocin A (86), interfere with S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)dependent methylation reactions, particularly those involved in the 'capping' of viral mRNA. Some viruses, such as the rhabdovirus vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), rely heavily on mRNA capping and are particularly sensitive to inhibition by SAH hydrolase inhibitors, including 3-deazaneplanocin A. 179 As, biochemically, filo-and rhabdoviruses are quite similar in their replication machinery, both requiring 5 0 -capping of their mRNAs, SAH hydrolase inhibitors such as 3-deazaneplanocin A may logically be expected to be effective in the treatment of Ebola virus infections. In fact, when administered as a single dose of 1 mg kg \u00c0 1 , 3-deazaneplanocin A was found to protect mice against a lethal infection with Ebola virus (Zaire strain). 180, 181 This protective effect was accompanied, and probably mediated, by the production of high concentrations of interferon in the Ebola virus-infected mice. 181 It can be hypothesized that, by blocking the 5 0 -capping of the nascent ( \u00fe )RNA viral strands (and, hence, their maturation toward mRNAs), 3-deazaneplanocin A stimulated the formation of double-stranded (7)RNA complexes, which have long been known to be excellent inducers of interferon. 182 Like SAH hydrolase, inosine monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase is another cellular enzyme that may be envisaged as a target for antiviral agents. IMP dehydrogenase is a crucial enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of GTP, and, although ribavirin may act against distinct viruses by distinct mechanisms (e.g., IMP dehydrogenase inhibition, immunomodulatory effect, RNA capping interference, polymerase inhibition, lethal mutagenesis), 183 the predominant mechanism by which ribavirin exerts its antiviral activity in vitro against flaviviruses and paramyxoviruses is mediated by inhibition of IMP dehydrogenase. 184 Recently, a new class of compounds, phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO), conjugated to arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides (P-PMO) and designed to base pair with the translation start region of Ebolavirus VP35 positive-sense RNA, were reported to inhibit Ebolavirus replication and to protect mice against a lethal Ebolavirus infection. 185 ",

            "text": "About 40 compounds are registered as antiviral drugs, at least half of which are used to treat HIV infections. An even greater number of compounds are under clinical or preclinical development, with again, as many targeting HIV as all the other viruses taken together. This implies that HIV, since its advent, has remained the main target in antiviral drug development. Antiviral agents can, as guided by the anti-HIV agents as examples, be divided in roughly five categories: (1) nucleoside analogs, (2) nucleotide analogs (or acyclic nucleoside phosphonates), (3) nonnucleoside analogs, (4) protease inhibitors, and (5) virus-cell fusion inhibitors. Molecular targets are for (1) and (2) the viral DNA polymerase (whether DNA-dependent as in the case of herpesviruses, or RNA-dependent as in the case of HIV or HBV); for (3) RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase), associated with HIV, or RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNA replicase) associated with HCV; for (4) the proteases associated with HIV and HCV; and for (5) the fusion process of HIV (and, potentially, other viruses such as the SARS coronavirus and RSV). Antiviral agents may also exert their antiviral effects through an interaction with cellular targets such as IMP dehydrogenase (ribavirin) and SAH hydrolase (3-deazaneplanocin A). The latter enzymes are essential for viral RNA synthesis (through the supply of GTP) and viral mRNA maturation (through 5 0 -capping), respectively. Finally, interferons (now generally provided in their pegylated form) may be advocated in the therapy of those viral infections (actually, HBV and HCV; prospectively, Coxsackie B, SARS, y) that, as yet, cannot be sufficiently curbed by other therapeutic measures. titular of the Prof P De Somer Chair for Microbiology. He teaches the courses of Cell Biology, Biochemistry, and Microbiology at the K U Leuven (and Kortrijk) Medical School. Professor De Clercq is the co-inventor of Gilead's nucleotide analogs cidofovir, adefovir, and tenofovir and received the Hoechst Marion Roussel (now called 'Aventis') award, the Maisin Prize for Biomedical Sciences (National Science Foundation, Belgium), R Descartes Prize (European Union Commission), and B Pascal Award (European Academy of Sciences) for his pioneering efforts in the field of antiviral research. His scientific interests are in the antiviral chemotherapy field, and, in particular, the development of new antiviral agents for various viral infections, including HSV, VZV, CMV, HIV, HBV, HPV, and HCV.",
