Preventive Veterinary Medicine 24 (1995) 213-228 Management and demographic factors associated with seropositivity to transmissible gastroenteritis virus in US swine herds, [1989][1990] Abstract Serum neutralization testing was used to determine transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) titers of up to 10 sows per herd (mean 8.7, median 10) for 392 herds that participated in the 3 month monitoring of sows and litters in the National Swine Survey. Of the sampled herds, 101 (25.8%) had sow seroprevalences of at least 80%, 79 (20.1%) had seroprevalences between 10 and 79%, and 212 (54.1%) were seronegative. For evaluation of risk factors for TGE seropositivity, analysis was restricted to herds with at least five tested sows and either 0% or at least 20% seropositive sows. In the logistic regression analysis, a herd was considered seropositive if at least 20% of sampled females had titers of 1:8 or higher (n = 160), and a herd was seronegative if all females had titers of under I:8 (n = 178). Factors considered for inclusion in logistic regression models included breeding herd size, biosecurity measures, pig introductions and movements, and access of possible nonporcine reservoirs to the facilities with pigs. After controlling for the effects of season, number of samples tested and TGE vaccination history, large female breeding herd size (at least 500 sows compared with the reference category of 100-199 sows) and purchase of more than 25 pigs from non-specific pathogen free (SPF) herds were associated with significantly (P < 0.05) higher odds of herd seropositivity (odds ratios 4.9 and 3.9, respectively). There was some evidence (P = 0.08) of an increased risk of seropositivity when there were more than two swine herds within a 3 mile radius of the study herd. * Corresponding author. 0167-5877/95/$09.50 0 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

This seasonal occurrence has been attributed to increased survival of the virus at colder temperatures (Siegel et al., 199 1) and the tendency for pigs to develop diarrhea because of low or fluctuating temperatures. Pigs with diarrhea probably shed greater amounts of TGE virus than subclinically infected animals (Shimuzu and Shimuzu, 1978) , and hence, challenge doses are probably greater also during winter months.",

Epizootic TGE generally develops when the virus is first introduced into a susceptible herd but is usually of short duration and no longer clinically evident after herd immunity develops. On the other hand, enzootic TGE occurs when virus persists in a partially immune herd into which susceptible swine are introduced (Bohl, 1989; Saif and Wesley, 1991) . Recrudescence of clinical TGE often occurs in enzootically infected herds about 9 months after the first outbreak as offspring of susceptible sows are exposed to the virus. TGE recrudescence has been associated with breeding herd sizes of over 100 sows, the presence of finishing pigs in large herds, and the introduction of purchased gilts (Pritchard, 1987) . Parity (parity 3 on farm 1, parity 1 on farm 2), the use of purchased versus homebred gilts, and the use of multiple boar matings increased the risk of TGE on two Illinois farms (Siegel et al., 1991) , but to our knowledge there are no previous largescale population-based studies that have quantified the risk associated with herd-level management factors.",

The primary outcome that influenced the number of herds to be sampled (and hence the number of litters to be monitored) was preweaning mortality. In states with large swine populations, herds were generally ineligible to participate if they expected less than ten litters to farrow during the following 3 month monitoring period. In states with relatively small numbers of swine herds, this restriction was not imposed. For herds with over 100 expected farrowings in the 3 month period, a random subsampling procedure (USDA:APHIS:VS, 1992) was used to select buildings and rooms for monitoring.",

This finding is consistent with another study (Pritchard, 1987 ) that also found a positive association between herd size and TGE recrudescence with the greatest risk in herds with more than 300 sows. Using data from Pritchard's study, we calculated that English herds with 101-300 and more than 300 sows were at 4.7 and 14.2 times higher odds, respectively, of TGE recrudescence than those with 100 sows or more. Herds of over 50 breeding pigs in Spain also had a higher prevalence of TGE than smaller herds (Cuber0 et al., 1993)) but breeding herd sizes are typically smaller in Spain than in the United States or England. Demonstration of a herd size association is also consistent with the clinical impression of many swine producers and veterinarians in the United States that chronic TGE seems to occur more often in herds of more than about 200-500 sows. In large breeding herds, some susceptible females may not be exposed to infection during a primary outbreak of TGE (Pritchard, 1987) . These females fail to transfer adequate colostral antibodies to suckling piglets which are often at the greatest risk of infection (Pritchard, 1982) . A greater odds of TGE seropositivity might also occur in large herds because the absolute number of replacement females increases usually as herd size increases. Theoretically, a larger pool of susceptible females will facilitate circulation of the virus and hence the persistence of infection in the herd.",

Indeed, the frequency of hiring a truck (NRTRKHIR) and the number of feed deliveries on farm (NRDLVON), were positively associated with large herd size when taken individually, but they failed to enter or remain in models after controlling for other variables. Uncleaned trucks or boots and other clothing used by truckers might be sources of virus for previously noninfected herds. Other unmeasured but important management factors that might occur more frequently in large herds, such as manure or fecal feedback, might also partially explain the herd size association. Pritchard (1987) also attributed part of the herd size association with TGE recrudescence to continuous farrowings and early weaning of piglets.",

Herds that purchased more than 25 non-SPF pigs were about 3.9 times more likely to be seropositive to TGE than those that bought fewer non-SPF pigs. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that non-SPF herds are more likely to be infected with TGE than SPF herds, and therefore, pigs purchased from the former herds are more likely to be carriers of virus. Previous studies (Morin et al., 1974; Underdahl et al., 1976) have shown that TGE virus can be recovered from the intestine or lungs of feeder pigs for up to 4 months after infection. The TGE status of herds supplying pigs to the study herds was not known, but owners who in this study described themselves primarily as producers of breeding stock (SPF or non-SPF status was not specified) sometimes (5 / 14) had seropositive herds.",

Less than 50% of producers who introduced breeding pigs 'health tested' new additions prior to entry into the herd. The type of health tests was not described in the database so we were unable to specifically determine whether introduced pigs were tested for TGE. When breeding pigs were quarantined on introduction, the duration was typically less than 40 days (USDA:APHIS:VS, 1992) which would be insufficient to prevent entry of TGE virus with untested carrier pigs. Another potential explanation for the lack of association was that most seropositive herds were probably chronically rather than recently infected. Pritchard (1987) concluded that TGE recrudescence and presumably a high level of seropositivity resulted from the introduction of susceptible pigs into an enzootically infected herd rather than the introduction of a carrier pig into an previously noninfected herd.",

Because some factors such as footbath and showering requirements were infrequent (less than lo%), the power to detect significant differences in the ORs for some biosecurity variables was low.

A herd may have vaccinated because of a previous history of TGE or as insurance against severe clinical disease following introduction of TGE. Some evidence for the latter hypothesis is that 56 producers, who claimed freedom from TGE and reported no history of disease in the last 12 months, reported using TGE vaccine. Seropositivity in TGE vaccinated sows may have been caused by vaccination alone or by a combination of vaccination and field infection. Serum neutralization titers following vaccination are usually lower than postinfection titers and seldom exceed 1: 16 in the absence of natural exposure (Hill, 1988) . Because there was no unequivocal way to differentiate titers from vaccination from those due to natural exposure, vaccination status was included in logistic models. Also, the potential influence of vaccination on TGE seropositivity could have been better evaluated if the farm's TGE history over a longer period (3-5 years) were known and if the type of vaccine (killed or modified-live) had been recorded.",

A more important limitation of the SN test was its potential inability to distinguish PRCV from TGE virus in some pigs and herds. Unlike enteropathogenic TGEV, PRCV infects the respiratory rather than the intestinal tract Van Nieuwstadt and Boonstra, 1992) . Infection with PRCV induces antibodies that also neutralize TGE in vitro and, hence, the SN test may have failed to differentiate between TGE and PRCV infections. Other more specific tests, such as the blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Callebaut et al., 1989; Van Nieuwstadt and Boonstra, 1992) ) may assist serologic differentiation of PRCV from TGEV. The blocking ELISA is more expensive, however, and for cost reasons could not be used for a national survey involving many samples.",
