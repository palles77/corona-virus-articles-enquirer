            "text": "Recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses (rVSVs) are being developed as potential HIV-1 vaccine candidates. To characterize the in vivo replication and dissemination of rVSV vectors in mice, high doses of a highly attenuated vector expressing HIV-1 Gag, rVSV IN -N4CT9-Gag1, and a prototypic reference virus, rVSV IN -HIVGag5, were delivered intramuscularly (IM), intranasally (IN), or intravenously (IV). We used quantitative, real-time RT-PCR (Q-PCR) and standard plaque assays to measure the temporal dissemination of these viruses to various tissues. Following IM inoculation, both viruses were detected primarily at the injection site as well as in draining lymph nodes; neither virus induced significant weight loss, pathologic signs, or evidence of neuroinvasion. In contrast, following IN inoculation, the prototypic virus was detected in all tissues tested and caused significant weight loss leading to death. IN administration of rVSV IN -N4CT9-Gag1 resulted in detection in numerous tissues (brain, lung, nasal turbinates, and lymph nodes) albeit in significantly reduced levels, which caused little or no weight loss nor any mortality. Following IV inoculation, both prototypic and attenuated viruses were detected by Q-PCR in all tissues tested. In contrast to the prototype, rVSV IN -N4CT9-Gag1 viral loads were significantly lower in all organs tested, and no infectious virus was detected in the brain following IV inoculation, despite the presence of viral RNA. These studies demonstrated significant differences in the biodistribution patterns of and the associated pathogenicity engendered by the prototypic and attenuated vectors in a highly susceptible host.",

The two most common serotypes of VSV in the western hemisphere are designated as Indiana (VSV IN ) and New Jersey (VSV NJ ). In nature, VSV infects livestock causing a self-limiting disease. Although naturally occurring human infections with VSV are rare, VSV infections have been reported for individuals directly exposed to infected livestock, within laboratory environments, and living within endemic regions [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . VSV infection of humans is typically either asymptomatic or causes a mild influenza-like illness [6] . Among small mammals, mice are readily infected experimentally via a variety of inoculation routes and thus have served as a tractable model for immunogenicity, pathogenicity, neurotropism and neurovirulence studies [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] .",

Most of these studies were conducted with prototypic, recombinant VSV (rVSV) vectors that were derived from tissue culture-passaged, wild type (wt) VSV strains, which were shown to be somewhat attenuated when compared to the wt VSV [23] . More recently, in a non-human primate model for neurovirulence, we showed that the prototypic rVSV vectors caused a significant level of neuropathology following direct intrathalamic injection, albeit at reduced levels compared to the wild type virus [24] . These observations led to the conclusion that the prototypic rVSV vectors required further attenuation and preclinical analysis prior to clinical evaluation.",

            "text": "In the process of generating rVSVs with reduced vector pathogenicity, we developed a highly attenuated rVSV vector expressing the HIV-1 Gag gene, rVSV IN -N4CT9-Gag1, which was made by combining three attenuating approaches: insertion of HIV-1 Gag gene in the first position of the genome, shuffling of VSV N gene to the fourth position (N4) and use of a VSV G with its cytoplasmic tail truncated from 29 to 9 amino acids (CT9) [25] [26] [27] . Because there is an established gradient of transcription for VSV in which genes proximal to the single 3 genomic promoter are expressed to the highest levels with a decrease in transcription for each gene as its distance from this promoter increases [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] , we anticipated high levels of Gag expression, a concomitant reduction in VSV N expression, and a high degree of attenuation for the rVSV IN -N4CT9-Gag1 vector as compared to the prototypic rVSV. Indeed, the in vivo attenuation of rVSV IN -N4CT9-Gag1 was characterized by a dramatic rise in the mouse LD 50 following intracranial (IC) inoculation [34] . However, this vector retained the ability to grow in vitro to high titers, and was capable of inducing immune responses in mice and macaques that were comparable to those obtained with the prototypic vector, rVSV-HIVGag5 ( [34] , and unpublished observations).",

Notably, there is no experience with administration of rVSV vectors to humans, and when human infection with VSV does occur, it is not known which tissues are affected nor how the infection spreads. Therefore, we assessed the in vivo distribution and replication of prototypic (rVSV IN -HIVGag5) and attenuated (rVSV IN -N4CT9-Gag1) rVSV vectors in mice following three different routes of administration: intramuscular (IM), intranasal (IN), and intravenous (IV). The IM and IN routes were chosen because they have been considered for clinical evaluation. Furthermore, we tested the IV route to evaluate the effects of widespread dissemination of the viruses [35] . As an increased stringency parameter, we used a high dose of rVSV vectors in these studies, 10 8 plaque forming units (PFU) per animal.",

Mice were either euthanized by inhalation of CO 2 (for IM study) or anesthetized as described above and perfused (for IV and IN studies). In the latter case, death was achieved by the exsanguination caused by the perfusion. For perfusion, animals were placed in dorsal recumbency, the abdomen was wet with alcohol, and an incision was then made at the abdominal midline. The thoracic cavity was opened exposing the heart and lungs. A 20-21 gauge needle was then attached to a fluid bag containing PBS with an IV set. The needle was put into the apex of the left ventricle. The fluid line was then opened fully. The right auricle was then snipped. Sufficient fluid (maximum 100 mL) was then allowed to pump through the vasculature to evacuate all blood from the animal. The following organs were harvested from mice and tested for the presence of VSV RNA or virus: brain, liver, lung, kidney, spleen, muscle (corresponding to injection site for IM route, in the IM and IV studies only), nasal turbinates (IN studies only) and draining lymph nodes (popliteal, inguinal, and iliac for IM; and cervical for IN).

Briefly, detection of viral genomic RNA (negative sense) was done in a 20-L reaction mix containing total RNA from tissue samples (5.0 L or 0.5 g), VSV N and the large ribosomal protein L15 housekeeping gene (RPLO) forward primers, and reagents from the Sensiscript Reverse Transcriptase kit (Qiagen). To detect mRNA transcripts, 10 M of the anchored oligo-dT primer was substituted for the VSV N specific-forward primer. Otherwise, the reagents and the conditions for the reverse transcription step remained as described. Primer and probe sets for detecting RNA encoding VSV N and HIV Gag and the primer nucleotide sequence for the anchored oligo-dT primer have been previously described [36] . The primer-probe set RPLO was selected using the Primer Express software version 2.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA) and contained the following sequences: forward primer, 5 -GCCAGCTCAGAACACTGGTCTAG-3 (anneals between residues 443 and 465); reverse primer, 5 -ATGCCCAAAGCCTGGAAGA-3 (anneals between residues 484 and 502); TaqMan probe, 5 -CCGAGAAGACCTCC-3 (anneals between residues 469 and 482). The duplex quantitative real-time PCR to detect genomic RNA was carried out using the QuantiTect Multiplex PCR Kit (Qiagen). A 30-L PCR reaction containing 5 L of each 10-fold dilution of the VSV N, HIV Gag, and RPLO cDNA used to generate standard curves or 5 L of cDNA from tissue samples, 15 L of 2\u00d7 QuantiTect Multiplex PCR Master Mix, 400 nM each of the forward and reverse primers for VSV N and RPLO, and 200 nM of each probe. For the duplex assay to detect mRNA from cDNA, the reaction mix remained the same except HIV Gag and RPLO forward and reverse primers and probes were used. In order to distinguish the amplicons, the probes for VSV-N were labeled with FAM (6carboxyfluorescein), HIV-Gag with VIC (6-carboxyrhodamine 6G), and RPLO with NED. Amplification and detection were performed with an ABI Prism 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System using the following conditions: 15 min at 95 \u2022 C to activate the HotStar Taq DNA polymerase, followed by 40 cycles of 60 s at 94 \u2022 C and 90 s at 60 \u2022 C.

While the neurovirulence associated with VSV infection in mice has been well studied, there has not been much advancement in the understanding of the biodistribution of VSV in mice since the pioneering work of Sabin and Olitsky in the 1930s [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] . Presently, we used highly sensitive Q-PCR assays to determine that for both the highly attenuated N4CT9-Gag1 and prototypic Gag5 viruses, infection was limited to the inoculation site and draining lymphoid organs following IM inoculation, while more widespread infection was detected when viruses were inoculated via the IN or IV route.",

Both the attenuated and prototypic viruses showed minimal dissemination following IM inoculation, supporting the selection of this route for future first-in-man clinical trials with rVSV vectors. In addition, the attenuated rVSV did not exhibit any adverse clinical signs such as weight loss, paralysis or death despite its widespread tissue distribution in the IV and IN studies. Consistent with its attenuated phenotype in vitro, the N4CT9-Gag1 virus did not replicate as vigorously in vivo as the prototypic Gag5 virus, which was underscored by the statistical significance of the reduced viral loads in the majority of tissues for the N4CT9-Gag1 groups as compared to the Gag5 groups at the majority of time points.",

This robust immunogenicity associated with the use of the attenuated vector may be due to enhanced expression of the Gag gene by nature of its promoter-proximal position within the modified genome (Gag1), as compared to the prototypic vector, in which the Gag gene is more distal to the genomic promoter (Gag5). Indeed, this notion is supported in these studies by comparing the Gag mRNA levels to the gRNA levels between the two vectors. For all three routes of inoculation, the gRNA levels of the attenuated vec-tor were significantly lower than the corresponding gRNA levels of the prototypic vector in more tissues and at more time points than was observed for the corresponding Gag mRNA levels (compare the number of statistically significant differences in panels D and F in Figs. 1-3) .",

In the bovine study, viral spread was limited to the inoculation site and draining lymph nodes in a similar manner to what was seen with IM inoculation in mice in this study. This limited spread in cattle by an experimental model of natural infection may explain why cattle naturally infected with VSV do not develop neurological disease. Similarly, wt VSV NJ demonstrated restricted ability to spread to neuronal tissue following intradermal inoculation of adult deer mice; this restriction was absent from juvenile deer mice, however [14] . In the murine studies described herein, neither the attenuated virus nor the more virulent prototypic virus yielded adverse neurological findings or evidence of neuroinvasion after IM inoculation. Sabin and Olitsky proposed that there are natural barriers to the spread of VSV in adult mice that keep VSV from entering neuronal tissue following IM inoculation [41] , an idea supported by the present studies.",

Juvenile mice succumb to a lethal encephalitis following transmission of VSV from the olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulb via the olfactory nerve [14, [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] . The results reported herein demonstrated that IN inoculation with the more virulent prototypic virus induced more weight loss and clinical signs of disease than was observed during systemic infection following IV inoculation. Following IN inoculation, Gag5 viral loads peaked at day 2 in brain. Since whole brain homogenates were used for virus analysis in this study, it is possible that the infectious virus or viral RNA may have been concentrated in the olfactory bulb region of the brain. The peak virus titer of \u223c10 6 PFU/10 mg of tissue seen in brain homogenates of animals receiving prototypic rVSV by the IN route was >10 5 times higher than the IC LD 50 , yet the mice showed limited morbidity and minimal neuropathology. It is possible that more severe neuropathology occurred in the subset of mice that died following IN inoculation with the prototypic vector, but we were unable to assess their brains for viral loads or histopathology. In contrast, mice receiving attenuated rVSV intranasally exhibited significantly lower levels of infectious virus in brain and exhibited no signs of morbidity or mortality. Furthermore, there was less systemic spread of virus following IN instillation of the attenuated virus as well as no detectable viremia. These findings with N4CT9-Gag1 are in agreement with analysis of related attenuated VSV vectors that showed that compared to the wt vector, a truncated cytoplasmic tail VSV vector (rVSV-CT1) spread significantly less to the lymph nodes and other organs when inoculated by the IN route [50] .",

            "text": "A few previous studies have addressed persistence of VSV following infection in cattle, its natural host [51] and in experimental rodent models [50] [51] [52] [53] . In order to understand the nature of VSV persistence in animals following infection and convalescence, Letchworth and colleagues experimentally infected hamsters and cattle with VSV NJ serotype [51, 52] . While viral genomic RNA determined by specific RT-PCR persisted in brain, liver, spleen, kidney, and lung tissues of animals for several months following infection, no infectious virus was recovered from these tissues. In the studies described herein, the highly sensitive Q-PCR assays for viral RNA detected the presence of viral gRNA as well as of mRNA from both viruses in animal tissues long after clearance of infectious viruses. Among the tissues, lymph nodes were the major sites of persistence of VSV genomes, especially following IN inoculation. A recent study in mice showed that compared to the wt vector, attenuated (rVSV-CT1) or single-cycle VSV (rVSV G) vectors spread and persisted significantly less following IN inoculation, and this reduced spread and persistence correlated with a reduction in immune responses by this route [50] . Nonetheless, these vectors showed persistence of genomic RNA in lymph nodes after clearance of infectious virus. To explain the persistence of viral gRNA in lymph nodes, Rose and coworkers [50] suggested two possible models: low level long-term viral replication, or the persistence of RNA contained within nucleocapsids that are cleared slowly. In addition, a recent study reported persistence of VSV encoded antigen in lymph nodes 6 weeks after IN inoculation [53] , and the authors suggested that persistent nucleocapsids were undergoing low levels of transcription and translation, resulting in antigen expression. Our data support the model of persistent nucleocapsids that may undergo low levels of transcription, because we were able to detect gRNA, and in some cases Gag mRNA, in tissues, particularly lymph nodes, long after infectious virus had disappeared.",

Furthermore, the localized dissemination of this virus delivered intramuscularly would suggest IM as the preferred route of administration for first-in-man evaluation. These findings will aid in the development and clinical evaluation of attenuated VSV vectors and suggest a possible mechanism for the enhanced immunogenicity [34] of attenuated rVSV vectors.",
