According to the relational theory of public relations, public relations is \"the management function that establishes and maintains mutually beneficial relationships between an organization and the publics on whom its success or failure depends on\" (Cutlip, Center, & Broom, 1994, p. 2) . As media practitioners are a unique group within the public (Shin, 2006) , the relational perspective also applies to the interaction between journalists and sources such as government officials. There are many definitions of the organizational-public relationship (see Berko, Rosenfeld, & Samovar, 1997; Broom, Casey, & Ritchey, 2000; Hung, 2005; Ledingham & Bruning, 1998) , and all feature interaction, interdependence and mutual influence as key components (Ki, 2006) . These three components capture the essence of the symbiotic relationship between journalists and government officials/sources; reporters and government sources cannot survive without each other.",

In the context of a generic organizational-public relationship, positive relationship cultivation strategies are empirically tested to have a positive influence on relationship quality outcome variables (e.g., Ki, 2006; Waters, 2007) . In public relations scholarship, the relationship cultivation strategies consist of six dimensions and were initially derived from interpersonal communication research. These strategies are mutually beneficial and meant to create symmetric organizational-public relationships (Hon & Grunig, 1999) . The dimensions are access, positivity, openness, 2 sharing of tasks, social networks and assurance (Hon & Grunig, 1999; Ki, 2006) . Although these strategies apply to both organizations and the public, this study focuses solely on the actions of organizations (i.e., the Chinese government officials) toward the public (i.e., foreign reporters).",

Journalists always deem news conferences to be valuable opportunities to talk to high-level people in a face-to-face manner.

Media relations consultants suggest that if clients are not able to give a straightforward answer to reporters' inquiries, they should explain why there is no direct answer to the question (Howard & Mathews, 1985) . This type of explanation may help the client build a good relationship with the reporter, which may be useful in the future (Stewart, 2004) .

That is, it depends on the perceptions of reporters regarding the extent to which the Chinese government officials' tell the truth. This study is based on content analysis of the behaviors of government officials and reporters documented by news conference transcripts. Specifically, the study examined the way in which Chinese government officials responded to a reporter's question and the extent to which the official answered it from an observer's perspective. This design makes it difficult to assess the openness of the Chinese government in responding to foreign reporters' questions because openness is a psychological construct. Therefore, the researcher changed the variable name from openness to \"completeness\" because the former is not directly observable, while the latter may be.",

The Chinese government then decided to establish a spokesperson system across all levels of government sectors (China Daily, 2004) . In collaboration with journalism schools across China and renowned Chinese journalists, the Chinese government arranged training workshops for press officers regarding the principles of public relations and methods for approaching journalists. The frequency of news conferences has increased. The number of news conferences held by the Press Office of the State Council of China (POSCC) grew from 20 in 2002 to 68 in 2005 68 in (POSCC, 2005 . The strict travel restriction placed upon foreign journalists was suspended January 1, 2007, to provide journalists with better access to the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games; the Chinese offered to establish this suspension when they placed their bid for the Olympic Games. According to the new temporary regulation, journalists do not need to request permission from authorities to travel to open areas except Tibet. Although this Olympic Game-specific regulation was suspended, a new regulation that inherits the essence of the Olympic regulation came into effect on October 17, 2008. The Chinese government's rhetoric towards the foreign media changed during this period. The Chinese government frequently used words such as \"similar mutual benefits,\" \"cooperation\" and \"joint effort.\" These terms are completely different from the anti-capitalism words used in the past (Zhang, 2008) .",

This measure takes into account two factors. The first consideration is the number of ministerial level officials present at each news conference. Different officials possess differing levels of expertise. Within the same bureaucracy, different officials have different responsibilities, and sometimes a problem or issue is related to several ministries. Therefore, with more officials present at a news conference, the sources are more appropriate and more journalists' questions can likely be answered. Second, the researcher must account for the officials' levels in the political hierarchy. In general, the higher the officials' position, the closer they are to the decision-making process; thus, higher-ranking officials can potentially offer more \"authoritative\" information on an issue or a policy. Ministerial-level officials are good indicators of closeness to the decision-making process.

The logic of this operationalization is as follows. Normally, a news conference lasts a fixed period of time. An increase in the amount of time spent responding to domestic journalists' questions is equivalent to a reduction in the amount of time spent responding to foreign journalists' questions. In some cases, prior to the start of a news conference, Chinese officials give Chinese journalists small slips printed with questions that the officials wish to be asked. The Chinese officials then read their prepared responses (personal communication with a reporter who worked for a state-owned news agency, 2008; Wen, 2007) . Chinese journalists cooperate in this manner because the Chinese media were formerly run by the government; even now, most media are subject to strict regulations. A similar tactic is employed by US press officers, as well, particularly President Clinton's press secretaries Mike McCurry and Joe Lockhart (Hess, 2005) . The term \"foil\" defines the act of controlling the direction of news briefings (Hess, 2005) .

Furthermore, in four conferences, all questions were posed by foreign reporters; thus, the denominator in calculating this ratio is zero, and the ratio cannot be calculated. Such conferences denote that Chinese officials prioritized foreign reporters' needs over domestic reporters' needs.

The evidence suggests that the news conference organizers have attempted to increase the time spent for the Q&A session in each news conference.

Completeness was assessed according to the ratio of the number of a foreign journalist's questions answered by Chinese officials to the total number of questions raised by that journalist at a news conference. For example, a journalist may ask three questions, but a government official may choose only to answer two of them. Additionally, verbally responding to a question does not mean that the question is actually answered. For instance, an ideologically loaded response does not constitute a meaningful answer. \"Ideological\" means that officials' responses to journalists' questions are not substantive and do not address the journalists' concerns. A scenario that illustrates this is when a foreign journalist asks a Chinese official for his comments on a Taiwan issue and the official replies, \"Taiwan is part of China.\" Such comments contain little new information that foreign journalists can use and illustrate an actual refusal of information disclosure. This refusal will affect the journalists' assessments of the source and give the impression that the interviewee is not candid. Another example is a vague response to a pointed question. If a foreign reporter requests the exact number of criminals who commit copyright violations and the Chinese official states, \"not too many,\" no meaningful answer has been provided.",

Coding and aggregation schemes were identical to those for courtesy. Topic. Each news conference hosted by the Information Office of the State Council addresses a specific area or issue. Some conferences intended to explain the quarterly economic development statistics of China, while some focused on efforts to rescue people buried in the debris of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. Operationally, a total of 29 topics were identified, which ranged from food safety and public health to rural issues and social welfare (details can be found in Table 2 ).",

The \"topic\" variable was coded in terms of its political sensitivity. \"Sensitivity\" in this study was defined as the extent to which the topic is negative towards the image of the Chinese government. Sensitivity ranged from 1 (extremely non-sensitive) to 7 (extremely sensitive). Because this study only examined the news conference hosted by the State Council Information Office and individual ministries, political sensitivity here is only defined at the level of the central Chinese government. \"Extremely non-sensitive\" was operationally defined as a topic related to the positive image of the Chinese government, such as an issue that demonstrated the government's willingness to contribute to the welfare of other countries and international stakeholders. A topic that was \"extremely sensitive\" referred to a problem faced by the Chinese government that remained unresolved for many years and that damaged the interests of international stakeholders. The Chinese government has been notorious for concealing information regarding these sensitive issues. The researcher and a coder performed the recoding to ensure reliability. Scott's Pi is .88, which reached an acceptable level of agreement. The coder and the researcher reviewed and discussed the three topics without agreement and eventually agreed upon a single solution.",

On average, a Chinese government official spent less time answering foreign reporters' questions than Chinese journalists' inquiries. Chinese officials meaningfully answered eight out of ten foreign reporters' questions.

Different from expected, four of the seven media cultivation strategies did not vary across different levels of political sensitivity. Interestingly, the study found that foreign reporters at conferences on sensitive topics had better access to senior Chinese officials than those on less sensitive topics and that the ratio of Q&A session for conferences on sensitive topics was higher than that of conferences on least sensitive topics. Moreover, the trend of media cultivation strategies over time was not contingent upon news conference topics' political sensitivity. It should also be noted that the proportion of conferences on sensitive topics increased from 2001 to 2009. Unexpectedly, the study found that the ratio of Q&A session (access) was lower in 2007-2009 than in 2004-2006 . This difference may be attributed to the 27 news conferences on the Sichuan earthquake from May 13 to June 16, 2008.

In the context of news conferences, Chinese officials have not exhausted all possible media relationship cultivation strategies. For example, in hypothesis testing, two variables-calling foreign journalists \"friends\" (networking) and citing third-party evidence (networking)-were excluded because of their low frequency of appearance at news conferences. Thus, there is room for the Chinese government's media relations to further improve.",

In 2010 and 2011, additional ministries and organs of the Communist Party of China (CPC) began holding news conferences that are open to foreign journalists. For instance, in 2011, the organs of the CPC at central and provincial levels began to unveil their spokespersons for the first time. It will be important to assess how these party officials communicate with journalists, especially foreign reporters. However, this process is neither simple nor straightforward. For example, in the first half of 2011, the relationship between the Chinese government and foreign journalists became tense because of foreign journalists' interest in the \"Jasmine Revolution\" Rally on Beijing's Wangfujing Street, which resulted in physical conflicts with the local police. Such fluctuations in the relationship between Chinese government officials and foreign reporters remind scholars of the importance of continuous monitoring of the situation.",
