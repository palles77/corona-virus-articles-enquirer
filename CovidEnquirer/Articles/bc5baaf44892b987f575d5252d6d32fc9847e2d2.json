This paper examines air flow path and airborne pollutant distribution by computational fluid dynamics modeling and field measurement. In hospitals, the risk of virus diffusion mainly depends on air flow behavior and changes in direction caused by supply air and exhaust air locations. An improved isolation room ventilation strategy has been suggested, and is found to be the most efficient in removing contaminants based on the observations and simulation results from three ventilation systems. The results show that ventilation systems utilizing the \"lowlevel extraction\" technique are very effective at removing pollutants in the human breathing zone. A new clean isolation room ventilation strategy has been developed that employs two exhaust air grilles on the wall behind the bed at low floor level, coupled with a fan filter unit, and is found to have the highest pollutant removal efficiency.",

            "text": "Airborne transmission is one of the main spread routes for a number of infectious diseases such as smallpox, tuberculosis [1] . New diseases and outbreaks are always a threat. More than 8000 reported cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) resulted in 774 deaths and led to a wave of research and standardization of medical facilities with respect to airborne diseases. 36 patients died and 186 people were infected during the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in South Korea in May 2015 [2] . Outbreaks of such airborne diseases in hospitals elevate the risk of infection from patients to healthcare workers (HCWs) and other patients. Due mainly to contact with an infected host, also poor ventilation in hospitals, MERS viruses began to spread rapidly to patients, visitors, and even to HCWs [3] . Isolation is the primary control. Systems serving airborne infectious isolation rooms (AIIR), highly contaminated areas, should maintain a negative air pressure with respect to adjoining rooms or corridors. Because airborne transmission of pollutant has a possibility of disease spread to HCWs and patients, HVAC systems are a secondary control measure. The plan of AIIR with negative pressure includes a complex process of decisions. The specifications of mechanical ventilation system, location, layout, interior finishing, and AIIR facilities are critical to the design concepts [4] . Because of return air (RA), exhaust air (EA) and supply air (SA) locations, the risk of virus dispersal at the hospital is influenced by changes in movement and direction of air flow [5] [6] [7] .",

(Rice et al. [8] ; Bjorn and Nielsen [9] ; Huang and Tsao [10] ; Qian et al. [11] ; Rui et al. [12] , Morawska [13] , Li et al. [14] , and Yu et al. [15] used a tracer gas simulation to analyze the infection path in hospitals where the outbreak occurred, and confirmed by examining the tracer gas concentration in the space between the first infected patient and those infected afterwards that the virus had indeed spread through the air. Studies on the spread of viral pathogens and contaminants generally assume that the breathed air exhaled from patients is the source of contaminants or pathogens and their diffusion is therefore analyzed. Considering the breathed air, Hayashi et al. [16] reported that the breathing volume of an adult under normal conditions was 6 L/min based on 0.7 met of activity during sleep (convective heat transfer 33.3 W/person), and the volume of exhaled air under normal conditions was 14.4 L/min. Abraham et al. [17] used the large-eddy simulation (LES) method in an operation room (OR) and validated the model with fog flow visualization. It shows the value of such validation and the appropriate use of CFD. Shirozu et al. [18] used RANS-based turbulence models and validated by experiment. These papers showed the critical importance of validation and also the power of CFD to carry out simulations. In particular, calculations were performed without moving surgeons and staff but the experiments were performed with a moving surgical team. The results of that case were not adversely affected.",

Field measurements were conducted in an AIIR with advanced ventilation. The results of CFD numerical analysis were validated by the field measurement results. This has been done to make sure that predictions of pollutant concentrations and air flow in succeeding cases to other systems are reliable and accurate. Finally, airflow and pollutant concentration profiles with FFU were simulated and analyzed for these proposed strategies to develop an optimum design for removing pollutant from this negative pressure AIIR and provide better protection for the HCWs. This research is practice-based learning in a real hospital construction project. A series of full-scale field measurements and CFD modeling were carried out in the new AIIR of the Hospital.

AIIRs are designed the single pass approach to bring clean air from the clean zone to the contaminated zone. According to the US ASHRAE-170 standard [19] , the pressure difference required maintaining negative pressure is minimum 2.5 Pa. The actual negative pressure level will depend on several factors: differences in the SA and EA volume; air flow paths; and air flow openings and physical configuration of the wardroom. To maintain negative pressure in a wardroom, the EA volume needs to be 10% larger than the SA volume [20] .

Because dilution strategy is improper for particulate contaminants, air mixing should not be encouraged. From the SA is either appropriately conditioned air from outside of the building or recirculated air from the central AHU, the EA, contaminated air in the AIIR, is extracted to the outside via the single pass. In new construction of healthcare facilities, the air change rate of AIIR should be at least 12 ACH [19, 21, 22] . The problem of AIIR ventilation systems can be identified, such as air mixing and inappropriate directional air flow pattern. Ideally, the clean SA should be introduced near HCWs and then, EA should be removed near the patients [23] . The typical AIIR ventilation strategy employs a ceiling SA and ceiling EA system and/or optional air recirculation unit with HEPA filter such as FFU. As shown in Fig. 2 (a), this ventilation strategy may not efficiently reduce the pollutant concentrations of an infectious source at specific locations due to air mixing in the AIIR. In short, SA is in flowed near staff, but EA is not captured near patient. There will be an expected high risk of infection from patients to HCWs caused by air mixing in an AIIR. An improved ventilation system in Fig. 2 (b) as the best arrangement is to EA grilles on the wall near the floor at the head of the bed, and to SA diffusers at the ceiling above the foot of the bed. The bottom of the EA grilles should be located about 150 mm above the floor. This ventilation strategy has been adopted in some hospitals, but the area in front of the EA grilles is often not kept clear of obstructions such as supply carts and furniture. Because the location of the SA and EA is very important, two wall-mounted EA grilles coupling with FFU was developed for effective removal of airborne contamination. (Fig. 3 study is to find an improved ventilation system based on contaminant concentrations which are the modeled and measured parameter and best design practices should be followed.",

The renormalization group k-\u03b5 was selected as the turbulence model with multi-component gas fluid (Air/SF 6 ), while SIMPLE was used as the pressure-velocity coupling algorithm. 550,000 grid cells were arrayed across the simulation domain.",

In the case of solid particles, such as dust or microbes, the analysis is possible in the network model because it has a pollution source model for solids, but the analyses in the CFD model handles the solid particle diffusion indirectly by setting gases such as CO 2 , N 2 O, or SF 6 as the tracer gas and inputting their gaseous physical properties. The unique properties of SF 6 have led to its adoption for a number of industrial and scientific applications including tracer gas for studying airflow in ventilation systems. Researches on the diffusion of such pathogens as viruses or pollution sources generally assume discharged air from breathing to be the source of the pollution or pathogen and then analyze its diffusion. We first obtained the steady state solutions for the air flow field, and then tracer gas was continuously released into the AIIR through the source manikin's mouth in bed at a mass fraction of 0.04 [24] , with an upward exhalation velocity of 0.955 m/s.

Compared with Ventilation Case#1, Ventilation Case#2 and Case#3 have lower concentration values, ranging between 25.1 and 34.4 ppm, and between 21.2 and 24.4 ppm, respectively. Table 5 shows the percentage difference of predicted concentration between the ventilation Case#1, Case#2 and Case#3. When the HCWs were treating the patient, there was a large difference in the pollutant exposure level. At 1.4 m location average value of pollutant concentration, Case#2 was 11.9% lower than in Case#1. Similarly, Case#3 was more effective in removing contaminant in the AIIR compared to Case#1 and Case#2 with 24.2% and 14.0% respectively. For the average concentration of whole room, Case#2 was lower than Case#1 with 22.7%. Exposure level of Case#3, 34.8 ppm, was lower compared to Case#1 (48.4 ppm) and Case#2 (37.4 ppm). Ventilation case #3, which was the best of three cases to remove pollutant from AIIR, bound to improve efficiency with 28.1% of Case#1 and 7.0% of Case#2. A clean air moves from the HCWs to the patient resulted in the improved air flow pattern in healthcare facilities. The use of a single pass setup is expected to lower the risk of infection from patients to HCWs These results indicated that placement of EA grilles directly behind the patient's head can potentially provide a ready flow path for airborne contamination to exit the AIIR without remarkable recirculation and entrainment back into the SA stream. A combination of locations for and types of SA diffusers, locations of room EA and SA flow rates can affect the air flow patterns in the AIIR which are quite complex and specific to a particular design configuration.

In the modeling of contaminant's migration patterns under steady-state condition, besides specifying the flow conditions across the boundaries, the neighboring rooms' conditions of the source term within the continuum and its boundaries must be defined. [27] Boundary conditions were about the same for the ventilation Case#3 except total heat load and SA temperature. These analyses were carried out for partial load conditions which are more prevailing than the peak design load conditions. Because field measurement was carried out at night and there was almost no difference between indoor and OA temperature, the windows and exterior walls of the room were assumed to be adiabatic. The total sensible heat load was assumed to be 11.95 W/m 2 in consideration of artificial lighting only. The OA, with a total air exchange rate of 12 ACH, was supplied to the room at 24.6\u00b0C. The release source was simulated at 1.09 L/min, as a point discharging SF 6 . Fig. 8(a) shows the horizontal concentration distribution pattern of 1.4 m from the floor representing the HCWs' respiration level when attending to the patient. The dispersion of contaminants is not symmetrical, which is influenced by the indoor air flow pattern. As shown in Fig. 8(b) , around the patient's breathing level at 0.9 m from the floor, it is clear that the highest pollutant concentration is found. The concentration of SF 6 is lower as they move away from the patient. Fig. 8(c) illustrates the predicted air flow pattern of a vertical section of the AIIR. The air flows towards the patient and is discharged via two EA grilles mounted on the wall and one ceiling EA grille in the room. The patient on the bed is experiencing about 0.10 m/s air flow. This velocity is the recommended value of less than 0.25 m/s. [28] As shown in Table 6 , the measured concentration is correlates well with the predicted concentration at SP-1, SP-2 and SP-3 that are the breathing level of the HCW. The percentage difference between the simulation and measurement results ranged between -9.7 and 7.0. As shown in Fig. 9 , the measured concentration of pollutant at SP-1 to SP-3 did not much change with a deviation of 4.3 ppm (Q1-Q3) during the experiment. This model is reasonably accurate to evaluate the profile of pollutant in the AIIR. Since the simulation results give concentration ranges similar to those of the measurements, we consider the simulation method to be primarily validated. Therefore, we used the same simulation method to carry out additional analysis. In the validation work, it should be noted that the multi-component gas type and emission rate of the source is 1.09 L/min. Before validation of the prediction results against the measurement results, the model was already modified representing the ventilation cases.",

Most common bacteria are removed by the 0.3-micron pore size HEPA filters, rated 99.997% efficient at retaining particles. Fig. 11(a) shows the concentration distribution pattern of horizontal planes at 1.4 m and 0.9 m from the floor level to represent the breathing level of the HCWs while treating the patient. The high concentration found near the patient is clearly visible. However, the pollutant's concentration was not diluted and the stagnation of air was not observed in the AIIR. It was found that airborne contamination seemed to be perfectly removed by FFU. The greater flow rate of supply air already filtered by the FFU should pass over the patient and return directly to the exhaust grille in a single pass without entraining back into the supply airstream, which will ensure that it does not mix with the room air. The dispersion of pollutant is very efficiently removed, and this is influenced by directional airflow patterns of the FFU system in the room. As shown in Fig. 11(b) , the predicted airflow profile of horizontal planes, the supply air was introduced near the HCWs, and the exhaust air was directly collected near patients. It shows the predicted airflow profile of a vertical plane along the length of the room. It is observed from the air velocity vector plot that there is no short-circuiting of air between the air diffuser and the exhaust grille. Table 8 shows the pollutant's exposure level of the HCWs. Ventilation Case #3 with FFU has very low concentration values ranging between 2.0 and 8.9 ppm. The percentage difference between Case #3 and Case #3 with FFU ranged between \u221258.0 and \u221290.6. At 1.4 m location average value of pollutant concentration, Case #3 with FFU was 85.2% lower compared to Case #3. For the average concentration of the whole room, Case #3 with FFU was much lower than the 79.6% in Case #3. This advanced ventilation strategy increased removal efficiency of airborne contamination remarkably. Advanced baffling technology ensures uniform airflow across the filter face and attenuates sound. Designers can select between HEPA filters, rated 99.97% efficient at removing particles \u22650.3 microns, or ULPA filters, rated 99.997% efficient at removing particles \u22650.12 microns. This ventilation system will provide year-round, 24/7 operation, depending on AIIR clean air quality. ",

This study has conducted to increase the understanding of the improved ventilation system, including both numerical simulation and full-scale experimental work. It demonstrates that the air flow paths, induced SA flow paths, and EA grille placement can be coordinated to establish effective contaminant control. Locations of the SA and EA openings are the most important elements that directly affect the pollutants dispersion in the room. Thus a careful evaluation of the HVAC configuration can help in gaining the insight and optimizing the flow path of air to obtain the desired combination of occupant thermal comfort and the best possible hygienic conditions in the AIIR. A combination of locations and EA/SA diffuser types, locations of the room RA, and EA/SA flow rates can affect the air flow patterns in the AIIR, which are very complex and specific to a particular design configuration.
