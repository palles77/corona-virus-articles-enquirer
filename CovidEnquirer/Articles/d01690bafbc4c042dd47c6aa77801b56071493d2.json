The total frequency of ORVs was 2.6% (45/1,734) during the 2007-08 season and 99.7% (1,477/1,482) during the 2008-09 season, indicating a marked increase in ORVs in Japan during 1 infl uenza season. The NA gene of ORVs in the 2007-08 season fell into 2 distinct lineages by D354G substitution, whereas that of ORVs in the 2008-09 season fell into 1 lineage. NA inhibition assay and M2 sequencing showed that almost all the ORVs were sensitive to zanamivir and amantadine. The hemagglutination inhibition test showed that ORVs were antigenetically similar to the 2008-09 vaccine strain A/Brisbane/59/2007. Our data indicate that the current vaccine or zanamivir and amantadine are effective against recent ORVs, but continuous surveillance remains necessary.",

Vaccination is the primary method for prevention; antiviral drugs are used mainly for prophylaxis and therapy. Currently, 2 classes of drugs, matrix 2 (M2) blockers and neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) are available, but M2 blockers such as amantadine and rimantadine are not commonly used because of the rapid generation of resistance and lack of effi cacy against infl uenza B virus (2) (3) (4) . The NAIs zanamivir and oseltamivir are widely used because of effects against infl uenza A and B viruses and a low frequency of resistance. NAI virus surveillance studies by several groups have demonstrated that <1% of viruses tested show naturally occurring resistance to oseltamivir as of 2007 (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) , indicating limited human-to-human transmission of these viruses.",

These viruses showed a specifi c NA mutation with a histidine-to-tyrosine substitution at the aa 275 position (N1 numbering, H275Y), conferring highlevel resistance to oseltamivir. Most of these ORVs were isolated from NAI-untreated patients and retained similar ability of human-to-human transmission to oseltamivirsensitive infl uenza viruses A (H1N1) (OSVs) (10, 15) . In response to public health concerns about ORVs, the World Health Organization (WHO) directed Global Infl uenza Surveillance Network laboratories to intensify NAI surveillance and announced regularly updated summaries of ORV data collected from each laboratory on its website (16) . This site reported that the global frequency increased from 16% (October 2007-March 2008) to 44% (April 2008-September 2008) to 95% (October 2008-January 2009), indicating that ORVs have spread rapidly around the world. Japan has the highest annual level of oseltamivir usage per capita in the world, comprising >70% of world consumption (10) . Such high use of oseltamivir has raised concerns about emergence of OSVs with increased resistance to this drug. Moreover, in Japan, 2 recent infl uenza seasons were dominated by infl uenza viruses A (H1N1) (Figure 1 ). If a high prevalence of ORVs is observed, primary selection of oseltamivir treatment for infl uenza patients should be reconsidered. Thus, monitoring ORVs is a serious public health issue.",

In the 2007-08 season, 45 viruses possessing H275Y mutation (total frequency of ORVs 2.6%; Figure  2 , panel A) were observed in 10 prefectures, indicating that the frequency of ORVs was signifi cantly lower than that in countries in Europe and the United States (8, (11) (12) (13) (14) . In Tottori prefecture, however, 22 of 68 infl uenza viruses A (H1N1) tested possessed H275Y, showing a markedly higher frequency (32.4%) than that in other prefectures. In the 2008-09 season, however, ORVs were observed nationwide. Of 1,482 infl uenza viruses A (H1N1), 1,477 viruses possessed a H275Y mutation, for a total frequency of 99.7% ( Figure 2, , and the other ORVs are also genetically close to OSVs from Japan (online Appendix Figure) . These HA genes were also genetically identical or close together (online Appendix Figure) , suggesting that almost all ORVs from Japan with the Hawaii lineage are derived from OSVs from Japan. On the other hand, in the Northern-Eu lineage, OSV counterparts were not observed, but foreign ORVs genetically close to ORVs from Japan were observed. During the 2007-08 season, the NA gene of ORVs from Japan was close to that of ORVs isolated from countries in Europe (i.e., A/Paris/0341/2007 and A/ England/26/2008). During the 2008-09 season, the ORVs from Japan, which shared A189T on HA protein, were further divided into 4 subclades (C-1 to C-4) by common amino acid changes on HA and/or NA (online Appendix Figure) . ORVs from Japan in C-2 and C-3 were genetically close to the ORVs isolated from North America or Hawaii (e.g., A/Memphis/03/2008 and A/Hawaii/19/2008), whereas ORVs in C-1, representing most infl uenza A (H1N1) viruses from the 2008-09 season in Japan, and ORVs in C-4 were close to ORVs isolated from South Africa and Australia in the Southern Hemisphere (e.g., A/ Kenya/1432/2008 and A/Victoria/501/2008). All ORVs except C-3 were isolated before the emergence of ORVs from Japan in each subclade.

Because this use could cause effi cient selection of ORVs in individual patients, Japan might be the initial site of worldwide spread of ORVs. However, long-term NAI surveillance in Japan during 1996-2007 and recent surveillance showed a low frequency of NAI-resistant viruses for any strains and subtypes (10, 21, 22) , suggesting that transmissibility of ORVs selected by drug pressure was remarkably decreased. In addition, previous NAI surveillance (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) and several animal studies (23) (24) (25) (26) also suggested that NAI-resistant viruses would become defective viruses with attenuated infectivity and transmissibility to human. In contrast, despite little NAI use, a high emergence of ORVs has been detected in several countries in Europe since November 2007. These ORVs had as effi cient transmissibility as OSVs in humanto-human transmission, resulting in worldwide spread in a short period of time. Although whether the initial ORV detected in Norway in the 2007-08 season appeared because of NAI drug pressure is unknown, those ORVs may have obtained amino acid changes on NA and/or other proteins to compensate for the defect, in addition to the H275Y substitution on the NA protein. Most ORVs belong genetically to the Northern-Eu lineage in clade 2B, suggesting that the gene constellation may contain a big advantage to retain infectivity and transmissibility.",

In the Hawaii lineage, almost all ORVs in Japan would be derived from OSVs in Japan because the NA gene of ORVs was similar to OSV counterparts isolated at similar times or from similar regions (online Appendix Figure) . On the other hand, in the Northern-Eu lineage, ORVs in Japan would have been introduced from other countries. In 2007-08, almost all ORVs would be imported from countries in Europe. In 2008-09, the ORVs in C-1, which comprised most isolates in 2008-09, and ORVs in C-4 were genetically similar to ORVs isolated from the Southern Hemisphere. Because infl uenza activity in the Southern Hemisphere occurs half a year earlier than that in the Northern Hemisphere, most ORVs in Japan conceivably could have been imported from the Southern Hemisphere. ORVs in C-2 and C-3 were genetically similar to ORVs isolated in North America and Hawaii, but the collection month of ORVs in C-3 were similar to each other, suggesting that ORVs in C-3 might be derived from an unknown common origin ORV. The ORVs obtained during 2008-09 were not genetically similar to any ORVs isolated in Tot-tori during 2007-08, indicating that ORVs from Tottori had been eliminated and had not formed the origin ORVs for the 2008-09 season in Japan. As for A/Yokohama/91/2007 belonging to clade 2C, the patient from which this virus was isolated was known to have taken oseltamivir before sampling (22) , indicating that selective drug pressure in this person might have selected for this ORV.",

NA sequencing of these viruses showed 2 types of amino acid changes. One virus, A/Tottori/16/2008 (OSV), possessed a Q136K substitution, which reportedly confers resistance to zanamivir (27, 28) . Conversely, most of the other viruses possessed D151 G/V/N. The amino acid changes D151 to N or E among subtype H1N1 viruses and to A, G, E, N, or V among H3N2 have been reported (7, 8, 19) , and viruses with D151 substitutions often exhibit reduced sensitivity to NAIs (8, 19, 29) . However, a recent study reported a possible role for cell culture in selecting these D151 variant viruses (19) . In the present study, D151 variations (D151G/E/N) also were not detected from available original clinical specimens (Table 1) , supporting the previous fi nding. We thus concluded that viruses with D151 variations would not have emerged naturally, and all ORVs would remain sensitive to zanamivir.",

To further investigate D151 variants, available original clinical specimens of viruses with D151 variation were subjected to NA sequencing, so that all D151 variations (D151G/E/N) were not detected in the original clinical specimens (Table 1). We thus concluded that D151 variants might not have emerged as a natural occurrence and all recent ORVs would retain sensitivity to zanamivir. Susceptibility to M2 inhibitors was determined to fi nd established-resistant markers by M2-sequencing. The 367 viruses (288 isolates in the 2007-08 season; 79 isolates in the 2008-09 season) including 123 ORVs (45 and 78, respectively) and 244 OSVs (243 and 1, respectively) were tested. Viruses belonging to clade 2B were sensitive to M2 inhibitors, and viruses belonging to clade 2C were resistant to M2 inhibitors, so all ORVs except A/Yokohama/91/2007 were sensitive to M2 inhibitors. A/Yokohama/91/2007 belonged to clade 2C and was the only virus resistant to both oseltamivir and M2 inhibitors. To estimate the reactivity of ORVs and OSVs to ferret antiserum against 2008-09 vaccine strain A/ Brisbane/59/2009, the HI test was performed. Good inhibition was achieved in 76% of OSVs and 69% of ORVs by A/Brisbane/59/2009 ferret antiserum, and 22% of OSVs and 28% of ORVs showed a 4-fold reduction in HI titer to the homologous titer, respectively (Table 2). Only 2% and 3% of OSVs and ORVs showed a >8-fold reduction in HI titer to A/Brisbane/59/2009 ferret antiserum. These data demonstrated that OSVs and ORVs were anitigenitically indistinguishable from each other and were similar to the 2008-09 vaccine strain A/Brisbane/59/2009.",
