In its general sense, governance refers to all patterns of power, authority and rule that can secure order, and it is relevant to situations where there is a hierarchical state, where the state depends on others, or where the state plays little or no role (Bramwell, 2011) . The governance literature suggests that neo-liberalism and other changing circumstances have meant that the state in recent years often has a diminishing capacity to directly lead in public policies. To achieve collective goals more effectively, governments have had to work with a much wider network of agencies so as to benefit from their strengths and to access resources (Healey, 2003) . Yet a debate remains about the extent to which such developments in governance have affected the state's steering capacity. Some suggest that the state has weakened, but others consider that nonhierarchical governance is often embedded in hierarchical structures, and that government can be effective at steering these networks. Thus, governments can remain a central actor, especially in terms of legitimacy and accountability (Bramwell & Lane, 2010 Lange, Driessen, Sauer, Bornmann, & Burger, 2013) .",

It also provides sets of rules in governing arrangements which affect who gets what, where, when, and how in society (Howlett, Rayner, & Tollefson, 2009 ). The power distribution in a governance mode is a socio-political construction embedded in a political economy, which depends on the actors' socio-economic positions, interests, and values, and how actors' interests and preferences are contested, negotiated and grafted together (Beaumont & Dredge, 2010) . Any changes in the political economy might alter the actors' influence, values and aspirations and the negotiation processes. The mode of governance will reflect the shifting patterns of perceptions, beliefs and relations among actors in society, as well as the demands of securing capital accumulation and retaining the legitimacy and authority of the governance arrangements (Pierre & Peters, 2005) .",

A few studies have examined the character of tourism governance in specific places, including the character of the governing relations, governing logic, key decision makers and political objectives (Beaumont & Dredge, 2010; Erku\u015f -\u20ac Ozt\u00fcrk, 2011; Hall, 2011) . A very small number of studies of tourism governance in destinations use typologies of simplified \"ideal typical\" modes of governance from the political science literature. In these typologies each mode displays its own typical governance characteristics with regard to such features as the participants, objectives, instruments, and outcomes (DiGaetano & Strom, 2003) . These typologies can be valuable in identifying differing potential approaches to tourism governance found in destinations. The present paper adds new understanding in this field by exploring in a more sustained way than in previous research the modes of general and tourism governance in a tourist destination.",

In the real world, one should not be surprised to find tourism governance in one place resembling more than one \"ideal type\" mode, so there can be \"hybrid\" forms of governance (Treib, B\u20ac ahr, & Falkner, 2005) . Thus, the evaluation here adds new insights by exploring whether tourism governance in a specific destination resembles specific \"ideal type\" modes or is more of a hybrid, and also by considering the relationships between the constituent elements of the destination's governance mode, including between the overall governance and the governance of tourism development.",

This is because \"ideal types\" of governance modes from the political science literature are primarily analytic rather than causal and predictive (Harding & Blokland, 2014) . Thus, the present study evaluates tourism governance using a political economy approach as a broad theoretical perspective that suggests causal processes of temporal continuity and change. Thus, the paper adds new understandings in this field by combining analysis at two levels of abstraction: a more specific level of conceptual analysis of modes of governance, together with a more general level of theoretical analysis using a political economy perspective. This means that stability and change in the modes of overall governance and tourism planning governance in a destination are related to trends in the local political economy.",

Collaboration among these actors, therefore, is usually important for governments to achieve their collective goals. Thus, governance is generally seen as involving governmental and non-governmental actors working together collectively, perhaps so as to secure a collective goal or social order (Bramwell & Lane, 2011; Rhodes, 1996) .

Political economy as a broad perspective has been widely applied in the social sciences, but it is only occasionally applied to tourism (Bramwell, 2011) . It assists in understanding how economic and political conditions help shape power relationships among actors (Jessop, 2008) and how government operates within society (Bramwell, 2011; Jessop, 2008; Pierre, 1999) . In this perspective governments are considered to help to regulate society in order to mitigate various economic and social crises and to promote the system's resilience (Bevir, 2009) . Such regulation is important as Marx argues that market forces are inherently unstable and lead to capital over-accumulation and unstable social relations (Wang & Bramwell, 2012) . Stability in capitalist economic systems is also considered to depend on securing economic returns on capital and on establishing the societal conditions to further this end. Governments also need to maintain political legitimacy in the context of unstable social relations. Without that legitimacy governments can fail to retain the authority required to regulate the economy and maintain social order. Concerns about legitimacy may encourage governments to respond to popular pressures, pursue welfare policies, or to form alliances or partnerships with some social groups. In such ways, therefore, the economic and political conditions can substantially influence the government's activities and policies, although such conditions are not determinant because of the vital importance of the agency of actors and the contingency of particular circumstances (Bramwell, 2011) .",

First, Wang and Bramwell (2012) note that local government in Hangzhou, China had a strong entrepreneurial and pro-growth policy agenda in order to secure competitive advantage, such as by creating a strong business environment and by attracting inward investment, and to safeguard its political legitimacy and authority. In that context, decision-making for the city's strategy for the heritage and tourism district of West Lake was restricted to a few powerful \"policy community\" actors who at times put more emphasis on economic development than on heritage protection. Second, Sharpley's (2008) assessment of tourism planning in Dubai suggests that the country's huge oil revenues gave the government considerable political and economic legitimacy to steer policies in support of its pro-growth interests. Yet, the government also collaborated with the private sector in order to embrace environmental objectives, to achieve quality in the tourism sector, to boost tourism skills and employment opportunities for local people, and to encourage local women to take up tourism managerial positions in an Islamic state, all of which enhances Dubai's economic competitiveness and quality of life. A hybrid governance mode involving state control and publiceprivate partnerships was considered effective for Dubai's tourism development so that capital accumulation and the government's legitimacy were safeguarded.",

She shows that, compared with Hong Kong, Macao's tourism governance was more centralized, with decisions made by just a few senior government officials. Macao's government appears to have more political and economic legitimacy behind its tourism polices and planning, with this affected by the slower development of its active civil society, the generally lower education levels, and the casino industry's substantial contributions to government revenues. Lange et al. (2013) suggest that it is helpful to see the modes of governance in specific places as involving interdependent relationships between three dimensions: politics, polity and policy (see Fig. 1 ). First, the politics dimension of governance involves \"the actors and interaction processes inherent in a mode of governance\" (Lange et al., 2013, p. 409) . DiGaetano and Klemanski (1999, p. 8) identify the politics dimension with the \"composition of key participants\" and the \"governing alignment\", as well as with who has most influence and power in public policymaking, the procedures through which actors interact in networks, and how the actions of players influence the network's direction.",

The data were drawn from archival materials, newspapers, government documents on planning laws, procedures and policies, as well as government planning studies, reports and statistics. Academic articles on Hong Kong's urban and tourism practices were also studied.",

The contribution of exports to the city's GDP increased from 54% in the 1960s to 64% in the 1970s (Schenk, 2008) . The boom in commercial and manufacturing activities also promoted a surge in demand for retail and office spaces and a real estate boom.

The interaction rules involved incorporating the business elites into the major policymaking bodies, which led to an elite consensus politics (Hughes, 1976) . The Hong Kong government played a key role, as it was a major partner in these cooperative and collaborative arrangements. At that time, Hong Kong people generally accepted this pro-growth governance mode because most were migrants from Mainland China who largely put meeting their immediate material needs above that of challenging government (Hughes, 1976) .",

The newly vigorous engagement of China in international trade and investment after the Open Door Policy, and the signal in 1984 of Hong Kong's future integration with Mainland China, encouraged Hong Kong to provide commercial and financial services support for China's economic development. But Hong Kong's growing economic integration with China in this period encouraged manufacturing firms to relocate to China to take advantage of cheaper labor. In part due to this, in the 1980s Hong Kong's economy substantially shifted from manufacturing to financial services, retailing and tourism. Service sector employment grew from 52% to 80% from 1981 to 2000, while in the same period manufacturing employment fell from 39% to 10% (Schenk, 2008) . This period also saw the rise of several powerful local business people, such as those heading Cheung Kong Company and Sun Hung Kai Company (Scott, 1989) , as well as a boom in the tourism sector (Law & Cheung, 1998; Mok & Dewald, 1999) . Facilitated by the completion of several tourism-related megafacilities, such as the Cross Harbor Tunnel and Mass Transit Railway, the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, the Hong Kong Ocean Park and several hotel projects which offered a total of 33,536 hotel rooms in 1996 (Mok & Dewald, 1999) , tourist numbers increased very substantially from 505,733 in 1966 to 10,406,261 in 1997 (Law & Cheung, 1998) . The city was being described as \"a show window of capitalism in the East\" (Law & Cheung, 1998: 42) . Many tourists wanted to experience Hong Kong while it was still under colonial rule (Mok & Dewald, 1999) . In the 1990s Hong Kong was ranked as Asia's most popular tourist destination (Law & Cheung, 1998) .",

Second, pressure to improve communication with civil society encouraged local District Boards to be set up in the 1980s, with these consisting of both popularly elected and appointed councilors, and they sowed seeds for a growth in Hong Kong's political groups and parties (Scott, 1989) . Third, the introduction of elected members to the Legislative Council in the early 1990s allowed Hong Kong residents to have more influence on this higher tier of governance (Cheung, 2005) . Fourth, a growth in political groups and parties, the expanding employment and salaries in service sector white collar jobs (the product of Hong Kong's economic restructuring), and improving education, had nurtured a group of wealthier and better educated Hong Kong residents who actively sought greater democracy and improved environmental conditions, especially as people increasingly realized that past economic success and economic restructuring had brought many social and environmental problems. The problems included poor air quality (partly caused by the wider region's rapid economic development), the influx of migrants from China, and a surplus of industrial land (Chiu, 2003; Yeh, 1997) .",

The pro-growth mode was underpinned by the focus of the government and business sector on promoting capital accumulation through financial services, real estate and tourism, and on assisting with Hong Kong's economic restructuring. The prevailing interaction rules involved the dominant actors working together to adapt to the changing circumstances so as to secure their interests. The dominant actors were senior government officials and the business elites, but government had the central role as it established the governance arrangements. Yet pluralist elements were also emerging in this period due to civil society demands for wider involvement. Thus, a hybrid governance mode had begun to develop which involved pro-growth and pluralist features. The interaction rules in this hybrid mode included more policy deliberation and bargaining between the increasingly diverse groups and the government as they competed to set the city's policy agenda (DiGaetano & Strom, 2003) . Hong Kong's government understood that it had to start to listen more to the public and to mediate between the public, business and government interests. The government thus had an increasingly complex metagovernance task in \"striking a balance\" between the different actors, interests, steering mechanisms and governance modes.",

Hong Kong's Chief Executive (under British rule, the Governor) and the Executive and Legislative Councils continued to dominate public policymaking. Executive Council members were directly appointed by the Chief Executive and they were pro-government and pro-Beijing elites, while Legislative Council members were directly elected by local people, but with industry and professional groups forming a different functional constituency. Cheng (2012) suggests that in 2012 as many as 43 of the 70 Legislative Council members were pro-Beijing and only 27 were pro-democracy. Of the 30 seats from the functional constituency, 18 represented the interests of traditional business and professional elites. This incorporation of business people, professional groups and pro-Beijing figures onto Hong Kong's two important advisory bodies has allowed the government substantially to maintain the former elite consensus politics and to safeguard its pro-growth interests (Cheung, 2005) .",

The failure of several of the first Chief Executive's bold initiatives upset many people, as did the generally top-down, paternalistic policymaking (Cheung, 2005) . More people became willing to engage in collective action to protest for a more livable and sustainable city. This applied for the CentraleWanchai Reclamation Plan, with tourism-related dimensions including a station for the Airport Express, extension to the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, new Star Ferry terminal and new open spaces. Nearly 100 objections to the Plan were received in 1994, arguing that the scale of the associated harbor reclamation was too large, unnecessary and not environmentally sound. Community reactions were even stronger following the 1998 launch of the Southeast Kowloon Development Scheme, a large-scale residential and commercial project with some tourism-related aspects, such as a cruise terminal, on the site of the relocated international airport. Nearly 900 objections were received from the public (Wan & Chiu, 2008) , and professional bodies produced alternative plans to urge the government to alter the scheme, and the final Plan had a 59% reduction in the scale of harbor reclamation (Wan & Chiu, 2008) . Further, the government's proposed National Security Bill in 2002 triggered a street protest in 2003 by around half a million people, often middle class and professional, to highlight concerns that the proposal threatened freedoms of speech and association. Since then, petitions and protests have often been used by civil society to exert pressure on government policies (Chan & Lee, 2007; Wan, 2013) . And very recently it was possible to suggest that for a time Hong Kong has \"literally become a city of protest\" (Chan & Lee, 2007; Wan, 2013, p. 169) .",

The district level planning translates the sub-regional strategies into district Outline Zoning Plans, and these are exhibited for public comment.

Ng (2008, p. 170) argues that behind the idea that the \"market leads and government facilitates is a government with substantial discretionary power vested in law to manipulate the strategic growth directions of the city\". This is because \"the legal system has legitimized a set of planning and development processes that deny citizens a right to participate and confine decision-making power to a privileged few at the apex of the power structure\". The main interaction rules involve partnership working, but the Executive Council and Town Planning Board members largely hold business interests and a pro-Beijing mind set, enabling the Hong Kong government to retain its elite consensus politics. The Hong Kong government is the key actor in the cooperative and collaborative arrangements and it plays a crucial role in the governance mode. However, there were shifts in the general and tourism development planning processes after 2004, which brought in more elements of pluralism and which made the government's task of overall steering or metagovernance more complex. The changes are now discussed.",

There were significant changes in this application process, however, after the Town Planning Ordinance of 2004, and these have affected the governance modes of tourism development planning. Before the 2004 Ordinance, anyone, and not necessarily property owners, could submit a tourism planning application to the Town Planning Board for consideration (Hong Kong SAR Government, 2005) (Fig. 2) . Applications were circulated for comments from other relevant government departments, the applications and associated comments would then be sent to the Town Planning Board for consideration within two months, and then applicants would be notified by the Board whether their applications were deferred, rejected, approved with conditions, or approved without conditions, with stated reasons. Applicants were also advised about their right to seek another review by the Board.",

There was also no legal requirement for applicants to seek the views of affected property and land owners or of nearby residents before submitting planning applications. The rules of interaction of this pro-growth mode, therefore, were to restrict decision-making to the Town Planning Board and to recruit Board members who held interests similar to the government's pro-growth interests. Government played key roles in these institutional arrangements. It provided the legal planning framework, and the Chief Executive directly appointed the Board members, so it was possible to appoint people with interests and mind sets similar to those of government. Also, the government officials with planning and development roles provided the Board with crucial information for its decision making.",

The 2004 Ordinance included major alterations in the planning application system which entailed some significant changes to Hong Kong's tourism planning governance mode. First, applicants for planning approvals were required to obtain written consent from property owners, or to serve a notice to them, before making applications. And, second, all applications needed to be published for public comments for a three-week period. These two changes meant that for the first time all affected owners, nearby residents and other interested parties had the opportunity to be consulted and involved. Thus, unlike before, the public, including affected owners and other interested parties, can now view the applications and express their views to the Board, although final decisions still rest with the Town Planning Board members. Third, while the Town Planning Board members retained the key decisions, there were also changes in the composition of the Board which deals with planning applications. First, there was increasing representation of non-official Board members, who now are from the academic, environmental protection and historical preservation sectors. The non-official Board members for the 2012e2014 term are from the following sectors: real estate, surveying and construction (5), architecture and urban planning (4), law (4), engineering (3), social welfare (2), banking (2), business (2), historical preservation (2), geography and environmental management (2), logistics and transport (2), and education (1) (Wan, 2013) . Finally, all the Town Planning Board meetings are open \"except for the deliberation parts in the consideration of representations/comments on plans and of planning applications and reviews, and for discussion of confidential items\" (Fung, 2005, p. 4) . The public can observe the meetings through a live broadcast in a public viewing room.",

If the Board did not propose amendments to the draft plan, then it (with or without amendment) together with the objections that were not withdrawn, would be submitted to the Governor/Chief Executive, who could either approve, reject, or refer the amended plans to the Town Planning Board for further amendment. Thus, before 1999 Hong Kong's tourism development-related plan-making system reflected a pro-growth mode based on cooperative arrangements between government and business which allowed these partners to safeguard their economic interests.

Fig. 3 shows the new plan-making system.

But after 1999, the Board could ask the Planning Department to first prepare a \"concept plan\" and a \"preliminary layout plan\" through extensive public consultation, such as through using roadshows, radio broadcasts, district consultations, and seminars. Based on the collected public comments, the Town Planning Board would then prepare an Outline Zoning Plan for formal public inspection and consultation for two months.

Hence, since 2005 Hong Kong's plan-making system for tourism development has shifted from a pro-growth mode to a hybrid mode with pro-growth and pluralist elements.

First, relatively few studies in tourism have explored the modes of tourism governance in destinations, and the typology of such modes and the associated analytical framework that were explained here can assist researchers in examining this issue. The typology of tourism governance modes was linked with an analytical framework of four attributes (the key actors, their policy agendas/objectives, the rules of interaction, and the roles and strategies of government) as an operational tool to assist with identifying which governance mode might be closest to the specific circumstances in different cases. The few previous studies of tourism governance modes have limitations in this respect. Erku\u015f -\u20ac Ozt\u00fcrk (2011), for example, also adopts Pierre (1999)'s typology in an assessment of tourism governance in Amsterdam and Antalya, but he does not identify an analytical framework of attributes in order to assist in evaluating the governance processes in specific places. Hall (2011) identifies from the policy science literature another valuable typology of modes of governance which can be applied to tourism, namely, hierarchies, communities, networks and markets, but these are rather broad for the specific task of distinguishing between the particular characteristics of different destinations.",

The typologies of modes of governance are \"ideal types\" (Erku\u015f -\u20ac Ozt\u00fcrk, 2011; Hall, 2011; Wan, 2013) , and the case of Hong Kong demonstrates that in practice tourism governance can resemble more than one \"ideal type\" mode. From being governed by what can usefully be depicted as a broadly pro-growth mode before 1966, it is helpful analytically to argue that Hong Kong has shifted since the early 1970s to a hybrid pro-growth and pluralist mode. The paper suggested that this reflects pressures to strengthen the city's economy through restructuring in the context of capital accumulation and global capitalism, including the shift to services due to Hong Kong's cost structure and the emerging prominence of financial services, real estate and tourism, and also that it reflects the overlapping but differing interests of entrepreneurs, the rising middle classes, and the less well-off. A largely pro-growth mode was seen as unable to address the increasingly diversified community demands. The Hong Kong authorities judged that it had to respond to some of the calls for greater democracy, and this has helped the authorities largely to retain social stability and political legitimacy. Yet, a pure pluralist mode might be considered sub-optimal for the city's overall economic development as it could hamper the prominence of economic efficiency objectives in the city's planning, objectives which have boosted economic development since the 1980s and 1990s in the face of rapid changes associated with the increasing ties with China and economic restructuring. The government has steered a course which helps to maintain its ruling legitimacy and avoids various crises by adopting a strategy that adequately addresses both economic and societal interests. The adoption of a hybrid mode, both pro-growth and pluralist, has helped the government to deal with the changing situation.",

For example, it was found that the strategies and processes for widening the potential influence or power of civil society after 2004 varied between different constituent parts of Hong Kong's tourism planning system. This is consistent with Pierre's (1999, p. 377) argument that \"cities frequently display conflicts between different models of governance supported by different segments of the city administration\". The new system for planning applications has widened participation to include affected land owners and parties, but with the ultimate say left to the Town Planning Board; and the new process for plan-making has expanded the potential for public involvement, but the final plan still needs to be approved by the Chief Executive. It can be suggested that greater room for public involvement is permitted in plan-making than is the case for planning applications because plan-making involves a larger scale of development and it affects many more interests and people than do specific planning applications. Thus, in a society that has increasingly diversified demands the government sees the need to include wider public views in the plan-making processes, although the Chief Executive still has the ultimate power to control the final plan-making decisions. The hybrid mode of tourism governance, therefore, involved hybridity between its plan-making and planning application systems. Through the combination of these two strategies and processes in the two planning systems the Hong Kong government has been able to strike a new relationship between efficiency and equity without losing its power and legitimacy to steer.",

Political economy approaches are quite infrequently applied in tourism (Bramwell, 2011; Sharpley, 2008; Wan, 2013; Wang & Bramwell, 2012) , but this perspective was seen to be very useful here in understanding how the modes of governance evolved in the city. It was suggested that the shifting from a pro-growth governance mode to a hybrid mode with more pluralist elements has enabled Hong Kong's government to alter its strategies to stabilize the economy and social relations while securing its ruling legitimacy. Nevertheless, while the economic and political circumstances were important, it was also argued that much also depends fundamentally on social practices, the agency of actors, and the contingency of particular circumstances (Bramwell, 2011) . This study also indicates the merits of relating temporal continuities and changes in a tourism destination's modes of governance to the destination's overall evolving political economy. A carefully traced historical perspective on political economy can greatly assist in explaining how and why tourism governance in specific places retains its essential character or evolves over time (Pastras & Bramwell, 2013 Bill Bramwell is Emeritus Professor of International Tourism Studies at Sheffield Hallam University, UK.
