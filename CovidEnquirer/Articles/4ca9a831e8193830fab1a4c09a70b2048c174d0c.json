            "text": "Globally, respiratory infections are one of the primary causes of illness in developing countries, specifically among children younger than 5 years old. However, the etiology of these acute respiratory infections diagnosed as pneumonia is determined in only 75% of the cases. 1 Of these identified respiratory pathogens, typically determined with molecular techniques, viruses account for approximately 15% of the infections. 2 Nonetheless, by employing molecular diagnostic techniques in hospital-based studies, one can typically identify up to 90% of the viral agents associated with respiratory tract infections. 3 Human bocavirus (HBoV) was originally described by Allander et al. 4 among children with respiratory tract infection in Sweden, 2005. Since then, it has been reported in different countries 3, [5] [6] [7] and in patients of differing ages, although the majority of the infections have been detected in young children. 5, 6 Although our understanding of the epidemiology and genetic characteristics of this novel virus has been enhanced with the increasing information, we are still unable to discern the role of this virus in respiratory infections. [8] [9] [10] Longtin et al. and Garcia-Garcia et al. have also identified the virus among asymptomatic children. 11 The virus has also been identified in fecal samples of Spanish and Brazilian children with diarrheal symptoms. 12 Additionally, it is not uncommon to find the virus in co-infection with other known pathogens. Given these inconclusive and confusing findings, the scientific community remains divided as to whether HBoV is a true respiratory pathogen.",

            "text": "This study, performed in a population of participants in a respiratory surveillance program in three different geographical sites in Latin America, presents evidence of the circulation of HBoV in Argentina, Nicaragua and Peru. The virus had previously been reported to circulate in Brazilian children. 5, 14, 15 The prevalence reported in the original study from Allander et al. was 3AE5% in hospitalized patients in Sweden. Additional studies, mostly among hospitalized children and infants with respiratory infections, have identified prevalence proportions ranging from 1AE5% to 19% in different regions. 11, 16, 17 The different values reported from these studies may be because of sampling techniques, study populations and the sensitivity of the diagnostic assay. 18 The prevalence of infection detected in our study in Argentina is consistent with these findings. However, the prevalence rates that we identified in Nicaragua and Peru are higher than have been previously reported for this virus. The reason why these two sites have higher prevalence rates may be related to the circulation of the virus in these areas caused by appropriate environmental conditions (susceptible population, climate, geography, migration, etc.) that may also favor persistent infection as has been reported in other studies. 19 Despite the difference in prevalence rates among the three sites, the age and gender distribution of our samples are similar and comparable to other studies with a peak in HBoV infection in children 1 year of age and a slight increase in detection among boys. In our study, as in previous studies, HBoV has been identified as a co-infecting agent in a high proportion (ranging from 9AE5% to 83AE0%) of respiratory illnesses. 4, 6, [20] [21] [22] [23] The role of HBoV as a pathogen remains unclear. 8, 9 In our study, we detected HBoV as the most common viral agent, i.e. 23AE2% of the total samples tested. However, we were unable to detect an agent in 49AE0% of the samples, and we did not test for some known respiratory viruses, such as human rhinovirus, coronavirus or for bacterial agents. Previous studies have shown that upper respiratory infections among children may be caused by a variety of viral agents and very frequently occur as co-infections 24, 25 , and this may be the case for these HBoV-positive samples. Furthermore, additional studies have detected HBoV in fecal samples of patients with both respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms 12, 26, 27 , and in Brazil, there was evidence of infection in children with only symptoms of gastrointestinal distress, no respiratory symptoms. 14 This may suggest an alternative transmission route for the virus and its pathogenic role in the gastrointestinal tract. However, a recent study by Garcia-Garcia et al. 28 demonstrated that HBoV infection among hospitalized children with respiratory symptoms was more frequent than in healthy ones.",

The age and gender distribution is similar to what has been reported previously. HBoV was found in 23% of the samples collected from children with respiratory symptoms, which is somewhat higher to what has been reported previously. As in previous studies, HBoV was found mainly as a co-infecting agent in our samples, making it difficult to determine whether it is a pathogenic virus, exacerbates the symptoms of other viral infections22 , or is merely a persistent non-pathogenic (commensal) virus.19 Routine testing for HBoV among patients with respiratory symptoms should be included in the testing strategy among any respiratory illness surveillance system, as has been previously suggested.3 Addendum G Salmon-Mulanovich, JM Montgomery, Blazes DL Blazes, AG Lescano contributed to the concept and design of the study. G Salmon-Mulanovich, M Sovero analyzed and interpreted the data. VA Laguna-Torres, TJ Kochel, G Chauca, JM Montgomery, Blazes DL Blazes, AG Lescano revised the intellectual content of the manuscript.
