            "text": "Global health governance is increasingly focused on epidemic and pandemic health emergencies that require an interdisciplinary approach to accessing scientific knowledge to guide preparedness and crisis response. Of acute concern is Zoonotic disease, that can spread from animals to humans and easily cross borders. The \"grave situation\" of the Chinese Coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak seems to have justified these fears and is currently the focus of an international mobilisation of scientific and state resources (Wood, 2020) . Covid-19 started in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province and has been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The interactions currently taking place, nationally and internationally between evidence, policy and politics, are complex and relate to theories around the role of the researcher as broker or advocate and the form and function of research policy networks (Pielk, 2007) and (Ward et al., 2011) and (Georgalakis and Rose, 2019) . In this paper I seek to explore these areas further through the lens of the UK's response to Ebola in West Africa. This policy context has been selected in relation to the division of the affected countries between key donors. The British Government assumed responsibility for Sierra Leone and sought guidance from health officials, academics, humanitarian agencies and clinicians.",

The mobilisation of anthropological perspectives towards enhancing the humanitarian intervention was celebrated as an example of research impact by the UK's Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and Department for International Development (DFID) (ESRC, 2016 ). An eminent group of social scientists called for future global emergency health interventions to learn from this critical moment of interdisciplinary cooperation and mutual understanding (S. A. Abramowitz et al., 2015) .

The first question will explore the degree to which social scientists and specifically anthropologists and medical anthropologists, were incorporated into the UK policy network.

Hagel et al. show how research on the Ebola virus rapidly increased during the crisis in West Africa and identified a network of institutions affiliated through co-authorship. Unfortunately, their data tell us very little about the type of research being published and how it was connected into policy processes (Hagel et al., 2017) . In contrast, this paper seeks to inform the ongoing movements promoting interdisciplinarity as key to addressing global health challenges. Zoonotic disease has been the subject of particular concerns around the, \"connections and disconnections between social, political and ecological worlds\" (Bardosh, 2016, P. 232) . With the outbreak of Covid-19 in China at the end of 2019, its rapid spread overseas and predictions of more frequent and more deadly pandemics and epidemics in the future, the importance of breaking down barriers between policy actors, humanitarians, social scientists, doctors and medical scientists can only increase with time.",

            "text": "Before we look at detailed accounts of events relating to the UK policy network, first we must consider what the key policy issues were relating to an anthropological response versus a purely clinical one. Anthropological literature exists, from previous outbreaks, documenting the cultural practices that affected the spread of Ebola (Hewlett and Hewlett, 2007) . The main concerns relate to how local practices may accelerate the spread of the virus and the need to address these in order to lower infection rates. Ebola is highly contagious, particularly from contamination by bodily fluids. In West Africa, many local customs exist around burial practices that clinicians believe heighten the risk to communities. Common characteristics of these are, the washing of bodies by family members, passing clothing belonging to the deceased to family and the touching of the body (Richards, 2016) . Another concern, as the crisis unfolded, was people attempting to provide home care to victims of the virus. The clinical response was to create isolation units or Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs) in which to assess and treat suspected cases (West & von Saint Andr\u00e9-von Arnim, 2014) . Community based care centres were championed by the UK Government but their deployment came late and opinion was divided around their effectiveness. Clinicians regarded ETUs as an essential part of the response and wanted to educate people to discourage them from engaging in what they regarded as deeply unsafe practices, including home care (Walsh and Johnson, 2018) and (MSF, 2015) .",

Anthropologist, Paul Richards, argues that agencies' and clinicians' lack of understanding of local customs worsened the crisis (Richards, 2016) and that far from being ignorant and needing rescuing from themselves, communities had coping strategies of their own. His studies from Sierra Leone and Liberia relate how some villages isolated themselves, created their own burial teams and successfully protected those who came in contact with suspected cases with makeshift protective garments (Richards, 2014a) . Anthropologists working in West Africa during the epidemic prioritised studies of social mobilisation and community engagement and worked with communities directly on Ebola transmission. Sharon Abramowitz, in her review of the anthropological response across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, provides examples from the field work of Chiekh Niang (Fleck, 2015) , Sylvain Faye, Juliene Anoko, Almudena Mari Saez, Fernanda Falero, Patricia Omidian, several Medicine Sans Frontiers (MSF) anthropologists and others (S. Abramowitz, 2017) . However, Abramowitz argues that learning generated by these ethnographic studies was largely ignored by the mainstream response.",

Particularly relevant is Peter Haas' theory of epistemic communities. Haas helped define epistemic communities and how they differ from other policy communities, such as interest groups and advocacy coalitions (Haas, 1992) . They share common principles and analytical and normative beliefs (causal beliefs). They have an authoritative claim to policy relevant expertise in a particular domain and Haas claims that policy actors will routinely place them above other interest groups in their level of expertise. He believes that epistemic communities and smaller more temporary collaborations within them, can influence policy. He observes that in times of crisis and acute uncertainty, policy actors often turn to them for advice.",

Namely, the UK was to lead in Sierra Leone, the United States in Liberia and the French in Guinea. This seems to have focused social scientists in the UK on engaging effectively with a government and wider scientific community who seemed to want to draw on their expertise. This was a relatively close-knit community of scholars who already worked together, co-published and cited each other's work and in many cases worked in the same academic institutions. Crucially, their ranks were swelled by a small number of epidemiologists and medical anthropologists who shared their concerns.",

Things began to happen quickly when the WHO announced in early September of that year that conventional biomedical responses to the outbreak were failing (WHO, 2014a) . This acted like a siren call to social scientists incensed by the reported treatment of local communities and the way in which a narrative had emerged blaming local customs and ignorance for the rapid spread of the virus. British anthropologist, James Fairhead, hastily organised a special panel on Ebola at the African Studies Association (ASA) Annual Conference, that was taking place at the University of Sussex (UoS) on the September 10, 2014. Amongst the panellists were: Anthropologist Melissa Leach, Director of the Institute of Development Studies (IDS); Audrey Gazepo, University of Ghana, Medical anthropologist Melissa Parker from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM); Anthropologist and public health specialist, Anne Kelly from Kings College London and Stefan Elbe, UoS. Informally, after the conference, this group discussed the idea of an online repository or platform for the supply of regionally relevant social science (F. Martineau et al., 2017) . This would later become the Ebola Response Anthropology Platform (ERAP). In the days and weeks that followed it was the personal and professional connections of these individuals that shaped the network engaging with the UK's intervention.",

Discussions took place on the funding and organisation of the anthropological response. The Government was already drawing on the expertise and capacity of Public Health England (PHE), the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and the Department of Health (DoH), to drive its response but social scientists had no seat at the table. The Government's Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Sally Davies called a meeting of the Ebola Scientific Assessment and Response Group (ESARG), on the 19th September, focused on issues which included community transmission of Ebola. Leach's inclusion as the sole anthropologist was largely thanks to Farrar and Chris Whitty, DFID's Chief Scientific Advisor (M Leach, 2014). There was already broad acceptance of the need for the response to focus on community engagement and the WHO had been issuing guidance on how to engage and what kind of messaging to use for those living in the worst affected areas (WHO, 2014c) . In their account of these events three of the central actors from the UK's anthropological community describe how momentum gathered quickly and that: \"it felt as if we were pushing at an open door\" (F. Martineau et al., 2017, 481) .",

It was shortly after this that the CMO, at the behest of the Government's Cabinet Office Briefing Room (COBRA), formed the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies on Ebola (SAGE). By its first meeting on the October 16, 2014, British troops were on the ground along with volunteers from the UK National Health Service (NHS) (STC, 2016). Leach was pulled into this group along with most of the members of ESARG that had met the previous month. It was decided in this initial meeting to set up a social science sub-group including Whitty, Leach and the entire steering group of the newly established ERAP (SAGE, 2014a). This included not just British-based anthropologists but also Paul Richards and Esther Mokuwa from Njala University, Sierra Leone.

In this case, the network comprises of nodes who are the individuals identified as being directly involved in some of the key events just described. A second set of nodes are the events or interactions themselves. Content analysis of secondary sources linked to these events provides an unobtrusive method for identifying in some detail the actors who will have left traces of their involvement. SNA allows us to establish these actors' ties to common nodes (they were part of the same committee or event or contributed to the same reports.) Furthermore, we can assign non-network related attributes to each of our nodes such as gender, location, role and organisation affiliation type. Not only does this approach provide a quantitative assessment of who was involved and through which channels but the mathematical foundations of SNA allow for whole network analysis of cohesion across certain groups. You may calculate levels of homophily (the tendency of individuals to associate with similar others) between genders, disciplines and organisational type and identify sub-networks and the super-connectors that bridge them (S.

Whereas gender and location are verifiable, the choice of whether an individual is an international policy actor or a national policy actor must be inferred from their official role during the crisis period. Sometimes this can be based on the identity of their home institution. Given DFID's central focus on overseas development assistance, its officials have been classified as internationals, rather than nationals. In some cases, individuals may be qualified clinicians or epidemiologists but their role in the crisis may have been primarily policy related and not medical or scientific.

Four types of attribute are assigned to these nodes: gender, location (global north or south), organisation type and organisational role. Attributes have been identified through an internet search of institutional websites, LinkedIn and related online resources. Role and organisation type are recorded for the period of the crisis. The total number of nodes given at the bottom of Fig. 2 is slightly lower due to the anonymity of five individuals whose gender and role could not be established. Looking at this distribution of attributes across the whole network one can make the following observations in relation to how prominently different characteristics are represented: I. Females slightly outnumber males in the social science category but there are twice as many male 'scientists other' than female. They are a combination of clinicians, virologists, epidemiologists and other biomedical expertise. II. There are just nine southern based nodes out of a total of 134 and none of these are policy makers or practitioners. This is racially and geographically a northern network with just a sliver of West African perspectives. These included, Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr, veteran Ebola campaigner and current Mayor of Freetown, four academics from Njala University and development professionals working in the Sierra Leone offices of agencies such as the UNFAO. III. Although 'scientists other' only just outnumber social scientists this is heavily skewed by one of the eight interaction nodesthe Lessons for Development Conferencewhich was primarily a learning event and not part of the advisory processes around the response. Many individuals who participated in this event are not active in any of the other seven interactions. If we remove these non-active nodes from the network, you get just 23 social scientists compared to 32 'scientist other'. The remaining core policy network of 77 individuals appears to be weighted towards the biomedical sciences.",

We can see here the visualisation of slightly higher centrality scores than for the government scientific advisors on the left. By treating this as a relational network we observe that interactions like the establishment of a SAGE sub-group for social scientists increased the homophily of the right side of the network and reduced its interconnectivity with the whole network. Although, one must be cautious about assigning too much significance to the position of individual nodes in a whole network analysis, the central location of the two social scientists and a DFID official closely correspond to the accounts of the crisis. This heterogeneous brokerage demonstrates the tendency of certain types of actors to be the sole link between dissimilar nodes (Hamilton et al., 2020) . Likewise, some boundary nodes or outliers, such as one of the MOD's advisors at the bottom of the network, are directly mentioned in the qualitative accounts.

She refers to adult education literature and its implications for what decision makers learn from epistemic communities, or to put it another way, the cognitive influence of research evidence (Dunlop, 2009) .

Where they saw the provision of home care kits as an ethical necessity, many clinicians, humanitarians and global health professionals regarded home care as deeply unethical with the potential to lead to a two tier system of support (F. Martineau et al., 2017) and (Whitty et al., 2014) . In Sierra Leone, Irish diplomat Sinead Walsh was baffled by what she saw as the blocking of the distribution of home care kits.

Moira Faul's research on global education policy networks proposes that far from being \"flat,\" networks can augment existing power relations and knowledge hierarchies (Faul, 2016) .

However, there is some indication of different groups or networks favouring different narratives. The International Development Select Committee (IDC) was very clear in its final report that social science had been a force for good in the response and recommended that DFID grow its internal anthropological capacity (IDC, 2016a, b) . This contrasts to the report of the Science and Technology Committee (STC), which despite including evidence from at least one anthropologist, does not make a direct reference to anthropology in its report (STC, 2016) . This is perhaps the public health officials in their core domain of infectious disease outbreaks reasserting their established authority. This sector has been described as the UK's \"Biomedical Bubble\" which benefits from much higher pubic support and funding than the social sciences (Jones and Wilsdon, 2018) . Just the presence of anthropologists in an evidence session of the STC is a very rare event in contrast to the IDC which regularly reaches out to social scientists. Not everyone agrees that the threat of under-investing in social science was the primary issue. The STC's report highlights the view that there was a lack of front line clinicians represented on committees advising the UK Government, particularly from aid organisations (STC, 2016) .",

The Social Science in Humanitarian Action Platform, which involves many of the same researchers who were part of the Sierra Leone response, has subsequently been supported by UNICEF, USAID and Joint Initiative on Epidemic Preparedness (JIEP) with funding from DFID and Wellcome. Its network of social science advisers have been producing briefings to assist with the Ebola response in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) (Farrar, 2019) and have mobilised in response to the Covid-19 respiratory illness epidemic.",

By analysing data pertaining to researchers' and policy professionals' participation in policy networks one can test assumptions around interdisciplinarity and identify powerful knowledge gatekeepers. Detailed qualitative accounts of policy processes needn't be available, as they were in this case, to employ this methodology. Assuming the researcher has access to meeting minutes and other records of who attended which events or who was a member of which committees and groups, similar analysis of network homophily and centrality will be possible. The greatest potential for learning, with significant policy and research implications, comes from mixed methods approaches. By combining qualitative research to populate your network with a further round of data gathering to understand it better, you can reveal the social and political dynamics truly driving evidence use and decision making (Oliver and Faul, 2018) . Although this study lacked this scope, it has still successfully identified the shape of the research-policy network that emerged around the UK led response to Ebola and the clustering of actors within it.",

However, it favoured the views of government scientists with their emphasis on epidemiology and the medical response. It was also almost entirely lacking in West African members. Nonetheless, it was largely thanks to a strong political demand for anthropological knowledge, in response to perceived community violence and distrust, that social scientists got a seat at the table. This was brokered by a small group of individuals from both government and research organisations, who had prior relationships to build on. The emergent inter-epistemic community was only partially connected into the policy network and we should reject the description of the whole network as trans-disciplinary. Social scientists were most successful in engaging when they framed their expertise in terms of already widely accepted concepts, such as the need for better communications with communities. They were least successful when their evidence countered strongly held beliefs in areas such as home care. Their high level of homophily as a group, or sub network, only deepened the ability of decision makers to ignore them when it suited them to do so.",

It was transformative only in as much as it helped the epistemic community itself learn how to operate in this environment. The real achievement has been on influencing longer term evidence use behaviours. They made the case for interdisciplinarity and the value of social science in emergency preparedness and response. The challenge now is moving from the rhetoric to action on complex infectious disease outbreaks. As demonstrated by Ebola in DRC and Covid-19, every global health emergency we face will have its own unique social and political dimensions. We must remain cognisant of the learning arising from the international response to Sierra Leone's tragic Ebola epidemic. It suggests that despite the increasing demand for interdisciplinarity, social science evidence is frequently contested and policy networks have a strong tendency to leave control over its production and use in the hands of others.",
