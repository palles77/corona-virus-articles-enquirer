In Africa, many countries have faced serious challenges in controlling malaria, in part due to major limitations in public health systems and primary health care infrastructure. Although China is a developing country, a set of control strategies and measures in different local settings have been implemented successfully by the National Malaria Control Programme over the last 60 years, with a low cost of investment. It is expected that Chinese experience may benefit malaria control in Africa. This review will address the importance and possibility of China-Africa collaboration in control of malaria in targeted African countries, as well as how to proceed toward the goal of elimination where this is technically feasible.",

According to the World Malaria Report 2013 published by the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2012, there were an estimated 207 million cases of malaria (uncertainty interval 135-287 million), which caused approximately 627,000 deaths (uncertainty interval 473,000-789,000). An estimated 3.4 billion people continue to be at risk of malaria, mostly in Africa and southeast Asia. Approximately 80% of malaria cases and 90% of malaria deaths occurred in Africa (WHO, 2013) .",

According to the statistics, more than 30 million malaria cases were recorded annually during the 1940s and the mortality rate was about 1%. After the establishment of P.R. China in 1949, the government invested significant resources in the control of malaria which was listed as one of the five top parasitic diseases in the country. The reduction of malaria leading to its elimination in P.R. China, the evidence-based prevention strategies, and related malaria prevention and control policies have been synthesised for the National Malaria Control Programmes (NMCPs). As a result, a network of scientific research and surveillance has been established, thousands of professional technical teams have been trained, and the coordination of malaria control within specific zones has been created for the past six decades. Through these interventions, a remarkable achievement of the NMCPs has taken place since the early 1950s. From the 1970s to the 1990s, the annual number of malaria cases significantly declined from 2.4 million to tens of thousands, the endemic regions were sharply shrunk, and falciparum malaria has been eliminated in all regions except for Yunnan and Hainan provinces. By 2009, the national number of malaria cases had been reduced to 14,000. Among 24 malaria-endemic provinces, the malaria incidence in 95% of the counties has dropped below 1 per 10,000 population with only 87 counties over 1 per 10,000. The data indicate that P.R. China has transitioned from malaria control phase to elimination phase (Tang, 1999; Tang, 2009) .",

China by 2020 (National Health and Family Planning Commission of P.R. China, 2009).

An increase in locally acquired cases, from 35 in 2000 to 59 in 2012, was reported from Algeria. Cabo Verde is in the pre-elimination phase, and continues to progress towards eliminating malaria. Algeria is in the elimination phase. Both Algeria and Cabo Verde implement active case detection, case investigation and a quality assurance (QA) system for diagnostic testing guided by a national reference laboratory; they also provide treatment with primaquine for the radical cure of P. vivax and clearance of gametocytes in P. falciparum infections. Eight countries in southern Africa are signatories to the elimination eight (E8) regional initiative launched in March 2009, a goal of which is to achieve the eventual elimination of malaria in the region, with elimination in four countries (Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Swaziland) by 2015.

Most malaria infections in Africa south of the Sahara are caused by P. falciparum, the most severe and life-threatening form of the disease. This region is also home to the most efficient, and therefore deadly, species of mosquitoes that transmit the disease. Moreover, in many African countries, especially in rural areas, poor infrastructure, substandard sanitation, and lack of funding for vector control, diagnostic testing and treatment remain challenges (Agomo et al., 2013; Butler, 2012) . Many countries lacked the infrastructure and resources necessary to mount sustainable campaigns against malaria; as a result, few benefited from historical efforts to eradicate malaria. In Africa, malaria is understood to be both a disease of poverty and a cause of poverty (Ajayi, et al., 2013; Bi & Tong, 2014) . Annual economic growth in countries with high malaria transmission has historically been lower than in countries without malaria. Malaria also has a direct impact on Africa's human resources. Not only does malaria result in lost life and lost productivity due to illness and premature death, but malaria also hampers children's schooling and social development through both absenteeism and permanent neurological and other damage associated with severe episodes of the disease (Malaria in Africa; Chima et al., 2003) .",

In 10 countries of Central Africa, the recent increase in malaria cases and admissions in Sao Tome and Principe may be related to brief disruptions to spraying activities and supply of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACTs); the proportion of the population with access to an ITN within their household was estimated to exceed 50% in five countries; and Angola and Burundi reported delivery of sufficient ACTs to treat >50% patients attending the public health facilities.

On 6-7 May 2013, the Fourth International Roundtable on China-Africa Health Cooperation was held in Gaborone, Botswana to explore new opportunities to strengthen an innovative partnership between China and Africa to cooperate on health issues. The roundtable brought African and Chinese leaders together to share experiences, discuss progress and lessons learned, and to make recommendations on how China-Africa health cooperation could be strengthened. During this roundtable, the major challenges of malaria control and elimination in Africa were identified as follows: 1. Poor infrastructure and substandard health services and coverage; 2. Poor distribution and access to diagnostic services and effective treatment; 3. Limited funding for vector control, diagnostic testing, treatment and surveillance; 4. Cross-border malaria control; 5. Threat of drug and insecticide resistance; and 6. The vicious cycle of poverty and malaria.",

The P.R. China has accumulated experience, which could be shared with countries in Africa, in developing health policy leading to successful interventions but Chinese contribution should not seek to address every aspect of malaria control. It should start with the Test, Treat, and Track (T3) initiative that was advocated by WHO and all partners, and is also of great demand in Africa. To align with the T3 approach, focussing on scaling up diagnostic testing, treatment and surveillance, T3 and the corresponding surveillance manuals were launched in Namibia by the WHO Director-General in April 2012. Each suspected case of malaria will be confirmed with a rapid diagnostic test, treated with an antimalarial medicine, and tracked using a surveillance system (WHO, 2012b). Joint country efforts could be made on scaling-up access to malaria diagnostic testing, access to treatment at the community level in Africa with quality artemisinin-based antimalarial compound medicines, including lifesaving injectable artesunate, and strengthening the malaria surveillance system.

In the aftermath of the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, the Chinese government strengthened its public health disease surveillance system, taking advantage of modern information technology to build an integrated, effective and reliable disease reporting system, the national Notifiable Infectious Diseases Reporting Information System (NIDRIS). This system gathers realtime epidemiologic information on approximately 40 infectious diseases, including malaria, across every province from every hospital and clinic. Based on NIDRIS, a new nationwide web-based automated system for outbreak detection and rapid response, namely the China Infectious Disease Automated-alert and Response System (CIDARS), was developed in 2008. In CIDARS, three aberration detection methods are used to detect the unusual occurrence of 28 notifiable infectious diseases at the county level and transmit information either in real time or on a daily basis. The Internet, computers and mobile phones are used to accomplish rapid signal generation and dissemination, timely reporting and reviewing of the signal response results, which greatly improved the timeliness of malaria case or epidemic detection and response (Yang et al., 2011) .
