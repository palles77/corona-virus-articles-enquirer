Since beginning the \"evolution of Mayo Clinic Proceedings\" initiative in 1999, 1 the journal has experienced an 84% increase in manuscript submissions and a 113% increase in original articles, and submissions are currently increasing at a historic annual rate. Hence, some of our motivation for introducing the new system is simply to better manage traffic. In-house research has determined that increasing the number of submissions is key to improving journal quality. It is no coincidence that recent improvements in the Proceedings impact factor (ISI, Thomson ISI, Philadelphia, Pa) 2 are tightly coupled to the numbers of submissions. Although less tightly coupled, changes in journal readership, as assessed by PERQ/HCI Research (Princeton, NJ), 2 are also related to the number of submissions.",

Much of the current review time is spent contacting reviewers and sending hard copies of articles to them to review. Absent fundamental alterations in our review logistics, these manual-processing delays will limit our ability to further reduce minimal review time. We believe that, from this point forward, improved processing time is possible only by migrating to electronic submissions.
