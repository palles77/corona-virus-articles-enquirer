The recognizing of a specific serum against pAPN to these proteins was investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblotting. The binding ability of the proteins to transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a porcine coronavirus, was analyzed by ELISA. The inhibitory effect of these proteins to cell infection by TGEV was analyzed using plaque assays. Our data indicate that three truncated pAPNs positively reacted with the specific antiserum and the major binding regions of pAPN were limited in regions 36aa-223aa, 349aa-591aa and 592-963aa. The proteins showed discrepant binding activity to either pAPN antibody or TGE virions. Moreover, the truncated proteins blocked the infection of cells by TGEV to different extent. The results suggest that the major antibody-binding domains of pAPN may associate with the receptor-binding determinants. The role of APN is discussed in the context of virus receptor usage.",

It is a type II glycoprotein of about 150-160 kDa, in molecular weight and its large extracellular carboxy-terminal domain contains a pentapeptide catalytic sequence (His-Glu-X-X-His), characteristic of zinc metalloprotease (Hooper, 1994) . APN is distributed on the surface of diverse cell lines, for example, it is expressed on the plasma membranes of granulocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, fibroblasts and synaptic membrane in the central nervous system (Miguel et al., 2002) . It is highly expressed on the surface of the brush border membrane of the enterocytes, where it participates in the final steps of digestion by cleaving peptides preferentially after N-terminal neutral amino acids. It has been suggested that APN is involved in modulating signals of bioactive peptides in the brain (Delmas et al., 1994) .",

            "text": "APN acts as a cellular receptor for several coronaviruses. It is documented that human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) uses human APN (hAPN, also called CD13) and feline APN (fAPN) as their respective receptor. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a porcine coronavirus, which causes severe diarrhea and high mortality rate in seronegative piglets (Ren et al., 2008) . The enveloped virus consists of a positive single-strand RNA approximately 28.5-kb in size. TGEV has four major structural proteins: the spike (S), the integral membrane (M) protein, the nucleocapsid (N) protein and a small envelope protein (sM) (Spaan et al., 1988; Laude et al., 1993; Penzes et al., 2001) . TGEV S protein plays important roles in initiating cell infection by interacting with porcine APN, pAPN (Gebauer et al., 1991; Enjuanes et al., 1992; Schwegmann-Wessels et al., 2003; Ren et al., 2008) and sialic acid residues (Krempl et al., 1997 (Krempl et al., , 2000 Krempl and Herrler, 2001) . The pAPN has been identified as a functional receptor for TGEV, although this virus can also use fAPN as another receptor (Delmas et al., 1992; Tresnan and Holmes, 1998) . At present, the role of APN in coronavirus infection is not fully understood.",

In an earlier study, we expressed the full-length pAPN without the signal peptide and the protein has been used to raise specific polyclonal antiserum (Liu et al., 2009) . In this study, we expressed four truncated proteins covering different regions of the whole mature pAPN. The recognizing of the anti-pAPN antibody to the proteins indicated that three regions, 36aa-223aa, 349aa-591aa and 592-963aa were the major antibody-binding domains. This was firstly identified by Western blot and then confirmed by ELISA. The bacterial expression system is very optimal for protein expression due to its advantages consisting of low cost, convenience and high fermentation potential and numerous heterologous proteins have been expressed in this system (Kataoka et al., 2004; Hamann and Lange, 2006; Yin et al., 2007; Hino et al., 2008; Cai et al., 2009; Ren et al., 2010a,b; Li et al., 2010; Meng et al., 2010) . In this study, the specificity of the polyclonal antibody raised against the bacterially expressed pAPN was clarified by including a control rabbit antibody generated by immunizing IBV S1 protein expressed in the same way as the pAPN proteins. It is known that pAPN serves as a cellular receptor for several group I coronaviruses including HCoV-229E, TGEV, FIPV and canine coronavirus (CCV) (Delmas et al., 1992; Yeager et al., 1992; Tresnan et al., 1996) . Therefore, in addition to investigation on the binding between the truncated proteins with anti-pAPN antibody, the binding ability between TGE virions and the proteins was compared. Our results indicated that other three truncated pAPN proteins had stronger binding activity than T/pAPN2, suggesting the binding domains of pAPN identified in this study are important functional sites for recognizing antibody and interacting with TGEV. Since the truncated pAPN proteins react with the pAPN antibody to different extent, the identified domains in the pAPN may represent different epitopes in the pAPN.",

            "text": "The TGEV S protein is responsible for initiating the cell infection by interacting with the cellular receptor, pAPN. In this study, we analyzed the neutralizing effect of the truncated pAPN on cell infection by TGEV. Our data showed that the different amino acid regions had discrepant inhibition abilities. Among the four truncated pAPNs, the region (T/pAPN1), amino acids 36-348 showed the best inhibitory effect on TGEV infection, and this region also had the strongest binding activity with the anti-pAPN serum and viruses. Therefore, we suppose that this region should contain the major receptor sites for TGEV and neutralization determinants. Because this region encompasses the T/pAPN2 that showed a poor binding activity, the determinant should be localized in the amino acids 36-223. It has been shown that, analogously to the human APN protein, a region within the amino-terminal part of the feline APN protein (encompassing amino acids 132-295) is essential for its receptor function of human CoV (Kolb et al., 1997) . There are some overlaid regions between the identified determinants among pAPN, hAPN and fAPN. At the same time, the APN sequences from different species share a high homologous identity (70-80% amino acid identity) (Tusell et al., 2007) . Therefore, the binding determinant domains of pAPN may be also important in the counterpart of hAPN and fAPN. As far as the ability of the pAPN proteins to neutralize TGEV infection in vitro is concerned, the current results, together with our previous finding indicated that both full-length pAPN and the amino-terminal part of pAPN were able to neutralize TGEV completely (Liu et al., 2009 ). However, the binding activity of the truncated pAPNs to TGEV or pAPN-antiserum was lower than matured pAPN protein in our ELISA analysis. This result gave rise to another possibility that the complementation of other domains in the pAPN may be required in virus neutralization and antibody binding. In addition, it has been proved that four major antigenic sites of TGEV S protein is in the half of its amino terminus (S1), it would be therefore interesting to analyze the interaction between TGEV S1 and the truncated pAPN proteins in the future.",

            "text": "Most APN proteins serve as a species-specific receptor for coronaviruses, for example, human APN only mediates the infection of human coronavirus 229E, and pAPN exclusively mediates TGEV infection (Hegyi and Kolb, 1998) . This principle is not always true for several APN proteins in terms of their roles as species-specific receptors for coronaviruses. Transfection of fAPN into cells renders the infection of TGEV, it is therefore suggestive that fAPN is another receptor for TGEV (Tresnan et al., 1996; Kolb et al., 1997) . It has been reported that aa 704-831 of fAPN was required for entry of TGEV, feline coronavirus (FCoV), and CCV, particularly, mutational analysis of APN indicated that the amino acid region 732-746 in fAPN is indispensable for TGEV entry (Tusell et al., 2007) . In our study, the homologous region in pAPN was identified as one of the major binding regions (T/pAPN4) in ELISA, and it blocked TGEV infection in vitro, confirming the importance of the functional domain. Previously, fAPN has been identified as a receptor for an avian coronavirus, namely, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The assertion was based on the observation that the hamster kidney fibroblasts became permissive to IBV strain Ark 99 after transfection with a fAPN cDNA (Miguel et al., 2002) . Interestingly, both transient transfection and stable expression of fAPN on the same cell line (BHK cells) rescued FIPV and TGEV infection in non-permissive BHK cells; however, fAPN expression did not rescue infection by the prototype IBV strain Mass41 (Chu et al., 2007) . In another report, TGEV was found to use a human/bovine APN chimera as a receptor, although it is unable to replicate in bovine cells (Benbacer et al., 1997) . These paradoxical results complicate the delineation of APN as a cellular receptor for virus infection. Additionally, there are amino acid differences in the APN proteins from different species, therefore, more virus strains, cell lines as well as related receptor genes should be analyzed to completely elucidate the mechanism of coronavirus infection in the context of receptor usage.",

Their ability in binding to either an anti-pAPN antibody or TGE virions are indicated inferred from the results of Western blot, plaque asssays or ELISA. \"+\" means positive reaction or effect; \"\u2212\" means negative result. The infection inhibition rate shows the maximum inhibition ability of the pAPN proteins to cell infection by TGEV. It should be noted that the sizes of the lines are not proportional to the length of the amino acid chain. The details on the inhibition ability of the pAPN proteins to TGEV infection or binding to the antibody or virions are shown in other figures.",
