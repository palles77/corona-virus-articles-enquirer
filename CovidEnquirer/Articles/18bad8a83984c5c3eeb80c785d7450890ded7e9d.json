The barriers to achieving this goal include overcoming HIV-1 envelope (Env) sequence diversity to rapidly elicit protective broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) and nonneutralizing humoral and cellular responses. 1e3 In the early years of HIV vaccinology, vaccine development proceeded along traditional pathways that focused on the humoral arm of the immune system 4 as other successful preventive vaccines used antibody binding and function as their correlates of protection. 5 In fact, the classic approach of isolating, inactivating, and injecting whole or partial microorganisms that cause disease had been successfully used since 1796, 6e8 and such approaches were initially attempted for HIV-1. For example, a 1999 mouse study using formaldehyde-inactivated virions was promising, 9 but subsequent analysis found the result to be an artifact. 10 Attenuated HIV-1 was seriously considered as a vaccine candidate until long-term results of naturally occurring attenuated HIV-1 infection, such as the nef deleted strain infecting the Sydney Blood Bank Cohort, 11 produced evidence of immunologic damage. 12 A concerted effort for vaccine testing was undertaken by the AIDS Vaccine Evaluation Group and Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group. These consortia, along with several other groups, conducted early-phase HIV-1 vaccine studies using recombinant HIV-1 gp160 or gp120 subunit proteins as immunogens. Results of these trials were generally discouraging because they suggested tolerability but not efficacy. 13e15 Regardless, some immunogens proceeded toward efficacy trials as early as 1999.",

In particular, the San Franciscoebased VaxGen Inc completed 2 Phase IIb/ III trials in men who have sex with men and women (VAX004) and intravenous drug users (VAX003). Both studies assessed a protein-based vaccine (AIDSVAX) that contained gp120 proteins from various HIV-1 subtypes. 16, 17 The results of VAX004 were again disappointing, with an HIV-1 infection rate of 6.7% in the vaccinated group compared with 7.0% in the placebo group. As in VAX003, there was no demonstrable efficacy, and neither had a significant effect on viral load or CD4 + T-lymphocyte cell counts in those persons who did become infected with HIV-1. 16, 17 Despite these discouraging results, there was pressure to advance vaccine science for HIV-1, including the establishment of the Dale and Betty Bumpers Vaccine Research Center (VRC) at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, and programs to incentivize commercial vaccine development. 18 In this political environment, a decision was made to undertake the RV144 Phase III efficacy trial, which was designed to reassess AIDSVAX in a heterologous prime-boost strategy. 19, 20 This trial involved priming the immune system with a canarypox-based vector that contained genetically engineered versions of HIV-1 env, gag, and pol genes (ALVAC) and boosting with ALVAC and the alum-adjuvanted protein vaccine AIDSVAX. This trial was highly controversial because multiple early-phase clinical trials revealed that the components were poorly immunogenic when given in isolation. 21e25 Proponents argued that the trial provided an opportunity to test the feasibility of the prime-boost design and to test for cellular immune correlates of protection, 22 whereas opponents emphasized the excessive cost of the trial and the high likelihood of failure because of its use of immunogens that had previously induced only modest T-cell and humoral responses with no evidence of broad virus neutralization when administered alone or in combination. 22, 23 There was little optimism that this strategy would succeed.",

            "text": "When early vaccine candidates failed to elicit broadly protective antibody responses, the HIV-1 vaccine field shifted its focus to vaccines that would stimulate protective CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell responses. Several animal studies suggested that vaccine strategies that targeted cellular responses might be successful in preventing infection. 26e29 In one such study, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)einfected macaques with suppressed SIV replication experienced increased replication when their CD8 + T cells were depleted, 30 suggesting that this subset of T cells was important for controlling viral replication. HIV-infected elite controllers provided further impetus for pursuing this strategy because it was discovered that their impressive viral control was associated with potent and broad cellular responses. 31, 32 This work gave preclinical support for the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN)eled Phase IIb trials, STEP (HVTN 502) and Phambili (HVTN 503), which were designed to stimulate the cellular response. 33 In both trials, healthy HIV-1euninfected adults who were considered high risk for HIV-1 acquisition were immunized with a replicationdeficient human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) vector with clade B HIV-1 gene inserts (gag, pol, and nef). 29, 34 Interim analysis of the STEP trial revealed higher rates of HIV-1 transmission in the vaccine group compared with the placebo group despite evidence of a robust humoral immune response, 29 leading to early termination of both trials, 34 disappointment in the field, 33 and fear in the volunteer community. 35 Post hoc analysis found that the subgroups of uncircumcised males and persons with preexisting Ad5 neutralizing antibodies had increased HIV-1 infection rates. 36, 37 Two years later, the 2009 report of RV144 trial results restored a sense of optimism because the regimen had a modest vaccine efficacy of 31% at 3.5 years after vaccination, with a vaccine efficacy as high as 61% during the first year. 38,39 However, the findings were controversial because protection occurred despite lack of development of neutralizing antibodies or CD8 + cytotoxic T-cell responses. 38 Nonneutralizing IgG antibodies that targeted the HIV Env variable loops 1 and 2 (V1V2) were identified as correlates of protection, whereas high levels of Envspecific IgA antibodies were associated with a lack of protection. 40 The high cost of these human efficacy trials combined with the unanticipated results led the field to undertake a more nuanced study of the immunologic response to both vaccination and HIV-1 infection in vaccinees to extract more information from otherwise disappointing studies. These immunologic studies provided clues about which parts of the immune response might be contributing to vaccine-mediated protection. For example, sieve analysis of HIV-1einfected vaccine recipients identified which portions of the immune response appeared to be placing pressure on the virus, and these results have now begun to drive immunogen design. 41e43 Several ongoing efficacy trials are being conducted to better understand the results of the RV144 trial, including HVTN 702 and 705. The HVTN 702 study aims to enroll >5000 participants to assess the tolerability and immune response to ALVAC and bivalent subtype C gp120 adjuvanted with MF59 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02968849), and The HVTN 705 study (Imbokodo, Bloemfontein, South Africa) aims to assess a heterologous prime boost regimen using Ad26.Mos4.HIV and Clade C gp140 adjuvanted with aluminum phosphate (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03060629).",

To better elucidate this, researchers are evaluating the immunogenicity of SOSIPs with glycan holes filled. 78 Immunogenicity studies using soluble BG505 SOSIP.664 trimers have found successful bNAb production and neutralization of autologous tier 2 viruses in rabbits, 79 something not previously observed with Env-based immunogens. Currently, a Phase I clinical trial is under way to assess the tolerability and immunogenicity of BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 in healthy, HIV-1euninfected participants using a dose escalation strategy. The study is expected to close to accrual in 2020 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03699241).",

In addition, some bNAb characteristics suggest that a successful vaccine will need to overcome host immunoregulatory mechanisms that hinder formation of bNAbs, including, but not limited to, down selection of B-cells due to autoreactivity with host antigens. 105 B-cell lineage vaccine strategies re-create the coevolutionary events of the Env and the humoral response by priming the immune system with an early transmitted form of Env and boosting with sequentially evolved Env variants to drive affinity maturation and bNAb development to select for rare lineages. 59 The first of these designs was based on data from an HIV-1einfected individual, CH505, where the co-evolution of the virus and the CH103 CD4-binding site bNAb lineage was observed 106 ; this bNAb lineage neutralized 55% of tested HIV-1 isolates and had a lower level of somatic hypermutation compared with other bNAb lineages, making it an attractive vaccine target. The initial vaccine strategy used Env gp120 proteins that reacted most optimally with each step of the CH103 lineage (TF, week 53, week 78, and week 100). 106 This concept is currently being evaluated in HVTN115, a 2-part study designed to assess the tolerability and immunogenicity of the EnvSeq-1 vaccine (CH505TF, week 53, week 78, and week 100) adjuvanted with glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant formulated in a stable emulsion.

The study found that this combination was tolerable and resulted in increased CD8 + T-cell responses but decreased CD4 + responses. 128, 129 Nonreplicating Viral Vectorebased Vaccines Human Ad5 was used for some early viral vector vaccines, but the cellular and humoral immune responses to vaccine inserts were inhibited by preexisting neutralizing antibodies to the vector. 130 To overcome this challenge, researchers shifted to vectors based on other serotypes with lower seroprevalence, such as Ad26 and Ad35, 131 chimeric forms of adenovirus to prevent immune recognition (Ad5H3) using the antigen capsid-incorporation technique, 132 and the chimpanzee-adenovirus vector to which most humans have not been previously exposed. 133 In the antigen capsideincorporation strategy, chimeric Ad5H3 was created by adding a polyhistidine sequence (His 6 ) into the hexon3 (H3) capsid protein of Ad5. The resultant chimeric vector was fit and was not neutralized by Ad5 sera, suggesting its ability to overcome the problem of preexisting immunity. 132 The chimpanzee-adenovirus vector strategy has been similarly successful in inducing antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses for various pathogens, including Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Lassa fever, Ebola, and HIV-1. 134e136 There have now been several Phase I clinical trials using an Ad26, Ad35, or chimpanzeeadenovirus vector to deliver HIV-1 vaccines, but none using the chimeric vectors to date.",

Unlike other viral vectors, preexisting immunity does not appear to limit the immunogenicity of recombinant CMV vectors. 139 One prototype vaccine using a rhesus CMV vector induced durable SIVspecific effector CD8 + T-cell responses in rhesus macaques and provided aviremic control of infection after mucosal inoculation in 50% of the vaccinees for at least 52 weeks. 140, 141 Further analysis revealed that this vector stimulated a unique effector CD8 + Tcell response that recognized diverse epitopes, including those restricted by class II major histocompatibility complex molecules, and had significantly more breadth than that of traditional vaccines. 142 Because human CMV infection of pregnant women can be associated with birth defects, there are concerns about whether this strategy can be made tolerable for wide-scale deployment; thus, this strategy is not yet in human clinical trials.",

Mutations have been introduced into VRC01 to alter the amino acid sequence (M428L and N434S) of the constant region of the heavy chain to create VRC01-LS, a form that exhibits a 3fold longer half-life in serum, longer persistence in mucosal tissue, and 11-fold higher binding affinity to the neonatal Fc receptor without negatively affecting the effector function. 150,151 VRC01-LS was successfully evaluated in a Phase I clinical trial and found to be well tolerated via the subcutaneous and intravenous routes. In addition, because of the extended half-life, VRC01-LS could be administered less frequently than VRC01, making this a more feasible tool for HIV prevention. 152 Investigators have isolated several additional bNAbs, including, but not limited to, 3BNC117, 10e1074, and 10E8. 153e155 Multiple antibodies that target different epitopes on HIV-1 Env are likely going to be needed for any widely deployable passive immunotherapy program because, much like combination antiretroviral therapy is required to Clinical Therapeutics successfully suppress HIV-1, it has become clear that a single monoclonal antibody will likely not be sufficient to prevent infection. 156 Studies are assessing the safety and pharmacokinetic profiles of infusing combinations of bNAbs for the prevention of HIV-1 infection (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02824536) and the effects on viral loads in persons living with HIV-1 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT02825797 and NCT03526848). However, there are manufacturing and safety challenges that arise when bNAbs are physically combined, so researchers have also explored bispecific and trispecific antibody designs that have the ability to recognize and neutralize several antigenic targets concurrently. 157, 158 One group designed 4 bispecific antibodies, of which the combination of VRC07 (which targeted the CD4binding site) and PG9-16 (which targeted the V1V2 apex) was the most promising, with high potency and a neutralization breadth of 97% of all viruses tested. 157 More recently, a trispecific antibody VRC01/PGDM1400-10E8v4, which targeted the CD4-binding site, membrane-proximal external region, and the V1V2 glycan site, was engineered to explore whether these antibodies could effectively engage multiple effector targets via a 3:1 ratio (trispecific antibodyeprotein). Trispecific antibodies had higher breadth and potency and neutralized approximately 99% of viruses tested. 159 When evaluated in a rhesus macaque simian HIV challenge model, those animals infused with the trispecific antibodies were 100% protected, in contrast to the 25% protection rate seen with VRC01 alone. 159 In the coming years, we anticipate several additional trials in the antibody-mediated prevention family to test these concepts.",

Adenoassociated viruses are attractive candidates for this strategy because they are nonpathogenic, integrate into the host genome, and can infect both quiescent and dividing cells. 160, 161 Recombinant adenoassociated viruses have already been successfully used to deliver individual bNAbs that protected against repeated viral mucosal challenges in humanized mouse models. 162 Current work is focused on determining the best combination of bNAbs to counter escape mutations and preexisting resistance. As with other infectious diseases, such as diphtheria and hepatitis B where passive immunotherapy and active vaccination were combined to enhance protection, recombinant adenoassociated viruses and other passive therapies combined with active vaccination are likely to become important parts of a successful HIV vaccine strategy.",

We have learned that manipulating host controls of bNAb induction and displaying antigenic diversity to obtain neutralization breadth are all keys to developing a successful HIV-1 vaccine. One of the most substantial limitations to vaccine development is that we have not yet clearly defined the primary immune correlate(s) of protection against HIV-1 infection, although several potential correlates have been identified, including V1V2-specific IgG antibodies. 40 What we have learned thus far is that the successful vaccine candidate will likely use a heterologous prime-boost strategy that engages both the humoral and cellular immune systems to provide neutralization breadth or include nonneutralization protective immune responses and durability. Even then, such vaccines may be only one piece of a complex puzzle that may involve a combination of active and passive immunization tools.",
