Viral epidemics can be very disruptive to civil society, and-conversely-civil disasters can trigger viral epidemics. Furthermore, viruses likely play an insidious role in initiating a number of chronic diseases whose burden is ever increasing. Evolving technologies have led to much more rapid detection of viral diseases emerging anywhere in the world (Lipkin, 2013a,b) . However, current efforts to reduce the toll of viral diseases are less than satisfactory, and futurists predict the emergence of new pandemics particularly of zoonotic origin. Pathogenesis-the subject of this book-informs ongoing efforts to mitigate the toll of viral disease.",

Among major epidemics, some such as smallpox and influenza, are viral in origin. Less dramatic but perhaps more important are viral diseases of infancy and childhood. For instance, respiratory and diarrheal viral diseases among under-5-year-old children make a very significant contribution to the burden of human disease, and remain a major cause of short life expectancy in spite of the development of pediatric vaccines. As chronic diseases become more important, we are unraveling viral infections that are causal agents (such as oncogenic viruses) or are suspected to trigger immune-mediated illnesses (such as type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis).",

In Plagues and people, McNeill describes a number of episodes in which smallpox altered the course of history. Introduced into a \"virgin\" population, smallpox is devastating. Historic reconstructions have suggested that smallpox did not exist in the western hemisphere when the Spaniards first invaded Central America. They inadvertently transmitted smallpox to the large and well-organized Mayan and Aztec populations, triggering a decimating epidemic. It was smallpox that permitted a small contingent of 600 invaders to overcome an indigenous population of millions. Even during the twentieth century, when vaccination was widely practiced, it is estimated that 300-500 million people died from smallpox or at least 2 million souls each year.",

The virus is acquired by aerosol exposure, but spreads much less rapidly than many other viral infections since transmission usually occurs via face-to-face contact. Following infection, the incubation period is 10-20 days. Inhaled virus replicates first in the lungs, then spreads to internal organs causing a viremia and widespread dissemination. The virus replicates in skin and small dermal blood vessels, causing a rash that evolves into multiple blisters, which leave severe scars on the face and body; corneal infection may cause permanent blindness. Two different strains of variola virus circulated in humans, variola major with a mortality of 20-30% and variola minor, with a mortality of about 1%. The exact cause of death during smallpox infection is a bit murky, and has been attributed to \"toxemia,\" that is an overwhelming infection of lungs and many other organs.",

            "text": "The concept of immunization against viral diseases originated with variolation, the deliberate exposure to (hopefully) small doses of virulent variola virus, a method fraught with danger. Immunization was markedly improved by the observation that vaccinia virus, a poxvirus that infected cows, produced a mild localized infection on the hands of milkmaids, who were protected against smallpox. Dr Edward Jenner, who suggested the use of vaccinia-based immunization in 1796, was first an object of derision by the medical profession ( Figure 2 ), but is now regarded as a pioneer in preventive medicine. Vaccination is very effective, producing a high level of protection against illness and death that probably lasts a lifetime, although the degree of immunity can wane after 5-10 years. Widespread vaccination eradicated smallpox from many countries in the second half of the twentieth century, but outbreaks continued to occur in lower income countries where many children were not immunized. Based on successful eradication of smallpox in many countries, the World Health Organization embarked on a program of global eradication in 1966. Smallpox possessed a number of attributes that made it a feasible target for eradication: it was an infection exclusive to humans, with no vector or extrahuman reservoir; all acute infections were readily detected due to the unmistakable pustular rash and there were no subclinical infections; transmission was mainly confined to direct face-to-face contact between patients and susceptible persons; the incubation period was rather long, so that outbreaks spread slowly; and it was easy to identify immune individuals who had prominent scars due to prior infection or vaccination. A key to control was the strategy of \"ring vaccination\" around individual outbreaks, which was more effective than population-wide immunization of children and adults. Due to heroic efforts in India and a number of other countries with limited public health programs, smallpox was eradicated by 1977, and the world declared smallpox-free in 1980 (Henderson, 2009; Foege, 2011) . In spite of the outstanding record of viral vaccines as effective public health tools, even today there remain a small group of nonbelievers.",

Currently, it is estimated that if a person aged 20 is diagnosed with a recent HIV infection and if he or she has access to optimal treatment, her/his life expectancy is about 50 years (in contrast to 5 years if untreated). The dramatic impact of antiretroviral drugs has the potential to convert a fatal infection into a chronic manageable illness.

In Africa, the locus of about 75% of the global burden of HIV/AIDS, few countries have optimal HIV control programs. A significant impediment is the price of antiretroviral drugs, although this barrier has been substantially reduced. More important, few African countries have a health system that is sufficiently robust to provide adequate diagnosis and treatment for the whole population. A reduction in the incidence of new infections is likely the best measure for the success of an HIV control program (the reproductive rate, Ro, is less than 1). HIV incidence remains very high in the more heavily impacted countries, even though some have managed to somewhat reduce the year-on-year number of new infections. (It should be noted that a reduction in new infections has not been accomplished in the United States either, where new infections have plateaued for at least 20 years.)",

Influenza virions carry two external spikes, the hemagglutinin (H) and the neuraminidase (N); the hemagglutinin spike is responsible for attachment to the cellular receptor. The receptor is a sialic acid residue on cell surface proteins many of which are glycosylated. Importantly, sialic acid residues on human glycoproteins mainly have \u03b12-6 linkages (the number two carbon on the sialic acid hexose ring is linked to the number six carbon on the galactose ring within the glycosyl moiety on the glycoprotein) while sialic acid residues on avian glycoproteins are mainly attached via \u03b12-3 linkages. This has epidemiological implications because avian-derived type A influenza viruses preferentially attach to \u03b12-3 linkages while type A influenza viruses that spread in humans preferentially attach to \u03b12-6 linked sialic acid residues. Importantly, a few mutations on the viral hemagglutinin can change the sialic acid preference for the virus. There are many strains of type A influenza virus, and different strains circulate in different vertebrate species. Type A influenza virus strains are classified into subtypes by the antigenic determinants on the H and N spikes, which assort independently within the segmented viral genome. Thus, there are H1N1 subtypes, H1N2 subtypes, and so forth.",

This pandemic represented the largest single epidemic in recorded medical history, an unprecedented human catastrophe, which caused a transient drop in global life expectancy, an unprecedented phenomenon. Figure 4 shows a ward of influenza patients during this global pandemic. Recent studies have reconstructed the genome of the 1918 virus from genetic fragments found in exhumed tissues of persons dying during the epidemic. The pandemic strain had an H1N1 phenotype, an antigenic pattern to which the human population was nonimmune since viruses of this type had not been prevalent in the human population for an estimated 35 years prior to the epidemic. Studies with the reconstructed virus in nonhuman primates have recapitulated the acute disease seen in humans. Diseases severity was associated with an extreme cytokine storm centered in the lungs, in contrast to the alternative theory that the virus had spread widely to many other tissues. Furthermore, studies with viral recombinants identified several viral genes (other than H and N determinants) that were associated with virulence.

Many of these concepts are developed in later chapters and are summarized in Sidebar 1. There are a multitude of viral infections of humans, but most of them are relatively innocuous and cause mild transient infections (for instance, rhinoviruses, one cause of the \"common cold\"). However, a few viruses cause major morbidity and mortality. In some instances, such as those viruses that are transmitted by aerosol, disease symptoms (such as coughing and sneezing) play a critical role in transmission, but in many other instances (for instance, many clinically silent enteric infections such as that caused by poliovirus) spread is unrelated to disease causation. Thus, there is no necessary relationship between the disease caused by a virus and its ability to perpetuate itself in the human population. A good example is the contrast between the two variants of smallpox virus both of which were maintained in human populations; variola major carried a 20-30% case fatality ratio while variola minor killed only 1% of its victims. Some viruses cause acute infections while others persist. Among both groups, there are instances of serious disease. Smallpox, rabies, and polio viruses cause acute infections, while HIV, human papilloma, and Kaposi's sarcoma viruses cause persistent infections. It is noteworthy that the severity of disease caused by a given virus is determined in part by the individual human host. As an extreme example of human genetic determinants, individuals who are homozygous for the delta 32 deletion (for expression of the CCR5 protein) are resistant to infection with HIV, and there are many other human genetic determinants that influence the course of HIV infection. The age of infected individuals can also have a dramatic influence on the course of infection with a specific virus. During the epidemic of measles in a \"virgin\" population in the Faroe Islands in 1846, measles had a fatality ratio of 20% in infants, 10% in the elderly, but only 1% in young adults.",

As example, life expectancy in the United States was about 47 years in 1900 but is now close to 80 years, a change greater than that seen in all of recorded history. Congruent with this, there are now safe and effective vaccines against more than 15 individual virus diseases of humans. This has led to a dramatic reduction in child mortality, which in turn has made an important contribution to the increase in life expectancy. Another example is antiretroviral therapy for young adults infected with HIV, which has increased life expectancy to an estimated 50 years compared to an average 5 years prior to treatment. However, balanced against these triumphs of medical science, there still exist some outstanding current failures. Here are two examples. First, underutilization of both vaccines and antiviral drugs remains a major challenge in developing countries. It has already been noted that an estimated 150,000 unvaccinated children die unnecessarily of measles each year. HIV/AIDS is even a more serious problem. On a global level, there are still more than two million new human infections with HIV annually. And in the United States, the annual number of new HIV infections (estimated 60,000) has not dropped in the last 20 years. Second, the lack of an HIV vaccine. More than 30 after the isolation of HIV, progress toward an effective HIV vaccine is still very slow and research has yet to solve some daunting scientific challenges that impede vaccine development.",

Events of the last 50 years justify some predictions, although the specifics remain hazy (Sidebar 2). In recent decades, a considerable number of new viral diseases of humans have emerged ( Figure 1 ). Of these, the most significant are HIV/AIDS, influenza, and SARS. All of these viruses share three properties: they are zoonotic infections, transmitted from animals to humans; they produce a high level of morbidity and mortality in their human hosts; and they have adapted to spread directly from human to human. Zoonotic infections such as Sin Nombre, Ebola, Marberg, Nipah, and Hendra viruses are also highly virulent, but they have limited ability to spread from human to human; therefore, they have caused small outbreaks albeit with high mortality.",

In 2009, a novel H1N1 type A influenza virus of swine origin crossed into humans and caused a worldwide epidemic, which was estimated to have infected over 100 million people in over 200 countries, with at least 20,000 confirmed deaths. Genetic analysis of this virus showed that it contained individual genes from four different sources, avian, human, and two swine influenza virus lineages. The critical genes for the H and N proteins were derived from the 1918 pandemic strain which had persisted in pigs since that time. Although this virus was much less virulent than the 1918 influenza virus, it demonstrated the potential for recombination as a source of new influenza viruses with the ability to spread rapidly in the human population.",

Alternatively, an H5N1 avian virus, with four point mutations that changed its receptor preference from avian-like to human-like, was passaged in ferrets and ultimately acquired the ability to spread between experimental animals by aerosol; however, the evolved laboratory strain was not highly pathogenic in ferrets.
