This report is a detailed analysis of trends and current conditions in research and development in the Czech Republic with comprehensive statistical data and a comparison with other countries. In January 2002, the government adopted Resolution No. 16, thereby adopting the National Research and Development Policy of the Czech Republic. A fundamental policy statement is included, and the intent is for the policy to be updated in approximately 2 years. This document is based on a preliminary assessment in 1999 and is divided into nine parts covering OECD statistics, state expenditures, type of data, patents, R&D sectors, overall economic performance, and more. Part II is also available online hhttp:// www.msmt.cz/Files/VedaAVyzkum/Legislativa/msmt _ an _ 2.pdfi, and the accompanying complete analysis of statistics for this report is available online from this Ministry, hhttp:// www.msmt.cz/i. This study is the end-product of a major Northern European environmental cooperation project, with the editorial team based at the Nature Division, Finnish Environment Institute, Ministry of the Environment, and the study financed and published by the Nordic Council of Ministers. Written for a general audience, this study provides detailed scientific information about plant and animals species and their habitats, examines the significance of biological diversity, and reviews the natural history of Northern Europe. In addition, it assesses the need for nature conservation by examining in detail how people have shaped plant and animal communities and their habitats and how nature is faring today under various pressures. The book provides critical arguments on how the diversity of our natural surroundings could and should be protected. The Finnish Environment Institute also has a list of online electronic titles available at no charge and downloadable in PDF format at hhttp://www.vyh.fi/eng/ orginfo/publica/electro/electro.htmi. This final report, arranged into three main parts, recommends that the solutions for the labor shortage and unemployment problems support each other. The background of the problem is the point of time when the baby boom generation starts leaving the labor market, and labor shortage will be more acute. It points out the need for new labor, options to activate and increase the labor pool, and the costs of these measures. The interim report of the project was Labour Administration Publication No. 290 on September 3, 2002. The English version of the final report includes the analytical section in its entirety, but detailed country-specific observations are included in Finnish at the ministry's Web site at hhttp://www.mol.fi/i. In three parts, this study examines the quality and transitions in working life in Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. Local people from each country were surveyed and the results included, with illustrations, statistical tables, and the original questionnaires. Part 1 provides essays written by local experts on the conditions of working life for each country. Part 2 is the working life barometer of nine identified themes from the results of the survey, ranging from working life conditions, stresses, and wages to job satisfaction, use of Internet on the job, and job training. Current trends and future expectations for each country are summarized in the third part. Within the context of the agricultural food industry being the foremost industrial sector in France and the importance of this industry in the European market, this study analyzes the costs of the quality and security of food. Commissioned by the Ministry (DPEI), this report includes a study by CETEN APAVE International concerning environmental certification of food stuffs marketing within the agricultural industry of France, and compares the quality and security of the food to the conditions in other countries such as the United Kingdom. Statistical and budgetary analysis for certification is included. Arranged into three parts, Part 1 includes a summary and a bibliography. Part 3 provides a qualitative and quantitative analysis, with some information from questionnaires. Part 3 includes the recommendations for the international agricultural market in France with case studies of Britain and Italy. This study covers the background of enlargement of member nations of the European Union and focuses on its effect on consumers and the financial market in Europe-with special sector studies on specific industries. It investigates five specific areas of integration: regional, agricultural, environmental, structural, and monetary. In addition, it includes analysis of the transition challenges for Central and Eastern European member nations. The official German language gateway to federal agencies and administrative bodies throughout Germany, this site includes research institutes, cultural organizations, and social service agencies as well as government bodies as well as links to federal states. All federal institutions complete with an Internet address are scheduled to be included by 2005, and this program plan is called BundOnline 2005.

With bibliography, introduction, and summary hhttp://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/department/i This paper was published as a result of the Action Programme for the Millennium, which committed the Irish government to examine the issues involved with introducing a basic income payment and the work of a Steering Group on Basic Income, reporting its study in 2001. This study involved replacing the existing social welfare and income tax systems with a universal payment to all adults, a flat rate of income tax, and a social solidarity fund to compensate low-income people. The objectives of this green paper are to facilitate and encourage further debate and discussion by a further examination of the implications of the introduction of a basic income system in Ireland. It also discusses a possible framework for the development of a basic income system, with alternative policy options, and provides background for the discussion and a history of the basic income concept for Ireland. There are links to the full text of the three study reports commissioned by the Steering Group as well as its overview report (2001) , which are also available on the Department of the Taoiseach Web site, and the parameters used in the studies. Furthermore, it assesses the possible impact of a basic income approach in Ireland. Summary and conclusions complete the green paper. The key findings of the Steering Group on Social and Equality Statistics during the period April-November 2002 are reported in this study. The group's charge was to study what was needed to be done to develop Irish social and equality statistics to meet current and pending needs and to identify the specific data needs to build social statistics that more efficiently support the policy needs of decision-makers. Twelve recommendations are made, especially in reference to the Central Statistics Office and the National Statistics Board, which describe a larger vision for social statistics in a national framework. The report recommends that a formal data/statistics strategy be devised within each department and more standardization used in coordination and classifying data collection and maintenance. Availability of the data on the Internet in a user-friendly form is also a recommendation. In 2001, the electorate gave Fianna F\u00e1\u00efl and the Progressive Democrats a renewed and enhanced mandate for government based on a specific 5-year agenda. This is the government's account of its progress in detail in international affairs (relations with the European Union), social reform (sustaining progress), peace in Northern Ireland, finances, and the economy. Other major government reports related to these issues are also available in full text at the Department of the Taoiseach This national ICT policy has been approved by the Council of Ministers of the government of Mozambique on June 27, 2002. It covers the short-, medium-, and long-term national objectives to improve national information communication technology with the aim to improve economic performance and sustainable development. Specific recommendations include creating an electronic network for the government that raises its efficiency and to improve the Internet service in the country. Details pertaining to the ICT implementation strategy and how it will support the government's Action Programme for the Reduction of Absolute Poverty (PARPA), contribute to reducing illiteracy, improve governance, provide access to information, and raise the efficiency of private and public services are also included. Equipment Act is included, along with a summary of the provisions of the Act. Statistical tables include a breakdown of the type of military equipment exported and the country of destination.
