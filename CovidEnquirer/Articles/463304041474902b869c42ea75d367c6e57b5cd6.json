            "text": "This study reviewed 1787 episodes of peritoneal dialysis (PD)-related peritonitis in 544 patients between 1994 and 2003. The overall rate of peritonitis was 0.68 episodes \u2044 year of PD, but decreased from 1.10 to 0.46 episodes \u2044 year between 1994 and 2003. The incidence of peritonitis caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci declined between 1994 and 1998 from 0.21 to 0.06 episodes \u2044 year of PD, coinciding with a reduction in the use of spike PD sets. There was a 60.1% response rate to antibiotics throughout the period, but the percentage of cases that required modification of the initial empirical antibiotic regimen rose from 13.6% to 58.7%, indicating that treatment should be individualised. Peritonitis is the most important cause of treatment failure in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients [1] . Peritonitis was common following the initial development of PD, but the incidence has decreased markedly during the past 15 years, probably as a result of improvements in connection technology [2, 3] . Peritonitis rates nowadays are less than one episode \u2044 20 patient-months in most series [4, 5] . The present study describes the change in distribution of causative organisms in PD-related peritonitis during a 10-year period in a single centre in Hong Kong.",

A diagnosis of peritonitis was based on at least two of the following criteria [6] : (1) abdominal pain or cloudy peritoneal dialysis effluent (PDE); (2) leukocytosis in PDE (white blood cells > 100 \u2044 mL); and (3) positive Gram-stain or culture from PDE. Episodes with peritoneal eosinophilia but with a negative bacterial culture were excluded. Bacterial culture of PDE was performed throughout the period in BacTAlert bottles (Organon Teknika, Durham, NC, USA), according to the recommendations of the International Society of Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) [7] . Isolation and identification of bacteria, as well as determination of antibiotic sensitivities, were performed according to the ISPD guidelines [7] .",

A gradual reduction in the rate of peritonitis was observed during the 10-year period, from 1.10 episodes \u2044 year of PD in 1994 to 0.46 episodes \u2044 year of PD in 2003.

            "text": "There was a progressive reduction in the use of spike sets for PD between 1994 and 1998, which paralleled the decline in Gram-positive peritonitis. The average rate of response to antibiotic therapy was 60.1%, while 199 episodes (11.1%) required catheter removal. A combination of cefazolin and ceftazidime, the regimen recommended by the current guidelines of the ISPD [7] , yielded a response rate of 66.9%. The rate of response to antibiotic therapy remained static during the 10-year period (details not shown); however, the percentage of cases that required an alteration in the antibiotic regimen rose from 13.6% in 1994 to 58.7% in 2003. The present study found that the overall incidence of PD-related peritonitis decreased by more than half during the 10-year study period. When specific organisms were examined, the incidence of peritonitis caused by CNS decreased by about 75%, while the incidence of that caused by S. aureus was halved. This declining incidence of Gram-positive peritonitis was not an unexpected finding. It is agreed generally that the incidence of peritonitis decreased markedly as a result of improvements in connection technology [2, 3] . Almost all patients in the present series have used a disconnect system since 1998, and the incidence of Gram-positive peritonitis remained at a low but static level between 1998 and 2002, further supporting the role of the disconnect system. Interestingly, the incidence of Grampositive peritonitis showed a further significant decrease in 2003. The precise reason for this further decrease remains unknown, but it may have resulted from the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong, which reinforced the personal hygiene and aseptic precautions taken with these patients. Attention to such precautions has been proved to reduce the rate of infection in PD patients [15] .",
