Two types of recombinant porcine 36 EV-Gs carrying papain-like cysteine protease (PLCP) gene of porcine torovirus, a virus in 37 Coronaviridae, are reported. Type 1 recombinant EV-Gs are detected in pig feces in Japan, USA, 38 and Belgium and carry the PLPC gene at the junction site of 2C/3A genes, while PLPC gene 39 replaces the viral structural genes in type 2 recombinant EV-G detected in pig feces in a Chinese 40 farm. We identified a novel type 2 recombinant EV-G carrying the PLCP gene with flanking 41 sequences in place of the viral structural genes in pig feces in Japan. The ~0.3 kb-long upstream 42 flanking sequence had no sequence homology with any proteins deposited in GenBank, while the 43 downstream ~0.9 kb-long flanking sequence included a domain having high amino acid sequence 44 homology with a baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat superfamily. The pig feces, where the 45 novel type 2 recombinant EV-G was detected, also carried type 1 recombinant EV-G. Although the 46 phylogenetic analysis suggested that these two recombinant EV-Gs have independently evolved, 47 type 1 recombinant EV-G might have served as a helper virus by providing viral structural proteins 48 for dissemination of the type 2 recombinant EV-G. 49 50",

This fecal sample also contains type 1 recombinant 108 EV-G (EVG/Porcine/JPN/MoI2-1-1/2015/G1-Type 1) [4]. In contrast to the reported type 2 109 recombinant EV-G genome in China, which carries the PLCP gene of pig torovirus in place of viral 110 structural genes [8], the newly identified type 2 recombinant EV-G (EVG/Porcine/JPN/MoI2-1-",

The new type 2 recombinant EV-G genome carried a 119 single ORF, suggesting that translation of the viral polyprotein starts at the translational start 120 codon (ATG) at the 5' end of the unique region 1 and ends at the stop codon (TAA) of 3D gene. In 121 addition to the replacement of the structural genes with the PLCP gene carrying flanking regions, 122 the newly identified type 2 recombinant EV-G lacked 11 amino acids at the N-terminal of 2A 123 protein. We noted that the same 11 amino acids are also deleted in type 2 recombinant EV-G 124 detected in the pig farm in China [8]. In contrast, the N-terminal truncation of the 2A proteinase 125 gene did not occur in type 1 recombinant and non-recombinant EV-Gs (data not shown), implying 126 that the truncated 2A may be a specific characteristic feature among type 2 recombinant EV-Gs. 127 Furthermore, type 2 recombinant EV-Gs lacked GxCG motif in 2A, which is considered to form part 128 of the active site of the protease and is conserved among enteroviruses [14]. In contrast all type 1 129 recombinant EV-Gs carry this motif in 2A (data not shown). Fig. 1C showed amino acid sequences 130 at the junction sites of the unique region 1, PLCP gene, unique region 2, and the 2A lacking the N-131 terminal 11 amino acids [14]. 132 133 Unique regions of type 2 recombinant EV-G 134 An internal region (amino acids 180-240) of the 304 amino acid-long unique region 2 of the 135 newly identified type 2 recombinant EV-G showed high amino acid homology with genes of 136 baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat (BIR) superfamily(Fig. 2).

These data suggest that the type 2 recombinant EV-G was not 146 directly derived from known type 1 recombinant EV-Gs or non-recombinant EV-Gs. We also noted 147 that the new type 2 recombinant EV-G had the 247 nt-long 3' UTR (data not shown), which was 148 substantially longer than 40 to 165 nt-long 3' UTR of most of picornaviruses, supporting the notion 149 that the new type 2 recombinant EV-G has evolved independently from type 1 recombinant EV-Gs Discussion 153 In the present study, we reported the genome of a novel type 2 recombinant EV-G from pig 154 feces in Japan.
