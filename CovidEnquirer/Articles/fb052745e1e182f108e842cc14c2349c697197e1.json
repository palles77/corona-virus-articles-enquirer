In this study, two new venom peptides from the scorpion Heterometrus petersii were identified with effective inhibitory effect on HSV-1 infection in vitro. Both Hp1036 and Hp1239 peptides exhibited potent virucidal activities against HSV-1 (EC 50 = 0.43 \u00b1 0.09 and 0.41 \u00b1 0.06 lM, respectively) and effective inhibitory effects when added at the viral attachment (EC 50 = 2.87 \u00b1 0.16 and 5.73 \u00b1 0.61 lM, respectively), entry (EC 50 = 4.29 \u00b1 0.35 and 4.32 \u00b1 0.47 lM, respectively) and postentry (EC 50 = 7.86 \u00b1 0.80 and 8.41 \u00b1 0.73 lM, respectively) steps. Both Hp1036 and Hp1239 peptides adopted a-helix structure in approximate membrane environment and resulted in the destruction of the viral morphology. Moreover, Hp1036 and Hp1239 peptides entered Vero cells and reduced the intracellular viral infectivity. Taken together, Hp1036 and Hp1239 peptides are two anti-viral peptides with effective inhibitory effect on multiple steps of HSV-1 life cycle and therefore are good candidate for development as virucides.",

After an initial infection, HSV-1 spreads to the nervous system and establishes latent infection of neurons in sensory ganglia of the host (Hill et al., 1996) . Approximately 80% of the world populations are carriers of HSV-1 and about 40% suffer from recurrent infection (Gold and Corey, 1987; Palem et al., 2011) . Current therapeutic drugs against HSV infection are nucleotides, nucleosides or pyrophosphate analogues, such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, penciclovir and famciclovir (Hsiang and Ho, 2008) . After uptake by virus-infected cells, these drugs are activated by the viral thymidine kinase and inhibit the viral DNA polymerase. However, HSV infection remains a serious challenge because of the viral resistance and side effect (Crute et al., 2002; Field, 2001) . Therefore, the development of new safe and effective anti-HSV molecules is urgently needed.",

            "text": "Many antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been shown to have inhibitory activities against HSV infection. According to the structure characteristics, these peptides are classified into five types: a-helix, b-sheet, cyclic b-sheet, b-turn and extended (Jenssen et al., 2006) . Proposed anti-viral mechanism of a-helix mainly includes cellular target and viral inactivation, including Magainin, Cecropin, Mellitin, LL-37 and Brevinin-1 (Aboudy et al., 1994; Albiol Matanic and Castilla, 2004; Yasin et al., 2000) . Two kinds of b-sheet peptides, human and rabbit defensins, were shown to interact with HSV membrane/glycoprotein and cellular targets but not heparan sulfate (Sinha et al., 2003; Yasin et al., 2004) . Another b-sheet peptide from frog, dermaseptin, was shown to have potent inhibitory effect when applied to the virus before or during virus adsorption to the target cells (Belaid et al., 2002) . Two b-sheet peptides tachyplesin and protegrin were proved to have viral inactivating effect (Yasin et al., 2000) . Cyclic b-sheet peptides such as h-defensin was shown to bound to gB protein and blocked HSV-1 attachment (Yasin et al., 2004) . The b-turn peptides lactoferrin (LF) and lactoferricin (Lfcin) are antimicrobial peptides that were found to block HSV entry into Vero cells. LF had no effect against HSV after the virus had entered the cells, while Lfcin exerted anti-viral activity also after the initial binding of the virus to the host cells Jenssen et al., 2004 ). An extended peptide from bovine, indolicidin, showed a direct inactivation effect on cell-free HSV-1 virons by targeting viral membrane/ glycoprotein (Albiol Matanic and Castilla, 2004 Natural AMPs from scorpion venoms have attracted much attention due to their anti-viral bioactivities. Some of them have been identified as anti-enveloped virus agents in our previous works. The peptide mucroporin-M1 was shown to be virucidal against the measles, SARS-CoV and influenza H5N1 viruses, and it inhibited HBV replication in vitro and in vivo Zhao et al., 2012) . A natural a-helical peptide, Hp1090, was proven to have the property of killing HCV . Two histidine rich peptides were designed on the molecular template of a short virucidal peptide Ctry2459 and were confirmed to have enhanced bioavailability, which resulted in potent inhibitory effect on HCV proliferation (Hong et al., 2013) . Another mutational peptide, Kn2-7, was also effective in inhibiting HIV-1 infection (Chen et al., 2012) . These studies indicated that scorpion venom is a rich source of anti-viral peptides. In the present study, we screened and identified two peptides from the venom of scorpion Heterometrus petersii, which exhibited effective inhibitory effect on HSV-1 infection.",

Previously, we designed two histidine rich peptides with enhanced cellular uptake and advanced intracellular distribution, which resulted in potent anti-viral activities against HCV (Hong et al., 2013) . While in the present study, we found two natural peptides with the same properties and anti-viral functions, indicating the diversity of biomolecules from scorpion venom.",

For more than two decades, anti-viral drugs targeting to the viral DNA polymerase such as acyclovir (ACV) have been widely used for the treatment of HSV infection. Unfortunately, the extensive clinical use of these drugs has led to the emergence of drug-resistant viral strains. (Greco et al., 2007; Krawczyk et al., 2013) Using the virucidal peptides such as Hp1036 and Hp1239 for the treatment of HSV infection, the generation of drug-resistant virus variants is likely to be reduced.",

In this way, the virucidal molecules may act as a potential member to participate the therapeutic alliance, with its unique anti-viral pattern. In brief, this kind of membrane-targeting peptides could be combined with drugs that target intracellular components of the viral life cycle. Thus, a virucidal peptide used in combination with protease and/or polymerase inhibitors targeting multiple steps of viral infection cycle would have advantages over single drug therapy in reducing viral titers as well as in suppressing the emergence of viral resistance (Liu et al., 2010) .",

The screened peptides Hp1036 and Hp1239 not only exhibited extracellular virucidal activities against HSV-1, but also had potent inhibitory effect when added at the viral attachment and entry steps. The virucidal activities depended on the morphological changes of HSV-1 virons by the treatment of Hp1036 and Hp1239. Their properties of amphipathic a-helix conformation under appropriate membrane environment possibly contributed to their membrane penetrating and virucidal activities, resulting in the intracellular anti-viral effect. Hp1036 and Hp1239 easily entered Vero cells. Naturally, both peptides also inactivated intracellular viral particles and inhibited viral proliferation at the postinfection step. Our work provided a new direction of developing potential biofunctional molecules from animal venoms and opened new avenues for discovering anti-viral agents or sources.",
