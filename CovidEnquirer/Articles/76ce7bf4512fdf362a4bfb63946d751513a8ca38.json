In the present study, we analyzed the S glycoprotein gene to characterize 10 winter dysentery (WD) coronavirus strains circulated in Korea during 2002-2003 and compared the nucleotide (nt) and deduced amino acid (aa) sequences with the other known BCoV. The phylogenetic analysis of the entire S glycoprotein gene revealed that the aa sequences of all Korean WD strains were more homologous to each other and were very closely related to respiratory bovine coronavirus (RBCV) strain OK and enteric bovine coronavirus (EBCV) strain LY-138, but were distinct from the other known BCoVs. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the hypervariable region of the S1 subunit, all Korean WD strains clustered with the respiratory strain OK, BCQ3994 and the enteric strain LY-138, while the Canadian BCQ calf diarrhea and WD strains, and the American RBCV LSU, French EBCV F15 and avirulent VACC, L9, and Mebus strains clustered on a separate major branch. These data suggest that the WD strains circulated in Korea had a genetic property of both RBCV and EBCV and were significantly distinct from the ancestral enteric strain.",

RNA was extracted from the supernatant fluids of HRT-18G cells infected with 10 KWD strains, based on the acid quanidinium-phenol-chloroform RNA extraction method as described by Cho et al. (2001a) . As a negative control, RNA was extracted from mock-infected HRT-18G cells. The oligonucleotide primers used in the RT-PCR were designed from the published sequence of the S gene of the Mebus strain (GenBank accession no. U00735). The sequence of primers (positions calculated from the start codon of the S gene) are as follows: 1st upstream primer, 5 -ATGTTTTTGATACTTTTAATTTCC-3 (1-24); 1st downstream primer, 5 -ACACCAGTAGATGGTGCTAT-3 (901-920); 2nd upstream primer, 5 -GGGTTACACCTCT-CACTTCT-3 (782-801); 2nd downstream primer, 5 -GCAGGACAAGTGCCTATACC-3 (1531-1550); 3rd upstream primer, 5 -CTGTCCGTGTAAATTGGATG-3 (1459-1478); 3rd downstream primer, 5 -TGTAGAGTAATC-CACACGT-3 (2268-2286); 4th upstream primer, 5 -TTC ACGACAGCTGCAACCTA-3 (2151-2170); 4th downstream primer, 5 -CCATGGTAACACCAATCC CA-3 (3003-3022); 5th upstream primer, 5 -CCCTGT-ATTAGGTTGTTTAG-3 (2691-2710); 5th downstream primer, 5 -ACCACTACCAGTGAACATCC-3 (3587-3606); 6th upstream primer, 5 -GTGCAGAATGCT-CCATATGGT-3 (3439-3459); 6th downstream primer, 5 -TTAGTCGTCATGTGATGTTT-3 (4073-4092). A one-step RT-PCR assay was performed as described by Cho et al. (2001a,b) . The RT-PCR products were purified using a GenClean II kit (BIO 101, Inc., LaJolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA sequencing was done using an automated DNA sequencer (ABI system 3700, Applied Biosystem Inc., Foster City, CA).",

These polymorphisms led to 46 and 24 aa changes at 41 and 20 distinct sites, respectively. We have shown recently that the respiratory and enteric isolates collected concurrently from two different calves in USA were significantly distinct from the ancestral enteric strain, Mebus (Hasoksuz et al., 2002) . By drawing comparisons of deduced aa between our strains and other known BCoV, the two most similar sequences were those of KWD10 strain and RBCV LSU strain (96.6%) in paired comparisons, and the most distant were those of the KWD5 strain and the Mebus strain (93.4%).

The aa sequences of 10 KWD strains were more homologous to each other and were very closely related to the virulent RBCV OK and EBCV LY-138 strains, among the other known BCoV studied in paired comparisons (Fig. 1) . These data showed that the WD BCoVs circulated in Korea were genetically similar to both RBCV and EBCV. In addition, the phylogenetic comparison of Korean WD strains with other known BCoVs, on the sequences of the hypervariable region, revealed that all Korean WD strains were also clustered in groups with the virulent RBCV OK and BCQ3994 strains, and the virulent EBCV LY-139 strain (Fig. 2) . The Canadian BCQ CD and WD strains, the American RBCV LSU strain, French EBCV F15 strain and avirulent VACC, L9 and Mebus strains were clustered on a separate major branch (Fig. 2) . Therefore, these results indicated that the BCoV strains may be diverging from an enteric tropism to a dual (respiratory and Rekik and Dea, 1994) of respiratory (RBCV), enteric (EBCV), calf diarrhea (CD), winter dysentery (WD), and avirulent strains.

This speculation could be supported by our previous paper (Cho et al., 2001a) in which gnotobiotic and colostrumdeprived calves were inoculated with respiratory isolates of BCoV shed viruses, both nasally and rectally. This subsequently induced diarrhea. Moreover, feedlot cattle, which had shown respiratory disease signs at arrival time, developed diarrhea 4 days after arrival, which peaked at 4-7 days post arrival (Cho et al., 2001b) . Further study will be needed on the differences in pathogenicity, antigenicity, or any other physicochemical characteristics between the KWD strains.",

In particular, aa 744, reporting its sequence in many isolates and/or strains, are the same as other known BCoV including RBCV, CD, WD, and EBCV.

In the present study, the aa sequences of the S2 subunit of Korean WD strains were comparatively well conserved compared with the S1 subunit of the Mebus strain. The notable aa changes were observed only in the first hydrophobic region of all KWD strains. In this region, there were four aa substitutions (aa 959, 965, 984, and 988), resulting in a marked increase of hydrophilicity in comparison with that of the Mebus strain (data not shown). Interestingly, the other known virulent BCoV, including RBCV LSU and OK strains, EBCV LY and F15 strains revealed an increase in hydrophilicity in the first hydrophobic region compared with avirulent strains Vacc, L9, and Mebus (data not shown). The membrane fusion activity is most likely conferred by the internal hydrophobic sequences within the S2 subunit (Luo and Weiss, 1998; Yoo et al., 1991) . Therefore, aa substitutions inducing an increase in hydrophilicity observed in our strains and other virulent BCoV may alter the fusion activity or pathogenicity of the viruses.",

In the present study, the S glycoprotein of all KWD strains contained seven aa substitutions (aa 33, 40, 248, 470, 965, 1241, and 1341) which were common for all virulent strains (Fig. 3) . This is in agreement with Chouljenko et al. (1998) , who identified seven virulent-specific aa changes in the S gene by comparison with the RBCV, EBCV, and vaccine strains. Since these virulent-specific sites were observed in all virulent BCoV, but not in avirulent BCoV, these aa changes may affect the structure and function of the S glycoprotein and alter the pathogenetic potential of these viruses (Chouljenko et al., 1998; Zhang et al., 1991) .",
