In this study, we demonstrated that cellular DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX5 plays an important role in JEV replication. The knockdown of DDX5 was able to decrease JEV replication, and overexpression of DDX5 mutants lacking the helicase activity also reduced JEV replication, suggesting the helicase activity is essential for JEV replication. DDX5 knockdown did not affect virus assembly and release. GST-pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that DDX5 could interact with JEV core protein, non-structural protein 3 (NS3) and 5 (NS5-MTase and NS5-RdRp domains). Meanwhile, we also confirmed that DDX5 interacts with these viral proteins during JEV infection. Confocal microscopy analysis showed that endogenous DDX5 is recruited to the cytoplasm and colocalizes with these viral proteins and viral RNA. RNA-pulldown experiment showed that DDX5 only binds to the JEV 3 0 untranslated region (UTR). Finally, we confirmed the role of DDX5 in JEV RNA replication using JEV-replicon system. In conclusion, we identified DDX5 as a positive regulator for JEV replication.",

DDX5 interacts with SARS-CoV helicase and SARS-CoV replication is significantly inhibited when expression of DDX5 was silenced by small interfering RNA (Chen et al., 2009) . DDX5 also colocalizes with influenza virus RNP in the nucleus and interacts with influenza virus polymerase (Bortz et al., 2011) . HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase can interact with DDX5 and transient expression of RdRp causes the redistribution of endogenous DDX5 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Goh et al., 2004) .",

BHK-21 cells were transfected with different MYC-tagged viral protein plasmid, MYC-tagged viral protein was used to immunoprecipitate the endogenous DDX5 protein from the cell lysates treated with RNase (100 lg/ml) and DNase (100 lg/ml). The cell lysates (input, 2%) were analyzed in parallel by Western blot. Asterisks represent the nonspecific recognition. consistent with the results of plaque assay (Fig. 3C ) (p < 0.01). The expression of endogenous DDX5 or DDX5 mutants were confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-HA monoclonal antibody and anti-DDX5 polyclonal antibody (Fig. 3D) . Both of the results demonstrated that DDX5 helicase activity plays important roles in JEV replication.",

In flavivirus, NS5 can be separated into two domains: methyltransferase (MTase) domain and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain (Ackermann and Padmanabhan, 2001; Egloff et al., 2002; Guyatt et al., 2001; Koonin, 1993) .

In our study, we divided NS5 into two domains (MTase and RdRp domains) to detect their interactions with DDX5 in details. We used GST-pulldown assay to monitor the interactions between JEV core, NS3, NS5-MTase or NS5-RdRp and DDX5 or vice versa. The results showed GST-DDX5 can interact with His-tagged JEV core, NS3, NS5-Mtase and NS5-RdRp, while GST protein can not (Fig. 4A) .

The glutathione-Sparse 4B beads were first incubated with the GST-DDX5. After unbound GST-DDX5 protein was washed away, JEV core, NS3 or NS5 (MTase or RdRp domains) was mixed with the beads. The various amount of other viral protein was further incubated with the beads to compete the bound viral protein from DDX5.

DDX5 interacts with the JEV core, NS3, NS5 proteins and colocalizes with them during virus infection NS5 and NS3 have been hypothesized to seed the formation of virus replication complexes, and they may form replication complex together with 3 0 noncoding region of JEV genomic RNA (Uchil and Satchidanandam, 2003a) and the core protein can bind to the viral RNA to participate in virus replication (Khromykh and Westaway, 1996) . Since GST-pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that DDX5 can interact with the JEV core, NS3, NS5-MTase and NS5-RdRp proteins. We further determined if DDX5 can interact with these proteins during virus infection. The BHK-21 cells were infected with JEV (MOI = 0.01). 24 h later, the anti-DDX5 polyclonal antibody was used to co-immunoprecipitate proteins from the whole cell lysate which was also treated with RNase (100 lg/ml) and DNase (100 lg/ml). The results showed JEV core, NS3, and NS5 proteins can be co-immunoprecipitated by DDX5 compared with the control IgG (Fig. 7A) , confirming that DDX5 interacts with viral proteins that are important for virus replication and the interaction between them was not mediated by RNA or DNA. Furthermore, confocal microscopy analysis demonstrated that DDX5 colocalized with JEV core, NS3 and NS5 proteins mainly in the cytoplasm during virus infection. In uninfected cells, most of DDX5 still localized in the nucleus, the serum of the unimmunized mouse was used as the control (Fig. 7B) .",

We constructed a luciferase-containing JEV replicon according to the previous study (Chien et al., 2011) . BHK-21 cells were first transfected with DDX5i shRNA plasmid to knockdown the expression of DDX5, the non-targeting shRNA was used as the control. The cells were then transfected with in vitro-transcribed luciferase-containing JEV-replicon RNA and firefly luciferase RNA as the internal control. The cells were harvested for dual luciferase assays at 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h post transfection. The results showed that there were two peaks of replicon luciferase activity corresponding to the first translation and the second replication peak (Fig. 9A) . The luciferase activities were nearly the same in the DDX5i and control treated BHK-21 cells in the first peak, while luciferase activities were lower for all of the time points in the DDX5i treated BHK-21 cells in the second peak. The data showed that viral RNA replication, but not the viral protein translation, was hampered by DDX5 knockdown. Meanwhile, the luciferase activity derived from a control reporter, Renilla luciferase flanked by cellular GAPDH 5 0 and 3 0 UTRs did not significantly changed between the shDDX5 and control treated cells (Fig. 9B) , which means that the translation of cellular protein was not hampered by DDX5 knockdown. Collectively, our results strongly suggested that DDX5 is involved in viral RNA replication by binding to JEV 3 0 UTR.",

However, viral resistance to antiviral agents has been a problem. One possible solution to overcome this problem is to target host cellular factors important for the viral life cycle. DDX5 plays important roles in many virus, such as SARS-CoV, influenza virus and HCV (Chen et al., 2009; Goh et al., 2004) , and other cellular helicases such as DDX3, DDX1, DDX56 are also involved in many virus replication and the assembly of virions (Xu et al., 2011; Xu and Hobman, 2012) . Two studies reported novel DDX3 inhibitors against HIV infection Radi et al., 2012) . Therefore, the cellular helicases have been proposed as a promising target to design novel agents to control viral infection that poses major global health threats (Geiss et al., 2009; Kwong et al., 2005; Stankiewicz-Drogo\u0144 et al., 2010) .",

By using GST-pulldown and coimmunoprecipitation, we demonstrated that DDX5 can interact with JEV core, NS3, NS5-MTase and NS5-RdRp, suggesting that DDX5 might act as a cofactor for JEV proteins in virus replication. It has been suggested that cellular proteins can bind to viral 5 0 and/or 3 0 UTR to modulate viral translation and/or replication (Chen et al., 1997) . Our studies showed that DDX5 can only interact with viral 3 0 UTR and colocalize with viral RNA. We further confirmed that DDX5 plays an important role in virus RNA replication but not in viral protein translation, which is consistent with its ability to bind to viral 3 0 UTR. We performed the competition binding studies to map the interaction interfaces between DDX5 and viral proteins. The viral RNA replication is a quite dynamic process, and other host factors are also recruited by the viral proteins to facilitate this process (Lindenbach et al., 2005; Uchil and Satchidanandam, 2003a) . We suspected that the interaction interfaces shown in our competition binding studies might not always exist during viral RNA replication. . The firefly luciferase reporter was used as the internal control. At various times post transfection, cell lysates were collected for dualluciferase assays. Renilla luciferase activity was normalized to that of firefly luciferase activity. The differences between means were considered significant at \u2044 p < 0.05, very significant \u2044\u2044 p < 0.01. Some negative-stranded RNA viruses use the host cytoplasm as the primary site of replication, they can also recruit nuclear factors and alter their nuclear-cytoplasm trafficking to enhance viral replication (Hiscox, 2003) . The host nucleus proteins could be recruited to cytoplasm to facilitate flaviviruses replication (Uchil and Satchidanandam, 2003b; Zebovitz et al., 1974) . It has been reported that DDX5 is redistributed into the cytoplasm during HCV infection (Goh et al., 2004) . Consistent with this, our study showed that DDX5 might be recruited to the cytoplasm and colocalize with the JEV core, NS3 and NS5 and viral RNA during the infection to facilitate the unwinding the intermediate RNA duplexes. Since LMB can inhibit all the CRM1-mediated export of proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Wang et al., 2009a) , we cannot rule out the trafficking of other cellular proteins inhibited by LMB which might also be important for virus replication. Our result showed that virus can still replicate at low titers after LMB treatment. Considering that DDX5 shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasma, we speculated the small amount of DDX5 resides in cytoplasma after LMB treatment still exerts its role in virus replication. Meanwhile, it is also possible that DDX5 is only used to increase the efficiency of RNA separation so that the viral RdRp can transcribe viral RNA more efficiently during virus replication.",
