Coronavirus particles are basically spherical, although negatively stained air-dried particles are often pleomorphic. They usually have a diameter, excluding projections, of between 80 and 120 nm, although in extreme cases the diameter Can vary between 60 and 220 nm. The particles possess distinctive, tear-drop-shaped projections about 20 nm in length. Fig. 12 .1 shows a preparation of typical coronavirus particles by negative staining. Particles are often seen with incomplete coronas of surface projections, which may be an artefact of preparation. Two populations of IBV particles can be separated on equilibrium sucrose gradients. Particles with an average density of 1.18 g/cm3 have typical coronavirus morphology and contain all the structural polypeptides and a complete genome, while less dense particles of average density 1.13 g/cm3 have typical coronavirus morphology on negative staining but lack the nucleocapsid polypeptide and genome. These particle types can be differentiated on shadowing with carbodplatinum ( Fig. 12. 2). The lighter particles ( Fig. 12 .2a) are more flattened, producing shorter shadows than the particles with typical density of 1.18 g/cm3 ( Fig. 12.2b ).",

In ultrathin sections coronavirus particles display a triple-track membrane, but the surface projections are usually not visualized. Underneath the membrane is an electron-dense layer 10-20 nm wide. The centre appears usually less dense (Fig. 12.4a) . However, in some species (e.g. IBV, FIPV, TGEV, BCV and MHV) the virus interior is rather electron-dense and closely apposed to the membrane ( Fig.   12 .4b). Finally, virus particles with a narrow electron-dense band directly beneath the membrane have also been described ( Fig. 12.4~ ).",

The conventional structure on negative staining consists of tear-drop-shaped projections ( Fig. 12.5a ), although cone-shaped projections (Fig. 12 .5b) are also observed. In all these cases the projections have the same length of about 20 nm. Other coronaviruses have short (5-10 nm) as well as 20-nm projections ( Fig. 12.6 ). Projections with blebs on thin stalks have been reported for other coronaviruses. Most authors suggest that the surface glycoprotein projection polypeptide is a high molecular weight glycoprotein of about 180 000 which may be an association of two non-identical subunits of about 90 000 or which can readily be cleaved into two molecules of about 90000. IBV may be an exception to this in that the higher molecular weight form has not been observed. The surface projections can be quantitatively removed by pronase or bromelain and the polypeptides are probably anchored to, or in, the viral envelope through a short hydrophobic region.",
