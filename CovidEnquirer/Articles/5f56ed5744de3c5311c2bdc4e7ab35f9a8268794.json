In this study, we found that memory T-cell responses against the spike (S) protein were persistent for more than 1 year after SARS-CoV infection by detecting the production of IFN-g using ELISA and ELISpot assays. Flow cytometric analysis showed that both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were involved in cellular responses against SARS-CoV infection. Interestingly, most of SARS-CoV S-specific memory CD4 + T cells were central memory cells expressing CD45RO + CCR7 + CD62L \u00c0 . However, the majority of memory CD8 + T cells revealed effector memory phenotype expressing CD45RO \u00c0 CCR7 \u00c0 CD62L \u00c0 . Thus, our study provides the evidence that SARS-CoV infection in humans can induce cellular immune response that is persistent for a long period of time. These data may have an important implication in the possibility of designing effective vaccine against SARS-CoV infection, specifically in defining T-cell populations that are implicated in protective immunity.

The etiologic agent of the syndrome, a novel coronavirus termed SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been identified [1] [2] [3] . Although the epidemic was eventually controlled, the high morbidity and mortality make it extremely urgent to develop effective means to prevent this disease. Therefore, a successful vaccine against SARS-CoV remains a high priority. The unique opportunity of studying survivors of the infection allows for delineation of the T-cell populations implicated in the protective immunity, and those T cells would be the target population for expansion via a vaccine.",

In addition, SARS-CoVspecific IgG antibody can be detected at week 3 after the onset of syndrome in SARS patients and persistent for a long period of time [9, 10] . Polyclonal immune sera from convalescent SARS patients were passively transferred to treat SARS patients during the outbreak in 2003 [11] .

Although it has been demonstrated that DNA vaccine encoding the S protein of SARS-CoV can induce antigenspecific T-cell responses in animal models [4, 12] , the protective effect of T cells specific for the S protein in humans remains undefined [13] . Thus, it is essential to determine whether recovered SARS patients maintained cell-mediated immunity against SARS-CoV and how long this immunity will persist. In addition, the phenotypic characteristics of memory CD4 + or CD8 + T cells specific for SARS-CoV have not been extensively studied. In this study, we analyzed CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell responses in peripheral blood of recovered SARS patients to a pool of 169 overlapping SARS-CoV S peptides and characterized the phenotype of memory T-cell subpopulations. Our study demonstrated that SARS-CoV S-specific memory CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in peripheral blood of recovered SARS patients were persistent for more than 1 year after infection. These memory T cells revealed both effector and central memory phenotypes.",

These memory T cells persisted for more than 1 year after recovery in peripheral blood of SARS individuals. These data were further confirmed by IFN-g ELISpot assay showing a high frequency of SARS-CoV S-specific IFN-gproducing T cells in recovered SARS patients. Our results are consistent with the report that two newly identified HLA-A*0201-restricted CD8 + T-cell epitopes from SARS-CoV S protein, S1203 and S978, elicit memory T-cell responses in PBMCs from HLA-A*0201 + recovered SARS patients up to 3 months post-infection [13, 14] .",

However, little is known about memory CD4 + T-cell responses to SARS-CoV. Consistent with observation in mouse model [4] , we found that both memory CD4 + and CD8 + T cells participated in cellular responses to SARS-CoV. It is known that naive CD4 + T cells can be divided into two major subpopulations, Th1 and Th2, based on cytokine production and biological functions [16] . The Th1 cells are composed of IFN-g + and IFN-g \u00c0 cells. The IFN-g \u00c0 Th1 cells may differentiate into memory cells in vivo [17] . Based on the production of IFN-g and IL-2, SARS-CoV S-specific CD4 + T cells could be divided into three distinct populations: single IFN-g-secreting cells, double IFN-g/IL-2-secreting cells and single IL-2-secreting cells. Interestingly, IFN-g/ IL-2 double positive CD4 + T cells were mainly restricted to IFN-g high IL-2 high subset. These results further demonstrated the heterogeneity of memory Th1 cells and also indicated that distinct subpopulations of memory CD4 + T cells have different capacities to develop into short (IFNg + ) and long-lived (IFN-g + IL-2 + and IL-2 + ) memory cells.",

Recently, SSp-1, an HLA-A*0201-restricted CD8 + T-cell epitope, was identified from SARS-CoV S protein. The SSp-1-specific CTL cells displayed the CD45RA + CCR7 \u00c0 CD62L \u00c0 phenotype, after PBMCs from recovered SARS patients were stimulated in vitro with heat-inactivated SARS-CoV for 7 days [18] .

This observation is in agreement with recent studies showing that only central memory CD8 + T cells produce IL-2 following a short-peptide stimulation in lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-infected mouse model [19] . Generally, the expression of CD62L is associated with the expression of CCR7 [20] . Surprisingly, SARS-CoV Sspecific memory CD4 + T cells expressed a mixed CCR7 + CD62L \u00c0 phenotype that differs from phenotypes of classical CCR7 + CD62L + T CM and CCR7 \u00c0 CD62L \u00c0 T EM cells. Some groups have also found memory CD4 + or CD8 + T cells expressing a mixed CCR7 + CD62L \u00c0 phenotype in mouse model [21, 22] . These studies suggest that the expression of CCR7 and CD62L in memory CD4 + or CD8 + T cells may overlap only partially.",

Recent report has identified two functional distinct populations of memory CD8 + T cells: double IFN-g/IL-2-secreting cells and single IFN-g-secreting cells. Virus-specific IFN-g/IL-2-secreting CD8 + T cells were CD45RA \u00c0 CCR7 \u00c0 , whereas single IFN-g-secreting CD8 + T cells were either CD45RA \u00c0 CCR7 \u00c0 or CD45RA + CCR7 \u00c0 [24] . Consistent with observations in HIV infection, we showed that SARS-CoV S-specific CD8 + T cells produced IFN-g but not IL-2 and predominantly displayed CD45RO \u00c0 CCR7 \u00c0 phenotype which might represent terminally differentiated effector memory T cells [25] . This may reflect difference in the inherent stability of CD4 + and CD8 + memory T cells that are CCR7 \u00c0 in normal steady-state conditions [26] .",
