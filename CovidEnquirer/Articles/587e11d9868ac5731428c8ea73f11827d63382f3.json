These outbreaks have led to a global influenza pandemic (Brownstein et al., 2009) . Recent surveillance data show that the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 is co-circulating with seasonal influenza viruses in many countries (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/pdf/External F0939.pdf; http://www.who.int/csr/don/2009 10 23/en/index.html). Because pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 and seasonal influenza transmit in a similar manner and present almost identical symptoms (http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/qa.htm), the control and prevention of this novel pandemic has been challenging. Critical for viral containment, surveillance, and treatment is the development of sensitive, accurate, and reliable diagnostic tests that can discriminate the H1N1 influenza virus from other strains.",

Other primers and probes for the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 virus and for seasonal influenza viruses such as human H1N1 and H3N2 were designed based on the sequence data obtained from the Influenza Virus Resource (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU/) ( Table 1) . Primers/probes for typing of the viral strains were designed to target the conserved regions of the M gene segment for the influenza A virus and of the NP gene segment for the influenza B virus. Primers/probes for subtyping of viral strains were designed to target the HA gene segment for each of the three HA subtypes (H1-consensus, H1-pandemic A/H1N1 2009 and H3) and the NA gene segment for each of the three NA subtypes (N1consensus, N1-pandemic A/H1N1 2009 and N2).

Copies of RNA extracts of the three known and 11 unknown subtypes of influenza A virus strains were quantified by SYBR green rRT-PCR. Quantification was done using a standard curve made by serial dilutions of pGEM-NP, a plasmid containing a partial NP gene of influenza A virus (data not shown).

Other respiratory viral nucleic acid extracts including influenza B virus, coronavirus OC43 and adenovirus were tested at high TCID 50 s ( Table 2 ).

            "text": "The newly developed multiplex rRT-PCR system has several advantages over other assays for detection of influenza viruses. First, it is more sensitive than conventional PCR assays in subtyping influenza A viruses (P = 6.15 \u00d7 10 \u22125 compared with seasonal influenza A virus detection; and P = 8.74 \u00d7 10 \u22124 for H1N1 subtyping). The analysis of the LOD for pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 virus indicates that the strategy of multiple-targeting detection ensures the sensitivity of the assay system and effectively lowers the false-negative rate. Second, owing to the de-novo design of primers/probes for two target genes (H1-2009 and N1-2009 of the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 virus, and H3 and N2 +  119  18  137  0  31  31  52  13  65  68  4  72  0  2  2  31  0  31  \u2212  0  14  14  0  120  120  0  86  86  0  79  79  0  149  149  1  119  120  Total  119  32  151  0  151  151  52  99  151  68  83  151  0  151  151  32  119 of the H3N2 subtype, etc.), the multiplex rRT-PCR assay is specific for the detection of the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 virus (Fig. 1A) and that of the H3N2 subtype ( Fig. 1C and Fig. 2A) .",

            "text": "As shown here, one sample identified as pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 by the US CDC's rRT-PCR assay was confirmed to be the H3N2 subtype by the new assay. Based on sequence alignment, the H1-2009 primers/probes had very low homologies with that for H3N2 (Fig. 2B) . However, there were high homologies between the SW H1 primers/probes of the US CDC's rRT-PCR and some H3N2 strains (such as A/Hong Kong/1-9-MA21-3/1968, a strain that is highly homologous to the sequencing product of this test). In particular, the SW H1 reverse primer has eight continuous matches with HA sequences found at the 3 end in H3N2, an important terminal site for primer specificity (Kwok et al., 1990; Peacey et al., 2009) (Fig. 2C) . Third, in the new multiplex rRT-PCR system, the consensus primers/probes cover the majority of HA and NA sequences of each human influenza A subtype (H1, H3, N1 and N2) found in the Influenza Virus Resource database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU/) (Table 3) . This allows the new assay to identify a wide range of influenza subtypes, as seen in Tables 6 and 2 , which present data for subtyping 105 randomly selected influenza A virus positive samples collected between January 2007 and December 2008, and 11 influenza A virus isolates of unknown subtypes. Fourth, the new multiplex rRT-PCR assay is highly flexible, as primers/probes can be easily adapted for the detection of some other or newly occurring subtypes of influenza viruses. This adaptation would make the multiplex rRT-PCR a useful platform for the simultaneous detection and surveillance of multiple influenza viruses and/or possibly other pathogens.",
