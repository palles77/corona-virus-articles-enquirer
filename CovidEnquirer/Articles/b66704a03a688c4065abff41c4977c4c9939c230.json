We investigated the hepatic effects of the novel thiazolidinedione (TZDs), lobeglitazone (Duvie) in T2D patients with NAFLD. We recruited drug-na\u00efve or metformin-treated T2D patients with NAFLD to conduct a multicenter, prospective, open-label, exploratory clinical trial. Transient liver elastography (Fibroscan\u00ae; Echosens, Paris, France) with controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) was used to non-invasively quantify hepatic fat contents. Fifty patients with CAP values above 250 dB/m were treated once daily with 0.5 mg lobeglitazone for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was a decline in CAP values, and secondary endpoints included changes in components of glycemic, lipid, and liver profiles. Lobeglitazone-treated patients showed significantly decreased CAP values (313.4 dB/m at baseline vs. 297.8 dB/m at 24 weeks; P = 0.016), regardless of glycemic control. Lobeglitazone improved HbA1C values (7.41% [57.5 mM/M] vs. 6.56% [48.2 mM/M]; P < 0.001), as well as the lipid and liver profiles of the treated patients. Moreover, multivariable linear regression analysis showed that hepatic fat reduction by lobeglitazone was independently associated with baseline values of CAP, liver stiffness, and liver enzymes, and metformin use. Lobeglitazone treatment reduced intrahepatic fat content, as assessed by transient liver elastography, and improved glycemic, liver, and lipid profiles in T2D patients with NAFLD. Further randomized controlled trials using liver histology as an end point are necessary to evaluate the efficacy of lobeglitazone for NAFLD treatment (Clinical trial No. NCT02285205).",

            "text": "As patients with NAFLD are mostly asymptomatic, the gold standard for its diagnosis is based on liver biopsy, which is highly invasive and expensive. Alternatively, imaging techniques, such as ultrasound (US), computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, are used for NAFLD diagnosis (10) . Among these methods, abdominal US is commonly used due to its relatively low expense. However, the major drawbacks of US include its inability to quantify liver fat amounts and its variability due to examiner techniques. Recently, a novel physical index, called controlled attenuation parameter (CAP), has been developed based on the properties of ultrasonic signals examined by transient liver elastography (Fibroscan \u00ae ; Echosens, Paris, France). CAP relies on the concept that fat attenuates US propagation, and it non-invasively quantizes this ultrasonic attenuation at the center frequency of the FibroScan \u00ae M probe (3.5 MHz) (11) . Furthermore, a large prospective study has demonstrated the accuracy of CAP in diagnosing NAFLD (12) .",

TZDs are potent peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists that lower blood glucose levels by ameliorating systemic insulin sensitivity and inflammation (13) . Recently, a novel TZD called lobeglitazone was developed, and is currently being prescribed for T2D in Korea (14) . The efficacy and safety of lobeglitazone in T2D has been well-investigated (15) (16) (17) . To identify better treatment options for T2D patients with NAFLD, we investigated the effects of lobeglitazone on these patients by analyzing alterations in their CAP values using transient liver elastography, as well as in their glycemic, lipid, and liver profiles.",

Because US was not performed to investigate the study endpoint and merely used to rule out other liver disorders, the US methods and devices were not standardized.",

However, optimal strategies for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD, particularly in the context of glucose metabolism, have not yet been fully investigated. Guidelines put forth by the AGA and the AASLD have recommended that TZD pioglitazone be used to treat patients with biopsy-proven, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (5, 20) . Therefore, we hypothesized that lobeglitazone, a novel TZD, could alleviate hepatic steatosis and improve hepatic function in T2D patients with CAP-proven NAFLD. In this multicenter, prospective, and exploratory trial, transient liver elastography assessed that a 24week treatment with lobeglitazone had significantly ameliorated hepatic steatosis in T2D patients with NAFLD, independent of glycemic control. Lobeglitazone treatment also resulted in improved glycemic profiles with reduced HbA1C and HOMAIR values, lipid profiles with increased HDL-C and decreased TG levels, and liver profiles with decreased AST, ALT, and \u03b3GTP levels. Multiple linear regression analyses further demonstrated that hepatic fat reduction by lobeglitazone was independently associated with baseline CAP values, metformin use, and chang- (22) reported that rosiglitazone ameliorates hepatic steatosis and aminotransferases, but not necroinflammation or fibrosis. A randomized clinical trial (RCT) conducted with 55 NASH patients who had impaired glucose tolerance or T2D, showed that pioglitazone treatment improves liver enzyme profiles and NASH histology, but not fibrosis (23) . Moreover, the trial also found that 73% of the pioglitazone-treated, compared with 24% of the placebo-treated, NASH patients showed improvement. Another RCT, conducted with 61 non-diabetic NASH patients, showed that a 12-month treatment with pioglitazone does not improve steatosis, but ameliorates hepatocellular injury and fibrosis, compared with placebo treatment on NASH patients (25) . However, the Pioglitazone versus Vitamin E versus Placebo for the Treatment of Nondiabetic Patients with Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (PIVENS) trial, which is a multicenter RCT of 247 non-diabetic patients with NASH, showed that 69% of pioglitazone-treated patients, compared with 31% of placebo-treated patients, achieved improvements in hepatosteatosis, as assessed by histology (P < 0.001) (24) .",

Similarly, in this study, we demonstrated that lobeglitazone treatment in NAFLD patients improved hepatic steatosis, as assessed by CAP, and liver enzyme profiles, as assessed by aminotransferase and \u03b3GTP levels, but not liver fibrosis, based on measurements of liver stiffness. Because this was not a liver-biopsy proven study, we could not assess alterations in hepatic inflammation and hepatocellular ballooning following treatment. Regarding CAP, previous studies have analyzed the association of CAP values with liver histology, particularly in NAFLD patients with high-grade steatosis and elevated BMI, and have verified the utility of CAP as a non-invasive tool for diagnosing and monitoring NAFLD patients (27) (28) (29) (30) . However, despite its relatively high accuracy in detecting hepatic steatosis, the agreement between histologic analysis and CAP in hepatic fat quantification varies among individuals with mild steatosis (27) . Thus, for our study, we recruited T2D subjects with NAFLD using a higher cut-off CAP value (250 dB/m).",

            "text": "A previous study had suggested that better glycemic control affects improvement in fatty liver in T2D patients in response to drug treatment (31) . Thus, it could be argued that improvement of glycemic control alone might be responsible for reduced hepatic steatosis. To address this concern, we, in our current study, classified patients into two groups according to their lobeglitazone responsiveness. During the 24-week trial, two subjects, one in the responder group and the other in the non-responder group, received 2.0 mg glimepiride for rescue therapy. With the exception of these two subjects, participants showed improved glycemic control, as assessed by HbA1C and GA levels. Interestingly, although CAP values were only significantly reduced in the responder group, HbA1C values were significantly reduced in both the responder and non-responder groups. These data suggest that the reduction in hepatosteatosis is independent of the degree of glycemic control. There have been studies that investigate the pharmacologic mechanisms of TZDs in altering fat content and adipocytes (13) , and these mechanisms are thought to positively affect the distribution of fat mass and the proliferation of adipocytes resulting in weight gain (32) . Nevertheless, TZDs have also been shown to reduce liver fat content and enhance peripheral tissue glucose uptake (31) . In this regard, the negative side effects of TZDs on weight gain should be viewed in a balanced manner. Previous studies have shown that pioglitazone treatment increases body weight between 2.5 and 4.7 kg, depending on the study (23) (24) (25) . In our study, lobeglitazone treatment showed a lower increase in the average body weight of 1.4 kg (from 76.5 \u00b1 11.1 kg to 77.9 \u00b1 11.8 kg [P = 0.001]), which is similar to the weight gain, ranging from 0.89 to 1.48 kg, that was observed in other clinical trials using 0.5 mg/day lobeglitazone (15) (16) (17) .",

            "text": "In this study, we identified predictive factors that were associated with lobeglitazone responsiveness, and found that individuals with higher values of CAP, WBC, and ALT, and lower values of LSM and \u03b3GTP at baseline showed greater reductions in hepatic fat following lobeglitazone treatment. Although most previous trials with TZDs did not analyze predictors of responsiveness, a trial with rosiglitazone showed that responders have lower baseline \u03b3GTP levels and higher baseline amounts of steatosis than non-responders (22) , which is consistent with our findings. Similar to previous studies (22, 25) , we also observed greater reductions in the ALT levels of responders, compared with those observed in non-responders, following treatment. Previous studies have also shown that responders show greater increments in serum adiponectin levels after TZD treatment than non-responders (22, 23) . Furthermore, Ratziu et al. (22) reported greater reductions in insulin levels in responders to rosiglitazone than in non-responders, which we did not observe in our trial. Such difference was likely due to the fact that 100% of patients in our study had diabetes, whereas only 32% of the patients in the Ratziu et al. (22) study had diabetes. Moreover, our multiple regression analysis demonstrated that patients treated with metformin and lobeglitazone showed a greater reduction in hepatic steatosis than patients treated with lobeglitazone alone. Previous RCTs have shown inconsistent effects using metformin alone to treat NAFLD (5, 33) ; thus, the combination of metformin and lobeglitazone may synergistically act to reduce hepatic fat. One plausible explanation could be that they act together on the pathogenic heterogeneities in NAFLD. For example, lobeglitazone may play a role in decreasing the availability of plasma fatty acids arising from adipose tissue through abated lipolysis and the positive distribution of fat mass; on the other hand, metformin may activate either fatty acid oxidation or lipophagy, as well as mitophagy, via upregulation of the adenosine monophosphate kinase and/or sirtuin 1 pathways (34, 35) . In addition, metformin may ameliorate the adverse effects of weight gain caused by TZD treatment.",

Lobeglitazone is a novel TZD; thus, its long-term safety in treating patients with NAFLD has not been established. Moreover, findings from the current study should be taken with some caution in that our clinical trials included a relatively small number of participants, without having any quality control for CAP measurements conducted by the five centers. Additionally, we did not perform liver biopsy, which is the gold standard method, to evaluate the status of NAFLD because it is a highly invasive and costly procedure. Furthermore, our study does not clearly show how lobeglitazone works on NAFLD. Finally, we performed a single-arm trial without a placebo or an active arm. However, even with these limitations, the current study has several strengths: First, we conducted a study with the novel drug lobeglitazone to assess its additional benefits on NAFLD in T2D patients. Second, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first trial to demonstrate that CAP can be used as a simple, non-invasive tool to quantify and monitor changes in liver fat content during intervention. Finally, we identified several parameters that may be used to predict NAFLD-patient response to lobeglitazone treatment.",

Furthermore, increased steatosis grade and metformin use in patients at baseline, as well as decreased ALT and LSM levels after treatment, were all reliable factors in predicting responsiveness to lobeglitazone. Together, our data indicate that lobeglitazone is a valid, novel therapeutic that should be used to treat NAFLD patients with T2D. ",
