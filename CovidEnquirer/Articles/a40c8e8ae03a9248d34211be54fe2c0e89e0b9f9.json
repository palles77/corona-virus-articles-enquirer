Here, using methyl-beta-cyclodextrin and fluorescently tagged PRV, we directly show that depletion of cholesterol from the plasma membrane of host cells significantly reduces PRV entry. Cholesterol depletion did not reduce PRV attachment, but stalled virus particles at the plasma membrane before penetration of the cell. Cholesterol depletion results in destabilization of lipid raft microdomains in the plasma membrane, which have been shown before to be involved in efficient entry of different viruses. A significant fraction of PRV virions appears to localize juxtaposed to GM1, a lipid raft marker, during entry. Together, these data indicate that cholesterol and possibly cholesterol-rich lipid rafts may be important during PRV entry.",

PRV is often used as a model for this subfamily to study general aspects of alphaherpesvirus replication and spread (Pomeranz et al., 2005) . The PRV virion consists of a core with the linear double stranded DNA genome, an icosahedral capsid, a largely amorphous protein mass called the tegument and the envelope with embedded, often glycosylated envelope proteins. As alphaherpesviruses are large viruses with a complex virion structure, they use the cellular machinery for different aspects of their replication cycle.",

            "text": "Cholesterol represents one of the key constituents of small, dynamic, sterol-and sphingolipid-enriched domains on the plasma membrane which are called lipid rafts and which compartmentalize cellular processes (Pike, 2006) . Removal of cholesterol from the plasma membrane leads to loss of lipid raft functionality. This approach is widely used to determine a possible role of lipid rafts in different processes. Many viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Viard et al., 2002) , severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS) (Li et al., 2007) , murine coronavirus (Choi et al., 2005) , poliovirus (Danthi and Chow, 2004) , human herpesvirus 6 (Huang et al., 2006) , vaccinia virus (Chung et al., 2005) , and foot-and-mouth disease virus (Martin-Acebes et al., 2007) have been reported to depend on plasma membrane cholesterol or, more specifically, lipid rafts for efficient entry. However, there are only a few indications in literature about a possible role for cholesterol and/or lipid rafts in alphaherpesvirus entry. A role for lipid rafts during alphaherpesvirus infection has been suggested based on an association of the herpes simplex virus 1 envelope protein gB, but not the envelope glycoproteins gD, gC and gH, with lipid rafts during entry (Bender et al., 2003) . It was also reported that HSV entry was suppressed after cholesterol depletion or chelation (Bender et al., 2003) and that infectivity of VZV was sensitive to the same treatment (Hambleton et al., 2007) , indicating a role for cholesterol during the early stages of alphaherpesvirus infections. As in many other studies, these reports determined an effect of cholesterol depletion on virus entry by assessing immediate-early gene expression (HSV) and infectious foci formation (VZV), and therefore do not completely discriminate between effects of cholesterol depletion on different post-attachment stages of entry such as penetration, capsid transport to the nucleus, genome deposition in the nucleus, and onset of viral gene expression. The aim of the current study was to assess directly the role of plasma membrane cholesterol during alphaherpesvirus entry.",

To assess the importance of cholesterol during PRV entry, plasma membrane cholesterol was removed from cells in adhesion by 10 mM methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MBCD) treatment and was either or not replenished by addition of 5 or 100 \u03bcg/ml cholesterol. Cholesterol measurement with the Amplex \u00ae Red Cholesterol assay kit revealed that MBCD treatment removed cholesterol efficiently and that the cholesterol content was restored by addition of cholesterol (Fig. 1B) . Entry was analyzed quantitatively and entry of PRV was reduced significantly after MBCD treatment: 60% reduction of the number of perinuclear virions relative to control cells (Figs. 1A and C) . Repleting cellular cholesterol after MBCD treatment by addition of cholesterol restored this reduction: 33% reduction relative to control cells after addition of 5 \u03bcg/ml cholesterol and 10% reduction relative to control cells after addition of 100 \u03bcg/ml cholesterol (Figs. 1A and C) . This indicates that plasma membrane cholesterol plays an important role during entry of PRV particles in the host cell. To confirm that all green punctae observed represent virus particles, composition of the viral inoculum was analyzed by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1D ). All observed GFP punctae in the inoculum were found to co-label for gB and therefore represent enveloped virus particles. Hence, all GFP detected in the current assay represent virus particles. Punctae single positive for gB and of similar size as virus particles were also frequently observed. These punctae may perhaps represent capsid-less L-particles, which have been described before for several alphaherpesviruses (Aleman et al., 2003; Subak-Sharpe and Dargan, 1998) .",

To further determine whether or not the virions that are stalled at the plasma membrane after MBCD treatment had passed this membrane, we used a trypsin-based assay. Trypsin-based assays have been used before to remove non-internalized particles from the plasma membrane (Nishi and Saigo, 2007) . In contrast to virions that have passed the plasma membrane, virions that are bound to the plasma membrane, but did not pass it, are removed by a trypsin treatment of the cells. Trypsin treatment efficiently removed particles from the plasma membrane in a control experiment when cells had been inoculated at 4\u00b0C (Figs. 4A and B, lower panels). Trypsin treatment also removed almost all plasma membrane-associated virions in MBCD-treated cells (Figs. 4A and B, middle panels and C). As expected, the number of perinuclear virions in MBCD-treated cells was not affected by the trypsin treatment (Fig. 4C ). This indicates that MBCD treatment suppresses penetration of PRV in host cells.",

A significant fraction of virus particles appeared to localize juxtaposed to GM1: there was a small overlap of fluorescent signal between virus particle and GM1 signal (Fig. 5A) . Only a minority of particles was found to fully co-localize with spots of GM1 staining and only a minority of particles was found not to associate at all with spots of GM1 staining. A similar juxtaposed localization of PRV with GM1 was observed in live cells that were not fixed (data not shown). However, GM1 covered a very large fraction of the cell surface, which is in agreement with other findings (Kenworthy et al., 2000) . Since the total lipid raft area constituted such a large fraction of the cell surface, an additional experiment was set up to exclude the possibility that the frequently observed juxtaposed localization of PRV with lipid rafts was a chance effect. To this end, lipid rafts were aggregated in larger clusters (patches) as described before (Harder et al., 1998) , before the addition of virus. Again, a significant fraction of PRV virions appeared to localize juxtaposed to clustered GM1 (Figs. 5B, upper panels and C). The patching process did not affect the entry efficiency of the virus (data not shown). As an extra, blind control, unrelated images of PRV virions and patched GM1 were merged and virion localization was scored as before, resulting in significantly less juxtaposed localization of virions with GM1 (30 \u00b1 8% versus 56 \u00b1 7% in real images, P value = 0.000) and significantly more virions that were not associated with GM1 (45 \u00b1 9% versus 30 \u00b1 6% in real images, P value = 0.008) (Figs. 5B, lower panels and C). In conclusion, a significant fraction of PRV appears to localize juxtaposed to the lipid raft marker GM1 during entry.",

The observed effect of cyclodextrin is then often attributed to an effect on entry by comparing the effect on cells that were pretreated and cells that were treated at the post-entry stage (Choi et al., 2005; Chung et al., 2005; Danthi and Chow, 2004; Hambleton et al., 2007; Li et al., 2007) . The current study evaluated the role of cholesterol during entry of the alphaherpesvirus PRV in a direct manner: fluorescently tagged virus particles that entered the cell at 2 h p.i. were quantified. This allowed us to conclude with great certainty that the observed effect of cholesterol depletion is due to hampered viral entry and not to a further step in viral infection. The used technique also allowed us to distinguish between different stages of entry: attachment, penetration and capsid transport to the nucleus. Flow cytometric analysis, determination of virion localization and virus sensitivity to trypsin treatment revealed that the stage of entry affected by MBCD is not attachment to the host cell, but penetration of the plasma membrane.",

            "text": "Importance of cholesterol and/or lipid rafts during viral entry has been related to different aspects of the viral entry process. Lipid rafts could create a favourable environment around target membrane receptors, facilitating oligomerization of (co)receptors or recognition of (co)receptors by the virus (Burger et al., 2000; Viard et al., 2002) . Another explanation may be that the signal transduction molecules that are particularly concentrated in lipid rafts (Brown, 2006; Brown and London, 1998, 2000; Dykstra et al., 2003; Helms and Zurzolo, 2004; Simons and Toomre, 2000) facilitate specific steps in viral entry, such as penetration or transport of the capsid to the nucleus. E.g., during human herpesvirus 8-entry, lipid rafts have been suggested to be important for modification of signalling molecules, microtubule dynamics and nuclear delivery, but are dispensable for binding and penetration (Raghu et al., 2007) . The importance of lipid rafts can also be due to the requirement for the specific classes of lipids that associate with lipid rafts: cholesterol but also sphingolipids. The concept of lipid recognition by certain proteins might be an important factor in viral entry (Teissier and Pecheur, 2007) . During retroviral entry, specific lipids have an apparent role in conformational changes leading to the proper exposure of the fusion peptide toward the target membrane (Alfsen and Bomsel, 2002; Chazal and Gerlier, 2003) . As membrane curvature mainly depends on the molecular shape of lipids, lipids also play a key role in the membrane deformation that is required for penetration of the plasma membrane (Teissier and Pecheur, 2007) .",

            "text": "Our observation that a significant fraction of PRV appears to localize juxtaposed to GM1, a lipid raft marker, during entry may suggest a weak or partial raft association that facilitates penetration. Such a weak or partial interaction with rafts is in agreement with the findings of Bender et al. (2003) for HSV (Bender et al., 2003) . Using flotation assays, these authors found that the viral glycoprotein gB, but not gD, gC, gH nor the HSV receptors HVEM and nectin associates with lipid rafts during entry. This interaction is mediated by the ectodomain of gB (Bender et al., 2003) . The authors hypothesized that a cellular gB receptor is enriched in rafts and that the size of the alphaherpesvirus envelope would allow the virion to interact simultaneously with both raft and nonraft domains during attachment. Our observation that a significant fraction of PRV appears to localize juxtaposed to the lipid raft marker GM1 during entry is in line with such a partial or peripheral lipid raft association of alphaherpesviruses during entry. Perhaps, the periphery of lipid rafts, which forms the boundary between the cholesterol-rich rigid raft membrane and the more fluid phospholipidrich plasma membrane (El Kirat and Morandat, 2007) , may provide the most beneficial environment for penetration of the host cell. It is also possible that the weak or partial association of alphaherpesviruses with rafts during entry affects raft-associated signalling cascades, which may be involved in subsequent penetration. Although the current study points to an important role of cholesterol in PRV penetration and indicates a partial association of PRV with lipid rafts during entry, further research will be needed to fully clarify the exact physical role of lipid rafts and cholesterol during alphaherpesvirus entry.",
