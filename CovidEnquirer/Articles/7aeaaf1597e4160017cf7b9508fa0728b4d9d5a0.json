A retrospective case series was performed based on positive real-time quantitative PCR results for ECoV on faeces from horses treated at the UC Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital from 1 March 2012 to 31 March 2018. Horses negative for ECoV were matched to the ECoV-positive group as controls. Data collected included signalment, history, exam findings, diagnostics, treatment, and follow-up.",

Disease outbreaks have been reported in adult horses in boarding stables or competitive facilities across the United States, Europe, and Japan (Oue et al., 2013; Pusterla et al., 2013; Miszczak et al., 2014; Pusterla et al., 2018) . The recent increase in positive cases likely reflects increased awareness of the virus, and increased availability and timeliness of testing through fecal real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) (Pusterla et al., 2013) . Many cases of ECoV are self-limiting with transient clinical signs, however fatalities, endotoxemia and hyperammonemia can occur (Fielding et al., 2015) . Miniature horses may be more susceptible to severe disease and had a higher fatality rate in an outbreak (Fielding et al., 2015) . In contrast, foals <1 year of age do not seem to be clinically affected as frequently as adult horses, and ECoV is often present as a co-infection with other gastrointestinal pathogens in foals .",

Additionally, the diarrhea qPCR panel and salmonella fecal culture performed are considered sensitive screening tools for other infectious gastrointestinal pathogens. Thus, with the exception of the co-morbidities found, disease presentations observed in our equine patients are considered likely associated with ECoV infection. However, horses can shed ECoV subclinically and intermittently, and causation between clinical signs and fecal qPCR positivity for ECoV cannot be claimed. Furthermore, diagnostics performed were based on clinical findings and case progression and were often incomplete in ruling out additional pathogens (e.g. 11/33 positive for ECoV had respiratory qPCR panels performed). There is the potential for co-infections to have been underrepresented and their contribution to clinical signs unaccounted for. The likelihood of false negative results in horses tested for multiple pathogens through qPCR is considered relatively low unless the pathogen is shed intermittently, as qPCR is known to have high sensitivity and specificity for identifying and quantifying genetic material if present. If anything, the likelihood of identifying pathogens that might be present but not toxigenic may be a risk if qPCR is the sole test utilised (e.g. C. difficile toxin gene positive on qPCR but not elaborating toxin).",

This result is not surprising since submitting fecal samples for qPCR on horses that present with fever, colic, or loose manure is one of the first steps performed at the hospital as part of the diagnostic plan and for infectious disease control. Horses positive for ECoV had significantly lower WBC, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts than the negative controls, suggesting a more florid acute inflammatory response in those with ECoV. The majority of the biochemistry abnormalities in both the ECoV-positive and ECoV-negative groups can be explained by inappetance leading to decreased electrolyte intake and possible electrolyte secretion into the gastrointestinal lumen. Metabolic derangements (e.g. hyperlipidemia) were also common and attributed to a negative energy balance, as well as systemic inflammation (Barsnick et al., 2014) . Ammonia concentrations were not evaluated in most of the ECoV cases and would have been interesting to document, as hyperammonemia is a reported complication of ECoV associated with higher mortality (Fielding et al., 2015) . The three horses that were evaluated for ammonia had concentrations within laboratory references. However, a horse positive for ECoV only with the highest ammonia concentration at 27.9 mmol/L showed a decrease to 10.7 mmol/L when measured 2 days later, possibly indicating a relative hyperammonemia. The fatality rate for all horses with ECoV was low at 3%, which is less than the reported 7% in one outbreak and 27% in another (Pusterla et al., 2013; Fielding et al., 2015) . Thus, prognosis can be considered good with appropriate supportive care even in more severe cases of ECoV, although owners should be warned about the possibility of complications and death, comparable to that seen in horses presenting for fever, lethargy or colic for other reasons.",

The reasons for co-infection with ECoV remain unknown. The authors speculate that ECoV allows for reduced colonisation resistance of the gastrointestinal microbiome or reduced immune function, permitting colonisation with pathogenic organisms like salmonellae, or allowing Actinobacillus equuli to translocate across the gut wall. As mentioned earlier, diagnostic testing to evaluate for the presence of co-infecting pathogens was not complete in many cases in this study, and further research is required prior to drawing conclusions about the impact ECoV and co-infections have on treatment and prognosis in adult horses.",

This is similar to studies where horses inoculated with infected faeces shed for >9 days, independent of clinical signs, or ranged in shedding from 5 to 9 days (Nemoto et al., 2014; Schaefer et al., 2018) . At the current hospital, clinicians tend to Table 4 Median (range) follow-up and admission complete blood cell counts in horses positive for equine coronavirus (ECoV) only by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and 13 control horses. Follow-ups occurred a median of 4 days (range, 2-14 days) and 3 days (range, 2-9 days) after hospital intake for ECoV-positive and control horses, respectively. retest faeces via fecal qPCR every 5-10 days to determine when the horse is no longer shedding. Horses positive for ECoV were hospitalised 2 days longer than ECoV-negative horses, which may reflect increased disease severity or the decision to hospitalise the horse until it was no longer infectious. This study is limited by its retrospective nature. As mentioned, the clinical signs and progression seen in the ECoV-positive cohort were identical to those observed after experimental inoculation, however a claim for causation cannot be made. The presence of viremia and/or seroconversion in addition to clinical signs and positive fecal qPCRs would provide stronger evidence that ECoV was responsible for the disease presentations seen (Nemoto et al., 2014; Kooijman et al., 2016) . There is currently no gold standard ante-mortem test for diagnosing ECoV, and qPCR appears to be the most sensitive diagnostic for detecting ECoV in faeces (Nemoto et al., 2015) . However, false negative fecal qPCR results remain possible if single samples are submitted early in the course of disease (fecal shedding can start 24 h after horses become febrile), and as intermittent shedding can occur (Nemoto et al., 2014; Schaefer et al., 2018) . In a clinic setting, many horses screened for gastrointestinal pathogens through fecal qPCR have tests performed at an isolated time point rather than serially due to cost purposes, including the control horses used in this study. There is the potential for control horses in the current study to have been misclassified as ECoV-negative when they were in fact positive, which may have impacted some of the statistical results.",

As horses were often presented on emergency, there was sometimes a lag between admission and blood work submission, with time for treatment to alter clinicopathological parameters.
