Lai and co-workers have demonstrated that MHV-infected cells contain a single RNA species of negative polarity which is genome length (198213) . This negative-strand RNA is thought to serve as the template for positive-strand mRNA synthesis. For mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), one of the most extensively studied coronaviruses, there are seven species of MHV-specific mRNA present in infected cells, the largest of which is indistinguishable from virion RNA (Leibowitz et a/., 1981; Lai et a/., 1981; Spaan et a/., 1981) . Structural analyses of these RNAs have shown them to make up a \"nested set\" with coterminal 3' ends (Leibowitz et al., 1981; Stern and Kennedy, 1980a,b; Lai et a/., 1981; Cheley et a/., 1981;  ' To whom requests for reprints should be addressed. Weiss and Leibowitz, 1983; Spaan et al., 1982) . A unique feature of coronavirus replication is the presence of a common leader sequence of about 70 bases at the 5' end of each message which is present only once (at the 5' end) in the virion RNA (Spaan et a/., 1983; Lai et al., 1983 Lai et al., , 1984 Baric et a/., 1985) . The mechanism of synthesis of all species of coronavirusspecific RNAs is largely unknown.",

Dennis and Brian (1982) have reported the presence of a membrane-associated polymerase activity in cytoplasmic extracts of TGEV-infected cells. A similar activity has been demonstrated to be present in extracts of MHV-infected cells (Brayton et al., 1982 (Brayton et al., , 1984 Mahey et a/., 1983) . Recently, Compton et al. (1987) have described a system based on an extract from lysolecithin-treated cells.

Further increases in the pH from 7.4 to 8.4 had a relatively small effect upon the activity, with the greatest portion of that increase occurring as the pH was changed from 7.6 to 8.0.

We reasoned that after permeabilization this enzyme might be competing with the MHV polymerase complex for ATP. If this hypothesis is true we felt that the addition on an inhibitor of the ATPase to the system might stimulate the MHV polymerase activity. This did appear to be the case. Ouabain at concentrations of 1 and 20 rig/ml increased the polymerase activity to 125 and 131% of that observed in controls. We could not increase the concentration of ATP above 1 mM to directly test the idea that ouabain exerted its stimulator-y effect on MHV polymerase activity by increasing the biologically effective ATP concentration in our reaction since concentrations of ATP greater than 1 mn/l caused the permeabilized cells to detach from the substrate and subsequently disintegrate. We therefore included ouabain at 1 rig/ml and aprotinin at 0.24 TIU/ml in all subsequent experiments.",

The signal with clones 118-8a and 414-8a was considerably weaker than the signal obtained with the other MHV-specific inserts. We attribute these differences in signal, at least in part, to the lower amount of these two inserts present in the gel (Fig. 4A ). This is also reflected in the relative signals obtained with the random-primed probe. The specificity of the hybridization reaction was confirmed by the lack of hybridization of MHV-infected permeabilized reaction product with an irrelevant plasmid insert (Fig. 4C , lane g) and the failure of permeabilized cell reaction products from mock-infected cells to hybridize with these MHV clones (data not shown). Additionally, the extent of hybridization of the reaction products from permeabilized MHV-infected cells to MHV cDNA clones bound to nitrocellulose circles was similar to that of RNA prepared by labeling intact MHVinfected cells with [32P]orthophosphate in the presence of actinomycin D (data not shown).",

This activity was characterized as to its requirements for mono-and divalent cations, requirements for an exogenous energy source, pH optimum, and its time of appearance during the course of infection. The RNA products synthesized in permeabilized cells were demonstrated to be MHV-specific by agarose gel electrophoresis. The purpose of the present work was to develop and characterize a system for studying the MHV-specific RNA polymerase that was more amenable to experimental manipulations than intact cells. To avoid difficulties in reproducing in vitro the intracellular environment which evolves during MHV infection we elected to pursue a path which would leave as much of the cell machinery in place as possible. The system we have developed has several advantages when compared to the cell-free systems developed by other workers. Although it is difficult to compare the relative efficiencies of different systems due to the different ways in which the experimental results have been presented, we can calculate the amount of RNA synthesized in our system. Using the optimized reaction conditions, one 35mm well of MHV-infected permeabilized cells incorporated about 900 fmol of UMP into MHV-specific RNA. This is estimated to be about fivefold more RNA synthesis on a per cell basis than that obtained from a cell-free extract prepared from permeabilized cells (Compton et a/., 1987) . Other workers using cell-free systems have reported yields on the basis of femtomoles of UMP/h/ mg protein (Dennis and Brian, 1982; Mahey et a/., 1983; Brayton et a/., 1982 Brayton et a/., , 1984 . These have been in the range of 150-400 fmol/hr/mg protein. One 35-mm well of MHV-infected 17CL-1 cells contains about 450 pg of protein, providing a yield on a per milligram basis which is approximately 1800 fmol of UMP/mg protein/ 40 min, a figure which makes it at least four times more efficient than the previously described cell-free systems. There are no data at this time to suggest that our system, or any other MHV polymerase assay, is capable of initiating the synthesis of new strands of RNA.",

All seven of the MHV mRNA species are made in approximately the same ratios as they are in vivo. This contrasts with truly cell-free systems in which the RNA products synthesized were not characterized as to the precise molecular species of RNA synthesized (Brayton et al., 1982 (Brayton et al., , 1984 Mahey et a/., 1983) or those in which the major product was genome length (Compton et al., 1987) . Although the reasons for this difference in the RNA products synthesized are unknown, a possible explanation for this observation is the loss of a soluble factor responsible for regulating MHV transcription during preparation of cellfree extracts. Other explanations are possible as well, and additional work is needed to identify putative factors needed for the appropriate regulation of MHV RNA synthesis.",
