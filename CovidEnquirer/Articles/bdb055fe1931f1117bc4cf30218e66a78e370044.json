Consistent clinicopathological abnormalities in the 4 calves presented for clinical evaluation included hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypoproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia, increased creatine phosphokinase activity, and proteinuria. Four calves ultimately were necropsied and all had histologic evidence of immune complex glomerulonephritis. Glomerulonephritis in these calves was hypothesized to have resulted from the interaction of passively acquired antibodies at birth and active immunization at 7 and 28 days of age with a Salmonella Typhimurium core antigen vaccine.",

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed with EnVision TM system (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, U.S.A.) and rabbit polyclonal bovine IgG antibody (GeneTex, Irvine, CA, U.S.A.) as the primary antibody. Immunohistochemistry revealed multifocally deposited IgG antibodies in the glomerular tufts (Fig. 4) . Electron microscopy and IHC findings were consistent with immune-complex associated glomerulonephritis and morphologically highly compatible with type I MPGN. In humans, type I MPGN is the most common and classical type of MPGN, often associated with idiopathic or systemic immune complex disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus or chronic infection [1, 11] . In an attempt to identify the antigen in the deposited immune complexes and given the history of administration of a S. Typhimurium-based core antigen vaccine and passively administered antibody against Salmonella, IHC was also performed with rabbit anti-Salmonella polyclonal antibodies obtained from the vaccine manufacturer, but was unsuccessful. This finding is not unexpected, however, because it is highly likely that the binding site for the anti-Salmonella antibody was already bound due to immune complex formation. These follow-up tests (transmission electron microscopy and IHC) were not performed on tissues with evidence of fibrinoid vasculitis.",

Immune complex glomerulonephritis in cattle is uncommon [2, 3, 8, 12, 14, 15] . Deposition of circulating immune complexes in the glomeruli is usually caused by persistent antigenemia and production of antibodies by the host in response to the infection [2, 3] , although in some cases no infectious cause is identified [8] . Persistent BVDV infection is reported [2, 12] as a cause of immune complex glomerulonephritis, but was ruled out in the four calves that were tested in this report. Production of antibodies in response to vaccination, followed by experimental challenge to Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides has also been reported to cause glomerulonephritis [7] . Most previously reported cases of immune complex glomerulonephritis were at least 18 months old with the youngest case being 2 months old [12] . Moreover, previous reports of glomerulonephritis in cattle are usually described as single cases, whereas over 50% (7/13) of this group of calves showed clinical signs and were euthanized or died, suggesting a common denominator related to management or environmental exposure. Embryos of the same genetic lineage raised in recipient cattle on other farms under different management did not exhibit clinical signs similar to these calves, suggesting this was not an inherited disorder. While a familial nephropathy has been reported in Japanese Black cattle [6] , only some of the previously reported histologic lesions, including thickening of the glomerular basement membrane and mesangial proliferation, were consistent with findings of the cases reported herein. In contrast to the cases reported here, the familial nephropathy cases had reduced numbers of glomeruli, interstitial fibrosis with inflammatory cell infiltration, clusters of atrophic and cystic tubules, and thickening of the tubular basement membrane [6] . Additionally, immunohistochemistry in familial nephropathy cases was reported to be negative for bovine IgG in the areas of mesangial proliferation [6] .",

Antithrombin activity was not measured in the current case series, but proteinuria leading to antithrombin loss could have played a role in the apparent hypercoagulability of Case 2. Additionally, inflammation and disseminated activation of coagulation in multifocal vasculitis can cause a hypercoagulable state. Subsequent disseminated intravascular coagulation may have been the culprit behind Case 1's thrombocytopenia and evidence of petechial and mucosal hemorrhage. Among previous reports of glomerulonephritis, M. mycoides subsp. mycoides was associated with pulmonary vasculitis [7] , but neither lesions of multifocal fibrinoid vasculitis nor clinical complications of thrombosis were described [2, 3, 8, 12, 14, 15] . The unique finding of multifocal fibrinoid vasculitis in 3 out of 4 calves reported here may be explained by the suspected pathogenesis in these cases that resulted in different kinetics of immune complex formation and deposition in tissues.",

            "text": "It is hypothesized that the combination of 1) passively administered antibodies in colostrum given at birth from cows vaccinated with a S. Typhimurium-based core antigen vaccine, 2) administration of hyperimmune serum containing antibodies to S. Typhimurium subcutaneously within 24 hr of birth, and 3) active immunization of the calves at 7 and 28 days of age with the same S. Typhimurium-based core antigen vaccine administered to their dams likely caused a very high concentration of antigen-antibody complexes, which were deposited in the glomeruli resulting in MPGN. Antigen-antibody complexes could also have resulted from a combination of colostral antibodies and immunization against IBR and PI-3; however this vaccine was administered only once making the theory of excess antibody-antigen less likely than for S. Typhimurium. Recent studies have described calves' responses to vaccination against respiratory pathogens as early as 2 to 4 weeks of age in the face of maternal antibodies and no adverse effects associated with vaccination were reported [4, 5, 13] . On the other hand, glomerulonephritis was reported following vaccination against M. mycoides subsp. mycoides, with the difference being that antibodies and antigens resulted from active immunization and challenge with M. mycoides subsp. mycoides, respectively [7] . Notably, in the cases reported herein, the same S. Typhimurium-based core antigen vaccine was used to vaccinate the dams and the calves and likely resulted in colostral antibodies highly specific for the same vaccine antigen administered to the calves. The calves also received an injectable anti-sera which contained antibodies to S. Typhimurium. The peak occurrence of disease was shortly after the second dose of the core antigen vaccine (Table 1) . Persistent antigenemia from natural exposure to a pathogen can cause MPGN, but no common pathogen was identified in the necropsied calves. The IHC for S. Typhimurium antigen in the glomerulus was negative, which, as explained above, is not unexpected. In hindsight, serology on some or all of the calves to quantify antibodies to S. Typhimurium in circulation doi: 10.1292/jvms.17-0544 could have also been performed to at least demonstrate antibody acquisition from colostrum or the hyperimmune serum. However, even if detected it would not have definitively proven that the immune complexes were S. Typhimurium in origin.",

However, it is plausible that IV fluid therapy provided support of renal perfusion. It is unknown if any other treatment(s) could have improved the outcome. However, based on the hypothesis that the immune complexes were the result of the interaction of passively acquired antibodies and active immunization, it is postulated that the high morbidity could have been avoided by delaying vaccine administration until at least 21 days after administration of the hyperimmune serum. The label on the hyperimmune serum (Quatracon-2X; Boehringer Ingelhein Vetmedica) specifically cautions not to vaccinate with other viral and bacterial vaccines until 21 days after administration.",
