This report describes the construction and characterisation of a recombinant vaccinia virus designed to express modtfied forms of the E6 and E7 proteins from HPV16 and HPVl8, the viruses most commonly associated with cervical cancer. The recombinant virus (designated TA-HPV) was based on the Wyeth vaccine strain of vaccinia, and was shown to express the desired gene products. Studies in mice indicated that the recombinant virus was less neurovirulent than the parental virus and was capable of inducing an HPV-spectftc CTL response. This pre-clinical evaluation has provided a basis for the initiation of human trials in cervical cancer patients. Copyright 0 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

            "text": "Over the past decade it has become increasingly clear that cervical cancer is closely linked to infection by certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV)'. This conclusion is based on several lines of evidence, including the observation that over 90% of cervical tumours contain HPV DNA. Over 60 different types of HPV have now been described, but only a limited number are associated with tumours. Of these \"oncogenic\" HPVs, the most commonly found are HPV16, which occurs in some 50-60\u00b0~ of tumours, and HPV18 which occurs in about 20-25% of cases2. A number of other HPVs are also found, albeit more rarely, and these include HPVs 31, 33, 35, 45, 52, 39 . Infection with these \"oncogenic\" viruses however, does not necessarily lead to tumour development. A substantial proportion of healthy women show evidence of infection, and the vast majority of these infections do not lead to malignant disease. It appears rather that the presence of these viruses in the genital tract may, over a long period of time predispose to the development of cervical cancer by providing one of the elements in a multi-stage process of tumourigenesis.",

In vitro studies have shown that the E6 and E7 genes from the oncogenic HPVs can immortalise cells in culture4q5, and both proteins are known to interact with and inhibit the activity of cellular proteins that control cell division; E7 binds to the cellular retinoblastoma (Rb) protein6,7 and E6 binds to cellular ~53~.

CTLs can destroy cells expressing foreign antigens through recognition of peptide fragments generated within the cell and transported to the cell surface and presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens\".

First, vaccinia virus was used on a massive scale as a vaccine against smallpox; hence a great deal of information is available about its safety in humans. Complications can occur as a result of vaccination3', but these are rare, occurring mainly in children who inadvertantly spread the virus to their eyes. Thus for treatment of cervical tumours, where the prognosis can be very poor, the potential benefits of this approach clearly outweigh the risks. The genome of vaccinia virus can be readily manipulated to incorporate additional DNA3 ', and infection with recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing heterologous antigens induces a variety of immune responses, including CTL, in both experimental animals and humans32. Finally recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing a variety of tumour-associated antigens, including those encoded by papillomaviruses, have been used successfully to provide protection against tumour growth in animal models'4.33-35.",

These genes are believed to contribute to the oncogenic process, and to be able to immortalise cells in culture. It is important therefore to consider the likelihood that vaccination with the recombinant virus could lead to long term expression of E6 and E7 that could result in cell transformation. Since vaccinia is a lytic virus that replicates in the cell cytoplasm and does not establish a state of persistence or latency, the possibility that a cell infected with a recombinant expressing E6 and E7 could survive to become tumorigenic is extremely small. Furthermore, the expression of heterologous DNA from the vaccinia genome is dependent upon specialist vaccinia promoters which differ substantially from normal mammalian cell promoters, and which rely on vacciniaencoded transcription components. It is therefore highly unlikely that DNA released from the recombinant vaccinia virus infected cells could be taken up by healthy cells leading to long term gene expression is also remote.",

Furthermore, since the majority of tumours contain DNA from either HPV16 or HPV18, we elected to include the E6 and E7 coding sequences from both virus types. To simplify the problem of expressing four different heterologous coding sequences within a single recombinant vaccinia virus, the E6 and E7 coding sequences were fused together by site-directed mutagenesis to create a single open reading frame for each virus type. Since the E7 gene lies immediately downstream of E6 on the genome of both HPV16 and HPV18, this was achieved by replacement of the E6 termination triplet with a four nucleotide sequence that removed the stop codon, and aligned the two reading frames. This created a simple fusion of the two coding sequences linked by the amino acid sequence Gly-Ile, for the HPV16 E6/E7 sequence, and Gly-Ile-Leu-Ser in the case of the HPV18 E6/E7 sequence [ Figure 1 (a) ].",

Thus for HPV16 E7, the codons for Glu24 and Cys26, which are known to be crucial for Rb binding, and which are conserved in a number of different Rb binding proteins3' were altered to glycine codons. Likewise in HPV18, the equivalent codons, Glu27 and Cys29 were altered to glycine codons. We confirmed that the changes introduced into the E7 coding sequences had indeed abolished Rb binding using a previously published procedure2'. The wild type E7 and modified E7 coding sequences of both the HPV16 and HPV18 were transcribed and translated in vitro in the presence of radiolabelled amino acids. The extracts were then mixed with unlabelled in vitro translated cellular Rb protein, and binding assessed by immunoprecipitation of radiolabelled HPV proteins using an anti-Rb monoclonal antibody [ Figure 2(b) ]. The presence of bands corresponding to the wild type HPV16 and HPV18 E7 proteins in lanes 1 and 3 respectively confirmed their capacity to bind Rb.

The coding sequences for the HPV16 E6/E7 fusion (from pIMS7.2) and HPV18 E6/E7 fusion (from pIMS8.2) were placed under the control of the vaccinia virus specific promoters H6 and ~7.5 respectively'5,'6. These were selected on the basis that they are known to operate at early as well as late times during virus infection; there have been reports that genes expressed only late in the vaccinia virus infection cycle fail to provoke MHC class I-restricted CTL responses39.",

To test this, we compared the growth properties of v9a. 1 with Wyeth in viva in a mouse model. Figure 7 (a) shows that the titres of the two viruses detectable in mouse lungs were similar at day 1 following intra-nasal infection, although lower titres of v9a.l were obtained at days 3 and 5; each virus was cleared from the lungs within 14 days of infection. These data suggest that insertion of the HPV gene cassette into the Wyeth genome did not substantially compromise virus growth. Comparison of the two viruses by intracranial inoculation however, indicated that the recombinant virus was substantially less neurovirulent than the parent Wyeth strain [ Figure 7 (b) ]; at the highest dose used (IO') pfu, only 1112 deaths occurred with v9a.1, whereas lo/12 of the Wyeth inoculated animals died. This difference in virulence was reproduced when immunosuppressed \"nude\" mice were infected with the two viruses (data not shown); once again the severity of disease (as determined by death, presence of vaccinia lesions and weight loss) was much greater for the Wyeth parent than for the recombinant virus. These results were unexpected, and so we compared the neurovirulence of the Wyeth strain directly with a \"sibling\" virus to TA-HPV, whose genetic composition should be identical except for the presence of the HPV expression cassette. This virus, designated \"vwt.1\" was generated during the second round of recombination to generate TA-HPV (Figure 4) . This experiment indicated that vwt.1 also had reduced neurovirulence properties after intra-cranial inoculation with respect to Wyeth (data not shown) suggesting that the difference was not due to the insertion of the HPV gene cassette, but rather reflected heterogeneity in the original Wyeth stock.",

Spleen cells were cultured in vitro in the presence of a synthetic peptide corresponding to a known epitope from HPV16 E7 iE7.49957) for H-2b restricted CTL in C57BL/6 mice' . . After 12 days in culture the resulting cell lines were tested for their ability to kill target cells pulsed with the HPV16 E7.49-57 peptide. Cell lines derived from TA-HPV or vE710 mice lysed histocompatible target cells (RMA) pulsed with the E7 49-57 peptide at equivalent levels, but did not lyse unpulsed target cells, or cells pulsed with the H-2b restricted CTL epitope from influenza virus NP.366 374. There was no lysis of any of the target cells by lines derived from spleens from unimmunised or Wyeth immunised mice (Figure 8a ). After culture for an additional 2 weeks, cell lines derived from the TA-HPV immunised mice were tested for their ability to recognise both peptide pulsed target cells, and also cells expressing HPV16 E7 following infection with recombinant vaccinia viruses (Figure 8b ). There was significant lysis of EL4 cells infected with TA-HPV or vE710, indicating that the CTLs generated by TA-HPV were capable of recognising the wild type HPV16 E7 sequence, after synthesis and processing within the target cells. Lysis of TA-HPV and vE710 infected target cells was less than that of cells pulsed with the E7.49-57 pulsed targets, probably as a result of a reduced epitope density at the cell surface, compared to peptide-pulsed target cells. There was no lysis of target cells infected with Wyeth strain vaccinia virus. In addition, CTL generated by immunisation with vE710 were capable of lysing target cells infected with TA-HPV (data not shown).",

The parent virus on which the construct was based is a well-characterised vaccine strain of vaccinia virus with an extensive history of use in humans. The recombinant HPV sequences inserted were modified to increase the safety margin likely to be associated with its use in humans. We showed that the recombinant virus carried HPV DNA in the expected configuration, and that the heterologous coding sequences were expressed successfully as protein products in infected cells. Animal model studies indicated that the recombinant virus had reduced neurovirulence properties compared to the parental Wyeth strain. Although intra-nasal inoculation of the recombinant produced somewhat lower titres than the parental virus, vaccination of mice with v9a.l led to the generation of HPV-specific CTLs.",

These studies have also shown that effective anti-tumour responses can be induced by vaccination even where the tumour cells themselves are poorly immunogenic. The goal of our work has been to develop an agent that can induce an aggressive anti-tumour response at the time of primary cervical cancer diagnosis to help clear residual tumour cells that remain after conventional therapy (surgery or radiotherapy). Success at this stage should help prevent or delay disease recurrence, and since recurrence is almost always fatal within a relatively short time, this would represent a major clinical advance. To this end we have recently carried out an initial clinical study in cervical cancer patients with the virus described in this report. The results of this study, which was designed primarily to evaluate the safety of the approach, and to assess HPV specific immune responses, in particular CTL activity, have been reported separately (Borysiewicz et al., submitted for publication).
