Study 2 uses in-depth interviews to investigate the factors intensifying or alleviating the negative impacts of these crisis events on tourism as well as factors contributing to post-events tourism recovery and growth. Results identify the varying levels of impacts caused by event type and other causative factors for negative impacts.

Both events that generate tourism flows (such as Olympic Games) and crisis events that hamper tourist arrivals (such as widespread epidemic disease) have been investigated so that relevant stakeholders could better understand their positive and negative impacts for strategic planning and destination adaptation purposes. Events that affect negatively on destinations are always termed as crisis events, and publications discussing the impact of crisis events on tourism demand and general destination economy significantly increased over the years (e.g., Goh & Law, 2002; Huang & Min, 2002) . The tourism industry could be vulnerable to external environmental changes and crisis events, and recovery could be fast or slow pertinent to a sophisticated interaction among source country, destination and event characteristics.",

Yet, the tourism literature in general has long neglected the political dimensions in tourism development (Hall, 2010) . Social and political events may affect the development of tourism. Discussions on the impact of political events are scarce in literature, although decision-makers in tourism should be more adept in understanding the impact of political dimensions of tourism development and be more sophisticated in their approach to crisis management caused by the political dimensions (Hall, 1994) . These decision-makers not only include key decision-makers in the destination country (or regions) but also those in the source country (i.e., tourist generating regions). The increasing number of multinational tourism enterprises that manifest in operation of the international tourism industry is also a key stakeholder in this space. Currently, most of the political risk studies explore actions or events within the destination country (Poirier, 1997) . Rarely literature examines actions from the source country. In addition, few studies have examined the impact of crisis events on the flow of Chinese international tourists to the destination countries and regions. Given the present scale and impact of Chinese outbound tourism on global tourism barometer, it is a timely and important topic for tourism scholars and professionals to study how political dimensions divert Chinese tourist flows.",

To find answers to research question 1, Study One employs a quantitative approach and uses the monthly data of Chinese travelers to Japan and South Korea to analyze and explore the impact of various crisis events (e.g., political events, natural disasters and other crisis events) on Chinese outbound flow to Japan and South Korea. To suggest answers to research questions 2 & 3, Study Two uses interviews with key informants (i.e., Chinese outbound tour operators) in light of the factors causative to the rise and fall of the outflows. By corroborating the findings from the two studies, this paper discusses the impacts of these crisis events against the many other factors that affect tourism demand to a destination. A framework is developed via this mixed approach to evaluate crisis events' impacts to aid strategic planning and post-event recovery. Although crisis events may not be predicted, their occurrence and post-event recovery schemes may be associated with some level of identifiable pattern. The effects of such events on tourism demand and strategies for recovery are to some extent predictable and manageable based on appropriate scenario analysis. Thus, it is of great value to study the impact of crisis events and post-events market recovery and growth. Such understandings will assist the source and destination countries adjust their policy and schemes and recover from the negative impact within a reasonable period. This will contribute to a long-term equilibrium between demand and economic-political fundamentals.",

            "text": "Tourist demand models indicate that macroeconomic variables such as income, relative prices, transportation cost, and exchange rates significantly influence tourist demand (e.g., Dritsakis, 2004) . Intervention factors related to political and economic events are incorporated to these demand models, such as terrorist attacks, economic crisis, and natural disasters. Literature concerning the impact of crisis events examines factors diminishing tourism in specific cases (e.g., Huang & Min, 2002) , the extent to which crisis events affect the tourism economy (e.g., Goh & Law, 2002) and recovery strategies and schemes (e.g., Campiranon, Scott, Laws, Prideaux, & Chon, 2007; Huang & Min, 2002) . Some scholars use qualitative analysis methods, for example, Goodrich (2002) analyzed the short-term effects of the \"9.11\" incident on US tourism; Okumus, Altinay & Arasli (2005) used the panel interviews to analyze the impact of the Turkish financial crisis on tourism in Northern Cyprus. More scholars use econometric models for the analyses of crisis event impact. Time-series data are typically used in these econometric models, as time-series data typically deal with tasks like clustering, similarity search, forecasting, prediction, classification, outlier detection and noise removal (Eilat & Einav, 2004) . Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average time-series model (ARIMA) have been widely used in analyzing time-series data for their accuracy and mathematical soundness (Song & Li, 2008) . Most these econometric studies are post-event analyses, which use data prior to, during, and after the event to compare a predicted and actual demand to estimate the effects of the event (Song & Li, 2008) . In achieving the estimation, ARIMA and variations of the technique, such as Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), are widely used. For example, Huang and Min (2002) assessed the earthquake impact in tourism in Taiwan, and Min (2005) investigated the effect of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) on tourism demand in Taiwan. Both used ARIMA models. Chang and Liao (2010) used SARIMA model to predict the scale of Taiwan's travel to Hong Kong, Japan and the United State. Lim and McAleer (2005) used the ARIMA model to analyze the seasonal characteristics of Japanese tourists to Australia. Koc and Altinay (2007) used the X-12-ARIMA model and the TRAMO/ SEATS model to analyze the seasonal variation of per capita tourism expenditures in Turkey's inbound tourism from the perspective of market segmentations.",

The system covers factors from different perspectives, e.g., the tourists' perspective, destination perspective, and the integration of the tourism industry development of both the source market and the destinations. From tourists' perspective, destination risk and fashion are quite important for destination choice (Eilat & Einav, 2004) . Fluctuation in bilateral trade over time for a given pair of countries are uncorrelated with fluctuations in international tourism (Eilat & Einav, 2004 ). Yet, political, economic, security, military, and cultural forcesall of which function to promote or inhibit tourist flows from China to the destination countries and regions. In the context of Chinese outflow to Japan and South Korea, cultural and human exchanges (e.g., media, pop culture, entertainment industry) between the countries has evolved in multidimensional and multichannel forms. Japanese and Korean pop culture, in particular, are popular in China. These exchanges in trade and culture, and power balance in the negotiation of the exchanges, have not been included in the analyses of the impact of crisis events on tourism or post events recovery and growth. As Fig. 1 indicates, there is a phenomenal and steadfast growth of the total number of Chinese travellers to Japan from 2005 to 2017, although the curve in both growth rate and total visitor numbers reveal market volatility within the period. From 2005 to 2009, the average annual growth rate was relatively high (e.g., 15.8%). There was a slight decrease in 2008 and 2009. Year 2010, however, saw the highest growth rate (i.e., 52.9%). The first half of 2011 saw a sharp reduce of Chinese tourists; however, the latter half of 2011 once again experienced skyrocketed growth, which continued to midyear 2012. The period from September 2012 to mid-year 2013 witnessed a sharp drop in Chinese to Japan in both growth rate and the total visitor numbers. From September 2013, Chinese travelling to Japan experienced another explosive growth. After 2016, the growth rate slowed down, but the total visitation number reached to a new height, and Chinese tourists became the biggest spenders of all international tourists to Japan (Liu, ",

S represents the seasonal element, which is a cyclical change that occurs repeatedly every year. The period is 12 months or 4 quarters, and I represents irregular elements. The second stage is the identification of outliers. Among them, the LS (Level Shift) outlier indicates that a crisis event has the greatest influence on the time series with the longest impact duration, which often affects the trend -cyclic component, and has a fundamental and lasting impact on the business activities of the tourist destination. However, it does not affect the irregular factors and seasonal factors in the sequence decomposition. The TC (Temporary Change) outliers represent the impact of a crisis event inferior to the LS outliers. The TC outliers do not affect the trend-cycle components, often affecting only the irregular components. In addition, the AO (Additive Outlier) outliers caused by a crisis event often only affect the irregular factors, but the impact period is very short. It often appears as a single jump point in the time series, because its influence level will not disturb the normal operation of the tourist destination. Study One aims to determine the crisis events affecting Chinese outbound travels based on the types of outliers extracted from the seasonal adjustment model. In the estimation, Level Shift (LS) and temporary outlier (TC) are analyzed but AO outliers were excluded.",

The estimated value is added or multiplied to the corresponding unaffected component to obtain an estimated range of the natural trend curve. The loss estimate is performed accordingly. When an outlier is TC, the impact of a crisis is attributable to the irregular factors and has no effect on the trend and the seasonality. Therefore, an irregularity factor is checked to determine if it has a normal characteristic, and the interval is estimated for each month of the year in which the crisis has not occurred. This interval is the normal variation range of the irregular factor without the crisis event. Add or multiply this interval to the trend and seasonal data to get the interval estimate of the background line, If an outlier is LS, the impact comes down to the trend factor, and has no effect on the seasonal and irregular factors. Therefore, there is a need to re-estimate trends that are not affected by crisis events. The pre-crisis data are usually used to predict the trend at the time of crisis, and then the background is determined according to the seasonal adjustment model and irregular seasonal factors. During the computation, data with an average loss rate of less than 5% are excluded from the impact period. The \"nbdemetra\" software developed by the European Union Statistics Center was used for the computation.",

However, with the development of information technology and increased monopoly of organized tours by big tour companies via charter planes and bulk purchasing for new destinations, there is a trend that destination development becomes more synchronized. That is, tourists throughout the country, regardless of their region of residence, could be mobilized to visit emerging trendy destinations. This is especially true for short-haul destinations where charter planes are easily manageable. One informant commented:",

            "text": "Using both quantitative and qualitative approaches, this paper tested the impact of five major crisis events affecting the flow of Chinese tourists to Japan and South Korea from 2005 to 2017 and tried to explore why destinations suffer or recover at a different pace. Political crisis events at the national level had demonstrated a greater impact concerning both the intensity and duration than natural disasters, epidemic disease and financial crisis. South Korean's tourism industry was still reeling from the THAAD turmoil by the end of 2017 and beyond. The findings suggest that long-term political tension may exert the most negative impact on tourism development. The impact of political tension varies based on the level of involvement of the X.C. Jin, et al. Tourism Management 74 (2019) 334-344 governance bodies in regulating tour business operations and managing social influence. Results show that sound international relations are important for bilateral tourist flows and development of tourism. When international relations deteriorate, the tourism industry is more likely to be adversely impacted than other exports and trades, resulting in the loss of economic gains for the host country as well as the tourism businesses of the source country. Governments need to maintain a sound bilateral political relation for the development of tourism. This paper also indicates the effect of convention and social media on managing social sentiment during and post crisis events, which echoes prior research such as Faulkner (2001) that the role of media can be crucial in the impact of crisis on tourism. The results also indicate that, in various crisis contexts, tourists cancel their travel plans due to fear of health concerns, physical risk or social pressure. With other determinants of tourist demand remain constant, once the fear or pressure is vetoed, the potential source market will recover at a relatively rapid pace, as most tourists only temporarily lose interest in the destination country. In post crisis events recovery and growth, the travel industry infrastructure and structure at both the generating and destination regions, the status of the tourism products, and the attractiveness of the destinations all play important roles. It proves that destination government policy per se can have a significant impact on the directions of tourist outflows. Political, social, and cultural exchanges between the generating and destination regions, especially cultural export from the destination regions to the generating countries may assist in tourism development in the destinations. The paper posits that a severe crisis impact was created by the intertwine of the political, social and tourism systems. At the time of crisis, crisis management capabilities, timely positive publicity, and effective marketing campaigns will help to recover the potential source market in the affected region. At the post crisis stage, status and degrees of political, economic, social and cultural relations between the two regions largely determine the post crisis tourist flow. This raises significant questions as to the reactive nature of tourism versus the development of greater predictive capacity and theory generation.",
