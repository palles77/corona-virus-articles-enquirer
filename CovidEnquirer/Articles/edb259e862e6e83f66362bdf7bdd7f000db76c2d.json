To this end, numerous terminological systems (TSs) have been developed such as the International Classification of Disease Ninth Edition (ICD-9), 1 the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine, Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT), 2 Med-DRA, 3 LOINC, 4 Gene Ontology, 5 and the Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA). 6 A TS interrelates concepts of a particular domain and provides their terms and possibly their definitions and codes. 7 The increase in number of TSs is demonstrated by the growth of the UMLS Metathesaurus that now integrates 143 (UMLS 2007AB release) TSs. 8 Throughout different generations, these TSs have developed from single-purpose, inextensible systems to extensible multi-purpose systems. 9 Maintainers of medical TSs recognize that TSs are not static. Errors may be corrected and new concepts are added with the emergence of new diseases (e.g., the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)). Furthermore, terms denoting concepts and their usage change over time (e.g., for AIDS and HIV). Finally, some concepts (e.g., hysteria) go out of fashion or become obsolete as domain knowledge changes.",

Change operations that do affect the hierarchy, e.g., changes in concept definition or addition of concepts, are more complex because they must adhere to the constraints set by the change policy and often also lead to changes in existing concepts. Differences in the TS structure and content may lead to differences in allowable change operations within each TS. In general, for a TS that distinguishes concepts from terms, the change model includes addition, obsolete marking and amendments of the concepts, relationships and terms. 12 Additional change operations may be applicable to terminological systems based on their typology and content architecture (for example, if they provide cross mapping or composition rules). 19 The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Thesaurus for example uses a change model, that satisfies the change policies described above, and contains the following change operations: 59 \u2022 Retire concept, i.e., a concept is marked obsolete: previous taxonomic placement information is retained.",

The lack of specific literature and the fact that the framework prescribes the use of centralized maintenance model are the reasons that the use of semantic wikis as potential editing tools for TS maintenance was not specifically included in the framework or in the questionnaire.
