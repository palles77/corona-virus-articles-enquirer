Although mixing patterns are known to be crucial determinants for model outcome, researchers often rely on a priori contact assumptions with little or no empirical basis. We conducted a population-based prospective survey of mixing patterns in eight European countries using a common paper-diary methodology.",

We found that mixing patterns and contact characteristics were remarkably similar across different European countries. Contact patterns were highly assortative with age: schoolchildren and young adults in particular tended to mix with people of the same age. Contacts lasting at least one hour or occurring on a daily basis mostly involved physical contact, while short duration and infrequent contacts tended to be nonphysical. Contacts at home, school, or leisure were more likely to be physical than contacts at the workplace or while travelling. Preliminary modelling indicates that 5-to 19-year-olds are expected to suffer the highest incidence during the initial epidemic phase of an emerging infection transmitted through social contacts measured here when the population is completely susceptible.",

Both can be achieved by nonpharmaceutical interventions such as school closure, travel restrictions, and contact tracing, or by health-care interventions such as vaccination and use of antiviral or antibiotic agents [2, [10] [11] [12] [13] . Mathematical models of infectious disease transmission within and between population groups can help to predict the impact of such interventions and inform planning and decision making. Contact rates between individuals are often critical determinants of model outcomes [14] . However, few empirical studies have been conducted to determine the patterns of contact between and within groups and in different social settings.",

Instead, the contact structure for these infections has been assumed to follow a predetermined pattern governed by a small number of parameters that are then estimated using seroepidemiological data [19, 20] . A small number of studies have attempted to directly quantify such contact patterns, but they were conducted in small or nonrepresentative populations [14, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Hence, it is unclear to what extent the results can be generalized to an overall population and across different geographical areas. To address this lack of empirical knowledge, we present here results from, to our knowledge the first, large-scale, prospectively collected, populationbased survey of epidemiologically relevant social contact patterns. The study was conducted in eight different European countries using a common paper diary approach and covering all age groups. We use these data to assess how an emerging infection could spread in a wholly susceptible population if it were transmitted by the social contacts measured here.",

The confidence of a rule is the conditional probability P(YjX) indicating what percentage of times the rule holds and thus measuring the association between fX,X c g and fY,Y c g. Using both constraints, the set of rules can further be filtered by the lift, which is defined as the ratio of the relative frequency of X \\ Y and the product of relative frequencies of X and Y. The lift can be interpreted as the ratio of the rule's observed support to the support expected under independence. Greater lift values indicate stronger associations. Additionally, a Chi-square test for the rulecorresponding two-by-two table consisting of cells X \\ Y, X c \\ Y, X \\ Y c , X c \\ Y c , where c refers to the complementing set of items, can be used to test statistical significance of the association.

We partition the population into 5 y age bands, and we group all individuals aged 70 y and older together. This process results in 15 age classes. We denote the number of at-risk contacts of an individual in age class j with individuals in age class i by k ij . We take k ij as proportional to the observed number of contacts (both physical and nonphysical) that a respondent in age band j makes with other individuals in age band i. The matrix with elements k ij is known in infectious disease epidemiology as the next generation matrix K [32] . The next generation matrix can be used to calculate the distribution of numbers of new cases in each generation of infection from any arbitrary initial number of introduced infections. For example, when infection is introduced by one single 65-y-old infected individual into a completely susceptible population, we can denote the number of initial cases in generation 0 by the vector x 0 \u00bc (0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0) T .

The proportion employed or in full-time education was fairly consistent across the eight countries; the other categories differed somewhat between countries. Figure S1 ). Analysis of the total number of reported contacts with a multiple regression model shows a consistent pattern of contact frequency by age, with a gradual rise in the number of contacts in children, a peak among 10-to 19-yolds, followed by a fall to a lower plateau in adults until the age of 50 and a sharp decrease after that age (Table 1) . Living in a larger household size was associated with higher number of reported contacts. Weekdays were associated with 30%-40% more contacts than Sundays. The influence of the country in which the survey was performed was also apparent ( Table 1) , even when adjusting for the main different recording formats we used in different countries (diary sizes and estimates of professional contacts) (see Table S3 ). The overdispersion parameter in the model was significantly different from zero, indicating the necessity to use a negative binomial model as opposed to a Poisson model.",

Contacts of long duration or of daily frequency were much more likely to involve physical contact. Approximately 70% of contacts made on a daily basis last in excess of an hour, whereas approximately 75% of contacts made with individuals who have never been contacted before lasted for less than 15 min. Approximately 75% of contacts at home and 50% of school and leisure contacts were physical, whereas only a third of contacts recorded in other settings were physical; approximately two-thirds of the persons contacted in multiple settings involved a contact at home, and so a high proportion were physical. Mining the contact data for frequency, duration, and type of contact based on association rules of maximum length 3 using thresholds of 0.5% (about 500 contacts) on the occurrence, positive dependence, and a 5% significance level on the Chi-square test of dependence resulted in a total of 99 rules of which 46 were of length 2 (see Table S4 ). 75% of the contacts lasting 4 h or more involved physical contact and occurred on a daily basis (83%), while 83% of the first-time contacts lasting less than 5 min were nonphysical. First time and occasional contacts mostly lasted less than 15 min (lift values 3.3 and 1.8, respectively) and, when nonphysical, this association was intensified (lift values 3.6 and 2.6, respectively). Whether contacts were physical or not did not influence the association between contacts lasting at least four hours and occurring on a daily basis nor did it influence the association between contacts lasting from five minutes up to one hour and occurring on a weekly or monthly basis. Physical contacts and contacts lasting 1-4 h were the only characteristics that were symmetric-that is, they had the same level of confidence in both directions (66% and 64%, respectively). Overall, 67% of all physical contacts lasted for at least 1, while 56% of all physical contacts occurred on a daily basis. All previously reported rules had high lift-values and were significant at the 1% significance level. Due to the high degree of correlation between physical contact and other measures of intimate contact, in the remainder of the paper we use physical contacts as a proxy measure for highintensity contacts.",

More than half of all reported contacts occur at home, at work, or at school. It is interesting to note, however, that on a population level the overall number of reported contacts made during leisure activities is very close to the number of reported contacts made at school. A higher proportion of physical contacts are made at home, and leisure settings are the second most frequently reported location for such high intensity contacts ( Figure 2B ). Figure 3 shows the average number of contacts reported per participant with individuals of different age groups for each of the eight countries for all reported ( Figure 3A ) and physical contacts ( Figure 3B ) only (full contact matrix data can be found in Table S5 ). Apart from the remarkable similarity of the general contact pattern structure in the different countries, three main features are apparent from the data. First, the dominant feature is the strong diagonal element: individuals in all age groups tend to mix assortatively (i.e., preferentially with others of similar age). This pattern is most pronounced in those aged 5-24 years, and least pronounced in those aged 55-69.",

The highest incidence occurs among schoolchildren (ranging from 5-to 9-y-olds in NL to 5-to 19-y-olds in IT), and a less pronounced second peak in incidence occurs among adults (ranging from 30-to 34-y-olds in PL to 40-to 44-y-olds in FI). The high incidence among school-aged children results from their high number of contacts relative to other groups, and their tendency to make contacts within their own age group. The tendency to contact others within the same age group could potentially lead to a slow dispersion of infection across age groups. However, the contacts outside age groups are often with others about 30-35 years older or younger, and this tendency results in fairly rapid dispersion of infection across all age groups. Therefore, the observed contact patterns reveal that schoolchildren drive the epidemic in all age groups during the initial phase of spread for infections transmitted by droplets and through close contacts.",

We took a number of different measures of ''closeness of contact,'' including duration and frequency of contact and whether skin-to-skin contact occurred. These measures correlated highly with each other, such that the longer-duration contacts tended to be frequent and to involve physical contact (and vice versa). More-intimate contacts are likely to carry a greater risk of transmission. Furthermore, these types of contact tend to occur in distinct social settings: the most-intimate contacts occur at home or in leisure settings, whereas the leastintimate tend to occur while travelling. Thus, the risk of infection in these settings can be inferred to vary. This variation has important implications for contact tracing during outbreaks of a new infection. Our results suggest that if efforts concentrate on locating contacts in the home, school, workplace, and leisure settings, on average more than 80% of all contacts would be found. We have used simulations to expand on two particular types of contacts (physical and nonphysical) and to sketch the consequences of the observed contact patterns on the age distribution of incidence in the initial phase of an epidemic, when a new infectious disease is introduced into a completely susceptible population. As shown clearly by our simulations, the highest incidence of infection will occur among the younger age classes (5-19 y) for all countries. It is tempting to link such contact patterns to the observation during the 1957 Asian influenza A H2N2 pandemic that the first few generations of infection primarily affected those aged 11-18 y [35] . However, we note that our survey did not address the clustering of contacts; such clustering of contacts might result in less-pronounced differences in age-specific incidence than suggested by our calculations. Addressing the frequency of clustered contacts, duration and type of contact, differential impact of pathogen on different age groups, time correlation of contacts, and assortative mixing by demographic factors other than age should be key priorities for future research.",

Similarly, our framework does not apply to pathogens that, in addition to the respiratory route, can be also spread by other means, for example, the sewage contamination events for SARS [8] . Although we believe that it is plausible that the contact patterns observed in our study are predictive of disease transmission, further work is clearly needed to establish the types of contacts that represent transmission risks for different diseases and to determine the circumstances under which lower-intensity contacts could be epidemiologically relevant. The data reported in this study should not be considered a substitute for epidemiological studies that quantify, for instance, the intensity of transmission of influenza in households, schools, or other settings. However, this study does provide invaluable data on the relative importance of ''leisure'' and ''other'' contacts, which are very difficult to assess in other ways, and it highlights the relatively small contribution of personal contacts during travel based on our approach of defining a contact.",

The latter might be particularly useful in assessing contacts of young children who spend time in daycare centres and kindergartens, because parental proxy reporting for young children is likely to be problematic. Despite the limitations of self-reported egocentric data [36] , contact diaries can provide extensive details regarding contact structures and have been used successfully for social network analysis [37] . Our contact diaries yielded detailed information about intimacy, frequency, and epidemiological relevance of contacts with an acceptable burden on respondents. In five countries, participants were given the opportunity to report whether they had any problems filling in the diary. The low proportion reporting problems (4% in adults, 4.9% in older children self-reporting contacts, and 4.9% in parents as proxy for children) suggest that the contact diary was readily accepted and understood by responding participants.",

            "text": "A further limitation of our study is that the comparison of contact patterns between countries is complicated by the variations of diary design (see Table S1 ), recruitment, and follow-up methodology (see Table S1 ). Our surveys were conducted in each country by different commercial companies with different recruitment and follow-up methods. Conducting surveys on contact behaviour and networks that entail a certain burden on participants and follow identical methodology in different countries is a challenging task, given that cultural factors in response also play a role. Further research is definitely warranted to determine optimal survey methodologies in different international settings, including developing countries, to improve comparability of contact data. Diaries used in BE, DE, FI, and NL instructed respondents not to record all of their professional contacts, but to provide an estimate if they had a lot of them. The reason for this instruction was to try to capture information from those people who make very large numbers of contacts (shop assistants and bus drivers, for instance), given that it might be very difficult or impossible for such people to fill out the full contact diary. This instruction may have lead to some underreporting of contact frequencies and thus have affected the distribution of age and circumstance of contacts for these four countries, although we have taken account of this possibility to some extent using a censored model. Additional analyses for these countries that combine and compare the estimated frequency of professional contacts with the diary data will provide additional insights about the number of contacts for all countries. The differences between diaries do not, however, affect the age-specific pattern, nor the similarity in age-specific patterns found across countries.",

These computer simulations of hypothetical scenarios help policymakers and others to anticipate possible patterns and consequences of the emergence of diseases, and to develop interventions to curb disease spread. Whether to prepare for an outbreak of infectious disease or to control an existing outbreak, models can help researchers and policy makers decide how to intervene. For example, they may decide to develop or stockpile vaccines or antibiotics, fund vaccination or screening programs, or mount health promotion campaigns to help citizens minimize their exposure to the infectious agent (e.g., handwashing, travel restrictions, or school closures).",

Mathematical models have tended to use contact rates (the number of other people that a person encounters per day) as one of their main elements in predicting the outcomes of epidemics. In the past, contact rates were not based on direct observations, but were assumed to follow a certain pattern and calibrated against other indirect data sources such as serological or case notification data. This study aimed to estimate contact rates directly by asking people who they have met during the course of one day. This allowed the researchers to study in more detail different patterns of contacts, such as those between different groups of people (such as age groups) and in different social settings. This is particularly important for respiratory diseases, which are spread through the air and by close contact with an infected individual or surface.",

The researchers wanted to examine the social contacts that people have in order to better understand how respiratory infections might spread. They recruited 7,290 people from eight European countries (Belgium, Germany, Finland, Great Britain, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, and Poland) to participate in their study. They asked the participants to fill out a diary that documented their physical and nonphysical contacts for a single day. Physical contacts included interactions such as a kiss or a handshake. Nonphysical contacts were situations such as a two-way conversation without skin-to-skin contact. Participants detailed the location and duration of each contact. Diaries also contained basic demographic information about the participant and the contact.",

There was a great deal of diversity among the contacts, which challenges the idea that contact rates alone provide a complete picture of transmission dynamics. The researchers identified varied types of contacts, duration of contacts, and mixing patterns. For example, children had more contacts than adults, and those living in larger households had more contacts. Weekdays resulted in more daily contacts than Sundays. More intense contacts (of longer duration or more frequent) tended to be physical. Approximately 70% of contacts made on a daily basis lasted longer than an hour, whereas three-quarters of contacts with people who were not previously known lasted less than 15 minutes. While mixing patterns were very similar across the eight countries, people of the same age tended to mix with each other.",

Understanding the patterning of social contacts-between and within groups, and in different social settings-shows how diverse contacts and mixing between individuals really are.
