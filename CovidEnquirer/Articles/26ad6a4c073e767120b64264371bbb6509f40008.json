            "text": "Latent tuberculosis is present in a third of the world's population, with the prevalence of active tuberculosis in many areas exceeding 700 cases per 100 000 of the population. 1 This global epidemic is fuelled by synergy with HIV, which is found in 40-70% of African patients with active tuberculosis. 1 Most deaths from tuberculosis are preventable by early diagnosis and treatment. 2 In areas of high prevalence, sputum smear microscopy is often the only available and aff ordable test, but at best achieves a sensitivity of 50-70%. Culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the diagnostic gold standard, is sensitive and specifi c in cases of smear-positive tuberculosis, but takes 2-6 weeks to yield a result and is not routinely used in countries with high prevalences of tuberculosis. In these areas, tuberculin skin tests are often insuffi ciently accurate to aid diagnosis, 3 and do not readily distinguish between contained infection and disease. Serological tests for tuberculosis have focused on detection of mycobacterial antigens and, like skin tests, can be confounded by crossreactivity with non-pathogenic mycobacteria or previous immunisation with BCG. 4 Recently developed tests based on DNA amplifi cation or interferon \u03b3 release are expensive and need particular expertise. 5 A cheap, accurate, and rapid diagnostic test for tuberculosis will have immense impact on the control of this disease. For example, a test yielding results within a few hours but with a sensitivity similar to that of existing tests such as sputum microscopy (which requires two or more clinic visits) would be a great advance because it would enable initiation of treatment at a single clinic visit.",

High throughput proteomic profi ling of serum has been revolutionised by recent advances in mass spectrometry, such as surface-enhanced laser desorption ionisation time of fl ight (SELDI-ToF) mass spectrometry. 6 The application of approaches based on machine learning to the problem of pattern recognition 7 makes it possible to identify diagnostic combinations of proteins (diagnostic signatures) embedded within such profi les. 8 Analysis of serum proteomic fi ngerprints has improved diagnostic accuracy for some cancers 6, 9, 10 and infections such as human African trypanosomiasis. 11 This approach has also been used in the search for novel biomarkers for severe acute respiratory syndrome 12 and intra-amniotic infections. 13 We assessed the potential of proteomic fi ngerprinting as a basis for diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis.",

Samples were applied to Q Ceramic HyperD spin columns (Ciphergen, 20 minutes), preequilibrated fi rst in Tris (50 mM, pH 9), followed by binding buff er. The 11\u00b75 kDa and 13\u00b77 kDa biomarkers were eluted from the spin column in elution buff er (50 mM sodium citrate, 0\u00b71% octyl glucopyranoside, pH 3) and selective enrichment was confi rmed by SELDI-ToF MS. The biomarkers were resolved by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE, 4-12% Bis-Tris, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), stained with Coomassie blue, and excised from the gel. Gel pieces were washed three times in a mixture of ammonium bicarbonate (50 mM) and acetonitrile (50%), dehydrated in acetonitrile (100%) and dried. Proteins were subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion (15 min, room temperature) by the addition of trypsin (20 ng/\u00b5L) in acetonitrile (10%) and ammonium bicarbonate (25 mM), followed by incubation in ammonium bicarbonate (25 mM) for 4 h. Peptide mass fi ngerprints 16 of the digests were analysed by matrixassisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-fl ight (MALDI-ToF) mass spectrometry using 20% \u03b1-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid as matrix. The results of the in-gel tryptic digest were corroborated by tryptic digestion after passive elution of the protein from the gel. The peptide mass fi ngerprints were used to interrogate public databases with the MASCOT search engine. 17 The four selected biomarkers were measured in a regional protein reference laboratory at St George's Hospital with commercially available kits validated for clinical use. Neopterin was measured by competitive ELISA with a kit (ELItest Neopterin, BRAHMS Aktiengesellschaft, Hennigsdorf, Germany) in a Triturus analyser (Diagnostics Grifols SA, Barcelona, Spain). Rate nephelemetry was used for measurement of C-reactive protein, transthyretin (Beckmann Immage 800 analyser, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA) and serum amyloid A (N latex SAA, BN II analyser, Dade-Behring, Marburg, Germany).

The ability of the decision function to predict correct labels for unseen samples (test data) is known as its generalisation. Current machine learning methods, such as support vector machines (SVM), aim to optimise this property (webappendix). 18 The generalisation of a classifi er is dependent on a set of parameters (model) that must be chosen to optimise performance. For this purpose we adopted a grid search strategy in which a range of parameter values were used and tested using cross-validation. We used two cross-validation schemes. In k-fold cross-validation the training set is randomly split in k groups of equally distributed positive and negative cases. A classifi er is trained on k-1 of the groups and its generalisation performance is validated on the remaining group. This process is repeated k times, each time holding out a diff erent validation subset and the average represents the overall generalisation. In the second scheme, k-fold cross-validation with test, the data are fi rst randomly split into training and testing sets. A k-fold cross-validation is performed on the training set and the generalisation is obtained on the unseen testing set.",

Second, an SVM trained with just the 20 correlation-selected mass clusters achieved an accuracy of 89\u00b77% on the independent test set, indicating that these clusters contain most relevant discriminatory information. Information in remaining peak clusters (n=199) retained an inferior, though acceptable, diagnostic accuracy (85\u00b79%, fi gure 2A), indicating that there was substantial residual diagnostic information in the remaining peak clusters. We summarised the generalisation performance of the SVMs in ROC space with diff erent sets of mass clusters (fi gure 2A, webtable 1). The ROC convex hull (fi gure 2A, red line) is defi ned by two classifi ers (fi gure 2A, red square and green square). The highest specifi city (red square) was obtained with all peaks minus the ten that were positively correlated (209 in total), confi rming information value in negatively correlated peaks. The other optimal classifi er (fi gure 2A, green square) was obtained after using only ten positively and ten negatively correlated subsets of mass clusters. Using high-resolution mass-spectrometry after tryptic digestion, we identifi ed an 11\u00b75 kDa positive protein marker derived from serum amyloid A1 and a 13\u00b77 kDa negative protein marker derived from transthyretin (webfi gure 3). The molecular weight observed in the mass spectrum (13\u00b77 kDa) for the protein identifi ed as transthyretin corresponded closely to the theoretical value (13\u00b776 kDa) for this protein. However, that observed for serum amyloid A1 (11\u00b752 kDa) was 156 Da lower than its theoretical value (11\u00b768 kDa) suggesting that the protein was a variant of serum amyloid A1. To investigate the nature of this variant, the tryptic digest was analysed in more detail and was found to include a peptide at m/z 1551 that did not correspond to a tryptic peptide predicted from the full amino acid sequence of serum amyloid A1. It did, however, correspond to the 2-15 peptide (SFFSFLGEAFDGAR) that would have resulted from loss of the N-terminal arginine.",

These results provide proof-of-principle that a diagnostic approach based on a proteomic signature can be applied to tuberculosis. If our classifi er retained a similar diagnostic performance after validation in a population in an African tuberculosis clinic, where the prevalence of tuberculosis in patients presenting with respiratory symptoms might be around 10%, the positive and negative predictive values for our best classifi er would be 67% and 99%, respectively.

            "text": "However, although SELDI technology can provide a diagnostic test for tuberculosis that makes no previous assumptions about the identities of proteins constituting an informative signature, cost and complexity preclude its general use. We therefore identifi ed two of the 20 most discriminatory proteins to demonstrate the possibility of implementing more conventional diagnostic assays that are adaptable for fi eld use. These proteins (serum amyloid A and transthyretin), selected by Pearson correlation analysis and confi rmed by SVM classifi cation of proteomic signatures, have already been independently associated with pathophysiological processes in tuberculosis. Serum amyloid A is an acute phase protein that is associated with circulating high-density lipoprotein 33 and modulates lipid traffi cking and immune responses. It is the precursor protein in reactive amyloidosis, which complicates chronic tuberculosis in some individuals, and is a marker of disease activity in several infl ammatory states, including tuberculosis. 34 The ELISA assay used a commercially available antibody that recognises total serum amyloid A rather than the des-arginine subtype identifi ed in the signature. Specifi c detection of this variant might further enhance diagnostic discrimination. Transthyretin is a 55 kDa homotetramer in serum and a major transporter of thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine, as well as vitamin A (retinol or trans-retinoic acid) through association with retinol-binding protein. 35 Retinoic acid stimulates monocyte diff erentiation and inhibits multiplication of M tuberculosis in human macrophages. 36 Low levels of vitamin A, correlating with reduced transthyretin and raised concentrations of C-reactive protein, have been reported in patients with tuberculosis. 37, 38 A truncated form of transthyretin is a negative marker in proteomic fi ngerprinting studies on ovarian cancer; 39 serum amyloid A is a positive marker in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 12 and indicates relapse in nasopharyngeal cancer. 40 Artefacts associated with collection and handling of samples or spectrum generation could create spurious classifi cations. Although collection biases were diffi cult to control because we also used archived samples, we sought to minimise postcollection bias by interspersing the processing of samples from cases and controls over months and by using samples from four geographical sites and with varying HIV serostatus. Another possible source of bias is the predominance of African patients in the tuberculosis group and white people in the controls. However, at least 58 of 170 controls were of sub-Saharan African origin. It is possible, although unlikely, that our classifi ers detect the presence of tuberculosis infection rather than active disease. Tuberculin skin-test reactivity (as a questionable marker of latent tuberculosis) was not available for most control patients, but a substantial minority of the African and Asian control patients were probably latently infected. Moreover, the eff ectiveness of the classifi er on the basis of the four biomarkers (three of which are infl ammatory markers), provides evidence against discrimination between the groups on the basis of quiescent tuberculosis. Notably, of the fi ve patients with tuberculosis misclassifi ed by the SVM, three were Ugandan, whereas of the four misclassifi ed controls, two were white. The diverse pathologies in the control group are also likely to have made correct classifi cation more diffi cult. Furthermore, the fi ndings are unlikely to have been biased by systematic diff erences in concurrent drug treatment, because only 12 of the patients with tuberculosis had started chemotherapy at the time of recruitment.",

We therefore applied our trained classifi er to a second, independent dataset that was collected prospectively at a later date in the UK, over 4 months. Patients in this dataset were more closely matched for ethnic origin and included a greater proportion of controls with respiratory disease than in the training set. All samples in the test set were processed with precisely the same standard operating protocol. The fact that the diagnostic performance of the classifi ers survived rigorous testing in this new set strengthens the conclusions of the fi rst part of the study. The small decrease in diagnostic accuracy might be at least partly attributable to the small size of the second dataset, and might also refl ect the existence of some biases in the fi rst dataset. The limitations of the SELDI-ToF platform with respect to reproducibility in peak intensity might also have an eff ect. For example, although we found average interassay coeffi cients of variation of about 24% for nine universally present peaks in our quality control spectra, there may be larger variations in low intensity peaks residing closer to noise. This suggestion is consistent with maintenance of greater diagnostic accuracy across two datasets seen with inherently less variable immunological assays, and strengthens diagnostic approaches that use two independent assays. A key advantage of SELDI-ToF MS lies in the discovery phase, which can profi le large numbers of samples in a high throughput fashion, and by using whole signatures, reduce problems with individual variability in peak detection.",

            "text": "Although single protein markers might have insuffi cient accuracy in the diagnosis of tuberculosis, the use of proteome-guided analysis combined with machine learning methods such as SVMs can achieve better accuracy than that of current standard methods. These fi ndings suggest that markers with low individual diagnostic specifi cities can boost diagnostic yields when used in particular combinations. In some cases, truncated or fragmented derivatives of common plasma proteins might be more specifi c markers of some diseases and arise by proteolytic enzyme induction characteristic of defi ned disease states. 41 For example, the des-arginine variant of serum amyloid A we identifi ed might be more specifi c than other variants for tuberculosis. Similarly, truncated forms of another apparently non-specifi c acute-phase protein, \u03b11-antitrypsin, have been reported as relatively specifi c markers in SARS. 12 Thus, a possible explanation for the apparent paradox that seemingly non-specifi c acute-phase proteins could provide diagnostic specifi city for particular infections, is the possibility of disease-specifi c modifi cation of common proteins, as has been proposed for several cancers. 8 Preservation of high diagnostic accuracy when translating from proteomic signatures to immunoassays, and the plausible disease-association of the identifi ed biomarkers, establishes the value of SVM classifi ers for diagnosis of tuberculosis and provides strong evidence to support the use of serological testing. Although we have shown reasonable diagnostic accuracies based on a subset of four biomarkers as an illustration of the principle, better classifi ers might ultimately require use of a larger number of biomarkers. To adapt the test for fi eld use, antibodies to panels of defi ned biomarkers could be incorporated into dipstick-type formats, and patterns analysed with trained SVM classifi ers on personal computers. These tests can then be applied to longitudinal studies of tuberculosis and other diffi cult diagnostic categories, such as sputum-negative tuberculosis, extrapulmonary cases, and paediatric infections.",
