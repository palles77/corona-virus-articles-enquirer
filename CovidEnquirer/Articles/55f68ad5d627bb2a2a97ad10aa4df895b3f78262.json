A definition was developed for suspected and probable SARS cases, based on clinical and epidemiological criteria; it has since been modified on several occasions. While SARS demonstrated very vividly that in the modern world with an enormous volume of intercontinental traffic, infectious agents may be spread rapidly across the globe, it also serves as an example of how modern technologyprovided there is the necessary will, determination, and coordination to make best use of it-may help in combating such threats with unprecedented speed and enormous success. SARS is characterized clinically by fever followed by respiratory signs and symptoms which may lead to rapidly progressive respiratory failure. As of September 2003, 8098 people have been notified to the World Health Organization (WHO) as fulfilling the criteria for \"probable SARS\", and of these, 774 have died from SARS (http://www.who.int/csr/ sars/country/2003 08 15/en/).",

However, further investigations did not confirm these findings; the said agents were indeed found in a number of SARS patients but not in all (WHO multicentre collaborative networks for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) diagnosis, 2003). Almost nobody knew at that stage that virologists in Beijing had already discovered a new virus in samples from some of the earliest SARS patients. However, the official line in China at the time was that the novel \"atypical pneumonia\" was caused by Chlamydia (Enserink, 2003a) . Nevertheless, before the end of March, laboratories in Hong Kong, Germany, Canada, and the United States of America found evidence of a novel coronavirus in patients with SARS by cell culture, electron microscopy, and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers at low stringency designed for other agents followed by sequencing (Peiris et al., 2003b; Drosten et al., 2003a; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Poutanen et al., 2003; Drosten et al., 2003b) . These results could not rule out that very thorough and extensive testing had by chance led to the discovery of a novel agent that was not responsible for the new illness but rather an \"innocent bystander\". However, the sequences obtained in different parts of the world were shown to belong to the same, previously unrecognised, coronavirus (Ruan et al., 2003) . It could also be shown that SARS patients underwent seroconversion against this coronavirus, using cells infected with patient isolates as antigen for indirect immunofluorescent antibody tests (Drosten et al., 2003a; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Fig. 1) . Furthermore, no evidence of present or past infection with this agent could be detected in limited surveys of healthy control individuals not suffering from SARS (Ksiazek et al., 2003) . This strengthened the case for the novel coronavirus being the cause of SARS, but only after it had been shown to cause a similar illness in artificially infected macaques could it be regarded as fulfilling all four of Koch's postulates ; World Health Organisation Multicentre Collaborative Networks for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Diagnosis, 2003) . On April 16, 2003, less than a month after the laboratory network had been brought into existence, WHO officially announced that a new coronavirus, never before seen in humans or animals and now provisionally termed SARS-associated coronavirus (abbreviated as SARS-CoV), was the cause of SARS .",

Most but not all viral particles display the characteristic appearance of surface projections, giving rise to the virus family's name (corona, Latin, = crown). They have the largest genomes of all RNA viruses. Based on their unique transcription strategy that involves the formation of \"nested\" mRNA molecules (Cavanagh, 2000) . Within the Coronaviridae, the genera Torovirus and Coronavirus (type species: infectious bronchitis virus, IBV) are distinguished. A unique feature of coronavirus genetics is a high frequency of RNA recombination as a result of discontinuous transcription and polymerase \"jumping\" (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997) . One example is the porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV), which evolved in the early 1980s from the enteropathogenic porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), known since the 1940s (Pensaert et al., 1986) . Through a large deletion in the S gene, the virus acquired an altered tissue tropism, causing mild respiratory infections. Based on homologies on the amino acid sequence level, the known coronaviruses can be divided into three groups. Table 1 gives an overview of coronavirus species, group assignment, host species, disease manifestation and availability of a vaccine. There are more than a dozen known coronaviruses affecting different animal species; whereas group I and II coronaviruses affect various mammals, those in group III infect birds. Some of these cause major problems in the livestock industry or may affect companion animals; therefore, considerable efforts have been devoted to their control, including development of active immunisation.",

The sequence analysis of SARS-CoV suggests that it is an animal virus with a still unknown natural host species that has recently developed the ability to productively infect humans. A genetically very close but not identical virus was found in wild animals (masked palm civets and a raccoon dog) from a wildlife market in Guangdong .

The first cases retrospectively identified as SARS occurred there in November 2002. Interestingly, amongst these early cases there seems to have been a significantly higher percentage of food handlers, chefs, etc. than in the general population, lending further support to a zoonotic origin. The worldwide spread of SARS-CoV was triggered through a single infected individual from Guangdong who spent some time in Hong Kong before succumbing to SARS (Chan-Yeung and Yu, 2003) . During that time he unwittingly infected several others that in turn gave rise to a series of outbreaks (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2003) . Through sometimes several generations of transmissions, this event carried the virus to different Hong Kong hospitals and communities as well as to Vietnam, Singapore, Canada, the United States of America, and beyond to a total of 30 countries and areas of the world (World Health Organization, 2003d). The virus travelled in infected humans and was passed on over several generations, as reflected in the genetic relatedness of isolates from these countries. Although China was late in admitting it, the SARS-CoV had unsurprisingly also been spread within mainland China; in the end, the worst affected area was the capital, Beijing, with 2521 cases in total, which surpasses the count for Guangdong with 1512 by far (World Health Organization Western Pacific Region, country office China: http://www.wpro.who.int/wr/chn/chn sars.asp).",

Shedding of SARS-CoV in faeces and urine also occurs but its significance is unknown. The duration of infectivity is still unclear. Faecal shedding seems to last for several weeks; this however does not necessarily mean that there is sufficient excretion of infectious viral particles to infect other individuals (Peiris et al., 2003a) . Practising stringent droplets and contact precaution significantly reduces the risk of infection after exposure to patients with SARS. Therefore, the protective role of the mask suggests that the main route of transmission is by droplets . SARS-CoV spreads more efficiently in sophisticated hospital settings. Evidence suggests that certain procedures, such as intubation under difficult circumstances and use of nebulizers increase the risk of infection .",

These \"super-spreaders\" were mostly very ill and often died from SARS, and invariably serious lapses in infection control precautions had occurred during their management. So far there is no evidence that differences in virus strains may be responsible for the \"super-spreader\" phenomenon. There is also no firm evidence suggesting that subsequent transmissions led to clinically less severe illness, possibly through attenuation of the virus. It is also unclear why children are relatively under-represented amongst SARS cases, and why on average they seem to suffer less severe SARS illness.",

SARS-CoV-specific RNA can be amplified from various clinical specimens, especially in respiratory secretions and in stool, by PCR. High concentrations of viral RNA of up to 100 million molecules per millilitre were found in sputum. Viral RNA was also detected, albeit at extremely low concentrations, in plasma during the acute phase and in faeces during the late convalescent phase, suggesting that virus may be shed in faeces for prolonged periods of time (Drosten et al., 2003a) .

The first type of antibody test to be employed was the immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Using cells infected with the patient's own virus isolate and an antihuman IgG:FITC conjugate, we were able to demonstrate specific seroconversion in the two Frankfurt SARS patients (Drosten et al., 2003a;  Fig. 1 ). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed that detects antibodies in the serum of SARS patients and reliably yields positive results at around day 21 after the onset of illness (World Health Organization Multicentre Collaborative Network for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Diagnosis, 2003). The neutralisation test (NT) assesses and quantifies, by means of titration, the ability of patient sera to neutralise the infectivity of SARS-CoV on cell culture; the NT titre may therefore be correlated to clinical immunity although this has yet to be demonstrated. However, NT is limited to institutions with BSL-3 facilities. The only antibody test commercially available so far is an IFA which yields a positive result from about day 10 after the onset of illness (Euroimmun, L\u00fcbeck, Germany). As the diagnosis of SARS is based entirely on a set of clinical and epidemiological criteria so far, reported case numbers are likely to include a substantial number of non-SARS patients. Therefore, recovered patients should be tested systematically for specific SARS-CoV antibody reactivity to confirm their diagnoses in retrospect and thus allow a better understanding of epidemiological and other features .",

The mechanism of glycyrrhizin's activity against SARS-CoV is unclear. Glycyrrhizin has previously been used to treat patients with HIV-1 and chronic hepatitis C virus . Interestingly, this compound may be contained in some of the herbal preparations widely used in SARS patients in China as part of traditional Chinese medicine (Lin et al., 2003) . Furthermore, interferons inhibit SARS-CoV in vitro. In a recent study (Cinatl et al., 2003b) , interferon \u00df was more potent than interferon \u2423 or \u2425. Therefore, it could become a drug of choice in future, alone or in combination with other antiviral drugs.",

Thanks to an internationally well-coordinated and in most cases timely and determined response no new cases of SARS have been notified since 15 June 2003. Several countries reported SARS cases imported from areas reporting outbreaks but did not experience secondary transmission; likewise, Vietnam was the first country to demonstrate that-through a combination of early detection and public alert followed by decisive public health action and often heroic efforts by individuals-further transmission could be curtailed (Reilley et al., 2003) .",

The case definitions, too, will need to be adjusted to a world without SARS; in theory, new cases are \"impossible\" as the criterion of an epidemiological link cannot be fulfilled. Precious time may therefore be lost before a reappearance is detected. Vigilance for SARS must clearly be maintained (see: Alert, verification and public health management of SARS in the post-outbreak period-14 August 2003-rationale for continued vigilance for SARS; http://www.who.int/csr/sars/postoutbreak/ en/). For this purpose, WHO has defined three geographical zones according to their presumed risk for a SARS recurrence: a potential zone of re-emergence, comprising Guangdong and other areas where animal-to-human of SARS-CoV might occur; nodal areas, comprising Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, Canada, and Taiwan, with sustained local transmission in spring 2003 or entry of numerous persons from the potential zone of re-emergence; and low risk areas. SARS-related vigilance should be staged according to the zone in which a particular area is situated; for low risk areas, surveillance should be for clusters of \"alert\" cases among health care workers, other hospital staff, patients and visitors in the same health care unit. A SARS Alert is defined as two or more health care workers or hospital-acquired illness in at least three individuals (health care workers and/or other hospital staff and/or patients and/or visitors) in the same unit fulfilling the clinical case definition of SARS and with onset of illness in the same 10-day period. In the other zones, this should be supplemented by enhanced surveillance, plus special studies for SARS-CoV infections in animal and human populations in the potential zone of re-emergence.",

Although an effective vaccine cannot be expected to be available soon, the relative ease with which SARS-CoV can be propagated in vitro is clearly helpful. A suitable animal model for SARS may be available in the form of cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) . While the availability of vaccines against animal coronaviruses, such as avian infectious bronchitis virus, transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus of pigs, and feline infectious peritonitis virus, is encouraging, the obvious lack of protective immunity in humans after infection with HCoV OC43 and 229E is not. There is also currently no commercial veterinary vaccine to prevent respiratory coronavirus infections, except for infectious bronchitis virus infections in chickens. Further research is also urgently needed to determine whether immune pathogenesis plays a r\u00f4le in SARS or whether immune enhancement may occur, the chances of developing an effective and safe vaccine therefore remain uncertain. It is to be hoped that after such an encouraging start in an atmosphere of open collaboration and mutual trust, progress in SARS-CoV research will not be impeded by patent matters (Gold, 2003) .",
