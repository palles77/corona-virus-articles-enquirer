New viral diseases continue to appear as a result of several changes in human activity: travel, population growth, interaction with wild habitats etc. Well-known novel, or emergent, RNA diseases include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (2), human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) (3), and may come to include Avian influenza H5N1 virus (4) . These emergent diseases are an important factor behind the increase in the number of genome sequences that NCBI treats as representing new species (Figure 1 ). In 2005, more than 200 new virus species were submitted to GenBank (more recent dates are less reliable because there is typically a delay between submission and public availability). As more emergent viruses appear, it is important to have a site that allows their genomes to be compared to those of known viruses. The origin of most major infectious diseases is unknown because of our ignorance of the diversity of pathogens in wild animals. This restricts our ability to both predict risks and develop treatments (5) .",

There are many Web sites that provide genomic data, tools for genetic analysis and/or biological information for some viruses (see 'Links' on our site home page). The RNA Virus Database is intended to complement these other sites by providing basic genomic information and tools for all RNA viruses and linking the user to more specialist sites, where they exist, e.g. for HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus (HCV), we provide links to sites such as the Los Alamos Laboratory on the main page for each of these viruses (find by typing HIV-1 or HCV into the search window in the top toolbar). For such viruses, we do not duplicate the work of other groups by attempting to display the available diversity of genomes. We intend that the RNA Virus Database should develop further as a hub for other sites and we therefore encourage other workers to contact us with details of their sites that they wish linked to ours. Also, we encourage workers to 'adopt a virus' and improve and/or expand the information that we provide for individual species. This can be done by emailing us or getting involved directly in developing the database, which is an Open Source project available at our GoogleCode site (http://code.google.com/p/rnavirusdb).",

These alignments were made by downloading from GenBank all complete (or near-complete) genomes using the BioPerl GenBank modules (11) . Accidental mismatches were excluded by performing a preliminary alignment using BlastAlign (12) , which is designed to cope with non-or poorly homologous sequences and reports such matches. The sequences that showed clear homology to the NCBI reference sequences (we used a cutoff of a maximum of 40% of positions being represented by gaps in the BlastAlign alignment), up to a maximum of 50, were then aligned using ClustalW (default parameter values) (13) . For species for which we have at least three sequences, a neighbor-joining tree was then constructed using PAUP (with HKY-adjusted genetic distances) (14) , and this tree is displayed both as a pdf [via the TreeGraph program (15) ] and using FigTree, which is a new Java-based tree-drawing application created by one of us (Rambaut,A., unpublished data).

For this we use NCBI's suite of BLAST programs (16) (go to the 'BLAST' link on the toolbar of the home page). Once the most closely related reference species has been located, the query sequence can then be placed into a whole-genome multiple alignment for that species (where such an alignment is present) in order to show the query's phylogenetic relationships to the genomes in our database (go to 'Align your sequence' on the virus species main page). An example of this process is illustrated in Figure 2 . Two procedures are available here for building the new multiple alignment. (i) A BLAST of the query to the reference species sequence provides coordinates from the resulting pair-wise alignment. These coordinates are then used to select homologous regions from the reference multiple alignment, and a new multiple alignment is then built using ClustalW along with a phylogenetic tree using PAUP as described above. (ii) BlastAlign (described above) is used to generate a new multiple alignment using the query sequence plus the sequences from the reference multiple alignment.",

We, therefore, allow the user to select from three possible options for dealing with this feature: (i) have overlapped regions excised from the translated genome, (ii) have one only of any overlapped amino acid sequences represented or (iii) have all the amino acids sequences present, with overlapped sequences placed sequentially (and thus the nucleotides represented twice).",

The PHP scripts can be accessed using subversion (http://sub version.tigris.org/) from our GoogleCode site at http:// code.google.com/p/rnavirusdb. The mySQL database (a gzipped 16 Mb dump) may also be downloaded from the same site for installation on the user's computer if required. A README with installation instructions is present among the PHP scripts. If required, the database can subsequently be updated by other users following instructions and Perl scripts given in the Supplementary Material (perl_scripts.tar). This updating involves a series of short intervening manual steps (we find that complete automation of such processes is inefficient).",
