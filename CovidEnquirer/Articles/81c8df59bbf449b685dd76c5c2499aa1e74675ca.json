In order to delineate the epitopes on H protein, fine epitope mapping and conservation analysis of linear Bcell epitopes (BCEs) on PPRV H has been undertaken using biosynthetic peptides and rabbit anti-PPRV H sera. Thirteen linear BCEs were identified and their corresponding minimal motifs were located on the H protein of PPRV China/Tibet/Geg/07-30. Conservation analysis indicated that two of the 13 minimal motifs were conserved among 52 PPRV strains. Nine of the 13 peptides containing the minimal motifs were recognized using anti-PPRV serum from a goat immunized with PPRV vaccine strain Nigeria 75/1. Identified epitopes and their motifs improve our understanding of the antigenic characteristics of PPRV H and provide a basis for the development of epitope-based diagnostic assays and multiple epitopes vaccine.",

Clinical symptoms associated with PPR include pyrexia, congestion of mucosal surfaces, ocular and nasal discharge, erosive stomatitis and diarrhea (Liang et al., 2016; Libeau, 2015) . As a notifiable disease listed by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), PPR has significant socioeconomic impact on poverty alleviation in developing countries, and the OIE together with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has launched a control and eradication strategy aimed at the global elimination of the disease by 2030. PPRVs have been classified into four lineages based on partial sequences of the nucleocapsid (N) or fusion (F) genes even though the virus is serologically monotypic. Until recently, these lineages have been associated with the geographic distribution of the virus. Lineages I, II and III were common in Africa and lineage IV in the Middle East and Asia (Adombi et al., 2016; Santhamani et al., 2016) . However, during the last decade, lineage IV viruses has been regularly reported in different African countries and appear to be spreading more efficiently within this continent (Adombi et al., 2016) .",

Following stimulation by the pathogen, B cell lymphocytes secrete neutralizing antibodies that are highly effective in clearing foreign invaders such as PPRV (Munir et al., 2013b) . Therefore, mapping B cell epitopes (BCEs) on the viral protein is a prerequisite for designing efficient recombinant multi-epitope vaccines. Furthermore, identification of epitopic domains in the PPRV structural proteins will facilitate the development of epidemiological surveillance methods to monitor the immune status of animals. BCE mapping is also helpful for advancing DIVA (differentiation of infected versus vaccinated animals) strategies.",

Although further effort is required to identify the epitopes on viral proteins, there have been several reports describing the antigenic regions of the PPRV H and N proteins (Choi et al., 2005; Dechamma et al., 2006; Renukaradhya et al., 2002) . Employing four different monoclonal antibodies and deletion mutants of PPRV H expressed in both Escherichia coli and mammalian cells (Renukaradhya et al., 2002) , B cell epitopic regions having neutralizing antibody binding capacities have been mapped to two regions of the PPRV H protein from 263 to 368 aa and 538 to 609 aa.

Biosynthetic peptides and polyclonal serum against PPRV N protein were employed in our previous study for fine epitope mapping and conservation analysis of linear B-cell epitopes on the PPRV N protein (Yu et al., 2015) . This strategy has now been adopted to identify 13 linear epitopes and their minimal motifs on the PPRV H protein. Our data increase our knowledge of BCE distribution on the PPRV H protein and provide a more solid foundation for the rational design of multiepitope based vaccines and diagnostic antigens.",

            "text": "For infection to occur, enveloped viruses must first interact with membrane protein receptors on the surface of host cells and induce fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell membrane. PPRV H protein binds to its cognate receptor on the host cell during the first step of the viral infection process, and acts as a major antigen that stimulates a protective immune response in the host (Renukaradhya and Shaila, 2015) . PPRV H protein has also been shown to be effective in inducing both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Recombinant vector viruses expressing H alone or combined with F, another PPRV glycoprotein, can induce high levels of antibodies and protect goats and sheep from experimental challenge with pathogenic PPRV (Caufour et al., 2014; Holzer et al., 2016) . However, multi-epitope based recombinant vaccines offer numerous advantages compared to the complete protein including cost-effective production, multi-valency, and stability under different conditions. Moreover, the efficacy of epitope vaccines can be further improved by combining CD4 + T helper and promiscuous epitopes, employing epitope enhancement techniques (such as immune-informatics or computational immunology), and adopting toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands as an adjuvant (Nezafat et al., 2014; Rosa et al., 2015) . Consequently, in order to enable rational multi-epitope vaccine and diagnostic antigen design, it is imperative to delineate the BCEs on the target antigens. Although Shaila and coworkers have identified two discontinuous B cell epitopic regions (aa 263-368 and 538-609) and three regions that include T cell determinants (aa 123-137, 407-416, and 242-609) on the PPRV H protein (Renukaradhya et al., 2002; Sinnathamby et al., 2001 Sinnathamby et al., , 2004 , the total number of BCEs (or TCEs) and the precise nature and location of their minimal motifs still need to be determined.",

Based on sequence comparisons among different PPRV strains, two of these motifs are conserved. Primary amino acid sequence alignment of the hemagglutinin from members of the genus Morbillivirus indicates that, as a type II membrane glycoprotein, the H protein is comprised of an N-terminal cytoplasmic tail (aa 1-35), a transmembrane region (aa 36-58), a stalk region (aa 59-154), and a C-terminal receptor-binding head domain (aa 155 to the terminus) (Colf et al., 2007; Hashiguchi et al., 2011a) . Accordingly, the two conserved motifs shown in Fig. 4 were located in the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail and head domain, respectively. Three of the eleven non-conserved motifs are located within the stalk region, and the remaining eight motifs are located within the C-terminal head domain. As expected, no antigenic motif is located within the transmembrane region.",

            "text": "Cell entry of enveloped viruses involves virus attachment followed by close apposition and fusion of the virion and cell membranes. Although less research work has focused on the precise mechanism of PPRV cell entry, studies on other members of Morbillivirus (especially MeV) indicate that the fusion machinery is composed of hetero-oligomeric complexes formed by tetrameric attachment (H) and trimeric fusion (F) glycoproteins (Plattet et al., 2016) . While the head domains of the H protein recognize and bind multiple receptors, compelling functional and biochemical evidence indicate that the stalk region is predominantly involved in interaction with the F protein. A growing body of evidence suggests that engagement of H-heads with cognate receptors causes structural rearrangement within the H-stalk section, which is a strict requirement for triggering the F refolding cascade (Factivation) necessary to achieve membrane fusion (Corey and Iorio, 2007; Plattet et al., 2016) . Should triggering of the fusion machinery turn out to be essential for initiating morbillivirus infection, novel antivirals could be developed that specifically target the receptor-binding sites and impede receptor interaction or micro-domains within the head and/or stalk domains, thereby preventing conformational changes that evoke F activation. In conceptual support of using the stalk domain of H protein as a potential drug target, Plattet and Plemper reported that a mAb that recognized a linear epitope in the CDV H stalk domain acted as a potent inhibitor of membrane fusion (Plattet and Plemper, 2013) . Of the three BCE motifs, 73 RLNTNIKL 80 , 84 IDHQT 88 and 98 IIGDEV-GIRI 107 (corresponding to the 16-mers P10, P11 and P13, respectively) identified in the PPRV H-stalk region, the latter two were both predicted to be surface exposed and recognizable by goat anti-PPRV serum (Figs. 5b and 6) . Theoretically, these BCE motifs should also be considered as candidates when designing PPRV antibody-based drugs or multi-epitope vaccines.",

In combining the SLAM and nectin-4 receptors, the following residues of MeV H are involved: Pro 191 -Gly 196 , Lys 387 -Gln 391 , Pro 458 -Met 459 , Leu 462 -Gly 465 , Leu 482 -Phe 483 , Val 485 , Thr 498 -Leu 500 , Glu 503 , Asp 505 -Asp 507 , Tyr 524 , Leu 526 , Thr 528 , Asp 530 -Val 534 , Tyr 541 , and Tyr 543 -Arg 556 . Elucidation of the interaction between MeV H with its receptors provides an ideal template for homology modeling of other members of the genus Morbillivirus. Homology modeling and comparative interaction energy data indicated that the PPRV H-sheep SLAM binding interface and the MeV H-marmoset SLAM binding interface were consistent (Liang et al., 2016) . Based on these observations, four linear BCE motifs identified herein, 383 VEACKTR 389 , 463 FLGMINT 470 , 478 VMPHILT 484 , and 504 VDDDIK 509 in 16-mers P48, P58, P60 and P63, respectively, were located in the receptor binding pocket of PPRV H. Of these, 383 VEACKTR 389 , 478 VMPHILT 484 , and 504 VDDDIK 509 could be recognized by goat anti-PPRV serum (Figs. 5c and 6 ). Previous research on antigenic epitopes of MeV H showed that the majority of MeV H monoclonal antibodies with neutralizing capability were targeted to the receptor-binding area (Hashiguchi et al., 2011a; Tahara et al., 2016) . Accordingly, it is tempting to anticipate that the three BCE motifs in the 16-mers P48, P60 and P63 have the potential to be used as candidates for PPRV multi-epitope vaccine development.",

Among the surface proteins, only H protein induces little cross-reaction between viruses of the genus (Libeau, 2015) . Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the RPV and PPRV H proteins indicated only 50% similarity (Munir et al., 2013a R. Yu et al. Veterinary Microbiology 208 (2017) 110-117 2004), but little is known about the location of the BCEs to which the mAbs combine. In our research, sequence alignment indicates that there is no sequence motif in the RPV H protein identical to the minimal motifs of epitopes found in PPRV H protein. Clearly, identification of 13 PPRV specific linear BCE motifs, including two conserved BCE motifs, on the H protein is of significance for establishing PPRV differential diagnoses although their specificities have yet to be validated experimentally.",

Recently, Banyard's group have developed a novel strategy for constructing morbillivirus marker vaccines in which mutation of a specific mAb binding site on the RPV or PPRV H protein rendered the vaccine virus undetectable by the same mAb (Buczkowski et al., 2012; Muniraju et al., 2015) . This, in tandem with the cH-ELISA, allows differentiation between vaccinated and naturally infected animals. Clearly, identification of the minimal motifs of 13 linear BCE motifs on the PPRV H provides additional candidate epitopes and antigenic data for the development of a PPRV DIVA vaccine.",

Identification of the BCE motifs further elucidates the antigenic characteristics of the H protein, and provides a solid foundation for understanding the nature of immunity against PPRV and for the development of epitope-based surveillance and vaccination.",
