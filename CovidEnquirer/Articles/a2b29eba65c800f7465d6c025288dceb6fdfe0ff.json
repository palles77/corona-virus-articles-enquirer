This paper presents the numerical analysis of the influence of generating ways of the droplets or particles on the transport and distribution of the droplets or particles indoors. The drift flux model, which considers the settling of particles or droplets under the effect of gravitational sedimentation, is adopted to simulate the droplets transport and distribution indoors during respiration and sneezing or coughing process, while the simplified model for solving the continuous fluid flow is combined. Two different cases considering the normal respiration and coughing or sneezing are studied, respectively, and two different outlet velocities from the mouth for the sneezing or coughing process are considered. The results show that droplets or particles generated by normal breathing process transport a relatively short distance, while droplets or particles generated during coughing or sneezing may travel much longer distances, which may pose adverse effect on human bodies for defending the SARS or other infectious diseases. r",

The assumed velocity as boundary conditions in simulation is depicted in Fig. 2 . For respiration process, we assume breathing from the nose and the direction of inhaling/exhaling is 301 downward (Fig.  2(a) ). Two different outlet velocities from mouth for sneezing or coughing process are considered (V em =20 and 100 m/s, Fig. 2(b) ). It should be noted that many people sneeze more than once in a cycle of sneezing. However, we only consider sneezing or coughing once for simplification. In fact, the results in the following will show that sneezing or coughing only once may cause long transport distance and high concentration of particles, which implies that sneezing or coughing more than once may cause higher concentration. The outlet particle concentration by respiration, sneezing or coughing is assumed as 1.0, which may be used as a relative value. Table 1 presents the air supply parameters and other boundary conditions. As larger particles (d p 41 mm) generated from humans can only be transported within 1.0-1.5 m and these larger particles constitute less than 5% of all the particles or droplets of one human [12] , only fine particles are considered in the present study. Two different sizes of particles, 1.0 and 0.5 mm, are considered. Because results for the two sizes have little difference, only the results of 1.0 mm are presented next. The particle density is assumed as 600 kg/m 3 , which is the approximate density of ash particles or droplets of mixture composed of water and air. In fact, because the particles are fine ones, the density of particles does not remarkably influence the transport and distribution of the particles.",

Fig. 3 shows the streamline at the symmetrical plane (Z=1.5 m) during the first respiration period (see Fig. 2(a) ). Because of the relatively smaller air flow volume when breathing, the inhaling and exhaling processes have little influence on the room air flow pattern. Fig. 4 gives the particle concentration at different times when the human is exhaling or inhaling. It is seen that the particle concentration reduces to below 0.001% of the outlet particle concentration within 1.0 m away from the human. The air exchange rate per hour (ACH) for this case is 0.5. Thus, we can imagine that a larger air exchange rate may cause better indoor environment with lower particle concentration and shorter spreading distance of particles. This implies that the transport distance of particles or droplets generated by normal respiration of patients is limited.",

            "text": "Unlike normal respiration, sneezing or coughing may produce a large amount of particles of droplets, with a diameter of about 10-100 mm. However, they will split into smaller particles of 1-4 mm in a very short time [2] . Therefore, 1.0 mm is again adopted as the particle diameter in the simulation. Fig. 3(c) shows the streamline at the symmetrical plane (Z=1.5 m) for an initial velocity V em =100.0 m/s (see Fig. 2(b) ). It is seen that the large outlet velocity will maintain a much longer distance of particle transport due to the large momentum. Fig. 5 compares the simulated flow pattern with the measured one by [2] . The results seem reasonable. Fig. 6 further gives the particle concentration distribution at different times since the sneezing or coughing begins, which indicates that sneezing or coughing may cause long transport distance of particles, although the ventilation air exchange rate is rather large (5 ACH). Comparison of the two different outlet velocities of the sneezing or coughing case indicates that larger sneezing or coughing velocity will cause further transport and higher concentration of the exhaled particles or droplets. Fig. 7 shows the three-dimensional view of the particle concentration distribution at several different times. The contour zone stands for the particle concentration where the value is larger than 1% of the outlet concentration. If we define ''affecting range'' as the distance from the patient to where the concentration reduces to the ''safe threshold'', and define ''safe threshold'' as the percentage of outlet concentration that will not cause adverse effect on people, Fig. 7 depicts the ''affecting range'' of the sneezing or coughing if we consider 1% as the ''safe threshold'' (in fact, the exact threshold needs careful study). The figure also proves that particles generated during coughing or sneezing may travel a long distance, which may pose adverse effect on human bodies for defending the SARS or other infectious diseases. From the results, good personal habits, that is, covering the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing, is very important for preventing the transmission of the diseases from human to human.",
