We propose a biologically inspired immunization strategy that circumvents both of these problems by considering the number of links of a focal node and the way the neighbors are connected among themselves. The strategy thus measures the dependence of the neighbors on the focal node, identifying the ability of this node to spread the disease. Nodes with the highest ability in the network are the first to be immunized. To test the performance of our method, we conduct numerical simulations on several computer-generated and empirical networks, using the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. The results show that the proposed strategy largely outperforms the existing well-known strategies.",

In the case of an outbreak, the goal is to minimize the damage to the 'population' without violating the constraints of a limited budget. Achieving this goal in 'populations' other than the primitive, wellmixed ones is the main reason why the problems of (i) epidemics spreading in complex networks (Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani, 2001; Saumell-Mendiola et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2012; Wang and Xiao, 2012; Buono et al., 2014) and (ii) the corresponding immunization strategies (Balthrop et al., 2004; Bauch and Earn, 2004; Schneider et al., 2011; H\u00e9bert-Dufresne et al., 2013) attracted considerable attention in the literature. Such a trend is further spurred by the outcomes of ineffectively controlled epidemics-exemplified by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the swine flu (Schneider et al., 2011) -which rapidly spread all over the world due to globalization and better means of transport (Colizza et al., 2007; Perra et al., 2012 ). An immediate concern, therefore, is the development of the effective countermeasures against epidemics, wherein immunization science plays an important, if not critical, role.",

            "text": "Multiple immunization strategies have been considered for complex networks. Uniform or random immunization (Pastor- Satorras and Vespignani, 2002) selects any node in the network with equal probability at each time step, which results in a strategy suitable for homogeneous networks, but ignores the fact that in highly heterogeneous networks eradicating an infective agent cannot be guaranteed regardless of the fraction of immunized nodes. Targeted immunization (Mirzasoleiman et al., 2012; Schneider et al., 2012) seeks to overcome this problem by selecting the nodes with the highest ability to spread the disease. Such ability is often measured in terms of degree centrality, defined as the number of ties a node has, or betweenness centrality, which indicates how often a node is located along the shortest route between two other nodes. A strategy based on degree centrality is highly effective, yet it neglects the structural significance of a node because the most connected nodes are not necessarily the ones that facilitate disease propagation from one dense cluster to another (H\u00e9bert-Dufresne et al., 2013) . Betweenness centrality can be used to overcome such a shortcoming, but suffers from a considerable computational cost (H\u00e9bert-Dufresne et al., 2013) . In general, targeted immunization requires global knowledge of network properties, which is impractical. Motivated by such an impracticality, so-called acquaintance immunization (Cohen et al., 2003; Gallos et al., 2007) was developed, whereby immunized nodes comprise only a small fraction of random neighbors of randomly selected nodes. Furthermore, a number of alternative and/or more specialized strategies have also been discussed (Fu et al., 2008; L\u00fc et al., 2011; Gong et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014; Yan et al., 2014) . Owing to their immediate practical and economic implications, additional studies involving novel immunization strategies are still of considerable importance.",

The term biologically inspired is used in the sense that we draw inspiration from a singlecelled, ameba-like organism Physarum polycephalum, capable of transporting signals and nutrients through a dendritic (i.e. tree-like) network of tubular structures called pseudopodia (Nakagaki et al., 2000) . Physarum is particularly interesting because of the ability to perform cellular computations of a sort, which lead to the solution of, for example, the shortest path problem. This and similar observations served as a basis for constructing a mathematical model of an adaptive transport network driven by Poiseuille flow that exhibits computational abilities much like Physarum itself (Tero et al., 2007) . Subsequently, a Physarum-type algorithm has been used for solving the Steiner Minimum Tree problem (Tero et al., 2008 , for optimizing network design Watanabe et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2015; Song et al., 2014) , and for a variety of other applications (Zhang et al., 2012 Gao et al., 2013; Adamatzky, 2014; Adamatzky and Schubert, 2014) .",

First, we describe the Physarum model for the shortest path selection. We then modify the model by adding a noise factor to select the paths alternative to the shortest one along which the disease can still spread, albeit with a lower probability. Second, the original Physarum (single-source, single-sink) model is further modified to become a single-source, multi-sink model to consider the spread of the disease to multiple targets simultaneously. With these modifications, the model measures the dependence of each node in the network on the focal node. The third and final step in the construction of AS is motivated by the fact that applying the modified Physarum model to a large network is impractical due to a possible lack of information on the network structure or the high computational expense. Accordingly, for each focal node, a subnetwork consisting of the focal node itself and its R-step neighbors is separated from whole network, whereupon the model is applied to this R-local subnetwork. To test the performance of AS, we conduct numerical simulations on several computer-generated and empirical networks. Internal functioning of AS. Node 1 marked with wax-yellow color is the focal node, whereas the other nodes are its first-level neighbors. Panels a and b show the results of two model iterations in which nodes 3 and 2 are selected as the source nodes, respectively. These results are summed to produce the so-called flow matrix in panel c. Upon running all possible iterations (see the accompanying text), the ASscore for the focal node is obtained by summing the elements of the flow matrix across all edges.",

The pseudopodia thickness thus adapts to the flow rate.

The proposed immunization strategy is designed to quantify the ability of a focal node to spread the disease through the network. Put alternatively, we want to know (i) the extent to which the neighbors depend on the focal node and (ii) the relative importance of disease spreading pathways on which the focal node lies. Nodes 2, 3, and 4 in the inset of Fig. 2 , for example, are just partially dependent on node 1 because they are, among others, connected by pathways excluding the latter node. Node 5, by contrast, is fully dependent on node 1. Furthermore, if we consider the spread of the disease from node 5 to node 3, path 5-1-3 is the most direct, but the disease can spread through alternative paths 5-1-2-3 and 5-1-4-3. Such alternatives need to be taken into account to properly determine the ability of the focal node to spread the disease. The original Physarum model cannot yield the desired result. If we imagine for a moment that the link between nodes 1 and 3 is removed and assume that path 5-1-2-3 is just a tiny bit shorter than alternative path 5-1-4-3, all flow would be assigned to the former path. Node 4 would consequently be disregarded as irrelevant for the spread of the disease, while nodes 1 and 2 would (wrongly) be considered of equal relevance. However, the possibility of having an epidemic spread via both paths (i.e. 5-1-2-3 and 5-1-4-3) would suggest that nodes 2 and 4 should be seen almost as equivalents, whereas node 1 is of more immediate concern. The role of the noise factor, \u03b3, is to resolve the described problem. Indeed, the three paths from node 5 to node 3 are properly distinguished in Fig. 2 based on the flows, if the value of the noise factor is set to some \u03b3 > 0.5.",

The degree centrality strategy (DCS) fails to distinguish nodes 1 and i in Fig. 3a and b because it neglects how neighbors are connected among themselves. The betweenness centrality strategy (BCS) solves this problem, but by considering only the shortest paths, the strategy fails to distinguish nodes i and a in Fig. 3b and c.

DCS and CCS, in fact, end up marking the same five nodes for immunization shown in Fig. 4a , albeit in a different order. Note, however, that DCS is ambiguous as to what the order should be because nodes 3-6 have the same degree. Without an additional criteria, there is no reason to prefer one node over the other (we actually followed the numbering of nodes). Although all strategies singled out nodes 1 and 16, this is where the similarities end. BCS and AS (Fig. 4b and c ) go beyond the node degree to mark nodes 23 and 24, both with only two links, for immunization. Nonetheless, the best performer is AS because after the first five nodes are immunized, the biggest cluster that can get infected is of size three (containing nodes 2, 3, and 4), whereas the other strategies leave clusters of size four (DCS and CCS) and even size five (BCS) exposed.",

However, random networks are not supposed to have structurally important nodes in the sense of H\u00e9bert-Dufresne et al.

In scale-free networks, by contrast, structurally important nodes are most likely the ones with a high degree.

In the power network, judging from Fig. 6c , DCS is surprisingly weak, but such a lackluster performance may have been caused by a low fraction of immunized nodes (5%) in the presented example (Fig. 7c) . More importantly, AS once again emerges as a clear victor. The same is even more pronounced in the Yeast network (Fig. 7d) .

By looking at the dependence between any two nodes, we modified the original Physarum model with a noise factor for similar path finding. We then extended the model to include multi-foraging in order to obtain the dependence of other nodes on the focal one. This dependence is expressed in the form of a flow matrix, which indicates the ability of the focal node to spread the disease. Perhaps the most important properties of such a design are the ability to (i) distinguish situations that other comparable methods cannot and (ii) recognize structurally critical nodes that may not have a high degree themselves, yet they connect dense clusters of nodes.",

The proposed method partly overcomes these difficulties by being local in the sense of H\u00e9bert-Dufresne et al. (2013) . The information on a few R-local subnetworks can be used to start an immunization program, which can later be expanded in scope as the new information comes in.

            "text": "There are fundamental obstacles to analytically comparing the performance of various immunization strategies. Namely, a network's (mean-field) statistics translate into the statistics of nodes selected for immunization by each of the methods, which in turn determines the value of a common performance indicator (e.g. the largest fraction of nodes that can get infected after immunization, F). This sequence of dependencies is most easily seen by considering the workings of the degree centrality strategy, and is reflected in the fact that the simulated performance of each strategy varies greatly with the network structure. A more important consequence is that any analytical proof that one method is better than the others would have to start by assuming a mean-field statistic, and therefore would remain specific to such a statistic, largely diminishing the usefulness of this approach. Furthermore, mean-field statistics are generally known only for synthetic networks arising from the well-known (e.g. Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi and scalefree) algorithms, yet these networks fail to fully reveal how advantageous the proposed strategy (AS) is (Fig. 5) . AS truly shines when applied to highly heterogeneous, real-world networks (Figs. 6 and 7; also see below). To strengthen the case for AS, we performed a number of analyses beside those found in the main text. First we compare how AS fares against a fairly recent immunization strategy called k-core (hereafter KCS) (Kitsak et al., 2010; Wei et al., 2015) . A conceptual advantage of AS in comparison with KCS is that the latter strategy needs global knowledge to decompose a network and then identify the most influential nodes. AS, by contrast, relies only on local identification, meaning that the influence of each node is assessed from the information on the node's immediate neighborhood. Despite the information \"handicap\" of being local, AS manages to outperform KCS in all four real-world networks considered in the main text (Fig. A1 ). In addition, we provide the simulation results for the leader rank strategy (LRS) (L\u00fc et al., 2011) which also appeared in the literature fairly recently. LRS in some instances (Fig. A2a and c) achieves almost the same efficiency as AS, yet we have not identified any examples in which the former strategy would outperform the latter.",
