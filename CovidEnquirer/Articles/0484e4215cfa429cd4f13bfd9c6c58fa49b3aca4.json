This study uses daily data over the past two decades to determine the minimum variance hedge ratio for airlines wishing to hedge jet fuel price risk with futures, while also establishing the best cross hedging asset. Airlines hedging with futures would create the most effective hedge by using heating oil futures contracts with a 3-month maturity. We also find that beyond the 3-month veil, increased time to maturity makes heating oil less effective as a cross hedge proxy for jet fuel. However, both in-sample analysis and Monte Carlo simulation results with daily data show that none of the 4 cross hedge proxies, including heating oil, can be considered highly effective.",

In conjunction with this, airlines have narrow profit margins implying that airlines have restricted cash flows in the event of an input price increase. The combination of these factors means that for an airline to succeed it must manage costs more efficiently. Of airlines' many costs, the two largest single areas of cost are labor and jet fuel. Traditionally, labor has been an airline's greatest cost but jet fuel has gradually replaced labor as the single largest cost. The increase in the price of jet fuel has been paired with an increase in the price volatility, meaning that not only have the price swings become larger as a percentage, but fuel costs have also become larger in both nominal and real terms.",

Other airlines have gone as far as replacing the seats, television monitors, and even the beverage carts with newer and lighter versions (FAA, 2011) . However, these improvements have not been enough for airlines to remain profitable during times of increased jet fuel costs. Because of this, fuel hedging and financial contracts play an important role in fuel cost risk management. Typically airlines use a cross hedge, where the hedging contracts have commodities that are highly correlated with jet fuel. Airlines are presented with a small array of different commodity options, but the most widely used are West Texas Intermediate e Sweet Crude (WTI), Brent North Sea oil (Brent), heating oil and gasoil.",

Previously, the price movements for WTI and other crude oils moved along similar to the movements of jet fuel. However, recently the movements have become less correlated. As the gap between crude and jet fuel prices increases, it will significantly hurt those who hedge with WTI futures. Recent shale revolution and increased unconventional oil production in North America strained the existing infrastructure at Cushing, resulting in a bottleneck that led to excess supply which resulted in the large price differential between WTI and Brent. Additionally, since the pipelines are at capacity, the truck and rail costs of transporting crude oil to the Gulf Coast also increased the price differential between the Gulf Coast and WTI. While there are many reasons for the gap increases, one potential reason is that the U.S. is exploiting new sources of crude oil, which is lowering the price (IATA, 2013) .",

Much of the existing literature in this area addresses why firms hedge (Morrell and Swan, 2006; Halls, 2005) , value creation from hedging (Carter et al., 2006) , or transportation operations and hedging (Treanor et al., 2014; Lim and Hong, 2014) . There is limited research (Adams and Gerner, 2012 ) that presents the optimal volatility reducing hedge ratio for airlines. Furthermore, no study has examined the hedge effectiveness of the abovementioned petroleum commodities for jet fuel. While other studies have attempted to provide this answer, they have focused more on the models than the results.",

This means that any sort of external shock to their already narrow profit margins could result in a huge loss for the airlines. If jet fuel costs were constantly rising, then airlines could react appropriately; however because the price will change frequently and erratically, airlines have a harder time planning their expenses. For example, in 2008 the price of jet fuel in the beginning of January was $2.714 per gallon; it rose 54% in six months to $ 4.179 per gallon before falling 71% to $1.202 in December of that year.

Also, when airlines do face high jet fuel prices, there does not seem to be any possible short term capacity adjustments to tackle the sticky and fixed costs (Borenstein, 2011) . To protect themselves from adverse price swings many airlines enter into derivative contracts and financial instruments, although others have resorted to other alternatives, like the 2012 Delta Air Lines purchase of an oil refinery (Delta Air Lines, 2013) . The takeover of an oil refinery gives many benefits to Delta. First, it may help to protect against swings in all petroleum commodity prices. Delta has contracts in place to exchange the non-jet fuel distillates and products to BP and Phillips 66 for jet fuel (Delta Air Lines, 2013) . Additionally, the purchase of the refinery included the assets needed to use the jet fuel refined at Trainer to support Delta's operations in Northeastern US, including LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International Airport (Delta Air Lines, 2013). However, the purchase of the refinery exposes the airline to the additional risks that arise from operating a refinery.",

            "text": "Because of jet fuel price risks, many airlines have created fuel hedging programs in an attempt to limit their exposure to upward swings in the cost of jet fuel. The problem with jet fuel is not specifically the cost but the volatility in the cost, because risk does not necessarily depend on the cost of the asset. U.S. airlines often have a difficult time hedging. Airlines frequently use an Over the Counter (OTC) contract called a forward that is specifically catered to the airline's needs, but this is often a difficult task for an airline that refuels in many places. The OTC derivative markets were implicated as a systemic risk during the U.S. financial crisis of 2008. To address the regulatory oversight of the huge risk exposures associated with the OTC markets, one of the requirements under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, is that most OTC derivatives be traded on exchange (Miller and Ruane, 2012) . More airlines may begin to hedge on exchange traded contracts after the implementation of the Dodd-Frank requirement and when more exchange traded contracts become available. During most of the period of this study (1994e2014), there were no exchange traded jet fuel contracts. This means that airlines must undertake a practice called cross hedging. In this practice, an item that is highly correlated with jet fuel is hedged. For airlines, this means that in lieu of using futures contracts for jet fuel, they would use one of a different petroleum product. Airlines are left with the choice of which commodity they would like to use as a cross hedge. 2 Southwest Airlines is well known for hedging a high percentage of its fuel use and mentions \"the Company has found that financial derivative instruments in other commodities, such as West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, Brent crude oil, and refined products, such as heating oil and unleaded gasoline, can be useful in decreasing its exposure to jet fuel price volatility\" (Southwest Airlines, 2013; page 25). However, the use of instruments with underlying assets that differ from those actually used leads to a potential situation where the two commodities are not perfectly correlated. The difference between the spot and futures prices is called the basis. For firms that cross hedge, there is an increase in the size of the basis, leading to an increased amount of basis risk.",

In the U.S., this requirement is determined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), whose standards are then used by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The rule for hedge accounting is FAS 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. To meet the FAS 133 requirements and be considered for hedge accounting, the instrument must be highly correlated and effective at offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows. While the rule does not make any numeric definition, the rule-of-thumb is a correlation coefficient of 0.90 or an adjusted R 2 of 0.80 or higher (Finnerty and Grant, 2002; CME Group, 2012) . 5 FAS 133 also requires a firm to declare any derivatives held and value them at the price they are worth at the time of declaration. This process is called \"mark-to-market.\" By requiring firms to mark-to-market, the FASB prevents firms from inflating (deflating) losses (profits). Because of these requirements, as well as others that define hedging accounting, not every airline implements it. The choice to implement hedging accounting affects the cash flows of the firm. By implementing hedge accounting, a firm may post losses and gains from hedging along with the corresponding asset and cash flow. By not implementing hedging accounting, a firm has more control over what it deems as a suitable hedging instrument; however it faces different tax and SEC regulations as the income is considered earnings.",

In light of increased crack spread and the difficulty to find a feasible strategy, some industry leaders are contemplating abandoning fuel hedging and passing fuel costs to consumers, a practice commonly used by freight carriers like UPS and FedEx. 7 But going unhedged may be riskier.

This is probable for petroleum commodity prices; the prices of these related commodities are likely to have a common trend (Adams and Gerner, 2012) . Ignoring the long-term equilibrium relationship between the contemporaneous price variables will result in overdifferencing. Thus, we apply an error correction term to account for the equilibrium relationship between the spot and futures prices.

Additionally, airlines hedging with futures would create the most effective hedge by using 3-month maturity contracts of heating oil, but the hedge effectiveness of heating oil diminishes with increased time to contract maturity.",

            "text": "However, based on our in-sample analysis and Monte Carlo simulation results, even with heating oil, the hedging performance is less than 67% for hedge effectiveness; the performance improves to about 71% with weekly hedge horizon. The results in this study may be sensitive to the hedge horizon. To gain a more holistic view of hedging performance and model usage, the duration of a hedge should be carefully examined in future research to associate data frequency with the intended hedge horizon.",
