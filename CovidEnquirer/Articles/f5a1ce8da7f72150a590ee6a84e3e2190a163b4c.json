            "text": "Bringing basic and clinical research together to an integrated understanding of psychiatric disorders Psychiatric research is one of the most complex medical endeavors because the pathology underlying psychiatric disorders is located in the most complex organ, the brain, and the phenotype of psychiatric disorders is very heterogeneous. The articles in this double-issue of the Journal of Psychiatric Research demonstrate this complexity by addressing basic as well as clinical approaches, which should be regarded as complementary and can improve our understanding of psychiatric illnesses.",

            "text": "This double-issue contains several interesting articles on schizophrenia. Kubicki et al. (2007) , for instance, review the results of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies in schizophrenia, a method that makes it possible to evaluate the organization and coherence of cranial white matter fiber tracts. DTI provides a novel approach to understanding how specific brain regions are connected and how disturbances of these connections may tribute to cognitive and other clinical abnormalities observed in schizophrenia. The findings of Ling et al. (2007) are also in support of the hypothesis that structural damage to the brain plays a role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. They observed higher plasma levels of S-100b in schizophrenia, a protein assumed to reflect structural damage to the CNS. Applying proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Shimizu et al. (2007) found evidence for neuronal loss in the posterior cingulate gyrus in schizophrenia. The causes for these disturbances, however, are not completely understood. Reduced activity of neurotrophic factors like BDNF could be an explanation (Grillo et al., 2007) . Beyond this, genetic alterations provide an important source of further factors explaining these disturbances. H\u00e4nninen et al. (2007) demonstrate that a genetic variant in a gene expressing the polypeptide epidermal growth factor (EGF) is associated with an early age at onset in male schizophrenic patients. This gene exerts neurotrophic and neuromodulatory effects on developing dopaminergic neurons, and lower postmortem levels of EGF family proteins were observed in the prefrontal cortex and striatum of schizophrenic patients. These findings suggest that genetically mediated effects on neuronal development might be involved in the vulnerabil-ity for schizophrenia, possibly by affecting the neuronal connectivity in cortical structures. Other theories postulate that altered immune system function is involved in the etiopathology of schizophrenia. Riedel et al. (2007) addressed this by examining T cellular immune response in schizophrenic patients. They found diminished skin reactions to different antigens demonstrating a markedly attenuated T helper cell type-1 (Th-1) mediated immune response in these patients. Since Th-1 mediated immune response has been implicated in host defense against neurotropic pathogens, the findings by Riedel et al. points to another possible causation for an altered neuronal connectivity in schizophrenia. In this context, it is important to note that altered immune function is also discussed as etiopathological factors in depression and dementia. While Marques-Deak et al. (2007) Brain imaging, genotyping, and tests of immune system function are important methods to understand the biology of psychiatric illnesses. However, the description of pathology is incomplete without examining specific behavioral phenotypes. Tobacco use is a very predominant behavioral phenotype in schizophrenia. Tang et al. (2007) observed that cigarette smoking is associated with a higher degree of interpersonal problems and a higher frequency of relapse suggesting a major relevance for this phenotype on outcome of schizophrenia. Weight gain is another phenotype frequently observed in schizophrenia, particularly under treatment with atypical neuroleptics. Findings by Atmaca et al. (2007) suggest that alteration in leptin and nitric oxide regulation could be responsible for these side effects.",

Nevertheless, the use of these instruments in medical outcome studies is recommended, since these functions are of major importance for the treatment outcome as perceived by the patients themselves, which should be the most important criterion for a successful treatment.",

Some of the upcoming issues will be published ''off-catalog'' in advance to the actual cover-date until the backlog of manuscripts in press and the administrative workflow allow publishing on schedule.
