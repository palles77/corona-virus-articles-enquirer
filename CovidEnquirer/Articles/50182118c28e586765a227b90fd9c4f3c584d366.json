We have, therefore, studied the prophylactic and therapeutic effects of exogenous recombinant interferono~-2a on RSV infections in adult volunteers and the results are reported here. Although the illness following re-infection with RSV in adults, a common cold, differs from that of a primary infection in babies and affects a different region of the respiratory tract, the results obtained could give an indication of the response to be expected in children.",

Virus was detected and identified by specific immunofluorescence of cells scraped from the tubes. Antiviral antibody was detected by an ELISA test based on a test for coronavirus antibody previously described (Callow, 1985) . Frozen and thawed virus-infected tissue culture, clarified by centrifugation, was used as antigen and similarly treated, uninfected cultures acted as a control. Both were bound directly to microtitre plates. Suitable dilutions of serum were bound and IgG detected with a phosphataselinked antibody probe. Antibody titres were calculated by a computer programme and expressed in terms of arbitrary units assigned to a reference human serum which was titrated in parallel in every set of assays. A 1.5-fold rise represented an increase twice that of the standard error of the test and was regarded as significant. Antibody measured in this way is not a good predictor of susceptibility to infection.",

The two groups were well balanced for sex, age, pre-challenge antibody concentration and psychological scores (Table  1) .

Ten of the 19 in the interferonot-2a group showed laboratory evidence of infection compared with 14 of the 19 in the placebo group.

In both models about half of the volunteers infected with the virus develop colds. In both instances there was a marked prophylactic effect but no evi- dence of a beneficial action when given therapeutically. Furthermore, the significant increase in mean daily clinical score in the interferonet-2a group compared with the placebo group, before colds developed in the prophylactic study and during medication in the therapeutic trial, provide further evidence that interferon, when given for even short periods, acts as an irritant (Hayden et al., 1983; Scott et al., 1985) . These findings are predictable in rhinovirus infections as interferonot-2a has no direct effect on the virus particle and requires time to induce an antiviral state in the host cells. As RSV is such a poor inducer of interferon and so sensitive to its action it was hoped that it might be possible to use interferon to treat RSV infections. There is no evidence from this study to support the therapeutic use of interferon in RSV infections, although it is still possible that interferon might be effective in treating primary RSV infections in infants.",

It is not possible from these data, to say what would be result of treating bronchiolitis with intrapulmonary interferonot-2a. However, our results together with the failure of systemic interferon to influence the course of severe RSV infection in seven children (Chiba et al., 1988 ) offers little encouragement. On the other hand the efficacy of interferonet-2a in preventing RSV infections in adults suggests that a contact prophylaxis study for preventing RSV infection in children at high risk for severe infection (e.g. babies with cystic fibrosis or bronchopulmonary dysplasia) analogous to those performed by Hayden et al. (1986) and Douglas et al. (1986) for rhinovirus infections might be effective, even though there was no trend in these studies indicating a beneficial effect on RSV infections.",
