Over the next few months it will become extremely important for governments and regulatory authorities to initiate open public debates on deliberate release in order to provide balanced information. Without open debate a polarized, unworkable entrenchment will develop between the biotechnology industry and its opponents. In Europe the BioTa2000 multi-media programme, partly financed by the European Commission, has started to provide the public with information.",

It is a mistake, born of concern for share prices or scientific prestige, to try to sell the public the wonders of biotechnology without properly addressing, the risks. Public suspicion delays development as the 'ice-minus' case has clearly demonstrated. ",

            "text": "It is hard for us to imagine how revolutionary were the discovery and first description of the substance that Alec Isaacs called 'interferon' in the late 1950s 1. To many it was a figment of a vivid scientific imagination, yet the original observations were carefully repeated in many laboratories and the production by cells of a soluble substance to explain viral interference was more or less accepted by the 1970s. When interferon was discovered, it was realized that it was possible to interfere with viral replication without necessarily endangering cellular metabolism and many thought that interferon might prove to be a useful antiviral agent. However, a major problem was in material supply and this remained so until the cloning of interferon genes inE. coliin the late 1970s, and the concomitant successful development of large-scale lymphoblastoid interferon production. To give examples of the early supply problems, a two-year collaboration between Glaxo and Wellcome laboratories produced sufficient monkey kidney cell interferon for a single small dose to be inoculated intradermally in 36 volunteers to prevent vaccinia. This was an expensive business and even though the trial was very successful (vaccinia appearing to be highly susceptible in rive), it was considered of very dubious commercial merit.",

The successful trial reported in 1973 (Ref. 2) of repeated intransal sprays of interferon against experimental common colds in volunteers given rhinovirus type 2, used about one year's manufacturing supply from this process. Thus although it was a success, there was insufficient interferon to pursue further studies, let alone sell interferon for common colds.",

This was done remarkably successfully and several pharmaceutical companies have collaborated with gene technology firms to develop the products of this work. It should be understood that even though successful trials had been done with buffy coat interferon, each product of gene cloning needed to be thoroughly evaluated for quality assurance, activity and toxicity, much in the same way as a new pharmaceutical product. There are many a-interferon genes but so far there is no evidence that one interferon will be better than another. Those that have been developed are a-2 and a-l, which are predominant in natural leucocyte and lymphoblastoid preparations. Cloned y-interferon is also under trial but the results are slow to emerge. It is not surprising that progress has seemed to be slow and much of the artificial enthusiasm for these 'cure-all' products has waned since 1980. The hopes and predictions made public at that time were quite unrealistic and were not generally felt by those working in the interferon field. Nevertheless, interferons do appear to have some important clinical applications.",

The findings of many trials, summarized recently by Phillpotts and Tyrrell 4, show first, that interferon has to be given before the virus to prevent colds. This is not surprising when we consider that the maximal endogenous interferon response coincides with peak virus replication, which in turn coincides with symptoms. Secondly, the minimum dose needed to inhibit a virus given at any time of the day or night is about 2 \u00d7 106U intranasally, taken 8-hourly.",

If intranasal interferon is continued for more than a few days, some volunteers begin to develop local nasal symptoms, which reflect nasal mucosal ulceration and intense mucosal lymphocytic infiltrates. These side-effects seem to be consistent for each interferon tested but are dose dependent and may be made worse by preservatives in the nasal solutions. By the end of two weeks, as many as 50% of volunteers taking the minimum dose needed to protect against wild colds may have symptoms.",

Similar protocols were used and the results were almost identical. These studies were possible because of the way in which common cold viruses appear to be transmitted. The reservoir of circulating viruses is mainly in nonimmune children at school who play in close contact with each other and observe no simple hygienic precautions. These children contract colds and bring home large quantities of virus in their nasal secretions to infect susceptible adults, principally by mucosa-to-hand-to-mucosa contact and even via fomites contaminated with nasal mucus, where many respiratory viruses can survive for hours.",

Perhaps better effects against other viruses could be achieved by increasing the frequency of doses, but each trial of a new dose schedule will be difficult and expensive. If interferon is to be used in this way, it will have to be available cheaply over the counter so that it can be taken soon enough to be effective.
