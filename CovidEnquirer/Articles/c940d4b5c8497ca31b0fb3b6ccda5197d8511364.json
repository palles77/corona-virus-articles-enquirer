This method takes advantages of the amino-modified silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles prepared using water-in-oil microemulsion technique, which employs amino-modified silica as the shell and iron oxide as the core of the magnetic nanoparticles. The nanoparticles have a silica surface with amino groups and can be conjugated with any desired bio-molecules through many existing amino group chemistry. In this research, a linear DNA probe was immobilized onto nanoparticles through streptavidin conjugation using covalent bonds. A target ssDNA(I) (5 -TMR-CGCATAGGGCCTCGTGATAC-3 ) has been successfully recovered from a crude sample under a magnet field through their special recognition and hybridization. A designed ssDNA fragment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus at a much lower concentration than the target ssDNA(I) was also recovered with high efficiency and good selectivity.",

            "text": "The separation and recovery of an analyte is a fundamental technique in many fields, including chemistry, biology, biomedicine, industry, and environmental control. Target DNA separation and recovery is important for numerous applications in biotechnology and medicine. These applications include gene transfection, accurate PCR for mutation detection, gene therapy, species identification, and evolutionary analysis [1] . There are two principles for recovery of target DNA. Gel electrophoresis is a traditional method of DNA separation and recovery [2] [3] [4] , in which a strand is cut into many pieces and passed through a porous gel, wherein shorter pieces move faster and farther than the longer ones. From the distribution of the fragments, information about the genetic content can be determined through comparison with the marker DNA. To recover the wanted target DNA, the further extremely time-consuming experiments must be performed, including recovery of DNA from agarose by electroe-lution, recovery of DNA from agarose gels with spin column, recovery of DNA from agarose gels by phenol extraction, and recovery of DNA from low-melting agarose with LiCl [5] . On the other side, the recovery of trace target nucleic acids in complex chemical and genetic backgrounds (e.g. pathogen detection) can also be realized based on the nucleic acid or peptide nucleic acid affinity-purification methods [6, 7] . However, these experimental methods possess a typical run time of more than 10 h due to the complex separation steps, such as centrifugation, columniation, filtration, and so on.",

All kinds of functionalized nanoparticles have been developed; in particular, substantial progress has been made in magnetic nanospheres and ferrofluids development technologies [18, 19] . Due to their size-dependent properties and dimensional similarities to biomacromolecules [20] [21] [22] , these magnetic nanoparticles can be used as contrast agents for in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [23, 24] , as longcirculating carriers for drug release/delivery, and poten-tially as oligonucleotide separation devices in medicine and biotechnology. Magnetic isolation of these bio-molecules is faster than standard liquid chromatography and electrophoresis techniques. Target molecules, such as peptides, proteins, and oligonucleotides can be separated and recovered from untreated crude samples without any filtration, and pretreatment steps by magnetic bio-conjugates, i.e. by attaching bio-specific ligands to them. Tan and co-workers developed a novel genomagnetic nanocapture for the collection of trace amounts of DNA/mRNA molecules based on the molecular beacon [25] . In fact, this novel nanocapture is a kind of magnetic nanoparticle, which incorporates DNA probes. A weakness of this protocol is that DNA probe immobilization was carried out through conjugation of avidin onto the nanoparticles by use of a weak electrostatic interaction. Such linking is not stable, which will affect the lifetime of the nanocapture. At the same time, Tan et al. reported the collection of DNA using a molecular beacon (MBs) probe that is a class of DNA probes widely used in chemistry, biology, biotechnology and medical sciences for bio-molecular recognition. However, in most biosensor applications, the sensitivity of the MBs immobilized on a silica surface is usually low due to its steric hindrance on the solid surface [26] . In addition, the sensitivity of the DNA probe will directly affect the efficiency of the separation and recovery. As known, the lifetime and the efficiency of separation and recovery are two important factors to the nanocapture.",

In the presence of TEOS and EPTES (5:3, v/v), polymerization reaction was initiated by adding 100 l of concentrated NH 4 OH. The reaction was allowed to continue for 24 h to produce magnetic nanoparticles. Then, the magnetic nanoparticles were isolated by magnetic separation and washed with ethanol and water for several times to remove all remaining material and surfactant molecules.",

Meanwhile, the fluorescence intensity of the dissociated target ssDNA(I) solution increased gradually when the separated magnetic DNA bio-conjugate was denaturalized at a different temperature, as shown in Fig. 4 . After denaturalization at 95 \u2022 C, for about 10 min, the fluorescence intensity of the dissociated target ssDNA was almost the same as that of the initial target ssDNA(I) solution (Fig. 3) . These results indicate that the target ssDNA(I) can be recovered from solution by this method and dissociated from magnetic DNA bio-conjugate, which can be used for further research. The fluorescence microscopy imaging of the nanoparticles also showed that the capture ssDNA(I)-modified amino-modified silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles displayed intensive fluorescence after it was incubated with the fluorescence-labeled target ssDNA(I) and separated under the magnet field. After the separated magnetic DNA bio-conjugate was denatured in 95 \u2022 C water bath for 10 min and washed for several times, the fluorescence on the separated magnetic DNA bio-conjugate disappeared due to the release of the fluorescence-labeled target ssDNA(I) from the nanoparticles.

The results demonstrated that the target ssDNA(I) could be easily recovered from the solution by using the capture ssDNA(I)-modified amino-modified silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles. It became clear that the existence of capture ssDNA(I) on the amino-modified silica-coated magnetic nanoparticle was the major cause of the target ssDNA(I) recovery.
