Sepsis is the most common precipitating factor in the development of AKI, and sepsis-associated AKI (SA-AKI) is often more acute and severe compared with AKI without sepsis, posing significant clinical challenges [4, 5] .",

In this study, we investigated the clinical utility of PENK in comparison with NGAL in terms of AKI detection and prognosis prediction in septic patients. In addition, we compared the levels of these two kidney biomarkers using four different eGFR equations (MDRD Study and three CKD-EPI equations) to explore how the equations vary across AKI and sepsis severity.

Of note, both PENK and NGAL concentrations were significantly different between the two groups of RRT, and PENK predicted RRT better than NGAL (P = 0.0085). These results indicate that the performance of tested AKI biomarkers is not distinctly better than that of eGFR; however, PENK might predict the need for RRT more accurately. According to our data, each pair of the four eGFR equations showed only minimal to weak agreement for defining reduced GFR (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) (Fig. 2) . The proportion of reduced GFR was the highest based on the CKD-EPICysC equation and the lowest based on the CKD-EPICr equation (58.7% vs 44.9%, P < 0.0001). This finding implies that the clinical decision regarding reduced GFR can be greatly affected by the eGFR equation used [22] . This is in line with the current recommendation not to use formulas to estimate GFR in critically ill patients [6] . Al-though it is recommended to estimate GFR by the calculated Cr clearance using the UV/P (mL/min) formula in these patients, this technique requires the collection of at least one hour's worth of urine, which could constitute an obstacle from a practical viewpoint [6, 12] . With the current serum Cr-based AKI definition, AKI mortality and morbidity remain high and the detection of suboptimal and/or early kidney injury is not optimal; thus, AKI diagnosis is shifting from clinical to molecular diagnosis [23] . In this regard, the availability of stable, surrogate renal biomarkers would be beneficial; PENK could be a promising option instead of using equations or formulas.",

            "text": "The pathophysiology driving SA-AKI is not completely understood and is distinct from other AKIs [5, 24, 25] . SA-AKI may have numerous drivers, including ischemic-reperfusion injury to the glomerulus, inflammation of specific parts of the nephron, hypoxic and/or oxidant stress, cytokine-and chemokine driven tubular injury, and tubular and mesenchymal apoptosis [5, 26] . Moreover, septic shock is a subset of sepsis characterized by a state of acute circulatory failure associated with infection. Our data shows that both renal biomarkers increased and the four eGFR equations decreased in the septic shock stage, even in patients without AKI (Table 1 and Table 2 ). In addition to its role as a renal biomarker, PENK has also been reported to be an independent predictor of heart failure [27, 28] . Taken together, increased PENK concentration in the septic shock stage can be explained by both renal and cardiac dysfunction. The observation of decreased eGFR in septic shock without AKI also supports the recent recommendation not to use eGFR equations for these critically ill patients [6] . In this study, AKI was diagnosed based on serum Cr change according to the KDIGO criteria [17] . However, the increase in serum Cr occurs relatively late, 24-48 hr after kidney injury. In view of this inherent limitation of the serum Cr-based definition of AKI, subclinical AKI has been suggested by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI)-10 consensus work group [29] . High PENK concentrations in the septic shock stage may suggest the presence of subclinical AKI, which Table 1 . The median PENK concentration was below the 154.5 pmol/L cut-off obtained by the ROC curve analysis and was also lower than or similar to the 99th percentile of the normal range (80 pmol/L) in the normal GFR categories ( \u2265 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). (B) The median concentration of NGAL was below the 493 ng/mL cut-off that was obtained by the ROC curve analysis; however, it was higher than the literature-and manufacturer-recommended 150 ng/mL cut-off in the normal GFR categories. Data are expressed as median (interquartile range). Abbreviations: see Table 1 cannot be detected by the current definition. PENK and NGAL concentrations increased significantly as GFR reduced according to the GFR categories (Fig. 3) . Of note, regardless of the eGFR equation used, PENK concentration was constantly lower than the 154.5 pmol/L cut-off in normal GFR ( \u2265 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) categories and it was also lower than the 99th percentile of the normal range (80 pmol/L). However, NGAL concentrations were higher than the literature-and manufacturer-recommended 150 ng/mL cut-off, although they were below the 493 ng/mL ROC curve analysis cut-off. These findings imply that PENK may reflect GFR better than NGAL and may not be influenced by inflammation. Otto et al [30] reported that the function of circulating plasma NGAL is not restricted solely to the detection of AKI; it might be involved in immune response during inflammation. PENK would be a reliable and objective alternative to eGFR equations for defining reduced GFR and the presence of AKI in septic patients.",

In the present study, PENK concentration and eGFRs based on the four equations all showed significant differences between survivors and non-survivors (Table 3) . We also observed significant differences between the two groups (favorable vs unfavorable) in the survival analysis using two different cut-offs. However, no significant differences were observed for NGAL, regardless of the cut-off. Our data suggests that PENK is superior to NGAL in predicting clinical outcome in septic patients. Moreover, the highest HR was observed when the 80 pmol/L cut-off was applied for PENK. This finding supports the appropriateness and clinical usefulness of this cut-off in septic conditions [18] .",

We focused on the comparison between PENK and NGAL concentrations with eGFR equations in terms of AKI diagnosis and prognosis prediction; thus, we did not investigate the distribution of these biomarkers in relation to the specific bacteriological identification. In addition, we did not compare PENK and NGAL with the other AKI biomarkers including interleukin 8 and kidney injury molecule-1. We could not collect follow-up samples for serial observation of these biomarkers in septic patients. This study was a cross-sectional retrospective registry study; therefore, it was difficult to observe the temporary development of AKI in association with PENK and NGAL increase. Although we compared eGFRs according to the MDRD Study and CKD-EPI equations, we did not measure the actual value of GFR; therefore, we could not deterwww.annlabmed.org https://doi.org/10.3343/alm.2017.37.5.388 mine which eGFR value was the closest to true GFR.
