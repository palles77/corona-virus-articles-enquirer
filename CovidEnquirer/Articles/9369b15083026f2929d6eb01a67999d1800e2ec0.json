Actually in literature, CPV-2 has been reported with clinical signs that vary from the classical disease, and immunochromatography test and PCR technique have been introduced to veterinary hospitals to confirm CPV-2 diagnosis and other infections. However, the reliability of these techniques has been poorly analyzed. In this study, we evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of veterinary clinical diagnosis, immunochromatography test and PCR technique. Our data indicate that variations in the clinical signs of CPV-2 complicate the gathering of an appropriate diagnosis; and immunochromatography test and PCR technique do not have adequate sensitivity to diagnose positive cases.",

Only 20% of the studied dogs presented typical signs as commonly described in literature. Clinical variability for this disease has been reported previously [2, 4, 7, 10, 15, 18] , and some authors have discussed factors, such as age, immune status, exposure route, viral dose, virulence of strains and co-infection with other infectious agents as possible causes [4, 15, 18] . This complicates obtaining an accurate diagnosis of CPV-2 when veterinarians rely solely on their clinical examination. Therefore, regarding our investigation solely based on this procedure, 42.2% of dogs will have a false-negative CPV-2 diagnosis.Through dogs medical records in this study, we observed that veterinarians were ruling out the possibility of infection primarily because the dogs were not exhibiting the classical clinical signs described in literature, had been vaccinated against CPV-2 and/or were adults. However, most of the dogs in our study displayed atypical signs. Therefore, we believe that subclinical infections of CPV-2 are more common, and veterinarians, who must decide whether or not to use additional diagnostic tests with high sensitivity and specificity, should seriously consider these findings. --+  ---+  +  35  +  -+  +  +  --+  +  36  --+  +  ---+  +  37  --+  +  -+  --+  38  Nd  --+  +  ---+  39  +  -+  -+  ---+  40  +  -+  +  -+  --+  41 Nd In this study, 40% of patients positive to CVP-2 had been previously immunized. It is well known that PCR technique is highly sensitive, and therefore, it detects vaccine viral particles in feces from recently vaccinated patients; studies indicate that it is possible to obtain false-positive results from days 3 to 10 post-vaccination with a modified live CPV vaccine [10, 18] . Consequently, to perform this study, patients with history of vaccination on the previous 15 days were excluded. Additionally, samples from vaccinated dogs positive to CPV-2 were sequenced, and in all studied cases, the genovariant CPV-2c was identified (data not show), which implies that dogs were infected with field CPV-2c, knowing that no CPV-2c vaccine is available yet in Mexico. Moreover, in Mexico, Pedroza and colleagues reported that the most common antigenic variant in infected dogs was CPV-2c [16] .",

The varying sensitivity of this test is its downside; several studies have indicated that its sensitivity ranges from 50 to 100% [8, 9] , and in our study, the comparative sensitivity with nPCR was 66.6%. Some studies have suggested that the low technique sensitivity is due to the need of a large viral particles quantities to be shed into the stool of dogs to obtain a positive diagnosis [5, 8, 10, 18] . The use of this technique must be reconsidered, as higher probability of false negative results is expected.
