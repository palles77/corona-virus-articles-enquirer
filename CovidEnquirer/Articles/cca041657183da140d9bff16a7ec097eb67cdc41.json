Rats receiving the virus at 9 days ol'age had an extensive spread of int'ection throughout the brain and the animals died after a few days. Rats inoculated at day I I postnatally survived and the infection was limited to the olfactory pathways, hypothalamus, diagonal bands and the anterior raphe nuclei. Stereological measurements showed that the volume of infected neurons constituted 67+ 10% of the total neuronal volume in the dorsal raphe nucleus. Doublelabelling experiments revealed that both 5-hydroxytryptamine-and substance P-immunoreactive neurons contained the virus antigen. The motor stimulant effect of amphetamine was studied at 3 months post infection. The increase in amphetamine-induced frequency and duration of rearing was significantly attenuated in infected rats and the amphetamine-induced locomotion was slightl~ reduced.",

Neurons in the diagonal bands, locus coeruleus and anterior raphe nuclei, which form part of the reticular core, project directly to the olfactory bulbs and can, via retrograde axonal transport, be labelled by tracers injected into the ollitctory bulb (Shipley and Adamek, 1984) or even instilled into the nasal cavity (Shipley, 1985) . These groups of neurons were also labelled by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) antigen following intranasal infection with the virus in mice (Lundh el al., 1987) . B\\ using a temperature-sensitive mutant (G41) o1\" VSV and the fact that olfactory spread of VSV is age-dependent (Sabin and Olitsky, 1937) a non-lethal infection involving these neurons was obtained in stickling mice (Lundh el al., 1988) . In ordcr to pcrl\\~rm corrclativc neurochemical and behavioural studies, infant rats were then infected and we have previously shown that intranasal instillation of the VSV mutant G41 results in a marked depletion of serotonin in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex with no substantial effects oll dopamine, noradrenaline, choline acetyltranst'erase and glutamate decarboxylase (Mohammed ~' 1 ~d., 1990 (Mohammed ~' 1 ~d., , 1991 . Behavioural changes induced by the infection included increased motor activity. Both the serotonergic raphe neurons and the dopaminergic nigro-cortical neurons have been implicated in arousal and motor activation (Fibiger and Campbell, 1971 : Lucot and Seiden, 1986 : Mabry and Campbell, 1974 . As a first step towards studying the behavioural pharmacology of VSVinduced hyperactivity, we examined the effect of amphetamine. This drug has been widely used as a tool to release monoaminergic transmitters from their axon terminals in studies on the ett'ects of monoamines on motor activity (for review sec Moore, 1974) . Here we present a detailed account of the distribution of VSV antigen in the rat brain and report that VSV antigen is present in a ma,iority of the anterior raphe neurons and that amphetamineinduced increase in duration and frequency of rearing was attenuated by VSV infection.",

The brains were dissected, postfixed for 90min, subsequently rinsed and kept in 10% sucrose for at least 24 h prior to cutting on a cryostat (Frigocut 2800E, Reichert-Jung, Germany). Four uninfected rats perfused at days 5 and 11 p.i. served as controls. Twelve gm thick sections, from more than 50 different levels of each brain, were stained with cresyl violet and mounted in Entellan (Merck, Germany). Viral antigen was demonstrated in adjacent sections by the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method (Sternberger, 1979 ) employing a sheep anti-VSV hyperimmune serum (kindly provided by Dr Jan Zfivada, Institute of Virology, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Czechoslovakia; for characterization and details of procedure see Lundh et al., 1988) .

Firstly, the volume density (I,/\",) of the neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus, i.e. their relative volume as compared to the total volume of the nucleus, was calculated in sections from six random levels of the dorsal raphe nucleus of each animal (infected and uninfected). This was done in order to evaluate if there was any cell loss in the raphe nuclei of the infected rats. Secondly, the volume density of the infected neurons, i.e. their relative volume as compared to the total volume of neurons, was determined. In addition, the absolute volume of the dorsal raphe nucleus was calculated. The volume of the infected neurons was calculated from micrographs of sections immunohistochemically labelled for virus antigen, whereas the total volume of nerve cells and the volume of the whole dorsal raphe nuclei was evaluated on adjacent cresyl violet-stained sections using a Reichert-Jung Visopan microscope.",

Thus, we recently found that VSV infection leading to lesion of the raphe system in rats caused persistent learning deficits in the Morris maze and impaired exploratory behaviour in the open field test (Mohammed et al.. 1990 (Mohammed et al.. , 1991 . In the present study, we subjected the rats to the psychomotor stimulant amphetamine. The motor stimulatory action of amphetaminc is mediated by diverse transmitter systems such as dopaminergic (Creese and lversen, 1975 : Kelly el al., 1975 : Shaywitz t,t a/., 1976 , noradrenergic (Mohammed el al.. 1986 ) and cholinergic (Robinson, 1986) neurons. Of interest to the present work are a number of studies demonstrating that the central action of amphetamine can be modified by manipulation also of the serotonergic system. The weight of evidence indicates that the locomotor stimulant effect of at-nphetamine is attenuated b 3 increased serotonergic transmission (Warbritton t't al., 1978; Carter and Pycock, 1978) and enhanced by blockade or destruction of the serotonin system The results demonstrate counts at 10-min intervals (left panel, presented as mean; SEM left out for the sake of clarity) as well as the cumulative counts for the entire 90-min test period (right panel, presented as mean-t-SEM).

However, with regard to rearing, there was a marked reduction of the amphetamine-induced increase in rearing scores observed in the VSV-infected animals. This was the case both for the frequency and the duration of rearing. Little is known about the neuronal basis of rearing. Rearing can be considered as a measure of exploratory behaviour (Archer, 1973) , which includes cognitive function and locomotion. Amphetamine increases rearing in a dosedependent manner locomotion (Sandberg cl a/.. 1987) . Most studies have considercd the locomotor component of amphetamine-induced activity and, as mentioned abo'~e, it appears that this aspect of motor behavtour is mainly tinder tile control of dopaminergic and serotonergic mechanisms. Our findings suggest that serotonergic neurons are critically involved in mediating aiTlphetamine-induced rearing. Since substance P-containing neurons, which are revolved in cognitive function (Huston and Oitzl, 1989; Hascn~:,hrl el al., 1990L were also infected, this subpopulatiori of neurons may have contributed to this efl'ect.

The nigrocortical and nigro-striatal dopaminergic neurons, which are known to control motor activity (Carlsson and Carlsson, 1990) were, however, not infected. We suggest therefore that the attenuation of amphetamine-induced rearing in VSV-infected rats is mainly due to the lesion of the raphe nuclei. Viruses can display a remarkable selectivity in their attack on nervous tissue (Johnson, 1980) , due to differences in routes of infection, in viral cell surface receptors and in host cell restrictions on virus multiplication. Although cellular recognition sites for VSV are considered to be a component of virtually all cells (Emerson, 1985) , this virus infects the neuroepithelia (olfactory mucosa and vomeronasal organ) and not the respiratory epithelium in the nasal cavity (Lundh et al., 1987) . In the brain, VSV infects the anterior optic nucleus and reticular core neurons projecting to the olfactory bulbs. In the present study, the majority of neurons in the diagonal bands and anterior raphe nuclei were attacked, and in the raphe nuclei both substance P and 5HT neurons were infected. Although the locus coeruleus was heavily infected in mice (Lundh et al., 1988) , this nucleus showed only minimal infection in the rat. Recently, a marked retrograde labelling of the diagonal bands, the anterior raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus was found after intranasal infection of herpes simplex virus type I in rats (McLean et al., 1989) , while a mutant strain of rabies virus (AvOl) showed no infection of the raphe nuclei after intranasal instillation, although the wild type did (LaFay et al., 1991 ) . The latter study illustrates that a selectivity in virus attack on groups of neurons projecting within the olfactory system can be obtained. Neither the wild type nor the mutant rabies virus infected the granular cells in the main olfactor3 bulb or the locus coeruleus, and the mutant, although it failed to infect the anterior olfactory nucleus (which the wild type did), gave rise to an extensive infection of the horizontal diagonal band. These studies indicate that there may be selectivity in the attack on the reticular core neurons projecting to the olfactory bulbs by different viruses spreading from the nasal cavity. Viruses and their mutants may, therefore, have potential as valuable tools in combined neurochemical and behaviour studies aimed at evaluating the neuroanatomical correlates of behaviour.",
