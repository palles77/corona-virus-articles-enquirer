We found that the secondary structure of the dimerization domain consists of five a helices and a b-hairpin. The dimer interface consists of a continuous four-stranded b-sheet superposed by two long a helices, reminiscent of that found in the nucleocapsid protein of porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus. Extensive hydrogen bond formation between the two hairpins and hydrophobic interactions between the b-sheet and the a helices render the interface highly stable. Sequence alignment suggests that other coronavirus may share the same structural topology.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is the first emerging infectious disease in the 21st century with a fatality rate of ca. 8% and is caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV) [1] . The nucleocapsid protein is a key component of the virus and is essential for virus formation. It binds to the viral RNA to form a ribonucleoprotein core, which can enter the host cell and interact with cellular processes [2] [3] [4] [5] . The free protein presumably exists as a dimer in solution, with the dimerization domain located at the C-terminus [6, 7] . We have previously defined the structural domains of the SARS-CoV N protein [8] . The C-terminal structural domain coincides with the dimerization domain identified in previous studies, and our biochemical studies showed that it exists as a dimer in solution. Denaturation studies have shown that dissociation of the SARS-CoV N protein is coupled with loss of structure, implying a structure-dependent mechanism for self-association [9] . Understanding this mechanism would not only provide insights into the viral assembly process, but also identify additional targets for drugs to combat SARS through disruption of N protein self-association. However, there has been no 3D structure of the dimerization domain of coronavirus N protein published and the underlining principle governing the self-association of coronavirus N protein dimer is also unknown. We have employed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques to investigate the structure of the dimerization domain of SARS-CoV N protein. We report our results in this communication.",

Sequential backbone resonance assignments for 1 H N , 15 N, 13 C a and 13 C b were derived from standard 3D HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, CBCANH, and CBCA(CO)NH experiments [13] . (H m )C m CH-TOCSY experiments were also obtained to correct for iso-tope effect on 13 C chemical shifts [14] . The assignments of H a and H b resonances were achieved from analysis of the HBHA(CO)NH spectrum. H(CC)(CO)NH, CC(CO)NH and HCCH-TOCSY spectra were analyzed to obtain side chain assignments. To identify the interface region involved in dimer interactions, F 1 [ 13 C, 15 N]-filtered, F 3 -15 N-edited and F 1 [ 13 C, 15 N]-filtered, F 3 -13 C-edited 3D NOESY-HSQC spectra were obtained using a (u-2 H, 13 C, 15 N)NP 248-365 (65% deuteration)/ NP 248-365 hetero-dimer sample prepared by mixing labeled NP 248-365 sample with equal amount of unlabeled NP 248-365 sample [15, 16] . The protein was denatured in 8 M urea and renatured by extensive dialysis in desired NMR buffer conditions. Data were processed with the XWINNMR suite and AURELIA software (Bruker, Germany) on SGI workstations or NMRPipe on Linux workstations [17] . The 1 H chemical shift was referenced to DSS at 0 ppm as suggested [18] .",

NP 248-365 is the most stable domain which retains the dimer structure. Shortening the fragment causes structural changes and lengthening the fragment has no effect on the structure of NP 248-365 . Backbone assignment for most amino acids of NP 248-365 was achieved except for residues located at the Nterminus and H301 (Fig. 1A) . Perdeuteration of NP 248-365 was necessary to obtain triple-resonance spectra due to short T 2 (transverse relaxation time) of the dimer. The secondary structure of NP 248-365 was determined from standard NMR parameters, such as the characteristic NOE patterns, the consensus chemical shift indices (CSI), the magnitude of the 3 J HNa value, and the H N exchange rates (Fig. 1B) . The result shows that NP 248-365 consists of five a-helices (A, Val271-Phe274; B, Gln290-Gln295; C, Trp302-Phe308; D, Ala312-Gly317 and E, Phe347-Ala360) and two b strands (b1: Arg320-Thr326; b2: Gly329-Leu340) (see Fig. 1C ).",

However, most H a , H b and aliphatic sidechain nuclei could be assigned from (H m )C m CH-TOCSY, HCCH-TOCSY and 13 C-edited NOESY spectra. Further analysis of the intramolecular dimer-interface NOEs identified a number of contacts between the two b strands, which allowed us to define the b hairpin structure (Fig. 2A) . This information allowed us to manually assign the intermolecular NOEs at the dimer interface from analysis of the F 1 [ 13 C, 15 N]-filtered, F 3 -15 N-edited and F 1 [ 13 C, 15 N]-filtered, F 3 -13 C-edited 3D NOESY-HSQC spectra using u-( 2 H, 13 C, 15 N)NP 248-365 (65% deuteration)/unlabeled-NP 248-365 sample. Our results indicate that the dimer interface is composed of a continuous fourstranded b-sheet, formed by extensive hydrogen bond interactions between the two long b strands of the two b-hairpins, contributed one from each of the two monomers (Figs. 2B and 3A). The dimer is further stabilized by hydrophobic interactions between residues on one side of the amphipathic long helix E and the b-sheet (Fig. 3B) . The presence of the extensive interactions between the two monomers in a dimer provides strong stabilization force and explains why the two monomers cannot be separated without denaturing the protein, even though there is no cysteine in the dimerization domain to form a covalent disulfide bond. This arrangement is reminiscent of the dimer-interface of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) nucleocapsid protein (Fig. 3C ) [19] , the coat protein of bacteriophage MS2 (Fig. 3D) [19] and the peptide recognition domain of the human histocompatibility antigen (HLA) [20, 21] .",

However, we show that there are common principles that underlie the architecture of a nucleocapsid protein in both SARS-CoV and PRRSV. They both contain two regions, one for RNA-binding and the other for dimerization or oligomerization [8, 23] , albeit the two domains in SARS-CoV N protein is linked by a much longer flexible linker of 120 a.a. Most importantly, the structures of the dimer interface of the two viruses are very similar. The presence of extensive interactions in the dimer interface may render this dimer interface to become self-contained, i.e., it is less likely to be dependent on the global structure of the protein. In fact, we have found that a.a. NP 281-365 still retained dimerization potential, even though structural differences were evident from NMR spectra (Fig. 4) . Similar observations have been reported in the literature [6] . It is evident that the tight dimer interface structure permits certain extended perturbation in the global structure without affecting the dimer structure. Such characteristics make this particular fold ideal as a common building block for dimer interfaces in a variety of proteins.",

Sequence alignment coupled with secondary structure prediction show that many share the bba topology observed in SARS-CoV (Fig. 5 ). In particular, the long b-strand and the long C-terminal helix are predicted to be present in all cases. Most of them also contain the short b-strand, with the exceptions of BCoV, HCoV and PHEV. These results raise the possibility that all coronavirus employ the same interface mechanism for dimerization and they belong to the same structural class, however this cannot be verified by the class-dependent prediction algorithm because of the lack of known tertiary structure [26] .",

The topology closely resembles that of the PRRSV nucleocapsid protein and the coat protein of bacteriophage MS2. This type of dimer interfaces is highly stable and could serve as one of the common building blocks for dimer interfaces in nature. Sequence alignment and secondary structure prediction suggest that other coronavirus N proteins also adopt a similar dimerization mechanism.",

The stripes on the left panel were selected from the F 1 [ 13 C, 15 N]-filtered, F 3 -15 N-edited 3D NOESY-HSQC spectrum and the stripes on the the right panel were selected from the F 1 [ 13 C, 15 N]-filtered, F 3 -13 C-edited 3D NOESY-HSQC. (B) NOE connectivities of the b-sheet forming the dimer interface. The shaded arrows and the connecting loops represent the two b hairpins of the two monomers. The two-headed arrows show the observed NOE pairs and the dotted lines are the proposed hydrogen bonds stabilizing the b hairpins, as well as the dimer interface between the two b hairpins. The dotted rectangular boxes represent the positions of the two helices which interact with the four-stranded b-sheet. The boxed residues are those involved in hydrophobic interaction with the helices. The NOEs between b1 and b2 (also b1 0 and b2 0 in the other monomer) were obtained from 3D 15 N-NOESY-HSQC spectrum of u-15 N-NP 248-365 sample and the interfacial NOEs between b2 and b2 0 were obtained from 15 Nfiltered 3D NOESY-HSQC spectrum of sample containing u-( 2 H, 13 C, 15 N)-NP 248-365 (65% Deuteration)/unlabeled NP 248-365 hetero-dimer.",
