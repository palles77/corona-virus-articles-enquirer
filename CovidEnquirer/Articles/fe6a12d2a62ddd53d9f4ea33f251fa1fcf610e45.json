Phosphorylation of Akt occurs early during JUNV infection of Vero cells and is blocked by the PI3K inhibitor, Ly294002. Infection of cells with UV-irradiated JUNV redeemed the pattern of stimulation observed for infectious virus indicating that an early stage of multiplication cycle would be enough to trigger activation. Treatment of cells with chlorpromazine abrogated phosphorylation of Akt upon JUNV infection suggesting virus internalization as responsible for activation. Inhibition of Akt phosphorylation by Ly294002 impaired viral protein synthesis and expression leading to a reduced infectious virus yield without blocking the onset of persistent stage of infection. This impairment is linked to a reduced amount of virus bound to cells probably due to a blockage on the recycling of transferrin cell-receptor, employed by the virus to adsorb to the cell surface. Early Akt activation was also observed in BHK-21 and A549 JUNV infected cells suggesting an important role of PI3K/Akt signalling in JUNV multiplication in vitro.",

            "text": "Jun\u00edn virus (JUNV), agent of the Argentine haemorrhagic fever, belongs to the Arenaviridae family, a group of enveloped viruses with genome composed of two negative-sense single stranded RNA segments (L and S) that encode genes of viral proteins, N, L, GPC (G1 and G2) and Z, using an ambisense coding strategy (Buchmeier, 2002; Meyer et al., 2002) . Previous findings suggest that arenavirus pathogenesis could well involve the dysregulation of cytokines and immune signalling controlled by the initial response to activation of a series of phosphorylation events (Bowick et al., 2007) . However, it is not well understood how arenaviruses induce cell-signalling changes, which lead to this dysregulation and potentially to clinical disease. Many viruses have evolved mechanisms to gain control of key cellular signalling pathways that affect broad aspects of cellular macromolecular synthesis, metabolism, growth and survival. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) is one of such pathways promoting cell survival by phosphorylation and inhibition of a number of pro-apoptotic proteins. Both DNA and RNA viruses must regulate this pathway, either by activating or inactivating some aspect of it, in order to achieve an efficient replication process (Cooray, 2004; Buchkovich et al., 2008) .",

To this end, Vero 181 cells were infected with JUNV strain XJCl3 and further incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 15, 30 and 60 min when cultures were processed for Western blotting (WB). For later samples (90, 120 and 240 min p.i.), virus was removed after 60 min of viruscell contact and serum free medium was added to the cultures. Time zero post-infection (p.i.) corresponds to the inoculation time point. Proteins from whole-cell lysates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a PVDF membrane, as previously described (Ellenberg et al., 2004) and revealed by using an anti-phospho-Akt antibody. Membranes were stripped and re-probed with anti-Akt total antibody to assure equal protein loading. As can be seen in Fig. 1a , infection with JUNV induced early Akt activation, peaking at 15-30 min p.i., sustaining thereafter a moderate level of phosphorylation up to 120 min p.i. which decreased at 240 min p.i., when the level of phosphorylated Akt of infected cells showed a faint band slightly darker than mock infected control ( Fig. 1a and  b) . A similar result was obtained in JUNV infected BHK-21 cells (Fig. 1c) .",

            "text": "Taken into consideration that Akt activation was an early event during infection, we speculated this activation might be due to the initial virus-host cell interactions. To test this hypothesis we inoculated Vero cells, under the same conditions described above, with UV-irradiated JUNV, prepared by exposing infectious virus suspended in PBS to a 30 W UV light at a distance of 10 cm for 3 min. Inactivation of virus was inferred from the fact that Vero cells infected with UV-inactivated JUNV were not able to express and processed for WB at indicated times p.i. Vero cells treated with 10 M Ly294002 (f) were infected with JUNV at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell and processed for WB at 30 min p.i. Phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473) was determined by WB in whole-cell lysates using a phospho-Akt (Ser473) (CST 9271, New England Biolabs) or total Akt (CST 9272, New England Biolabs) antibodies. Fold change of Akt phosphorylation was expressed as densitometric units (Scion Image software) of band normalized to the total Akt level relative to the uninfected control from of each panel. All experiments were performed on 24 h serum starved cells, and the infection and treatments were carried out in serum free medium. viral proteins detected by WB and failed to yield infectious virus quantified by plaque assay (data not shown). As can be seen in Fig. 1d , UV-irradiated JUNV also led to an early Akt phosphorylation event occurring at 15-30 min p.i. at a level of stimulation comparable to that obtained with control virus (Fig. 1a) suggesting that an early step of JUNV multiplication would be responsible for Akt activation. Activation of Akt by initial virus-host cell interactions has been also described for HIV (Briand et al., 1997) and enterovirus 71 (Wong et al., 2005) . This was consistent with the fact that when we analyzed the activation of Akt by transferrin (Tf), a ligand for the receptor employed by JUNV to enter into many cell types (Flanagan et al., 2008; Radoshitzky et al., 2007) , a similar kinetics of Akt activation was observed (data not shown). Moreover, the pattern of Akt activation induced by JUNV and Tf was also reported for the interaction between the insulin-like growth factor type I receptor (IGF-IR) and its ligand. Previous reports showed that this receptor co-localizes with Tf receptor in endosomes and recycles in a similar fashion depending on and sustaining, at the same time, The fact that the level of phosporylation of Akt in JUNV infected cells analyzed at later times p.i. (6, 12 and 18 h p.i.) did not differ from non-infected cultures prompted us to conclude that activation of this pathway was not dependant on JUNV protein synthesis (data not shown).",

Alternatively, cells grown in coverslips treated under the same conditions mentioned above, were fixed with methanol during 15 min at \u221220 \u2022 C and processed for IFA, as previously described (Ellenberg et al., 2004) , employing anti-N Mab SA02-BG12 (Sanchez et al., 1989) . As shown in Fig. 2b , treatment of infected cells with Ly294002 led to an inhibition of N expression, detected by IFA, reaching 85 and 87% of inhibition for Vero and BHK-21 cells, respectively. To note, although N fluorescence pattern in treated cells remained unchanged, proportion and fluorescence intensity of positive cells was markedly reduced compared to untreated control cells. Similarly, as can be seen in Fig. 2c , inhibition of N synthesis, detected by WB, was in accordance with the results mentioned above. Also, the presence of Ly294002 in A549 JUNV infected cells reduced the synthesis and expression of N, suggesting that this phenomenon is not dependent on cell origin (data not shown). These results, indicating the participation of PI3K/Akt pathway in JUNV multiplication, were confirmed when a dominant-negative mutant for Akt was employed (Murga et al., 1998) . As can be seen in Fig. 2d , JUNV infection of Vero cells that had been previously transfected with a pCEFL vector encoding wild-type Akt (PKB-wt) showed a higher proportion of cells bearing both green (Akt) and red (N) fluorescence (62 \u00b1 5%) in comparison with infected cells transfected with a kinase-inactive mutant of Akt (PKB-kd) which showed a reduced percentage of cells bearing both fluorescent marks (13 \u00b1 8%) (p < 0.01), suggesting that dominant-negative mutant of Akt impaired N synthesis. This situation also leaded to a reduced viral yield of infected cells that had been previously transfected with the dominant-negative mutant (Fig. 2e) . On the contrary, vesicular stomatitis virus multiplication was not affected by the dominant-negative mutant in accordance with previous results demonstrating that this virus is not affected by Ly294002 (Saeed et al., 2008) .",

(Fig. 2f) indicating that requirement for PI3K activity in JUNV multiplication cycle is restricted to the early stages of infection. This was confirmed when the initial steps of the multiplication cycle were studied in a combined assay. To this end, Vero cells were infected with JUNV in the presence or not of Ly294002, and incubated at 37 \u2022 C in order to allow adsorption, penetration and uncoating of virions. At different incubation times cells were washed with cold PBS, lysed by freeze-thawing and infectivity quantified by plaque assay. As can be seen in Fig. 2g a maximum value of internalized infectivity was observed at 30 min post-contact for treated and untreated cells as well, followed by a decrease in a time course dependant manner in both cases. This result indicates that uncoating occurred in control and treated cells at a similar rate, however, the amount of cell-associated virus was significantly lower in the case of cells treated with Ly294002 suggesting an impairment in the uptake of virus to treated cells. As mentioned above and considering that JUNV uses transferrin receptor to adsorb to cells, blockage of recycling of transferrin receptor caused by Ly294002 might account for the diminished levels of cell associated virus. In fact, non-infected Vero cells incorporated labelled transferrin that accumulated after 30 min of contact around the nucleous defining an intense perinuclear region whereas Ly294002 treated cultures showed a low intensity punctuate pattern scattered in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2h) . These results allow us to speculate that impairment of JUNV adsorption to Vero cells treated with Ly294002 might be due a blockage in transferrin receptor recycling. To test this hypothesis, Vero cells treated with Ly294002 were incubated with transferrin (in order to obtain cell surfaces depleted of transferrin receptors), and further infected with JUNV. As can be seen in Fig. 2i , a significant reduction in virus titer was observed in Ly294002 treated cells that had been incubated with transferrin suggesting that recycling of transferrin receptor is necessary for an optimal virus binding to cells. Treatment of cultures with Ly294002 per se did not affect binding of JUNV to Vero cells (Fig. 2i ). This finding may be explained by the fact that when an infection is carried out at a low MOI it would be enough the presence of one cell-receptor to allow virus adsorption.",

A direct effect on Akt phosporylation inhibition, mediated by Ly294002, on GTPase Rab5, a known regulator of early endosome fusion (Li et al., 1995) , cannot be discarded, however the observation that JUNV is able to uncoat in Ly294002 treated cells does not support this idea.",

We observed that impairment of viral multiplication by Ly294002 did not affect establishment of persistence. The reduced proportion of infected cells that remained after a two weeks Ly294002 treatment, led to the establishment of persistently infected cultures characterized by a continuous synthesis of N and reduced levels of infectivity, suggesting the drug was not able to modify the transition from acute to persistent infection (data not shown). It remains to be elucidated the role of Akt in the maintenance of this stage of infection, particularly focused on control of . At 24 h p.i. supernatants were collected and virus titer was calculated by plaque assay. Alternatively, cells treated under the same conditions mentioned above were fixed with methanol and subjected to IFA (b) or processed for WB (c) to determine N synthesis and expression. Values in b) indicate % of inhibition calculated from amounts of fluorescence intensities (ImagePro-Express software) in treated cells in comparison to untreated controls. Similar numbers of total cells were analyzed for each category. Vero cells transfected either with pCEFL vector encoding wild-type Akt (PKB-wt) or a kinase-inactive mutant (PKB-kd) were infected with JUNV at an MOI of 10 PFU/cell at 24 h post-transfection and fixed at 24 h p.i. with methanol for IFA, employing anti-N (red fluorescence) and anti-Akt (green fluorescence) antibodies. Values in merge panels indicate % of cells bearing both colors (approx. 150 cells bearing similar levels of Akt expression were scored in duplicate coverslips). After 24 h of infection, virus yield was determined by plaque assay, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was employed as a negative control (e). Vero cells infected with JUNV at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell were treated at different times p.i. with 10 M Ly294002, further incubated up to 24 h p.i. and virus yield quantified by plaque assay (f). Vero cells were infected with JUNV at an MOI of 10 PFU/cell in the presence or absence of 10 M Ly294002, incubated at 37 \u2022 C and lysed by freeze and thawing at different times post-inoculation (g). Internalized virus in cell lysates was quantified by plaque assay. Vero cells treated or not with 10 M Ly294002 were incubated with TRITC-labeled transferrin (SIGMA) and processed for IFA at 15 and 30 min post-contact (h). Vero cells previously incubated with 20 g/ml transferrin (Tf) or 10 M Ly294002 (Ly) or both transferrin and Ly294002 (Ly + Tf) were infected with approx. 150 PFU of JUNV and overlayed with plaquing medium (i).

Taken into consideration that TSG101 is regulated by Akt through MDM2 phophorylation (Mayo and Donner, 2001) , which in turn ubiquitinates the p53 tumor supression protein, tagging it for degradation and leading to an anti-apoptotic scenario (Zhou et al., 2001) , it is tempting to speculate that activation and stabilization of MDM2 by PI3K/Akt pathway and TSG101, respectively, might be critical to define the fate of JUNV multiplication in persistently infected cells.",
