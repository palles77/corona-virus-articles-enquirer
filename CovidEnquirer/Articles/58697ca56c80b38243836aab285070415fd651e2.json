When the virulent Purdue strain of TGEV was used, villous atrophy was seen and TGEV antigen was demonstrated immunohistochemically in the villous enterocytes. The Miller M6 strain of virus produced less extensive lesions in the segments, but since it was titratable by plaque assay it was used in the subsequent yield reduction assays to determine the antiviral activity of interferon. When intestinal segments were inoculated simultaneously with either 3200 units of natural porcine interferon-a or up to 100000 units of recombinant human interferon-a2a, and TGEV, there were no reductions in virus yield, although the same cytokines exerted an antiviral effect in ST ceils treated in a similar way. However, virus yields were significantly reduced in intestinal segments in piglets treated parenterally with the synthetic interferon inducer polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid 6 hours before challenge of the segments with TGEV. There was also a trend for the antiviral effects of interferon induction before challenge to be augmented by the inclusion of interferon with the virus inoculum. It was concluded that interferon would be ineffective as a therapeutic for TGEV, although it might be useful prophylactically.",

            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is an enteric coronavirus associated with high mortality in preweaning pigs. Following oral exposure, viral replication occurs primarily in the mature villous epithelium of the jejunum and ileum (Hooper and Haelterman, 1969, Saif and Heckert, 1990 ). Lysis of infected cells leads to villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia. Diarrhoea results from maldigestion, malabsorption, and loss of electrolytes and proteins from the damaged epithelium and leads to dehydration, nutritional deficiency, and electrolyte imbalances (Butler, et al., 1974) . Antiviral activity associated with TGEV infection was first described in intestinal washings in neonatal pigs (Pensaert et al., 1970) . The activity was later shown to be due to alpha interferon (IFN-a) (La Bonnardi~re and Laude, 1981 ) . The source of the interferon was unknown, but was thought to be the gut associated lymphoid tissue. More recently it has been shown that IFN-ot induction is dependent on the TGEV transmembrane protein E1 Laude, 1988, Laude et al., 1992) , and that IFN-t~ is produced by lamina propria lymphocytes exposed to TGEV (Naidoo and Derbyshire, 1992) . The role of the endogenous IFN produced early in the course of infection with TGEV is not currently understood. By virtue of its antiviral activity, it may restrict further cycles of viral replication in the intestinal epithelium, and the major objective of the present study was to investigate this possibility in a ligated intestinal segment model in which exogenous IFN-a could be injected into the intestinal segments concurrently with the infecting virus.",

While less virulent than the Purdue strain, the Miller M6 strain was capable of replicating in the intestinal segments, in contrast to vaccine strains of TGEV which were evaluated in preliminary experiments (results not shown). Antigenic and nucleotide sequencing data have established the close relationship between porcine and human alpha interferons (La Bonnardi~re, et al., 1986; Lef'evre and La Bonnardi~re, 1986; Lef'evre, et al., 1990; Weingartl, 1989 ) . Human interferon has been shown to have antiviral activity in non-human cells (Gresser, et al., 1974) . Human interferon has also been shown to have activity against feline infectious peritonitis virus, a coronavirus closely related to TGEV (Weiss and Oostram-Ram, 1989 ). Oral treatment with human IFN has been reported to decrease rotavirus shedding in pigs (Lecce, et al., 1992 ) . Previous reports have described the reduction in TGEV yield following treatment with both porcine and bovine IFN of both cell and intestinal explant cultures (Maclachlan and Anderson, 1986; Derbyshire, 1989; Weingartl and Derbyshire, 1990) . Of particular interest in the present study was the demonstration that post-treatment of ST cell cultures after virus inoculation with a low multiplicity of virus would result in some decrease in subsequent virus yield. In the intestinal segment experiments, however, the simultaneous treatment ofenterocytes with Po IFN-ot or Hu rec IFN-o~2a and TGEV did not cause a decrease in virus yield. It is possible that the kinetics of viral replication and/or the kinetics of the IFN system differ in enterocytes relative to ST cells in culture such that viral replication is well underway by the time an effective antiviral state is induced. It is also possible that the IFN inoculum was being degraded by intestinal proteases, despite the inclusion of a protease inhibitor in the inoculum.",

This present study demonstrated that in addition to the activation of natural killer cells, previously described by Lesnick and Derbyshire (1988) poly ICLC treatment will result in a decreased TGEV yield in enterocytes. This may be a factor in the delay in onset of clinical signs associated with poly ICLC treatment (Loewen and Derbyshire, 1988a) . It is not certain whether the reduced virus yield in the intestinal segments of the poly-ICLC treated piglets resulted from a direct antiviral effect of the induced IFN on the enterocytes, or by lysis of enterocytes early in infection by NK cells, activated by the induced IFN. The latter mechanism seems less likely, since the intestinal segments were infected with TGEV well before NK activity would have peaked (Lesnick and Derbyshire, 1988) . A more direct effect, through the induction of an antiviral state in the enterocytes, seems more likely. It has been shown that 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase is induced during TGEV infection, and is also produced in IFN treated porcine cell cultures (Bosworth, et al., 1989; Bosworth and Maclachlan, 1990 ).",
