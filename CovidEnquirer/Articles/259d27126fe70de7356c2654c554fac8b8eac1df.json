The wet form is characterised by the development of fluid in one or more of the body cavities, and the dry form by the development of granulomatous lesions in various organ systems. The disease is caused by a coronavirus, FIPV. The virus has proved difficult to isolate from infected cats in cell cultures, and this has hampered studies on the virus-host interactions; until relatively recently, most experiments were performed using tissue suspensions from infected cats. However, in recent years several successful iso-lations in cell cultures have been made (O'Reilly et al., 1979; Black, 1980; McKeirnan et al., 1981; Hitchcock et al., 1981; Pedersen et al., 1981 ) . Although these isolates have been used to reproduce the disease experimentally, the virus has proved difficult to recover from experimental animals, so there is little information on the shedding patterns exhibited by infected animals, which would be helpful in determining the epidemiology of the disease.",

(1982) showed the presence of circulating immune complexes in cats with FIP and depletion of the C3 component of complement. In addition, it appears that humoral immunity to the virus may be non-protective. Thus, in experimental studies, the majority of inoculated cats develop clinical signs and these animals, like naturally occurring cases, generally have high titres of antiviral antibody . Moreover, it has been shown that vaccination with sub-lethal doses of FIPV, or administration of antibody to cats prior to infection with FIPV, exacerbates the disease ( Pedersen and Boyle, 1980) . This has led to the suggestion that cell-mediated immunity is probably more important than humoral immunity in protection from this disease (Pedersen and Black, 1983 ) .",

In this study, virus was shed from the oropharynx and the faeces irrespective of the route of administration. Virus shedding was generally detected in the oropharyngeal swabs before being detected in faeces. The start of virus shedding from the oropharynx coincided with pyrexia. The exact significance of this is unknown, but it suggests that virus generalization had occurred with subsequent localisation in tissues of the oropharynx and then the gut. Indeed, in the parenterally-inoculated group, this would presumably be the only mechanism by which virus could arrive at these sites, whereas in the orally-inoculated group direct contact with target tissues cannot be ruled out.",

The reasons for this are unclear, and it would be interesting to unravel the immune mechanisms operating at this time. No virus was detected in oropharyngeal swabs or faecal samples taken later than the 15th day after infection. However, in all but 2 cats, monitoring ceased shortly after this time when the cats developed clinical signs and were destroyed. Since viral shedding occurred before most cats showed any clinical signs of FIP, this may partly explain why the virus is difficult to isolate from clinical cases, since the majority of them are probably examined after viral shedding has ceased. It is also possible that the virus may be entirely cell-associated when the clinical signs arise (Weiss and Scott, 1981a, b) . Re-isolation of virus in the present study may have been facilitated by the use of a strain of FIPV which grows readily in cell culture to a high titre, and by prompt inoculation of culture with fresh material.",

The nature of such a carrier state and whether or not such animals are infectious to other cats is not known. However, in the present study, no virus shedding was detected in the one recovered cat monitored for 4 weeks after the initial episode of virus shedding had ceased. In addition, in other studies (Stoddart, 1986) an SPF cat placed in contact for 2 years with another recovered experimental cat failed to seroconvert. In contrast, when several other SPF cats were placed in contact with a colony with endemic FIP, but with no overt disease, seroconversion occurred over a period of 6 months, but no disease (Stoddart, 1986) .

Following infection with FIPV, the con A response which gives an indication of non-specific cellular activity was profoundly reduced, and only recovered to and maintained pre-inoculation levels in the cat that survived the infection. The reason for the disappearance of con A responsiveness is not known at present.",

The development of a blastogenic response to FIPV may, therefore, correlate with an ability to combat infection, but this type of assay merely measures the ability of cells to respond to antigen. However, even allowing for the limitations of the test, the results presented here provide some support for the hypothesis that cell-mediated immunity is important in protection against FIPV ( Pedersen and Black, 1983) . Further work using more sophisticated tests for cell-mediated immunity needs to be done.",
