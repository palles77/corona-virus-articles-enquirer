Vaccination does not alleviate consideration of gamma globulin prophylaxis for the nonimmune physician after accidental glove puncture. The nonimmune der- Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology matologist should carefully consider HBV immunization, which appears to be safe and effective without deleterious long-term side effects. Dermatologists and their assistants performing surgery associated with aerosol dispersion, such as dermabrasion, should be immunized if they are HBsAg-and antiHBs-negative. Meanwhile, molecular engineering, with the insertion of HBsAg genes into microorganisms, may result in an even safer and less expensive vaccine.* ",
