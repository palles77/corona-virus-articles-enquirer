            "text": "The study of cell-population heterogeneity in a range of biological systems, from viruses to bacterial isolates to tumor samples, has been transformed by recent advances in sequencing throughput. While the high-coverage afforded can be used, in principle, to identify very rare variants in a population, existing ad hoc approaches frequently fail to distinguish true variants from sequencing errors. We report a method (LoFreq) that models sequencing run-specific error rates to accurately call variants occurring in <0.05% of a population. Using simulated and real datasets (viral, bacterial and human), we show that LoFreq has near-perfect specificity, with significantly improved sensitivity compared with existing methods and can efficiently analyze deep Illumina sequencing datasets without resorting to approximations or heuristics. We also present experimental validation for LoFreq on two different platforms (Fluidigm and Sequenom) and its application to call rare somatic variants from exome sequencing datasets for gastric cancer. Source code and executables for LoFreq are freely available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/lofreq/.",

            "text": "Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled more widespread study of heterogeneity and subpopulations in a cell population, and a migration away from a 'consensus sequence' view of their evolution. Such a 'population perspective' has applications in a range of biological systems, from the characterization of viral quasi species and intra-host variation (1, 2) , to bacterial sub-populations (3) (4) (5) , to sub-clonal evolution in cancer (6) (7) (8) . Precise characterization of population structure (and rare sub-populations) in these studies is fundamental to the analysis of population evolution and dynamics as a function of host response or drug exposure. Several recent cancer sequencing studies have further emphasized the functional role of rare sub-populations and variants in aspects such as tumor growth, drug resistance and metastasis (9, 10) and the need for computational tools to study them.",

While approaches to correct for these have been studied, the majority of variant-calling methods have focused on low-coverage human re-sequencing data and diploid calls (14) (15) (16) with discrete frequencies of interest (i.e. 0, 0.5 and 1; a related set of methods are those tailored for calling diploid genotypes in pooled sequencing data (17) (18) (19) (20) and are not generally applicable).",

RNA viruses have high mutation rates (due to poor or missing proof-reading capability of the viral RNA-dependent DNA polymerase) and high replication rates, and the resulting intra-host variations have implications for drug treatment strategies (25) and the genetic monitoring of live vaccines (26) . The methods used in these studies though rely on ad hoc trimming, filtering and thresholds to call variants, limiting their sensitivity and widespread applicability (needing manual adjustment per sample or sequencing run). Recent modelbased approaches such as Breseq (27, 28) and SNVer (29) are potentially more sensitive and generic, but rely on simple binomial models and are not tailored to accommodate biases in error rates. A more sophisticated approach, that relies on phasing to reduce the effect of sequencing errors and is tailored to 454 sequencing has recently been applied to viral datasets (30) . This method is, however, not directly applicable to other technologies and cannot be run on large genomes or sequencing datasets.",

The resulting method, LoFreq, adapts automatically to sequencing run and positionspecific sequencing biases and can call SNVs at a frequency lower than the average sequencing error rate in a dataset. LoFreq's robustness, sensitivity and specificity were validated using several simulated and real datasets (viral, bacterial and human) and on two experimental platforms (Fluidigm and Sequenom).

Primer pairs were designed to generate multiple overlapping polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragments, roughly 2 kb in size. PCR was performed using the PfuUltra TM II Fusion HS DNA Polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The fragments were gel extracted from 1% agarose gel prepared in 1\u00c2 TBE buffer and the concentrations were measured using the NanoDrop ND 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Equal concentration of DNA products of each sample was combined and fragmented into a peak size range of 100-300 bp using the Covaris S2 (Covaris, Woburn, MA, USA) (shearing conditions-duty cycle: 20%; intensity: 5; cycles per burst: 200 and time: 110 s).

These datasets allowed us to investigate the performance of the various methods as a function of sequencing coverage (from 50\u00c2 to 10 000\u00c2). Overall, the heuristic approaches performed poorly in terms of sensitivity (Goto et al.) or PPV (Wright et al.) , while all the model-based approaches (SNVer, Breseq and LoFreq) had perfect PPV and therefore perfect specificity (Table 1) . LoFreq was also the most sensitive method with perfect specificity and called 96% of variants at 0.2% frequency with 10 000\u00c2 coverage (compared with 0 and 8% for SNVer and Breseq, respectively). As expected, with lower coverage, sensitivity fell for all methods but LoFreq continued to improve on results from SNVer and Breseq.

In this analysis, all methods did well in terms of reproducibility (% of SNVs called in at least two replicates) but LoFreq was the most sensitive among them, calling twice as many variants on average compared with SNVer (Table 2) . For robustness, LoFreq results on the pooled data were nearly a superset of the individual calls (Supplementary Figure S1 ) and were as robust as the calls for SNVer ( Table 2 ). The analysis here suggests that sensitivity is the major limiting factor for variant callers. In addition, the presence of SNVs seen in two or more replicates, but not in all six replicates (Supplementary Figure S1) , suggests that sequencing coverage may be a bottleneck to fully capture true variants in the population.",

With over 4.6 million positions, the E. coli genome provides a larger test case and with simulated reads, LoFreq reported no false-positive calls. From the sequencing data, Breseq, LoFreq and SNVer reported 79, 2 and 0, potentially false-positive variants, respectively. It is possible that some of these SNVs are in fact real as it is known that 'clonal' bacterial populations evolve under laboratory conditions (27) , maintaining variation even in equilibrium conditions in chemostats (39, 40) .

Interestingly, we found that LoFreq's predictions were an almost perfect superset of those made by samtools (>99.7% of samtools predictions are shared with LoFreq), while >14% of LoFreq's predictions were unique to it. Overall, LoFreq had similar precision as samtools (PPV = 99.8% for both methods and datasets), but higher sensitivity ($99% versus $95% on both datasets) as measured on a SNP array (see 'Materials and Methods' section). These results provide the basis for applying LoFreq to sensitively and accurately call somatic variants from paired tumor/normal sequencing datasets (as discussed later) and note that this comparison is not meant to suggest that LoFreq can be used a genotype caller, as is the case for samtools.",

Also, when compared with a naive version for computing exact P-values (see 'Materials and Methods' section), LoFreq's pruned-dynamic-programming approach is also an order of magnitude faster (Supplementary Figure S2) .

Strikingly, LoFreq predictions were validated in all experiments (nine out of nine valid calls; Figure 1d ) with the rarest SNV detected by LoFreq being just <0.5% in frequency. Also, the frequencies estimated by LoFreq were within the experimentally predicted ranges in all cases. In contrast, Breseq was correct in seven out of nine predictions while SNVer was only able to correctly call two of the higher frequency variants (Figure 1d ). Despite being the most conservative variant caller on the simulated datasets, SNVer had two false-positive calls on this dataset. As an additional validation, we designed an experiment on the Sequenom MassArray iPLEX platform for testing 92 variant positions in 18 clinical and 4 cell-culture dengue virus samples (see 'Materials and Methods' section). In total, 1474 variant position/sample combinations were tested in this experiment. All calls made by Sequenom MassArray were also captured in the results from LoFreq (5/5) indicating that the Type II error rate for LoFreq is likely to be low. SNVer also detected all five calls and Breseq detected four out of five calls. These results highlight the fact that LoFreq calls (and SNVer's) are likely to be at least as sensitive as this commonly used mass-spectrometry-based gold-standard for validating SNVs.",

In addition, since tumor samples are often contaminated with normal tissue, the ability to robustly detect somatic mutations can be critical. In particular, results from a samtools analysis of 14 exome sequencing datasets for gastric tumor/normal paired samples from Zang et al. (32) revealed an asymmetric frequency distribution for the somatic SNVs called, suggesting that sample contamination can lead to significantly reduced sensitivity even with high sequencing coverage (Supplementary Figure S4) .

Since the putative mechanism of action of the drug is to lead to mutations in cytosine bases (C > N mutagen by inhibition of CMP incorporation (49) ), this dataset provides an ideal test-bed for studying quasi species dynamics of the dengue virus using samples from two time points (Table 3 ). In particular, an important conclusion of the original study was that Our results indicate that no significant changes can be seen in this frequency for any serotype (Mann-Whitney test, Pvalue > 0.3), providing a molecular basis for the in vivo conclusion of this study. Despite this, we do detect other changes in viral intra-host variation, including an increase in the number of SNVs at later time points, as expected (one-sided Mann-Whitney test P-value < 0.007 for DENV1 placebo group), as well as the disappearance of a mutational hotspot in NS3 (see 'Materials and Methods' section) at a later time point, possibly due to adaptation to the host's immune response (Figure 3 ). We further leveraged the SNVs called with LoFreq to systematically determine mutational cold-spots and hotspot regions in DENV1 and DENV2 (Figure 3 ; see 'Materials and Methods' section). Interestingly, these features differ substantially between the two serotypes, with the exception of a shared cold-spot in the membrane glycoprotein precursor protein (prM), known to be critical for assembly and secretion of all flavivirus virions (50) . This region was only recently shown to be As shown, while germline variants are consistently distributed around 50% (as expected for heterozygous variants), somatic variants are shifted to lower frequencies, likely due to contamination in the tumor sample from normal stromal tissue. Note that while samtools-based somatic calls appear 'clipped' at lower frequencies, LoFreq calls are symmetrically distributed as expected. The samples analyzed here were collected as part of a drug-trial study for the nucleoside-analog Balapiravir (31) . Numbers in parentheses report the total number of samples sequenced, while un-parenthesized numbers report the number of pairs (a pre-and a post-dose sample) that were sequenced.",

Comparison of clinical and cell-culture samples for DENV2 also revealed a shared hotspot in the known variable region of the 3-UTR (52), which has been shown to be dispensable for replication in some host cell types (53) . The value of cold-spot and hotspot analysis for identifying functionally important residues can also be seen from a structural perspective (Figure 4 ). For example, when viewed on the structure of the NS5 methyltransferase (Figure 4a) , a first group of cold-spots consists of contiguous residues completely enclosing the binding site of the S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) molecule that serves as a methyl donor for the reaction catalyzed by NS5 for capping of viral mRNAs, while a second group of cold-spots corresponds to the carboxyl end which acts as the linker region that connects to the NS5 polymerase domain. Similarly, a representation of cold-spots on the NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain (Figure 4b ) encompasses the critical GDD catalytic triad and also most of the template tunnel through which the viral RNA substrate enters or exits during replication. Another example showing cold-spots and hotspots on the NS3 serine protease and helicase, delineating potential interaction surfaces and key resides can be found in Supplementary Figure S6 . Our results here suggest that sequencing and characterizing the intra-host variation in a relatively small set of samples can be sufficient for such analysis and reveal candidate drug targets (cold-spots) as well as fast-evolving regions in the viral genome (hotspots) that can be used to estimate haplotype diversity, avoiding the computational complexity of the problem (54) . The availability of a sensitive variant caller such as LoFreq thus opens up the potential for the use of this 'quasi species footprinting' approach (akin to phylogenetic footprinting) to reveal functionally important regions in other viral genomes as well.",

More complex models for sequencing errors can be constructed, that say account for correlations between adjacent bases, but would be technology specific and are likely to provide modest gains in sensitivity. The sensitivity/specificity tradeoff results here suggest that while model-based approaches (SNVer, Breseq) provide an improvement over ad hoc approaches, further significant gains in sensitivity are possible (without loss in specificity) using a quality-aware approach (LoFreq). Note that as LoFreq essentially distinguishes true variants from sequencing errors, it can also serve as a quality-aware 'error-correction' module for designing haplotype assemblers that can accommodate high-coverage sequencing datasets (54) . The inner bars mark mutational hotspots (red) and cold-spots (blue), which were derived from intra-host variations called by LoFreq (see 'Materials and Methods' section). Height of hotspots indicates how often the hotspot was found (sqrt(count)), whereas the height of cold-spots is fixed. The cold-spot in prM is shared between both serotypes. The last hotspot window in NS1 for the DENV2 samples was only found in pre-dose samples (Table 3 ) and disappears at later time points.",

The ability to call rare somatic variants, in particular, can be valuable in genomic studies of tumor heterogeneity and evolution as well as in emerging applications such as in tumor monitoring by sequencing of cell-free DNA (55) .
