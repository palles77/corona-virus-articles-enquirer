Lymphocytes collected 10 days postinfection were transferred to naive chicks before challenge with virus. As determined by respiratory illness and viral load, transfer of syngeneic immune T lymphocytes protected chicks from challenge infection, whereas no protection was observed in the chicks receiving the MHC compatible lymphocytes from uninfected chicks. Protection following administration of T lymphocytes could be observed in chicks with three distinct MHC haplotypes: B 8 /B 8 , B 12 /B 12 , and B 19 /B 19 . Nearly complete elimination of viral infection and illness was observed in chicks receiving cells enriched in \u2423\u2424 lymphocytes. In contrast, removal of \u2425\u2426 T lymphocytes had only a small effect on their potential to protect chicks. The adoptive transfer of enriched CD8 \u03e9 or CD4 \u03e9 T lymphocytes indicated that protection was also a function primarily of CD8-bearing cells. These results indicated that \u2423\u2424 T lymphocytes bearing CD8 \u03e9 antigens are critical in protecting chicks from IBV infection.",

The elimination of virus during acute infection was found to be closely correlated with CTL activity, and to a lesser extent with the presence of IgM antibody, but not with the presence of IgG antibody. The correlation of CTL with elimination of virus in vivo was further investigated through transfer of 4 \u03eb 10 6 immune (group 1) or nonimmune (group 2) lymphocytes to naive 5-day-old B 8 /B 8 chicks, 1 day prior to infection with IBV. A third group with age-matched birds received PBS in the absence of lymphocytes. After challenge with the Gray strain, the effects of lymphocyte transfer on associated respiratory illness were examined for 5 days. The transfer of immune cells delayed the onset of clinical illness, reduced the number of chicks infected, and reduced the clinical illness observed (Table  1) . On day 3, only two of six chicks displayed any signs of respiratory illness and they experienced only mild signs of occasional sneezing. In contrast, five of five chicks receiving normal lymphocytes or four of five inoculated with only buffer showed mild clinical signs of respiratory illness by day 2. On days 3, 4, and 5, all chicks inoculated with only buffer or with nonimmune lymphocytes were sneezing, in addition to experiencing more severe signs of tracheal and lung congestion as indicated by observed rales.",

Before the phenotypes of T lymphocytes responsible for in vivo decreases in viral replication were determined, it was necessary to increase the numbers by stimulating immune lymphocytes in the presence of IBV-infected and irradiated APC. Because the available cultured chicken kidney (CK) cells used as stimulators originated from B 12 /B 12 Hy-VAC chicks, effector immune T lymphocytes were prepared from B 12 /B 12 chicks. Following stimulation, cells were separated by depletion of CD8-, CD4-, TCR1 (\u2425\u2426)-, or TCR2 (\u2423\u2424)-bearing cells using mouse monoclonal antibody. The purity of the depleted cells was determined by flow cytometry. The purities of the CD8 \u03e9 enriched and CD4 \u03e9 enriched T lymphocytes were 96 and 95%, respectively.",

Transfer of these CTL directly into the central nervous system was at least 10-fold more effective than peripheral transfer. Histological analysis demonstrated that CTL reduced virus replication in ependymal cells, astrocytes, and microglia.

Ongoing studies making use of \u2423\u2424, CD8 \u03e9 T lymphocytes from chicks exposed to IBV are critical in determining factors that protect chickens against IBV infection. Future experiments will utilize available MHC recombinants. Because cells with the MHC restricted capacity to protect against challenge virus correlated with the CTL response, it may be suggested that the major mechanism for control of acute infection is due to CD8 \u03e9 , MHC restricted \u2423\u2424 T lymphocytes. Because IBV-specific CTL tend to recognize epitopes conserved among serologically distinct strains , mechanisms that induce CTL should be exploited with the development of effective vaccines.",
