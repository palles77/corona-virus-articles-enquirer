The goal of the study was to demonstrate the analytical performance of this platform when compared to identical individual pathogen specific laboratory developed tests (LDTs) designed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), equivalent LDTs provided by state public health laboratories, or to three different commercial multi-respiratory panels. CDC and Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) LDTs had similar analytical sensitivities for viral pathogens, while several of the bacterial pathogen APHL LDTs demonstrated sensitivities one log higher than the corresponding CDC LDT. When compared to CDC LDTs, TAC assays were generally one to two logs less sensitive depending on the site performing the analysis. Finally, TAC assays were generally more sensitive than their counterparts in three different commercial multi-respiratory panels. TAC technology allows users to spot customized assays and design TAC layout, simplify assay setup, conserve specimen, dramatically reduce contamination potential, and as demonstrated in this study, analyze multiple samples in parallel with good reproducibility between instruments and operators.",

Conventional techniques are frequently labor intensive, time consuming, less sensitive, and often require specialized expertise and/or facilities but remain valuable in cases where cultureindependent tests have reduced sensitivity. Examples include the http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2015.11.020 0166-0934/\u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Culture methods are also useful in clinical microbiology, such as for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Rapid reporting of real-time test results gives health professionals greater flexibility in patient management and provides epidemiologists time to recognize and respond to an outbreak. In addition, test results may allow for appropriate antimicrobial treatment that helps prevent the spread of secondary infection and development of multiple drug resistant species. Real-time PCR has demonstrated enhanced sensitivity, specificity, and utility when compared to traditional methods such as culture/DFA (Mahony, 2008) , including the ability to simultaneously detect multiple pathogens (Mengelle et al., 2014; Babady, 2013; Pillet et al., 2013; Choudhary et al., 2013; Weinberg et al., 2013; Kodani et al., 2011) , quantify pathogen load, and potentially identify new pathogens. While multiplex PCR is attractive in terms of throughput and conservation of reagents and specimen, it does require extensive optimization and is not easily amenable to changes in the components without an entire re-validation of the performance of the assays (Henegariu et al., 1997; Markoulatos et al., 2002) .",

            "text": "Several commercial platforms and assays exist for the simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory pathogens in a specimen, including the Luminex xTAG Respiratory Viral Panels (Luminex Corporation, Austin, Texas), Qiagen ResPlex v2.0 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and TessArae RPM 3.1 Flu (TessArae LLC, Potomac Falls, Virginia), along with other systems (Biofire Diagnostics, 2015; Hologic, 2015; GenMark diagnostics, 2015; PathoFinder, 2015; Fast-Track Diagnostics, 2015; Nanosphere, 2015) . These platforms differ in a variety of features including the type and number of analyses that can be performed (viral, bacterial, mixed, influenza specific), detection technology and need for dedicated instrumentation, complexity, sensitivity and throughput, and cost per specimen. Comparative evaluations of several of these panels show that they all have good specificity and varying levels of sensitivity across pathogens (Sakthivel et al., 2012; Renaud et al., 2012; Popowitch et al., 2013; Babady et al., 2012; Gadsby et al., 2010; Rand et al., 2011; Driscoll et al., 2014) . One common theme among all the commercial platforms is that the end user does not have control over the menu of assays included in the panel or the ability to customize individual assays without incurring significant developmental costs. At the time of preparation of this manuscript the Qiagen ResPlex v2.0 panel and TessArae were no longer available.",

The studies presented in this manuscript were carried out using a TAC partitioned into an 8 \u00d7 24 array where each sample was unique and assays were performed in duplicate as shown (Fig. 1 ). TACs and associated positive control materials (Kodani and Winchell, 2012) have been designed for the detection of respiratory pathogens (Kodani et al., 2011; Waller et al., 2014; Steensels et al., 2015) , hepatitis genomes , enteropathogens (Liu et al., , 2013 Platts-Mills et al., 2014) , and bioterrorism agents Rachwal et al., 2012) . Assays are independent of each other, so that modification of one primer/probe set will not require revalidation of the entire TAC. Thus, in the event that an assay is updated, new TACs would only have to be manufactured that incorporate the design change. The design of the TAC also helps to minimize specimen handling and requires less input template nucleic acid than an equivalent number of individual PCR reactions.",

During TAC manufacturing, target specific primer:probe solution is lyophilized in each well. Extracted nucleic acid (46 L) was combined with AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR Reagent (Ther-moFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, 54 L) and the reaction mixture was loaded into one of the sample ports. After all ports were loaded the reaction mixtures were distributed throughout the TAC by low speed centrifugation. This also rehydrates the lyophilized oligonucleotides. The assay for parainfluenza virus 1, PIV1 1, on the TAC was updated to PIV1 2 for better performance at the 60 \u2022 C annealing/extension temperature used in this study (see Table S3 ), therefore performance data are presented for the PIV1 2 assay only. Each TAC also included an assay for human coronavirus HKU1; however, the assay was not characterized due to the lack of an appropriate reference standard. In most cases each column represents a single assay spotted in duplicate wells as shown in Fig. 1 ; however the IPCO, GAPDH, and human coronavirus assays were spotted in single wells within a column (columns 11, 13, and 14). Duplicate testing reduces the probability of false negatives due to sampling variation near the LoD and can compensate for a single defect in the microfluidics channel on the TAC. Sample port one was reserved for use as a negative control, permitting seven samples to be analyzed on each TAC. Since the identity of each reference standard used in the studies was known a combined positive control was not included to verify individual assay performance.",

The overall goals were to evaluate the analytical performance of CDC developed reference assays on TACs in comparison with individual CDC laboratory developed tests (LDTs), LDTs from two different state PHLs, and three commercial multi-target respiratory panels. Sensitivity was generally one log lower in the TAC Table 4 Limit of detection for CDC viral and bacterial respiratory assays in TAC format. LoD is expressed as the highest dilution (lowest concentration) of extracted reference standard that met acceptance criteria for the experiment. format than for individual LDTs, consistent with previous studies (Kodani et al., 2011) . This may be due to the oligonucleotide concentrations not being fully optimized for TAC in addition to the smaller reaction volume (1-2 L per assay) as compared to typical real-time assays (20-30 L). Smaller reaction volumes conserve specimen in comparison with individual or multiplexed real-time PCR assays, leaving greater residual specimen volume to be used for further molecular or microbial characterization. Additionally, the CDC viral LDTs were optimized for an annealing temperature of 55 \u2022 C, while the bacterial LDTs were designed to use 60 \u2022 C. The bacterial LDTs did not perform as well at 55 \u2022 C (data not shown), while the viral LDTs were acceptable at the higher annealing temperature. Since both types of assays were included on the TACs, a compromise was made by running all of the assays at an annealing temperature of 60 \u2022 C. Previous studies have compared the sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of TACs for the detection of viral and bacterial pathogens capable of causing respiratory infections against individual real-time PCR assays in a 96 well format (wet assays) using clinical specimens. In one study examining 192 virus positive specimens the sensitivity and specificity of TAC was 95% and 98%, respectively (Kodani et al., 2011) ; whereas in a different study testing 942 specimens these values were 83% and 99% (Weinberg et al., 2013) . Detection sensitivity as described in these previous studies varied depending on the target, with the adenovirus, human parainfluenza virus 2, M. pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae assays demonstrating lower performance. Reproducibility of cycle threshold (Ct) values within and across TACs in these two studies was also good, with an average coefficient of variation below 2.91%. Finally, positive and negative predictive performance in both studies was also similar between TAC and traditional individual wet assays. A separate follow up TAC study found that sensitivity near the LoD could be further improved by optimizing the entire testing procedure, including evaluating different enzyme systems, adjusting oligonucleotide concentrations, and by increasing the number of replicates from two to four (Diaz et al., 2013) .",

Regardless of the specimen type assayed, TAC demonstrated sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility equivalent to other multi-pathogen detection platforms. One limitation of the current study is that the LoD was not calculated in terms of infectious dose 50% (ID 50 ) or copies/mL. Future studies will evaluate TAC performance against validated laboratory developed tests using clinical specimens of known titer. Several different extraction instruments, combinations of oligonucleotide primers and probes, PCR enzyme master mixes, and real-time instruments were used by multiple laboratories in this study and the consistency of the results demonstrated the robustness of the technique when assays are carefully designed and thoroughly validated. Taken collectively, the data underscore the utility of TAC for multi-pathogen testing performed on a variety of specimen types using various extraction and amplification chemistries. Although inherent logistical limitations exist when attempting to compare technologies, the results of the current study demonstrate that the TAC is an ideal platform for testing specimens using a customized panel of targets and supports the suitability of TAC for future studies in a variety of formats and settings.",

At maximum density the cards are arranged in an 8 specimen \u00d7 48 assay array for a maximum total of 384 individual real-time PCR reactions. TACs can also be manufactured in other formats. In this study the cards were partitioned into 8 specimen \u00d7 24 assay sub-arrays where each assay was performed in duplicate in adjacent wells (squares A and B). Each column represents a single assay (abbreviation shown in parenthesis), with the exception of the internal positive control (IPCO), manufacturing control (GAPDH), and human coronavirus assays which were spotted in single wells within a column (columns 11, 13, and 14). Each card also includes an RNA control (RNP3). Sample port one was reserved for use as a negative control, permitting seven samples to be analyzed on each TAC.",
