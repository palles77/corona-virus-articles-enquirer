While lacking the rapid human-tohuman spread seen with its SARS-CoV cousin, the outbreak of MERS-CoV has continued in the Middle East over the past three years and has lead to infection in 26 countries, N 1500 cases, and N550 deaths (WHO, 2015) . With periodic reintroduction from zoonotic sources and the possibility for further human adaptation, MERS-CoV remains a significant global public health threat and highlights the need for therapeutic countermeasures to limit infection and spread.",

However, a number of reports have provided both insights and tools for further study including extensive sequencing data, reverse genetic resources, and monoclonal antibodies for treatment of infection (Zumla et al., 2015) . In contrast, vaccine strategies have been limited due to the absence of robust animal models. Typically examined in mice, the presence of specific charge and glycosylation difference between human and rodent DPP4, the receptor for MERS-CoV, prevent infection (Peck et al., 2015) . Therefore, the traditional approaches to study pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy have been stunted. The lack of a small animal model has shifted MERS-CoV research into larger in vivo models including non-human primates and ungulates (van Doremalen and Munster, 2015) . Koch's postulates EBioMedicine 2 (2015) 1292-1293 were first achieved for MERS-CoV in rhesus macaques (Falzarano et al., 2014) . Subsequently, other large animal models have been reported including marmosets, camels, rabbits, and alpacas and vary in their levels of MERS-CoV pathogenesis (van Doremalen and Munster, 2015) . While new small animal models have been described and continue to be developed, in the short term, non-human primates provide the best model for testing vaccines and therapeutics.",

Building on previous studies in rhesus macaques with SARS-CoV (Wang et al., 2012) , the report details the efficacy of a MERS vaccine based on a recombinant receptor binding domain (RBD) subunit. Their results indicate stimulation of both humoral and cellular immunity following vaccination and boost. Subsequent intra-tracheal challenge of vaccinated monkeys revealed partial protection from MERS-CoV induced pathogenesis including reduced pneumonia and viral titers. Having been tested for both SARS and MERS-CoV, the platform has potential as a rapid response vaccine approach for future emergent CoV outbreaks. Similarly, the platform could also be deployed in reservoir populations like camels that are thought to harbor the virus (Zumla et al., 2015) . However, this RBD-based vaccine failed to produce sterilizing immunity typically sought in the context of vaccination. Overall, the results demonstrate that in the rhesus macaque model, subunit vaccines that target the receptor-binding domain of MERS-CoV can offer some level of protection, but require further refinement to induce sterilizing immunity.",

The rhesus macaque model, which supports MERS-CoV replication, fails to recapitulate severe disease seen in humans. As such, the level of protection in these studies may underestimate the utility of the approach or, alternatively, provides only minor protection for human disease. Further study in more pathogenic models like the marmoset or with adapted viruses is required to decipher this question. Similarly, while the RBD-based platform drives protection, other aspects of vaccine efficacy cannot be tested in the macaque model. Previous work with a double inactivated SARS-CoV had shown efficacy in young mice (Spruth et al., 2006) ; however, subsequent analysis in aged animals or with heterologous challenge revealed vaccine failure and significant immune pathology (Bolles et al., 2011) . While not tested in experimental systems, based on reported cases, age and immuno-compromised status appears to be co-morbidity factors for MERS-CoV infection and lethality (Hilgenfeld and Peiris, 2013; Zumla et al., 2015) . Therefore, testing the efficacy of any vaccine in aged and immune compromised populations ",
