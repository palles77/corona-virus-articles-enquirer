Myers et al. found that a delayed recovery of ADV-specific T cells in recipients of unrelated or haploidentical grafts correlated with an increased risk for ADV disease. The observation that the outcome of ADV disease is related to specific immune reconstitution suggests that the recovery of ADV-specific immunity is a critical process that can be improved by decreasing the intensity of immunosuppression. In addition, the transfer of virus-specific T cells has been shown to be effective in controlling cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infections in HSCT recipients. Although the different ADV subtypes are to some extent antigenically distinct, these same subtypes share T cell epitopes on the hexon protein. Furthermore, crossreactivity has been shown ex vivo. Early in vitro experiments showed that ADV-specific T cells can be generated by ADV pulsed dendritic cells, and that these can lyse adenoinfected cells. Chatziandreou et al. [15] and Feuchtinger et al. [16] isolated ADV-specific T cells through an interferon (INF)-g-secretion and capture assay and could show specific antigen responses of both CD4 1 and CD8 1 T cells upon restimulation with different ADV strains. Another promising approach is the adoptive immunotherapy with allodepleted donor T cells to improve immune reconstitution concerning all common viruses.",

The recent outbreak of new pandemic strain A/H1N1 stressed the importance of having strategies in place for management of these patients. Influenza infection is controlled by different parts of the immune system including both the innate and adaptive immune systems. After vaccination, both T cell and B cell responses are activated. Clearance of the primary infection depends on CD8 cells. These cells recognize epitopes from both the hemagglutinin (HA) and internal proteins of the influenza virus. Following recovery from influenza, antigen-specific T cells maintain long-lasting immunologic memory that responds quickly to restimulation. The B cells produce antibodies to the influenza proteins and HA-specific antibodies appear within 2 weeks of the infection. In contrast to antibodies directed to HA, antibodies directed to NA do not neutralize virus but reduces the release of virus from infected cells. A problem specific for influenza viruses is the antigenic shifts and drifts of circulating influenza virus that regularly occur, requiring adaptation of the seasonal tri-valent influenza vaccines that must be administered to provide protection.",

The second vaccine dose had only a marginal effect. Pauksen et al. [23] found response rates in allogeneic SCT patients vaccinated 4 to 12 months after HCT of 11/35 (31%) for H1N1, 3/35 (9%) for H3N2, and 7/35 (20%) for influenza B. However, despite suboptimal serologic responses, clinical effectiveness of vaccination could potentially exist. Machado et al. [24] found that influenza vaccination performed at least 6 months after SCT had an efficacy in preventing influenza of 80%. It is possible that protection is mediated also by T cells. Avetisyan et al. [25] analyzed the T cell response in adult patients and found a significant increase in the number of IFN-g producing T cells both in patients vaccinated between 3 and 6 months after HCT and in those vaccinated later, although the response in the late group was stronger. Furthermore, it has been shown in the elderly that the risk for influenza disease is comparable in individuals demonstrating a cell-mediated response alone, an antibody response alone, or both types of responses [26] .",

Immunization can be considered in allogeneic HSCT patients without chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) or ongoing immunosuppression.
