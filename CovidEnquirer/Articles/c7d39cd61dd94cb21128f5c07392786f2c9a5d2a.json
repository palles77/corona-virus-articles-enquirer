Diagnostic tools for serological surveys of PDCoV remain in the developmental stage when compared with those for other porcine coronaviruses. In our study, an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (rPDCoV-N-ELISA) was developed to detect antibodies against PDCoV using a histidine-tagged recombinant nucleocapsid (N) protein as an antigen. The rPDCoV-N-ELISA did not cross-react with antisera against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine group A rotavirus, classical swine fever virus, porcine circovirus-2, porcine pseudorabies virus, and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus; the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed 100% sensitivity and 90.4% specificity of the rPDCoV-N-ELISA based on samples of known status (n=62). Analyses of field samples (n=319) using the rPDCoV-N-ELISA indicated that 11.59% of samples were positive for antibodies against PDCoV. These data demonstrated that the rPDCoV-N-ELISA can be used for epidemiological investigations of PDCoV and that PDCoV had a low serum prevalence in pig population in Heilongjiang province, northeast China.",

Since first reported in swine in the U.S.A. in February 2014, PDCoV rapidly spread to other states in the U.S.A., as well as to Canada, and it caused significant economic losses in the swine industry [14, 16, [19] [20] [21] . Recently, PDCoV has been reported in the pig population from China and South Korea [5, 12] . Hu et al. reported the cell culture isolation, serial propagation, and biologic and genetic characterizations of cell-adapted PDCoV strains [9] . Jung et al. reported that two PDCoV strains, OH-FD22 and OH-FD100, are enteropathogenic in gnotobiotic pigs [10] . Chen et al. revealed the pathogenicity of a plaque-purified PDCoV cell culture isolate and characterized PDCoV pathogenesis in neonatal piglets [3] . The accumulating reports demonstrated that PDCoV is associated with diarrhea in pigs.",

The genome of PDCoV is approximately twenty-five kilobases in length, which is similar to those of other porcine coronaviruses, and it encodes four similar major structural proteins: the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [13, 15] . Reports derived from other coronaviruses indicated that the N protein is highly conserved among different strains, and it is widely used as a diagnostic antigen for the development of serologic diagnostic tools [1, 8, 11, 17] . In the current study, a recombinant N protein-based indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (rPDCoV-N-ELISA) was established to detect antibodies against porcine deltacoronavirus. Furthermore, the serum prevalence of PDCoV was investigated and analyzed using the rPDCoV-N-ELISA in Heilongjiang province, northeast China. Our aim was to provide a potential serological diagnostic tool for PDCoV.",

The PDCoV N protein shared 22.2%, 28.2% and 18.4% amino acid identities with PEDV (strain CV777, accession no. DQ355221), TGEV (strain H, accession no. EU074218) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) N proteins (strain ISU-1, accession no. DQ811787), respectively. Therefore, a cross-reaction between the N protein of the PDCoV and the N proteins from TGEV, PEDV and PRCV is unlikely. As expected, the PDCoV N protein did not cross-react with TGEV, PEDV, PRCV, PRoV, CSFV, PCV-2, PRV and PRRSV in the specificity assay. Our results are in line with those of an indirect anti-PDCoV IgG ELISA based on the putative S1 portion of the S protein, as described by Thachil et al. [17] . In addition, the N protein exhibited a high degree of conservation, 98.8-100% identities, among different PDCoV strains. Ant\u00f3n et al. reported that high levels of TGEV-specific antibodies could be induced by a combination of S-rosettes and the N protein [2] . These properties made the N protein suitable as a diagnostic antigen of PDCoV in an indirect ELISA, which was supported by other coronavirus studies [1, 7, 10, 16] .",

However, positive serum against PDCoV is a key factor needed for the establishment of a rPDCoV-N-ELISA. In our study, to screen for PDCoV-positive serum, the PDCoV N gene was expressed using two prokaryotic expression vectors with different fusion tags: pGEX-6P-1 with a GST-tag and pET-32a with a His-tag. The PDCoV-positive sera from farms were validated when the samples showed a specific reaction with purified His-tagged and GST-tagged rPDCoV-N proteins, thereby eliminating all false-positive serum samples. Additionally, the PDCoV-negative serum samples were also strictly identified using a combination of the RT-PCR and western blotting using GST-tagged rPDCoV-N as an antigen. Moreover, the PR cut-off value of the rPDCoV-N-ELISA was determined by using PDCoVnegative serum samples. In our study, the introduction of the PR value to the rPDCoV-N-ELISA reduced errors that resulted from different operation conditions, as was reported in a similar study [6] . Generally, a novel ELISA diagnostic method requires validation via a comparison with the same, or a similar, commercial ELISA kit. Although an indirect anti-PDCoV IgG ELISA based on the putative S1 portion of the spike protein has recently been reported by Thachil et al. [17] , no ELISA kit was available for evaluation of the rPDCoV-N-ELISA that was established in our study. To evaluate the rPDCoV-N-ELISA, comparison with the western blotting using GSTtagged rPDCoV-N as an antigen was carried by analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Compared with the western blotting, the rPDCoV-N-ELISA exhibited a relative specificity of 90.4% and a relative sensitivity of 100%. Accumulating reports indicate that the S protein has a high degree of variability in the members of coronaviruses [4, 18] . Therefore, compared with S protein-based ELISAs, the rPDCoV-N-ELISA still has potential application value as a diagnostic antigen, because of the highly conserved nature. The rPDCoV-N-ELISA results of field samples indicated that 11.59% of samples were positive for antibodies against PDCoV. In our study, positive rate of the PDCoV antibodies in samples is similar to that reported by Thachil et al. [17] . It is suggested that an extensive serological investigation of the epidemiology of PDCoV in China should be performed in a future study.",
