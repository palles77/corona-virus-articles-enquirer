Porcine parvovirus (PPV) is the causative agent of reproductive failure in swine. Here, we observed that the PPV infection of porcine kidney 15 and porcine testis cells resulted in the activation of ER stress sensors mediated by protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK), but not inositol-requiring enzyme 1 and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). ER stress activation obviously blocked PPV replication. Depletion of proteins, such as PERK, eukaryotic initiation factor 2, and ATF4, by small interfering RNA significantly enhanced PPV replication. Moreover, the pro-apoptotic factor C/EBP homologous protein was identified a key factor in the inhibition of PPV replication. These data demonstrate that PPV infection activates ER stress through the PERK signaling pathway and that ER stress inhibits further PPV replication by promoting apoptosis.",

            "text": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a membrane-bound compartment mainly responsible for protein processing and transport, lipid metabolism, and calcium homeostasis (Hetz, 2012; Kim et al., 2008; Ron and Walter, 2007) . Although the ER has a very strong homeostasis system, it can be destroyed by external factors, such as pathogen invasion, chemical insult, energy or nutrient deprivation, destruction of calcium homeostasis, oxidative stress, and accumulation of unfolded, misfolded, or excessive proteins (Dimcheff et al., 2004; Iwata and Koizumi, 2012; Kim et al., 2008; Ye et al., 2011; Zhang and Wang, 2012) . The disturbance of ER homeostasis induces a stress response, known as ER stress. In response to ER stress, cells trigger a unique intracellular signaling pathway, termed the unfolded protein response (UPR), which reestablishes homeostasis in the ER or triggers apoptosis if ER stress is severe or prolonged. The UPR is mediated by three distinct signaling pathways: protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and inositol-requiring protein-1 (IRE1) (Pahl, 1999; Ron and Walter, 2007; Shen et al., 2002) . Under normal physiological conditions, these three proximal UPR sensors associate with glucose-regulated protein 78 KD (GRP78), also known as immunoglobulin binding protein (Ni et al., 2011; Quinones et al., 2008) . GRP78 locates in the ER as a chaperone and belongs to the heat shock protein 70 family. During ER stress, GRP78 binds to misfolded proteins and releases PERK, ATF6, and IRE1. Activated PERK phosphorylates the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIf2\u03b1), which, in turn, activates the downstream signaling of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), leading to attenuated global translation initiation and protein synthesis (Shi et al., 1998) . ATF4 stimulates the expression of the pro-apoptotic factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), growth arrest, and the activation of DNA damage-inducible protein 34 and other genes that trigger oxidative stress and programmed cell death (Novoa et al., 2003; Zinszner et al., 1998) . CHOP is a nuclear transcription factor downstream of ATF4 that can induce apoptosis in response to ER stress; however, overexpression will lead to down-regulated expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2. released from GRP78, ATF6 translocates from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. Activated ATF6 is cleaved by proteases, generating the transcriptionally active form of ATF6 (ATF6p50) (Li et al., 2000) . Activated IRE1 splices the full-length X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA and removes 26 base pairs, resulting in the frameshift conversion of the premature unspliced XBP1 protein (XBP1U) to the spliced XBP1 protein (XBP1S) (Lee et al., 2003) . ATF4, ATF6p50, and XBP1S migrate to the nucleus, where they promote the expression of a distinct set of UPR target genes, including those encoding molecular chaperones and proteins contributing to ER-associated degradation.",

            "text": "During viral infection, a large number of viral proteins are synthesized in the ER, which destroys the cellular translation machinery, resulting in the induction of ER stress and subsequent facilitation of viral infection (Zhang and Wang, 2012) . It was reported that the SAT protein (SATp) of the attenuated PPV strains NADL-2 and Kresse accumulates in the ER and that the SAT deletion mutant of both of these strains induces a slow-spreading phenotype (Meszaros et al., 2017; Zadori et al., 2005) . ER stress activation promoted viral egress of porcine testis (PT) fibroblasts infected with the Kresse strain of PPV at a high multiplicity of infection (MOI) (Meszaros et al., 2017) . The early stage of infection with the attenuated PPV NADL-2 strain was almost completely abolished by the ER inducer MG132 (Boisvert et al., 2010) . A similar inhibitory effect of MG132 treatment of infection with PPV strain Kresse was detected at a low MOI (Meszaros et al., 2017) . These data suggested that ER stress has both negative and positive effects on PPV replication related to the strain and dose of the virus. However, the potential mechanism of how ER stress modulates PPV replication remains largely unclear. Several reports have suggested an interaction between viral replication and the UPR pathway (Zhang and Wang, 2012) . In 2015, we isolated a PPV strain from the liver of an aborted fetus in Tianjin, China, named strain TJ (Cao et al., 2017) . In the present study, we characterized the ER stress response in porcine kidney 15 (PK-15) and PT cells infected with PPV strain TJ. We observed that PPV strain TJ infection leads to an active ER stress pathway mediated by PERK/eIF2\u03b1, but not XBP1 and ATF6. ER stress-inducing drugs can inhibit PPV strain TJ infection. Depletion of the proteins PERK, eIF2\u03b1, and ATF4 enhanced viral titers, demonstrating that ER stress and the UPR play essential roles against PPV strain TJ infection.",

A one-step growth curve of PPV in PK-15 and PT cells showed that the viral titer reached a maximal constant value at 60 hpi, and then gradually decreased (Fig. 1A ). GRP78 is a sensitive marker of ER stress. We first assessed the mRNA and protein expression levels of GRP78 following PPV infection in PK-15 and PT cells. As shown in Fig. 1B and C, when compared with the mock-infected control group, PPV strain TJ induced GRP78 gene transcription at 12, 24, and 36 hpi in PK-15 cells, and at 24, 36, and 48 hpi in PT cells. The mRNA levels of GRP78 peaked in PPV-infected PK-15 and PT cells at 24 and 48 hpi. Similarly, the protein levels of GRP78 were increased in virus-infected PK-15 cells at 12, 24, and 36 hpi, and at 36 and 48 hpi in PT cells ( Fig. 1D and E) .

Increased p-PERK and p-eIF2\u03b1 concentrations were apparent at 12, 24, and 36 hpi in PK-15 cells and at 24, 36, and 48 hpi in PT cells. However, the changes in p50ATF6 protein expression could not be detected in PK-15 and PT cells ( Fig. 2A and B ). As expected, the mRNA levels of ATF4, and CHOP were significantly elevated during PERK-eIF2\u03b1 activation by PPV ( Fig. 2C and D) . Elevated ATF4 and CHOP mRNA levels peaked at 24 hpi in PK-15 cells and at 48 hpi in PT cells.

The ER stress inducer Tg was used as a positive control. Total XBP1 cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR and digested with PstI. As shown in Fig. 2E and F, the spliced form of the XBP1 product (XBP1S) was increased, while the expression of unspliced XBP1 (XBP1U) was decreased in the control cells treated with Tg, whereas no increase of XBP1S was observed in cells infected with PPV or the mock infection groups.

Tu is an antibiotic that induces ER stress by blocking the formation of N-glycosidic linkages in newly synthesized polypeptides (Oyadomari and Mori, 2004) . The cytotoxic effects of Tg and Tu were examined using the CCK-8 assay. Incubation of PK-15 and PT cells with 1 \u03bcM Tg or 2 \u03bcg/mL Tu for 24 h resulted in no significant toxicity (Fig. 3A) . Treatment of PK-15 and PT cells with Tg and Tu significantly enhanced the expression of GRP78, as compared with DMSO, suggesting that Tg and Tu could activate ER stress in PK-15 and PT cells ( Fig. 3B and C) . To evaluate the effects of Tg and Tu on viral infection, IFA was used. As shown in Fig. 3D , treatments with Tg and Tu obviously decreased the sizes of the fluorescent foci both in PPV-infected PK-15 and PT cells, and the inhibitory effect of Tg was more obvious than that of Tu. This result clearly indicates that activation of ER stress with ER stress-specific inducers inhibited the production of PPV strain TJ progeny.",

However, a study of vesicular stomatitis virus demonstrated that ER stress activation inhibited viral infection (Baltzis et al., 2004) . Previous studies have shown that treatment with the ER stress inducer MG132 inhibited infection by PPV strain NADL-2, similar to the results observed with PPV strain Kresse infection at a low MOI (Boisvert et al., 2010; Meszaros et al., 2017) . Meszaros et al. also showed that the specific ER stress inducer Tg inhibited infection by PPV strain Kresse. However, ER stress-inducing chemicals (MG132 and dithiothreitol) accelerated the release and spread of PPV strain Kresse at a high MOI (Meszaros et al., 2017) . In our study, inducing the ER stress pathway by ER stress-inducing chemicals (Tg and Tu), interfered with PPV strain TJ infection of PK-15 and PT cells at MOIs of 0.01, 0.1, and 1, suggesting that activation of the ER stress pathway is essential to prevent viral infection. During PPV infection of cells at a high MOI (e.g., MOI of 3), Tg had an inhibitory effect on viral infection in both PK-15 and PT cells. However, the inhibitory effect of Tu on viral infection occurred in PK-15 cells, but not PT cells. Tu treatment of PPV strain TJ infection at a high MOI in PT cells had similar effect or even enhanced viral infection, as compared with DMSO-treated control cells (data not shown). This observation suggests that the mechanisms by which ER stress regulates PPV replication are related to the virus strain, the dose of the virus, and the infected cells.",

            "text": "Downstream signaling of the UPR involves three distinct pathways (PERK, IRE1, and ATF6), which are activated in response to ER stress (Ron and Walter, 2007) . Viruses regulate ER stress activation via different mechanisms. Activation of ER stress is usually mediated by all three signaling pathways or one or two pathways during virus infection. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus, Borna disease virus, and dengue virus activate ER stress by targeting three branches of the UPR (Lee et al., 2018; Williams and Lipkin, 2006; Xue et al., 2018) . Newcastle disease virus induces activation of ER stress via the PERK and ATF6 pathways, but not XBP1 (Cheng et al., 2016) . ER stress activation by Herpes simplex virus 1, bovine viral diarrhea virus, and porcine circovirus 2 are mediated mainly by the PERK signaling pathway (Cheng et al., 2005; Jordan et al., 2002; Zhou et al., 2016) . IRE1-alpha (IRE1\u03b1) and XBP1 play important roles in the activation of the hepatitis B virus S promoter by ER stress (Huang et al., 2005) . Moreover, IRE1\u03b1 is The silencing efficiency of PERK, eIF2\u03b1, and ATF4 by shRNA or siRNA were analyzed by western blot analysis. Detergent lysate from PK-15 cells transfected with PERK-specific shRNA, eIF2\u03b1, ATF4-specific siRNA or NC for 24 h were subjected to immunoblotting with Abs against PERK, eIF2\u03b1, ATF4, or \u03b2-actin (loading control). (B, E, and H) PPV VP2 protein was increased in PERK, eIF2\u03b1, and ATF4-knockdown cells. PK-15 cells were transfected with shPERk-#4, sieIF2\u03b1-#2, siATF4-#2, or NC for 24 h and then infected with PPV at an MOI of 0.1. At 24 hpi, the expression of PPV VP2 was detected by western blot analysis. Relative levels of VP2 were estimated by densitometric scanning after normalization against \u03b2-actin. *p < 0.05 vs. the NC group. (C, F, and I) PPV titers on PK-15 cells transfected with shPERK-#4, sieIF2\u03b1-#2, siATF4-#2, or NC were calculated and expressed as TCID 50 /mL.

Recent evidence indicates that PPV strain Kresse infection could activate XBP1 or CHOP expression (Meszaros et al., 2017) . Our study demonstrated that PPV infection enhanced the mRNA levels of the UPR marker molecules ATF4 and CHOP, but not that of spliced XBP1 (Fig. 2) . Therefore, it is possible that the activation of XBP1 has a different mechanism for the regulation of different PPV strains. Western blot analysis showed that PPV infection increased the phosphorylation levels of PERK and its downstream molecule eIF2\u03b1 (Fig. 2) . However, the ATF6 protein was not cleaved during PPV infection. This result indicates that the PERK signaling pathway is involved in ER stress activation in PK-15 and PT cells infected with PPV. By identifying the signaling events of the UPR pathway in the regulation of PPV replication, we found that PERK, eIF2\u03b1, and ATF4 promoted PPV replication using siRNAs. It has been shown that PPV primarily interacts with the PERK signaling molecules eIF2\u03b1 and ATF4 to suppress viral replication.",

Previous studies have shown that PPV infection induces both ER stress and apoptosis (Barber et al., 2017; Boisvert et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2014; Meszaros et al., 2017) . However, there is no evidence of the relationship among PPV-induced ER stress, apoptosis, and viral replication. In our case, PPV strain TJ induced apoptosis of PK-15 cells at a rate of 14.26% at 24 hpi (Fig. 6B) . Also, apoptotic cell death was promoted by the apoptosis inducer (nutlin-3), which inhibited PPV strain TJ infection of PK-15 cells, suggesting that apoptosis negatively regulates PPV infection ( Fig. 6C and D) . CHOP is a deathrelated transcription factor that can promote cell apoptosis upon ER stress activation (Marciniak et al., 2004; Zinszner et al., 1998) . It was clear that PPV strain TJ infection could increase the expression of CHOP ( Fig. 2C and D) . Overexpression of porcine CHOP clearly inhibited PPV replication and the titer was decreased by more than 32-fold (Fig. 5B) . Moreover, transfection of PK-15 cells with shRNA targeting the CHOP gene promoted viral replication and increased the titer by 6.3-fold (Fig. 5E ). Taken together, these data suggest that PPV infection can lead to the induction of CHOP and that CHOP has an essential role in the cellular antiviral response. It is likely that the expression of CHOP is increased in infected cells, which leads to accelerated apoptosis of infected cells and inhibits viral replication and viral progeny production. In addition, PPV strain TJ infection induced ER stress-accelerated apoptotic cell death, which contributes to the inhibition of PPV replication ( Fig. 6E and F) . Therefore, we identified a mechanism whereby PPV strain TJ-induced ER stress blocked viral replication by accelerating apoptotic cell death.",

Our studies provide the first evidence that the PPV strain TJ activates ER stress via the PERK/eIF2\u03b1/ATF4/CHOP signaling pathway in PK-15 and PT cells, and that ER stress activation inhibits PPV replication in vitro by promoting apoptotic cell death. Depletion of the endogenous signaling events of the PERK signaling pathway, including PERK, eIF2\u03b1, ATF4, and CHOP significantly increase viral replication. These data lay the foundation for future studies to better understand the biological characteristics in relation to PPV infection and develop new antiviral drugs against PPV.",

(A) Cell viability was detected using the CCK-8 assay after treatment with 10 or 20 \u03bcM nutlin-3 for 24 h. (B) The apoptotic rate of mock-infected and PPV-infected cells induced by nutlin-3. Cells infected with 0.1 MOI of PPV and treated with 10 and 20 \u03bcM nutlin-3 were harvested, stained with Annexin V-FITC and PI at 24 hpi, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Annexin V-and PI-positive cells were regarded as apoptotic. (C) Levels of PPV VP1 or VP2 and \u03b2-actin proteins as determined by western blot analysis. Cells infected with 0.1 MOI of PPV and treated with 10 and 20 \u03bcM nutlin-3. At 24 hpi, cells lysates were subjected to western blot analysis. Mock-infected and PPV-infected DMSO-treated cells served as the negative and positive controls, respectively. The band intensities of PPV VP2 determined by densitometry and normalized to the intensities of the corresponding \u03b2-actin bands. (D) Viral titers were determined with the TCID 50 assay. Representative data from three independent experiments are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD. *p < 0.05 vs. the DMSO control. (E) PK-15 cells were treated with Tg and infected with PPV at an MOI of 0.1. The lysates of PK-15 cells were subjected to western blot analysis using specific Abs against GRP78, Bcl2, PPV VP2, and \u03b2-actin. Relative levels of VP2 were estimated by densitometric scanning after normalization against \u03b2-actin. *P < 0.05 vs. the NC group. (F) Apoptosis rate of PPV-infected PK-15 cells treated with Tg. Cells infected with 0.1 MOI of PPV and treated with DMSO or 1 \u03bcM Tg. Cells were harvested and stained with Annexin V-FITC and PI at 24 hpi and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells positively stained with annexin V and PI were regarded as apoptotic. Fig. 7 . A schematic model of the viral inhibition by the PERK-eIF2\u03b1-ATF4-CHOP pathway during PPV infection. PPV strain TJ infection induces ER stress and apoptosis. ER stress induction was associated with PPV infection and mainly mediated by the PERK-eIF2\u03b1-ATF4-CHOP pathway, but not the IRE1 and ATF6 pathways. PPV-induced ER stress accelerates apoptotic cell death and suppresses PPV replication.",
