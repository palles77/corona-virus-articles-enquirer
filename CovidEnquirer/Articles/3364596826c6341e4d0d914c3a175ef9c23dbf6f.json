Here, we further analyzed characteristics of these newly identified HIV-1 restriction factors. Firstly, in contrast to other anti-HIV-1 proteins, such as tetherin and APOBEC3G, IFITMs were resistant to a down-regulation of surface expression or degradation by HIV-1 proteins. Secondly, the enforced expression of IFITMs reduced the production of HIV-1 viruses from cells transfected with proviral plasmids containing whole viral sequences. Although their inhibitory activities were modest when compared to that of tetherin, IFITMs, but not tetherin, directly reduced the expression of HIV-1 proteins including Gag, Vif and Nef. Of importance, however, IFITMs had no inhibitory effect when these viral proteins were expressed by codon-optimized cDNAs that bypassed the viral-specific expression machinery. Indeed, our results supported the idea that IFITMs interfere with viral protein expression mediated by double-stranded viral RNAs, such as RRE and TAR. Finally, the S-palmitoylation of IFITMs, which is crucial for their anti-influenza virus activity, was not required for their anti-HIV-1 activity, indicating that IFITMs restrict these viruses at different steps. These characteristics lead to a better understanding of the mechanism by which IFITMs restrict HIV-1 and other viruses.",

Viral recognition induces the activation of cellular signaling pathways that trigger the production of IFN, which leads to the expression of a set of IFN-stimulated genes that inhibit viral replication through diverse mechanisms [1, 2] . The IFN-induced transmembrane (IFITM) genes were identified as IFN-stimulated genes [3] . Among this family of proteins, IFITM1, 2, and 3 are ubiquitously expressed. Although it has been reported that IFITM1 and IFITM3 play distinct roles in mouse primordial germ cell homing and repulsion [4] , their precise physiological functions remain largely unknown. Intriguingly, recent studies have revealed that IFITM family proteins are potent inhibitors of influenza virus, West Nile virus, dengue virus [5e8], Marburg and Ebola filoviruses, SARS coronavirus [9] , vesicular stomatitis virus [10] , HCV [11] , and HIV-1 [12, 13] . However, it remains unclear how these small proteins, which are composed of approximately 130 amino acids, exert antiviral activity against a broad range of viruses.",

            "text": "Recently, Lu et al. showed that the knockdown of all three ifitm genes increased the susceptibility of TZM-bl HeLa cells to HIV-1 infection [12] . Consistent with this result, the enforced expression of IFITM1, 2, or 3 markedly suppressed HIV-1 replication in SupT1 T cells without affecting cell proliferation, the cell cycle, or the cell surface expression of the HIV-1 entry receptor CD4 [12] . Schoggins et al. also reported that the enforced expression of IFITM2 or 3 had a similar inhibitory effect on HIV-1 replication using another T cell line, MT-4 [13] . Although HIV-1 entry step was clearly inhibited by IFITM2 and 3, the entry step might not be the primary target of IFITM1 during its restriction of HIV-1 replication, since IFITM1 did not affect HIV-1 entry but efficiently suppressed HIV-1 replication in SupT1 cells [12] . Indeed, it was shown that the intracellular region, rather than the N-or C-terminal extracellular domains, of IFITM1 is required for its inhibitory effect on HIV-1 [12] . Importantly, Lu et al. also showed that the enforced expression of IFITMs led to a reduction in the expression of the structural HIV-1 protein Gag, which might be simply due to the reduced viral replication. Nevertheless, it is also possible that IFITMs directly affect Gag expression.",

            "text": "In addition to the mechanism by which they suppress Gag expression, there are several unanswered questions regarding IFITMs. HIV-1 encodes proteins that antagonize the activities of IFN-inducible antiviral proteins. For instance, tetherin (also known as BST-2 or CD317) blocks the release of nascent virions from infected cells, but the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu acts as a viral antagonist by inducing the down-regulation of tetherin expression at the cell surface [14e19]. Similarly, the cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G, whose expression is elevated by IFN [20] , causes the hyper-mutation of HIV-1 cDNA, but another HIV-1 accessory protein, Vif, antagonizes its anti-HIV-1 activity by inducing the degradation of APOBEC3G [21e27]. However, it has not been examined whether HIV-1 antagonizes the anti-HIV-1 activity of IFITMs. Curiously, in contrast to the findings of two independent studies [12, 13] , Neil et al. failed to observe an inhibitory effect of the enforced expression of IFITMs on HIV-1 production in a study in which they identified tetherin as an HIV-1 restriction factor [15] . In this study, we therefore attempted to investigate whether HIV-1 proteins affect the expression and localization of IFITMs, how anti-HIV-1 activity of IFITMs and tetherin are different, and how IFITMs affect the expression of HIV-1 proteins in order to further understand the characteristics of these newly identified HIV-1 restriction factors.",

We therefore prepared three different mutants of Flag-tagged IFITM3, in which these cysteines had been mutated (singly or in combination) to alanine (C1/2A, C3A, and C1/2/3A; see Fig. 6A for details). As these cysteines are conserved in IFITM2 (C70, C71, and C104), similar mutants of IFITM2 were also prepared. The mutants were prepared using the QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) and appropriate mutagenic primers and cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector. The nucleotide sequences of the mutants were verified using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit and an ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).

However, in a study in which the enforced expression of tetherin was found to strongly inhibit viral release from 293 cells, IFITMs failed to display a similar inhibitory effect [15] . Therefore, we initially compared their anti-HIV-1 activities in the same system, i.e., the co-transfection into 293 cells. Viral production was monitored by assessing the concentration of p24 Gag protein in the culture supernatants. In this study, we found that IFITM3 significantly reduced viral production when it was cotransfected with the proviral NL43 plasmid containing the whole viral sequence (Fig. 1A, left graph) . A similar inhibitory effect was also observed when IFITM3 was co-transfected with the vpu-deleted NL43 mutant (NL43-DVpu; right graph). When analyzed using the TZM-bl reporter cells, the infectivity of the WT viruses produced in the presence of IFITM3 was comparable to that of the control viruses (data not shown). Tetherin also reduced viral production, but its inhibitory effect was more marked when it was co-transfected with NL43-DVpu (Fig. 1A) . This was due to the ability of Vpu to down-regulate the cell surface expression of tetherin [14e19]. In the experiment shown in Fig. 1A , we used 0.6 mg IFITM3 expression plasmid. When the same amount of plasmid was used, tetherin displayed a lower expression level (Fig. 1B) but stronger inhibitory activity (Fig. 1A ) than IFITM3. These results indicated that the inhibitory effect of IFITM3 on viral production is modest when compared with that of tetherin, which explains why Neil et al. [15] failed to observe an inhibitory effect of IFITMs in their study. The importance was that IFITM3 and tetherin restricted HIV-1 at different steps because IFITM3 but not tetherin significantly reduced the expression levels of the p55 and p24 Gag proteins in the cells (Fig. 1C) . It therefore appears that tetherin inhibits the release of viruses without affecting intracellular Gag expression whereas IFITM3 directly reduces intracellular Gag expression, and thereby suppresses viral production.

            "text": "Tetherin and APOBEC3G are well-characterized HIV-1 restriction factors, but it is also known that HIV-1 proteins counteract their activities. Vpu and Vif induce the downregulation of the cell surface expression of tetherin [14e19] and the degradation of APOBEC3G [21e27], respectively. Indeed, tetherin inhibited the release of the Vpu (\u00c0) viruses more strongly than it inhibited the release of the wild-type viruses (Fig. 1A) . On the other hand, IFITM3 exhibited comparable inhibitory activity to these two viruses (Fig. 1A) . Therefore, we next examined whether HIV-1 proteins affect the localization or expression of IFITM family proteins. The Flagtagged IFITM1, 2, or 3 expression plasmid was co-transfected with the proviral plasmid (JRFL or NL43), but we did not detect any obvious changes in the cell surface expression of IFITMs ( Fig. 2A) . Although IFITM3 has been found to localize not only to the plasma membrane but also to the perinuclear region [7] , we did not detect any obvious changes in the intracellular distribution of IFITMs after their co-transfection with the proviral JRFL plasmid (Fig. 2B) . We also tested the effect of the overexpression of individual HIV-1 proteins. The Flag-tagged IFITM1, 2, or 3 expression plasmid was co-transfected with the codon-optimized version of the Vpu (Vphu) or Vif (HVif) plasmid, which bypassed the complicated viral-specific expression machinery and allowed efficient expression [31] , and the cell surface expression of Flag-IFITMs was analyzed by flow cytometry using anti-Flag antibody. Nef was also added to the analysis, as it down-regulates the expression of multiple cell surface proteins including CD4 [36] . However, none of the HIV-1 proteins down-regulated the cell surface expression of IFITMs (data not shown). The expression levels of Vpu and Nef under our experimental conditions were sufficient to downregulate tetherin and CD4, respectively (Fig. 2C ). The expression level of Vif under our experimental conditions was sufficient to induce the degradation of APOBEC3G (Western blotting, data not shown). These results indicate that IFITMs are resistant to the down-regulation of cell surface expression or the degradation by HIV-1 proteins. These findings are important because they imply that any HIV-1 proteins, unlike those of tetherin and APOBEC3G, do not counteract the anti-HIV-1 activities of IFITMs.",

There was no obvious difference in the inhibitory effect on viral production among IFITMs (Fig. 3A) . All the IFITMs reduced the production of both the NL43 and JRFL strain viruses (Fig. 3B, bar graph) , and this effect was strongly associated with reduced Gag expression (Fig. 3B, Gag blot) . Importantly, we found that IFITMs also reduced the expression of Nef and Vif (Nef and Vif blots). However, more important finding was that IFITM proteins did not induce any reduction in the expression of these viral proteins when they were co-transfected with the codonoptimized Gag expression plasmid (Fig. 4A , synGageGFP blot), the Nef expression plasmid (Fig. 4A, NefeGFP blot) , or the codon-optimized Vif expression plasmid (Fig. 4B, HVif  blot) . It is well characterized that Gag and Vif RNAs contain a double-stranded region (Rev response element; RRE), and the incompletely spliced RNAs encoding these viral proteins require the binding of HIV-1 Rev protein to the RRE sequences for their nuclear export and subsequent expression [37, 38] . Codon-optimization bypasses this complicated mechanism and allows these proteins to be expressed in a Revindependent manner [31, 37, 38] . Thus, our results raised the possibility that IFITMs selectively interfere with the Rev/ RRE-mediated expression of Gag and Vif. Indeed, IFITMs displayed an inhibitory effect on Gag expression in an artificial Rev-dependent expression system (Fig. 4C ). In this system, the codon-unoptimized and RRE sequence-containing GagePol and Gag expression plasmids (GagePoleRRE and Gag-RRE) were expressed at normal levels only in the presence of the Rev plasmid (Fig. 5B, first 2 lanes) . As a result, we found that IFITM1, 2, and 3 significantly reduced Rev/RREmediated Gag expression (lanes 3e5), as they did in the proviral plasmid-mediated expression system (see Fig. 3B ).",

Thus, we next examined whether another viral double-stranded RNA, i.e., the trans-activation response (TAR) element, was involved in the inhibitory activity of IFITMs. All of the HIV-1 RNAs including that encoding Nef contain the TAR element at their 5 0 end, which binds and activates the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) [39] . Once activated, PKR phosphorylates the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2a), which reduces the efficiency and rate of the translation initiation of proteins including viral proteins [39] . On the other hand, the HIV-1 Tat protein counteracts PKR activation via various complicated mechanisms, and the combination of the inhibitory pathways that prevent PKR activation determines the level of viral expression [39] . In this study, we found that the small molecule PKR inhibitor C16 restored the expression of p55Gag, Vif, and Nef, when it was added at effective but noncytotoxic concentrations (0.2e0.8 mM) [40, 41] to the cells that had been co-transfected with the proviral NL43 plasmid and IFITM3 (Fig. 5A) . Meanwhile, C16 did not restore Gag expression in the Tat/TAR-independent but Rev/RREdependent expression system (Fig. 5B) , which was consistent with the fact that TAR, but not RRE, induces strong PKR activation [39] . Therefore, our results (Figs. 3e5) suggested that IFITMs reduced the expression of Gag, and possibly Vif, by interfering with both Rev/RRE-and Tat/TARmediated expression, and reduced the expression of Nef by interfering with Tat/TAR-mediated expression. Again, the inhibitory effect was not non-specific because IFITMs did not affect the levels of these viral proteins when they were expressed via the system that bypassed the viral-specific machinery (see Fig. 4A and B).",

Therefore, we finally examined whether the S-palmitoylation of IFITMs is important for their anti-HIV-1 activity. To this end, we prepared three different mutants of Flag-tagged IFITM3 and IFITM2, in which the S-palmitoylated cysteine residues were mutated singly or in combination to alanine (Fig. 6A) . Consistent with the finding that the first two cysteines were more heavily S-palmitoylated than the third cysteine [7] , the mutants in which the first two cysteines were substituted (C1/2A and C1/2/3A) displayed more marked changes in their intracellular localization (Fig. 6B, arrows) . However, unlike in the case of the anti-influenza virus activity of IFITM3, it was found that the S-palmitoylation was not necessary for the anti-HIV-1 activity of IFITMs because all of the mutants of IFITM3 and IFITM2 reduced the concentrations of p24 Gag in the supernatants (Fig. 6C , bar graph) and the expression levels of p55 and p24 Gag proteins in the cells (Gag blot).

Campbell et al., Science 264 (1994) 492.], careful studies will be necessary in order to clarify the exact mechanisms by which IFITMs interfere with the viral protein expression mediated by the double-stranded viral RNAs such as RRE and TAR. Studies will be also necessary to explain why there was no obvious difference in the anti-HIV-1 activity among three IFITM proteins in our transfection assay, in contrast to the study by Lu et al. [12] . Despite these unanswered questions, the present study demonstrated that IFITMs possess different characteristics from other anti-HIV-1 proteins such as tetherin and APOBEC3G and supported the idea that IFITMs restrict HIV-1 and influenza viruses at distinct steps.
