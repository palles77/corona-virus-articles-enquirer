The aim of this study was to establish an epithelial cell line from caruncles of pregnant cows and to develop a model to study restricted trophoblast invasion, pathogenesis of pregnancy associated diseases and pathways of infection and transport. Primary epithelial cells were isolated, successfully subcultured for 32 passages and cryopreserved at various stages. The cultures were termed bovine caruncular epithelial cell line-1 (BCEC-1). Cytokeratin, zonula occludens-1 protein and vimentin but neither a-smooth muscle actin nor desmin were detected by immunofluorescence performed every 5 (AE1) passages. These results were confirmed by Western blotting. BCEC-1 were then cultured either without matrix or on fibronectin or collagen coated Transwell \u00d2 polyester membrane inserts, respectively, enabling separate access to the basal or apical epithelial compartments. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy of BCEC-1 revealed ultrastructural features also observed in vivo, such as apical microvilli and junctional complexes. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was measured regularly and revealed an increase with advancing confluence in all cultures. Cultures on coated inserts reached confluence and corresponding TEERlevels at an earlier stage. In addition, the cells were tested negative for bovine virus diarrhoea (BVD) virus, but were permissive for the virus. In conclusion, the BCEC-1 cell line retained characteristics of maternal caruncular epithelial cells as observed in vivo and in primary cell cultures and thus will be a highly useful tool for future studies of pathways of invasion, fetalematernal communication, transport and infection.",

A special feature is the occurrence of ''restricted'' trophoblast invasion performed by trophoblast giant cells migrating towards and fusing with maternal epithelial cells [1, 2] . Trophoblast invasion may be compared with tumour invasion but in contrast to tumour cells, the trophoblast can regulate its tumour-like attributes and the depth of invasion is limited in a species-specific manner [3] . In the bovine, this migration takes place between only two cell layers suggesting the bovine placenta to be an ideal model to study invasive processes. So far, the expression of potential regulating factors has been studied on in vivo material only [2, 4, 5] .",

Furthermore, the few studies undertaken failed to differentiate between the cell types, epithelial cells in particular [12] . So far only one bovine endometrial (epithelial) cell line (BEND) originating from a non-pregnant animal has been characterised and deposited at the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC# CRL-2398) [13] . The BEND cell line has been used successfully in many studies; the majority of which have dealt with prostaglandin synthesis and regulation pathways [14, 15] . However, since it was derived from a non-pregnant animal without differentiating between caruncular and intercaruncular regions, it raises the question as whether it is suitable to study processes occurring during pregnancy. Moreover, the ATCC tested the cells positive for the virus of bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD), a disease of great importance in bovine medicine and management, since it can lead to a reduced milk yield, decreased fertility and abortion. If transmitted intrauterinely to the fetus within the first 120 days of pregnancy, the calf develops an immune tolerance resulting in persistent infection. Superinfection or mutations within the virus in the first few months after birth result in the development of the lethal mucosal disease [16] .",

It was demonstrated that these cells expressed the epithelial specific proteins cytokeratin and tight junctional zonula occludens-1 as well as integrin subunits and proteins of the extracellular matrix. Endothelial origin could be excluded by the absence of low density lipoprotein (LDL) labelling. Furthermore, it was shown that cryopreservation of the cells is possible.

In this study, all antibodies were applied to sections of placentomal tissue (in vivo control) and primary cultures demonstrating cell type specific binding. Briefly, cultures were washed in 0.02 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.3) containing 0.3% Tween-20 (SigmaeAldrich) three times between each incubation step. Sera and antibodies were diluted in a PBS/0.3% Tween containing 0.1 g/ml bovine serum albumin and glycerol at a ratio of 2:1 (pH 8.0).

The following three passages were characterised by a low viability of the cells (Fig. 1) and confluence was hardly reached. By day 14 in culture no further proliferation was observed.

As has been previously shown in primary cultures of caruncular epithelial cells [17] , the BCEC-1 cell line also consistently expressed epithelial cytokeratin and tight junctional zonula occludens-1 as well as vimentin, an intermediate filament protein of mesenchymal origin [23] . The expression of vimentin in primary epithelial cell cultures and epithelial cell lines is a well known phenomenon irrespective of which tissue or organ they were isolated from. It has been described in endometrial cell cultures derived from sheep, pigs, dogs, rats and humans [24e28]. Furthermore, primary epithelial cells isolated from the Fig. 1 .

From passage 12 onwards viability and proliferation increased markedly resulting in constant time periods (7 days AE 1) in which confluence was reached. endometrium of non-pregnant cows as well as the BEND cell line were shown to be positive for vimentin [29e31] .

In comparison, the BEND cell line was successfully subcultured for at least 25 passages [14] . In BCEC-1 the variable and prolonged cultivation periods until confluence during the initial passages are partly referable to the process of spontaneous immortalisation. A similar growth pattern was observed during the establishment of the human breast epithelial cell line MCF-10 [32] . The number of viable and proliferating cells decreased within the first 7 passages and spontaneous immortalisation occurred beyond passage 12. Nonetheless, it should be taken into account that the BCEC-1 cells were not counted prior to each seeding and therefore the number of cells transferred to the new flasks was not identical on each occasion. Thus, the differing periods until confluence was reached could possibly be related to different numbers of cells per passage. Nevertheless, the number of days between two passages remained relatively constant between passages 12 and 30. Later experiments with cryopreserved BCEC-1 cells enabled the defining of an optimal seeding density of 7500 cells/cm 2 , resulting in a subcultivation ratio of 1:4 and a cultivation period of 6 days until confluence on fibronectin coated flasks. These values corresponded to those suggested by the ATCC for the BEND cell line.",

In most cases fibronectin resulted in higher TEER values than coating with collagen A (personal observations). The positive effect of fibronectin on growth properties of the monolayer was confirmed by the results obtained from cell counting of primary caruncular epithelial cells cultured on different extracellular matrices [34] . Fibronectin is a soluble multiadhesive matrix protein and a major component of the extracellular matrix. Amongst other locations in the bovine placenta, fibronectin is expressed in the basement membrane of the caruncular epithelium [2] . In addition, in primary cultures of caruncular epithelial cells fibronectin secretion was shown to be associated with the expression of specific integrin receptors [18] . Fibronectin secretion is a frequently observed feature of epithelial cell cultures and occurs particularly at the basolateral surface [35, 36] . Taken together these results provide evidence that fibronectin may have a positive effect on the culture conditions of BCEC-1, a procedure which is now used routinely when working with this cell line.",

Bovine virus diarrhoea (BVD) is a disease of great importance in bovine medicine and has a worldwide distribution [16] . If transmitted transplacentally to the fetus within the first 120 days of pregnancy, the calf develops an immune tolerance resulting in persistent infection with a non-cytopathogenic (ncp) BVD virus. In the first few months after birth superinfection with ncp-virus or mutations within the virus leading to a transformation into a cytopathogenic (cp) virus, result in the development of the lethal mucosal disease. Immunohistological showing the TEER development of a BCEC-1 passage 12 culture seeded in duplicates (a \u00fe b) on uncoated as well as collagen A (Coll) and fibronectin (Fn) coated Transwell insert membranes. Culture on coated inserts lead to an increase in proliferation and an earlier attainment of confluence as demonstrated by an increase of TEER values at an earlier stage when compared to uncoated inserts. This was the case in all experiments. In the experiment shown confluence (arrows) was reached in fibronectin and collagen A coated inserts within day 9 and 10, respectively, whereas the cultures grown on uncoated inserts were close to confluence by the end of the measurements at day 11. Cultures of primary caruncular fibroblasts (Fibro) reaching confluence by day 6 served as negative controls. studies demonstrated strong staining of BVD virus antigen in the caruncular epithelial cells of pregnant persistently infected animals [37] . To date, the pathways of infection in a polarised cell culture model derived from the tissue actually participating in vertical transmission have not yet been studied. In a comparable polarised cell culture model of human bronchial epithelial cells (Calu-3) the entry and release of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV) almost exclusively from the apical border was demonstrated [38] .",
