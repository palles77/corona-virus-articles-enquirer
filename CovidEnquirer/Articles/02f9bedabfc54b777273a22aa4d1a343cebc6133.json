Two peptides denoted HR-N(SN50) and HR-C(SC40), corresponding to the Leu/Ile/Val-rich heptad-repeat regions from the N-terminal and C-terminal segments of the SARS-CoV spike S2 sequence, respectively, were synthesized and predicted to form trimeric assembly of hairpin-like structures. The polyclonal antibodies produced by recombinant S2 protein were tested for antigenicity of the two heptad repeats. We report here the first crystallographic study of the SARS spike HR-N/HR-C complex. The crystal belongs to the triclinic space group P1 and the data-set collected to 2.98 \u00c5 resolution showed noncrystallographic pseudo-222 and 3-fold symmetries. Based on these data, comparative modeling of the SARS-CoV fusion core was performed. The immunological and structural information presented herein may provide a more detailed understanding of the viral fusion mechanism as well as the development of effective therapy against SARS-CoV infection.",

Two functional domains at the amino and carboxy termini of the S protein (S1 and S2, respectively) are conserved among the coronaviruses. As shown in Fig. 1 , the transmembrane segment is close to the C terminus of the S2 subunit. Adjacent to both the fusion peptide-like region and transmembrane segments are two regions containing 4,3-hydrophobic heptad repeats (HR), a sequence motif suggestive of coiled-coil structures [4] . These regions are denoted HR-N and HR-C, respectively, and are separated by an intervening domain of 200 residues. The S1 and S2 domain of SARS-CoV S protein can be identified by sequence alignment with other coronavirus S proteins, especially with the more conserved S2 domain [5, 6] . These coiled-coil regions are thought to play an important role in defining the oligomeric structure of the spike protein in its native state and its fusogenic ability [7] .",

Additionally, complex formation was also observed with the HR-N/HR-C (1:10) but without complete disappearance of the individual HR-C component. Therefore, the two sets of data, CD and PAGE, strongly suggest that HR-N/HR-C form a stable helical complex derived from the key region of interaction and agree with the previous reports of the post-fusion states of type-I viral protein fusion core. Some interesting phenomenon was observed on the native PAGE gel. Beside the major bands, smearing bands appear in the lanes of either HR-C or HR-N/HR-C which may be caused by the equilibrium between the ordered and disordered HR-C peptides. Furthermore, the various combinations of HR-N and HR-C (HR-N homotrimer, HR-N/HR-C heterodimer, trimer of the HR-N/HR-C heterodimer, and HR-N/HR-C complex with dynamic equilibrium of HR-C release) could form several major bands on the native 4-12% gradient gel (Fig. 3A) .

Prior to data collection, crystals were mounted in a cryoloop and the reservoir solution with addition of 5% PEG200 was used as a cryoprotectant. Initially, due to the fact that the unit cell is nearly orthorhombic, attempts were made to process the data sets by the space group of P222 and P2. However, the results were not acceptable. Finally, the crystals were determined to belong to the triclinic space group P1 with unit-cell parameters a = 50.99 \u00c5 , b = 58.40 \u00c5 , c = 76.03 \u00c5 , and a = 90.52\u00b0, b = 89.99\u00b0, a = 89.98\u00b0as well as unit-cell volume of 226,382 \u00c5 3 .

The self-rotation function maps revealed three perpendicular 2-fold axes and a 3-fold axis (data not shown). These non-crystallographic symmetries suggest that the SN50/SC40 complex forms three-helical bundles whose long axis is approximately parallel to the crystallographic c-axis, and there are probably four such trimeric assemblies in an asymmetric unit related by pseudo-222 symmetry. This prediction is further justified by calculating the Matthews coefficient V m [14] , which is 1.91 \u00c5 3 /Da by assuming 4 timers of HR-N/HR-C in an asymmetric unit with a solvent content of about 35%.",

The result revealed that the anti-S2 antibodies could recognize HR-N better than HR-C, suggesting a greater immunogenicity for the HR-N region.

Alignments of the HR-N and HR-C peptides on the corresponding MHV spike N-peptides and C-peptides revealed reasonable sequence similarities. Thus, we could confidently build a homology model of the HR-N and HR-C association based on the X-ray crystal structure of the MHV spike core formed between the N-peptides and C-peptides. HR-N peptides possessed a typical triple coiled-coil structure as shown by the red ribbons in Fig. 4B . Half of HR-C (blue ribbons) had an a-helical conformation with the exception of an extended coil in the middle of the structure. Surface map representation shows the presence of the hydrophobic grooves on the surface of three central HR-N helices. Three HR-C helices pack against the hydrophobic groove in an anti-parallel manner. The extended coil region packs against the shallow groove, but the helical region of HR-C packs against the deep groove (Fig. 4C ). The sequences between SARS-CoV and MHV share 66% and 54% similarity (56% and 28% identity) in the aligned HR-N and HR-C regions, respectively. The residues at the ''a'' and ''d'' positions in the HR-N and HR-C regions are hydrophobic (Fig. 4A ). The complex structure derived from superimposing with the MHV crystal structure also shows that there are hydrophobic interactions between these two peptides (Fig. 4C) .

In addition, the comparative modeling is applied to build the homology model of SARS-CoV fusion core. On the basis of the model, we could further design the suitable peptide derivatives for solving the crystal phase and peptide analogs for efficient inhibition of virus entry. The docking experiments of the SARS-CoV fusion core model are also being carried out for virtual screening of anti-virus drugs.",

HR-N peptide alone is not visible because it is positively charged (pI = 9.53) under the gel electrophoresis condition (buffer pH 8.3 and the positive-charge electrode on the bottom). By contrast, HR-C (pI = 4.44) and HR-N/HR-C complex (pI = 5.22) are negatively charged and observed on the native PAGE gel. The HR-N and HR-C mixture at molar ratio 1:10 on the gel reveals the decrease of HR-C band and the formation of HR-N/HR-C complex. (B) Dot blotting immunoassay of HR-N and HR-C peptides shows the higher antigenicity of HR-N region.",
