            "text": "Comparing sequences of archived viruses collected over many years to the present allows the study of viral evolution and contributes to the design of new vaccines. However, the difficulty, time and expense of generating full-length sequences individually from each archived sample have hampered these studies. Next generation sequencing technologies have been utilized for analysis of clinical and environmental samples to identify viral pathogens that may be present. This has led to the discovery of many new, uncharacterized viruses from a number of viral families. Use of these sequencing technologies would be advantageous in examining viral evolution. In this study, a sequencing procedure was used to sequence simultaneously and rapidly multiple archived samples using a single standard protocol. This procedure utilized primers composed of 20 bases of known sequence with 8 random bases at the 3 -end that also served as an identifying barcode that allowed the differentiation each viral library following pooling and sequencing. This conferred sequence independence by random priming both first and second strand cDNA synthesis. Viral stocks were treated with a nuclease cocktail to reduce the presence of host nucleic acids. Viral RNA was extracted, followed by single tube random-primed double-stranded cDNA synthesis. The resultant cDNAs were amplified by primer-specific PCR, pooled, size fractionated and sequenced on the Ion Torrent PGM platform. The individual virus genomes were readily assembled by both de novo and template-assisted assembly methods. This procedure consistently resulted in near full length, if not full-length, genomic sequences and was used to sequence multiple bovine pestivirus and coronavirus isolates simultaneously.",

After isolation/propagation of the viruses on appropriate host cells, the medium was frozen/thawed twice, cell debris removed by centrifugation, and aliquots frozen at \u221280 \u2022 C. Routinely, the libraries were constructed from groups of 10 viruses.

A cocktail of nucleases was added to degrade host nucleic acids as previously described (Victoria et al., 2008) .

Table 1 shows the sequence of the 20 primers used in this study. These primers were developed so that the 20 base known sequence was used for PCR amplification of the library as well as served as a barcode for identifying each viral library following pooling and sequencing. The RNA/primer mix was heated at 75 \u2022 C for 5 min and immediately placed on ice. First strand synthesis was done in a reaction mix consisting of 0.5 mM dNTPs, 1\u00d7 first strand buffer, 2 units RNasin (Promega) and 200 units SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies). The first strand reactions were incubated at 42 \u2022 C for 1 h, heated at 95 \u2022 C for 2 min and immediately quenched on ice. The second strand reaction was carried out using Sequenase 2.0 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and the nucleotides and primers still present following the first strand reaction (Yozwiak et al., 2012 ). An equal volume of 2\u00d7 Sequenase buffer with 4 units of Sequenase per reaction was added on ice. The reaction tubes were placed in a thermocycler that was prechilled to 4 \u2022 C and were ramped from 4 \u2022 C to 37 \u2022 C at 0.1 \u2022 C/s. The reaction was continued at 37 \u2022 C for 10 min. The tubes were heated to 95 \u2022 C for 2 min and placed immediately on ice. A second aliquot of Sequenase was added (4 units/reaction) and the ramping and incubation repeated with the exception that the 37 \u2022 C reaction was done for 30 min. The double stranded cDNA was purified using Minelute PCR spin columns (Qiagen) and eluted with 13 l of ultra-pure H 2 O. The cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers consisting of the first 20 known bases of the 28mer used in the cDNA synthesis . The PCR reactions consisted of 10 l of double-stranded cDNA, 1\u00d7 Pfx50 buffer, 400 M dNTPs, 100 pM of appropriate 20mer primer and 5 units of Pfx50 polymerase (Life Technologies). The reactions were cycled at 95 \u2022 C for 2 min and 35 cycles of 95 \u2022 C for 30 s, 55 \u2022 C for 30 s and 72 \u2022 C for 1 min. The number of cycles was empirically determined so as not to over amplify the cDNA, where 35 cycles worked well. The DNA was again purified and eluted in 10 l ultra-pure H 2 O, and 1 l subjected to Agilent Bioanalyzer analysis (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The percentage of the DNA that was 300-400 bp in length was determined for each reaction as was the total DNA concentration in each sample using PicoGreen (Life Technologies). All ten reactions were pooled so that the 300-400 bp cDNAs from each were present in equimolar amounts. The pooled DNA was placed in an end-repair reaction (Ion Plus Fragment Library kit, Life Technologies) followed by ligation of Ion Torrent sequencing adaptors. The DNA was size fractionated using Agencourt Ampure Beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA) using 1.6 volumes of the Ampure beads and was done according to manufacturer specifications. This step removed DNA of 100 bp and less which eliminated adaptor dimers and unligated adaptors. At this point, two 10-genome libraries, for a total of 20 genomes, were pooled for each sequencing run. The 300-400 bp fraction was isolated from the DNA pool using the Pippin Prep (Sage Science, Beverly, MA, USA). The 300-400 bp DNA was subjected to sequence analysis with the Ion Torrent PGM and standard chemistries (Life Technologies) using the 316 sequencing chip.",

The \"fastx trimmer\" program (part of the Fastx ToolKit; http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx toolkit/index.html) was used to remove the random primer (8-mer) by trimming an additional eight nucleotides from the 5 -end of each read. As a final post-trimming step, a custom script was used to remove all reads that were less than 40 nucleotides in length. The resulting sequence files were used to assemble full length genomic sequences using SeqManNGen and were edited with the SeqMan software of the Lasergene 10 package (DNAstar, Inc., Madison, WI, USA) using related viral sequences obtained from GenBank as the assembly reference. Assembled genomic sequences were further edited using Aligner (Codoncode, Inc., Centerville, MA, USA). The sequences from each library were submitted to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive with the BioProject number PRJNA237789, BioSamples SAMN02630193, and SAMN02639534 through SAMN02639572.",

Thus, it required more sequences overall to assemble the complete genome to the same coverage depth. Additionally, because BoCV typically grows to a lower titer, there were lower ratios of virus:host sequences, ranging from 2.7 to 37.8% of the total sequences. A major difference in genome assembly between BVDV and BoCV was that, with only a few exceptions, both the 5 and 3 terminal sequences were determined for each BoCV isolate. Also, due to the longer length of the BoCV genome, more assembly gaps were observed. However, in all cases, assembled sequences spanned more than 97% of the viral genome. More assembly gaps were observed in individual virus libraries having lower total sequences.

This sequencing protocol was designed to sequence viruses rapidly that were isolated from clinical specimens and archived. Often, a clinical report and history is available for isolates making it possible to begin association of genotype with specific phenotypes and time of isolation. Particularly valuable is that this protocol confers the ability to sequence archival collections of specific viruses rapidly in order to study the evolution of the pathogen over time and determine the genotype of the viruses currently in circulation.

Thus, the abundance of host nucleic acids posed a problem in obtaining sufficient numbers of viral sequences to assemble the viral genomes. It was necessary to pre-digest virus samples with high levels of nucleases before purification of viral RNA. The viral RNA was protected within the intact virions while the host RNA and DNA were degraded. The RNA purification procedure included a protease digestion step aiding in the removal of the nucleases before the viral RNA was released from the virion. The nuclease digestion step aided in reaching as much as 87% of all sequences in a barcoded library being of viral origin. Again, the titer of the virus in the original sample was also important in the number of viral sequences obtained. Viruses that grow routinely to low titers require less than 20 libraries in the sequencing run to ensure sufficient reads in each barcoded library to assemble the genomes.",

For the most part, the 316 chip worked well, routinely giving sufficient sequencing depth to assemble the genomes of 20 viruses in each sequencing run. The Ion Torrent is known to have indels in the sequence data, especially associated with homopolymeric runs of bases (Bragg et al., 2013) . Use of template assisted assembly of the genomes greatly assisted in producing accurate genome assemblies. Limited numbers of de novo assemblies were done and low numbers of errors were found that were attributed to indels. The accuracy of sequences generated by this method was demonstrated by the comparing sequences to those previously generated by Sanger PCR amplicon sequencing. Only 1 nucleotide difference was detected in sequences generated using the two different methods demonstrating the accuracy of the sequencing using the protocol described in this paper. The genomic sequences of the BVDV isolates were readily assembled from the sequence data, partially owing to the relatively small size of the genomic RNA. However, the extreme 5 and 3 terminal nucleotides were difficult to obtain, most likely due to the high degree of secondary structure known to be present in these sequences. This may have made priming of first strand cDNA synthesis near the termini more difficult. With the exception of one virus, all BVDV genomes were assembled with no internal gaps in the sequence. The BVDV genome that was not fully assembled had only 658 total viral sequences, yet this was sufficient to assemble greater than 94% of the genome. The low number of sequences was most like due to a pipetting error during the pooling of the 10 individual genomic libraries. This illustrates the importance of accurate quantitation and pipetting of the individual libraries in making the DNA pool used in the template preparation for sequencing.",

This would require, at least initially, de novo assembly and BLAST analysis to determine if viral sequences were present.
