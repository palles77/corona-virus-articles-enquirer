PBL influenced both the way the curriculum was developed and the process by which students (n = 18) investigated topics related to the integration of ICT in business studies classrooms. The evaluation was based on five evaluative questions dealing with the implementation of PBL, the extent to which PBL facilitated academic discourse, the extent of \u00d4new\u00d5 knowledge about ICT that had been created, the role of the tutor, and the online learning environment provided. The evaluation revealed that PBL provided a practical approach to investigating ICT in both face-to-face and online learning environments, leading to \u00d4new\u00d5 knowledge about challenges associated with the adoption and use of new technologies in various educational settings.",

While different \u00d4models\u00d5 have been used, the basic premise is that PBL is \u00d4a way of constructing and teaching courses using problems as the stimulus and focus for student activity\u00d5 (Boud & Feletti, 1991, p. 14) . When investigating \u00d4real-life\u00d5 problems, students work co-operatively in a small group, usually with the assistance of a tutor and with access to other resources to: (a) clarify the problem; (b) identify learning needs to address the problem; (c) undertake individual reading/study; and, (d) apply newly acquired insights and understandings to re-address the problem. The aim is that students acquire \u00d4knowledge and skills through a staged sequence of problems presented in context\u00d5 (Boud & Feletti, 1991, p. 14) .",

The aims of using ICT, and why these have been selected, need to be examined critically so that the implications for teaching, learning, content and assessment can be clarified and ideas about new directions in which to proceed can be elaborated. At the same time, many practical matters associated with the management of ICT resources have to be considered. Given these challenges, it was considered that the adoption of an explicit PBL pedagogy would be an appropriate way in which students could critically examine recent policy initiatives in ICT (and curriculum reforms outlined in other policy documents) and, at the same time grapple with the difficulties which often arise when attempts are made to translate new initiatives into practice in the school setting. Presenting the mature age teachers enrolled in this MEd module with an opportunity to discuss ICT in a structured way also raised the possibility that new knowledge/insights about using ICT in schools might be generated which was considered to be less likely to occur when only a tutor\u00d5s perspective was under consideration and evaluation. Hence, the module was designed around genuine problems in an attempt to create \u00d4new\u00d5 knowledge about ICT in the business curriculum.",

Tutors must adopt a position on the margin of the group(s) as problems are investigated, yet intervene decisively as needed when problems have not been appropriately addressed and procedures need to be clarified. The extent to which the tutor could accomplish these roles when the face-to-face discussions in three groups could not be constantly monitored added to the importance of investigating this question.

As a strategy for self-directed learning, PBL involves a willingness amongst participants to contribute ideas to discussions and work collaboratively to investigate problems. The extent to which this occurred can be revealed by quantifying the contributions of participants at each stage of the investigation of a topic. This showed that student contributions to discussions varied greatly, ranging from 36% to 6% (mean = 18.2; SD = 9.8) in session one, and from 29% to 6% (mean = 14.3; SD = 8.05) in session two. While these variations may be due to lack of familiarity with content discussed, they may also be due to: (a) confidence with English as a second language; (b) the assigned roles of leader and recorder/presenter; and (c) the lack of awareness by the leader of the need to encourage all group members to contribute. While the differences in participation did not appear to impact on the outcomes of the group on these occasions, their existence suggests that there is a need to outline the expectations of leaders rather than assume -as in this case -that leaders have sufficient knowledge and experience to manage groups efficiently. An analysis was also completed of the online discussion to examine the extent to which participants contributed messages and worked collaboratively to investigate Topic 3.

However, the views attributed to the Head of Department in the case study -which represented the views of the tutor for the module -are prominent while other views about new technology, such as those of other teachers in the case study remain in the background. This tended to put students in the module in the role of \u00d4problem solver\u00d5 (how the Head of Department could get what she wanted) rather than \u00d4problem investigator\u00d5 (what views did teachers have about ICT and how could these impact on the adoption of new technology). On reflection, it was felt that other views should have been more prominent. As Fenwick and Parsons (1998, p. 11 ) note: there may sometimes be pedagogical purposes best served through student analysis of predetermined cases. But when descriptive situations are presented to students, they require a great deal of narrative and contextual detail, providing as many perspectives as possible. Rather than casting a student professional into the role of the omniscient solver in these cases, they might serve a better purpose as stories of how a particular person or group of people defined a situation and responded to it. Pre-service professionals could then spend time analysing how these problem cases selected for study have been constructed and what assumptions about right practice and ways of viewing the world are embedded in their frameworks. Students can explore ways the problem-namer lives within the situation configured as problematic.",
