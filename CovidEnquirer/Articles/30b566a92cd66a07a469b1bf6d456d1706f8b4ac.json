            "text": "Several events over the past 23 years have changed the way scientists acquire and work with pathogenic microorganisms and biological toxins in the United States (US) and internationally (Morse, 2015) . These events, which have increased national and international awareness of the potential or real threat of terrorism (including bioterrorism), include the unlawful attempt by an individual with ties to white supremacist groups to acquire Yersinia pestis (Carus, 2002) ; the documented unsuccessful anthrax attack in Kameido, Tokyo (Olsen, 1999; Takahashi et al., 1993; Danzig et al., 2011) and the release of the nerve agent sarin in the subway system of Tokyo in 1995 by the Aum Shinrikyo (Olsen, 1999; Danzig et al., 2011; Kaplan, 2000) ; the bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995 (Smoak and Geiling, 2004) ; the terrorist attacks using commercial airlines on September 11, 2001 (Smoak and Geiling, 2004) ; and the 2001 anthrax attacks in the US (Cole, 2003; Decker, 2018) . The 2001 anthrax attack was a major impetus in the development of the field of microbial forensics. In an effort to control the misuse of dangerous pathogens and toxins by those wishing to do harm, the US passed several laws (Public Law 104-132, 1996; Public Law 107-188, 2002; Public Law 107-56, 2001 ) and subsequently promulgated regulations (i.e., Select Agent Regulations) (42 C.F.R; 9 C.F.R; 7 C.F.R) designed to limit unauthorized access to these agents. For a historical perspective on the development of these regulations, the reader is referred to Morse (2015) . The creation of an oversight role for the federal government in the area of biological sciences has evoked concern within the scientific community and is considered by some to actually increase societal vulnerability to biological attacks and natural epidemics (Casadevall and Relman, 2010) . The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the Select Agent Regulations and other regulations that will impact the practice of microbial forensics.",

Entities must register with either the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) or the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) if they plan to possess, use, or transfer agents or toxins on the HHS or USDA select agent list, respectively. If the select agent or toxin is an overlap agent (i.e., regulated by both HHS and USDA), the entity may register with either HHS or APHIS, but is not required to register with both. Because the registration process, including the requirement for security risk assessments, may be time-consuming, an entity contemplating working with select agents or toxins should initiate the process well ahead of time. While registration is both agent and laboratory specific, the registration can be amended to include additional agents and laboratory spaces. A registration lasts for a maximum of 3 years (but may be granted for a shorter period of time).",

However, these toxins are subject to the regulation only if the aggregate amount of the toxin under the control of a principal investigator, treating physician or veterinarian, or commercial manufacturer or distributor exceeds the amount specified in the regulations (see Table 28 .2). These de minimis amounts represent an attempt to balance the requirement for regulatory oversight of toxins that have the potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety with the need for their availability for critical research, forensic, and educational purposes.

For example, positive strand RNA viruses (e.g., Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus) and certain DNA viruses that utilize host polymerases contain nucleic acids that can be used to produce infectious forms of the viruses. Such nucleic acids are subject to the select agent regulations. Any organism that contains regulated recombinant or synthetic nucleic acids are subject to the regulations unless the organisms or nucleic acids are excluded as (i) a nonviable select agent or nontoxic toxin; (ii) an excluded attenuated strain, or (iii) an excluded Under the current select agent regulations, the following are examples of genomic materials from select agent viruses that would not be regulated as a select agent: (i) material from regulated genomes that has been rendered noninfectious; (ii) cDNA made from genomes of regulated select agent pathogens; and (iii) complete genomes of single-stranded, negative-strand RNA viruses, double-stranded RNA viruses, and doublestranded DNA viruses that require a unique polymerase (e.g., monkeypox virus). The select agent regulations do not apply to variola major genetic elements because the World Health Organization (WHO) has already placed significant restrictions on the possession, use, and transfer of these materials. Institutions other than the two currently recognized WHO collaborating centers (CDC, Atlanta, GA, and State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology, Koltsovo, Novosibirsk, Russia) may not possess genetic fragments exceeding 20% of the variola major virus genome (for further information refer to http://www. who.int/csr/disease/smallpox/research/en/). These restrictions are followed by the CDC but are not legally binding. However, 18 U.S.C. x 175c makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly produce, engineer, synthesize, acquire, transfer directly or indirectly, receive, possess, import, export, or use, or possess and threaten to use the variola virus.

The Board recommended that the government should take steps to increase awareness among providers and users of synthetic genomic materials regarding compliance with the select agent regulations and provide providers with a list of genomic materials explicitly covered by the regulations. In response, HHS developed recommended baseline standards for the gene and genome synthesis industry and other providers of synthetic double-stranded DNA products regarding the screening or orders so that they are filled in compliance with current US regulations (Department of Health and Human Services, 2010).

Nevertheless, the 2005 Select Agent Final Rule applied the same regulatory controls regardless of the agent, which made it difficult to conduct legitimate research using less pathogenic select agents (Casadevall and Relman, 2010 ; National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity, 2009). Therefore, it was recommended by a government advisory board (National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity, 2009) that the list of select agents be reduced or stratified. Subsequently, Executive Order 13546, which was signed on July 2, 2010, directed the Secretaries of HHS and USDA to designate those select agents that pose the greatest risk of deliberate misuse with the greatest potential for mass casualties or devastating effects to the economy, critical infrastructure, or public confidence as Tier 1 agents and toxins (see organisms indicated by footnote c in Table 28 .1) and amend their respective regulations to establish security standards specific to these agents and toxins (The President, 2010). A federal panel employed several criteria, as well as information from the intelligence community, to identify 13 agents that were classified as Tier 1 (Bhattacharjee, 2011) . The number of Tier 1 agents was subsequently increased to 14 in 2016 by the addition of B. cereus biovar anthracis (CDC and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2016). Currently, only nucleic acids that encode the toxic forms of botulinum neurotoxins, or infectious forms of Foot-and-Mouth Disease virus, are regulated as a Tier 1 agent, which means that all Tier 1 regulatory requirements apply to these nucleic acids (see below).",

A few examples of exemptions should suffice. A clinical laboratory that isolates a select agent from a clinical specimen is exempt from requirements of the select agent regulation, provided that (i) within 7 calendar days after identification, the select agent is transferred in accordance with the regulation or destroyed on-site by a recognized sterilization process (Isolation of a Tier 1 select agent or toxin requires the immediate notification of the Select Agent Program by telephone, facsimile, or email) followed within 7 calendar days by the submission of an APHIS/CDC Form 4; (ii) the select agent is secured against theft, loss, or release during the period between identification and transfer or destruction; and (iii) identification of the select agent is reported to the CDC or APHIS and to other appropriate authorities when required by federal, state, or local law.

The recipient must also have a certificate of registration that includes the particular select agent or toxin at the time of transfer. To obtain an authorization for transfer, APHIS/CDC Form 2 must be submitted to either the CDC or APHIS. This authorization for transfer is only valid for 30 calendar days after issuance. After an authorized transfer, the recipient must submit a completed APHIS/CDC Form 2 within 2 business days after the select agent or toxin is received. In the event that the select agent or toxin has not been received within 48 h after the expected delivery time or if the package has been damaged to the extent that a release of the select agent or toxin may have occurred, the recipient must notify the CDC or APHIS immediately. It is also important to note that the sender must comply with all applicable laws concerning the packaging and shipping of hazardous materials. Select agents are not permitted in the US postal system. Select agents are considered hazardous materials and fall under the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) of the US Department of Transportation (DOT). HMR are issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and govern the interstate transportation of materials by highway, rail, vessel, and air. HMR are the legally enforceable shipping regulations for hazardous materials in the US and are enforced by the Federal Aviation Administration for air transport. For complete information, see 49 C.F.R. xx171-180 at http://www.phmsa.dot. gov/hazmat/regs. The DOT HMR applies to the offering, acceptance, and transportation of hazardous materials to, from, or within the US and to any aircraft of US registry anywhere in air commerce. Select agents, infectious substances, toxins, and other dangerous goods are not allowed in the passenger compartment of aircraft. Transportation of an infectious substance by a federal, state, or local government agency or the military in a vehicle (e.g., automobile, truck, airplane) operated by a government or military employee is not subject to the HMR, which may be important, in certain circumstances, for transporting forensic evidence containing an infectious substance or toxin by law enforcement or military personnel.",

It includes four assessments: an agent-specific risk assessment, threat assessment, vulnerability assessment, and graded protection determination. Before being issued a certificate of registration, an entity must comply with all security requirements (and all other provisions of the Select Agent Regulations). To assist entities in developing and implementing the required written security plan, the CDC and APHIS developed a Security Risk Assessment Tool to assist in creating the entity's site-specific risk assessment, which is the core of a robust security plan. The Security Risk Assessment Tool and specific guidance for developing and implementing a security plan in compliance with the select agent regulations are available at https://www.selectagents.gov/compliance. html.

Performing research of select agents and toxins is also critical for the development of effective medical countermeasures and, ultimately, the development of effective vaccines. The Select Agent Regulation has been in effect for more than 20 years. During this time, hundreds of entities have registered with the CDC or APHIS to possess, use, or transfer select agents and toxins, and thousands of individuals have been approved to work with these agents at registered facilities. The CDC and APHIS have developed a highly integrated regulatory oversight program, characterized by uniform regulations, a common database (the National Select Agent Registry), and a shared common website (https://selectagents.gov).",
