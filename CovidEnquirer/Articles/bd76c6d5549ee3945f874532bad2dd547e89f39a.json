Overthe-counter (OTC) decongestants, antipyretics, and cough suppressants are usually helpful in controlling symptoms.

In this process, the risks involved in returning to activity (worsening or prolongation of illness) and its affect on performance should be evaluated. A well-known but rare complication of viral URIs is viral myocarditis. Coxsackie virus is perhaps the most common causative viral agent. Although there is no evidence to suggest that exercise during a viral infection increases the likelihood of myocarditis in humans, exertion does increase viral replication rates and severity of morbidity associated with myocarditis in murine models infected with Coxsackie virus [6] . Viral myocarditis has been associated with sudden cardiac death, and accounts for roughly 3% to 5% of known cases in young athletes [7] . The ability of common URI viruses to cause myocarditis and a potential lethal outcome remains a strong reminder of the risks of common viral infections; however, because any sudden death occurrence in a young athlete receives significant publicity, this association may be overvalued, and should not be the sole factor determining return to training activity.",

            "text": "Conflicting evidence exists regarding performance and physiologic markers in individuals who have URIs. Some studies [8, 9] show alterations in cardiac, skeletal muscle, and respiratory function in persons experiencing infectious URIs. Conversely, Weidner et al [10, 11] found no significant change in pulmonary function tests, VO 2 maximum, or duration of cold symptoms during repeated submaximal exercise testing in symptomatic young adults infected with a strain of rhinovirus compared with controls. One distinguishing factor among these data may be the presence or absence of a fever. In Weidner's work, the participants did not have a fever. The finding of fever may signify a more severe infection. Febrile illness results in increased metabolism, caloric, and fluid requirements, and can decrease pulmonary perfusion, concentric muscle strength, and cognitive function [12] . As a result of sparse and conflicting data regarding athletic performance during acute viral URIs, the decision to allow athletic participation can be a difficult one. A regularly cited guideline that may be useful is the so called \"neck check\" [13] . In this scenario, if symptoms are limited to locations above the neck (nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, and the like), the athlete is allowed to perform a 10-minute test period of light exercise. If the athlete feels better or symptoms do not worsen, he or she may continue the workout at a subnormal intensity, with gradual return to full intensity training over subsequent days. If symptoms worsen during the test period, the training session should be ended. If symptoms below the neck or systemic symptoms are present (vomiting, diarrhea, fever, myalgias, lymphadenopathy, and so on) physical exertion should be delayed until these symptoms have resolved [13] . The use of this management approach may help somewhat to objectify return-to-activity decisions. It may also lessen the risk of the athlete developing complications such as viral myocarditis.",

Symptoms that last for longer than 10 days also increase the likelihood of a bacterial infection. In these cases, up to 60% of sinus aspiration cultures are positive for a bacterial pathogen [18] .

There are anecdotal reports of higher incidence of sinus infections in swimmers, and even a term applied to this malady, so-called \"swimmer's sinusitis.\" Leading theories as to etiology of swimmer's sinusitis include the introduction of water into the nasal cavity and sinuses, and cooling of the skin and nasal mucosa during swimming. Scientific support for either theory is sparse. In a single study comparing 20 swimmers and controls, Deitmer and Scheffler [21] found that swimmers report more nasal congestion symptoms and more episodes of sinusitis compared with controls. Ear, nose, and throat (ENT) examination of the same individuals revealed swimmers to have a higher incidence of irritated nasal mucosa and swollen adenoids, but no significant change in function of nasal mucosa. As a result, the authors postulated that cooling of the skin during water immersion may lead to alterations in nasal blood flow and swelling of the nasal mucosa, and ultimately to increased risk of sinusitis [21] .",

Viral pathogens account for approximately 30% of cases of OM. The most common bacterial causes include S pneumoniae, H influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Symptoms of ear fullness or pain, decreased hearing ability, and subjective fever are often present. Otoscopic examination typically reveals a dull, erythematous, nonmobile (with pneumatic otoscopy) tympanic membrane (TM). The TM may sometimes be bulging, and purulent fluid may be visualized in the middle ear. The treatment of OM with oral antibiotics is generally indicated. Analgesics such as acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be used to reduce patient discomfort.",

            "text": "Otitis externa (OE) is an infection involving the external auditory canal. OE occurs when bacterial or fungal organisms are allowed to proliferate in the epithelium of the canal. This often results after a superficial abrasion compromises the integrity of the epidermis, allowing for penetration by pathogens. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most identifiable causative agent of OE. Fungal organisms such as Aspergillus have also been identified [22] . Acute OE is characterized by otalgia, reduced hearing, and aural drainage. Examination is likely to reveal foul-smelling discharge, erythema and edema of the auditory canal, and tragal tenderness. Enlarged preauricular, postauricular, or cervical lymph nodes may also be appreciated. Treatment involves cleansing of the auditory canal and use of topical medications. Cleaning of debris from the canal by irrigation allows for maximum effectiveness of aural preparations. Combination antibiotic/corticosteroid drops (eg, polymyxin B/hydrocortisone) are usually effective. An acidifying/corticosteroid agent (2% acetic acid/hydrocortisone) can be used as an alternative for mild infections. Antifungal medications should be added in cases in which otomycosis is suspected. Use of an ear wick may be needed with each of these treatments to help retain the medications within the auditory canal.",

Recurrent water exposure in these athletes may lead to decreased amounts of cerumen, drying of the ear canal, and resultant itching. Digital manipulation and introduction of cleaning instruments into the canal to alleviate itching often results in abrasions of the epidermis, providing an opportunity for infection to occur [24] . Athletes who have OE should keep the ear dry by staying out of the water during treatment. This may be accomplished by using form-fitting ear plugs as well. Prevention measures include education efforts to eliminate the use of ear cleaning utensils and excessive efforts to remove protective cerumen. Combination drying/acidifying drops such as isopropyl alcohol and acetic acid can also be used as a prophylactic measure.",

The presence of purulent discharge accompanied by conjunctival inflammation is the hallmark of bacterial conjunctivitis. Unfortunately, signs and symptoms are relatively poor prognosticators for differentiating among the different causes of conjunctivitis [26] . The use of empiric antibiotic therapy is therefore controversial. In general, most practitioners opt to treat suspected bacterial conjunctivitis with antibiotics. In this case, using an inexpensive broad-spectrum antibiotic is recommended. Ointments such as erythromycin or bacitracin-polymyxin B may be used in children. Ophthalmic solutions (trimethoprim-polymyxin B) are preferred for adults. Aminoglycosides provide an alternative class of antibiotic therapy and are good choices for suspected gram-negative pathogens.

Enteroviruses are responsible for 55% to 70% of all aseptic meningitic cases and for 85% to 95% of cases for which a pathogen is ultimately identified [52] . Other viral causes include arboviruses, herpesviruses, zoster, adenovirus, HIV, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCM), measles, mumps, rubella, rabies, influenza A and B, parainfluenza virus, parvovirus, and rotavirus. There are multiple nonviral etiologies, including fungal (blastomycosis, coccidomycosis, cryptococcus, histoplasmosis), bacterial etiologies (Mycoplasma, Borrelia burgdorferi, Brucella, Bartonella, Chlamydia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis [TB], Rickettsia species, Leptospira interogans, Listeria monocytogenes), protozoal etiologies, and noninfectious etiologies (medications, collagen vascular disease, malignancy, Reye's syndrome, adrenal leukodystrophy, vaccinations, poisoning, granulomatous disease, toxin exposure, trauma, Kawasaki disease, multiple sclerosis, and inborn errors of metabolism) [51, 52] . The nonviral infectious etiologies are included because they are not easily detected by gram stain and are difficult to culture, often taking weeks to months to grow [52] .",

Obvious signs in the clinical presentation of meningitis include the classic triad of fever, headache, and neck stiffness (meningismus) [51, 52] . This triad is often accompanied by other nonspecific symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, pharyngitis, diarrhea, photophobia, and focal neurologic signs. Symptoms can be accompanied by mental status changes ranging from lethargy to coma [50] [51] [52] . It is important to note that in a clinical series studying bacterial meningitis [51, 53] , only half of patients over the age of 16 presented with the classic triad. Clinical presentation may differ based on the age of the affected individual (neonate to elderly) [52] . Bacterial meningitis can have both a rapidly progressive and fulminant course, or an indolent course consisting of vague symptoms [51] .

The CSF fluid should be sent for cell count, protein, glucose, culture, and gram stain [50, 51, 54] . There is debate whether neuroimaging is needed before lumbar puncture (LP). There is a growing trend to image all patients before LP. Absolute guidelines for neuroimaging include impaired consciousness, deteriorating Glasgow Coma Score, signs of increased intracranial pressure (unstable blood pressure or heart rate, papilledema), and focal neurologic signs [51] . Age-appropriate, empiric, broad-spectrum antibiotics should not be delayed once blood cultures have been obtained if neuroimaging is to be performed [50] [51] [52] . More specific antibiotic coverage is added based on results of CSF Gram stain and culture and condition of the patient [50, 51] . Initially, with viral meningitis or encephalitis, CSF samples usually demonstrate a pleocytosis. White cell counts can range from normal to several hundred cells per mm 3 [51, 52] . Early in the course of the illness, the percentage of polymorphonuclear cells can predominate, but a shift to lymphocytic predominance occurs rapidly [51, 52] . In bacterial meningitis, the white count is usually higher [50, 51] . If the Gram stain does not reveal an etiology, and a monocytosis predominates, viral cultures should be attempted from the original specimen. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies of the CSF can be sent for suspected viral or bacterial etiologies. PCR examination of CSF is especially valuable if herpes simplex virus or enteroviruses are suspected based on seasonal predilection or history [50] [51] [52] Increased red blood cells (RBCs) in the CSF are characteristic of Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection [51] . CSF protein in aseptic meningitis is usually less elevated compared with bacterial meningitis [50, 52] . CSF glucose should be compared with a simultaneous serum glucose. A CSF:serum glucose ratio of 66% is considered normal [50] . In aseptic meningitis, CSF glucose samples are usually within the normal range. Bacterial meningitis will cause a drop in CSF glucose [50, 52] .",

Caliciviruses are by far the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis. Both Norwalk-like and Rotaviruses can cause outbreaks of infection by consumption of contaminated food or water; however, it is very important to recognize the very contagious nature of personto-person spread as well. Caliciviruses can be found not only in feces, but also in vomitus, and have been reported to spread by airborne droplets in nursing homes, hospitals, restaurants, and cruise ships. Both viruses survive well on environmental surfaces and are difficult to deactivate with ordinary cleaning agents (diluted bleach, 1:10 strength). Both require a small inoculum size. These factors make it difficult to control outbreaks in closed populations. Adenoviruses and Astroviruses are less well-studied, but are likely transmitted by person-to-person spread. Adenovirus may have a less contagious nature in adults [58] . Symptoms can include nausea and vomiting and large-volume watery stools (up to 10 or more per day) [61] .",

The most frequent serotype for EHEC is O157:H7 [58, 61] . Its cytotoxin can cause damage to the kidneys and platelets, and cause hemolysis to red blood cells in a condition known as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) [61] .

S enteritis should only be treated in immunocompromised individuals or those who have asplenia (secondary to predisposition to infection with encapsulated organisms) [57, 61] . Antibiotics are not indicated in healthy individuals, because they do not shorten the illness but do prolong the carrier state [57] . Most cases of E coli diarrhea are self-limited. Dysenteric illness should be treated with antibiotics [57] . Shigella manifesting with fever and dysentery should be treated because the antibiotic decreases fever, diarrhea, and excretion of the organism in the stool [57] . Campylobacter treatment is supportive and antibiotic treatment does not appear to improve the gastroenteritis. Early treatment is thought to be effective in eradicating the organism from the stool [57] . Giardia should be treated with antibiotics for comfort and to decrease transmission. Asymptomatic carriers and symptomatic patients who have entamoeba should be treated with antiparacytic medications. In immunocompetent hosts, Cryptosporidium is usually self-limited and does not require antiparacytic treatment [57] . Loperamide (Imodium) should never be used in dysenteric diarrhea [57] for fear of impairing the body's ability to clear the offending pathogen.",

Borrelia is transmitted by the Ixodes tick (deer tick, species specific to locale) [62] [63] [64] . The disease is endemic to the Northeast and North Central states and parts of the upper Midwest (New Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware, New York, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, and Wisconsin), and is spreading to new states [65] . Disease is most prevalent May through August, corresponding to peak human outdoor activity [63, 65] .",

This stage may be characterized by the distinctive rash, erythema chronicum migrans, which occurs in 60% to 80% of cases. Mild systemic symptoms may accompany the rash, including fatigue, myalgias, arthralgias, headache, fever, and chills. Physical examination may reveal stiff neck and regional lymphadenopathy. If not recognized and treated, the skin lesion and symptoms will slowly resolve over 3 to 4 weeks [62, 64, 66] . The earliest manifestation of the second stage, early disseminated disease, can present as multiple secondary annular skin lesions within days to a few weeks after infection. These lesions can occur with the primary erythema chronicum migrans or not at all. If untreated they will resolve over days to weeks [64, 66] . Many patients will not recall a tick bite or an erythema migrans type lesion. These individuals' first indication of disease may come as early stage 2, manifesting as neurologic symptoms in the form of cranial nerve palsies, motor or sensory peripheral neuropathies, and even lymphocytic meningitis. This is followed by weakness and absent reflexes. Untreated, the acute neurologic symptoms will typically resolve within weeks or months [64, 66] . Approximately 6 months after infection, early disseminated disease may manifest as migratory and recurrent arthralgia, with periarticular pain or as frank arthritis of large joints (especially the knee) [63, 64, 66] . Cardiac involvement can present in varying degrees of atrioventricular block (first, second, or third). Unusually, cardiac symptoms can manifest in the form of myocarditis/pericarditis and congestive heart failure [63, 64, 66] . Often conduction defects are asymptomatic; any patient diagnosed with Lyme disease should have a screening electrocardiogram [66] . Stage 3, late Lyme disease, is characterized most commonly by chronic arthritis or neurologic system involvement [63, 64, 66] . They rarely occur concomitantly [66] . The arthritis is usually monoarticular, asymmetric, and confined to large joints (ie, knee). It may recur once or as multiple intermittent episodes over months to years [63, 64, 66] . Severity of the arthritis increases with age [66] . Most often there is no permanent joint damage and the process resolves over the course of several years; [62, 63, 66] ; however, arthropathy or arthralgias may be persistent [66] . Late neurologic disease can manifest in the form of chronic encephalopathy with mild cognitive defects, sensory or motor neuropathies, and even leukoencephalopathies [63, 66] .",

For patients allergic to either of these medications, cefuroxime is the first alternative, followed by erythromycin. Doxycycline carries the advantage of eradication of coinfection with ehrlichiosis. Neurologic disease should be treated with a 2-to 4-week course of parenteral antibiotics in the form of ceftriaxone or cefotaxime. Penicillin G may be a satisfactory alternative. Oral doxycycline is effective for the treatment of Lyme-associated facial palsy [64, 66] ; however, diffuse neurologic disease may be present, and is better treated with parenteral antibiotics. [64] Lyme carditis, manifesting with atrioventricular (AV) node block (PR interval > > >0.3 second) should be treated with intravenous antibiotics and cardiac monitoring. Usually, pacemaker placement is not necessary. For late manifestations of Lyme arthritis, either oral doxycycline or intravenous ceftriaxone are effective [64] .",

In the United States, most infection occurs in the South Atlantic coastal states and the Midwestern states, with the greatest numbers of cases reported in North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Arkansas, South Carolina, Maryland, and Virginia. There is a clear spring-to-summer distribution, with most cases occurring from April to September [67, 68] . The incidence is highest among children, with fatality rates being highest amongst individuals older than 40 and in males [63, 68] . Risk factors include exposure to dogs, residence in a wooded area, and male sex [63] . RMSF remains the most lethal of all the tick-borne disease in the United States, largely because of difficulty in early diagnosis [67, 68] . Infection results in involvement of endothelial and smooth muscle cells of blood vessels of the skin and internal organs, which causes a vasculitis [62, 68] .",

RMSF can present with the triad of rash, fever, and headache; however, the triad in combination with history of tick exposure is reported to occur in only 60% to 70% of confirmed cases [63, 68] . Retrospective studies have indicated that more than half of all patients in the early phases of RMSF were not recognized to be infected. Presentation within 3 days of onset of symptoms is associated with a longer delay in diagnosis than in patients who present after 3 days onset of symptoms [68] . Within 2 to 14 days following a tick bite, the illness will abruptly begin, with a combination of nonspecific symptoms including fever (usually 100% of cases), malaise, severe frontal headache, myalgias, and vomiting with or without abdominal pain [62, 63, 68] . Often the condition is misdiagnosed as gastroenteritis or an acute abdomen [63, 67] . Occasionally the patient may develop hepatosplenomegaly, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, lymphadenopathy, mental confusion, meningismus, encephalitis, respiratory failure, renal dysfunction, coagulopathy, cardiac disturbances in the form of myocarditis or cardiac arrhythmia, and gastrointestinal bleeding during the course of the illness [63] . The rash will typically begin within the first week of infection in the form of blanching 1 to 4 mm macules that later become petechiae. Occasionally, RMSF may be spotless or almost spotless [67, 68] . Classically, the rash forms on the wrists and ankles and spreads centrally [62, 63, 68] ; however, this textbook description is rarely observed. In many cases, the rash begins as a maculopapular exanthema, which then evolves into a petechial rash [68] .",

This disease process was termed human monocytotrophic ehrlichiosis (HME). Later, in a similar illness, Ehrlichia were found in polymorphonucleocytes. This disease was named human granulocytotropic ehrlichiosis (HGE), caused by Ehrlichia phagocytophilia or Ehrlichia ewingii. HME occurs mostly in the South-Central region, the Southeastern and Middle Atlantic states, and California. HGE occurs mainly in the southern New England states, the Middle Atlantic states, the upper Midwest states and Northern California. Vectors in North America for HME include Amblyomma americanum (lone star tick) and Dermacentor variabilis. Vectors for HGE include Ixodes scapularis in the eastern and midwestern United States and Ixodes pacificus in California. Most cases of HME and HGE occur between April and September [69] .",

Urinary dipstick method of diagnosis is frequently used in the diagnosis of UTI because it is cheap, fast, and convenient. Dipstick sensitivity and specificity rise to 75% and 82%, respectively, when nitrite or leukocyte esterase are present [72] . Based on available data, it appears reasonable to empirically treat for UTI when the probability of infection is high, and reserve the above diagnostic tests for when the diagnosis is called into question [77] . A negative test result on dipstick or urinalysis, with a high pretest probability, cannot rule out infection. In this case, it is appropriate to obtain urine culture [72, 77] .

In this scenario, it is estimated that TMP-SMX achieves bacteriologic cure within 7 days in 94% of women [72] . If the patient does not meet the above criteria or is allergic to TMP-SMX, a fluoroquinolone (3 days), nitrofurantonin (7 days), or fosfomycin (single-dose) should be used. For acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis (no signs of systemic toxicity, able to self hydrate, and take oral medications) [72] , fluoroquinolones are the treatment of choice.

If the patient's presentation reveals a short duration of pain with a correlating history and physical examination for torsion, the patient may be more appropriate for surgical exploration rather than delaying treatment for ultrasound examination. Any young male presenting with acute scrotal pain deserves prompt evaluation for testicular torsion. Epididymitis usually presents insidiously with increasing, dull, unilateral scrotal pain [79, 82] . Urinary tract symptoms including dysuria, frequency, and urgency may be present [82] . Once fully developed, the pain can be excruciating [79] and may extend up the spermatic cord and into the lower abdomen [79, 82] . Should infection spread into the testes, swelling and a reactive hydrocele can develop [79, 82] . The physical examination can reveal an erythematous, swollen, and tender epididymis or scrotum, depending on the spread of infection and time to presentation. The patient may be febrile [79, 82] . Urethral milking may reveal urethral discharge [79] . Patients often report relief of pain with elevation of the testicle, known as Prehn's sign. The cremasteric reflex is normally intact. None of these signs are specific for epididymitis, and their presence should warrant further investigation [82] . Urinalysis, urine culture, and urethral culture or urine DNA amplification for gonorrhea and chlamydia should be sent for laboratory evaluation. Urinalysis may reveal pyuria with bacteria present [79, 82] . White blood count may reveal a peripheral leukocytosis with a left shift [79] .",

This also holds true for an adolescent or young man diagnosed with a urinary pathogen as the cause for epididymitis [82] . Patients suspected of having a sexually transmitted cause should be treated with recommended protocols for N gonorrhea and C trachomatis with ceftriaxone 250 mg intramuscularly and doxycycline 100 mg, twice daily for 10 days. For men over the age of 35 years, treatment consists of an oral fluoroquinolone (ofloxacin or levofloxacin) for 10 days [83] . If the epididymitis is severe, parental antibiotics can be used. All sexual partners should also be treated. Symptomatic treatment revolves around inflammatory reduction with scrotal elevation, bed rest, anti-inflammatory agents, and ice.

Recent research has indicated that the prevalence of asymptomatic chlamydia in young adults age 18 to 26 is high. This increased prevalence reveals significant racial and ethnic disparities in both chlamydial and gonococcal infections [86] . The highest rates of chlamydia have been reported in the grouyp 15 to 24 years old. HIV/AIDS infection is the second leading cause of morbidity in the world, and is contracted most commonly by individuals aged 15 to 25. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most widespread sexually transmitted disease in the world. The CDC estimates that 50% to 75% of sexually active men and women acquire HPV at some point in their lives. It has also been estimated that 35% of teens and young adults in various Western countries have acquired HPV. Approximately 20% of the US adult population is infected with HSV, which is a 30% increase in the last 25 years [87] . The staggering reality associated with these statistics is that they belong to the very population that sports medicine specialists spend the majority of their time treating. STDs pose significant morbidity in regards to long-term sequelae of reproductive health in the form of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, tubal infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and continued painful genital lesions, which take significant tolls on physical and psychosexual health. In its severe form, STD can even impact mortality through death [87] .",

Screening in the young adult population makes sense. Studies looking at screening for STDs during preparticipation sports examination found a prevalence in females for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea of 6.5% and 2.0%, respectively; and 2.8% and 0.7% in males, respectively. Of the individuals that were infected, 93.1% had no symptoms [89] .
