While this was originally performed manually (typically by boiling or chemical lysis, that is, the use of noxious organic solvents like phenolechloroform and ethanol precipitation), a wide variety of commercially available instruments have since been developed that automate this process (Fujii et al., 2013) . Automated cell lysis can be achieved through the use of detergents and chaotropic salts, heat, mechanical disruption, or simple pressure. Automated nucleic acid extraction/purification typically employs some variant of solid phase extraction whereby nucleic acids are selectively but reversibly bound to a solid substrate (typically silica), thereby allowing protein and other unwanted cellular components to be washed away, after which the now pure nucleic acids are eluted into an appropriate buffer for downstream applications. Such automated platforms provide faster and more consistent results than manual methods. The use of 96-well, 384-well, and higher density specimen processing formats has also greatly increased specimen throughput, which has led to improved economies of scale.",

Here, the availability of precast gels, capillary arrays connected to gel pumps, and higher-density formats for automated sample loading has helped to increase specimen throughput. However, the process remains somewhat laborious and time-consuming. Advances in alternative technologies for PCR amplicon detection and analysis have sought to circumvent the limitations of electrophoresis-based approaches by detecting target amplicons during the amplification process itself. These approaches employ intercalating compounds, minorgroove binding dyes, and a wide variety of hybridization probes (e.g., molecular beacons and Scorpions \u00d2 ) that can be detected and quantified as they bind to nascent strands of DNA created during each cycle of the PCR process.",

The melt curve of any amplicon is a function of sequencespecific nearest-neighbor thermodynamic interactions. As a result, melt curves serve as \"signatures\" for the presence of an amplified target sequence.

For narrowly tailored and well-optimized PCR assays with clearly defined expected outcomes, interpretation can be a relatively simple and rapid process. For example, PCR-based diagnostic tests for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile, and tuberculosis (TB) are relatively simple, low-multiplexed assays that yield well-defined clinical answers. In sharp contrast to this are PCR-based assays for human identity testing, which may be used for kinship analysis or in forensic DNA crime laboratories. The use of short tandem repeats (STRs) as target genetic markers and the highly variable nature of forensic evidence with regard to sample integrity, DNA quantity, and contributor complexity make data interpretation an especially time-and labor-intensive process, requiring manual review by a skilled laboratory analyst. Efforts to streamline this process have focused on the development of powerful expert systems (computer software that is guided by user-defined rules with the goal of being able to consistently analyze a given set of data with the same skill as a human) (Haned and Gill, 2015) . Expert systems do not replace humans. Rather, they automate tedious and often time-consuming aspects of data analysis to provide analysts with quality scoring of analyzed data and explanations for the reasoning that the program uses to support a specific analytical outcome. See Chapter 21 for a comprehensive discussion of the use of DNA testing for human identity applications.",

Specimens and reagents are usually manually loaded and unloaded from different instruments and transported among different physical locations within a laboratory. At a minimum, these include dedicated pre-PCR (low-template extraction and purification) and a post-PCR (high-template amplification and postamplification analysis) areas of the laboratory. The purpose for this segregation of work areas is to minimize the chance of generating erroneous assay results (the inadvertent introduction of previously amplified nucleic acids into preamplification nucleic acid extracts or preamplification processes). In both a medical diagnostic context and a forensic context, undetected contamination of one specimen with PCR-amplified products from a different specimen could have catastrophic consequences.",

All necessary chemical reagents for the test specimens and some form of internal process control are prepackaged in either a liquid or dried state in disposable assay cassettes or blister packs. Typically, each specimen is processed along its own dedicated pathway, which physically isolates it from other specimens during the entire analytical process. This eliminates the opportunities for potential cross-contamination that exist in traditional segmented workflows. As a result, laboratories are able to bypass many of the burdensome and expensive procedural and infrastructural aspects of contamination control. Most of these systems are lightweight benchtop instruments with small footprints that make them portable and thus well suited to near point-of-care diagnostics, even in lower resource environments.

While certainly not an exhaustive list, these examples encompass the range of general operational principles underlying these systems. Specific details in regard to the individual assay chemistries that run on these systems will be provided in this chapter in the context of specific clinical or identity testing applications. The FilmArray \u00d2 system ( Fig. 5 .1) provides a generic illustration of a fully integrated PCR-based sample-toanswer system. The FilmArray \u00d2 system combines an automated in vitro diagnostic instrument (the base unit) with assay-specific \"pouches\" to detect multiple nucleic acid targets in clinical specimens (Xu et al., 2013) . Each assay pouch is a disposable, self-contained, closed system that contains all the reagents required to extract, amplify, and detect specific nucleic acid targets that may be present in a clinical specimen (Poritz et al., 2011) . The reservoirs in the rigid plastic component (the fitment) of the pouch contain lyophilized reagents. The flexible plastic film portion of the pouch is divided into a series of blister packlike compartments. A series of chemical processes are executed through interactions between the pouch and actuators and sensors in the base unit. These include cell lysis and nucleic acid extraction and purification from the test specimen; first-stage multiplex PCR; and second-stage singleplex PCR and melting analysis, both of which take place in a multiwell array. To run the assay, a technician uses a syringe to load \"Hydration Solution\" into the pouch. This rehydrates the lyophilized reagents that are prepackaged in the pouch fitment. A patient specimen is then mixed with \"Sample Buffer,\" which inactivates RNases in the specimen and which will later facilitate binding of the nucleic acids to the magnetic beads for nucleic acid isolation. A sample loading syringe is then used to transfer the specimen/sample buffer mixture to the pouch. The pouch is then loaded into the base unit.",

Nucleic acid isolation occurs in the first three blister compartments of the pouch. The first step in processing a specimen is to lyse the outer membrane of the target microbes that may be in the patient specimen. This is done using a device called a bead-beater. A sensor in the base unit monitors the speed and operation of the beadbeater and aborts the run if the bead-beater is not working properly. Following bead-beating, the nucleic acids contained in the sample are captured, washed, and eluted by magnetic bead technology. A retractable magnet is used to capture or release the magnetic beads during washes. These steps require about 10 min to complete.

A second-stage PCR (PCR2) control is also included. The PCR2 control detects a DNA target that is dried into wells of the array along with corresponding amplification primers. A positive result indicates the success of the second-stage PCR.",

The GeneXpert \u00d2 system, for example, combines a base unit analyzer with small disposable cartridges (modules) that are barcoded and preloaded with all of the necessary reagents for particular assays (Lawn et al., 2013; Tortoli et al., 2012) . A patient specimen is placed into the cartridge, which is then loaded into the base unit, which reads the cartridge barcode and initiates an assay-specific protocol. Nucleic acid extraction takes place in a processing chamber that contains reagents, filters, and capture technologies necessary to extract, purify, and amplify target nucleic acids. Nucleic acid extraction employs a combination of chemical and ultrasonic lysis, followed by RT-PCR and fluorescent monitoring of multiple channels for target and control signals. Integrated valves are used to facilitate fluid transfer from chamber to chamber, and thin PCR chamber walls enable rapid thermal cycling. The systems software interprets the detected signal and generates a report of the results with a total run time of about 1 h. This system's base units are available with 1-, 2-, 4-, 16-, or 80-module configurations and are equipped with a robotic loading system to minimize hands-on time even in higher volume laboratories. Each module within a base unit operates individually, and as many different assays (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, or C. difficile) as necessary can be run by a technician at the same time. Therefore this system is both flexible and scalable to the needs of the specific laboratory. This is a key advantage relative to the FilmArray \u00d2 system and other systems that process one assay pouch at a time. FilmArray \u00d2 , however, is able to screen for a greater number (up to 20) of target pathogens per pouch.",

Each tube contains all of the reagents necessary to perform an assay. These reagents are arranged in a series of blister pack compartments. Using a transfer pipette, a patient specimen is introduced to the top of the assay tube. After the assay tube is capped, it is inserted into an analyzer base unit, which integrates all nucleic acid testing processes, including reagent preparation, target enrichment, inhibitor removal, nucleic acid extraction, amplification, and real-time detection. Specimen sampling and handling are controlled using multiple sample processing modules contained within the base unit. The specimen processing modules consist of two assemblies. The first is a moving side assembly comprised of multiple sample processing plungers and clamps. The second is a fixed-side assembly. The plungers and clamps selectively compress the Liat \u00d4 assay tube segments against the fixedside assembly so as to selectively release reagents from individual tube blister compartments and move the sample from one compartment to another. The nucleic acid extraction process is based on lysis by chaotropic salts followed by solid phase magnetic particle-based nucleic acid purification. The detection of amplified targets employs fluorogenically labeled hydrolysis probes (e.g., TaqMan \u00d2 probes). As with other integrated systems, an internal positive control is used to confirm the instrument performance and result determination. The internal positive control (IPC) comprises an encapsulated RNA that is prepacked in each Liat \u00d4 tube. The base analyzer unit controls reaction conditions, such as thermal cycling temperatures, in accordance with specific assay programs.

Users are given a choice of two operational modes. In the first mode, a thermocycle-only disk is used, which allows for up to 96 standard real-time PCR assays but requires that patient specimens be extracted separately so that the disk can be loaded with purified DNA. Each of 96 radially inwardoriented inlet wells is connected to one of 96 amplification wells positioned at the outer rim of the disk. Contact heating is employed for thermocycling, and real-time detection can record data in up to four fluorescence channels. In the second mode of operation, a direct amplification disk is used to provide true sample-to-answer functionality. In this second mode, space on the direct amplification disk is occupied mostly by extraction microfluidics, and therefore only eight fully integrated sample processing reactions can be run at a time. The use of the disk requires little hands-on time aside from pipetting 50 mL of reaction mix onto the disk prior to processing a 50-mL patient sample. Samples to be assayed are pipetted into wells near the center of the disk. The technician then enters the assay run parameters and initiates the run. As the disk spins, centrifugal force moves the patient specimens and reaction reagents through the reaction chambers. The direct amplification disk makes use of direct amplification chemistries that can perform nucleic acid extraction and amplification in one protocol. Infrared energy and a high-velocity fan are used to heat and cool the real-time PCR reaction chambers on the disk. Rapid temperature transitions and efficient heat transfers translate into shorter cycle times (as little as 20 s/ cycle). As with the thermocycle-only disk, up to four fluorescence channels are available for target detection, and the system software collects and analyzes the results.

Each disposable test cartridge is designed for the multiplex analysis of a single patient specimen. It features a microfluidic cassette that contains all of the hybridization reagents needed for the assay and captures all of the waste materials that are generated in the process. It also contains a glass slide that serves as a solid support for the microarray where any targeted nucleic acids can be captured for detection. The cartridge processor unit manages the automated nucleic acid extraction, purification, amplification (if required), and hybridization processes. In the test cartridge, genomic DNA is extracted and sheared by sonication into 300 to 500 base pair fragments. This fragment size is easily manipulated and can be readily hybridized to other molecules. The fragmented genomic DNA is allowed to hybridize to a microarray of capture probes that are attached to the glass slide in the assay cartridge. Oligonucleotide probes conjugated to gold nanoparticles are then introduced and allowed to bind to any complementary genomic DNA fragment present on the microarray. Any unbound oligonucleotidegold nanoparticle probes are washed away while elemental silver is deposited onto the gold nanoparticle probes, which are bound and remain. This serves to amply the signal for the optical detection of light scattering from the derivitized gold nanoparticles (Giljohann et al., 2010) . The detection sensitivity that is achieved through the use of gold nanoparticles exceeds that of the fluorescent dye-based detection methods that are employed by most other sample-to-answer systems, so much so that while nucleic acid amplification is an option with the Verigene \u00d2 system, it is not always necessary and can be omitted in some assays. Finally, the cartridge reader images the microarray and analyzes the results from the processed cartridges in order to generate a report. Based on independent evaluations of this system (Butt et al., 2014) , results are typically generated in approximately 2.5 h, making the system competitive with other sample-to-answer systems. The total amount of hands-on time was 21 min. The longer hands-on time was attributed to the need to thaw frozen reagents and move cartridges between the analyzer and the reader.",

The reason for this is that medical diagnostic assays typically need to detect only the presence of an amplified DNA sequence from a targeted microorganism. Human identity testing for kinship analysis or forensic purposes, however, presents the need for identifying specific length variants for each of the STR genetic markers that are targeted for analysis. This necessitates the expansion of basic integrated PCR systems to include a size-fractionation process. In conventional forensic laboratories this is performed using CE. Incorporating this into fully integrated systems has proven to be challenging, but significant progress has been made. Successes have been achieved by interfacing nucleic acid extraction and amplification cartridges with standard CE modules or microfluidic CE. Several parallel efforts have resulted in the commercial availability of fully integrated devices that integrate all of the workflow required for sample-to-profile human identity testing.",

While the assay is intended for use with nasopharyngeal swabs, good sensitivities have also been reported for other types of specimens, including nose and throat swabs, sputum, and specimens collected from the lower respiratory tract (Branche et al., 2014; Ruggiero et al., 2014) .",

Stool culture is the most sensitive test available, but it is laborious, does not detect toxin production, and has a lengthy turnaround time of up to 4 days. Tissue culture cytotoxicity assays require more technical expertise, but they are slightly faster with a turnaround time of up to 2 days. Still, they are less specific and sensitive than PCR or toxigenic culture-based assays. Antigen-detection assays based on latex agglutination or immunochromatography are faster, producing results in under 1 h. Antigen tests, however, are nonspecific for pathogenic strains. Enzyme immunoassays, which are designed to detect C. difficile toxin A, toxin B, or both A and B, are fast and economical but are relatively insensitive.",

There is no FDA-approved FilmArray \u00d2 panel for UTI or STI pathogens, but a first-generation STI panel was designed to detect and identify nine common STI pathogens (C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, Treponema pallidum, T. vaginalis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Haemophilus ducreyi, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, Ureaplasma urealyticum). This panel was used to test 295 clinical specimens from 190 subjects. The STI panel results were compared to results from standard clinical tests performed on duplicate specimens. These included gram staining, wet mount examination, viral culture, and the serum syphilis IgG test. Concordance between the FilmArray \u00d2 STI panel and standard testing was 83% for T. vaginalis, 98% for C. trachomatis, and 97% for N. gonorrhoeae.

Illustrating the potential impact of rapid diagnostic sampleto-answer platforms on public health in a point-of-care context, asymptomatic men were tested on-site at a sexual health clinic using the Xpert \u00d2 CT/NG assay.

Immediate treatment with the antiviral drug acyclovir is indicated for those patients suspected (based on symptomology) of having HSV-associated encephalitis. Left untreated, the mortality rate for these patients approaches 70% (Raschilas et al., 2002) . Ironically, the administration of powerful antiviral drugs to a patient may actually interfere with traditional diagnosis by viral culture, resulting in false negative results. Such adverse effects do not impact PCR-based assays, which makes the detection of HSV using either the FilmArray \u00d2 Meningitis/Encephalitis Panel or the Simplexa \u00d4 HSV 1 & 2 Direct Kit (which is approved for use with CSF specimens) faster and more reliable diagnostic options.",

When used with reference quality buccal swabs, the platform has over an 88% success rate in producing complete profiles (Jovanovich et al., 2015) . When a dilution series of DNA is placed onto swabs and introduced into the platform, full profiles are obtained with 200 ng of DNA, and partial profiles are obtained with as little as 10 ng of input DNA. Buccal swabs analyzed on the RapidHIT \u00d4 200 system have been found to be 100% concordant with profiles generated by traditional laboratory methods, and resultant alleles size within 0.5 bp of corresponding alleles in the allelic ladder, demonstrating acceptable precision (Hennessy et al., 2014) .

Currently, however, FBI policy requires all casework samples to undergo a human-specific quantification step. As this step is not part of the integrated workflow on any sample-to-profile system, casework samples analyzed using rapid DNA systems must still be reanalyzed following a traditional laboratory workflow. This exemplifies how advances in technology can push ahead of existing policy. The more widespread use of sample-to-profile systems for casework samples, therefore, will necessitate a change in official policy, taking into account the technical capabilities of these new platforms.

An important part of making personalized care a reality is the ability to obtain patient test data in a manner that is timelier than that possible using traditional labor-intensive assay methods.

Specifically, advances in microfluidics and microscale automation made it possible to fully integrate, on a handheld scale, the previously segmented processes of nucleic acid extraction and purification, PCR amplification, amplicon detection, and even such complex tasks as electrophoretic size fractionation. With miniaturization also came the ability to reduce processing times so as produce answers more quickly.

The menu of available assays can be expanded to new pathogen panels, drug resistance panels, and assays for genetic markers of human disease predisposition. Cepheid has already moved in this direction with their Xpert \u00d2 FII & FV assay for human gene variants associated with thrombophilia. Of course as infectious pathogens mutate, there will be a need for modified assays, and existing assays can be improved for the use of more patient sample types.

Of course it can be argued that, as with all new technologies, costs will invariably drop as the technology matures. Moreover, since many of these assays target multiple pathogens in a single assay run, the cost per pathogen targeted provides users with a better overall value than if the same series of tests had all been performed on an \u00e0 la carte basis. It also may be worth asking if the ability to easy test for a wide range of pathogens in a simple 1-h test will produce a shift in how physicians think about patient diagnostics. Will multiplex panels reduce the amount of time that physicians would normally spend trying to narrow a preliminary diagnosis to a \"most likely causative agent\" that can be tested for? Will routine testing for pathogens that might not rise to the top of a physician's list of \"most likely suspects\" provide new insights on the complexity of disease processes and ensure more responsive care for those patients whose conditions do not fall within the most probable etiology?",
