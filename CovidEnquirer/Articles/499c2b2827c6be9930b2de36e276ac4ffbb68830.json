            "text": "The management of nasal allergy by pharmacotherapy is a major part of the practice of otolaryngologists and allergists as well as primary care physicians. The use of topical preparations for this purpose has become increasingly popular, as new and better drugs of several types continue to be intr0duced.l Topical cromolyn is used in the treatment of mild to moderate allergic rhinitis, exerting both a protective and therapeutic effect by stabilizing mast cells against degranulation. Corticosteroids have a potent antiinflammatory action and are frequently used to treat moderate to severe rhinitis. Topical corticosteroid use has continued to increase following the introduction of beclomethasone in the 197Os, and new preparations are becoming available with increasing frequency. Other than cromolyn, no mast-cell stabilizers had been introduced until the development of nedocromil. Nedocromil is more potent than cromolyn and combines mast-cell stabilization properties with a broad antiinflammatory action that affects the inflammatory response at several sites. Like cromolyn, nedocromil inhibits both the immediate and late phases of the allergic reaction.",

It stabilizes both mucosal and connective tissue mast cells as well as eosinophils, monocytes, epi- thelial cells, and alveolar macrophages. The mucosal mast-cell stabilizing potency of nedocromil has been determined to be at least 100 times that of cromolyn sodium.' Also, biopsy studies of nasal mucous membrane have shown that treatment with nedocromil sodium significantly inhibits the accumulation of mast cells within the tissue.3 In addition, nedocromil appears to suppress the action or formation of multiple mediators, including histamine, leukotriene C,, and prostaglandin D,.4 Although statistical comparison is difficult, it appears by clinical assessment that nedocromil is significantly more potent for the treatment of allergic rhinitis than cromolyn5",

Nedocromil, like cromolyn, is ineffective in the treatment of p01yps.'~ Other than its application before an anticipated acute allergen exposure, nedocromil cannot be used on an as-needed basis. Rather, to adequately control the symptoms of mild to moderate allergic rhinitis, nedocromil must be used regularly throughout the patient's usual allergic season. However, clinical experience indicates that once effective symptom control has been achieved with the 4 times daily dosage, the maintenance dose may be decreased to a frequency of 2 times daily.",

However, its unique dual action of mast-cell stabilization and antiinflammatory action makes it likely that such use would be appropriate.

It is an antiinflammatory agent that is not a steroid. It is more potent than the currently available mastcell stabilizer, cromolyn, and maintenance therapy may be possible at less frequent intervals than the initially recommended regimen of 4 times daily.
