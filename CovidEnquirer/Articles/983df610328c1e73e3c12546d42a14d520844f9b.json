Materials and Methods: We were collected a total of 460 blood samples from 46 farms with 36 broiler farms and 10 sonali farms (cross-breed) from 2015 to 2017. All the collected serum samples were tested for determining specific antibodies of avian rhinotracheitis (ART) virus, infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) virus, infectious bronchitis (IBV) virus, and Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT) infection using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Results: The overall seropositivity was highest in ORT (45.9%), followed by IBV (37.6%), ART (2.6%), and ILT (0.4%). Out of 360 broiler samples, highest seropositivity was recorded in ORT (43.3%) and lowest in IBV (31.4%). Surprisingly, no broiler samples were found positive for ART and ILT. In case of sonali, the seropositivity was highest in IBV (60%) and lowest in ILT (2%). With respect to types of birds and age groups, the seropositive percentage of all four pathogens was found higher in sonali than broiler. Between two age groups of sonali, the seropositive percentage of ART (12%), ORT (55%), ILT (2%), and IBV (60%) was highest at 21-60 weeks of age compared to 5-20 weeks of age. However, based on location, the seropositive of ORT and IBV was highest in Jamalpur (63.3%) and Fulbariya and Trishal (50%) and lowest in Sreepur (16.7%) and Jamalpur (3.3%). Conclusion: The four pathogens are ubiquitous in nature for the sonali chickens, and the prevalence of ORT and IBV was the most prevalent viruses in the study areas. This study indicates a need for improved surveillance and characterization of ORT and ART circulating in all types of poultry in Bangladesh.",

Various pathogens, such as bacteria, virus, fungus, parasite, etc., are responsible for causing diseases in poultry and they attack their different body systems [3] . Respiratory tract, an important part of poultry body system, frequently affected by pathogens causing respiratory diseases [4] .

ART was first identified in Bangladesh at 2016 by Ali et al. [8] in broiler breeder, layer, and Sonali chicken (cross-breed between Rhode Island Red cocks and Fayoumi hens). Sneezing, depression, coughing tracheal rales, swollen infraorbital sinus, ocular and nasal discharges, and foamy conjunctivitis are the major signs associated with the disease [9] . This virus also causes swollen-head syndrome in broiler breeders and broiler [10] and dropped egg production in layers [11] . ORT, another important bacterial pathogen, belonging to the super family of RNA containing bacteria causes respiratory infections and affects air sac [12] . It has been reported throughout the world except Bangladesh and mainly affect in turkey and chickens but other species can often be infected with this pathogen [13] . This can act as primary or secondary agents depending on immune status, environmental factors, and pathogenicity of related strain and also the presence of other pathogens [14] . ILT virus, an important virus, causes respiratory infection in birds belonging to the family Herpesviridae. Thus, virus mainly affects the chickens and characterizes by sneezing, nasal discharge, swollen infraorbital, and nasal sinuses and sometime affects eye leads to conjunctivitis [15] . The disease more frequently occurs in the areas of intensive poultry production and outbreak causes' high economic loss as it increases mortality, reduces egg production, and declines growth rates [16] . Another important viral pathogens responsible for respiratory disease, namely, Avian IBV belonging to the genus Gammacoronavirus of the Coronaviridae family [17] . It can affect chickens of all ages, and primarily it replicates in respiratory tract, and later, it can move to epithelial cells gut, oviduct, and kidney, results decreased egg production and growth performance and sometimes attract other pathogens [18] . So far, it has been reported in chickens, turkey, pigeon, pheasant, Guinea fowl, and peafowl [17] .",

All the sonali blood samples (100) were collected from ten farms of Bogura sadar upazilas of Bogura district, and each farm shared 10 samples. All the selected broiler and sonali farms had a history of respiratory problems and had not been vaccinated against the studied pathogens.

Commercially available ELISA kits (BioChek\u00ae, Reeuwijk, Netherlands) of ART, ORT, ILT, and IBV were used to detect the antibodies. Serum samples were diluted at 1:50 dilution in dilution buffer, followed by 1:10 dilution, and final dilution of 1:500 was used as working samples for respective ELISA. 100 \u03bcl of negative and positive controls was added into antibody coated plate wells A1, B1 and C1, D1, respectively, remaining 92 wells were filled with samples. After that, plate incubated at room temperature for 30 min in case of IBV and 60 min in case of ART, ORT, and ILT. Meanwhile, conjugate and wash solutions were prepared according to manufacturer's instructions. After incubation, contents of wells were aspirated and washed four times with wash buffer (350 \u03bcl). Then, the plate was inverted and tapped firmly on absorbent paper to remove the moisture. Then, 100 \u03bcl conjugate reagents were added on each well. Again, the plate was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in case of IBV and 60 min in case of ART, ORT, and ILT, respectively. After incubation, washed the plate with wash buffer following the procedure described previously. Then, the wells of microtiter plate were filled with substrate and incubated for 15 min at 22\u00b0C-27\u00b0C in case of IBV and 30 min for ART, ORT, and ILT. After incubation, the reaction was stopped by adding 100 \u03bcl stop solutions. Finally, the optical density value of each sample was measured at 405 nm within 15 min after adding stop solution, and the results were recorded by calculating sample to positive (S/P) ratio and antibody titer.",

The results showed that overall seropositive percentage of ART, ORT, ILT, and IBV viruses was 2.6%, 45.9%, 0.4%, and 37.6%, respectively. Compared to broiler, the seropositive was found more in sonali chicken. Interestingly, no samples were found positive against ART virus in case of broiler but 12% were recorded in sonali birds. The past seroprevalence study of ART in Bangladesh found overall 53.29% chickens including 35.57% sonali and 50.85% layer chickens [8] . On the contrary, Sharma et al. [24] found the higher number of ART positive sample 31.7% in broiler flocks in Grenada, West Indies. A higher rate of seropositivity in the later study was observed as this area had the highest density of broiler flocks. Detection of ART antibodies, which is also known as APV, in broiler was negative compared to sonali birds (0% vs. 12%), this higher positive results in sonali to broiler might be due to the life span, that longer life span may allow the sonali birds to develop stronger immunity against the virus detected [24] . In Egypt, similar study was carried out by Nagy et al. [10] reported 21.7% ART seropositive broiler samples. Another reason of lower seropositive in this study may be due to the fact that infected chicken may not necessarily produce humoral antibodies or antibodies may be at very low levels at the time of the sampling [25] . In this study, the seropositive percentage of ORT was higher in both broiler and sonali birds (43.3% and 55%), which is in agreement with the results of Mehrabanpour et al. [13] who has reported 42.5% seropositivity of ORT in broiler chickens in Fars province, Iran and also in agreement with the findings of Ghanbarpour and Salehi [26] for large broiler flock who reported 42.9% seropositivity of ORT in Kermanshah province, west Iran. In addition, comparatively higher or lower seropositivity of ORT in broiler was reported in different parts of the world [12, 27] . The difference among different studies might be due to variation in geo-climatic condition, age and exposure of weather which might contribute to variable prevalence of respiratory diseases [13] .",

In Bangladesh, infectious bronchitis causes a great deal of economic losses through poor weight gain and production drop. High seropositive was found for ORT that indicates ubiquitous presence of the organism in study areas. As there is no vaccination practiced for ORT, it indicates that a larger portion of poultry flock is experiencing new field infection. Further investigation could be done to know the molecular characteristics and surveillance of the four respiratory diseases.",
