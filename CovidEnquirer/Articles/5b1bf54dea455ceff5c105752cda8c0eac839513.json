This review describes their major functions involved in antitumor, anti-virus, and anti-inflammatory bioactivities. Due to their enormous structural heterogeneity, the approaches for isolation and purification of polysaccharides are distinct from that of the other macromolecules such as proteins, etc. Yet, to achieve the homogeneity is the initial step for studies of polysaccharide structure, pharmacology, and its structure-activity relationships. According to the experiences accumulated by our lab and the published literatures, this review also introduces the methods widely used in isolation and purification of polysaccharides.",

            "text": "More and more studies show that polysaccharides possess complex biological activities and a variety of functions, especially effects on organism immune function. It can be said that most of the bioactivities and functions of polysaccharides are related to the immune system [7] . Although the research on polysaccharides started later than three other classes of life macromolecules (i.e. proteins, nucleic acids and lipids), polysaccharides have aroused more and more interests from people because their important physiological functions and wide applications are being continuously explored in life processes. At present, polysaccharides have become an important constituent part in the research and development of natural drugs and healthcare products. According to incomplete statistics, at least 30 polysaccharides are being carried out standard clinical trials involved in antitumor, anti-virus, diabetes therapy and so on in the world, respectively [8] . The global sales of carbohydrate drugs and healthcare products have exceeded US$ 19.3 billion in 2002 [9] . It is clear that the sleeping giant of carbohydrate is awakening. It is said that the research of structure and function of polysaccharides has become the third milestone in exploring the mystery of life after the study of proteins and nucleic acids. Now on one hand, the advanced biochemical instruments and biotechnology are used to search more effective polysaccharides and their derivatives from traditional medicine, microorganism, and marine organism to conquer diseases such as tumor in many countries. On the other hand, the research is focused on the structure-activity relationship and action mechanism of polysaccharides. Up to now, \u2424-glucans from higher fungi (especially mushrooms), pectins from some plants, and sulfated polysaccharides from marine algae have been intensively studied among polysaccharides from natural products.

Most of the polysaccharides do not directly act on tumor cells, but play a role by activating the immune system of an organism: i.e. promoting the maturation, differentiation and reproduction of three kinds of cells (lymphocytes, macrophages and natural killer cells) [13] ; simultaneously activating complements and the endothelial system on the endoplasmic reticulum; promoting the generation of a variety of cytokines [14] ; and ultimately inhibiting the growth of tumor cells or causing the apoptosis of tumor cells. A lot of polysaccharides possessing antitumor activity have already been found so far, such as \u2424-glucans which have different planar and three-dimensional structure, pectic polysaccharides, and seaweed polysaccharides. Some polysaccharides, like lentinan [15, 16] , polysaccharide from Ganoderma lucidum [17, 18] , polysaccharide from Coriolus versicolor [19] and so on have been formally used in clinic and favored by doctors. Other polysaccharides which are being researched further include Bergenia crassifolia pectin polysaccharide [20] , Phellinus linteus polysaccharide [21] , Grifola frondosa polysaccharide [22] , Panax ginseng polysaccharide [23] , Agaricus blazei polysaccharide [24] , Antrodia cinnamomea polysaccharide [25] , lycium barbarum polysaccharide [26] , acetobacter polysaccharide [27] and so on [28, 29] . It is necessary to note that besides \u2424-glucans, some \u2423-glucans also possess activity [29, 30] .",

Studies indicated that most of antiviral polysaccharides can interfere the binding of virus surface glycoprotein gp120 to CD4 receptor on the lymphocyte surface [35] , and can inhibit the expression of viral antigen, and inhibit the activity of viral reverse transcriptase (RT) [36, 37] . The chemical structures of polysaccharides with antiviral activity mostly contain sulfate radical. The existence and amount of sulfate radical in the polysaccharide directly affect its antiviral activity. For example, lentinan from Lentinus edodes (Berk) has a remarkable anti-tumor effect, whereas its anti-HIV activity is very low. However, sulfated lentinan possesses a significant anti-HIV activity. Similarly, the polysaccharide from sargassum has anti-tumor effect and the sulfated sargassum polysaccharide possesses an obvious anti-herpes virus activity [38] . Many polysaccharides have been reported to possess antiviral activity so far, such as a sulfated galactan having anti-herpes virus activity isolated from red algae in the sea [39, 40] , a sulfated fucosan obtained from arabic gum, and a sulfated xylan from green algae etc. They all can selectively inhibit the formation of herpes simplex virus and syncytium [41] . The sulfated K5 Escherichia coli polysaccharide possesses the anti-HIV activity and its structure is similar to heparin, but it has no anticoagulant effect like heparin. This polysaccharide is expected to be developed a candidate drug to prevent HIV transmission in developing countries [42, 43] .",

Studies indicated that although some polysaccharides do not increase the insulin secretion in the body, they can significantly improve the activity of glucokinase, hexokinase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) in liver, also reduce the level of triglyceride and cholesterol in plasma [45] . Some polysaccharides are \u2424-receptor agonists. They can pass information to mitochondria through the second messenger, which can speed up the glucose oxidation and finally result in the hypoglycemic effect [46] .

In general, polysaccharides are hydrophilic macromolecules. The methodologies of isolation and purification of polysaccharides are different from small molecules.

So the first step of extracting polysaccharides is to crush materials of animal/plant to make intracellular polysaccharides release easily. Besides traditional crushing methods, ultrasonic gas flow crushing technology is used to rupture the cell wall of animal/plant or fungal spores in recent years, thus greatly increasing the efficiency of polysaccharide extraction. Due to cell walls of animal/plant are largely surrounded by lipid, removal of lipid has to be done after mechanical crushing. The common method for removing lipid is ethanol reflux 6-8 h using Soxhlet extractor [81] . The raw material after removal of lipids can be used to extract polysaccharides. There are a lot of methods of polysaccharide extraction, among which four methods are frequently used.",

The dialysis duration is not longer than 36 h usually, otherwise the dialysis bag easily gets moldy without preservatives. Since dialysis bags have different specifications of MW cut-off (MWCO), the first step is to select an appropriate dialysis bag of MWCO for dialysis. Dialysis bags need to be pretreated before use. They are usually put in boiling water and boiled for around 0.5 h to remove impurities in them before use. Dialysis bags can be used repeatedly, but they must be washed clean after use, soaked in the water with a little preservative (such as benzoic acid), and stored in the refrigerator (take note to avoid dryness and molding). In general, dialysis bags are stable in the pH of 5-9, hence the extract solution of polysaccharide should be adjusted to pH 5-9 first before dialysis. It should be noted that although dialysis bags have certain exclusion range of MW, some polysaccharide molecules are linear therefore sometimes polysaccharide molecules exceeding exclusion range may also pass through the dialysis bag [84] . In addition, ion exchange resins are also used to remove inorganic salts (charged anions and cations). For removal of salts in a large industrial scale, mixed beds of ion exchange resin can be applied.",

The resulting mixture was adjusted to pH 7.0 using acetic acid, concentrated and precipitated by ethanol to obtain the decolorized polysaccharides [80, 81] . It is essential to strictly control decolorizing conditions when using H 2 O 2 method, e.g. the concentration of crude polysaccharide solution, temperature, time, pH, etc. Even so, this method still can result in some loss of polysaccharide degradation. Fang et al. [85] invented a novel method of polysaccharide decolorization, which used a kind of reverse micellar solution composed of n-hexanol-CTAB (cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide)-isooctane to decolorize polysaccharide. This method which has been granted a patent is convenient and rapid. Meanwhile the recovery of polysaccharide is high.",

Larger MW polysaccharides have less solubility than smaller MW ones in ethanol or acetone, so gradually increasing the concentration of ethanol or acetone can precipitate different MW polysaccharides respectively [81] . It is often carried out as follows: High concentration or anhydrous ethanol is slowly added to the solution of polysaccharide mixture when stirring to make the final concentration of ethanol reach 25% (v/v). After adding ethanol, the solution is placed for 2 h, and then centrifuged to get the supernatant and precipitate (can be designated as \"1st precipitate\"). The precipitate is high MW polysaccharide fractions. Ethanol is continued to slowly add to the supernatant when stirring to make the final concentration of ethanol reach 35% (v/v). The solution is placed for 2 h and then centrifuged to obtain the supernatant and precipitate (can be designated as \"2nd precipitate\"). The 2nd precipitate is also polysaccharide fractions, but its MW is lower than the 1st precipitate. The process of graded precipitation can proceed further, which depends on the practical case. The key of graded precipitation is to try to avoid co-precipitation to happen. In practical terms, the concentration of the ploysaccharide mixtures can not be too high, the speed of ethanol adding can not be too fast, and the pH of the solution should be around neutral. The result of purfication is better when the concentration of the polysaccharide solution is smaller and the co-precipitate effect is weaker. But if the polysaccharide concentration is too thin, the recovery of polysaccharide will decrease and the consumption of ethanol will greatly increase. In general, the concentration of polysaccharide in the mixture is adjusted to 0.25% (w/v)-3% (w/v) before using this method [79] . Graded precipitation method is often firstly used in the research and development of polysaccharide healthcare products as it is much easier than column chromatography method.",

So this polysaccharide fraction and supernatant can be obtained respectively through centrifugation. Continue to add this salt to the obtained supernatant, thus another polysaccharide fraction will precipitate out. Salting-out method is widely used in protein purification. In early stage, the purification of PSK (Polysaccharide Krestin) used this method. The salting-out method is cost-effective, low-efficiency and easy to form co-precipitation [80] . The key factor of affecting the efficiency of salting-out method is the concentration of polysaccharide. The purfication result is better when the concentration of the polysaccharide solution is smaller. The secondary factors are pH value of the solution and salting-out temperature. In order to obtain a satisfactory experimental repeatability, the concentration and pH and temperature of the solution should be all controlled strictly. There are a lot of salting-out agents to be used in practice. Although neutral inorganic salts are all used as salting-out agents, (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 is most widely used in polysaccharide purification.

The coordination compounds can not dissolve in the aqueous solution of low ionic strength. According to this property, the coordination compound of quaternary ammonium salt-polysaccharide can be generated in the form of precipitate, then the coordination compound precipitate can be gradually dissociated and eventually dissolved by slowly increasing the ionic strength of the solution to a certain extent. This method is often applied in the separation of acidic polysaccharides and neutral high-MW polysaccharides. The quaternary ammonium salts commonly used are CTAB (cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide) and CPC (cetylpyridinium chloride) [87, 88] . In the experiment operation, besides controlling the ionic strength of solution, the pH value of solution also must be controlled. The pH value of solution should be less than 9.0 and no sodium tetraborate is present in the solution, otherwise neutral polysaccharides can also precipitate. The quaternary ammonium salt precipitation method has a very good effect. It can precipitate acidic polysaccharides or long chain macropolysaccharides from a very dilute solution (e.g. 0.01% concentration) via selective precipitation. The coordination compounds formed have different solubility in salt solutions with different ionic strength, acid solutions and organic solvents, through which combined polysaccharides can be freed. The coordination compound formed is often dissolved in NaCl solution of 3-4 mol/L, then polysaccharides will be precipitated by adding 3-5 times ethanol and the quaternary ammonium salt still stays in the solution; or the coordination compound formed is dissolved in NaCl solution of 3-4 mol/L, then the quaternary ammonium salt will be precipitated by adding iodide or thiocyanate and the polysaccharides still stay in the solution. n-butanol, pentanol or chloroform and other organic solvents are also used to extract the quaternary ammonium salt-coordination compound solution. Finally, salts are removed by dialysis and the solutions are freeze-dried to obtain the pure polysaccharides. The quaternary ammonium salt precipitation method is a classical method and it is still used in the polysaccharide purification up to now, such as lentinan was once purified using this method in Japan.",

The separation mechanism of anion exchange column chromatography is not only ion-exchange, but also adsorption-desorption. So anion exchange column chromatography can be used in the separation of neutral and acidic polysaccharides, and the separation of different neutral polysaccharides as well. In general, when the pH value is 6.0, acidic polysaccharide can be adsorbed to the exchanger whereas neutral polysaccharide can not be adsorbed [79] [80] [81] [82] . Then the buffers which have same pH value and different ionic strength can be used to elute these acidic polysaccharides out respectively. The ability of polysaccharide to adsorb exchanger is related to polysaccharide structure. The adsorb ability usually increases with the increase of acidic groups in polysaccharide molecules. For linear molecules, larger MW neutral polysaccharide is easier to be adsorbed compared to smaller MW polysaccharide. The adsorb ability of straight chain polysaccharide is greater than that of branched chain polysaccharide. In most cases, 100 g of DEAE-cellulose can load 0.5-1.5 g of dry polysaccharide sample. The elution mode is usually to use buffers with different ionic strength to carry out gradient elution or stepwise elution. In addition, neutral polysaccharide can also form coordination compound with borax (sodium tetraborate) [86] . Based on this, DEAE-cellulose is sometimes processed into borax-type DEAE-cellulose. When the polysaccharide solution flows through the borax-type DEAE-cellulose column, polysaccharide will coordinate with borax and adsorb on the column. Then the column is eluted using borate solution of different concentrations. The eluate which flows out first is the polysaccharide fraction that does not coordinate with borax, and the eluate flowing out last is the polysaccharide fraction that coordinates with borax most strongly.",

Affinity chromatography. Some specific polysaccharides can reversibly bind with certain specific molecules. For example, a kind of lectin (concanavalin) can specially bind with some branched polysaccharides. This binding ability between specific molecules can be called affinity. The two specific molecules can also dissociate after they bind. Using this property, polysaccharides can get purified through the process of binding-dissociation. The process is described simply as below: an affinity column should be prepared in advance. The affinity column is eluted using the polysaccharide solution as mobile phase. The polysaccharide solution is a mixture of polysaccharide fractions. During the elution process, only the polysaccharide fraction that can bind with the ligand would be combined and adsorbed to the column, and other polysaccharide fractions that can not bind with the ligand would flow out of the column. Then the ionic strength and pH value of the mobile phase can be properly changed to dissociate the polysaccharide fraction combined with the ligand. So finally the purified polysaccharide fraction can be obtained [81, 89] . The advantage of affinity chromatography is high efficiency and easy-to-operate. Especially for separation of the low-content polysaccharide, the concentration rate can reach several hundred even several thousand using affinity chromatography only one time. However, the disadvantage is that it is difficult to find a proper ligand for a given polysaccharide molecule. Therefore, affinity chromatography is seldom applied in the polysaccharide purification.",

The high MW polysaccharides can be separated at a low speed, while the low MW polysaccharides can be separated at a high speed. This method is seldom used in polysaccharide separation. The density gradient zonal centrifugation method is often used in polysaccharide research, especially for the determination of polysaccharide homogeneity. The rationale of this method is that when polysaccharides are centrifuged in the inert gradient media and reach an equilibrium, different MW polysaccharides can be gathered and distributed to certain specific positions within gradient and form different zones, then these zones are to be separated so different polysaccharide fractions can be obtained. The commonly used inert media are water, NaCl solution and CsCl solution etc. The centrifugal speed is generally set up to 60,000 rpm or so. The density gradient zonal centrifugation method for polysaccharides is often used before 1980's and mostly performed for semi-micro preparation of polysaccharide.",

This method is called ultrafiltration method. In fact, the principle of ultrafiltration method is also molecular sieve. In theory, it is feasible to use this method to separate and purify polysaccharides. But in practical operation, there are some problems [31] . Most ultrafiltration membranes can adsorb polysaccharides, which leads to the biggish decrease of polysaccharide yield. For example, hollow fiber ultrafiltration membrane can greatly adsorb polysaccharides. In addition, the ultrafiltration speed is much low and the time-consuming is too long because many polysaccharide solutions are very viscous. Even the polysaccharides can go bad during the long ultrafiltration processing period. Furthermore, the shape of most polysaccharide molecules is not spherical. If the shape of polysaccharide is linear, polysaccharides also can pass through the membrane when their MW exceed cut-off of membrane.",

            "text": "Different polysaccharides can be separated under the action of electrical field according to their MW, shape and charges. The carrier is commonly glass powder. Operations are usually like this: use water to slurry glass powder, pack a column, and use electrophoresis buffer (e.g. 0.05 mol/L borax solution, pH 9.3) to equilibrate the column for 3 days. Then load the polysaccharide sample on the upper end of column and switch on electric current. The upper end is positive pole. Due to electro-osmosis, polysaccharide molecules generally shift to negative pole in electrophoresis. A great deal of heat is generated in the electrophoresis process, so this kind of column must be equipped with jacket cooling. The commonly used voltage is about 1.2-2.0 V/cm, current is 30-35 mA, and the electrophoresis time is 5-12 h. After electrophoresis, the glass powder carrier is pulled out from the column and segmented. The segmented parts can be eluted with water or dilute alkaline solution respectively. This method has a good separation effect. Meanwhile, the time-consuming is long and the purification capacity each time is small. So this method is suitable for semi-micro preparation in lab [79, 81] .",
