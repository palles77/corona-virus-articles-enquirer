            "text": "The diagnosis of any infectious disease requires active communication between clinicians and clinical laboratory personnel, usually in the form of \"consultations\" from clinicians to the laboratory director \"on call\" or directly with the laboratory technologists. Arriving at a correct diagnosis in a timely fashion begins with the acquisition of an adequate clinical specimen (blood, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, respiratory secretions, bronchoalveolar lavage, feces, etc.) and its transportation to the laboratory in an appropriate container. Specimens for molecular diagnostic tests sometimes require different methods of transportation/ preservation from those of regular specimens so as to ensure that the techniques, used efficiently, will detect the suspected infectious agent. The classic diagnostic principles in clinical medicine still apply when using molecular methods of diagnosis. Patients and populations are evaluated clinically and epidemiologically, and case definitions are created so that test parameters, such as sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values, can be defined. Likewise, understanding the concept of screening versus confirmatory testing is also important. The three major steps performed in molecular assays are specimen processing, nucleic acid amplification or hybridization, and product detection (Nolte and Caliendo, 2007; Persing et al., 2004) . Processing of the specimen is one of the most important steps for the successful detection of nucleic acids. Protocols vary, depending on the specimen received, and the specimen \"matrix\" plays an important role in nucleic acid extraction, owing to the presence of extraneous material in some matrices, that could potentially interfere with the molecular assays being performed. The most widely known example of such interference is the presence of Taq polymerase inhibitors in nucleic acid extracts, leading to false-negative results. Nucleic acid extraction protocols are usually cumbersome, and automation has been relatively challenging. However, several instruments have been designed for the clinical laboratory in which automated extraction protocols have been incorporated. Automation has also been incorporated for nucleic acid amplification methods, including conventional and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), branched DNA, and isothermal technologies that obviate the usual thermal cycling and potentially speed up the time required for amplification. Automated platforms, however, have decreased the cycling time by changing more quickly the temperatures required for different PCR cycles. Real-time PCR systems are usually coupled with automated detection systems that also vary in complexity. A few instruments are also capable of complete automation, including extraction, nucleic acid amplification, and detection systems. Tables 7.1 and 7.2 present a summary of the techniques available for the detection of nucleic acids from infectious agents. ",

One of these technologies, commonly referred to as real-time PCR, has gained considerable popularity. This method combines nucleic acid amplification and fluorescent detection of the amplified product in the same closed system (Morse, 1995; Relman et al., 1990; Hjelle et al., 1994; Aragon et al., 2006) . The promulgation of real-time PCR as an important testing platform in clinical microbiology was catapulted by US homeland security efforts to produce rapid, reliable testing methods for identifying potential agents of bioterrorism. The Laboratory Response Network (LRN), an integrated group of public health, armed forces, and private referral laboratories, was created by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to serve as a reference laboratory network for identifying and confirming agents of bioterrorism. In a very short period, scientists at CDC successfully developed a number of realtime PCR assays for the detection of agents of bioterrorism, and these assays are now available at many of the LRN laboratories.",

In addition, conventional diagnostic tests for infectious agents are slow, sensitive, expensive, or unavailable. Therefore since 1990 the identification of several pathogens has been obtained with molecular techniques that have contributed primarily to the diagnosis of these infectious agents Relman, 1998) . Nucleic acid\u00c0based assays are now gold standards for several infectious agents, including hepatitis C virus (HCV), enterovirus, Bordetella pertussis, and herpes simplex virus (HSV) (in the context of herpes encephalitis, Chlamydia trachomatis, and others). Cost-effectiveness is undoubtedly an extremely important factor when introducing molecular diagnostics into the clinical laboratory to replace conventional techniques. The best example is that of common bacterial pathogens, some of which require, in addition to identification, sensitivity tests to guide clinicians in choosing the most effective antibiotic.",

Another complicating feature is that some recipients of the smallpox vaccine may develop erythema multiforme, which can also present as vesicular lesions. It has been our experience that by using real-time PCR assays, one can rapidly discriminate among these possibilities. Analyte specific reagents (ASRs) or kits for the detection of HSV or VZV with the LightCycler instrument are available from at least two vendors [RealArt HSV 1/2 kit and RealArt VZV PCR kit (Artus); LightCycler Herpes Simplex Virus 1/2 and LightCycler VZV ORF29 (Roche Diagnostics Corporation)].

Researchers have used the assays with the Roche LightCycler instrument to routinely detect HSV and VZV and have developed an in-house realtime PCR assay for poxviruses, including variola virus that uses the LightCycler instrument. These assays have been invaluable for providing a rapid result, especially for military personnel who have developed cutaneous vesicular lesions as a complication of receiving the smallpox vaccine and who have been on assignment in areas of the world at significant risk for bioterrorism events. Importantly, the home-brewed real-time assay that they have developed can discriminate among several poxviruses and was useful in the identification of viremia in a recent case of monkey poxvirus disease in a patient from the Upper Midwest.

Similarly, modern typing methods, based on direct data, such as sequencing and powerful software, to analyze gene clusters and genetic evolution, have also made it possible to detect possible epidemics by new pathogens or reemerging agents (Sintchenko and Gallego, 2009) . Typical examples include surveillance systems for influenza A viruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome. Powerful molecular techniques cannot be used in isolation. Modern biomonitoring systems are important elements, including traditional epidemiological tools and newly developed \"computer-based\" systems in which complete integration of microbial profiling is merged with epidemiological surveillance and spatial surveillance (depending on the use of systems geographical information).

Increasing evidence indicates that cell free miRNAs are present in body fluids including blood and saliva. They are produced endogenously in response to the molecular change in cells, and therefore they can be used as diagnostic reporters for various diseases such as cancer and viral infections (Zhu et al., 2014) . MiRNA is a class of small (18\u00c024 nucleotides in length) noncoding RNAs, which involves in gene regulation and plays important roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis (Kaladhar, 2015) . From the previous reports, miRNAs have distinct expression profiles in virus-infected cells in comparison to their healthy counterparts (Tambyah et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2014) . Moreover, the expression levels of many miRNAs in virus-infected samples and normal controls exhibit fold change difference (Song et al., 2010) .",

In vitro studies show miRNA target influenza; vesicular stomatitis virus, human T-cell leukemia virus 1; human papillomavirus; and enterovirus 71, and they inhibit viral replication (Fig. 7.3) , which facilitates the clearance or potentiating viral latency of the pathogen (Bai and Nicot, 2015; Hen et al., 2014; Zheng et al., 2013) . MiRNAs were also essential to show malaria transcripts translocation into the parasite (150). Indeed, due to their targeting of viral transcripts, miRNAs have the potential to partially dictate the cell tropism of a virus, the resistance of resting T-cells to human T-cell leukemia virus appears to be due to their expression of mir-28-3p RNA polymerase II produces a 500\u00c03000 nucleotide transcript, called pri-miRNA, that is mature to pre-miRNA hairpin by a DROSHA (_60\u00c0100 nucleotides). This double-stranded hairpin structure is exported from the nucleus into cytoplasm by exportin 5 (RAN GTPase). Lastly, the pre-miRNA is processed by DICER1 and produces sense and antisense strands, approximately 20 nucleotides in length, the effective strand called antisense and known as mature miRNA and short-lived complementary sequence called passenger strand (miR*). The antisense-stranded miRNA is combined into RISC, which then targets it to the target 30 untranslated region mRNA sequence to facilitate repression and cleavage. AA, Poly A tail; m7G, 7-methylguanosine cap; miRNAs, microRNA; ORF, open reading frame; RNA, ribonucleic acid. (Bai and Nicot, 2015) . Although a few scientists agree on the direct interaction between miRNAs and viral transcripts, Bogerd et al. (2014) argue that cellular miRNAs do not target viruses as global downregulation of host cell miRNAs (via DICER knockout) does not lead to the enhancement of 11 viruses in human embryonic kidney cell line 293T. However, Bogerd et al.'s model is problematic as viruses may be dependent on cell mechanisms that are controlled by miRNAs, and the usual host cell of the viruses in their study is not human embryonic kidney cells. Contrary to Bogerd et al.'s study, there is evidence that direct targeting of viral genome/transcripts occurs in vivo as several groups have successfully attenuated viral vaccines by incorporating human miRNA seed sites in viral genome (see The Clinical Applications of miRNAs: Improving Vaccines) (Barnes et al., 2008) . The relative importance of miRNA direct targeting of viruses in innate immunity remains to be seen however as in vivo and in vitro studies show viral mutation of miRNA seed sites in viral genomes means viruses can quickly evolve to avoid being targeted by miRNAs (Zheng et al., 2013; Heiss et al., 2012) .",

Their biological function is debated since their secretion may be activated as intercellular communicators of gene regulation, or as cellular waste disposal method, or passively secreted as a by-product of cell death (Turchinovich and Cho, 2014) . Although these three theories can be valid, there is increasing evidence that ex-miRNAs are functional, can be passed between leukocytes in vitro and in vivo, and play a role in disease (Alexander et al., 2015; Bell and Taylor, 2017; Lehmann et al., 2012; Mittelbrunn et al., 2011) . Regardless of their functions, one clinical application of ex-miRNA is the use of these as biomarkers of infectious disease. Furthermore, these miRNAs have shown the potential to be used as a biomarker for the prognosis and therapy of infectious diseases. miRNAs have also shown a significantly altered expression during infection. The altered expression of miRNA level in an infected human can be identified by the use of advanced diagnostic tools. In addition to their availability in numerous body fluids, miRNAs are highly stable in these fluids. These features make miRNAs, in single or in a combination (Peng et al., 2016) , ideally suited as biomarkers for disease diagnosis.",

Given there is good evidence that miRNA contained in exosomes is functionally secreted as intercellular mediators of gene regulation, it is tempting to speculate that biomarker studies which profile miRNAs in exosomes rather than ex-miRNA in total plasma/serum (which will include a background of miRNA present from dead cells) could be more sensitive or specific biomarkers; comparisons of different extraction methods within the same biomarker study could help resolve this possibility.",
