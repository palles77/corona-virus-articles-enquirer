            "text": "In human and other eukaryotic cells, high-mannose-type glycans (HMGs) appear in the early-stage N-glycosylation of nascent polypeptides within the endoplasmic reticulum. These \"immature\" oligosaccharides are subsequently processed into hybrid and complex glycoforms during protein secretion through the Golgi apparatus before they reach the cell membrane. Hence, HMGs are rarely found in the extracellular environment under normal conditions. 1,2 However, it is widely known that the envelope (Env) glycoproteins of HIV are heavily glycosylated with HMGs. While these glycans generally serve as a shield to protect neutralization-sensitive, conserved Env regions from humoral immune attack, recent studies have revealed that a fraction of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) can evolve to target this HMG shield in some HIV-infected individuals, providing implications for HIV vaccine development. [3] [4] [5] Carbohydrate-binding proteins, or lectins, are widely found in animals, plants, and microorganisms, playing critical roles in diverse biological processes, including cellular signaling, microbe-host interactions, and host defense. 6, 7 Lectins are utilized in many biological applications, including cell profiling, lectin microarrays, affinity chromatography using immobilized lectins, histochemistry and cytochemistry, medical diagnosis as biosensors, and environmental monitoring. 8, 9 In addition, several lectins of diverse origins have shown immunomodulatory, anti-tumor, anti-microbial, and antiviral effects, [10] [11] [12] highlighting their potential use as drugs. Notwithstanding therapeutic potential demonstrated in vitro, the development of lectin-based antiviral therapeutics remains an underdeveloped area due to toxicity and/or limited availability. Actinohivin (AH) is an actinomycete-derived lectin recognizing the terminal a1,2-linked mannose residues on HMGs. 13, 14 AH was shown to neutralize HIV without inducing cytotoxicity or mitogenicity in human blood cells, 15 suggesting that this lectin may provide a useful tool for developing a new HMG-targeting agent. A major drawback, however, is that AH is highly hydrophobic, prone to aggregate, and, thus, recalcitrant to efficient recombinant production, hampering its development as a drug and/or biological tool. 15 Here, we engineered a new AH variant with improved biochemical and pharmaceutical properties, using a plant-virus-vector-based transient overexpression system as a rapid screening and scalable production platform. A soluble variant, termed Avaren (actinohivin variant expressed in Nicotiana), was obtained by structure-guided mutations and subsequently fused to the fragment crystallizable region (Fc) of the human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) subclass to create the \"lectibody\" AvFc. Our data show that AvFc is highly producible in a scalable plant-based system, has anti-HIV activity derived from Fc functions, and lacks significant toxicity, highlighting its potential utility in novel HMG-targeting anti-HIV strategies.",

            "text": "AH is composed of three near-homologous tandem repeats of a 38amino-acid domain harboring a binding pocket for an HMG. 13, 14 We hypothesized that the high aggregation propensity of AH could be improved by neutralizing its surface charge variation. Thus, we designed multiple AH variants by changing amino acids in one or two domains to corresponding residues in the other domain(s) so that all three domains are alike and have similar overall surface charge properties. For example, Gln9 (domain 1) and Gln47 (domain 2) were mutated to Glu to correspond to Glu85 in domain 3 ( Figure 1A ). To screen these variants, we used a plant-virus-vector-based transient overexpression system (magnICON) in N. benthamiana. 16 Five days post-vector inoculation (dpi), several variants showed higher levels of accumulation in leaf tissue than that of AH ( Figures 1B and 1C) . These variants were readily extracted from leaf tissue in PBS, indicative of their improved solubility. Direct ELISA and HIV Env glycoprotein gp120-capture ELISA showed that variant 8 accumulated at the highest level, reaching over 100 mg kg \u00c01 of leaf tissue, and retained gp120-binding capacity ( Figure 1C ) as well as anti-HIV activity ( Figure S1 ). By contrast, AH recovered from leaf tissue by PBS extraction was only $1 mg kg \u00c01 of leaf tissue (data not shown). Variant 8 was then named Avaren. In total, of the 114 amino acids in AH, 17 were modified to create Avaren ( Figure 1A ). Additionally, a disulfide bond was introduced at the rim of the sugar-binding pocket in domains 1 and 3, as originally found in domain 2 (confirmed by peptide mapping; Figure S2) . Circular dichroism (CD) analysis revealed an increase in random coils in Avaren's structure ( Figure 1D , top panel). Nevertheless, the overall structure appeared to be similar to that of AH ( Figure 1D , bottom panel). Homology modeling 17 showed closely superimposed structures of AH and Avaren, albeit with a loss of a b strand in the hinge between domains 2 and 3 of Avaren (Figure 1E ). The melting temperatures of Avaren and AH determined by CD were both 72.9 C, indicative of their similar structural stability. Collectively, it was concluded that Avaren has a better recombinant producibility in plants than AH while retaining overall conformational and functional properties.",

Approximately 1 g of purified AvFc was obtained from 10 kg plant biomass in a pilot-scale production facility. To determine AvFc's sugar binding specificity, a glycan array analysis was performed. Among 610 mammalian glycans analyzed, both AH and AvFc showed high specificity to oligomannose glycans containing terminal a-1,2-linked mannose ( Figure 2B ). In a gp120-capture ELISA, the lectibody's sugar-binding ability was abrogated upon gp120 treatment with a mannosidase, unlike the CD4 bindingsite-specific bNAb VRC01 19 but similarly to the Env-glycan-specific bNAb 2G12 20,21 ( Figure 2C ). These results demonstrate that AvFc retains the high HMG specificity of the original lectin AH. Notwithstanding, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis revealed that the lectibody has increased affinity to recombinant HIV gp120 proteins by approximately 10-fold, compared to AH ( Figure 2D ; Figure S3 ).",

            "text": "To investigate whether the increased gp120-binding affinity of AvFc translates into enhanced antiviral effects, we first performed a virus capture assay using Env-pseudotyped HIV-1 viruses. As shown in Figure 3A , AvFc caught the virions more effectively than AH for all three HIV-1 strains tested. In a pseudovirus neutralization assay using the tier-2 HIV-1 QH0692 clone, 22 AvFc showed significantly more potent activity than AH, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of 5.6 nM (versus 60.4 nM for AH), which is similar to that of VRC01 ( Figure 3B ). These results demonstrate that AvFc has significantly more potent HIV-1 neutralization activity than AH. Additionally, the lectibody showed a significantly stronger neutralization effect for the virus that was produced in the HEK293S GnTI \u00c0 cell line (thus displaying higher amounts of Env HMGs 23 ) than for the same virus produced in the standard HEK293T/17 cell line. This was in sharp contrast to the gp41-peptide-specific bNAb 4E10, 24 whose neutralization activity appeared to be indifferent to Env HMG levels ( Figure 3C ). Thus, the results indicate that the HIV-1 neutralization activity of AvFc is proportional to the total amount of HMGs present on the viral surface. To further confirm AvFc's anti-HIV activity, we tested its inhibitory activity against 20 different primary HIV strains that were produced in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Furthermore, we used human PBMCs from four different donors as target cells instead of a CD4-expressing cell line that was used in the pseudovirus assays. The lectibody, again, exhibited significantly stronger inhibitory activity than AH (p = 0.0003, Wilcoxon matched-pairs test), not only against HIV-1 Group M viruses but also against Group O and HIV-2 strains, with a median IC 50 of 0.3 nM or 0.02 mg/mL for AvFc versus 156.3 nM or 2.00 mg/mL for AH ( Figures 3D and 3E ). . (B) SDS-PAGE was performed to analyze crude extracts of N. benthamiana leaves expressing AH or its variants and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. At 5 dpi, leaf proteins were extracted with PBS (pH 7.2) containing 40 mM ascorbic acid using a 3:1 buffer-toleaf ratio. NI, non-infiltrated leaf extract; EV, empty-vector-infiltrated leaf extract; AH, AH-expressing leaf extract. Lanes 1-14: leaf extracts of AH variants. (C) Quantification of AH variants in N. benthamiana leaf tissue using direct and gp120-capture ELISA for total protein (hatched bars) and gp120-binding protein (black bars) detected by a rabbit anti-AH antiserum. Variant 8 was designated as Avaren. (D) CD analysis. Far-UV CD (top) and near-UV CD (bottom) spectra of AH and Avaren. (E) Crystal structure of AH (PDB: 4G1R) (orange) superimposed with a homology model of Avaren (green), shown from the top and side views (PyMOL software). Homology modeling was performed with SWISS-MODEL, using AH as a template. Zoomed images of the surface-exposed loop between domains 2 and 3 (amino acids 74-80) are boxed. (Table 1 ). AvFc's capability to bind to the aforementioned FcgRs was confirmed by flow cytometry using FcgRI-and FcgRIIIa-expressing cells ( Figures 4C and 4D ). By contrast, AvFc with an Asn200 / Gln mutation (N200Q-AvFc), which eliminates N-glycosylation in the Fc region corresponding to Asn297 of human IgG 1 and thereby significantly reduces affinity to these FcgRs, 25, 26 showed dramatically reduced binding to these receptors ( Figures 4C and 4D ; Table 1 ).",

The gp120-binding activities of AvFc and 2G12, but not of VRC01, were abolished by treating the Env protein with a-mannosidase, demonstrating AvFc's specificity to the terminal mannose residues of HMGs. (D) SPR analysis of the binding affinities of AH and AvFc to gp120 SF162 . The binding kinetics and affinities of AH (left) and AvFc (right) to gp120 SF162 were measured using a Biacore X100 2.0 instrument at ambient temperature. Representative sensorgrams are shown. A recombinant gp120 SF162 was captured on a sensor chip to a surface density of about 50-100 RU. 3-fold serial dilutions of AvFc (1 mg/mL to 0.0123 mg/mL) or AH (1 mg/mL to 0.0123 mg/mL) were injected at a flow rate of 5 mL/min. K D was determined based on steady state (inset). Data indicate mean \u00b1 SEM from two independent analyses. AvFc ( Figure 4E ), likely reflecting the mutant's significantly lower binding affinity to FcgRs (and, hence, lacking Fc-mediated antiviral effects). Furthermore, AvFc showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect in an antibody-dependent cell-mediated virus inhibition (ADCVI) assay 27 using primary human natural killer (NK) cells (Figure 4F ). AvFc's ADCVI activity was prominent at concentrations < 1 mg/mL and much stronger than that of VRC01, which had marginal effects at the same concentration range as shown in previous reports. 28, 29 Collectively, these data indicate that, in addition to virion neutralization activity, AvFc can elicit Fc-mediated anti-HIV activity via binding to HMGs on viruses and infected cells ( Figure 4G ).",

Similarly, in flow cytometry analysis, AvFc showed no induction of the activation markers CD25, CD69, and HLA-DR in CD4 cells ( Figures 5B-5D ) or size and morphological changes in the PBMC population ( Figure S6 ) that were clearly observed with ConA. Cytokine and chemokine release profiles in PMBCs stimulated with AvFc, analyzed using a multiplex bead array, ELISA, and qPCR, showed marginal impacts, if any (Figures 5E and S7; Table S1 ). These results suggest that AvFc has little mitogenicity or immunostimulatory activity that could pose an increased risk in HIV treatment. Next, rats were intravenously administered 4 mg kg \u00c01 of AvFc or Avaren. AvFc was detectable in the blood circulation up to 10 days post-administration, whereas Avaren was cleared within 24 h ( Figure 5F ). The extended half-life of AvFc is likely attributed to neonatal Fc receptor affinity (Table 1; Figure S4 ). Despite its persistence in vivo, AvFc did not appear to induce any adverse effect; to probe its potential toxicity further, the lectibody was administered at 5 or 20 mg kg \u00c01 twice a week over 5 weeks (10 doses total) to mice. No change was observed in behavior or body weight in all mice during the experiment (Figure 5G ). An increase of liver and spleen weights was observed after 35 days for the high-dose AvFc treatment group treated twice a week (p = 0.01 and 0.0001, respectively; Figure S8A ). This is likely due to an immune reaction to AvFc, as no distinct pathologies were observed in these tissues ( Figure S8B ); both Avaren and human Fc components are xenogeneic to mice. Serum chemistry showed a decrease in blood urea nitrogen and calcium levels for both doses of AvFc (p = 0.017 and 0.012, respectively; Figure 5H ; Table S2 ). However, the values were still within or close to the normal physiological ranges. Additionally, although not statistically significant, a trend of decrease was noted in creatinine and total bilirubin levels in AvFc-dosed groups. There was no significant difference in any of the complete blood count parameters tested between AvFc-treated and vehicle control-treated mice ( Figure 5I ; Table S3 ). Together, these results showed an overall lack of major toxicity upon AvFc systemic administration. ",

Toward this end, we first tested AvFc's capacity to neutralize three simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) strains, including SIVsmE660, SIVmac239, and SIVmac251, propagated in CEMx174 cells. The lectibody effectively neutralized these viruses, with IC 50 values of 15.3, 6.6, and 3.8 nM, respectively (Figure 6A) . Additionally, AvFc's ability to recognize infected cells was examined by flow cytometry, using rhesus macaque mesenteric lymph node (MLN) cells that were infected by SIVmac239 in vitro. The results showed that AvFc at 1 and 10 mg/mL could dose-dependently recognize SIVmac239-infected rhesus MLN cells. Notably, the higher concentration of AvFc showed no binding to uninfected MLN cells, indicating the lectibody's high selectively to infected cells (Figure 6B ). Lastly, two adult female rhesus macaques were subcutaneously administered with a single bolus dose of 21 mg (3.6 and 3.7 mg/kg, respectively). The lectibody was well tolerated, exhibiting an average half-life of 27.7 h ( Figure 6C ). Flow cytometry analysis of macaque PBMCs isolated 0, 4, and 72 h after AvFc administration showed evidence of a selective and temporal redistribution of some www.moleculartherapy.org cell subsets, including monocytes, dendritic cells, and NK cells, but no evidence of T cell activation ( Figures S9-S16) , consistent with data shown in Figure 5 for human PBMCs.",

AvFc was created by a combined approach using structure-guided modifications and a scalable plant-virus-vector-based transient overexpression system. The lectibody inhibited a wide range of HIV strains and elicited Fcmediated cytotoxicity to HIV-infected human PMBCs while not inducing detectable cell proliferation or causing noticeable toxicity upon systemic dosing at effective concentrations in animals. The present study illustrated that plant viral expression systems can provide a powerful tool for rapid screening and efficient production of novel recombinant proteins. The quantity of protein obtained and the ease with which multiple mutants can be made and tested using a transient plant expression system demonstrate the robustness and flexibility of this production platform, which can greatly facilitate drug discovery and production.",

            "text": "Our initial efforts focused on the engineering of AH mutants with improved solubility. Despite mutating as many as 15% of AH's amino acids, Avaren was shown to retain overall structural integrity and HMG-binding activity ( Figure 1 ). Thus, our approach of modifying AH's surface charge property has met with success. Using the ExPASy ProtParam tool, it was determined that Avaren has a theoretical isoelectric point (pI) of 5.13 and a grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) value of \u00c00.912, whereas AH has a theoretical pI of 8.59 and a GRAVY value of \u00c00.778. Accordingly, Avaren has overall lower surface charge and hydrophobicity than AH. Raghunathan et al. 30 have previously shown that protein surface charge engineering can modulate protein stability and aggregation properties. Thus, these findings suggest improved manufacturability of recombinant proteins. Other critical mutations responsible for Avaren's high production yield appeared to be the modification of the surface-exposed loop between domains 2 and 3 and the C-terminal amino acids to mimic the more hydrophilic corresponding residues between domains 1 and 2. Additionally, a charged surface-exposed residue located at position 9 in each module (i.e., Gln9, Gln47, and Glu85 of AH) appeared to be a critical factor determining bioproducibility; Glu seemed to be more favorable than Gln (see variants 7-10). Furthermore, Avaren has two new disulfide bonds at the rim of the sugar-binding pocket in domains 1 and 3, as originally found in domain 2. These new disulfide bonds appear to have partly contributed to the high accumulation level of Avaren in leaf tissue (compare variants 5 and 8), as the cysteine-free variants, variants 1, 11, and 12, showed a poor level of tissue accumulation similar to AH (Figures 1B and 1C) . It is possible that these disulfide bonds collectively facilitated proper tertiary structure formation in planta, leading to a high yield. Interestingly, variant 2 accumulated relatively well in leaf tissue yet lost the large part of gp120-binding ability ( Figures 1B and 1C) . This variant is similar to Avaren with 6 additional mutations, including Asn19 / Asp, Asn21 / Ala, Asn31 / Ser, Asn95 / Asp, Asn97 / Ala, and Asn107 / Ser. Combined with the results of variants 6, 13, and 14, we postulate that Asn21 and Asn97 may play a role in gp120 binding. These observations support the previously proposed notion that the open space between each sugar-binding pocket has Asn/Asp residues that help interact with HMGs. 14 It is notable that Avaren dimerization via Fc fusion had virtually no impact on the sugar-binding profile of the original molecule AH, again highlighting successful molecular engineering in the present study. Our data indicated that AvFc had higher capacity to capture HIV virions than AH, which was also reflected in the lectibody's increased functional affinity to gp120 in SPR analysis (Figures 2D, 3A, and S3). High avidity is a critical factor for lectins' antiviral activity. For example, the dimeric lectin griffithsin significantly lost its anti-HIV activity when the protein was mutated into a monomeric form. 31 Similarly, the monomer form of cyanovirin-N, which contains two sugar-binding sites, showed reduced anti-HIV activity when one of the sugar binding sites was mutated but restored activity upon dimerization. 32 Thus, the enhanced antiviral activity of AvFc over that of AH can be partly explained by increased avidity to Env glycans. However, findings in human primary cell-based assays (Figures 3D , 3E, 4E, and 4F) suggest that a significant part of AvFc's anti-HIV activity may be brought about by Fc functions. In particular, the strong ADCVI activity in Figure 3F indicates that AvFc can effectively recognize and aid in killing HIV-infected cells. This notion is further supported by our findings that AvFc showed no cytotoxicity or sugarspecific interaction in normal human PBMCs ( Figures 5A and S5) , while it efficiently bound to SIVmac239-infected, but not uninfected, macaque MLN cells ( Figure 6B ). These results highlight AvFc's capacity to selectively target HIV-infected cells, which is an unprecedented feature for Env-glycan-targeting lectins described to date. The results further point to the possibility that AvFc could be used to detect and/or eliminate sites of residual viral replication in vivo, in addition to neutralizing free viruses in the circulation.",

The slope of AvFc's inhibitory curves appeared to be lower for HIV-2 than for HIV-1 strains ( Figure 3D ), which may be due to difference in their Env glycosylation patterns 33 and indicative of distinct antiviral mechanisms. 34 Additionally, among the three SIV strains tested in Figure 6A , the most AvFc-resistant strain, E660, has the least number of predicted Env N-glycans compared to mac239 and mac251 (21, 24 , and 23, respectively; NetNGlyc 1.0 Server tool). We speculate that some glycans at specific locations on Env, rather than the total number of glycans, are critical to AvFc's neutralization effects. Identification of such glycans is currently underway. There is some evidence to suggest that HIV can evolve to obtain resistance to antiviral lectins via deglycosyla- tion. 35, 36 However, deglycosylation of Env glycoproteins may result in the unmasking of critical epitopes, making the virus more sensitive to host immunoglobulins, 12, 35, 37 and AvFc may still be able to recognize and kill infected cells expressing partially deglycosylated Env, since complete deglycosylation of Env is unlikely due to the critical roles of at least some N-glycans in Env assembly and viral infectivity. [38] [39] [40] Additionally, the ability of AvFc to neutralize not only group M viruses but also group O, HIV-2, and SIV strains may be an advantage over (or a complement to) contemporary bNAbs, which may not recognize and neutralize beyond group M viruses. Because HMGs are widely found on the glycoproteins of enveloped viruses, 12 there is a possibility that AvFc exhibits neutralization activity against other viruses as well. In our preliminary study, we found that AvFc holds nanomolar affinity to glycoproteins of hepatitis C virus, various influenza strains, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( Figure S18 ; Table S4 ). Although these glycoproteins showed a lower affinity than HIV-1 gp120, the results suggest that AvFc could be used as a broad-spectrum www.moleculartherapy.org antiviral agent, although binding to envelope glycoproteins alone does not guarantee antiviral activity. Studies are currently underway to address this possibility.",

The first is the potential for immunogenicity to the molecule that could curtail its efficacy and/or safety in repeated treatments. The present animal studies were not suited to address the potential immunogenicity of AvFc, because the Fc domain of AvFc is of human origin, which itself would be immunogenic in mice and monkeys. Given that experimental animal models have a limited predictive value for the assessment of therapeutic protein immunogenicity in humans, 41,42 the use of AvFc variants with a species-specific Fc domain is, at least, essential to address the immunogenicity question in preclinical studies. Should this, indeed, be an issue, several potential remedies may be tested to minimize immunogenicity, including T cell epitope deletion, pegylation, and others, though these studies were beyond the scope of the present report. Second, AvFc showed a relatively short serum halflife of 27.7 h in rhesus macaques ( Figure 6C ). This may be, in part, due to slightly decreased affinity to FcRn compared to a human IgG1 isotype control, as shown in Table 1 . A potential solution may be the modification of the Fc region to improve FcRn affinity, such as those described by Zalevsky et al. 43 Additionally, studies are underway to determine the biodistribution profile and off-target binding potential of AvFc. While normal cells do not typically display high amounts of HMGs at their surface, these immature glycans have been found to be enriched in the plasma membranes of cancer cells [44] [45] [46] and embryonic stem cells. 47, 48 A future study should carefully evaluate what cell types other than HIV-or SIV-infected cells are recognized by AvFc.",

The ability of AvFc to inhibit diverse HIV strains and recognize HIV-and SIV-infected primary cells, coupled with the apparent lack of toxicity upon systemic administration, warrants additional exploration of its therapeutic potential in non-human primate models of HIV infection. Additional engineering to improve pharmacological profile, such as deimmunization and Fc modifications for extended serum half-life and enhanced ADCC activity, may be necessary to further AvFc's drug potential. In this regard, efficient, cost-effective, and rapid plant-based bioproduction in greenhouse facilities will facilitate such endeavors and may open unique possibilities for lectibody-based antiviral drug development.",

Statistical significance was analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's post-tests or Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test as indicated in the figure legends, using the GraphPad Prism 6 software. Differences were considered statistically significant if p < 0.05.",
