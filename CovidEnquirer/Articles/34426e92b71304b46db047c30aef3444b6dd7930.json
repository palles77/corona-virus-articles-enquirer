            "text": "Canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) has recently been detected in dogs; it is a group 2 coronavirus showing similarity to bovine coronavirus (BCoV) but is distinct from canine enteric coronavirus (CECoV). CRCoV may play an important role in canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) either by predisposing to further and potentially more serious viral and bacterial infections or possibly as a primary pathogen. The prevalence of serum antibodies to CRCoV, in a population of dogs in the south east of England, has been shown previously to be 30.1% on the first day of entry to a rehoming kennel [Erles, K., Toomey, C., Brooks, H.W., Brownlie, J., 2003. Detection of a group 2 coronavirus in dogs with canine infectious respiratory disease. Virology 310, 216-223]. The purpose of this study was to establish the prevalence of CRCoV in the general canine population within as well as outside the UK. An ELISA, used to test for the presence of antibodies to CRCoV in canine serum samples, identified seropositive dogs in UK, USA, Canada, Republic of Ireland and Greece. The development of an ELISA based on CRCoV antigen and immunofluorescence assay are described here. 54.7% (547/1000) of North American and 36.0% (297/824) of United Kingdom dogs were seropositive for CRCoV. The age and geographical distribution of seropositive dogs was also assessed. The cross-reactivity demonstrated between CRCoVantibodies from different countries and a UK viral isolate suggests immunological similarity. The overall prevalence of this virus in both North America and the UK suggests that CRCoV has international significance and that further epidemiological studies are required. #",

            "text": "This study for the first time revealed the presence of canine antibodies to CRCoV outside the United Kingdom. Serological evidence for the existence of CRCoV in the United States, Canada, the Republic of Ireland and Greece is presented here. The BCoV ELISA had previously been shown to be specific for CRCoVand there was no cross-reactivity with CECoV antibodies (Erles et al., 2003) . The cross-reactivity of BCoV ELISA antigen with canine antibodies suggests immunological, as well as genetic, similarity with CRCoV. In addition antibodies from dogs originating from other countries, bound to CRCoV antigen, produced from a United Kingdom isolate (4182), suggesting a high degree of geographical immunological cross-reactivity. This implies either restricted epitopic diversity or conservation of immunologically dominant domains. Cross-reactivity between CRCoV and CECoV has not definitively been ruled out. The genetic similarity of BCoV and CRCoV based on the translated amino acid sequence of the main antigenic determinant, the spike protein, has been established as 96% compared with a 21% identity to CECoV (Erles et al., 2003) . Furthermore it is possible (and sometimes quite likely given the epidemiology of the two viruses) that antibodies to both viruses could occur in the same serum sample. In order to definitively rule out the possibility of any cross-reactivity between the two coronaviruses, inoculation of experimental animals with either CRCoV or CECoV, followed by cross-neutralisation, would have to be performed. Overall seroprevalence of CRCoV in North America was 54.7%, compared to 36.0% in the United Kingdom. This data indicates that the prevalence of CRCoV may be around a third greater in North America. Prevalence in Ireland (Republic of Ireland [ROI] and Northern Ireland) was 32.5%. Previously CRCoV antibodies were found in 30.1% of dogs on the day of entry to a rehoming kennel in the London area (Erles et al., 2003) , this work suggests that this estimate may be low compared to the overall prevalence for London of 50.8%. However seropositivity had risen to 99% after 21 days in the kennel, i.e. almost all dogs negative on entry showed seroconversion to CRCoV within 3 weeks, indicating that the virus was highly contagious (Erles et al., 2003) and prevalent in the kennel environment. CRCoV prevalence appears to correlate to some degree with population density in the UK and Ireland. In regions with low population density (and possibly low canine density) the seroprevalence of CRCoV is generally low; the southwest of England and Wales in particular have a low prevalence of antibodies. The main urban areas appear to have a greater incidence of CRCoV antibodies. Exceptions would include East Anglia, North Yorkshire and in particular Scotland however, where the bulk of samples originated from one large town or city (e.g. Glasgow) in an otherwise sparsely populated region, thus the regions appear to have an overall high CRCoV seroprevalence. Diagnostic laboratories often receive samples from a selective number of veterinary practices, thus a certain degree of geographical selection might be expected in such studies and would account for findings such as in Ayrshire, Scotland where the 61.1% seropostivity more accurately reflects that of Glasgow.",

In North America 23.6% of dogs less than 6 months of age had antibodies to CRCoV; this suggests that dogs are challenged from a young age, possibly via the dam, and subsequently develop an immune response. However in both the UK and North America, dogs under 6 months of age were significantly less likely to have antibodies to CRCoV than older dogs. This finding is similar to the situation with CECoV where seropositivity is significantly lower at less than 6 months of age (Tennant et al., 1991) . Both North American and United Kingdom/ROI dogs showed a marked increase in antibodies to CRCoV from 6 months of age onwards, this likely corresponds to the beginning of socialisation and mixing with other dogs. United Kingdom/ROI dogs appear to have two peaks in CRCoV antibody prevalence, around 3 years and again at 12 years of age, however the differences are not statistically significant (P = 0.444 and 0.144 respectively) thus may be artefactual and disappear with an increased number of samples. Samples from North American dogs show a distribution with a gradual rise in seroprevalence to a peak between 7 and 8 years. In both North America and UK/ROI seroprevalence slowly declines with increasing age after 10-12 years. This could be explained by an age-related fall in the efficiency of the immune system and antibody production.",

The sensitivity and specificity of both the CRCoV antigen based ELISA and the BCoV antigen ELISA, taking immunofluorescence assay to be the 'gold standard', were high, thus endorsing the seroprevalence data presented. The ability to culture CRCoV in HRT-18 cells has allowed the development of a successful, specific CRCoV antigen ELISA and this will be useful in further epidemiological surveys of CRCoV.",

However the North American sera were from clinically healthy dogs, whose serum had been submitted to determine the antibody status of the dogs as an assessment of whether the animals needed a booster vaccination, thus should give a reasonably accurate estimate of seroprevalence.",
