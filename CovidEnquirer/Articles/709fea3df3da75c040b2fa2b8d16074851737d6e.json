However, there is a lack of empirical evidence to support this assertion. The study aims to examine the accuracy of news reports in Hong Kong (HK) and in particular whether or not such reports stereotype victims according to gender and suicide method. Methods: Data from a case-control psychological autopsy (PA) study of 150 HK suicides were utilized. The reports of the PA cases from five major HK newspapers were collected and reviewed to identify whether or not there was a match in terms of the cases' profile and risk factors. Results: The age, gender, and method of the suicides were largely reported correctly (>70%) but accounts of risk factors were seldom accurate (b 46%). No significant difference was found between tabloid-and non-tabloid-type newspapers' accuracy. Media stereotyping of genderspecific suicide and charcoal-burning suicide was identified. Limitations: The study was based on a HK sample so the findings are not necessarily applicable elsewhere.",

Inaccurate, rather than simply irresponsible, reporting of suicide is also noteworthy but lessstudied by comparison. Previous studies tend to measure irresponsible reporting in terms of the amount of coverage, placement (in terms of front page and use of pictures), and whether or not the method and location are described in detail. In contrast, inaccurate reporting denotes presenting the information incorrectly or falsely, including overlooking or simplifying some details and engaging in problematic stereotyping.",

First of all, given the mass media's enormous penetration of daily life, the untruthful or problematic stereotyping found in the \"massmediated reality\" of suicide can lead to the creation of myths among the general public and make evidence-based prevention harder to promote (Fishman and Weimann, 1997; Hawton and Williams, 2002) . In addition, such stereotyping may establish a linkage between certain life stressors and suicidal behaviors, which may influence vulnerable people to copy others' suicide through the social learning process (Fu et al., 2009 ). Last but not least, reporting accurately is the minimum acceptable standard of journalism, whereas reporting responsibly aspires to a rather higher level of performance. From a practical perspective, pushing the media to improve their practice beyond the minimum standard is likely to be easier than encouraging them to achieve even higher levels of performance.",

The articles' reporting accuracy was examined by comparing the PA and news report for each individual case. The PA study included 150 individuals aged 15-59 who had committed suicide between August 2002 and December 2004. These cases were representative of all suicides in this age group in HK in 2003 in terms of the distribution of age, gender, and method (incorporating the three most common methods). The case-control PA study obtained some of its factual information from the coroner's report and also included a systematic and comprehensive analysis of the psychological and contextual circumstances preceding the suicide. The PA methodology is generally accepted as valid and the data obtained from informants have been demonstrated to be reliable (Cavanagh et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2006) . Certainly, some caution is warranted, since the methodology is still developing and has potential drawbacks. Recently some researchers have suggested that future PA studies should extend their interview content to areas such as the role of personality traits, illness, and the availability of lethal agents and also improve their interview procedures to minimize recall bias (Conner et al., 2011 (Conner et al., , 2012 . Nevertheless, at the time of writing the PA study can be considered as the \"gold standard\" for comparison with media reports. In addition, the PA research method is similar to journalism in the sense that it involves interviewing informants who were familiar with the deceased. Therefore, a comparison between media reporting and the PA study using the same suicide cases can demonstrate the differences between the perspectives and perceptions of journalists and suicide prevention professionals.",

These cover various readerships and are often selected by researchers doing media studies in HK (Au et al., 2004; Fu et al., 2011) . As the PA study had recruited cases based on the coroner's report, the official coroner's record of the cases was also documented in the PA database, although the deceased's name was recoded as a number and his or her HK ID card number was removed. We first tracked each PA case back to its coroner's record and established a detailed profile for it. When linking the cases to news articles, we first searched on the deceased's name and the date of incidence as identified from the coroner's report. However, in some cases only the deceased's surname was reported in the papers. In this case, the date of occurrence, place, and/or suicide method were also used as search keywords. This process was repeated until we were certain that the case could be linked with specific news articles. The search time period was set as 0-5 days after each incidence to avoid missing any coverage, although the mass media tend to report these events in a timely fashion. The first author then double-checked all the articles to make sure the linkage is robust.",

Among these six factors, retrospective diagnosis with a psychiatric illness is a determination that can only be made by a qualified and registered psychiatrist, so it is unreasonable to expect a journalist to obtain this information. We therefore excluded this aspect from our review of the articles. Instead, an alternative criterion was included, that of having previously been treated for emotional problems. This is because, according to the guidelines for responsible reporting of suicides, the individual's personal mental-health history should be mentioned (Leung, 2004) .",

However, this kind of accuracy may actually be harmful in terms of the media's social responsibility in suicide prevention. Specifically, the accurate reporting of method and location can be disturbing because readers may learn about methods or get ideas from reading the articles (Liu et al., 2007; Yip and Lee, 2007) . As for the why, suicide risk factors were often simplified, if not ignored entirely, by the HK newspapers. Guidelines or recommendations for the media reporting of suicide often highlight that it is desirable to provide accurate facts about the causes in order that the public may benefit from an improved awareness of mental health and suicide prevention (Hawton and Williams, 2002; Pirkis et al., 2006) .

This approach is neither professional nor ethical. By identifying these discrepancies, suicide prevention professionals can develop more effective strategies for cooperating with media professionals and persuading them to develop more sensitive attitudes and more prudent working behaviors when reporting on suicide. In addition, they should promote among journalists the view that suicide is a complicated phenomenon and there are various risk factors.",
