A simple and rapid detection test was developed for this virus using real-time RT-LAMP based on the conserved N gene of the virus. The method had a detection limit of 1.0 \u00d7 10 1 copies/\u03bcL with no cross-reactions with classical swine fever virus, porcine and respiratory syndrome virus NA, porcine and respiratory syndrome virus EU, transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus, foot and mouth disease virus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (S-INDEL and non-S-INDEL), swine influenza virus subtype H1N1, porcine circovirus type 2, seneca valley virus, porcine parvovirus, porcine deltacoronavirus and rotavirus. This method was also reproducible. Twenty of 24 clinical samples were identified as SADS-CoV RNA-positive by the real-time RT-LAMP and the results were consistent with that of the real time RT-PCR method. This new method for detecting SADS-CoV is specific and sensitive for the detection of SADS-CoV. \u204e Corresponding authors.",

At that time, several pathogens were tested for these cases of diarrhea, including enteric coronaviruses porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). However, all samples were negative for the presence of these three pathogens (Pan et al., 2017) . In September 2017, a novel swine enteric alphacoronavirus (SeACoV) also named as bat-HKU2-like porcine coronavirus (PEAV) or swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) was identified in southern China (Gong et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018a,b) . The mortality rate was more than 35% in swine that were less than 10 days old and caused serious economic losses to the swine industry (Pan et al., 2017) . All affected pigs showed acute vomiting and severe watery diarrhea, similar to clinical signs caused by PEDV, TGEV and PDCoV. A reliable and simple diagnostic method for the surveillance of SADS-CoV was needed to distinguish between these viral pathogens.",

PCR amplification from SADS-CoV N gene (1128bp) were amplified using standard PCR conditions and cloned into pGEM T easy vector (Promega, Madison, USA) between T7 RNA polymerase and SP6 polymerase promoter.

To remove plasmid DNA, 40 units RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, USA) enzyme was used.

Ten-fold serial dilutions of N gene RNA templates were used to calculate the analytical sensitivity and assess assay reproducibility. The method was further evaluated using 24 clinical specimens from pigs with diarrhea that had been previously evaluated by a real-time RT-PCR assay (Zhou et al., 2018a) .

However, its detection was problematic since the disease symptoms are similar to other viruses (Jung et al., 2016; Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978; Stevenson et al., 2013) . Although a TaqMan-based real-time RT-PCR assay had already been developed for SADS-CoV, this method required expensive equipment and supplies.
