PHARMACOL BIOCHEM BEHAV 49(3) 711-728, 1994. --Ibogalne, a serotonergic (5-HTergic) indole alkaloid, was studied for cocaine modulatory effects on four parameters of behavior by computerized infrared photocell beam detection. The behavioral parameters were: a) locomotor activity (ambulations), b) rearing, c) stereotypy (fine movements, primarily grooming), and d) agoraphobia [(thigmotaxis) a natural tendency to avoid the center of the behavioral chamber]. With each behavioral data point, dopamine (DA) release, and serotonin (5-HT) release were detected within seconds in nucleus accumbens (NAcc) of the same behaving male Sprague-Dawley rats, using in vivo electrochemistry (voltammetry). Ibogaine was administered (40 mg/ kg IP) for 4 consecutive days. Importantly, the DAergic and the 5-HTergic responses to (SC) cocaine and two behavioral responses, ambulations and central ambulations, were reduced in intensity due to extended time spent in the novel behavioral chamber (habituated). Rearing and fine movement patterns were not habituated. The results show that ibogaine downmodulated the (SC) cocaine-induced increase in NAcc DA release (p < 0.0001) and potentiated the (SC) cocaine-induced decrease in NAcc 5-HT release (p < 0.0001). Concurrently, ibogaine downmodulated cocaine-induced ambulation (p < 0.0001) and central ambulation behavior (p < 0.0001). On the other hand, the behavioral parameters that did not exhibit habituation, i.e., rearing behavior and fine movement behavior, were not downmodulated by ibogalne (p < 0.1558) (p < 0.3763), respectively. Furthermore, ibogaine itself did not significantly alter NAcc DA release over the 2-h period studied (p < 0.9113) although individual time points were significantly affected bidirectionally. Concurrently ibogaine significantly increased 5-HT release (p < 0.0155). Behaviorally, ibogalne appears to be a weak psychostimulant. The data show a critical modulatory role for 5-HT in ibogaine-cocalne interactions. Also elucidated as critical is the efficacy of ibogaine when the response to (SC) cocaine is decreased due to the habituation of the animals to their environment.",

            "text": "2 Requests for reprints should be addressed to Dr. P. A. Broderick Trademarks (39) . Presently, Phase l clinical trials to determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of ibogaine (HC1) are progressing (44) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) is reported to be actively supporting studies to ascertain the clinical importance of ibogaine (67) . Ibogaine also has a rather unique scientific and historical perspective as well, in its pharmacognosy, chemistry, and in its pharmacology. The pharmacognosy of ibogaine describes the plant as the yellowish root of the African shrub Tabernanthe iboga Baillon of the family Apocynaceae. The plant is cultivated in Gabon, Africa. Interestingly, either rarely known or emphasized, is the fact that the alkaloids of the genera Apocynaceae have found extensive use in modern medicine, an example of which is the Rauwolfia alkaloids, from which the well-known drug reserpine is derived. The chemistry of ibogaine places this compound as an indole alkaloid, similar in structure to the neurotransmitter, serotonin (5-HT). L-Tryptophan is the precursor for ibogaine, which places ibogaine in the same biochemical pathway as 5-HT. Ibogaine was first isolated in 1901 by Dybowski and Landrin [cited in (21) ]. The chemical structure of ibogaine is known; its molecular formula is (C20HE6N20) (23) . Brain concentrations of ibogaine can be determined by thin layer chromatography, and concentrations of ibogaine in blood and urine can be determined by ultraviolet spectrophotometric assay (22) . The structural formula of ibogaine, which was suggested by Taylor in 1957 (66) , has been confirmed by x-ray crystallography (1) . The structure of many of the other iboga alkaloids have been deduced from that of ibogaine (23) . Interestingly, the origin of the indole alkaloid structure per se is predicated on yohimbine, a well known c~2-adrenoreceptor antagonist, which is actually derived from/-tryptophan, phenylalanine, and formaldehyde by two Mannich condensations (65) . There are other structural types of alkaloids of Apocynaceae, e.g., the isomeric quinindolines and quinindoles, such as quinolinic acid, are representative of one of the other basic structural types.",

Ibogaine was found to decrease blood pressure in anesthetized animals and to increase blood pressure in unanesthetized animals (27) . Ibogaine was found to produce bradycardia; the bradycardic effect was potentiated by both domperidone and sulpiride, D E receptor antagonists and by atropine, a muscarinic cholinergic antagonist (35) . There have been reports that tabernanthine, an ibogaine congener, is a calcium entry blocker that also affects cellular calcium metabolism by inhibiting norepinephrine (NE) and calcium (Ca2+)induced vascular contractions (34) . In other similar studies, tabernanthine was found to have a dose-dependent potentiation (low dose) and inhibition (high dose) of contractions elicited by NE in the mesenteric artery so that it has actions related to the turnover of intracellular Ca 2+ releasable by NE (45) . Peripherally, tabernanthine has been observed to potentiate Ca 2+ responses and produce a catecholamine sensitization in isolated rat duodenum (70) . Finally, ibogaine itself produces hypoglycemia (21) .",

Cappendijk and Dzoljic (15) have reported that the tremorigenic dose of ibogaine is 80 mg/kg and a lower dose of 40 mg/kg produces less prominent and shorter-lasting behavioral effects than the higher dose. Although, it has been shown that ibogaine itself did not interact at either the benzodiazepine receptor or the closely related GABAA receptor (19) , the tremor induced by a related compound, tabernanthine, has been studied; tabernanthine acted as a benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist in vitro in a discriminant binding assay. In addition, a tabernanthine-induced tremor was functionally inhibited by the benzodiazepine antagonist, RO-15,1788 (69) .",

These results are consistent with data from sleep studies that show that the ibogaine congeners, tabernanthine tartrate and tabernanthine parachlorophenoxyacetate (SAD 103), provoked an increase in wakefulness level, a reduction in the level of slow wave sleep, and a transient blocking of paradoxical sleep (17, 18) . Both ibogaine and its congener tabernanthine produced an increase in the energy of the theta band frequency (5-6 Hz) and increased the duration of wakefulness in rats and the level of vigilance in the human. Indeed, ibogaine was reported to act like an antidepressant in these sleep paradigms (20, 33) . Studies on the hallucinatory effects of ibogaine in humans have been reported [(58) and cited by Dhahir, 1971 (21) ]. According to the latter citation (21) , Dr. Sigg has described his own experiences with ibogaine as the following: \"visual hallucinations, blue disks appearing only in the dark, accompanied by many other symptoms common to hallucinogenic intoxication, but no undesirable after effects, [such as] exhaustion or depression were noted.\"",

The findings showed that ibogaine (50 mg/kg IP) was located in high concentrations in the liver, kidneys, and brain. Concentrations of ibogaine, however, were not cumulative and ibogaine disappeared at a rate of 4% of the injected dose per hour. About 507o of the injected dose of ibogaine was excreted unchanged in urine. The tissue : blood ratio was high, suggesting that the blood may not be the specimen of choice for postmortem toxicological analysis. Further, toxicological studies using chronic doses of ibogaine showed that ibogaine (10 and 50 mg/kg IP) did not cause any significant pathologic changes in the liver, kidney, heart, and brain when ibogaine was administered for 30 consecutive days, and no pathologic changes were observed in the liver or kidneys after ibogaine (40 mg/kg) was administered for 12 consecutive days. By comparison, when 5-HT was administered in doses of 10 mg/kg (base) for 12 consecutive days, severe damage to the kidney characteristic of ischemic coagulation necrosis occurred (21) . More recent findings show that ibogaine at high doses (100 mg/kg IP) and administered chronically, activates glial ceils in distinct longitudinal zones of the cerebellum, and causes degeneration of Purkinje cells, the major neurons of the cerebellar cortex. Interestingly, prior destruction of the inferior olive blocked Purkinje cell destruction (47, 48) . However, in many other brain areas, O'Hearn and Molliver found no evidence of ibogaine toxicity [citation in (67) ].",

Our light microscopic immunocytochemical evidence for 5-HT in A~0 nerve terminals shows that the core of NAcc contains a dense terminal field of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) axons that have an extensive overlap with 5-HT axons in the periphery within the core (51, 52) . Importantly, we have studied the region of NAcc that is ventral and lateral to the anterior commissure. This region has been referred to as ventrolateral NAcc (vlNAcc) by Swanson and Cowan (64) ; it has been suggested by these authors that vlNAcc has reciprocal connections with ventrai tegmental area (VTA). Our findings of 5-HT axons in close proximity to DA neurons in vlNAcc are consistent with ultrastructural studies that show 5-HT immunoreactive terminals in the core and shell of medial NAcc (72) and with very recent studies that show a prominence of asymmetric junctions formed by 5-HTlabeled terminals on neurons projecting to the NAcc with those containing tyrosine hydroxylase in the VTA (71) .",

Changes in synaptic concentrations of DA and 5-HT reflect presynaptic release mechanisms because in vivo microvoltammetric studies using 3,BL, have shown that cocaine does not increase DA concentrations in the presence of an impulse flow blocker (8) . The results of the in vivo microvoltammetric studies are consistent with earlier studies that have described the dopamine releasing properties of cocaine (56) .

Figure 1 shows a voltammogram of sequentially detected DA and 5-HT release in vlNAcc of freely moving and behaving Sprague-Dawley rats. Even at high concentrations, the anionic metabolite of DA, i.e., 3,4 dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), cannot be detected. At high concentrations ascorbic acid (AA), the cofactor in the DA biosynthetic pathway, can be detected. However, AA can be detected at 0.050 V, a different peak potential (E~p) than that for DA or 5-HT. The neurotransmitter, 5-HT was detected < t_ t_. within a 10-12 s time period, at an Eao of +0.290 V + 0.015 V.

Uric acid (UA), which is a constituent of brain with similar electroactive Eap properties to those of 5-HT, can be detected but not at the same peak potential as that for 5-HT. Increasing the concentrations of DA and 5-HT did not significantly affect either signal. Each voltammogram was completed within 60 s. Each voltammogram, consisting of detection of faradaic in vivo electrochemical signals for DA and 5-HT, was completed in 25 s.

A medium exchange technique was performed on each microelectrode in vitro before surgical insertion and implantation of the microelectrode in vivo. This procedure consisted of performing a selective preconcentration of the analytes DA and 5-HT onto the microelectrode surface in saline phosphate buffer (0.01 M) pH 7.4 in a closed semidifferential circuit scanning from -0.2 V to +0.4 V at 2 nA/V for three to five exposures with a 2-min cell deposition.

These regions were then used for more descriptive measures of, e.g., entries spent in the center of the cage. This central entries parameter of locomotor behavior becomes a reliable measure of thigmotaxia, i.e., the agoraphobic response, which is considered to be equivalent to fear (28) . Moreover, rearing, wherein both forepaws of the animal are away from the floor for a period of at least 1 s, was measured by another series of infrared photobeams situated about 6 inches from the floor of the behavioral chamber. An IBM computer sampled the status of all the beams and the circuits in the behavioral chamber every 100 ms. The system is a custom modified version of an Activity Pattern Monitor (APM) (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA). Each parameter of behavior was monitored concurrently with the online detection of DA release and the separate yet concurrent detection of 5-HT release.",

Therefore, antiagoraphobic or antithigmotactic behavior, which is thought to represent or reflect an anxiolytic (anxiety-reducing) behavior, undergoes habituation such as that which was seen with the DA and 5-HT response and with the ambulatory response. Importantly, ibogaine downmodulated the habituated behavioral responses to (SC) cocaine, whereas the behavioral responses that were not diminished by habituation were not significantly affected by ibogaine. Figure 13 shows activity patterns for the habituated salinecocaine paradigm described in Figs. 5 and 11, i.e., when cocaine was administered after a 2-h saline study. Ambulatory and central ambulatory moments are shown. The initial stimulation caused by saline injection due to arousal is shown in the first hour postsaline pattern. The habituation response to cocaine is clear as compared with Fig. 14 which describes the nonhabituated response to (SC) cocaine, i.e., when no additional time is spent by the animal in the novel behavioral chamber. Figure 15 shows activity patterns for the habituated ibogaine-cocaine paradigm, i.e., when cocaine is administered after a 2-h ibogaine study. Ambulatory and central ambulatory moments are shown. Ibogaine itself appears to be a weak psychostimulant; the effects are ongoing in the second hour. A comparison of Figs. 13 and 15 shows that although cocaineinduced ambulations are reduced after ibogaine pretreatment, some activity remains which is clearly greater than that seen in the saline-cocaine group. Tables 1 and 2 show the highly significant correlative values between cocaine-induced 5-HT release in vlNAcc and cocaine-induced psychostimulant behaviors as well as the highly correlative values between cocaine-induced DA release and psychostimulant behaviors, both in the ibogaine-cocaine group (Table 1 ) and in the saline-cocaine group ( Table 2) .",

The important distinction between the present studies and previous studies is that the present data are derived from a freely moving and behaving rat paradigm in which DA responses to (SC) cocaine have been diminished due to environmental habituation, i.e., each animal had a reduced responsiveness to DA release after (SC) cocaine, presumably due to the repeated environmental stimulation in the novel behavioral chamber. Moreover, this effect of (SC) cocaine on DA release on vlNAcc in an extended habituated environment was compared with previous studies in which the paradigm was completely the same with the one exception, that the protocol did not have an extended habituation component (7) . The response to cocaine in the habituated environment fits the classical definition of neurochemical habituation, i.e., that repeated action potentials in nerve terminals can accompany behavioral habituation by decreasing the number of open CA 2+ channels and inactivating synapses (36) .",

            "text": "These findings of the habituation aspects of ibogainecocaine interactions point to the necessity of a crucial assessment of the previous ibogaine-cocaine literature within the context of the varied experimental paradigms. Although there has been a recent surge of interest in preclinical research on the mechanism of action of ibogaine, there are only two previous papers specifically on ibogaine-cocaine DAergic interactions. One article is from the laboratory of Glick in the U.S. (40) , and the other is from the laboratory of Dzoljic in The Netherlands (15) . There are relevant differences in paradigms, i.e., a) Glick repetitive doses of ibogaine (40 mg/kg IP), and c) Glick's laboratory studied cocaine-induced extracellular concentrations of DA and locomotor behavior, whereas Dzoljic's laboratory studied the ability of ibogaine to affect the selfadministration of cocaine. The conclusions were consistent in that a potentiation of the cocaine-induced increase in extracellular concentrations of DA by ibogaine occurred (the ibogaine was administrated 19 h earlier) (40) , and there was a longlasting effect of ibogaine in its reported inhibition of cocaine self-administration (15) . Because DA antagonists classically increase the rate of cocaine self-administration (74), yet, given certain caveats, e.g., various rates of responding measures, the previous data may suggest that ibogaine does not act on cocaine self-administration through a direct DA receptor blockade. Consistent with the present findings is a previous study that reported that ibogaine per se did not significantly affect DA release in NAcc (41) . That ibogaine had no effects on extracellular concentrations of DA, as studied by dialysis, was again reported in 1992 by Maisonneuve and Glick (40) . It is important to note that postmortem HPLC-EC assays of ibogaine's effects on DA levels later showed that ibogaine decreased DA levels by 50070 1 h after ibogaine injection in NAcc, but 1 month later, DA was entirely unaffected by ibogaine (43) . Expectedly, the postmortem assay may have had additional variables as compared with results derived from in vivo microvoltammetry or dialysis studies. Nonetheless, the empirical data, to date, show that the general overall effects of ibogaine per se on NAcc DA release over time are not prominent.",

            "text": "Further support for ibogaine's inability to affect DA presynaptically in central nervous system is gleaned from reuptake studies, i.e., a) ibogaine at concentrations as high as 100 /~M did not significantly inhibit [3H] GBR-12935 binding to the DA transporter protein and 1 #M of ibogaine had no effect on in vitro striatal DA reuptake by a P2 membrane fraction (14) , b) in vivo treatment with ibogaine did not affect the binding of [3H] WIN 35, 248 to the cocaine binding site in striatal tissue measured in vitro (60) , and (c) ibogaine added, in vitro, had a weak affinity for the WIN 35,248 binding site (60) . Too, although the data, based on the action of ibogaine on DA receptors are incomplete, neither the D~ or the D 2 receptors in rat striatum and calf caudate, as studied by radioligands SCH 23390 and N-methyl spiperone respectively, were affected by ibogaine (19) . Thus, ibogaine may not act through DA receptors to downmodulate the cocaine induced increase in DA release in vlNAcc at the synapse. Ibogaine may act to downmodulate DA release at the synapse only under conditions of increased DA release and/or reuptake inhibition. Under the usual hypoxic conditions of increased DA release (12) , studies of ibogaine and DA function further support the latter hypothesis (16) . Thus, ibogaine's action on cocaine-induced DA release may well depend on the availability of DA at the synapse at least in an animal model of environmental habituation. Preliminary data from our laboratory show that ibogaine may not downmodulate DA release in vlNAcc after cocaine administration, when the animal has not undergone an extended habituation to its environment. An habituated environment may be a key to the underlying mechanism of action of cocaine on DA function.",

Changes in 5-HT release in vlNAcc after cocaine were detected on line and concurrently with the action of cocaine on in vivo detection of DA release. Importantly, the (SC) cocaine response to 5-HT was also habituated; 5-HT release in vlNAcc was reduced by more than 35%. The administration of ibogaine subsequently potentiated the habituated, reduced 5-HT response in vlNAcc seen after (SC) cocaine administration. This is an unexpected finding because ibogaine per se significantly increased 5-HT release in vlNAcc, as shown in Fig. 3 . Interestingly, in the presence of (SC) cocaine, it appears that ibogaine acts at the synapse to further decrease 5-HT when 5-HT is less available a priori.",

Metabolites of iboga have already been studied; antileukemic activity (37) and antitumoral activity have been reported (38) . Although, the present studies do not directly address the metabolic aspect of ibogaine, we found that ibogaine's effects on cocaine mechanisms were more dramatic in the later hours. Too, the studies by Dzoljic, Glick, and Sershen point to a study of the possible metabolites of ibogaine, as deserving. Along these lines, it is interesting that the dimeric Vinca alkaloid vinblastine, the well-known antineoplastic agent, undergoes metabolic transformation to iboga by the human serum copper oxidase ceruloplasmin, using chlorpromazine as the shuttle oxidant (25) . On the other hand, the dimeric Vinca alkaloid, leurosine, consists of an Iboga substructure which oxidizes to 15-hydroxycatharine (32) . Thus, further study on the active metabolites of ibogaine is importantly underway (44) .",

Critical though to ibogaine's manipulation of cocaine effects on biogenic amines and behavior is that the cocaine response had to be habituated for ibogaine to be effective.
