In 1982, rotavirus group B was recognized as a human pathogen when it caused epidemics of gastroenteritis in China (9) . An interesting observation in the Chinese epidemics was the more common occurrence of illness in adults rather than in young children. Rotavirus group B has been detected sporadically in Australia, Brazil, and the U.S., and there is serological evidence that rotavirus group B has infected people in Southeast Asia (1) . However, significant rotavirus group B gastroenteritis has not occurred outside of China. Because rotavirus group B is a common diarrheal pathogen in swine, and has a segmented genome similar to that of influenza viruses (and is even grouped alphabetically like influenza viruses), phenotypic changes due to reassortment of the swine rotavirus group B genome could (or perhaps can in the future) have facilitated the ability of the swine virus to infect humans (1) .",

            "text": "Historically, rotavirus has been de-tected directly in stool specimens by EM. Specimens can be homogenized and diluted, negatively stained with phosphotungstic acid, and examined. Two reasons that this relatively simple and sensitive (albeit expensive) technique is still considered by some workers to be the standard method for detecting rotavirus are the large amount of virus shed in stools and the often relatively bacteria-free (clean) state of rotavirus-elicited stools. The EM technique requires the presence of > 106 virus particles/g feces for optimum sensitivity. In a technique known as immune electron microscopy (IEM), convalescent antirotavirus serum can be mixed with rotavirus purified from specimens and examined by EM. The resulting aggregates of virus are usually easily observed and exclude irrelevant particles with morphology similar to that of rotavirus. In addition, the method can provide information as to the serotype of the virus. Some workers have coated EM grids with Staphylococcus aureus protein A, adsorbed rotavirus-specific antiserum to the protein, and used these grids to serotype rotavirus (11, 121. Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and latex agglutination (LA) are more commonly used to detect rotavirus in stools than is EM because the former methods are considerably less expensive and labor-intensive, and do not require special equipment. EIA is probably at least as sensitive as EM. In addition, the large amount of antigen in rotavirus-elicited stools is usually ample for detection. Several commercial rotavirus E1A (both monoclonal and polyclonal antibody-based) and LA kits are available. The literature is replete with interproduct comparisons as well as comparisons of products with EM (4, 13, 14) . Reported sensitivities and specificities of EIA kits range from 50 to 100% and from 71 to 98%, respectively. Re-ported sensitivities and specilicitic,, ot LA kits range from 61 to 96+~ and from 72 to 100c~, respectively. Scnsv tivities and specificities appear to depend on the studied patient population (both are highest in neonatest and on the standards to which the products arc compared (EM or other kits).",

Nationally, there was a demand for regulatory action, and the American politicians were only too anxious to respond. The federal Medical Waste Tracking Act of 1988 (Luken Bill) was passed and many, often restrictive, state laws followed. The race was on to save the nation from the \"evils\" of infectious waste.Hospitals and other medical facilities have been caught in a crossfire which threatens to add considerably to the already skyrocketing costs of medical care. Attempts to apply principles of logic and scientific evidence to arrive at reasonable approaches to managing medical wastes are being thwarted by extreme application of the NIMBY (not in my backyard) principle. We are left with a hodgepodge of inefficient, environmentally unsound, and sometimes outright ridiculous practices in place of sensible solutions. For example, some two-thirds of American hospitals are currently incinerating their wastes onsite. Many of these incinerators are old, inefficient,",
