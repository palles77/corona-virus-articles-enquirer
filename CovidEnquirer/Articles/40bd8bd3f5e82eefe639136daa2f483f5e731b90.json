The effects of SARS and human deaths from Avian Flu are compared directly according to the number of human deaths. The nature of the short run and long run relationship is examined empirically by estimating a static line fixed effect model and a difference transformation dynamic model, respectively. Empirical results from the static fixed effect and difference transformation dynamic models are consistent, and indicate that both the short run and long run SARS effect have a more significant impact on international tourist arrivals than does Avian Flu. In addition, the effects of deaths arising from both SARS and Avian Flu suggest that SARS is more important to international tourist arrivals than is Avian Flu. Thus, while Avian Flu is here to stay, its effect is currently not as significant as that of SARS.",

            "text": "Two diseases with their genesis in Asia, namely the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (hereafter SARS) epidemic, which received worldwide attention in 2003, and the H5N1 Avian Influenza (hereafter Avian Flu) epidemic (see, for example, http://www.uninfluenza.org/node/79), which has received worldwide attention since 2004, have significantly damaged the image of international tourism to Asia as a safe tourist destination. According to the World Travel and Tourism Council (2003a,b,c,d) , the outbreak of the SARS disease led to the collapse of the tourism industry in the most severely affected Asian countries, namely China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Vietnam. SARS is estimated to have cost these four countries over US $20 billion in lost GDP, and a reduction of more than 70% across the rest of Asia, even in countries that were totally disease free (Mckercher and Chon, 2004) . Table 1 presents the number of SARS infections, deaths and the death to infection ratio worldwide in 2003. As shown in Table 1 , 8096 people worldwide were infected by the potentially fatal SARS disease, while 774 deaths were caused by SARS. Of the 8096 infections, 7783 (or 96%) have occurred in Asia and only 313 (or 4%) in the rest of the world. Moreover, 729 (or 94%) human deaths have been caused by SARS in Asia, while only 45 (or 6%) human deaths have arisen in the rest of the world. China has accounted for the greatest number of SARS infections and deaths arising from SARS, followed by Hong Kong. However, Malaysia has the highest death ratio at 40%, while Thailand, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and the Philippines have a death ratio in excess of 10%. Table 2 presents the Avian Flu spread and infections worldwide from December 2003 to July 2007. As shown in Table 2 , Avian Flu epidemics were initially detected in East and South-East Asia, and were subsequently spread worldwide. For Avian Flu confirmed in humans, Vietnam was the first country to report data in both human infections and human deaths to the World Health Organization (WHO). The cumulative number of infections of Avian Flu worldwide was 319, with 192 human deaths from Avian Flu. Of the 319 human infections, 279 cases (or 87.46%) have occurred in Asia, while 40 infections (or 12%) occurred in Africa. This is similar to the number of deaths in humans, with 176 deaths (or 92%) in Asia, and only 16 deaths (or 8%) in Africa.",

Their results suggested that the numbers of infected cases have a significant impact on SARS-affected countries, but not on Avian Flu-affected countries. However, they used univariate time series models rather than efficient panel data methods, as used in this paper, their sample used only four countries for SARS and two Avian Flu-infected countries, whereas our data set is considerably more expansive in terms of the number of infected countries and human deaths.",

However, some infected countries may not report truthfully the precise number of outbreaks of Avian Flu in humans to the WHO (either through delays in reporting, or simply with holding the correct figures) because of the likely adverse effects of such reporting on the image of a safe tourist destination. On the other hand, most SARS-infected countries should be monitored more carefully by the WHO, as the transmission routes through direct person-to-person contact is of serious concern.",

In short, SARS had a significant negative effect, so it had to be controlled immediately. However, as the potential risks and damage arising from Avian Flu, and the subsequent pandemic influenza, is possibly much greater than for any previous diseases, the need for precautions in the event of an outbreak of Avian Flu and pandemic influenza warrants further attention and action.",
