(C) Polysome profiles from HEK 293T cells in the absence of arsenite treatment (left panel) and cells incubated with 0.5 \u00b5M sodium arsenite for 30 min. and allowed to recover for another 60 min. Cell lysates were fractionated on 7-50% sucrose density gradient. (D) Northern blot analysis of transiently transfected HEK 293T cells after arsenite treatment. Cells were treated with 500 \u00b5M sodium arsenite for 30 min. at 48 hours post transfection and allowed to recover for the indicated times.(E) Northern blot analysis of transiently transfected HEK 293T cells after VSV infection for 6 hours. Basic oligopeptides are found in many ribosome ligands and ribosomal proteins. Ivanova et al.",
