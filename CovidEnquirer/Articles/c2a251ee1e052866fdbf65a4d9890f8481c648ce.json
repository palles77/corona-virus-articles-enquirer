We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis in HCT patients with HMPV (n \u00bc 23) or respiratory syncytial virus (n \u00bc 23) detected in bronchoalveolar lavage samples by reverse transcription PCR between 2006 and 2011 to determine disease characteristics and factors associated with outcome. Mortality rates at 100 days were 43% for both HMPV and respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory tract disease. Steroid therapy, oxygen requirement >2 L or mechanical ventilation, and bone marrow as cell source were significant risk factors for overall and virus-related mortality in multivariable models, whereas the virus type was not. The presence of centrilobular/nodular radiographic infiltrates was a possible protective factor for mechanical ventilation. Thus, HMPV lower respiratory tract disease is associated with high mortality in HCT recipients. Earlier detection in combination with new antiviral therapy is needed to reduce mortality among HCT recipients.",

HMPV occurs with a seasonal pattern in the general population every winter and spring. Both HMPV and RSV cause similar symptoms in immunocompetent children and adults and are impossible to distinguish on a clinical basis [1] . HMPV infections can cause severe and even fatal disease in immunocompromised patients [2, 3] , with crude reported mortality rates from HMPV pneumonia ranging from 10% to 80% in different small cohort studies of cancer and/or hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) patients [3] [4] [5] [6] . To date, however, no study has directly compared lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) associated with HMPV with that of RSV in immunocompromised patients. Although the treatment and outcome of RSV LRTD in HCT has been relatively well studied and standardized [7, 8] , few data are available on the impact of HMPV LRTD during the time surrounding HCT. The purpose of this study was to characterize the clinical and radiographic presentation, viral load, and factors associated with outcome of HMPV pneumonia in HCT candidates and recipients and compare results with RSV pneumonia.",

One-step RT-PCR reaction mixtures (TaqMan One-Step RT-PCR Master Mix, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) were prepared using primers and probes targeting HMPV A/B and an internal control or RSV A/B and an internal control as previously published [13] . The reactions were performed and analyzed in a 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) under the following conditions: 30 minutes at 48 C and 10 minutes at 95 C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 seconds at 95 C and 1 minute at 60 C. Sera extractions were performed using the QIAamp RNA Mini Kit (Valencia, CA) as previously reported and provided a sensitivity of 200 copies/mL for a cut-off of 10 copies per reaction [14] .

Kaplan-Meier survival estimates for patients with HMPV or RSV LRTD according to steroid dose are shown in Figure 2B . In several multivariable models that adjusted for cell source, oxygen requirement, and steroid use, the virus type (RSV versus HMPV) was not a significant factor for mortality. Steroids at the time of diagnosis of LRTD (adjusted HR, 4.1 to 7.9), peripheral blood stem cell or cord blood as cell source (adjusted HR, .15 to .21), and oxygen requirement > 2 L or mechanical ventilation at diagnosis (adjusted HR, 3.6 to 4.6) were significant risk factors in multivariable models.

Asymptomatic shedding of HMPV from the upper respiratory tract was reported previously, indicating that not all infections with HMPV necessarily result in severe LRTD [15] [16] [17] . Studies have shown that 27% to 41% of HMPV upper respiratory tract infection progress to LRTD, but the outcome of LRTD is poorly described [18] . We compared recent cases of RSV and HMPV LRTD based on RT-PCR results of BAL samples with evaluation of diagnostic test performance, clinical and radiographic presentation, and factors associated with poor outcome. Our study found an overall similarly poor outcome of HMPV and RSV pneumonia and identified use of steroids as an important factor associated with outcome. Given the virologic similarities of RSV and HMPV, it is not surprising that clinical outcomes are similar between these viruses. However, in this study nearly all cases of RSV pneumonia were treated with ribavirin, whereas only onehalf of patients with HMPV pneumonia received treatment. Comparison of outcomes between treated and untreated patients with HMPV LRTD in this nonrandomized, retrospective review did not show any benefit of the drug. This is possibly related to the increased time to treatment observed in patients with HMPV LRTD compared with RSV LRTD, the potential for more aggressive therapy in sicker patients, and the shorter time between transplantation and HMPV diagnosis in the treated group of patients with HMPV LRTD compared with the untreated group. We adjusted for possible confounders such as the degree of acute lung injury (measured by the degree of oxygen requirement) and analyzed ribavirin use as a time-dependent variable to account for difference of the start time of the drug between patients. Nevertheless, the nonrandomized nature of the treatment remains a key limitation.",

However, no clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate treatment of HMPV LRTD in HCT. Initiation of treatment at the earlier stage of upper respiratory tract infection for RSV infection has been shown to improve the outcome and reduces the progression to LRTD [7] . The only prospective randomized study in immunocompromised patients showed a decline of RSV viral load and progression to LRTD, but the study was ended prematurely and statistical significance was not reached [21] . HMPV infection has similar rates of progression to LRTD and similar mortality compared with RSV, suggesting preemptive treatment at earlier stages might potentially be useful. New antiviral drugs are needed for both RSV and HMPV, and prospective studies are needed to examine whether preemptive therapy at the upper respiratory tract infection stage is effective in preventing progression to LRTD.",

However, we identified steroid treatment, stem cell source, and need for oxygen or mechanical ventilation as significant predictors for death. Steroids were primarily administered for nonpulmonary graft-versus-host disease treatment. Identifying steroid treatment, particularly high-dose steroid treatment, as a major risk factor for death might help target patients for interventions, including rapid steroid taper or antiviral treatments, in the future. Viral pneumonia in HCT recipients typically presents with small, poorly defined centrilobular nodules, tree-in-bud opacities, ground-glass opacities, and consolidation [24, 25] . These patterns can be present in various amounts in viral pneumonia, including HMPV and RSV [26, 27] . Our study, which represents the first comparison of RSV and HMPV viral pneumonia in HCT, documented similar radiologic features for both infections. As previously reported, ground-glass opacity and centrilobular nodules were very common in RSV (68% and 59%, respectively) and HMPV LRTD (59% and 36%, respectively). Tree-in-bud infiltrates were less common (18% for both viruses). A significant proportion of patients also demonstrated alveolar consolidation (64% for RSV and 68% for HMPV), corresponding to more extensive damage on histologic examination [28] . Our study correlated radiographic appearance with outcome demonstrating trends for better survival in patients with centrilobular nodules and worse prognosis in patients with ground-glass infiltrates, which represent a more diffused disease. In addition to detection of viral RNA in serum, this information could be useful in managing patients and identifying those who could benefit from therapy. Viral RNA was detected in the sera of one patient with HMPV LRTD and two patients with RSV LRTD; all three died of severe disease, a correlation previously suggested in an earlier study [14] . We speculate that detection of viral RNA in serum samples could become a useful tool to predict or stratify the likelihood of short-term survival in patients with HMPV or RSV LRTD. Larger studies are needed to address this question.",

Use of corticosteroids, stem cell source, and oxygen requirement at baseline and thereafter were associated with poor outcome. The association of poor outcome with high steroid doses suggests a possible intervention (ie, tapering steroid dose if clinically possible). This should be studied prospectively. Although this is the largest series of HMPV LRTD in HCT recipients, the effect of ribavirin could not be conclusively determined because of small sample size and confounding effects that led to the use of the drug. However, initial results did not suggest a major effect. Larger studies are needed to examine the effects of current and future treatment options optimally in a randomized fashion.",
