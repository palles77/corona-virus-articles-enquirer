This seems to be due to the fact that their limbs are splayed forwards or sideways as a result of muscular weakness (Thurley, Gilbert and Done, 1967) . In consequence, these newborn pigs are unable to go and suckle. Moreover, constant contact with the floor rapidly leads to necrosis of the skin overlying pressure points. The final result is an unacceptably high neonatal mortality and increasing financial loss to the pig industry.",

The most consistent change is the presence of a so-called myofibrillar hypoplasia (Thurley and Done, 1969) , in which the sarcoplasm is partly filled with glycogen instead of with contractile elements (Bradley, Ward and Bailey, 1980) . However, myofibrillar hypoplasia also has been found in many clinically unaffected newborn pigs (Bradley et al., 1980; Lukas, Pivnik, Straka, Rampochova, Stephanova, Kaman and Vitouch, 1982) . The term congenital myofibrillar hypoplasia therefore should not be used as a synonym for porcine splayleg. Some authors have described degenerative changes in the muscles of newborn pigs with splayleg (Bergmann, 1976; Zelena and Jirmanova., 1979) , but others have failed to detect any digenerative lesions (Bradley et al., 1980; Bucek, Lukas, Pivnik and Kaman, 1982) . The descrepancies in the literature reflect the obscurity of the pathogenesis of this syndrome.",

Histochemical and enzyme-histochemical examination of muscles yielded the following results. Succinic dehydrogenase activity was slightly higher in splayleg muscles. Acid pre-incubated ATPase activity was high in type 1 muscle cells and low in type 2 muscle cells.

These considerations led the authors to select carefully a strain of sows producing MFH negative pigs for the present study [ Fig. 1 (a) ]. Newborn pigs from these sows were compared with newborn pigs with splayleg by histoche-mica1 and cytochemical techniques in order to study the differences in their muscles. This study indicated that, in addition to MFH, several other differences were present in the muscles of the 2 groups of animals (group A-C).

These glycogen stores can be influenced by the feeding level of the sow (Ojamaa, Elliot and Hartsock, 1980) . Large muscle glycogen stores are therefore a normal finding in pigs at birth (Campion, Fowler, Hausman and Reagan, 1981) . The newborn pig is a much more mobile animal than the newborn rat and it has almost no other energy reserves but glycogen at birth (Yen et al., 1982) . It is therefore to be expected that glycogen in the newborn pig will be mobilized even faster than in the newborn rat. Some observations made in the present study support this hypothesis. Indeed, in the control group the amount of glycogen was already significantly reduced at 24 h after birth. Furthermore, in the experimental group the glycogen levels in the EMS were low and glycogen was concentrated in autophagolysosomes. In the pigs with splayleg, however, glycogen still filled the EMS at 24 h after birth.",
