One thing successful scientists do-regardless of how experienced-is to rehearse key points for upcoming conversations and practice their talks. For presentations in particular, practicing aloud, rather than silently, enables you to speak clearly, pronounce terms correctly, avoid stumbling through difficult terminology, adjust your pacing, and make smooth transitions between major points. Even if you do not have time to practice the whole talk-and with a busy schedule, it is often difficult to find the time to rehearse a standard 45-minute presentation over and again-it is essential to rehearse what you are going to say in the opening few slides.",

This may be achieved using a number of strategies, including the following. Convey enthusiasm. Enthusiasm is infectious and can inspire an audience to listen carefully, become engaged in a topic, and begin to share your interest. Feeling genuine excitement about your research is a good beginning. It can be projected into your conversations and presentations through the careful use of voice (e.g., changing your intonation), facial expressions (e.g., opening your eyes wider when conveying an interesting result, smiling), and body movements (e.g., leaning forward when making an important point).",

You will observe what is working well and identify what you can do to improve. For example, any mannerisms you have that can be distracting for an audience-such as obsessively pacing back and forth, frequently interjecting certain words or phrases into your talk (e.g., \"OK?\" and \"um...\"), or excessively highlighting items with your laser pointer-will become immediately apparent.

The vocabulary that you use and the degree of detail and level of complexity that you present should depend on your audience. With homogeneous groups, you can assume a higher level of understanding and can use more of the jargon associated with that field because people will understand what you're saying and will expect you to \"speak their language.\" If, on the other hand, you are addressing an audience from diverse scientific and technical backgrounds, it is important to describe things in basic terms, explaining details clearly and using analogies that will be familiar to most people. This applies if you are addressing interdisciplinary teams, broad scientific conferences, the media, or the general public. I often give presentations to colleagues from many disciplines. When speaking about concepts that span a range of scientific fields, I describe them in general terms. By aiming for a basic level, I am confident that my message will reach everyone; during the question period, I can focus on discipline-specific details and nuances.",

There are several approaches to e-mail communication (as there are with letter writing), from informal greetings to more formal messages that provide updates to collaborators or accompany applications for employment. Similar to any form of communication, you do not want to overburden the recipient with long messages. Too many people send emails that go on and on and overwhelm the receiver. It is difficult to read such letters on the screen and inconvenient to have to print the message in order to digest it properly. When composing e-mail messages, therefore, it is a good idea to break up ideas into separate sentences or sections. Some people use different text colors or highlight sections in bold. Make sure that the subject line states exactly what the message is about-similar to a title in a presentation. Generally speaking, make your e-mail message concise. Do keep in mind for whom the message is intended; you may, for example, wish to balance the message with a short personal update if the recipient is a close friend. E-mail messages can also be an effective way of distributing agendas before meetings or when you are planning a long conversation over the tele-phone. As discussed in the chapter \"Time Stress,\" having written agendas for meetings-however informal-is a good strategy for keeping the conversations focused. They also make it easier to record important notes. Email enables you to communicate with a larger group of people by using distribution lists and copying multiple recipients on the message.

In order to have a successful career in an increasingly multidisciplinary world, you need to work carefully and diligently on projects that interest you and others (e.g., granting agencies, journal editors, other scientists) and invest time in building relationships with your scientific colleagues, i.e., you must be a team player. To develop an international reputation and increase the potential for collaboration, you need to establish not only a critical mass of people working with and for you, but also a critical mass of contacts (i.e., a strong, broad network). By attending different meetings, publishing and presenting your work, and participating in social functions, you will become better known, your contacts will increase, and, with them, your potential sphere of influence. You will make a greater impression on people when they meet you in person and see you in action. If they are impressed by your dedication and the quality of your work, they will be more inclined to suggest your name to other colleagues and you will attract even more collaborators. (The chapter \"Networking\" explores this topic in greater detail.)",

Surely he does not mean what he seems to be saying. Artistic expression is probably one of the most fundamental attributes of humans and a means of communication in itself. In fact, there are manifold ways that artists express themselves, usually defined by the art form itself: an exhibition, concert, theatrical performance, dance, book. Art is easily sharable because it \"speaks\" directly to our emotions, our sensations, and our thoughts. In this respect, science is different. It took a long time for science to become easily disseminated and communicated, even among scientists themselves, and it does not engage our emotions or sensations in the same way as art. It is the enormous difference in experiencing and communicating art-compared with science-that presents this apparent schism: assuming that communication is a basic characteristic of life within human society, it is this lack of scientific communication that is the \"antithesis of life.\" This has serious implications for society, for only the contribution of research-based knowledge to the discussion of some of the challenges facing the world and the effective communication of scientific discovery-to the lay public and policymakers-will enable science to influence the development of sound public policy.",

Lay audiences do not have the benefit of our training, nor our knowledge of the specialized language that we use when communicating with each other. Further, their interests often tend toward the practical, the common-sense applications of our word rather than the theoretical: \"So, what's in it for society, really?\" seems to be their main focus.

There is a degree of subject specialization and descriptive language that can hamper understanding.
