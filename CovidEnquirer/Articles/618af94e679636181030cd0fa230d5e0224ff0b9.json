            "text": "The vast majority of eukaryotic mRNAs are monocistronic (Kozak, 1987) . Unlike their prokaryotic counterparts, eukaryotic ribosomes tend not to initiate at internal methionine codons, and thus translation on a eukaryotic mRNA is usually limited to the open reading frame that follows the first AUG codon (Kozak, 1978) . Consequently, there are very few examples of coordinate synthesis of multiple protein products from individual eukaryotic mRNA species (Kozak, 1986) . There is an emerging class of eukaryotic mRNAs, however, that do encode multiple proteins, not by controlling where ribosomes begin translating but where they finish, either by the suppression of in-frame termination codons or by ribosomal frameshifting (Glare and Farabaugh, 1985; Mellor et al., 1985; Yoshinakaet al., l985a, 198%; Jacks and Varmus, 1985; Mooreet al., 1987; Jacks et al., 1987 Jacks et al., , 1988 Brierley et al., 1987) . In all known retroviruses, thepolgene (encoding the reverse transcriptase and integrase functions) lies downstream of thegag gene, which codes for the virus core proteins (Weiss et al., 1982) . Retroviruses arrange their gag and pal genes in one of three ways: in the same reading +rame, separated by a single termination codon; in different reading frames, with pal briefly overlapping gag in the -1 direction; or with a third gene (encoding the viral pro-tease, termed pro) between gag and poi and overlapping both (Varmus, 1988) . Despite these apparent blocks to continuous translation, all retroviruses initially expresspoi by first synthesizing a gag-pal (or gag-pro-pal) fusion protein that is later cleaved during virus assembly to yield the mature products, The ratio of this fusion protein to the product of the gag gene alone is approximately 1:20 (Weiss et al., 1982) . Yoshinaka et al. (1985a) first showed by direct amino acid sequencing that the termination codon separating the murine leukemiavirus (MLV) gag and pal genes is efficiently suppressed by a glutamine-charged tRNA. In vitro transcription and translation methods were then used to demonstrate ribosomal frameshifting during expression of the gag-pal protein of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) (Jacks and Varmus, 1985) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-19 and double frameshifting in the synthesis of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) gag-pro-pal protein (Jacks et al., 1987; Moore et al., 1987) . The genomic sequences of several other retroviruses indicate that they utilize one of these three strategies to express their pal genes (Varmus, 1988) .",

Radiolabeled amino acid sequencing and site-directed mutagenesis were used to localize the precise site of frameshifting in RSV RNA to the last gag codon, a UUA-leucine, and suggest that the -1 frameshift is mediated by the simultaneous slippage of two tRNAs, the UUA-reading tRNALeU and the one preceding it, by one nucleotide in the 5'direction. Certain other sequences will functionally substitute for the natural RSV sequence at the frameshift site, including the sequences A AAA AAC and U UUA AAC, which are suspected to be the sites of frameshifting in other retroviral RNAs.",

The heptanucleotides are shown in boldface type along with their neighboring sequences and the distance (in nucleotides) between the 3' nucleotide of the heptameric sequence and the 3' end of its overlap (as delineated by the first nucleotide of the O-frame termination codon). Sequences are grouped according to their final three nucleotides; these constitute a codon in the upstream (e.g., gag) gene. Two of these codons, UUA and AAC, have previously been identified as the sites of frameshifting (see text). Evidence that the entire heptanucleotide sequence may participate in the frameshifting reaction is presented in this report.

(The overlap regions are delineated on the 3' side by the termination codon of the upstream [e.g., gag] open reading frame and on the 5'side by the termination codon that demarcates the beginning of the downstream open reading frame [e.g., poll). As shown in Table 1 , several overlaps, including the gag/pa/ overlaps of RSV and HIV-l, contain the sequence U UUA (where the UUA is a leucine codon in the 0 frame). One of two other sequences, U UUU or AAAC, appears in each of the remaining overlaps (Table 1) . We have previously proposed that -1 frameshifting might occur at these sequences if the tRNAs reading the O-frame codons occasionally slipped back and paired with the codons in the -1 frame . In fact, amino acid sequencing has shown that two of these sequences, U UUA and A AAC, are the sites of frameshifting during HIV-l gag-pal and MMTV gag-pro expression (Hizi et al., 1987) , respectively, and the amino acid sequences are consistent with the proposed mechanism.",

This model is shown in some detail for the RSV sequence A AAU UUA in Figure 1 . In step i, normal translation delivers a ribosome to the final two codons of gag such that the UUA codon is in the ribosomal A site being read by tRNALeU. The nascent protein is carried by the tRNAASn reading the AAU codon in the P site. Simultaneous slippage of these two tRNAs by one nucleotide in the 5' direction leads to the conformation shown in step II, where both tRNAs are base paired to the mRNA in two out of three anticodon positions. This interaction is made possible by the A and U residues 5' to the AAU and UUA codons, respectively. Next, normal peptidyl transfer of the nascent protein to the tRNALeU and translocation of this tRNA to the P site brings the first pal-frame codon (AUA) tRNAAS\" carrying the nascent peptide (jagged line) and tRNALeU are shown bound to the gag-frame codons, AAU and UUA, in the ribosomal P and A sites (step I). Simultaneous slippage of the two tRNAs by one nucleotide in the 5' direction results in their complexing with the adjacentpoCframe codons, AAA and UUU, with base pairs (bars) in the first and second codon positions (step II). Normal peptidyl transfer and three-nucleotide translocation brings the next pal-frame codon, AUA, into the A site (step Ill), where it is decoded by tRNArre (step IV). Note that the slippage could also occur following peptidyl transfer and prior to translocation.",

Thus, the transframe protein encoded by GP-S RNA is readily purified using IgG-Sepharose (Nilsson et at., 1965) . The nucleotide sequence of the S'end of this hybrid gene is shown along with the translation in the gag frame (above the nucleotide sequence) and pal frame (below the sequence and in italics).

A mutation in the 5'-most U residue would impair the ability of the tRNALeU to slip back. Mutation of the following two U residues would change the O-frame codon and thereby specify a tRNA that would be less likely to slip back given a U at position -1. As shown in Figure 36 , mutation of any of these three U residues to any other nucleotide severely inhibits frameshifting efficiency. Translation of RNAs carrying these mutations results in undetectable amounts of the gag-pal protein ( Figure 3B ). Thus, -1 slippage of the tRNALe\" is k-rdicated. Frameshifting",

NC symbolizes no change in efficiency. Frameshifting efficiencies were calculated from the amount of radioactivity in excised ge! slices containing thegag and gag-polproteins after correction for differential methionine content. The estimates reflect data collected from at least three separate experiments. Blank entries indicate either that mutations were not constructed or that the nucleotide corresponds to the wild-type sequence. gag terminator was changed to a sense codon (positions +4 and +5 mutations and +6U), another stop codon (+6A), or was followed by a second stop codon (+7U), the observed frameshifting efficiency was unchanged (Figures 38 and 3C ). Note that those mutations that convert the gag terminator to a sense codon extend the gag open reading frame by 111 nucleotides (Schwartz et al., 1963) , resulting in a larger gag protein ( Figure 3B ). For at least one of these mutants (+6U), however, the site of frameshifting is unchanged, as determined from amino acid sequence analysis using a pGP-S derivative (see Mutations in Positions -4 thfoug~ a2 inhibit Frameshifting, and a Mutatf~~ Further Upstream Does Not The proposed model (Figure 1 ) stipu!ates that frameshifting on RSV RNA occurs while the tRNALeU is in the ribosomal A site and involves the simultaneous siippage of this tRNA and the P-site tRNAASn. These aspects of the model are most strongly supported by the reduction in frameshifting efficiency observed upon mutation oi the three A residues in positions -4 to -2. of these A residues to C (-4C, -JC, and -2C) reduces frameshifting efficiency from the wild-typo value of 5% to approximately 1% (Figures 36 and 3C) . The -2U mutation has a similar inhibitory effect. As with the inhibition caused by mutations in the run of U residues, we attribute these deleterious effects to the specification of a tRNA with a decreased probability of slipping back (position -3 and -2 mutations) or to the disruption of the site to which the tRNAASn normally slips (-4C).",

(tR?QAPhe would have three of three anticodon positions paired in the -1 frame on +3U RNA rather than two of three for tRNALeU on wild-type RNA.) Alternatively, frameshifting on the wild-type and all three +3 mutant RNAs might involve a specialized tRNALeU capable of decoding ail codons with the sequence UUN (where N can be any nucleotide). To distinguish between these possibilities, we placed the +3U mutation into pGP-S (see Figure 2A ) and determined the amino acid sequence at the frameshift site. The +3U-encoded transframe protein contains phenylalanine at position 11 followed by leucine at position 12 (encoded by thepol-frame codon UUA; not shown). Therefore, in the +3U mutant, frameshifting is mediated by a tRNAPhe. Other Retroviral Frameshift Signals Functionally Replace the RSV Signal The sequence at the end of the simian retrovirus type 1 (SRV-1) pro gene exactly matches the last seven nucleotides of RSV gag, except that the UUA codon is substituted with UUU (Table l) , the same substitution as in the RSV +3U mutant. Given the successful substitution by the presumed SRV-1 frameshift site, we next tested two other suspected frameshift sites, A AAA AAC and U UUA AAC (Table l) , for their ability to function in place of the natural RSV frameshift sequence. As shown in Figure 4 , frameshifting does occur on RNAs in which the last seven nucleotides of gag match these two sequences. The frameshifting efficiencies on these two RNAs are approximately 10% (Figure 4, lanes 2 and 3) . Converting the last residue of these heptanucleotide sequences from C to A causes a lo-fold reduction in frameshifting efficiency (Figure 4, lanes 4 and 5) . It is noteworthy that one of these mutations (lane 4) produces a run of seven consecutive A residues, yet the frameshifting efficiency is greatly reduced. This result argues that simple nucleotide redundancy is not sufficient to mediate frameshifting in this context and suggests that only certain A-site tRNAs may be competent to shift into the -1 frame. This point is strengthened by the failure of the final RSV mutant, one that replaces the RSV U UUA sequence with G GGG, to allow any detectable frameshifting (Figure 4, lane 7) .",

Based on the failure of two frameshift sites of MMTV to cause frameshifting in a novel genetic context (Jacks et al., 1967) , we have proposed that potential stem-loop structures located downstream of ali retroviral frameshift sites might also be required to achieve high-level frameshifting (Jacks et al., 1967 . To begin to assess whether these stem-loop structures are relevant to frameshifting, we constructed a series of plasmids harboring progressive truncations of the RSV Figure  54 .

However, the mechanism of frameshifting as it occurs in retroviral genes differs from those discussed above in that two adjacent tRNAs slip into the alternate (-1) frame. Thus, for RSV an A-site tRNALeU and P-site tRNAASn move from the last two gag codons into the pal frame, adopting a two-out-of-three base pair, anticodon-codon configuration. The requirement for at least two-of-three complementarity between the A-site tRNA and the -l-frame codon seems absolute since any change that disrupts the run of three U residues that determines this pairing abolishes frameshifting. The role of the tRNA reading the P-site codon at the RSV frameshift site, while important, is less critical. Mutations in the run of three A residues responsible for the 0 and -1 frame interactions of the tRNAASn lower the frameshifting efficiency by approximately 5fold, but the gag-pal protein is still readily observed. Consistent with the more relaxed P-site requirements is the presence of several different P-site codons in various retroviral frameshift sites while only three A-site codons are observed (see Table 1 ). Further mutagenesis experiments are needed to define better the requirements for the P-site codon-anticodon interaction.",

The stemloop could directly displace the ribosome from its O-frame alignment by interfering with normal tRNA translocation, effectively\"pushing\" the ribosome into the -1 frame. During frameshifting in the E. coli RF2 gene, an mRNA sequence upstream of the frameshift site binds a segment of 16s RNA (that which normally binds the Shine-Dalgarno sequence during initiation).

As shown above, all of the sequences necessary for high-level frameshifting are contained in a 147 nucleotide RSV RNA sequence. We have previously reported production of a transframe protein directed by a 50 nucleotide sequence derived from HIV-l . However, while we have observed frameshifting on these cassettes in two settings, we do not expect them to function equally well in all contexts. At least for RSV, RNA structure is critical for frameshifting, and a perturbation of that structure by new surrounding sequence would be expected to lower frameshifting efficiency. In fact, an alternative explanation for the poor efficiency of the E deletion mutant (rather than the tertiary interaction suggested above) is that the novel 3' sequence abutting the stem destabilizes the structure.",

The argument is strengthened by the presence of potential stem-loop structures (showing little primary sequence homology) downstream of all putative retroviral frameshift sites (Jacks et al., 1987, 1988, and unpublished observations) . However, experiments we have recently performed with HIV-1 indicate that this view may be too simplistic. In a series of constructs in which the HIV-l gag-pal sequences downstream of the frameshift site were replaced by heterologous sequences, we observed variable effects on frameshifting efficiency (Madhani et al., 1988) . In one case the efficiency was reduced approximately lo-fold, while in others (including specific stem-destabilizing mutations) it was not significantly different from that determined for wild-type HIV-l RNA (Madhani et al., 1988) . These results demonstrate that sequences downstream of the HIV-l frameshift site can influence frameshifting efficiency but also that highlevel frameshifting can occur at this site, at least in vitro, in the absence of an obvious downstream stem-loop structure.",

While these sequences occur much less frequently than would be expected from statistical considerations, they are found, in the correct reading frame, in many cellular and viral genes.

Three of these sites are present in the analogous position in three alphavirus genomes (Garoff et al., 1980; Rice and Strauss, 1981; Dalgarno et al., 1983) ; the fourth is located in the genome of tobacco etch virus (Allison et al., 1986) .
