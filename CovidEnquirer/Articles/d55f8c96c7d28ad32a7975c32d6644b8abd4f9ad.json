Immunopathol., Recombinant porcine interferon gamma (rPoIFN7) induced a dose-dependent inhibition of the cytopathic effect produced by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) challenge of both homologous and heterologous (bovine) cell lines. In addition, an antiviral effect of rPoIFN7 was demonstrable against the coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection of porcine epithelial cells and of pulmonary macrophages. A rabbit anti-PoIFN7 antiserum was prepared and shown to specifically neutralize the antiviral effects of natural and recombinant porcine IFN7 preparations. This antiserum could also neutralize recombinant bovine IFN7 but not recombinant human IFNT. These results suggest antigenic homology of porcine and bovine IFN~ but antigenic differences between these molecules and human IFNT.",

Adequate evaluation of IFNy for its potential use against viral diseases or as an immunomodulator was difficult mainly because of the paucity of purified material. Cloning and expression of DNA encoding bovine and porcine IFNs (Capon et al., 1985; Ceretti et al., 1986; Lefevre and La Bonnardi~re, 1986) , however, has enabled evaluation of their biological activities, particularly in the bovine species Babiuk, 1985, 1986; Czarniecki et al., 1986) . Briefly, recombinant bovine IFNy (rBoIFNT) was shown to inhibit viral replication, to exert antiproliferative effects in vitro (Czarniecki et al., 1986) and to modulate neutrophil and lymphocyte functions both in vitro and in vivo Babiuk, 1985, 1986) .",

This would confirm in part, the report of Yilma (1983) , who demonstrated that crude preparations of bovine, caprine, equine and porcine IFNy had antiviral activity on heterologous (ovine choroid plexus) cells. Furthermore, rHuIFNy can act upon porcine lymphocytes by stimulating their natural killing (NK) activity (Charley, unpublished data, 1988) . Cross-species reactivities have also been described for IFNa (La Bonnardi~re and Laude, 1981; Yilma, 1983) and for IFNfl (Czarniecki et al., 1986) .

With this in mind, we were able to demonstrate that rPoIFN~ affords significant protection against TGEV challenge in vitro. Coronavirus TGEV induces acute and fatal diarrheas in young piglets (Haelterman, 1972) and replicates in two different cell populations: enterocytes (Haelterman, 1972) and pulmonary macrophages (Laude et al., 1984) . We show that rPoIFN7 is able to protect both epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages from destruction by the virus (Figs. 1 and 2) . This antiviral activity of rPoIFN7 in TGEV-infected porcine epithelial cells is highly dependent upon the multiplicity of infection of the virus, in contrast to the activity of the porcine IFNc~ preparation. The differences observed between IFNa and IFN7 preparations may reflect different modes of action on porcine epithelial cells. In addition, it is probable that the non-recombinant IFNa preparation contained a number of different forms of interferons and it is conceivable that the differences in antiviral activity observed between the IFN7 and IFNc~ preparations may be due to possible synergies between different interferon subtypes within the non-recombinant preparations. Certainly, different interferons appear to have different receptors on cells (for example, see Branca and Baglioni, 1981) and synergies have been seen between human IFN~ and IFNy (Weigent et al., 1983; Seow and Thong, 1986) .",

Experiments with anti-HuIFN7 antiserum confirmed the absence of antigenic cross-reactivity between human and porcine IFN7. Conversely, antiserum to BoIFNy did not neutralize either HuIFNy or PoIFNT: this suggests the existence of immunodominant cross-reactive epitopes on rPoIFN7 which would induce the production of antibodies, whereas these determinants would not be immunogenic on rBoIFNy. Closer similarity between PoIFN7 and BoIFN7 than with HuIFN7 can also be seen in the degree of the sequence homologies between these three IFN molecules: rPoIFNT/rBoIFNT, 76%; rPoIFNy/rHuIFNy, 59%; rBoIFNy/rHuIFN7, 61% (McCracken, Genentech, U.S.A., personal communication, 1987) .
