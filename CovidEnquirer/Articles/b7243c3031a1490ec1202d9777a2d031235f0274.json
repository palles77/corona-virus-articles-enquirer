However, silica itself had a marked protective effect against MHV3 infection that was maximal when injecting 1 mg 2 hrs before virus infection. The protective effect of silica was observed in a number of inbred mouse strains that differ in their relative resistance to MHV3 infection. No viral titers were observed in the spleen and liver of mice which had received MHV3 plus silica, whereas high titers were observed in the virus-infected controls. Injection of silica caused a marked decrease in the number of esterase-positive macrophages in the peritoneal wash-out population, that may be compatible with the possibility that the cause of the protection is the depletion of target cells for the viral infection. This latter effect, however, was short-lived and 24-48 hrs after injection of silica, high numbers of esterase-positive cells were again observed. This may explain why only little protection was observed when silica was administered 2 days before virus infection.",

The strong tropism of this virus for macrophages is well established (2) . Thus, high virus titers after intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection are observed in the peritoneal wash-out fluid, presumably derived from viral replication in macrophages. We have, in addition, shown that MHV3 replicated to high titers in cultures of pure macrophages which are grown from mouse bone marrow using conditioned media (SCHINDLER, L. and KIRCHNER, H., manuscript in preparation).",

One way of blocking macrophage function in vivo is the injection of silica (1) and with certain viruses it has been shown that the injection of silica brakes antiviral resistance (24) . We have recently observed that injection of C. parvum caused a protection of mice against MHV3 infection (18) . Since C. parvum is known to activate macrophages (19) , we have speculated that macrophage activation may be related to antiviral protection. Therefore, we have attempted to brake the antiviral effect of C. parvum by injection of silica. These experiments were not successful, but, unexpectedly, we observed that silica had a protective effect against MHV3 infection by itself.",

In our studies, we have found C, parvum to be active against HSV infection when given several days before the virus. In contrast, protection against MHV3 was observed when C. parvum was injected on the day of virus infection (18) . The reasons for protection in the latter system were not understood, but one of the most prominent effects of C. parvum is the activation of macrophages (19) . Thus, we have made an attempt to reverse the protective effect of C, parvum by injection of silica, an agent known to be toxic for macrophages (1) . This approach unexpectedly has yielded the result that silica itself had a protective effect against MHV3. Again, the time relationship was such that silica protected when given close to the time point of virus infection.",

Perhaps this decrease was even more pronounced since the remaining positive cells by morphology were not typical macrophages and were only slightly stained. Our data may be -in contrast to the data of DuBuy (3) -still compatible with the conclusion that the protective effect of silica is caused by killing of the target cells for replication of MHV3. Depletion of esterase-positive cells after injection of silica was only short lived and after 24--48 hrs, high numbers of positively staining cells were found again. This result may explain why only little protection is observed when silica is injected 48-72 hrs before infection.",
