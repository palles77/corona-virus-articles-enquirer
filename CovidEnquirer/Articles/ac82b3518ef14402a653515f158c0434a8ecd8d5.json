Spinel thin films with a thickness of approximately 100 nm were obtained from the [(Ni x Mn 1-x ) 0.84 Cu 0.16 ] 3 O 4 films annealed at the low temperature of 380\u00b0C for 5 h, which enables their direct integration onto substrates having complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) readout circuitry. To obtain negative-temperature-coefficient films with reasonable performance through low enough temperature anneal process, Ni content has been systematically varied, and the film microstructure has been found to depend on the relative amount of Ni and Mn. A single phase of cubic spinel structure has been confirmed in the prepared films. The resistivity (\u03c1) of the annealed films decreases with increasing Mn 4+ /Mn 3+ value due to the hopping mechanism between Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ cations in octahedral sites of spinel structure. Although the temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of the annealed films has been decreased slightly with the increase of Ni content, good enough properties of the film (\u03c1 = 61.3 \u03a9\u2022cm, TCR = \u22122.950%/K in x = 0.30 film) has been obtained even with the annealing at rather low temperature of 380\u00b0C, thus enabling the direct integration onto substrates having read-out circuitry. The results obtained in this work are promising for applications to CMOS integrated microbolometer devices. \u204e Corresponding authors.",

Among them, vanadium oxide is the most widely used given its high temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR; >2.5%/K) and low-cost preparation methods [1, 2] .

Until now, nickel manganite based spinel thin films have been fabricated by various methods [5] [6] [7] [8] . Kong et al. fabricated Mn-Co-Ni-O (MCN) thin films by RF magnetron sputtering method [5] . Ji et al. also fabricated MCN thin films using laser molecular beam epitaxy technique [6] . However, these vacuum processes have the disadvantage of expensive process costs. Several groups including He et al. fabricated nickel manganite based spinel thin films using chemical solution deposition method, but it requires a relatively high annealing temperature [7, 8] . In previous study, we have also fabricated [(Ni 0.2 Mn 0.8 ) 1-x Cu x ] 3 O 4 (0.25 \u2264 x \u2264 0.40) thin films using the metal-organic decomposition (MOD) method, and demonstrated that the thin films have high absolute TCR values (>3%/K) and low resistivity (<50 \u03a9 cm) [4] . Although the TCR and resistivity outcomes are sufficient, it is not easy to apply them for use in an uncooled microbolometer because the annealing temperature is too high (450\u00b0C annealing temperature (\u2264400\u00b0C) for the direct integration onto a substrate having complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) read-out circuitry [9] .",

The elemental distribution of Ni, Mn and Cu ions at the surface of the annealed films was investigated by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI 5000 Versa Probe\u2122, ULVAC-PHI, Japan) using monochromatized Al K\u03b1 (1486.6 eV) X-ray source with a power of 25.3 W. The XPS spectra were obtained with the analyzer pass energy of 23.5 eV and the electron take-off angle was set at 45\u00b0. The beam diameter was 100 \u03bcm. The binding energies were calibrated based on the C1s peak at 284.8 eV. The resulting spectra were fitted with the Multipak software. Fitting was performed after Shirley background subtraction and XPS peaks were deconvoluted as Gaussian-Lorentzian components with specified binding energy value for each element. The formation of spinel structure was identified using Fourier-transform infra-red (FT-IR, Nicolet iS50, Thermo, USA) spectroscopy. The resistivity of the thin films was measured by the four-point probe system (VP75, DSF System, Korea) in a temperature range of 25\u00b0C to 85\u00b0C. 3 shows AFM images of film surfaces for different Ni contents (x = =0.2 and 0.4), which clearly demonstrates the drastic difference in surface morphology depending upon the Ni content. These results show that Ni plays an important role in improving the surface morphology by removing the net-like structures. Similar flattening effect of Ni addition has been reported: Mn doped ZnO thin film prepared by solgel spin coating formed a wave like nematic structure, while Ni doped ZnO thin film was flat [12] . Fig. 4 shows the FT-IR spectra of [(Ni x Mn 1-x ) 0.84 Cu 0.16 ] 3 O 4 thin films annealed at 380\u00b0C for 5 h.

            "text": "The XPS was used to study the valences and distributions of the Mn, Cu, and Ni ions in the spinel structure. Fig. 5(a) and (b) show the XPS spectra for Mn 2p 3/2 and Cu 2p 3/2 of a [(Ni x Mn 1-x ) 0.84 Cu 0.16 ] 3 O 4 (x = =0.25) thin film samples, respectively. The Mn 2p 3/2 peak was deconvoluted into three peaks of Mn 2+ , Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ at the corresponding binding energies of 641.0 eV, 642.3 eV and 644.0 eV, respectively [5] ; similarly, the Cu 2p 3/2 peak was deconvoluted into two peaks of Cu + and Cu 2+ at binding energies of 930.9 eV and 933.4 eV, respectively [15] . It should be noted that, as the Ni content increases, the ratio of Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ in the B sites approaches to unity. The conductivity is known to have maximum when the numbers of Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ are identical [18] . In other words, the resistivity tends to decrease when the ratio of Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ in the B sites approaches unity, which agrees well with our experimentally measured data shown in Fig. 6 . Fig. 7 shows the resistivity of [(Ni x Mn 1-x ) 0.84 Cu 0.16 ] 3 O 4 thin films annealed at 380\u00b0C for 5 h, as a function of temperature. As the temperature increases, the resistivity decreases, which is a typical characteristics of negative-temperature-coefficient (NTC) thermistor. Further, the resistivity decreases with the increase of Ni content in the films. In order to explain the electrical properties of NTC materials based on nickel-manganite, it is necessary to understand the small polaron hopping model as well as the surface morphology [7] . The electrical conductivity of nickel-manganite-based NTC materials is affected by carrier hopping between Mn 4+ and Mn 3+ ions at the B sites [16, 19] . Therefore, the dependence of the resistivity on the Mn 4+ /Mn 3+ values in Fig. 6 is due to the carrier hopping between Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ . As shown in Table 2 , Ni plays a role in controlling the ratio of Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ in B sites. The small polaron hopping model is expressed by the following equation [20] ,",

It was suggested by Elbadraoui et al. that electron conduction may also proceed via jumping between Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ ions on more distant B-sites through Cu + and Cu 2+ ions at the A-sites [10] . This process can be expressed as follows: [16] . Considering the fact that the Cu content does not show any meaningful trend as shown in Table 1 , however, we believe that this mechanism would not have a strong influence on changes in the electrical characteristics. An important factor with regard to the sensitivity of NTC films is the TCR value. The TCR value at 298 K (T) can be evaluated using the following equation [8] : Table 3 shows that the TCR of the annealed films decreased with an increase of Ni content (x) in the film, which shows the same trend to the change in T 0 and E a .",

It should be noted that the film surface seems non-flat for rather low Ni content (x = =0.2~0.35), while other samples show quite flat surface for higher Ni incorporation (x = =0.4). This difference in surface morphology, depending upon the content of Ni, can be clearly seen in the top-view FE-SEM images of the sample surfaces, as shown inFig. 2. Protruding net-like morphology was formed on film surfaces for rather low Ni content. As the Ni content increases up to 0.4, however, the net-like undulation disappears completely and the film surface gets flat.",

            "text": "Fig. 3 shows AFM images of film surfaces for different Ni contents (x = =0.2 and 0.4), which clearly demonstrates the drastic difference in surface morphology depending upon the Ni content. These results show that Ni plays an important role in improving the surface morphology by removing the net-like structures. Similar flattening effect of Ni addition has been reported: Mn doped ZnO thin film prepared by solgel spin coating formed a wave like nematic structure, while Ni doped ZnO thin film was flat [12]. Fig. 4 shows the FT-IR spectra of [(Ni x Mn 1-x ) 0.84 Cu 0.16 ] 3 O 4 thin films annealed at 380\u00b0C for 5 h. Three main peaks were detected at 513, 565 and 611 cm -1 [13,14], which confirms the formation of a single phase cubic spinel structure in all the samples. 513, 565 and 611 cm \u22121 peaks denote Ni-O bond on B sites, Mn-O bond on B sites and Mn-O(A 1g ) bond on A sites, respectively [14]. The XPS was used to study the valences and distributions of the Mn, Cu, and Ni ions in the spinel structure. Fig. 5(a) and (b) show the XPS spectra for Mn 2p 3/2 and Cu 2p 3/2 of a [(Ni x Mn 1-x ) 0.84 Cu 0.16 ] 3 O 4 (x = =0.25) thin film samples, respectively. The Mn 2p 3/2 peak was deconvoluted into three peaks of Mn 2+ , Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ at the corresponding binding energies of 641.0 eV, 642.3 eV and 644.0 eV, respectively [5]; similarly, the Cu 2p 3/2 peak was deconvoluted into two peaks of Cu + and Cu 2+ at binding energies of 930.9 eV and 933.4 eV, respectively [15]. Table 1 shows the percentage of each valence of Mn and Cu calculated from the integration of each deconvoluted peak. Mn 2+ content increases with increasing Ni content while Mn 3+ content decreases. The content of Mn 4+ increases from 8% at x = =0.20 to 19% at x = =0.25, and remained almost constant up to x = =0.40. Cu 2+ content decreases with increasing Ni content while Cu + content varies rather randomly. Cu + mainly occupies A-sites, while Cu 2+ takes on both A and B sites [16,17]. Ni 2+ , Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ prefer the occupation of B-sites while Mn 2+ does A-sites [16]. Moreover, the octahedral preferences of Cu 2+ , Ni 2+ , Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ are in the order of Mn 4+ > Mn 3+ > Ni 2+ > Cu 2+ , while Cu + and Mn 2+ have a high tendency to occupy A-sites [15]. According to these empirical rules, Cu + and Mn 2+ ions fill A-sites preferentially, and Cu 2+ ion (has lower priority for B-sites) then fills the remaining fraction of A-sites. On the other hand, B-sites are occupied by other cations (Ni 2+ , Mn 3+ , Mn 4+ , and excess Cu 2+ ). To calculate the cation distribution in AB 2 O 4 spinel film, the fraction of each cation for A and B sites should be quantified. For a given Ni fraction (experimental variable), the quantity of Ni, Mn, and Cu in [(Ni x Mn 1-x ) 0.84 Cu 0.16 ] 3 O 4 film can easily be calculated. For x = =0.2 as an example, simple calculation leads to Ni 0.504 Mn 2.016 Cu 0.480 O 4 , which shows the total amount of Ni, Mn, and Cu. Then, for multi-valence ions of Mn and Cu, the fraction of each valence cation can be calculated by multiplying the relative abundance measured by XPS (given in Table 1). For Mn, the quantity of Mn 2+ cation is calculated to be 0.872 (=43.23% %\u00d7 2.016). The quantity of other cations such as Mn 3+ , Mn 4+ , Cu + , and Cu 2+ can be obtained by similar procedure. Finally, the spinel film AB 2 O 4 should be filled with cations, based on empirical rules discussed above, as [Mn 2+ , Cu + , Cu 2+ ] ions for A sites and [Ni 2+ , Mn 3+ , Mn 4+ , Cu 2+ ] ions for B sites, respectively. For the A sites, the sum of three cations should be unity, while that for the B sites be two. Note here that Cu 2+ ions fill A sites that are not filled with Mn 2+ and Cu + . The remaining Cu 2+ ions then fill the B sites. Table 2 shows the calculated cation distribution in each prepared [(Ni x Mn 1-x ) 0.84 Cu 0.16 ] 3 O 4 (0.20 \u2264 x \u2264 0.40) thin films. It should be noted that, as the Ni content increases, the ratio of Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ in the B sites approaches to unity. The conductivity is known to have maximum when the numbers of Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ are identical [18]. In other words, the resistivity tends to decrease when the ratio of Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ in the B sites approaches unity, which agrees well with our experimentally measured data shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 7 shows the resistivity of [(Ni x Mn 1-x ) 0.84 Cu 0.16 ] 3 O 4 thin films annealed at 380\u00b0C for 5 h, as a function of temperature. As the temperature increases, the resistivity decreases, which is a typical",

Concurrently, the increase of Ni content has also led to the increase in the ratio of Mn 4+ /Mn 3+ close to unity, leading to the decrease in resistivity. This is because the Mn ions at the B sites have strong contribution to the electrical properties of the films by participating in hopping transport. Although the T 0 (from 2876 K to 2314 K), E a (from 0.2479 eV to 0.1995 eV), and TCR (from \u22123.196%/K to \u22122.571%/K) decrease slightly with the increase of Ni content x (from 0.20 to 0.40), the processing temperature could be reduced below 400\u00b0C, which enables the direct integration of the materials onto substrates having CMOS read-out circuitry.
