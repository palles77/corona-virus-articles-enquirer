Although the initial interaction of JCV with host cells occurs through direct binding of the major viral capsid protein (VP1) with cell-surface molecules possessing sialic acid, these molecules have not yet been identified. In order to isolate monoclonal antibodies which inhibit attachment of JCV, we established an immunoscreening system using virus-like particles consisting of the VP1. Using this system, among monoclonal antibodies against the cell membrane fraction from JCV-permissive human neuroblastoma IMR-32 cells, we isolated a monoclonal antibody designated as 24D2 that specifically inhibited attachment and infection of JCV to IMR-32 cells. The antibody 24D2 recognized a single molecule of around 60 kDa in molecular weight in the IMR-32 membrane fraction. Immunohistochemical staining with 24D2 demonstrated immunoreactivity in the cell membrane of JCV-permissive cell lines and glial cells of the human brain. These results suggested that the molecule recognized by 24D2 plays a role in JCV infection, and that it might participate as a receptor or a co-receptor in JCV attachment and entry into the cells.",

PML affects mainly immunosuppressed patients, such as those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or following organ transplantation, and has increased in prevalence with the spread of transplantations and AIDS. However, there is still no effective treatment for PML. The major target cells of JCV infection in the CNS are the glial cells, such as oligodendrocytes and astrocytes [1] . The first step in the establishment of JCV infection is attachment of the viral capsid to receptors on host cells.",

VP1, encoded by the late region of JCV, is the major capsid protein that forms the outer surface of the virion. It has been reported that recombinant VP1 derived from Escherichia coli or insect cells can form virus-like particles (VLPs), and exhibit cellular attachment and intracytoplasmic trafficking similar to those of JCV virions [2] [3] [4] [5] . In addition, VP1 has been reported to play a major function in the attachment of JCV to cells as the anti-VP1 antibody suppresses viral entry into cells and subsequent infection 0006-291X/$ -see front matter \u00d3 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.11.158 [5] . The cellular receptor molecule for JCV is unknown, but it has been reported to be an N-linked glycoprotein containing a2-6-linked sialic acids, based on the observation that a2-6-specific sialidase inhibits infection of glial cells by JCV. In addition, treatment of permissive cells with tunicamycin, which removes N-linked oligosaccharides, was shown to inhibit JCV infection in vitro [6] . These findings indicate that the interaction between the major structural protein VP1 and sialic acids is critical for JCV infectivity. However, non-enveloped viruses are unable to fuse with the cell lipid membrane bilayer, and their internalization is thought to require a specific entry receptor. Furthermore, it has been reported that infectious entry of JCV requires a ligand-inducible signal that is inhibited by genistein, a protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor [7] . The mechanisms by which JCV binds and enters host cells and the molecules involved are not yet completely understood.",

Development of the immunoscreening system. (A) Strategy of the immunoscreening system using a blocking antibody against JCV infection. BALB/c mice are immunized with the membrane fraction from the human neuroblastoma cell line, IMR-32 cells. The wells of a 96-well plate are coated with the membrane fraction of IMR-32 cells, and then incubated with monoclonal antibodies derived from immunized mice before addition of VLPs. The amount of bound VLPs to the IMR-32 membrane fraction coated onto the wells is quantified with anti-VP1 antibody, followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins and TMB reagent.

Although the viral genome was detected in various organs, such as the kidney, lymphoid tissue, lung, liver, and intestinal tract, the major target cells of JCV infection in the CNS are glial cells, such as oligodendrocytes and astrocytes [14, 15] . Therefore, we investigated the subcellular localization of the molecule recognized by 24D2 in the human brain. Positive signals for 24D2 were distributed in the glial cells of the cerebrum and cerebellum (Fig.  6A) . To confirm the cellular distribution of the immunopositive signals, we performed double immunofluorescence staining using 24D2 and cell-specific markers, such as CA2, as a marker of oligodendrocytes [16] [17] [18] [19] , GFAP, a marker of astrocytes, and synaptophysin, a neuronal marker (g-i) (Fig. 6B) . The immunopositive signals of 24D2 were colocalized with GFAP and CA2 (Figs. 6Ba-f ). However, 24D2 failed to react with synaptophysin-positive neurons (Fig. 6Bg-i) . These results indicated that the molecule recognized by 24D2 is distributed mainly in glial cells in the human brain.",

            "text": "Virus attachment to cell-surface molecules is an initial event in the process of virus infection. Many viruses utilize various receptors for attachment and entry into cells. The polyomavirus, simian vacuolating virus 40 (SV 40), binds to the MHC class I molecule at the cell surface [20] , but the MHC molecule is not internalized into the cells together with SV 40 [21] . The ganglioside GM1 also binds to SV 40, and is mediated to transport the virus from the plasma membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and a role of GM1 as a functional receptor has been suggested [22] . The mouse polyomavirus (PyV) is also known to bind to the sialic acid of an as yet unidentified receptor [23] . Efforts to identify the receptor by screening for monoclonal antibodies that can protect cells from infection have been unsuccessful [24] . It has been reported that an antibody to a4b1 integrin partially inhibits PyV infection [8] . Therefore, the integrin has been suggested to act as an entry receptor in the early stages of PyV infection in fibroblasts, and PyV utilizes gangliosides as carriers from the plasma membrane to the ER [22] . Interestingly, SV40 and PyV have been shown to use clathrin-independent and caveolin- dependent mechanisms to infect cells, respectively [25] [26] [27] . In contrast, JCV enters host cells by receptor-mediated clathrin-dependent endocytosis [28] . Furthermore, it has been reported that JCV does not share receptor specificity with SV 40 on human glial cells, because anticlass I antibodies failed to inhibit JCV infection [6] .",

The 60-kDa molecule recognized by 24D2 was detected not only in IMR-32 cells, but also in other cell lines, including the human kidney cell line, HEK293. In addition, 24D2 showed inhibition of cellular attachment and entry of FITC-VLP to HEK293 cells (data not shown). These results suggest that the molecule recognized by 24D2 also acts as a receptor in IMR-32 and HEK293 cells.

This smaller molecule might be an isotype or a proteolytic product of the larger molecule. It has been reported that a monoclonal antibody against the hyaluronan receptor recognized two distinct receptors in the cell membranes of rat liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, which were identified previously as hyaluronan-binding proteins of 175 and 300 kDa [34, 35] . After reduction of disulfide bonds, the 175-kDa hyaluronan receptor was shown to be a single protein, whereas the 300-kDa molecule consisted of three subunits, i.e., a (269 kDa), b (230 kDa), and c subunits (97 kDa) [35] , and it has been reported that the 175-kDa receptor was derived from the 300-kDa receptor by proteolytic processing [36] . Similar to the hyaluronan receptors, the molecules of 30 and 60 kDa recognized by 24D2 might be isoreceptors for the same ligand or products derived from a larger receptor complex. It has been reported that the receptor with 30-kDa molecular weight for human coronavirus OC43 was isolated from the newborn mouse brain membrane fractions [37] .

Positive immunoreactivity for 24D2 was colocalized with CA2-positive oligodendrocytes and GFAP-positive astrocytes, but failed to colocalize with synaptophysinpositive neurons. These findings indicated that the putative receptor molecule for JCV was localized mainly in the glial cells of the human brain. In the present study, the neuroblastoma cell line, IMR-32, was used as the immunogen for the monoclonal antibody because these cells are highly susceptible to JCV infection [38] . Furthermore, immunization of IMR-32 cell has been shown to produce an antibody that specifically recognizes a molecule in oligodendrocytes [39] . Thus, it was suggested that IMR-32 cells possess molecules in common with brain glial cells. In Fig. 6Aa and b, the immunopositive signals against 24D2 were less than those of Fig.  6Ba , d, and g. We suppose that the difference of oligodendrocyte 24D2 immunostaining patterns among Fig.   6A and B might be due to the applied immunostaining systems. In Fig. 6A , we applied the biotinylated antibody as a second antibody, and the sections were observed with light microscopy.

By a newly established immunoscreening system, we isolated a monoclonal antibody (24D2) that inhibits cellular attachment Fig. 6 . Subcellular localization of the molecule recognized by 24D2 in the human brain. (A) Immunoreactivity with 24D2 in the cerebrum (a) and the cerebellum (b). Arrows indicate the immunopositive cells (a,b) in the white matter. Scale bars, 50 lm. (B) Double immunostaining using 24D2 and anti-CA2 antibody (a-c), anti-GFAP antibody (d-f), or anti-synaptophysin antibody (g-i) in the cerebrum. The merged images show that the molecule recognized by 24D2 (red color) was colocalized with CA2 and GFAP (green color). However, colocalization was not detected between 24D2 and antisynaptophysin signals. Arrows indicate the 24D2-and CA2-double positive cells (a-c). Asterisks indicate white matter (g-i). Scale bars, 20 lm. and infection of JCV. We also showed that the antibody specifically recognizes a membrane molecule with a molecular weight of 60 kDa, and positive signals were observed in the glial cells of the human brain. These results suggest that the molecule recognized by 24D2 acts as a JCV receptor in JCV infection. Further studies are required to characterize and determine the functional role of the molecule. A greater understanding of the molecular characteristics of the receptor molecule is necessary for the design of novel anti-JCV agents. Experiments to identify the molecules detected by 24D2 using a k phage library are currently in progress in our laboratory.",

IMR-32 membrane fractions were coated onto each well of the immunoplates, which were preincubated with serial dilutions of 24D2 (m), mouse IgM (isotype control antibody, h), or without antibody (AE), and then incubated with 5000 HAU of VLPs (A) or JCV (B). Binding of VLPs or JCV was detected with anti-VP1 antibody and presented as the absorbance value. The bars represent the standard deviation of the mean of at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate.",

IMR-32 cells pretreated in the absence or presence of 24D2 or the isotype control antibody (IgM) were inoculated with 512 HAU of JCV for 1 h. Four days after inoculation, the cells were harvested and analyzed with immunoblotting using specific antibodies for JCV proteins (large T-antigen and agnoprotein). (A) Representative immunoblotting data with antibodies for large T-antigen and agnoprotein. Anti-actin antibody was used as a loading control. (B) Expression levels of viral proteins in IMR-32 cells treated with 24D2 or the isotype control antibody (IgM) relative to non-treated IMR-32 cells (control) at 4 days after inoculation of JCV. The bars represent mean values \u00b1 SD of at least three independent experiments. (C) The dose-dependent inhibition of JCV infection by 24D2. IMR-32 cells were incubated with different concentrations of 24D2 and incubated with 512 HAU JCV. JCV T-antigen and agnoprotein expression in IMR-32 cells was analyzed by immunoblotting 4 days after inoculation. The data are presented as amounts of viral protein expression relative to that of control infection. The assays were performed at least twice independently.",
