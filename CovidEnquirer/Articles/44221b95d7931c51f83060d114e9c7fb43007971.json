We investigated the ability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in 21 consecutive patients with clinically definite MS to produce interferons and lymphokines in response to viral or mitogenic stimulation. Ten patients showed clinical signs of disease activity (acute relapse) and 11 patients were in a stable condition. Additionally, white blood count, leukocyte differentiation and lymphocyte subtyping were performed. A group of age-related healthy blood donors served as control (n520). There was no difference between patients and controls in the production of IFN-g, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and soluble interleukin (IL)-2 receptor. IFN-a and IFN-b responsiveness, however, was significantly lower in patients with stable disease than in patients with active disease and controls ( p,0.001). Furthermore, secretion of IL-2 after stimulation was significantly diminished in both patient groups as compared to the control group ( p,0.01).",
