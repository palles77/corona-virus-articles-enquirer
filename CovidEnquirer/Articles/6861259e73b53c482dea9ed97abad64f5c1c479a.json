These pathogens became known after extensive surveys of bats following outbreaks. As a fi rst step in investigating unidentifi ed pathogens in bats and to help forecast the potential threat of emerging infectious diseases, we tried to isolate and characterize viruses that persistently infect bats. In the process, we isolated a novel adenovirus from a fruit bat in Japan.",

However, use of these antimicrobial drugs for treating community-acquired infections has led to an increase in FQ-resistant strains in bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. Group B streptococci (GBS, e.g., S. agalactiae) are the leading cause of invasive infections (pneumonia, septicemia, and meningitis) in neonates. GBS are also associated with bacteremia, endocarditis, and arthritis, and are responsible for deaths and illness in nonpregnant women with underlying diseases and in elderly adults (2) . We describe, to our knowledge, the fi rst GBS clinical isolate in France resistant to FQ; the isolate was from a patient treated with levofl oxacin.",

This patient was treated for 2 weeks with levofl oxacin, 750 mg/day, for acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. No other relevant respiratory bacterial pathogens were present in these samples. GBS CNR0717, a capsular serotype IV strain, was suspected to have reduced susceptibility to FQs because no inhibition zone was observed around disks containing norfl oxacin and pefl oxacin disks, and reduced diameters were observed around disks containing ciprofl oxacin and levofl oxacin. Antibiograms were performed according to recommendations of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (3) on Mueller Hinton agar (Bio-Rad, Marnes la Coquette, France) supplemented with 5% horse blood. This strain was susceptible to all other antimicrobial drugs usually active against GBS (penicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, rifampicin, vancomycin) and showed low-level resistance against aminoglycosides. MICs for 6 FQs ( Table) indicate that GBS CNR0717 was highly resistant to pefl oxacin and norfl oxacin, with MICs >64 mg/L, and showed increased MICs for ciprofl oxacin, sparfl oxacin, levofl oxacin, and moxifl oxacin. No reduction of FQ MICs was observed with reserpine (10 mg/L), which indicated that resistance to FQ was not caused by an active effl ux pump system. Three major mutations have been reported for FQ resistance in streptococci at codon positions 81 in gyrA and 79 or 83 in parC (4) . DNA sequence analysis of these regions showed a mutation in parC (Ser 79 \u2192 Tyr) but not in the wild-type susceptible strain (NEM316). No mutation was detected in the gyrA gene. FQ resistance in streptococci is acquired through a stepwise process and has been extensively studied in S. pneumoniae. First-step mutants conferring low-level resistance generally result from mutations in either gyrA or parC. There is also ",
