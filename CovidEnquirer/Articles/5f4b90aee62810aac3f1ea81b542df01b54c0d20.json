A 230-bp segment of the gene encoding for transmembrane protein M of CCV is the target sequence of the primer. The test described in the present study was able to amplify both CCV and TGEV strains and also gave positive results on fecal samples from CCV infected dogs. n-PCR has a sensitivity as high as isolation on cell cultures, and can therefore be used for the diagnosis of CCV infection in dogs.

Because it is sometimes difficult to differentiate CCV infection from infection caused by the more virulent canine parvovirus, it is important to be able to obtain a rapid etiological diagnosis in kennels experiencing an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis.",

Moreover, the PCR test allows the detection of denatured CCV in fecal samples.",

This is expected because CCV, FIPV and TGEV are closely related (Horsburgh et al., 1992) . n-PCR, with the primers CCV2 and CCV3, amplified both CCV and TGEV genomes, but not that of FIPV, thus revealing higher specificity than the conventional PCR.",
