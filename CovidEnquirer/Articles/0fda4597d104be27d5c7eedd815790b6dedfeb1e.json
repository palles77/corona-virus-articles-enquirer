This outcome suggests that air circulation due to the ceiling fan was sufficient and that any additional increase would not improve efficacy. Numerous experimental studies on upper-room UVGI in which fans were used to provide air mixing have been published. However, none have quantified the air movement produced by these fans or described their tests in sufficient detail to allow results to be compared to predictions using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The present work provides the required information. In addition to the usual boundary conditions needed for CFD, we made experimental measurements of UV susceptibility of the microorganisms used in the upper-room UVGI tests. We measured UV susceptibilities for Mycobacterium parafortuitum and Bacillus atrophaeus spores to be 0.074 and 0.018 m 2 /J, respectively. In a previous publication, we reported the spatial distribution of fluence rate, which is also needed for predicting efficacy from CFD. In a companion paper referred to as Part II, upper-room UVGI efficacy was predicted by both Eulerian and Lagrangian CFD and compared to the experimental results from the present study.",

It is particularly well suited for control of tuberculosis (TB), which is spread from person to person exclusively by airborne transmission [2] . Other diseases that are believed, at least in part, to be transmitted through the airborne route can also potentially be controlled by upper-room UVGI (e.g., common cold [3] , influenza [4] , severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [5] , and smallpox [6] ). In addition, upper-room UVGI can also reduce the concentration of airborne Bacillus anthracis spores, an infectious agent that has been used by terrorists [7] .",

In order to minimize UV radiation reaching the lower room where it is potentially hazardous to occupants, the fixtures utilize horizontal, closely spaced, deep louvers to collimate the UV beam and cause it to rise about three to five degrees from the horizontal. A concern with upper-room UVGI arises because the UV beam remains in the upper room and an infected person exhales infectious particles into the lower room. Thus, sufficient vertical air mixing is crucial for bringing infectious particles to the upper room where they are irradiated and inactivated and then returning the air to the lower room where it can be safely breathed by non-infected people. Recognizing that natural convection may not always provide a dependable source of vertical air mixing, NIOSH recommends the use of ceiling fans as a means to assure that vertical air mixing is adequate [8] .",

In addition to quantifying how much mixing is required for upper-room UVGI to be efficacious, this work was also designed to provide other researchers engaged in modeling upper-room UVGI using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), or other methods, with experimental data that they could use for validation of their simulations. Although numerous journal articles using CFD to predict the performance of upper-room UVGI have been published previously, experimental measurements of efficacy needed for validation have been very limited [9e12] . In addition, besides the usual boundary conditions required for modeling, such as room dimensions and supply and exhaust airflow rate and location, predicting upper-room UVGI efficacy requires knowledge of the UV susceptibility of the airborne organisms being inactivated and the UV fluence rate field in the upper room. UV susceptibilities were measured in the present study, and the UV fluence rate field was measured and modeled using a computer-aided design tool in a prior study [13] . Using all of this information, efficacy of upperroom UVGI was predicted using CFD and compared to the experimental results in a companion paper [14] .",

The nebulizer continuously produced 12 L/ min of bioaerosol. Fig. 1 . This detailed diagram is provided so that others can compare our experimental results with their predictions using CFD or other simulation methods. The chamber's walls and ceiling are lined with commercial plastic-coated panels, which have a reflectance at 254 nm of <10% (13) , and the floor is covered with 12 in. (200 mm) square vinyl floor tiles. A 6.25 in. (159 mm) wide, 97 in. (2.46 m) long, light fixture extending 5.5 in. (140 mm) down from the ceiling contained two 95 W tubular fluorescent lamps. The centerline of this fixture was parallel to and 18 in. (0.43 m) away from the right-hand long wall and nearly centered between the short walls (See Fig. 1.) The chamber has a dedicated computer-controlled heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) system that maintains the chamber at 70 F (21 C) and provides an air exchange rate of 6 h \u00c01 . Conditioned outdoor air flows through a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter and, as shown in Fig. 1 , then flows through a supply air grille and enters the chamber near the ceiling in the upper corner of a long wall. It exits through the exhaust air grille near the floor in the lower corner of the other long wall farthest from where the supply air enters, and then flows through a second HEPA filter prior to being exhausted outdoors high above surrounding buildings. In order to prevent exfiltration of contaminated air, the chamber is kept at a negative pressure of 0.01e0.05 in. w. (12. 5250 cfm (0.77, 1.4, and 2.5 m 3 /s) respectively, based on methodology published by U.S. EPA [16] . Further details for this fan are given in a companion paper [14] . We did not conduct experimental tests without a ceiling fan operating because upper-room UVGI efficacy may vary significantly depending on the amount of mixing caused by heat sources (such as people, computers, and radiators), HVAC systems, differences in indoor and outdoor temperatures, and wind velocity [17e19]. The test chamber contained two Hygeaire model LIND 24-EVO UV fixtures (Atlantic Ultraviolet Corp., Hauppauge, NY), which were mounted with their bottom surfaces at a height of 8 ft (2.4 m) above the floor. In Appendix A, a diagram of this fixture with dimensions is given in Fig. A.1 . Each fixture contains one 25-W tubular lamp with a parabolic reflector close to the lamp's backside. UV radiation exiting the fixture must pass between 2 ft (0.61 m) wide, 3 in. (76 mm) deep, horizontal louvers spaced 1/4 in. (6.4 mm) apart. The two fixtures were staggered so that they did not directly face each other. As shown in Fig. 1 , one fixture was mounted on one short wall and the other fixture on the other short wall, such that one side of each fixture was 2 ft (0.60 m) away from a different long wall. The UV emission rate of each fixture, which was 0.47 W, and the UV fluence rate field produced by these fixtures were measured in a prior study [13] .

For these conditions, if the air exchange rate is doubled, the airborne culturable bacteria concentration in the room will be halved. If there is also an inactivation process such as upper-room UVGI, the equivalent air exchange rate for UVGI can be defined as the additional increase in air exchange rate that would be necessary under the three conditions specified above to obtain the same viable airborne bacteria concentration without UVGI. For example, if the air exchange rate is 6 h \u00c01 and upper-room UVGI reduced the viable airborne bacteria concentration by a factor of four, a hypothetical air exchange rate of 24 h \u00c01 would result in the same concentration. Thus, the equivalent air exchange rate attributable to UVGI is the difference between this hypothetical air exchange rate and the actual air exchange ratedthat is, 18 equivalent air changes per hour.

This chamber had been used previously to measure the UV susceptibility of other bacteria and viruses [22e25]. The chamber and associated apparatus, which are shown in a schematic diagram in Fig. 2 , were located in a biological safety cabinet to minimize the possibility that aerosol would escape from the chamber into the room or that stray organisms would enter the chamber. The chamber is divided into two zones: 1) a mixing zone containing baffles to induce mixing and drying of the bacteria-containing droplets and 2) an exposure zone where bacteria are exposed to a known constant UV irradiance. Relative humidity and temperature were measured with an Omega RH32 m (Omega Engineering, Stamford, CT) at the exit of the mixing zone. Temperature and relative humidity averaged 70 F (21 C) and 59%, respectively. The top of the UV exposure zone, which is 51 mm high, 240 mm wide, and 280 mm long, is a window made of fused quartz, which is essentially transparent to UV radiation. A Lumalier UV fixture (Memphis, TN) containing six 36-W low-pressure mercury lamps was located 0.5 m above the quartz window. This UV fixture was turned on at least 15 min before sampling began in order to stabilize the UV lamps. The UV irradiance in the exposure zone was adjusted by attenuating the UV radiation with multiple screens placed between the fixture and the quartz window to attain the desired irradiance in the exposure zone. The irradiance within the exposure zone was measured at 30 equally spaced locations using a Gigahertz Optik model 3718-2 UV detector sitting on the floor of the exposure zone and a model P9710-1 optometer (T\u00fcrkenfeld, Germany). The exposure time (t) of bacteria to UV radiation was calculated from the volume (V) of the exposure zone and airflow rate (Q) through it:",
