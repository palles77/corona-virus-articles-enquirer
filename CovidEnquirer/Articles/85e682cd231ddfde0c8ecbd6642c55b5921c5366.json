Thus, at the household level, the effects resulting from individual-level factors, such as vaccination, may be confounded or modified in some way. We proposed the Bayesian hierarchical randomeffects (random intercepts and random slopes) model under the context of generalised linear model to capture heterogeneity and variation on the individual, generation, and household levels. It was applied to empirical surveillance data on the influenza epidemic in Taiwan. The parameters of interest were estimated by using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method in conjunction with the Bayesian directed acyclic graphical models. Comparisons between models were made using the deviance information criterion. Based on the result of the random-slope Bayesian hierarchical method under the context of the Reed-Frost transmission model, the regression coefficient regarding the protective effect of vaccination varied statistically significantly from household to household. The result of such a heterogeneity was robust to the use of different prior distributions (including non-informative, sceptical, and enthusiastic ones). By integrating out the uncertainty of the parameters of the posterior distribution, the predictive distribution was computed to forecast the number of influenza cases allowing for random-household effect.",

Specifically, it is of great interest to quantify the force of an infectious agent's spread and the associated factors. However, it should be noted that data on the transmission of pathogens during an epidemic period have inherent multilevel structures, from the individual, through the household, then finally to the community, using the transmission of influenza as an example. Moreover, when it comes to the evolution of the same epidemic wave infectious process across generations can also be treated as a separate level. Correlations between generations and across hierarchical levels make intractable the elucidation of the spread of infectious disease based on conventional probability models. Because the transmission of pathogens at the community level is so different from that at the household level, it is therefore interesting in the study of some infectious diseases, such as influenza, to model the transmission mode based on household data before applying the model to community data.",

Stemming from the chain binomial model, Becker's proposed linear logistic models allow for the escape probability that depends on relevant covariates of interest (such as the number of exposed infectives and generations) [1] . Alternative methods of modelling the transmission of diseases using household data with final size distributions have been proposed [2] [3] [4] . Using such an approach, Longini and Koopman estimated the escape probability of influenza within a household [2] . House and Keeling applied deterministic dynamic models to demonstrate the effects of strategies targeted at an individual or household while considering the heterogeneity of different household sizes [5, 6] . By applying the methods analogous to the branching process, Ball et al. extended the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model to incorporate two types of mixing patterns (within-group and between-group transmission) and demonstrated that a control strategy should take into account certain heterogeneities, such as households [3, 7, 8] . The two separate model parameters pertaining to infection rates underpinning 2-level mixing epidemic model have been estimated by a data augmentation method using the entire at-risk population [9, 10] proposed by Demiris and O'Neill or sample data proposed by O'Neill [11] .",

Although the use of a final size distribution alleviates the difficulty of identifying the temporal order of the onset of the disease, it may lose information on the generation time effect when data on the evolution of the epidemic wave are available. Namely, these models dispense with the need for classifying household cases as the same episode and explicitly model within and between household infections. Cauchemez et al. proposed a Bayesian approach to elucidate the transmission of influenza within households using prospective follow up data on the disease onset in households but accurate temporal information on the onset of the disease is not available [12] . Note that the majority of these models put emphasis on the threshold of epidemic based on the estimation of reproductive number with and without considering the containment of infection control, particularly universal vaccination. While these statistical models under the context of the SIR model are well developed for quantifying infectious process so as to evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies of infection control by using the estimated reproductive number the perspective of their application is at population (macro) level. Their models, although still workable we suppose by using the multi-type extended models for example [9] [10] [11] , have been barely extended to model the heterogeneity of multilevel levels making allowance for correlation within each level.",

            "text": "To this end, we extended Becker's framework to accommodate data on such a hierarchical structure. Levels of susceptible individual, generation, and household were considered as a unified analytical framework under the context of generalised linear random-effect models [13] . Such a typical example can be noted in the O'Neill et al. study [14] that extended the flexibility of the Becker model by using the random household effect models in conjunction with the MCMC method to model the escaped probabilities at community and household level each of which was specified by a statistical distribution to account for the heterogeneities of the levels. Although their approach has advanced in the Becker model it still leaves room to be desired and may have several extensions. First, the mechanisms of disease transmission such as the Greenwood model [15] and the Reed-Frost model [16] originally proposed by the original Becker's framework can be incorporated to make the model biologically plausible. Second, the heterogeneity of escape probability across households (socioeconomic status) and individual attributes (such as age and sex) can be also taken into account by using the random-intercept model. Third, allowing for regression coefficients to vary with different levels can be accommodated by using the random-slope model. The classical example of this situation is that the effect of vaccination on protecting individuals from disease vulnerability should also consider contextual factors, such as the heterogeneity of socioeconomic status across households, which have been confirmed as significant factors in previous studies [5, 6, [17] [18] [19] [20] . In spite of the attractiveness of these random-effect models, it should be noted that considering the effect and variation across different levels increases the number of parameters and makes estimation of parameters intractable from the viewpoint of statistical computation. The most serious problem is the problem of identifiability between parameters already noted in the O'Neill study [14] . To tackle these statistical technique problems, we resorted to the application of Bayesian underpinning together with the two transmission models.",

We constructed hierarchical models with the following levels: subject, generation, and household. Correlations and contextual effects were modelled as the parameters of random intercepts and random slopes in the model. The MCMC method, in conjunction with the Bayesian directed acyclic graphical (DAG) model, was utilised to derive posterior distributions for the parameters of interest. The rest of this article is organised as follows. In Section 2, we demonstrate the application of our model to surveillance data on an influenza epidemic. Section 3 presents the Becker model and the proposed Bayesian hierarchical models based on the Greenwood and Reed-Frost transmission models. Following the Becker method, the logistic regression form was used to accommodate the effects of factors at an individual level. Section 4 describes the procedures of parameter estimation and model building, including the elicitation of prior distributions, Gibbs sampling, and model selection. The results of the analyses, as well as the predictive distribution and estimated effects of vaccination by the elicitation of informative priors to incorporate prior knowledge on the effects of vaccination, are presented in Section 5, and we conclude with a discussion.",

            "text": "Our intention in constructing Bayesian hierarchical models was motivated by the multilevel data structure of the observations of the influenza epidemic within household information. Between July 2001 and March 2002, Taiwanese surveillance data were collected to cover the yearly period of seasonal influenza [21] . Data on whether subjects developed influenza-like symptoms were derived using the National Health Insurance database. Cases of influenza were identified according to clinical diagnosis by a physician in the form of International Classification of Disease, 9th Revision, clinical modification (ICD-9-CM) codes 487 (influenza), 487.0 (influenza with pneumonia), 487.1 (influenza with respiratory manifestations), and 487.8 (influenza with other manifestations). Information on the characteristics of the subjects, such as age (divided into three groups: less than or equal to 6 years, \u08d965 years, and 7-64 years), sex, vaccination status, and date of diagnosis were also collected. Household information was identified by linking the current empirical data with the nationwide household registration database of Taiwan, thus providing a unique identification number for each household. Following the definition of the Becker model [1] , the first case in a household, identified by the date of diagnosis, was classified as the introductory case. Subsequent cases within the same household that had intervals between successive dates of diagnosis \u08d87 days were classified as cases of subsequent generations, and the other household members free from influenza moved to the next generation [22, 23] . Cases within the household diagnosed on the same day were classified as cases within the same generation. If the interval between successive dates of diagnosis was >7 days, the case was classified as the next episode (wave) of an epidemic. Data used for further analysis were confined to subjects with household sizes ranging from two to five with at least one case of influenza. The subjects used for estimating the parameters of the models were derived from a random sample of 10% of the households providing data.",

In addition to the characteristics of each susceptible subject, such as age, sex, and vaccination status, the environmental contexts of each household, including environmental crowding, the social network, and socioeconomic status, are thought to affect the spread of disease. This effect can result in variations of the baseline risk of contracting influenza between households, as has been observed in previous studies and was further modelled using a random household effect [1, 24, 25] . Aside from the correlations between subjects within each household, heterogeneity exists between generations as an epidemic evolves. Such a generation effect has been previously modelled in the Becker model [1] and was also observed in the work of Fraser et al. [26] during the H1N1 strain epidemic. Variations within the joint effects of factors at the individual level and at the household level represent the heterogeneities inherited from these subpopulations. In addition to variation in the baseline risk of contracting influenza across households, the effect of the influenza vaccine, which should be evaluated after the implementation of a risk-based vaccination project including the voluntary uptake of vaccine, may also vary from household to household due to the interaction between the environmental contexts and the effects of vaccination at the individual level. This variation should also be taken into account.",

Transmission probabilities change across households and generations and vary between individuals with different characteristics. The nested relationships between levels are also observed. As a result, a multilevel structure occurs in our data on the influenza epidemic, and the source of this variation arises from levels that should be jointly evaluated in combination with relevant factors at an individual level. As mentioned above, we are motivated by this intuition to construct Bayesian hierarchical models to accommodate these correlational structures while preserving the mechanism of transmission (such as the Greenwood model and the Reed-Frost model) by which disease spreads within households to analyse the collected data.",

Becker [1] proposed a linear logistic model allowing for the escape probability, depending on the relevant covariates of interest. Let t act as a non-negative integer denoting the generation of the evolution of infectives within a household, with introductory cases belonging to generation zero. Let Y tj indicate whether a susceptible subject escaped from disease after being exposed to j infectives in the generation t \u2212 1, acting as a Bernoulli random variable with the parameter q tj . The Bernoulli parameter represents the escape probability indicated by number of exposed infectives j and generation t, and the probability of being vulnerable to disease, p tj , is 1\u2212q tj . The logistic form log{(m tj q tj )/[m tj (1 \u2212 q tj )]} = \u03b1 t + \u03b2 t \u00d7 j was adopted in Becker's generalised linear model [1] , with m tj denoting the number of susceptibles exposed to j infectives in generation t \u2212 1. The effects of generations and the number of infectives on the escape probability were thus assessed by the model. The Greenwood model [15] , which assumes the risk of being infected for susceptible subjects is independent of the number of infectives (saturated infection), is equivalent to reducing \u03b1 t to \u03b1 and specifying \u03b2 t as zero. On the other hand, the Reed-Frost model [16] asserts that the event of escaping infection when exposed simultaneously to two infectives is equivalent to escaping infection when exposed to one infective in each of two successive occasions and depicts the transmission mechanism of close contact, which is equivalent to reducing \u03b2 t to \u03b2. Applying Becker's generalised linear model to our data, we are able to incorporate factors at an individual level alongside the generation level and the exposed number of infectives in the model to evaluate their combined effects on the risk of susceptibility to influenza.

To show the differences among Becker's linear logistic model, the Bayesian hierarchical model with random intercepts, and the latter model with random slopes, we illustrated these three models using estimated results based on the Greenwood model with a generation effect by simulating the logit predicted values of the vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects of ten households and by controlling for covariates at the subject level, considering ages between 6 and 65 years and females. there was no variation between households, and 10 lines overlapped (Fig. 3, first column) . The intercepts of the logit-predicted values increased from \u22122.81 in the first generation (Fig. 3 , first column and first row) to \u22122.02 in the fourth generation (Fig. 3 , first column and fourth row), showing that the risk of being vulnerable to influenza increased as the epidemic evolved. In the random-intercept model based on the Greenwood model (Fig. 3, second column) , the trend of increasing the risk of being vulnerable to influenza with successive generations was preserved, and the spread of the logit-predicted values of the ten simulated household are shown as parallel lines due to the \u03b1 0h term in the model specified in (4), which represents the heterogeneity in the baseline risk of being vulnerable to influenza across households and the contextual effect. Regarding the Greenwood model with a random slope (Fig. 3, third column) , the variation between households shows the effect on the slope (\u03b2 0h , model specified in (8)), representing the interaction between the effect of vaccination and the contextual effect. Moreover, it is notable that the heterogeneity in the slope is much greater than that of the intercept after separating the generation effect from the baseline risk. ",

This quantity moved away from zero using the random-slope model, incorporating the interaction between the effect of vaccination and the household-level context and was estimated as \u22120.63 to \u22120.69, with a corresponding odds ratio of 0.53 to 0.50 (Table 4 , third and fourth columns). To summarise, the Bayesian hierarchical model with random slopes based on the Reed-Frost model with a generation effect incorporating random variation across households into the effect of vaccination (random slope) is the model with the lowest DIC value (405,300, Table 5 ). The next-best model is the random-intercept Bayesian hierarchical model with a generation effect based on the Reed-Frost model (405,641, Table 5 ). Details on simulated posterior samples of parameters, including autocorrelation plots, correlations between parameters, and effective sample sizes, are provided in Appendix C.",

The Bayesian hierarchical model has been used to cope with the heterogeneity found in longitudinal follow-up studies characterised by multilevel structures [30] [31] [32] . The flexible framework of the Bayesian hierarchical approach makes it feasible to model data with complex structures. O'Neill et al. proposed the model's use for partially observed household and temporal data by applying the MCMC method to incorporate the concept of random infectiousness and random susceptibility in the model [14] . Methods on data augmentation for the longitudinal household data of influenza outbreaks, such as the MCMC simulation, were also developed, although the problem of convergence when estimating parameters was noted and was coped with alternative MCMC algorithm [14] . This problem may result from issues of identifiability, mainly for the parameters pertinent to the two escaped probabilities from household and community. Following the Becker model [1] , we extended the method of analysing infectious disease data with household structures by making use of the Bayesian hierarchical approach to tackle correlated features between observations. The proposed method provides a framework using random effects underpinned by a generalised linear model to address the dependent data for infectious diseases within a household. This is tantamount to the application of the Bayesian hierarchical model to address the issue of overdispersion, partly due to the multilevel structure and partly to the dependent property of the data.",

Male sex and old age groups showed lower probabilities of being vulnerable to influenza. As the epidemic evolved, the probability of contracting influenza was higher. The vaccination effect was not significant in Becker's linear logistic models or in the Bayesian hierarchical random-intercept models, whereas the protective effect of vaccination was statistically significant in the random-slope Bayesian hierarchical model. The difference in the risk of being vulnerable to influenza between males and females is very likely reflective of differential exposure to influenza infections. Regarding the differences observed among the age groups, the lower risk associated with the elder group and the higher risk associated with the younger group are consistent with the observations of Cauchemez et al. [24] and may be due to a history of previous exposure to the influenza virus that may confer a protective effect. The inverse relationship between the size of households and the probability of being influenza cases listed in Table 1 was also observed in several studies [24, [37] [38] [39] . Although the trends of proportion of influenza cases by household size vary from study to study, possible factors such as the proportion of child [24] , contact pattern, hygiene behaviour, ventilation status [40] , and difference in social network pattern [39] implying the heterogeneity across households may contribute to the observed pattern.",

A descriptive analysis of our data by the sizes of households also shows such variation (Fig. 2) , prompting us to apply hierarchical models with random effects. Similar findings on variations across households were also observed by Cauchemez et al. [24] in their work on the pandemic of influenza. The work of House and Keeling also demonstrated that heterogeneity across households should be considered before implementing preventive strategies [5] . From the history of modelling infectious disease data, incorporating generation effects and variation across households are two approaches that have been found to be useful in improving the performance of models [1] due to their allowing for heterogeneity, which accounts for overdispersion. This approach is also supported by the fundamental theories of infectious diseases [41] , which indicate that the delineation of the process of the spread of infectious disease between hosts will be fruitful only after the cluster effect arising from environmental contexts has been considered. Although the previous work on the methods of modelling the epidemic of influenza within households tackled the relevant difficulties, such as latent epidemic chains [2, 3, 14] and partially observed infectious processes [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] 14] , the approach of quantifying such heterogeneity has been barely addressed. The proposed Bayesian hierarchical framework on modelling infectious disease data also provides an approach to test the significance of random-effect parameters by comparing the DIC values between models. In our proposed models, both parameters of the random intercept (\u03b1 h ) and the random slope (\u03b2 h ) significantly improved the fitting of Becker's linear logistic model. After including a generation effect, which partially accounts for the baseline variation in the risk of contracting influenza, the improvement observed in the models with random intercepts diminished substantially in terms of DIC values. The comparison between the Bayesian hierarchical models with generation effects and random intercepts and those with random slopes shows that heterogeneity can be further addressed by considering the random-slope parameter, which reveals significant variation in the effect of vaccination across households. Significant improvements in model-fitting statistic in terms of DIC values were noted after incorporating a generation and random effects, as noted in Table 5 . Among our Bayesian hierarchical models, the model with best performance in terms of DIC values was the random-slope model based on the Reed-Frost model with a generation effect, suggesting the existence of random variations on the effect of vaccination across households. Meanwhile, the probability of being vulnerable to influenza increased with respect to generation. The superior performance of the Reed-Frost model compared with the Greenwood model was also observed in Table 5 because the number of exposed infectives also increased the risk of being vulnerable to influenza during the spread of influenza within the households.",

In general, the DIC values of models with random-effect (random-intercept or random-slope) were reduced in comparison with the counterparts of the fixed-effect. This is entirely attributed to the lower value of Dbar of the random-effect model when compared with the counterpart of the fixed-effect. However, including the random effects in the model also led to the reduction in degree of freedom resulting from the complexity of the model. Such a penalty is represented by the higher value of pD of the random-effect model in comparison with the counterpart of the fixed-effect. The penalty of the elevated pD was offset by the gain of reducing Dbar. The net gains gave the support of random-effect models.",

However, considering the interaction between the effects of vaccination and the contextual effects of households, the estimated effect of vaccination using the Bayesian hierarchical models with random slopes departed from zero, with odds ratios of approximately 0.50 to 0.53. This paradox, when evaluated together with the low proportion of vaccination (4.1%, Table 1 ) and the voluntary nature of being vaccinated within the target population reveals the possibility that the significant protective effect of vaccination observed only in models with random slopes was due to the contextual effects of households, such as their socioeconomic statuses. Vaccination therefore represents a proxy for this context, which shows its effect in terms of interaction. In their work based on a survey of nationally representative samples in the United States for patients aged 18 and older, Galarce et al. [18] reported that receiving the influenza vaccine is associated with sociodemographic factors and other factors, such as urbanisation and influenza-related beliefs. Similar findings on the differences in receiving an influenza vaccination among people across socioeconomic strata have also been noted in Taiwan [19] . In addition to variation in receiving the influenza vaccination, the effect of the socioeconomic gradient on influenza was revealed in the work of Stone et al. [20] . Discrepancies between the vaccination rate and the risk of infection were also disclosed in the work of Gu and Sood [42] . These studies suggest possible links between socioeconomic factors, influenza vaccination, and the risk of being vulnerable to influenza. Using Bayesian hierarchical models with random slopes permits meaningful estimation of the vaccination effect across the level of households (\u03c3 \u03b2 h ), which quantifies this linkage in the form of an interaction. Additionally, the outcome used in our analysis was the clinical diagnosis of influenza as observed among individuals seeking medical consultations, which may also be subject to the socioeconomic status of each household.",

Based on the results of our prediction, the trends of the spreading infectious disease can be assessed, and a decision on the proper allocation of resources can be better made. For a prediction that more accurately reflects the progression of an epidemic, observable relevant factors, as well as unobserved variables, should be incorporated into the model. The Bayesian hierarchical approach has the advantage of incorporating unobserved variables, such as contextual effects and socioeconomic status, into the model in the form of random effects; therefore, it is able to provide a predictive distribution based on the current data, making use of the posterior estimates. The comparison of predictive distributions between the models presented in Fig. 4 shows the benefit of including random slopes into the model. The prediction using the Bayesian hierarchical model with random slopes based on the Reed-Frost model with a generation effect provides a precise result that is close to the observed value, with a narrow 95% CI range in the overall group and the unvaccinated group. Although the predicted result in the vaccinated group may be compromised, the ranges of the 95% CIs cover the observed values and can act as foundations upon which the extent of the epidemic may be assessed. The random-effect parameter on vaccination (\u03b2 h ) provides the flexibility to account for heterogeneity across households. The low vaccination rate and the predominance of unvaccinated subjects in most of the influenza cases resulted in the predicted number of cases being largely influenced by the unvaccinated group, even after adjusting for age, sex, and heterogeneity across households.",

When the non-informative prior was used, the posterior distributions reflected the weight of evidence based only on the data, whereas the elicitation of the informative prior provides an approach to evaluating the parameter of interest based on different prior beliefs that can be updated by the current data. The estimated results of the effect of the vaccination shown in Table 6 , using the enthusiastic prior and the sceptical prior, illustrate this approach. Considering movements both towards and away from the null and the effect of vaccinations, the posterior estimates provide results informed by the data. The weighting factors of the prior belief and the data are the inverses of their variances. In our case, the inverse of the variance of the prior distribution dominates the information derived from the data and shifts the estimated effect of vaccination towards the prior belief.",

Still, the MCMC method does not guarantee convergence or proper mixing during the sampling process. Reparameterisation is often required to improve performance [43] . Additionally, it is time consuming to generate sufficient posterior samples upon which inferences can be made; this process may be adversely affected by reparameterisation. This is especially true when applying hierarchical models to our empirical data and using households as cluster effects. Although the proposed method is flexible in accommodating the correlations across levels in data with hierarchical structures, identifiability was still unavoidable for certain parameter. Correlations of the posterior samples of parameters between the individual level and the generation level were observed for the effect of vaccination (\u03b2 00 ) and the random effect (\u03c3 \u03b2 h ), as illustrated in the scatter plots of models in Appendix C (Figs. C.2.3.1-C.2.3.4). To consider the correlation between \u03b2 00 and \u03c3 \u03b2 h , we applied the normal-inverse-\u03c7 2 (NIC) method to model the joint effect of the two parameters [44] . The joint prior distribution p(\u03b2,\u03c3 2 ) is defined in terms of the marginal prior distribution for \u03c3 2 and the conditional distribution of \u03b2 given \u03c3 2 , specifically, p(\u03b2,\u03c3 2 ) = p(\u03c3 2 )p(\u03b2|\u03c3 2 ). The model specification based on the Greenwood model and the Reed-Frost model with a generation effect alongside the estimated results using sceptical prior are given in Appendix D in the supplementary material. Except for the standard deviation parameter (\u03c3 \u03b2 h ), estimated result for the effect of vaccination were robust to different prior distribution chosen (Table 6 and Table D in Appendix D).",

Several iteration algorithms including longer thinning intervals, running multiple chains, and longer iterations were explored with the estimated results and effective sample size listed in Tables E. 1-E.4 in Appendix E in the supplementary material. Although the effective sample size varied with these sampling algorithms, the estimated results were consistent. Moreover, the results based on three chains with different initial values proposed by Gelman et al. [43] also led to consistent estimates (see Figs. E.1 and E.2 in Appendix E). In addition to applying Gibbs sampling algorithm, we also explored the effective sample size, estimated results, and acceptance rate using rejection sampling (Tables E.5 and E.6 in Appendix E). The estimated results for parameters using rejecting sampling algorithm were consistent with those using Gibbs sampling. The results based on 5000 burn-in and 5000 iterations with a thinning interval of three were thus reported due to the consistency in the estimated results of these updating strategies. Based on these explorations, we think the estimation of some parameters of interest may be affected by high correlation but this issue can be ameliorated by longer simulation and validated by multiple chains and different sampling algorithms.",

However, the nature of monitoring the disease status rather than the infectious status of the surveillance should be noted before making inference base on the results. The estimated secondary attack rate was lower than studies based on prospective design [24, 45] . Although the secondary attack rate within household raged from <4% to >30% depends on the definition of case and area of study [46] and also determined by viral strain and household structure, the lower estimates of the secondary attack rate may associate with the selection of only subjects diagnosed as influenza rather than those with respiratory symptoms. Also, the identification of influenza cases relies on subjects with influenza seeking for medical consultation which may also contribute to the lower secondary attack rate. The use of clinical definition also introduces another source of variation, since virus such as parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, bacteria, and other untypable virus may also cause ILI [47] . These underlying variations in the causative agent for ILI may contribute to the deviation between the predicted and observed number of cases presented in Fig. 4 . Although nationwide laboratory surveillance network was unavailable until the year 2003 [48] , recent studies showed the positive rate for influenza among subjects with ILI was around 22-27% and may reach 50% during epidemic [49, 50] . They also indicated the parallel trend between reported ILI cases and the number of isolated influenza virus. These findings, together with the result of studies on the association between ILI and influenza infection [51, 52] support the use of ILI as a proxy variable for the surveillance of number of isolated influenza virus.",

Such a multi-type epidemic model considered local contact as well as global contact. Both are integrated into data augmentation scheme [9] [10] [11] . It is therefore worthwhile to make allowance for information on both local and global contact with our proposed Bayesian hierarchical model as considered in the O'Neill work [11] if such hierarchical data either with temporal outcome or final size outcome or a mixture of both at different population structures are available.",

However, our information is based on temporal data rather than final size outcome it is not sure whether the similar finding will be obtained as in the O'Neill work. The finding on the inverse relationship between the precision of estimates for threshold parameter and the sampling fraction from the O'Neill study [11] would spur us to investigate this issue in the future using samples of temporal individual and household data together with information possibly available from different hierarchical population structures (e.g. schools closures).",

The models are also capable of taking dependent structures inherited from data on influenza epidemics into account to address the problem of overdispersion when constructing probability models. Although Becker's linear logistic model is capable of testing the Greenwood and Reed-Frost models, it cannot fully account for the characteristics of infectious disease data mentioned above. Hierarchical models with Bayesian underpinnings are one solution to such correlated data with multilevel structures. Applying the proposed Bayesian hierarchical models to the empirical data used to monitor the influenza epidemic demonstrates that the parameters on the individual, generation, and household levels can be derived based on inferences made using the MCMC method in conjunction with DAG. The Bayesian hierarchical models are also capable of uncovering the interactions between contextual effects, such as socioeconomic status and vaccination, to elucidate their joint effect on the occurrence of influenza. The Bayesian approach is beneficial to the incorporation of prior knowledge on the effect of relevant factors and to the derivation of predictive distributions to assess the evolution of epidemic processes.",

The random-intercept model based on the Greenwood model resulted in the reduction of the DIC value by 328 compared with the Greenwood model of the fixed-effect model. A corresponding 269 reduction in the DIC values was noted for the Reed-Frost model. With respect to the Bayesian hierarchical models with random slopes, the model based on the Greenwood model reduced the DIC values by 318 compared with the fixed-effect model based on the Greenwood model. A corresponding reduction of the DIC value by 278 was noted in the comparison between models based on the Reed-Frost model. However, the reduction in the DIC value by including the random intercept parameter in the models already containing the generation effect was modest (34 for the Greenwood model and 80 for the Reed-Frost model). This finding suggests the significant contribution of generation effect. The comparisons between the fixed-effect models and the random-effect models demonstrate the significance of including random-effect parameters (viz., \u03c3 \u03b1 h and \u03c3 \u03b2 h ) to improve the conventional probability model by taking the heterogeneity between households into account when tackling the phenomenon of overdispersion. Considering a random slope for generations in the model reduced the DIC value further (211 for the Greenwood model and 341 for the Reed-Frost model) compared with the model with random intercepts. This result suggests that the heterogeneity accounting for the overdispersion in modelling the process of the influenza epidemic lies mainly in the variation of the effects of vaccination across households, after including the generation effect in the model.",
