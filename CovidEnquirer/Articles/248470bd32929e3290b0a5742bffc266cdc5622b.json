SARS-related stigma, despite its salience for public health and stigma research, has had little examination. This study combines survey and case study methods to examine subjective stigma among residents of Amoy Gardens (AG), the first officially recognized site of community outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. A total of 903 residents of AG completed a self-report questionnaire derived from two focus groups conducted toward the end of the 3-month outbreak. Case studies of two residents who lived in Block E, the heart of the SARS epidemic at AG, complement the survey data. Findings show that stigma affected most residents and took various forms of being shunned, insulted, marginalized, and rejected in the domains of work, interpersonal relationships, use of services and schooling. Stigma was also associated with psychosomatic distress. Residents' strategies for diminishing stigma varied with gender, age, education, occupation, and proximity to perceived risk factors for SARS such as residential location, previous SARS infection and the presence of ex-SARS household members. Residents attributed stigma to government mismanagement, contagiousness of the mysterious SARS virus, and alarmist media reporting. Stigma clearly decreased, but never completely disappeared, after the outbreak. The findings confirm and add to existing knowledge on the varied origins, correlates, and impacts of stigma. They also highlight the synergistic roles of inconsistent health policy responses and risk miscommunication by the media in rapidly amplifying stigma toward an unfamiliar illness. While recognizing the intrinsically stigmatizing nature of public health measures to control SARS, we recommend that a consistent inter-sectoral approach is needed to minimize stigma and to make an effective health response to future outbreaks. r",

The origins of stigma toward health conditions are complex. According to existing theories, a combination of interactive elements may bring about stigmatization. Briefly stated, they include perceived threat, information processing bias, selfinterest, negative labeling, social communication of bias, exclusion, status loss, and power difference (Haghighat, 2001; Link & Phelan, 2001; Stangor & Crandall, 2000) . Illnesses that are associated with more of these elements are conceivably more likely to be stigmatized.",

SARS is a novel infectious disease that broke out in Guangdong, People's Republic of China, before March 2003, progressed to involve 29 countries globally, and subsided in June the same year. Early in the epidemic, there were widespread fears that SARS would propagate uncontrollably, overwhelm public health resources, create global economic disasters, and kill millions of people. Media reports suggest that stigma and discrimination related to SARS were common in many domains of everyday life, such as the workplace, schools, health services, restaurants, and shopping malls. The perceived linkage between SARS and ethnicity led to the irrational avoidance of Asians (especially Chinese) in many parts of the world. Many countries likewise imposed excessively stringent restrictions on travelers from Asia (Moy, 2004; Singer et al., 2003; Stocking, 2003) .",

Being the first officially recognized site of the community outbreak in Hong Kong, this high-rise housing estate exhibited a disturbing toll of 329 confirmed cases of infection and 42 deaths (Hong Kong Government, 2003) . Specifically, although AG consists of 19 separate blocks, 41% of its confirmed cases of infection and 52% of deaths occurred in Block E alone.

SARS has been portrayed as highly contagious, controversial in transmission, ''incurable'', and conducive to serious sequelae of treatment (Meltzer, 2004) . Unsurprisingly, scattered media reports suggested that residents of AG, in particular those of Block E, experienced different kinds of stigma and discrimination (Moy, 2004) . We therefore attempted to document the nature of stigma experienced by the residents. Second, stigma may extend from an individual to those bearing different kinds of relationships to him/her (Goffman, 1968) . Such ''courtesy'' stigma may be based on genetic, contagion, moral, ethnic, and/or geographical reasons. Because of where they lived in the housing complex, subgroups of residents differed in their perceived risk for SARS. This allowed us to examine the phenomenon of associative stigma.",

Thus, the power of the media may become influential in the case of an epidemic and its consequent stigma. Finally, even in the presence of a major power differential between stigmatizers and the stigmatized, the latter are not necessarily passive recipients of stigma (Robin & Satterfield, 2002) . Instead, they may resist or cope with stigma by utilizing tangible or symbolic resources available to them.

With more resources, AG residents of a younger age and higher education/occupational levels were more likely to move out of AG. They also tended to use active disclosure to distance themselves from Block E residents. In contrast, older AG residents were more likely to use physical distancing to de-stigmatize themselves. Female AG residents demonstrated more anxiety than male AG residents. This is understandable because SARS had a direct impact on household routines such as maintenance of cleanliness over which women assume most responsibility. Finally, an exodus of all AG residents has not occurred. Because of limited economic resources, those who are unemployed or retired are more likely to stay in AG and report more psychosomatic symptoms due to falling property value instead. Proximity shapes stigma experience. Block E residents report more stigma and psychosomatic symptoms than other AG residents. Non-Phase I residents react differently to stigma attached to Block E. Phase IV residents, the farthest from Phase I, tend to avoid walking near Block E and its residents. This is structurally facilitated by the fact that they do not need to pass by Block E when going in and out of AG. Residents of Phase III, located near Block E, tend to avoid stigma by declaring their non-Block E status.",

Besides physical distancing, this is achieved via symbolic interaction in which individuals re-create social boundaries by defining the sense of ''us'' and demarcating those who are ''them'' (Kowalewski, 1988) . This ingroup-outgroup perception may be motivated by psychological and economic self-interest (Haghighat, 2001) . It is shown by the attempt of AG residents to actively declare their non-Block E status in both interpersonal and work domains. Stigmatized individuals also use ''downward social comparison'' to distinguish themselves from those who are in a worse situation than themselves (Gibbons, 1986) . Thus, non-Block E residents may disown part of the severe stigma toward AG by declaring that not the whole of AG is as dangerous as Block E. This destigmatization strategy can bring them psychological dividends and become powerfully self-reinforcing (Miller & Major, 2000; Haghighat, 2001) .",

He emphasizes that the media focus throughout the crisis is biased by myths that propel public panic. Repeatedly making valid risk comparisons (e.g., motorcycle accidents and suicide claimed 4000 and 2200 lives a year but SARS only 71 in Taiwan) and managing misperceptions about risk, Wen proposes, will produce more efficient (and, in the authors' view, less stigmatizing) public health responses (Wen, 2003) . Accurate risk communication has not, however, been a focus of SARS management in Hong Kong. Unsurprisingly, 64.6% of AG residents report dissatisfaction with the government's mode of handling health information and over 50% believe that biased media coverage has led to disproportionate stigmatization of AG.",

Second, as it is ethically and administratively problematic to carry out a prospective study during the SARS outbreak, we have used a retrospective approach. As such, the findings may not accurately capture the most vivid experience of stigma among AG residents. Third, although the interview data complement the survey data, the fact that only 2 Block E residents were interviewed limits the generalizability of our qualitative findings. Finally, stigma is a contested subject that can be studied from the often different perspectives of the stigmatized and stigmatizers (Heatherton, Kleck, & Hull, 2000) . This holds true especially for a novel illness that truly threatens public health. Future studies should go beyond subjective stigma to examine the perspectives of government officials, health care workers, employers, school administrators and other stakeholders.
