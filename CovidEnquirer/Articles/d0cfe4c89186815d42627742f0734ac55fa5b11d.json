Nonpathogenic organisms rapidly populate the sterile intestinal environment after birth, competing with potential pathogens for epithelial attachment sites and nutrients. 1 This blocks successful colonization of many pathogens. 1 Immunoglobulins in colostrum and milk help in preventing pathogenic effects of infectious agents. Organisms also stimulate local immune responses by mucosal plasma cells. Once stimulated, plasma cells produce IgA and IgM, providing additional immunologic protection as early as 5 to 10 days after parturition. 1 Intestinal motility results in confinement of most organisms to the lower ileum and colon. It is important to note this mechanism, as this explains the necessity of sampling from these sites for diagnostic specimens.",

Enteric pathogens have a limited number of mechanisms that cause diarrhea. Most common and important in the neonatal pig are: (1) toxic effects on epithelial cells causing fluid loss into the gut lumen, (2) direct destruction and loss of intestinal epithelial cells, and (3) local necrotizing effects on epithelium, lamina propria, or underlying tissues, with invasion of organisms into the lamina propria and underlying tissues. 1 Alterations of intestinal epithelial cells by locally active enterotoxins results in an imbalance of intracellular electrolytes and fluids (secretory diarrhea). Lesions observed include dilated fluid-filled intestines and Loss of intestinal epithelium with subsequent contraction of the lamina propria is recognized at necropsy by a thin-walled intestine and blunting of intestinal villi. Loss of absorptive surface and apical cells results in decreased absorption of ingesta (malabsorptive diarrhea). Undigested content is converted from lactose to lactate in the lumen by bacterial flora, resulting in an acid pH of content of the distal ileum and colon. Lactate, being an osmotically active molecule, draws fluid into the intestinal lumen, resulting in further potentiation of diarrhea. Loss of absorptive apical enterocytes results in poor absorption of other substances such as fat. Consequently, mesenteric lacteals are devoid of chyle or contain less than normal quantities.",

Clinical presentation of colibacillosis and transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) is similar in many respects. Some disease patterns can help in the clinical differentiation of these two diseases. Colibacillosis has a shorter age of onset hours) than TGE (approximately 72 hours). Colibacillosis spreads slowly and typically does not affect all litters. Clinically, TGE spreads rapidly, affecting most litters in a short time. In colibacillosis litters from gilts are more frequently affected than litters from sows. Mortality in colibacillosis varies from 5% to 70%, whereas TGE mortality approaches 100% in pigs less than 7 days old. 3 ,21 Sows or older pigs are not affected in colibacillosis but they are in acute outbreaks of TGE. By moistening a strip of pH test paper with feces at the anus, a presumptive diagnosis can be made on the basis of pH of diarrheic feces. A pH of 8.0 or higher is highly suggestive of colibacillosis.

Vaccines containing pili from ETEC strains are available to immunize pregnant gilts and SOWS. 18 Preferably, gilts and sows should be vaccinated at midgestation and again approximately 3 weeks before farrowing. Some situations may indicate the use of Kohler milk vaccine, in which a live unit-specific strain of ETEC grown in milk is top-dressed on gestating sow's feed. 7 This stimulates a good secretory antibody (IgA) response in the sow. Consequently, antibodies should be present in both colostrum and milk. 7 There is an inherent danger in using Kohler milk vaccine as neonates are exposed to live virulent ETEC. Sows must be dosed at least 3 weeks before farrowing to allow time for fecal shedding to diminish? Sows should be dosed in a separate facility from farrowing areas and washed before being moved into farrowing crates. 7 As with all vaccines, efficacy is dependent on adequate milk production by the gilt or sow, as well as the ability of pigs to nurse and ingest sufficient quantities of immunoglobulin. 7",

The disease was first described in 1946. 21 Since then, TGE has been reported in most of the major swine-producing countries. TGE is highly contagious. 21 Producers are apprehensive about TGE because (1) mortality in the neonate is high, (2) there is no effective practical treatment, (3) entrance of the virus into a herd is difficult to prevent because of the role of birds, especially starlings, and (4) commercial vaccines available are of limited effectiveness. 4 , 16, 17, 21 Clinical Signs: Acute or Epizootic TGE Acute TGE is generally first observed in growing and finishing pigs on the farm. Pigs in these age groups exhibit generally mild clinical signs of vomiting and diarrhea. Following infection of older pigs, TGE often appears explosively in the farrowing house, with most neonatal pigs becoming ill within a 24-to 48-hour period. Initial signs in neonates are roughening of haircoat, shivering, dehydration, vomiting, diarrhea, refusal to nurse, and extreme thirst. Neonatal pigs often attempt to drink water from any source and squeal weakly when handled. This is followed closely by a severe, watery diarrhea that has an acrid odor characteristic of sour milk. Pigs become dehydrated, weak, and die within 2 to 5 days. The mortality rate of pigs under 7 days of age during acute TGE breaks approaches 100%. Mortality is lower in older nursing pigs but can be influenced by stress such as chilling, dampness, and secondary bacterial infection. Lactating sows are susceptible during acute TGE.
