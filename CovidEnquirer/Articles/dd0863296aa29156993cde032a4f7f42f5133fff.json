As expected, BMM but not BMDC expressed type I IFN. IFN production in infected BMM was nearly completely dependent on signaling through the alpha/beta interferon (IFN-\u2423/\u2424) receptor (IFNAR). Several IFN-dependent cytokines and chemokines showed the same expression pattern, with enhanced production in BMM compared to BMDC and dependence upon signaling through the IFNAR. Exogenous IFN enhanced IFN-dependent gene expression in BMM at early times after infection and in BMDC at all times after infection but did not stimulate expression of molecules that signal through myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Collectively, our results show that IFN is produced at early times postinfection (p.i.) in MHV-infected BMM, but not in BMDC, and primes expression of IFN and IFN-responsive genes. Further, our results also show that BMM are generally more responsive to MHV infection, since MyD88-dependent pathways are also activated to a greater extent in these cells than in BMDC.",

SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) accessory proteins ORF3b and ORF6, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) accessory protein ORF5a, MHV and SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) proteins and replicase-associated nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) and nsp3 are all able to inhibit IFN induction and/or signaling (9-15) (reviewed in reference 16) . In addition, MHV delays IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) induction by IFN or Sendai virus (SenV) (17) . Further, in some cell types, including fibroblasts and cDC, neither SARS-CoV nor MHV induces IFN expression. However, neither virus is able to prevent IFN induction by other viruses or by poly(I \u00b7 C), which suggests that these viruses are \"invisible\" to intracellular IFN sensors (18, 19) . This \"passive\" method of immune evasion may occur because coronaviruses replicate on membranous structures, including double-membrane vesicles, thereby limiting exposure of sequestered RNA to innate immune sensors (18) (19) (20) . On first glance, these results appeared to contradict the observation that type I IFNs are detected in MHV-infected mice and in patients with SARS (21, 22) . However, IFN is induced in pDC by a TLR7-and interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)-dependent pathway, in macrophages and microglia in an MDA5-dependent pathway, and in oligodendrocyte cell lines via MDA5-and RIG-I-dependent pathways (23) (24) (25) . Collectively, these results show that coronaviruses use multiple approaches to evade the innate immune response and that the extent and nature of evasion are cell type dependent. The basis of these cell type-specific differences in IFN expression after coronavirus infection is not well understood.",

Using these cells, we showed that most of the IFN produced after MHV infection was dependent on signaling through the IFN-\u2423/\u2424 receptor (IFNAR). This IFN was critical for virus-induced upregulation of several IFN-related molecules, including MDA5, RIG-I, and CXCL10 (chemokine [C-X-C motif] ligand 10). Further, levels of type I IFN produced in MHVinfected BMM were sufficient to induce maximal activation, since exogenous type I IFN treatment did not further stimulate IFNrelated gene upregulation at late times postinfection (p.i.). Our results also showed that the expression of some inflammationassociated molecules, most notably tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-12, and IL-6, was mediated, in large part, via signaling through myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-dependent pathways.",

For the experiments described here, we used only MHV-A59 (MHV) because this virus grows to high titer and forms syncytia at later times postinfection (p.i.) than JHMV, allowing prolonged cell survival. Roth-Cross et al. showed that BMM produced type I IFN after MHV infection, but only late times p.i. (24 h p.i.) were examined in that initial study (24) . To determine the kinetics of IFN expression, we infected BMM or BMDC with MHV and then measured IFN-\u2424 mRNA and IFN protein levels at different times p.i. by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and by an IFN bioassay, respectively. Sendai virus (SenV) was included as a positive control, since it is known to induce IFN. SenV-infected BMM rapidly upregulated IFN expression with protein detected as early as 2 h p.i., and peak levels observed at approximately 8 h p.i. (Fig. 1A) . In contrast, MHV-infected BMM produced IFN much more slowly with levels of IFN-\u2424 mRNA or IFN protein barely detectable at 8 h p.i. Peak levels of IFN-\u2424 mRNA and protein were reached at 16 to 24 h p.i. (Fig. 1A to C). Maximal IFN protein levels were approximately 20-to 25-fold lower in MHVinfected cells than in SenV-infected cells ( Fig. 1A and B) . Although the IFN protein levels were much lower in MHV-infected BMM than in SenV-infected cells, IFN-\u2424 mRNA levels were higher in MHVinfected cells (Fig. 1A to C; see also Fig. 3C and E). This likely resulted from MHV-mediated inhibition of host cell translation, observed in MHV-infected fibroblasts (11, 14, 34, 35) . Consistent with previous findings (23, 32, 33) , we detected less than 3 U/ml of IFN in MHVinfected DC at 24 h p.i. (Fig. 1B) . These results did not reflect differences in the ability of the two cell types to produce IFN, because DC rapidly produced IFN after SenV infection and peak IFN protein lev- (52) . Two or three replicates were performed in each experiment, and one of three independent experiments is shown. els were only 2-fold less in SenV-infected BMDC than in BMM (Fig. 1A) . Of note, both BMM and BMDC were readily infected by MHV, although virus replication proceeded more rapidly in BMM, with syncytium formation detected as early as 6 h p.i. and peak viral titers observed at 8 to 12 h p.i. MHV reached maximal virus titers in BMDC that were approximately 1 log unit higher than in BMM (Fig. 1D) .",

Basal levels of MDA5 mRNA in mock-infected BMM were approximately 2-fold higher than in BMDC ( Fig. 2A ). After infection with MHV, MDA5 levels were upregulated with similar kinetics in BMM and BMDC; however, levels in BMM were about 20 to 30 times higher than in BMDC at 24 h p.i. (Fig. 2B and C) . Similar changes in expression of a second intracellular sensor molecule, RIG-I, were also observed. RIG-I is not believed to be critical for IFN production in MHV-infected BMM, although it has an important role in cells such as oligodendrocytes (25) .",

Thus, elevated baseline levels of MDA5 and RIG-I in MHVinfected BMM ( Fig. 2A ) might facilitate enhanced IFN production at early times p.i., which could then result in increased MDA5 and RIG-I expression after signaling through IFNAR. To examine this possibility, we cultured BMM from wild-type and IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea mice. We included BMM from MyD88 \u03ea/\u03ea mice in these experi-ments, since MyD88 is involved in signaling through TLRs but not IFNAR. We detected low basal levels of IFN, MDA5, and RIG-I in BMM from all mice, although the levels were lowest in IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea BMM (Fig. 3B ). The levels of IFN-\u2424, MDA5, and RIG-I mRNA were significantly lower in infected IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea BMM than in wildtype BMM (Fig. 3C) . However, the mRNA levels of these molecules in infected IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea BMM were still higher than in mockinfected IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea cells ( Fig. 3B and C), indicating that virus infection directly upregulates IFN-\u2424, MDA5, and RIG-I, but optimal induction requires signaling through the IFNAR. These differences did not result from differences in susceptibility to infection because equivalent titers of virus were observed in IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea , MyD88 \u03ea/\u03ea , and wild-type (WT) BMM at 16 h p.i. (Fig. 3A) . Of note, MHV titers are much higher in tissues of IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea mice than in wild-type mice. The lack of difference in titers in Fig. 3A may reflect the high multiplicity of infection that we used in our experiments or the well-described relative insensitivity of MHV to IFN signaling in tissue culture cells (13, 14, 37) .",

MHV infection induces expression of an array of cytokines and chemokines in the infected murine central nervous system (CNS), including CXCL10, CCL2 (chemokine [C-C motif] ligand 2), TNF, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-12, which play important roles in the anti-MHV immune response (39, 40) . We next examined whether BMM produced these cytokines and chemokines after MHV infection and, if so, whether their expression depended upon type I IFN production. We found that these genes were upregulated with similar kinetics in BMM and BMDC; however, BMM expressed much higher levels than BMDC did (Fig. 4A ) (data for IL-6 and IL-10 are not shown). These results were confirmed for TNF, CXCL10, and IL-12 p70 at the protein level by performing an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Fig. 4C and D) . No IL-12 p70 mRNA or protein was detected in BMDC. Of note, basal mRNA levels of CXCL10 and TNF were higher in BMM than in BMDC, while the reverse was true for CCL2 (Fig. 4B) . Nevertheless, all three were expressed at higher levels in BMM during the peak time of infection (Fig. 4A) , indicating that the differences in basal levels did not explain the ability of BMM to produce larger amounts of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in response to MHV infection.",

We also included an additional IFNresponsive gene ISG15 (IFN-stimulated gene 15) in these assays. Consistent with a previous study of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated BMM and BMDC (41), we found that CXCL10, IL-10, and ISG15 expression was dependent on IFNAR, but not MyD88, signaling (Fig. 5) . TNF, IL-6, and IL-12 p40 mRNA upregulation was abolished in MHV-infected MyD88 \u03ea/\u03ea cells and was variably dependent upon IFNAR signaling: the levels of IL-6 and IL-12 p40 were decreased by about 50 to 80% in IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea BMM ( Fig. 5A and B) . These mRNA data were confirmed by measuring the levels of CXCL10, TNF, and IL-12 p70 protein in an ELISA (Fig. 5C ). As in MHV-infected cells, CXCL10 expression in SenV-infected or poly(I \u00b7 C)-transfected BMM was also dependent on IFNAR, but not MyD88. However, TNF expression in these samples was not dependent on MyD88, consistent with a previous report showing that TNF expression was mediated by direct MDA5 recognition in SenV-infected cells (Fig. 5A) (42) . IL-6 and IL-12 p40 were expressed at very low levels in poly(I \u00b7 C)-treated or SenV-infected BMM, so expression of these cytokines was not analyzed further.",

Our results suggested that BMM expression of several inflammation-related molecules, including IFN-\u2423/\u2424, MDA5, RIG-I, and CXCL10, required signaling through the IFNAR. However, from these results, it could not be determined whether upregulated expression of these molecules occurred solely as a consequence of MHV-induced IFN induction or if some aspect of virus replication synergistically enhanced expression. Further, the amount of IFN produced in MHV-infected BMM was much lower than in SenV-infected cells, raising questions as to whether this amount was sufficient to fully upregulate these IFN-induced genes. To address these questions, we treated mock-infected or MHV-infected BMM with IFN-\u2424 and then measured mRNA levels of inflammatory molecules by real-time qPCR. The cells were treated with IFN-\u2424 at 4 h p.i. to minimize any effect that IFN treatment might have on virus replication; we could not detect any MHV-induced IFN-\u2424 RNA or IFN protein at this time p.i. (Fig. 1C) . We used a high dose of IFN (800 U of murine IFN-\u2424) so that any IFN-mediated effects would be readily apparent. For comparison, we also treated mock-and MHVinfected BMDC and 17Cl-1 cells with IFN, since IFN was barely detected at any time p.i. in these cells. IFN treatment did not reduce virus titers in any of these cells, when measured at 16 h p.i. (Fig. 6A) , consistent with previous reports (13, 32, 33) .",

No IFN protein was detected in either MHV-infected BMDC or 17Cl-1 cells (32, 43) , but low levels of IFN mRNA were detected at late times p.i. in these cells (23) . Treatment of MHV-infected BMDC with IFN induced significantly (P \u03fd 0.01) higher levels of IFN-\u2423/\u2424 mRNA than did IFN-\u2424 treatment or MHV infection alone, when measured at 16 h p.i., although the levels were only about 2% of those observed in infected BMM.

Exogenous IFN-\u2424 treatment enhanced expression of these molecules compared to MHV infection alone at 8 but not 16 h p.i., again suggesting that the amount of IFN produced by infected BMM was sufficient for maximal expression at later times p.i.

We detected much higher mRNA levels of MDA5 and RIG-I in MHVinfected BMM at 16 h p.i. than in IFN-\u2424-treated mock-infected cells, although the IFN level induced by MHV was actually lower than 800 U (Fig. 1A and B) . This likely occurred because MDA5 and RIG-I recognize viral PAMPs and directly upregulate expression of these IFN-dependent molecules via a positive-feedback loop. Additionally, these results also suggest that the effects of IFN on neighboring uninfected cells do not account for the elevated levels of IFN, MDA5, and RIG-I detected in these cultures after MHV infection, since the levels were substantially greater than those observed after IFN treatment of mock-infected cells.",

BMM and BMDC are derived from the same BM progenitor cells in the presence of different cytokines, but they show substantial differences in type I IFN production and in cytokine and chemokine profiles (41, 44) . Here, we show that maximal IFN production in murine coronavirusinfected BMM requires signaling through the IFNAR (Fig. 3C) . We could detect small amounts of IFN mRNA but not protein in MHVinfected BMM at 8 h p.i. (Fig. 1) . However, IFN may have been produced at low levels at this early time p.i. but immediately depleted by binding to the IFNAR. In support of this, in a prior study, basal expression of IFN by BMM was detected when IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea but not WT BMM were examined by an ELISA (41) . Together, these results suggest that a very small amount of IFN produced initially following infection effected a large increase in the levels of IFN and other inflammatory molecules via autocrine signaling. However, treatment of uninfected BMM with exogenous IFN did not induce the same level of expression of some of these molecules as occurred in MHVinfected cells at 16 h p.i. (Fig. 6) . Thus, active virus replication induced cytokine and chemokine expression via additional pathways in BMM. Furthermore, these molecules were largely produced by infected cells and not neighboring uninfected cells.",

The levels of MDA5 and RIG-I increased greatly after infection via an IFN-dependent pathway, providing additional pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) for detecting virus replication products. By late times To determine whether upregulation required active virus replication, BMM were exposed to UV-inactivated virus prior to IFN treatment, and the levels of select genes were determined (shown in the boxes to the right of the graph for BMM 16-h sample graphs). C T ratios to HPRT are shown. All genes were induced to higher levels in BMM than in BMDC or 17Cl-1 cells (note the differences in scale). Three or four replicates were performed in each experiment, and one of three independent experiments is shown. Values that were statistically significantly different from the values for cells infected with MHV and treated with IFN are indicated as follows: *, P \u03fd 0.05; **, P \u03fd 0.01. p.i., sufficient levels of IFN were synthesized so that exogenously added IFN had no effect on the levels of any molecules that were examined. Similar effects were observed in BMDC and 17Cl-1 fibroblasts, but in these cells, no or very small amounts of IFN mRNA (Fig. 6B ) and no protein (18, 23, 32, 33) were produced endogenously. Consequently, in both cell types, exogenous IFN treatment significantly upregulated expression of MDA5, RIG-I, CXCL10, and ISG15. These results are consistent with recent reports showing that IFN priming prior to tissue culture cell infection with SARS-CoV resulted in augmented expression of several molecules involved in IFN induction and signaling pathways, including CXCL10, RIG-I, MDA5, IRF-7, IFN-\u2424, ISG15, and 2=,5=oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) (45) . Analogous results were obtained when human conventional DC were primed with IFN prior to infection with influenza A virus (IAV) (46) . Collectively, our results suggest that IFN is critical for maximal expression of these proinflammatory mediators, but unlike MHV-infected BMDC or 17Cl-1 cells, sufficient amounts of IFN are expressed endogenously via an MDA5-dependent pathway in infected BMM to initiate the process.",

            "text": "The enhanced responsiveness of BMM compared to BMDC or fibroblasts to MHV infection also occurs after exposure to other stimuli. The levels of IFN-dependent proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL10, were higher in BMM than in BMDC after stimulation with LPS (44) . This increased sensitivity to MHV infection is not likely to be a function of differences in basal levels because baseline levels of MDA5 and RIG-I are only 2-fold higher in BMM than in BMDC ( Fig. 2A) ; both cell types should have responded nearly equivalently to infection, if basal levels of MDA5 were the only factor. On the other hand, MDA5 levels are extremely low in 17Cl-1 cells (Fig. 6C ) (24) , and this may have contributed to the inability of these cells to produce IFN and other IFN-dependent proteins. Another possible explanation for the difference in IFN expression in infected BMM compared to BMDC or fibroblasts is that virus replication could occur on different types of membranous structures in the different cell types. MHV is known to replicate on double-membrane vesicles (DMV) and other intracellular membranes (20) . DMV may shield viral dsRNA from detection by MDA5 and RIG-I, so differences in the numbers of DMV or in the types of membranous structures used in replication could potentially contribute to differences in PAMP recognition and subsequent IFN induction. However, we detected no obvious differences in the types of virus-specific membranous structures observed in BMM compared to other cells when analyzed by electron microscopy (data not shown); if anything, the numbers of DMV in infected BMM were increased more than in other cells, probably reflecting the more rapid course of infection observed in these cells (Fig. 1D) . Thus, an outstanding question is how the milieu of resting macrophages differs from those of BMDC and fibroblasts, enabling rapid and extensive upregulation of IFN-\u2423/\u2424 and other proinflammatory molecules after infection with coronaviruses.",

Thus, expression of TNF, IL-12, and IL-6 ( Fig. 5) is completely dependent upon signaling through MyD88. MyD88 is a key adaptor molecule in signaling pathways used by IL-1, IL-18, and all of the TLRs except TLR3. We examined the expression of TLR2, -3, -4, -6, and -7 and found that they were expressed at low levels in uninfected BMM and upregulated after MHV infection (data not shown). Therefore, signaling through one of these molecules could initiate the expression of these MyD88-dependent cytokines. In fact, IL-6 and TNF production in peritoneal macrophages infected with the hepatotropic MHV-3 strain is TLR2 dependent (47) . However, in preliminary experiments, we detected the same levels of TNF and IL-6 in MHV-A59-infected B6 and TLR2 \u03ea/\u03ea BMM, suggesting that TLR2 does not have the same critical role in BMM as observed in MHV-3infected peritoneal macrophages. Consistent with this putative cellspecific difference in expression, splenic macrophages but not BMM produce TNF in response to TLR2 ligands (48) .",

Cycle threshold (C T ) values were normalized to the values for the housekeeping gene hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) by the following equation: C T \u03ed C T (gene of interest) \u03ea C T (HPRT) . All results are shown as a ratio to HPRT calculated as \u03ea2 C T . IFN bioassay. The levels of IFN were measured using a bioassay based on the inhibition of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) growth in L929 cells. Supernatants were harvested from infected BMM or BMDC, and infectious virus was inactivated by exposure to UV light. L929 cells infected with 10,000 PFU VSV were treated with dilutions of supernatants or defined amounts of recombinant murine IFN-\u2424 at 30 min p.i. The titers of VSV were determined on Vero cells. IFN levels were calculated on the basis of standard curves generated with recombinant IFN-\u2424.",
