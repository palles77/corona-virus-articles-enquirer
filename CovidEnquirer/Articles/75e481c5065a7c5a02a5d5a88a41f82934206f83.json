The numerous iterations required to linearize these equations in CFD involve substantial computer time and memory but CFD has gained popularity as computer technologies have advanced. Results can be presented as three-dimensional colour illustrations covering many types of engineering fluidflow problems and heat transfers. 21 CFD has been used to investigate the ventilation performance of operating room contamination control strategies; to examine surgical suite ventilation systems and to identify further ventilation improvements for operating room environments and air contamination control. 22e25 CFD has also been used to analyse the risk of cross-infection with different general ward ventilation designs and to study the effects of ward ventilation supply and exhaust positioning. 26e28 An abundance of ventilation and airborne contamination research has examined isolation rooms in hospitals with validated results. 29, 30 CFD is particularly suitable for these investigations because the collection and analysis of actual airborne samples from wards can be risky and difficult. 31 For high-risk studies CFD provides a safe and accurate estimate of the movement of air and contaminants. 32 A recent study conducted by the authors provides a more detailed description of CFD. 33 This study used CFD to verify a simple and cost-effective ventilation set-up in a general ward, which was shown to match the CDC's standards for isolation facilities. This was a long-term solution, whereas in the current study CFD was used to verify the fast-track, makeshift isolation set-up employed during SARS.",

There is no absolute value or target for LMAA and CRE because no research has been carried out in this respect. LMAA and CRE values for the makeshift set-up can only be compared with those for the isolation ward. Table I shows that the CRE value in the isolation room was 0.9568. The LMAA values in the vicinity of both patients and HCWs were in the region of 100, which is nine times better than those in the normal general wards and similar to those found in a similar study. 14 Makeshift set-up with simple exhaust fan installation As shown in Table I , the CRE of the makeshift set-up (2.1890) was better than that of the standard isolation room (0.9568). The relatively low LMAA value in the makeshift set-up (88.4 s for patients, 55.48 s for HCWs) was also better than that in the isolation ward (99.893 s for patients, 100.41 s for HCWs).",

In the makeshift set-up, the high CRE value means that more contaminants are extracted to the exhaust point than to the vicinity of the patients and HCWs. The low LMAA means a shorter duration of the indoor air stream coming into contact with the patients and HCWs, thereby reducing the chance of airborne infection within the ward. Most importantly, air flows from the clean corridor to the less-clean ward cubicle and subsequently to the outside atmosphere, thus preventing infection from spreading through the corridor and beyond to other parts of the hospital.",
