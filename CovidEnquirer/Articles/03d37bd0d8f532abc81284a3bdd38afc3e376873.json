Here, we adapted an anion exchange resin-based method, initially developed to concentrate negatively charged viruses from water, to liquid impingement-based bioaerosol sampling. In this method, aerosolized viruses are collected in a 20 ml liquid sample contained within widely used impingers, BioSamplers (SKC Inc., Eighty Four, PA), and further concentrated via adsorption to an anion exchange resin that is suspended within this liquid. Viral nucleic acids are then extracted from the resin to facilitate molecular analyses through a reduction in the effective sample volume. For this study, various quantities of two negatively charged viruses, type A and type B influenza viruses (FluMist Quadrivalent vaccine) and the male-specific (F+) RNA coliphage MS2 (MS2), were nebulized into a custom-built bioaerosolization chamber, and sampled using BioSamplers with and without anion exchange resin. Compared to direct testing of the BioSampler liquid, detection was improved by 6.77\u00d7 and 3.33\u00d7 for type A and type B influenza viruses, respectively, by using the anion exchange resin. For MS2, the anion exchange resin method allowed for an average improvement in detection of 8.26\u00d7.",

The important role of bioaerosols in viral transmission is highlighted by recent events, such as the 2014-2015 outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in U.S. poultry production. In this outbreak, multiple independent lines of epidemiological evidence suggested perpetuation within and between poultry production facilities by influenza virusladen bioaerosols (United States Department of Agriculture, 2015). Ultimately, 48 million birds were euthanized with economic losses estimated at $3.3 billion (Greene, 2015) . Accordingly, active sampling of bioaerosols has been suggested as a tool to help mitigate viral transmission (Anderson et al., 2016; Cowling et al., 2013) . Therefore, highly efficacious bioaerosol sampling strategies are needed.",

            "text": "The collection of airborne viruses is generally accomplished using a variety of inertia-based samplers. These samplers include cyclones, impactors, filter-based devices, and impingers (Haig et al., 2016; Verreault et al., 2008) . Cyclones and impactors are typically used to size-segregate aerosols based on particle diameter while filter-based devices will collect an integrated sample across a defined range of particle sizes. The most widely used sampling strategy for viruses is liquid impingement. This technique purportedly reduces samplingrelated stresses (e.g. impaction force, desiccation) compared to the other methods described above (Verreault et al., 2008) . With liquid impingement, bioaerosols are drawn through nozzles to produce an impinging jet that deposits particles into a liquid-filled chamber. This liquid can then be processed using culture or molecular-based methods for viral identification and characterization. However, approximately 20 ml of liquid is required for the effective operation of many liquid impingers (Pepper et al., 2015) , resulting in an undesirable dilutive effect that ultimately limits the sensitivity of downstream detection (Gendron et al., 2010; Hermann et al., 2006) . Thus, strategies which enable additional concentration of viruses within liquid impingers would improve the overall performance of these systems.",

Similar to batch chromatography, anion exchange resin was suspended and mixed with aqueous samples to adsorb negatively charged viruses. The liquid was then decantated so that nucleic acids could be directly isolated from the resin in a small volume (60-80 \u03bcl), and viruses were detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Compared to direct testing of the water sample by qPCR, the anion exchange resin method allowed for improved detection of all viruses tested. Specifically, detection was improved 50\u00d7 to 200\u00d7 for FRNA coliphages, 4300\u00d7 for human adenovirus 40, 128\u00d7 for rotavirus, and 20\u00d7 for hepatitis A virus (Perez-Mendez et al., 2014a) . Additionally, we observed that the anion exchange resin method was functional in water samples with diverse physicochemical properties. Therefore, we hypothesized that the anion exchange resin method may be applied to air sampling methods, such as liquid impingement, to improve the detection of negatively-charged viruses.",

Thus, the anion exchange resin would serve as a second virus concentration step within the overall sampling system. MS2 was selected for evaluation given the precedence for effective anion exchange resin-based concentration in water (Perez-Mendez et al., 2014b) . Further, MS2 is considered to be a surrogate of negatively charged enteric viruses (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2000; Michen and Graule, 2010; Vergara et al., 2015) and is used as a model organism for the evaluation of liquid impingers (Tung-Thompson et al., 2015; Turgeon et al., 2014) . Similarly, influenza viruses are reported to have negative charges (Michen and Graule, 2010) and have been used in the evaluation of liquid impinger-based bioaerosol sampling (Turgeon et al., 2014) .",

The disparity in sensitivities between these two systems is partially explained by the fact that MS2 adsorption in PBS, which is recommended for impingement by the BioSampler manufacturer, is less efficient than in dechlorinated tap water (decreased sensitivity of approximately 2 Cq).

Using a modified double agar overlay plaque assay described previously (Kropinski et al., 2009) , the integrity of MS2 was assessed in the inocula used for nebulization and BioSampler liquid samples. Bacteriophage titers in both pre-and postnebulized inocula were generally unchanged and were in agreement with qRT-PCR results. In contrast, only sporadic detection of MS2 was achieved in BioSampler liquid samples when the inocula concentrations were 10 6 pfu/ml or 10 5 pfu/ml, despite that qRT-PCR measurements indicated that approximately 10 4 and 10 3 pfu/ml of MS2, respectively, were present within these samples. Nevertheless, results obtained by Turgeon et al. (2014) indicated that the relative recovery of aerosolized MS2 collected within BioSamplers was on the same order of magnitude by both qRT-PCR and plaque assay when an impingement buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgSO 4 was utilized. Thus, the formulation of an optimized impingement buffering system will be critical to achieve maximum sensitivity of the anion-exchange resin-based bioaerosol sampling method. The anion exchange resin method also allowed for the improved qRT-PCR detection of type A and type B influenza viruses within BioSamplers compared to direct testing of the corresponding 140 \u03bcl liquid BioSampler aliquots. On average, the resin improved detection by 6.77\u00d7 and 3.33\u00d7 for type A and type B influenza viruses, respectively. In contrast to MS2, both type A and type B influenza viruses were detected more effectively at higher inoculum concentrations. Detection was improved by 9.55\u00d7 and 6.98\u00d7 for type A and type B influenza viruses, respectively, when the viral inoculum used for nebulization was at a concentration of 10 3.5 FFU/ml. Each 10-fold dilution of the inocula decreased the detection sensitivity by an average of 2\u00d7 for both type A and type B influenza viruses. Viral adsorption to surfaces has been suggested to function in a concentration-dependent manner, where the frequencies of impacts of viruses to adsorbent surfaces are more probable at higher viral concentrations (Gerba, 1984) . However, in experiments to adsorb influenza viruses spiked directly into 50 ml of dechlorinated tap water, increased viral concentrations were correlated with diminished detection improvement across all concentrations tested (10 1.5 -10 3.5 FFU/ml) (Table S2) . Therefore, concentration-dependent changes in influenza detection sensitivity in the bioaerosol system are potentially an artifact of nebulization and/or the sampling system.",

While this metric indicated little change in viral RNA concentration over the course of experiments, it does not offer a direct evaluation of the nebulization process on viral stability. Nebulization is reported to have an impact on virus integrity. For example, decreases in viral titer between 100\u00d7 and 1000\u00d7 were reported for bacteriophage \u02786 (a surrogate used for influenza viruses) following nebulization, whereas the impact of nebulization on MS2 is reportedly less substantial (Turgeon et al., 2014 ). Our experimental system was not directly capable of monitoring viral survival or stability following nebulization. Factors such as desiccation, impaction on the axial fans, adsorption to the bioaerosol chamber surface, or shearing during sampling may have had a deleterious impact on viral sampling or detection. An additional limitation to this study is that environmental conditions within the bioaerosol chamber was subject to some fluctuations. Despite these environmental fluctuations, only minor variations in the Cq between experimental replicates were observed (see Tables 1 and S1 ).",

The method is simple to perform, can be adapted to existing aerosol sampling methods, is cost-effective, and allows for molecular detection of viral nucleic acids directly extracted from the anion exchange resin. Future work will focus on optimizing sampling parameters to minimize potentially adverse factors affecting lower than expected concentration/recovery efficiencies.",
