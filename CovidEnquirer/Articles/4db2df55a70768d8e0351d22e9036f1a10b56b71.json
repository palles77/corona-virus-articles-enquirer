While respiratory disease is common in both S. choleraesuis and PRRSV infections, the factors that contribute to its development remain largely unde\u00aened. We investigated the interaction of PRRSV, S. choleraesuis, and stress in 5-weekold swine. All combinations of three factors (inoculation with S. choleraesuis on Day 0, PRRSV on Day 3, and treatment with dexamethasone on Days 3\u00b17) were used to produce eight treatment groups in two independent trials. Fecal samples, tonsil and nasal swabs, serum samples and postmortem tissues were collected for bacteriologic and virologic examinations. No clinical signs were observed in pigs inoculated with only PRRSV or only S. choleraesuis. In contrast, pigs which were dually infected with S. choleraesuis and PRRSV exhibited unthriftiness, rough hair coats, dyspnea, and diarrhea. The pigs which received all three treatment factors were the most severely affected and 43% (three of seven) of the animals in this group died. Individuals in this group shed signi\u00aecantly higher quantities of S. choleraesuis in feces and had signi\u00aecantly higher serum PRRSV Veterinary Microbiology 71 (2000) 177\u00b1192 : S 0 3 7 8 -1 1 3 5 ( 9 9 ) 0 0 1 7 5 -3 titers compared to other treatments (p 0.05). In addition, S. choleraesuis and PRRSV were shed longer and by more pigs in this group than other groups and S. choleraesuis was recovered from more tissues in this group on Day 21 post inoculation. These results suggested that PRRSV, S. choleraesuis, and dexamethasone acted synergistically to produce a syndrome similar to that observed in the \u00aeeld. #",

            "text": "Subclinically infected pigs are considered the most common source of new S. choleraesuis infections. A carrier state was demonstrated in which pigs experimentally inoculated with S. choleraesuis remained persistently infected for at least 12 weeks . While respiratory disease is a common sequela of acute S. choleraesuis infection, the factors that contribute to its development remain largely unde\u00aened. A variety of stressors, including the presence of viral disease, have been suggested to potentiate or exacerbate clinical outbreaks of salmonellosis (Schwartz, 1991) . Exacerbation of infectious diseases, including S. choleraesuis, has been attributed to concurrent infection with PRRSV. Salmonella choleraesuis was one of several common secondary infections reportedly associated with herds chronically infected with PRRSV (Joo and Dee, 1993) . Increases in the incidence and severity of salmonellosis and other diseases in association with PRRSV infections have been recognized in Britain (Done and Paton, 1995) . Investigators demonstrated a positive association between the seroprevalence of PRRSV and infection with porcine respiratory corona virus or porcine in\u00afuenza virus (Groschup et al., 1993) . Stevenson et al. (1993) suggested that concurrent PRRSV infections were responsible for increased nursery mortality due to S. choleraesuis septicemia. However, few controlled studies have shown an interaction between PRRSV and a secondary infection. Galina et al. (1994) inoculated 13-day-old pigs with Streptococcus suis seven days after inoculation with PRRSV. The dually infected pigs developed suppurative meningitis, mononuclear perivascular cuf\u00aeng in the brain, while non-inoculated and S. suis-only inoculated pigs did not. Shimizu et al. (1994) reported increased severity of Mycoplasma hyorhinis pneumonia \u00aeve days after PRRSV. However, only two pigs were used in each group.",

The pigs that died had actually lost weight during the trial, and therefore, would probably have lowered the ADG of the SPD group if they had survived.

The level and duration of shedding of S. choleraesuis for the SPN and SND groups tended to be less than SPD and greater than SNN pigs. Extrapolated into \u00aeeld conditions, the prolonged and elevated shedding of S. choleraesuis seen in SPD pigs would be expected to provide higher and longer levels of exposure of S. choleraesuis to herdmates, thereby providing a mechanism for more severe disease. Other research has shown higher infectious doses of S. choleraesuis results in more severe clinical disease (Gray et al., 1996b) . These results in combination with evidence of more widely systemic infections at necropsy also suggest pigs concurrently infected with PRRSV and subjected to stress were less resistant to spread of S. choleraesuis and may be more susceptible to overwhelming infections with the bacteria. This mechanism would support clinical observations that a variety of stressors, including other viral infections, exacerbate clinical outbreaks of salmonellosis (Schwartz, 1991) . It would also support suggestions that PRRSV was associated with increasing the clinical effects of salmonellosis in the \u00aeeld (Stevenson et al., 1993) .",

A signi\u00aecant decrease in the proportion of PAMs has been observed in pigs following PRRSV infection. This may have major consequences on defense mechanisms and susceptibility to secondary infections. Under experimental conditions, the proportion of alveolar macrophages in lung lavage decreased from >95% of total cells collected to approximately 50% by Day 7 post challenge Zhou et al., 1992) . In addition, alterations in the function of pulmonary macrophages were also observed after PRRS virus infection. The production of in\u00afammatory cytokines by alveolar macrophages, such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor, was enhanced and nonspeci\u00aec bactericidal activity of the cells was suppressed (Zhou et al., 1992) . In addition to PAMs, pulmonary intravascular macrophages (PIMs) are susceptible to PRRSV infection (Thanawongnuwech et al., 1997) . PIMs play an important role in the clearance of bacteria and particulates from blood (Winkler, 1988) . Thanawongnuwech et al. (1997) found that intravascular macrophages are susceptible to PRRSV infection and infection was detrimental to their bactericidal activity. In a follow-up study, it was demonstrated that PRRSV infection impaired the ability of intravascular macrophages to clear blood-borne particles (Bautista et al., 1999) . Since PIMs play a critical role in the clearance of foreign bodies from the blood stream, decreased function may make pigs more susceptible to bacterial infection, septicemia, and clinical disease. This would provide a partial explanation for the observed synergism between PRRSV and S. choleraesuis.",

However, the treatment clearly potentiated both the PRRSV and the Salmonella infections, as it was designed to do. We observed the most profound effects of each individual pathogen when it was combined with the dexamethasone and the most severe clinical effects when all three factors were combined. The higher febrile response observed when Salmonella was combined with dexamethasone is somewhat contradictory when considered with the decreased monocyte activity expected by this anti-in\u00afammatory agent.
