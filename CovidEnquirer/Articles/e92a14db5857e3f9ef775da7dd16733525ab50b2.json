The isolation protocol consisted of affinity chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. XILP inhibited mycelial growth in various phytopathogenic fungi. The antifungal activity was thermostable and pH-stable. XILP inhibited proliferation of various cancer cell lines but did not do so in human embryonic liver (WRL 68) cells. There was no mitogenic activity toward mouse splenocytes. XILP reduced the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with an IC 50 of 11.1 lM, but lacked inhibitory activity toward HIV-1 integrase and SARS coronavirus proteinase. In conclusion, sorghum XILP is thermostable and pH stable and exhibits potent antifungal, antiproliferative, and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activities.",

Aspergillus flavus, Alternaria alternata and Fusarium oxysporum are the fungal pathogens affecting cereal (barley, sorghum and wheat) seedlings (Hasan, 2001) . The damage caused by grain mould in sorghum storage quality, food and feed processing quality, and market value. Some phytopathogenic fungi produce mycotoxins that deleteriously affect human health and reproduction. A few sorghum cultivars could evade grain mould since their grains mature only after the cessation of rains because moisture causes grain mould. Waniska et al., 2001 observed a wide variation in the amount of antifungal protein present in different sorghum cultivars. A variety of antifungal proteins such as chitinase, glucanse, thionin, defensin, protease inhibitor, and ribosome inactivating protein have been reported form sorghum. Antifungal proteins purified from cereals include rice lectin (Tabary, Font, & Bourrillon, 1987) , ribosome inactivating protein from wheat (Habuka et al., 1993) , and other antifungal proteins from buckwheat (Leung & Ng, 2007) , wheat (Ghosh, 2009 ) maize (Perri et al., 2009 ) and barley (Kirubakaran & Sakthivel, 2007) . Antifungal proteins are of special significance since they are deployed to fight off pathogenic fungi.",

A graph plotting% decrease in area of mycelial colony caused by XILP against the concentration of XILP was then plotted.

The assay takes advantage of the ability of reverse transcriptase to synthesize DNA, starting from the template/primer hybrid poly (A) oligo (dT) 15. The digoxigenin-and biotin-labelled nucleotides in an optimised ratio are incorporated into one of the same DNA molecule, which is freshly synthesized by the reverse transcriptase (RT). The detection and quantification of synthesized DNA as a parameter for RT activity follows a sandwich ELISA protocol. Biotin-labelled DNA binds to the surface of microtiter plate modules that have been precoated with streptavidin. In the next step, an antibody to digoxigenin, conjugated to peroxidase, binds to the digoxigenin-labelled DNA. In the final step, the peroxidase substrate is added. The peroxidase enzyme catalyses the cleavage of the substrate, producing a coloured reaction product. The absorbance of the sample at 405 nm can be determined using a microtiter plate (ELISA) reader and is directly correlated to the level of RT activity. A fixed amount (4-6 ng) of recombinant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase was used. The inhibitory activity of XILP was calculated as percent inhibition as compared to a XILP (Wong et al., 2011) . 2.10.

Cation exchange chromatography of fraction B2 on SP-Sepharose gave rise to three fractions, S1, S2 and S3 (Fig. 1B) . Antifungal activity was confined to fraction S2 eluted with 0.5 M NaCl in 10 mM NH 4 OAc buffer (pH 4.5). FPLC of fraction S2 on Mono S resulted in a small unadsorbed fraction M1 without antifungal activity. Elution of the adsorbed proteins with the three linear NaCl concentration gradients (0-0.2, 0.2-0.7 and 0.6-1 M) in 10 mM NH 4 OAc buffer (pH 4.5) produced four adsorbed fractions M2, M3, M4 and M5 (Fig. 1C) . Antifungal activity was detected only in fraction M4. Fraction M4 was subsequently resolved on Superdex 75 into a main fraction P2 with antifungal activity and two tiny fractions P1 and P3 without activity (Fig. 1D) . Fraction P2 displayed a single band with a molecular mass of 25 kDa in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2) . The yields of the various active chromatographic fractions from 2000 g seeds were as follows: 15 537 mg crude extract, 5362 mg fraction B2 from Affi-Gel Blue Gel column, 1465 mg fraction S2 from SP-Sepharose column, 211 mg fraction M4 from Mono S column, and 43 mg P2 (XILP) from Superdex 75 column.

            "text": "Sorghum XILP exerted an antiproliferative action over a variety of tumor cells comprising HepG2, MCF7, SiHa, and HT29 cells, but there was no similar effect on embryonic liver WRL68 cells (Fig. 5A ). Its potencies toward the different tumor cells followed the ranking MCF7 (IC 50 = 3.1 lM) > HepG2 (IC 50 = 4 lM) > SiHa (IC 50 > 33.8 lM) > HT29 (IC 50 > 77.6 lM) (Fig. 5A) . The activity is highly potent toward hepatoma (HepG2) cells and breast cancer (MCF7) cells but less potent toward cervical cancer cells and colon cancer cells. Its varying inhibitory potencies against different tumor cells are consistent with similar findings on other antitumor proteins e.g. ribosome inactivating proteins, and another class of antifungal proteins. Leguminous defensins/defensin-like antifungal peptides inhibit HL60, L1210, HepG2 and MCF7 tumor cells (Wong & Ng, 2003) . In contrast to some other antifungal proteins, sorghum XILP is devoid of mitogenic activity (Fig. 5D) . Sorghum XILP exerts a highly potent inhibitory activity against HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with an IC 50 of 11.1 lM (Fig. 5B ). Its potency (IC 50 = 11 lM) is higher than those of many anti-HIV-1 natural products (Ng, Huang, Fong, & Yeung, 1997) . The mechanism of inhibition may entail protein-protein inhibition, as in the case of inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase by the homologous protease (Bottcher & Grosse, 1997) . In contrast to some other antifungal proteins, sorghum XILP has no inhibitory activity toward HIV-1 integrase. Both French bean defensin-like peptide and sorghum XILP lack inhibitory activity toward HIV-1 integrase and SARS coronavirus proteinase (data not shown). Antifungal proteins (Lin & Ng, 2009; Lin et al., 2010; Wang & Ng, 2003; Wong & Ng, 2003) , ribosome inactivating proteins, lectins, protease inhibitors, and ribonucleases may have some or all of the following activities: antifungal, anti-HIV-enzyme and antiproliferative activities. These proteins are defence proteins or antipathogenic proteins that resist attack of noxious pathogens including fungi and viruses. They may also have antitumor activity. Sorghum XILP is thermostable and pH-stable and exhibits potent antifungal, antiproliferative, and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activities. Different fungal species and tumor cell lines are susceptible to this XILP. In view of the emergence of fungal strains with resistance to currently available drugs (Bolard, 1986 ) (Thevissen et al., 1996 , there is a need to develop new antifungal drugs. Sorghum XILP is one such candidate.",

            "text": "The Lineweaver-Burk double reciprocal plot revealed that sorghum XILP inhibited xylanase in a competitive manner because the same Vmax could be obtained by increasing the xylan concentration (Fig. 5C ). The N-terminal sequence of sorghum XILP exhibits some homology to xylanase inhibitors. Currently very few antifungal proteins have been reported to be xylanase inhibitors (Dash, Ahmad, Nath, & Rao, 2001; Tokunaga & Esaka, 2007) . Sorghum XILP isolated in this study belongs to a new class of antifungal proteins and defence proteins, the xylanase inhibitors. Previously a 26-kDa xylanase inhibitor with no sequence reported was identified as one of the antifungal proteins detected in maize suspension culture (Perri et al., 2009) . A xylanase inhibitor from Bacillus sp. inhibited fungal growth in Alternaria, Aspergillus, Curvularia, Colletotricum, Fusarium, and Phomopsis species and Trichoderma sp. (Dash et al., 2001) . However its sequence is unlike that of sorghum xylanase inhibitor. Sorghum xylanase inhibitor resembles xylanase inhibitors from wheat (Triticum aestivum) and rice (Oryza sativa) in N-terminal sequence but not in molecular mass. No report of antifungal activity of wheat and rice xylanase inhibitor is available. Hence, xylanase inhibitors constitute a new class of antifungal proteins although information regarding xylanase XILP toward Mycosphaerella arachidicola. The same amount (2 lg) of antifungal was added to each paper disc (except the control disc labelled as (C). The numbers in panel (A) (50-100) near the paper discs represent the various temperatures at which the XILP had been pretreated for 10 min before assay for antifungal activity. The numbers in panel (B), (1-4) on left plate and (10-14) on right plate represent the various pH values (prepared using NaOH and HCl solutions) to which the XILP had been exposed for 30 min before neutralisation and then assay for antifungal activity.",
