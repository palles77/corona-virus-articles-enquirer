F1S1 was composed of N-terminally truncated S1 subunit of pertussis toxin and type I immunodominant domain of filamentous hemagglutinin which are both known as protective immunogens against pertussis. The recombinant L. lactis was administered via oral or intranasal routes to BALB/c mice and the related specific systemic and mucosal immune responses were then evaluated. The results indicated significantly higher levels of specific IgA in the lung extracts and IgG in sera of mucosally-immunized mice, compared to their controls. It was revealed that higher levels of IgG2a, compared to IgG1, were produced in all mucosally-immunized mice. Moreover, immunized mice developed Th1 responses with high levels of IFN-\u03b3 production by the spleen cells. These findings provide evidence for L. lactis to be used as a suitable vehicle for expression and delivery of F1S1 fusion protein to mucosa and induction of appropriate systemic and mucosal immune responses against pertussis.",

            "text": "Bordetella pertussis is the primary causative agent of pertussis or whooping cough, a severe disease in infants, young children and even in adolescents and adults [1] . The disease is initiated by adherence of the bacterium to ciliated respiratory epithelium of the upper respiratory tract. Several virulence factors including pertussis toxin (PT), adenylate cyclase toxin, dermonecrotic toxin, filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) and fimbriae are involved in B. pertussis pathogenesis [2, 3] . Whole cell pertussis (wP) vaccine which has been used for routine childhood vaccination confers protection against the disease and has significantly reduced the number of cases, as well as associated morbidity and mortality since its introduction in the 1950s. However, due to their high reactogenicity, wP vaccines were replaced in some countries by acellular pertussis (aP) vaccines which contain a few defined and purified antigens with reduced amounts of lipopolysaccharide [4] . The detoxified pertussis toxin (PT) and filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) are the two main components of the commercially available aP vaccines. PT is one of the major virulence factors of B. pertussis and is composed of five subunits, termed as S1 to S5; among which S1 is the most immunogenic and protective part of the toxin [5] . The other major component of aP vaccines is FHA which mediates the bacterial attachment and colonization of the respiratory epithelia. This protein is a potent immunogen that induces systemic and mucosal antibody responses in humans and mice, following the infection [2, 6] . The high cost of purification of these major antigens is a drawback, particularly for their widespread use in the developing countries. Moreover, aP vaccines elicit a Th2 type immune response which is not the most effective immune response required for protection against the infection [7, 8] .",

            "text": "B. pertussis enters and colonizes the body through the respiratory mucosa which is the first line of the host defense against this pathogenic organism. Several studies have suggested the importance of local secretory antibodies (IgA) and Th1-type immune responses during anti-B. pertussis immune responses [7] [8] [9] . Mucosally-administered vaccines can induce both the systemic and the mucosal immune responses while parenteral vaccines mainly activate the systemic immune response. Due to the fact that mucosally-administered soluble antigens are in general poorly immunogenic, several approaches, such as their encapsulation or expression in attenuated bacterial hosts, have been used to improve their immunogenicity. However, the attenuated bacterial hosts may still be able to cause a limited infection in infants as well as the aged and immunocompromised people [10] . An attractive alternative to overcome this problem is the development of a new vaccine in association with lactic acid bacteria (LAB) which are safe mucosal delivery vehicles [11] . LAB are nonpathogenic and noninvasive Gram-positive organisms that produce lactic acid from carbohydrate fermentation. They have been widely consumed for centuries by humans in fermented foods; hence, are classified as GRAS (generally regarded as safe) organisms. Lactococcus lactis is the best-known LAB that has been extensively manipulated, and in particular has been used for heterologous protein expression and delivery vehicle via mucosal routes, reviewed in Refs. [12] [13] [14] .",

Extracellular expression of F1S1 was facilitated by its N-terminus fusion to the SPUsp45 which is the signal peptide of Usp45, the major extracellular secretary protein in L. lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363 (NCBI GenBank accession number: EU382094.1). Restriction enzyme sites for KpnI and XbaI were added to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the designed fusion gene, accordingly. The nucleotide sequence was optimized according to the codon bias of L. lactis (http://www.jcat.de/) and was synthesized by a service provider (GeneCust, Dudelange, Luxembourg). The synthesized fragment (SECF1S1) was digested with KpnI and XbaI restriction endonucleases (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and was inserted into the corresponding sites of the expression vector pNZ8149, giving rise to pNZ-SECF1S1. A mixture of 2 \u03bcl of pNZ-SECF1S1 and 40 \u03bcl of NZ3900 competent cells were mixed gently and kept on ice for 5 min. The electroporation was carried out using a Gene Pulsar II Electroporator (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA, USA) at field strength of 2.00 kV/cm, capacitance of 25 \u03bcF and resistance of 200 \u03a9, using a 0.2 cm gap electroporation cuvette. Immediately after a single electric pulse, the cells were resuspended in GM17 broth, containing 20 mM MgCl 2 and 2 mM CaCl 2 for 5 min at 4\u00b0C, then incubated for 2 h at 30\u00b0C without any agitation to allow recovery.

The yellow colonies were selected for identification by PCR (primers sefs-F and sefs-R; Table 1 ), restriction enzyme analysis (KpnI and XbaI) and DNA sequencing to confirm lack of mutations and correct ORF of the recombinant construct.

Stimulation of mucosal immunity is considered as an effective strategy against colonization of pathogens and prevention of their spreading into the systemic circulation. However, the parenteral route of vaccine administration confers a limited ability to induce mucosal immunity [17] . Hence, mucosal vaccination may be a more efficacious strategy for vaccine delivery against mucosal invaders. Low immunogenicity is one of the major disadvantages of protein antigens used in mucosal immunizations which has led to the development of vectors that deliver proteins to the target tissues [10] . During the last decade, several studies have confirmed L. lactis potential to express proteins and to induce mucosal immune responses [18] . In addition, the intrinsic Th1 adjuvant activity of L. lactis has been demonstrated in several studies [16, 19] . All of these together make L. lactis a good mucosal delivery vehicle, capable of easily and directly expressing antigens in their native conformation for the low-cost oral or local administration.",

Thus, we added the gene fragment encoding this signal peptide to the 5\u2032 of the F1S1 gene. The fusion F1S1 protein expression with desirable immunogenicity was confirmed by Western blotting. The immunoreactivity of F1S1 protein with sera from mice which had been immunized by commercial DTaP vaccine containing native PT and FHA proteins indicated the maintenance of the immunodominant epitopes of these antigens in the recombinant fusion protein.

            "text": "Several studies suggest that both humoral and cell-mediated immunity are essential for protection against pertussis [21, 22] . It has been shown that B. pertussis infection or immunization with wP vaccines cause primarily a Th1 response [7, 8, 23] . Th1 cytokines are strong activators of natural antimicrobial effector cells such as macrophages and neutrophils and are also inducers of IgG subclasses which promote opsonization, complement-fixation and bactericidal activities [22, 24] . Moreover, secretory IgA has been suggested to play an important role in controlling B. pertussis infection [7, 9, 25] . On the other hand, immunizations with aP vaccines which contain purified proteins of the bacterium and are mainly used in the developed countries promote a predominant Th2 response [8, 26, 27] . It seems that induction of strong Th1 responses and mucosal immunity should be the subject of future investigations. In an attempt to induce both mucosal and appropriate systemic immune responses, we used a live mucosal L. lactis-based vaccine which expressed and secreted F1S1 protein, composed of Nterminally truncated S1 subunit of PT and type I immunodominant domain of FHA from B. pertussis. These parts had the most potent ability to induce the immune responses. The results indicated that mucosal administration of LL-F1S1 to BALB/c mice fulfilled the proper immune responses, namely, induction of Th1 type response and IgA production at the mucosal surfaces. Two strategies for mucosal vaccination, oral and i.n., were investigated in this study. The administration of LL-F1S1 by both routes induced F1S1-specific mucosal and systemic immune responses in BALB/c mice. It was revealed that high levels of IgA in the lung extract and IgG in the sera, as well as higher level of IgG2a compared to IgG1 levels, were produced in all mucosally-immunized mice. Moreover, significant production of IFN-\u03b3 by splenocytes confirmed the induction of Th1 type response. These findings suggest that L. lactis is a suitable vehicle for the delivery of F1S1 fusion protein to mucosa and therefore this approach might provide a novel vaccine against pertussis.",

For instance, L. lactis transformant has been successfully used as a delivery vehicle to express tetanus toxin fragment for oral as well as i.n. inoculations against tetanus toxin challenge in a mouse model [28] . Pei et al. have reported high specific IgG induction in the sera of mice inoculated orally with L. lactis that expressed SARS-coronavirus nucleocapsid protein; however a very weak specific antibody could be detected after i.n. administration [29] . On the other hand, Daniel and colleagues have shown that i.n. administration of a recombinant L. lactis strain, secreting Yersinia pseudotuberculosis low-calcium response V antigen, elicited specific systemic and mucosal antibody and cellular immune responses while no immune response and no protection could be observed with oral administration [30] . They concluded that the antigen and the route of administration are important points that can influence antigen-specific immune responses, induced by L. lactis. The results of the present study indicated comparable levels of serum IgG and lung IgA between the orally and the intranasally immunized mice; while more IFN-\u03b3 and less IgG1 were induced in mice which received LL-F1S1 via i.n. route. Although the i.n. route seems to induce a stronger Th1 response, the priority of each route remains to be seen after challenging the immunized mice with B. pertussis.",

Nowadays, considerable efforts have been devoted to develop new mucosal vectors that could contribute to future vaccines development. In this regards, as an alternative to commercially available whole cell or acellular vaccines, the recombinant L. lactis secreting F1S1 fusion protein would be a promising host for the induction of an appropriate immune response against B. pertussis. In conclusion, this study, represent a step towards the further development of L. lactis as an environmentally safe vaccine against B. pertussis that can be delivered through mucosal administration.",
