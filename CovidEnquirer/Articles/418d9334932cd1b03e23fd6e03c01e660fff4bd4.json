The model reveals three kinetic pathways to \u00c01 PRF that yield two possible frameshift products: those incorporating zero frame encoded A-site tRNAs in the recoding site, and products incorporating \u00c01 frame encoded A-site tRNAs. Using known kinetic rate constants, the individual contributions of different steps of the translation elongation cycle to \u00c01 PRF and the ratio between two types of frameshift products were evaluated. A dual fluorescence reporter was employed in Escherichia coli to empirically test the model. Additionally, the study applied a novel mass spectrometry approach to quantify the ratios of the two frameshift products. A more detailed understanding of the mechanisms underlying \u00c01 PRF may provide insight into developing antiviral therapeutics.",

First, the ribosome selects the cognate aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) according to the codon at the decoding center (decoding, DC in Figure 1 ). Second, the aa-tRNA moves from A/T entry state into the A/A state to be accommodated into the ribosome (aa-tRNA accommodation, AA in Figure 1 ). Third, the ribosome catalyses peptidyltransfer, resulting in a peptidyl tRNA in the A-site and a deacylated tRNA in the P site (peptidyltransfer, PT in Figure 1 ). Fourth, the peptidyl-tRNA moves from the A-site to the P-site, carrying the mRNA along, and the deacylated tRNA moves out of the P-site into the E-site from where it dissociates (translocation, TL in Figure 1 ). Translocation opens up the ribosomal A-site and the ribosome moves on to another round of aa-tRNA selection.",

Tel: +1 302 831 0344; Fax: +1 302 831 4841; Email: KHL@udel.edu Three major models have been proposed for the mechanism of \u00c01 PRF ( Figure 1 ). One hypothesis proposes that \u00c01 PRF takes place during accommodation of the aa-tRNA (8, 15, 16) . We have denoted this Pathway II. The simultaneous-slippage model (8) originally suggested that peptidyl-and aa-tRNAs simultaneously slip by one base in the 5 0 -direction to base pair with the \u00c01 frame codons in the slippery site. In a refinement of this model (15) , \u00c01 PRF was posited to occur when aa-tRNA and peptidyl-tRNA are located in the A/T entry and P/P site. The 9-\u00c5 model of \u00c01 PRF (16) built upon both this and newly available structural data to propose that the $9-\u00c5 movement of the anticodon loop in the 5 0 -direction during aa-tRNA accommodation is constrained by the presence of the downstream stimulatory RNA structural element. This creates tension on the mRNA between the decoding center and the stimulatory element that can be relieved by decoupling of the A-and P-site tRNAs from the mRNA followed by subsequent slippage of the mRNA by one base in the 3 0 -direction relative to the tRNAs, resulting in a net slip reading frame by \u00c01 base. Consistent with this model, mutations altering aa-tRNA accommodation were found to affect \u00c01 PRF (18) (19) (20) . However, the simultaneous slippage-based models do not explain the role of sequences upstream of the slippery site, which have also been shown to affect the \u00c01 PRF efficiency (21, 22) . A second general hypothesis proposes that \u00c01 PRF occurs during translocation. This can be modeled through two discrete kinetic pathways. The first suggested that after peptidyltransfer, the two tRNAs move to P/E and A/P states, followed by an incomplete, two-base translocation event promoted by the downstream mRNA stimulatory structure (23) . During this incomplete translocation event, the tRNAs dissociate from the mRNA and re-pair with the \u00c01 frame codons in the slippery site. We call this Pathway III. In support of this model, cryoelectron microscopy imaging revealed that a \u00c01 PRF stimulating pseudoknot can interact with the ribosome to block the mRNA entrance channel, compromising the translocation process during \u00c01 PRF (24) . The second co-translocational model proposed that incomplete translocation occurs one elongation cycle prior to the model by Weiss et al. (23) , and that tRNAs in the ribosomal E-, P-and A-sites are all involved in the process (22) . This model suggests that incomplete translocation promotes formation of a transition intermediate, and that entry of the new aa-tRNA into the ribosome and the tendency of tRNAs to revert to stable states drives the shift in reading frame. This is Pathway I. This model is supported by the demonstration that mutations altering E-site tRNA binding affect \u00c01 PRF (22) . However, Figure 1 . A mechanistic model of -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting. Two translation elongation cycles are depicted at the top: the ribosome undergoes decoding (DC), aa-tRNA accommodation (AA), peptidyltransfer (PT) and translocation (TL) twice to add two amino acids into the polypeptide sequences. A shift in reading frame may occur at the first TL step and the ribosome decodes a \u00c01 frame A-site codon at the recoding site. Additionally, \u00c01 PRF may occur during the second AA step, in which the ribosome has decoded the zero frame A-site codon. Incorporation of the \u00c01 reading frame aa-tRNA starts at the following cycle. Moreover, the shift in reading frame may occur at the second TL step and incorporation of the \u00c01 reading frame aa-tRNA starts at the following cycle.",

            "text": "Protein sequencing was originally employed to generate the simultaneous slippage model, and to confirm that the \u00c01 PRF site for HIV-1 is U UUU UUA located within the gag/ pol overlap (where the P-site of the ribosome during frameshifting is underlined) (1). Interestingly, $70% of the frameshift products contained Phe-Leu (derived from decoding the 0-frame UUU UUA sequence), while $30% of the products contained Phe-Phe (derived from decoding the \u00c01 frame UUU UUU sequence) at the frameshift site (1, 25) . Previous studies suggested that the product with Phe-Phe at the frameshift site could result from slippage of the P-site tRNA alone (1, 25, 26) , i.e. the product predicted by Pathway I, and that the \u00c01 frame aa-tRNA is subsequently recruited to the ribosome. However, the precise mechanism driving this process remained unclear, and no model has been proposed to date explaining the simultaneous formation of different frameshift proteins. Here, we have developed a kinetic model of \u00c01 PRF to explain all of the experimental observations. This model reveals the major steps in the translation elongation cycle that affect \u00c01 PRF, and reconciles all three models of \u00c01 PRF. In addition, \u00c01 PRF efficiency was monitored in vivo using a dual fluorescence reporter (27) and the compositions of different frameshift proteins were analysed by mass spectrometry. The experimental approach was also applied to study Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV) pro-pol frameshift sequence. This is the first study to demonstrate and quantify the ratio of frameshift products incorporating \u00c01 frame A-site tRNA at this \u00c01 PRF sequence. In agreement with the model predictions, experimental perturbation of different translation steps resulted in different levels of \u00c01 PRF efficiency as well as in the relative ratios of two types of frameshift proteins. Our findings demonstrate that all three kinetic pathways are operative during \u00c01 PRF.",

A similar approach can be applied to understand the mechanism of \u00c01 PRF. The mechanistic model in the present study proposes that \u00c01 PRF can occur during translocation and/or aa-tRNA accommodation. Figure 1 describes the overall framework using abc deX XXY YYZ fgh sequence as an example, where spaces separate zero frame codons and the slippery sequence is underlined. When \u00c01 PRF occurs during translocation, the presence of the downstream stimulatory structure forces the ribosome to translocate by two, rather than three, bases toward the 3 0 -end of the mRNA, thus shifting the reading frame. If this 'incomplete' translocation occurs to the pre-translocational ribosome aligning with deX XXY, translation of the \u00c01 frame begins at YYY. Alternatively, if incomplete translocation occurs to the pre-translocational ribosome aligning with XXY YYZ, translation of the \u00c01 frame starts at Zfg. When \u00c01 PRF occurs during aa-tRNA accommodation, the two tRNAs interacting with XXY YYZ slip to base pair with XXX YYY. Consequently, translation of \u00c01 frame starts at Zfg (Figure 1 ).",

            "text": "An elegant series of biochemical analyses have established detailed kinetic models of translocation (28) and aa-tRNA selection (29) . Translocation involves EF-G binding to the pre-translocational ribosome, GTP hydrolysis, unlocking conformation change, Pi release, tRNA movement, relocking conformation change and dissociation of EF-G from the post-translocational ribosome. This concept is illustrated along the top of Figure 2 from component PA (pre-translocational ribosome) to E 0 P 0 (post-translocational ribosome). Detailed descriptions for each rate constant are shown in Supplementary Table S1 . Selection and accommodation of aa-tRNA involves initial binding of the ternary complex EF-Tu:aa-tRNA:GTP, codon recognition, EF-Tu GTPase activation, GTP hydrolysis, dissociation of EF-Tu from the ribosome and accommodation of the acceptor end of the aa-tRNA into the A-site or the rejection of the aa-tRNA by proofreading. Detailed descriptions for each rate constant are shown in Supplementary Table S2. In the absence of frameshifting, progression through these steps of the elongation cycle results in synthesis of the non-frameshift protein, called NFS ( Figure 2 ). Our kinetic model suggests three possible reaction pathways that could generate \u00c01 frameshift proteins ( Figure 2 ). In Pathway I, blockage of the mRNA channel entrance by the downstream stimulatory structure induces incomplete translocation with the pre-translocational ribosome positioned at deX XXY. Specifically, the reading frame shift occurs between the tRNA movement and Pi release (rate constant r TL0 ), and the relocking step (rate constant r 45 ). Weiss et al. (23) suggested that when the two tRNAs move from P/E and A/P to the E/E and P/P states, they can un-pair from the mRNA and re-pair with the \u00c01 reading frame. In our model, r t represents the rate constant for a ribosome:EF-G:GDP complex with two tRNAs in the E-and P-sites (E 0 P 0 EFGgdp ) to re-pair with the \u00c01 reading frame (E 02 P 02 EFGgdp ). This motion is reversible, as denoted by the r -t rate constant. This step is followed by a relocking conformational change and EF-G release from the ribosome complex. The resulting E 0 P 0 or E 02 P 02 (A-site unocupied) then moves on to the aa-tRNA selection step. Here, E 0 P 0 is the posttranslocational ribosome aligning with deX XXY (zero frame) and E 02 P 02 is the post-translocational ribosome aligning with cde XXX (-1 frame), where subscript 0 means a zero frame tRNA pairing with the zero frame; subscript 02 means a zero frame tRNA pairing with the \u00c01 frame. E 0 P 0 may generate non-frameshift product NFS, or enter Pathway II or III described below. E 02 P 02 can generate frameshift product FS m , which incorporates the \u00c01 frame aa-tRNA in the recoding site (YYY). In addition, it is also possible for E 02 P 02 to recruit a zero frame aa-tRNA for YYZ (A 0 ) and accommodate this aa-tRNA into the \u00c01 frame. In this case, frameshift product FS z , which incorporates the zero frame aa-tRNA in the recoding site (YYZ), is produced (Pathway Ia).",

Two parameters play important roles in Pathway I in the kinetic model. Here, r t represents the rate constant for incomplete translocation. An increase in r t while other parameters in the model remain constant leads to an increase in FS% (blue line in Figure 4a ). Both the levels of FS m and FS z increase when r t increases (green and red lines in Figure 4a ). Because the rise in the FS m level is larger, increasing r t results in a larger FS m fraction (Figure 4b ). It is also interesting to note that the majority of FS z comes from Pathway III when r t is <2 s \u00c01 , while the majority of FS z is from pathway II when r t is >2 s \u00c01 (Figure 4b) . The rate constant r 45 accounts for the relocking step during translocation. A decrease in r 45 while other parameters in the model remain constant results in an increase in FS% (blue line in Figure 5a ). Both the levels of FS m and FS z increase when r 45 decreases (green and red lines in Figure 5a ). However, in this case the increase in the FS m level is larger, leading to a larger FS m fraction with a decrease in r 45 (Figure 5b) . Here, the majority of FS z is from Pathway III when r 45 is <22 s \u00c01 , but the majority of FS z results from pathway II when r 45 becomes >22 s \u00c01 ( Figure  5b) . These results suggest that translocation perturbations by either a downstream mRNA secondary structure, by mutations, or by chemical inhibitors may result in production of a higher FS%, primarily due to production of a larger amount of FS m . Notably, manipulating r t values causes larger changes in FS% and in the FS m fraction compared to the effect of r 45 , suggesting a dominant role by r t on \u00c01 PRF in Pathway I. Consistent with our model, experimental studies demonstrated that mutating the E-site codon in the recoding site, or the use of a translocation inhibitor altered FS% (22) .",

The model predicts that a smaller k pt should cause higher FS% and a lower fraction of FS m (Figure 8) . A prior study using yeast demonstrated that inhibition of peptidyltransfer promoted increased rates of \u00c01 PRF, but did not differentiate between FS m and FS z products (36) . The model predicts that addition of chloramphenicol, a potent peptidyltransferase inhibitor in bacteria (37), should promote increased FS%. Consistent with the model, a 2.1-fold increase in FS% exp was observed in the E. coli culture containing 0.75 mg/ml chloramphenicol compared to the culture without the drug. The fractions of FS m for the culture with and without chloramphenicol were 17.3 and 20.4%, respectively (Figure 9a) . Although a slight decrease in the fraction of FS m was observed in the presence of the drug, the difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05).",

The model predicts that a larger r t should result in a higher FS% due to increased production of FS m . Consistently, 1.2-and 1.4-fold increase in FS% exp are observed for the MB2UCC and MB2CCC strains compared to the MB2 strain, respectively (Figure 9b ). In the MB2UCC strain, 76.4% of the frameshift products were FS m , and in the MB2CCC strain, 90.3% of the frameshift products were FS m .

To our knowledge, this is the first kinetic model to explain the production of two types of \u00c01 frameshift proteins through three distinct kinetic pathways.

Additionally, Pathway II predicts that a ribosome can change reading frame due to simultaneous slippage of P-and A-site tRNAs for a ribosome aligning with XXY YYZ, generating a frameshift product (FS z ) incorporating the zero frame aa-tRNA in the frameshift site (codon YYZ).

Previous studies suggested that FS m may result from slippage of a single P-site tRNA (1, 25, 26) . However, it is not clear when and/or how this could occur. In addition, the single slippage model does not explain experimental evidence regarding the influence of translocation on \u00c01 PRF (22, 23) . Our model suggests that in both mechanisms, incomplete translocation and slippage of P-and A-site tRNAs participate in synthesizing frameshift proteins to varying extents for different \u00c01 PRF signals. Frameshifting at the HIV-1 sequence was reported to generate $70% FS z and 30% FS m (1, 25) , indicating that Pathways II and/or III exert stronger influence on FS% than Pathway I. Notably, our protein analysis showed $80% FS z and 20% FS m for the frameshifting signal in HIV-1 group M subtype B. This small discrepancy may due to the use of different reporter systems, or differences in the quantitative methods employed for the assay. For the HTLV-1 pro-pol frameshift sequence, this study observed 39.4% FS m in total frameshift protein. This is the first study to demonstrate another frameshift sequence that generates a significant amount of FS m in addition to HIV-1. Interestingly, a small but observable lysine peak appeared at the corresponding position (-1 frame A-site codon in the recoding site) when HTLV-1 pro-pol frameshift proteins were sequenced in the previous study (31) , supporting the production of FS m . The stimulatory RNA of HTLV-1 pro-pol has been suggested to be a pseudoknot (31) , although no direct evidence for the RNA structure was shown in the same study. Interestingly, the mouse Edr frameshift sequence, which shares high similarity with the HTLV-1 pro-pol sequence, was suggested to involve a pseudoknot (38) . Because the length of HTLV-1 pro-pol stimulatory signals is not well-defined, the frameshift sequence incorporated in the TLV strain may not represent the whole stimulatory signal. However, the possible absence of a portion of the stimulatory signal did not prevent us from observing a significant amount of frameshift efficiency and the ratio of FS m to the total frameshift protein. Frameshift products from other \u00c01 PRF signals were analysed previously (39, 40) . For SARS-CoV frameshifting, FS m was not found (39) . However, for the Alphavirus coding sequence 6k, both FS z and FS m were identified in the frameshift products, although the exact ratio was not determined (40) .",

For HIV-1 and HTLV-1, experimental results indicate that 20.4 and 39.4%, respectively, of frameshift proteins are FS m , i.e. the contribution of Pathway I. Although the experimental approach cannot differentiate between the relative contributions of Pathways II and III to FS z production, the kinetic model can be used to discriminate between the effects of these two pathways. In the kinetic model, r t , k pas2 and r t3 represent non-regular events, which are likely to be ratelimiting steps. These rate constants are thus expected to be small. The values for r 45 and k pt are 5 and 50 s \u00c01 , respectively (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). As shown in Figures 4-8 , r t , r 45 , k pas2 , and r t3 are all in the small value ranges, and k pt at 50 s \u00c01 , suggest that Pathway III contributes approximately equal or more to the FS z production than does Pathway II. Interestingly, inhibition of peptidyltransfer (decreasing k pt ) can switch to a condition in which Pathway II contributes more to FS z production than Pathway III (Figure 8b ). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the \u00c01 PRF signals of different viruses have evolved within these kinetic parameters so as to produce the optimal ratios of shifted to unshifted products according to their specific biological requirements.",

Notably, our experimental results show that in one case, FS% increases significantly without a change in the composition of frameshift products (Figure 9a) , while in another condition FS% increases a smaller amount but the composition of frameshift products change dramatically (Figure 9b) .",

The rate constants for translocation and aa-tRNA selection range from 0.47 to 1980 s \u00c01 (Supplementary Tables S1-S4). The average protein synthesis rate is 10-20 s \u00c01 in prokaryotic cells but some codons are translated at a rate <10 s \u00c01 (42). Therefore, a broad range (1-100 s \u00c01 ), within the scope of the known elongation rate constants, was tested to understand the impact each of these unknown parameters on \u00c01 frameshifting (Figures 4, 6 and 7) . Notably, these figures do not show the impact of these parameters >100 s \u00c01 because the curves level off for the parameters at this range.",

In addition, the model identifies the dominant parameters, representing steps in the translation elongation cycle, on \u00c01 PRF. Experimentally targeting these steps resulted in different levels of frameshifting efficiency, consistent with model predictions. A mutation in the \u00c01 frame E-site sequence was shown to dramatically change the composition of frameshift products, suggesting an important role for the sequence upstream of the slippery site. Our results suggest that not only the frameshift efficiency, but also the compositions of the frameshift products, are worth investigating to advance our knowledge of \u00c01 PRF.",
