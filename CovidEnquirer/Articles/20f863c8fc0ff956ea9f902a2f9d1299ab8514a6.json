If the virus genome has two or more segments, each segment is registered in a single flat file. Complete genome/segment data were identified by the description in the definition line of the flat file. We extracted genome records with the words 'complete genome' and without the words 'Third Party Annotation (TPA)' or 'nearly complete' in the definition line of the flat file. Segment records were extracted with a combination of the words 'segment' and 'complete sequence', and without the words 'TPA' or 'nearly complete' in the definition line of the flat file. These records were obtained from the virus division or the phage division of the DDBJ database. We extracted and stored 18 418 complete virus genome/segment data sets from release 66, which was the latest DDBJ data released at the time of the initial development of GIB-V (Table 1) .
