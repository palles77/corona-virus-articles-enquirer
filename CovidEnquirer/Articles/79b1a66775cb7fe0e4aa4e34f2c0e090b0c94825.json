            "text": "Seizure disorders in cats present a significant diagnostic challenge and may result from primary intracranial disease or extracranial disease. Seizures can be classified as focal, partial, or generalized. 34 A focal seizure is one in which there is spontaneous discharge of neurons of the prosencephalon in the absence of clinical signs and that may be present in the interictal period but is detectable only with use of an electroencephalogram (EEG). A partial seizure is a focal seizure that may be observed clinically and consists of varying degrees of motor or sensory abnormalities in the absence of loss of consciousness. A simple partial seizure results in abnormal motor activity such as twitching, tremors, limb flexion, ptyalism, facial twitching, and mydriasis with no alteration in sensorium. A complex partial seizure may resemble the simple partial seizure, but changes in the mental status are evident, including maniacal running, staring into space, aggression, and self-inflicted trauma. 34 Generalized seizures (grand mal) are more easily recognized by pet owners and result in loss of consciousness, recumbency, tonic-clonic muscle activity in the limbs, chewing movements, ptyalism, mydriasis, and loss of stool and urine. 34 The seizure type does not necessarily reflect underlying etiology, 114 although seizure pattern in cats is reportedly different from that of dogs, with complex partial seizures being more common than generalized seizures. 109 Cluster seizures are defined as more than two seizures in a 24-hour period, whereas status epilepticus (SE) is a seizure lasting more than 5 minutes or multiple seizures between which there is no recovery. 34 Structural brain disease has been identified as the most common cause of seizures in cats and includes meningoencephalitis, feline ischemic encephalopathy, neoplasia, trauma, abscess, and vascular disorders. 4, 109 However, idiopathic epilepsy (defined as recurrent seizures in the absence of an underlying cause) is an important and often definitive diagnosis could not be made after CSF analysis in 37% of cats. 17 Processing of CSF is typically done by a clinical pathologist and may include evaluation of the following parameters: color, turbidity, specific gravity, protein concentration, red blood cell count, nucleated cell count and differential analysis, and glucose concentration. In cases of specific infectious diseases, culture and sensitivity, gram stain, infectious disease titers, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays may be indicated. Cytologic analysis should be performed using a hemocytometer after concentration of the sample because of the typically low number of cells present in CSF, even in the face of inflammatory disease.",

For collection from the cerebellomedullary cistern, the cat is placed in right lateral recumbency for a right-handed clinician with the neck flexed. The wings of the atlas and occipital protuberance are palpated and an imaginary line drawn between the wings of the atlas and the point where this line transects midline. The spinal needle is inserted slowly, with frequent removal of the stylet to evaluate CSF flow. When the subarachnoid space is entered, the CSF (at least 1 mL) can be allowed to passively drip into a sterile glass tube. 17 Collection from the lumbar cistern can be performed with the patient in sternal or right or left lateral recumbency. In cats fluid is typically collected from the L6-7 overlooked cause of seizures in cats, accounting for 25% of cases in one report of 91 cats. 114 Cats with idiopathic epilepsy tended to be younger than those with structural brain disease, with a mean age of 3.5 years in two publications. 114, 126 Feline hippocampal necrosis should also be considered in the differential diagnosis for a seizuring cat. It is characterized by acute onset seizures and behavioral changes in young to middle-aged cats with poor response to conventional anticonvulsant therapy and progressively worsening signs. 40 Histopathologic findings include severe, diffuse, bilateral necrosis of neurons in the hippocampus and piriform lobes. 40 Prognosis is guarded.",

            "text": "Evaluation of affected cats requires a thorough history and neurologic exam, as well as consideration of the breed, age, and vaccine history of the patient. A thorough description of the seizure as well as duration, frequency, and the presence or absence of interictal abnormalities are vital to formulate a diagnostic plan. An initial minimum database should include a complete blood count, chemistry panel, blood pressure measurement, urinalysis, and testing for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Thoracic radiographs, abdominal ultrasonography, echocardiography, bile acid assessment, and thyroid testing may all be part of the workup, depending on the results of the physical examination, history, and preliminary testing. If a metabolic or systemic cause is ruled out through the preliminary workup, advanced imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is indicated. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most reliable imaging modality for the diagnosis of structural diseases of the brain on account of its superior anatomic detail. 4, 34 CSF analysis is an invaluable resource in the diagnosis of many primary encephalopathies, but findings are rarely specific and results must be interpreted in light of clinical and MRI findings. CSF analysis infrequently provides a definitive diagnosis, unless infectious agents such as Cryptococcus (Figure 27 -1) or neoplastic cells are identified. In one report, despite extensive evaluation, a starting dose of 2.5 mg/kg, administered orally every 12 hours, is recommended, 133 but serum PB concentrations vary greatly among individuals on the same dosage, which suggests that there are differences in elimination kinetics among populations of cats. 23 These differences emphasize the need for individual monitoring of cats receiving PB, 23 and researchers recommend more frequent monitoring of PB levels in cats compared with dogs. 108 Elimination of PB may be accelerated in cats receiving steroids and in kittens, which suggests a probable need for higher dosing in these individuals. 108 Toxicity is extremely unusual in cats receiving therapeutic doses but may include thrombocytopenia, facial pruritus, neutropenia, or swelling of the feet. 108 Hepatotoxicity is equally rare. The author suggests checking PB levels approximately 10 days after initiation of therapy or after a change in dose, as well as every 4 months along with a complete blood count, chemistry panel, and assessment of bile acids. Samples can be drawn at any time during the day.",

Toxicity is reportedly low, but approximately half the cats in one study developed adverse reactions such as anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, somnolence, and ataxia. 52 Further studies are needed regarding efficacy and pharmacokinetics of this drug, but anecdotally, a starting dose of 5 mg/kg, administered orally once daily, has proved effective in a number of cases. intervertebral space.

Many patients with neurologic disease are poor anesthetic candidates, and clinicians should carefully consider the risk-to-benefit ratio, as well as take special precautions in anesthetizing these cases. Ketamine is considered relatively unsafe in patients with disorders of the brain because of its potential to increase intracranial pressure, whereas propofol is relatively safe as an induction agent.

Typical findings on MRI (Figure 27 -3) include varying degrees of ventricular dilation, reduction of periventricular white matter, expansion of the cranial cavity, and loss of cortical bone. Treatment of congenital hydrocephalus may include medical management with the aim of reducing CSF volume and production through the use of diuretics and corticosteroids. 22 Furosemide at a dose of 0.5 to 4.4 mg/ kg PO, IV, IM, every 12 to 24 hours, may be used to decrease CSF production through inhibition of the sodium-potassium cotransport system. 22 Acetazolamide (Diamox) may be used in a similar fashion at 10 mg/ kg PO, every 8 hours; it acts to decrease CSF production through inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. 22 Prednisone A B the CNS. 34 Hypoglycemia is a well-recognized cause of seizures in pediatric patients and has also been reported infrequently in older cats with insulinoma or other insulin-secreting tumors. 50, 67 Additional causes include hepatic disease, sepsis, lysosomal storage diseases, inadvertent overdose of insulin, and hypoadrenocorticism. 67 Clinical signs associated with neuroglycopenia in addition to seizures may include lethargy, weakness, disorientation, ataxia, and visual deficits.

Administration of thiamine (10 to 25 mg administered intramuscularly and followed by oral supplementation) will result in complete resolution of clinical signs. If the condition is left untreated, signs progress to prostration, opisthotonos and spasticity, coma, and death. 30 On postmortem examination, petechial hemorrhages are found bilaterally in the brain stem, with degenerative lesions found in the caudal colliculi, lateral geniculate, vestibular, oculomotor, and habenular nuclei. 30",

PCR can be performed on CSF and other fluids (e.g., abdominal effusion) or tissues, but its sensitivity is relatively low, and a negative test does not necessarily rule out FIP. 42 Postmortem examination of the brain often reveals gross lesions, including meningeal opacity around the medulla and choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle and coating of the choroid plexuses with a white tenacious exudate. 32 Ependymal cells may be coated by fibrin and may lead to hydrocephalus rostral to the obstruction. Histologically, there is a severe pyogranulomatous leptomeningitis, choroiditis, ependymitis, and encephalomyelitis, with lesions predominantly surface oriented. 32 Prognosis is extremely grim, and despite claims of effective treatments for FIP, it appears that the disease is uniformly fatal, even with supportive care and immunomodulatory therapies.",

Complete blood count findings are nonspecific, but serum protein concentration is often elevated, specifically the alpha-2, beta, and gamma-globulins. 35 CSF analysis in cats with FIP is characterized by increased cellularity (which may be predominantly neutrophilic or mononuclear), as well as increased protein levels as high as 2 g/L. The presence of anti-coronavirus antibodies in either serum or CSF proves only that the cat has been exposed to a coronavirus and is not a means of definitively diagnosing FIP. In a prospective study of 67 cats, detection of anticoronavirus antibodies in CSF had a sensitivity of 60% and a specificity of 90%. 11 MRI is a useful adjunctive tool in cases of suspected intracranial FIP, both to help confirm the diagnosis and rule out other causes of neurologic signs ( Figure 27 A B and may yield neutrophilic, eosinophilic, mononuclear, or mixed pleocytosis with elevated protein. 74 MRI of affected cats is variable and may include a solitary granuloma, multifocal masses, meningeal inflammation, and enhancement of the ependyma and choroid plexuses. 130 Microscopic findings include the presence of numerous, tightly packed organisms filling the subarachnoid space and expanding the sulci with a mild nonsuppurative inflammatory response in the meninges and parenchyma ( Figure 27 -10). 32 The treatment of choice is currently fluconazole (25 to 50 mg orally every 12 hours) because of its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, its relative safety margin, and its reported efficacy. 74 However, prognosis is considered extremely guarded in cats with CNS involvement and relapses are common. Other fungal infections, such as Blastomyces dermatitidis, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Cladophialophora spp., are sporadically reported in endemic areas and are typically associated with a grave prognosis. 74, 127 Borna Disease",

Cats that have recovered have permanent ataxia, behavioral changes, and polyphagia. 9 Definitive diagnosis can be difficult, and other causes of multifocal CNS disturbances, such as FIP, must be ruled out. Fewer than half of affected cats test positive for BDV-specific antibodies, and PCR has not proved to be a reliable test in this species. 9 The disease can be definitively diagnosed only through postmortem examination. Findings include inflammatory changes, mostly in gray matter, perivascular cuffing, neuronophagia, and detection of BDV antigen in the CNS parenchyma. 9 Prognosis is grave, and there is no known treatment. Many other infectious encephalitides in cats have been reported uncommonly, including rabies, FIV, rickettsial disease, pseudorabies, and feline spongiform encephalopathy.",

Because cats with cryptococcosis frequently are infected through inhalation of unencapsulated organisms, it is not unusual for the cat to have concurrent upper respiratory signs as well as swelling of the nose. 74 Clinical signs usually reflect a multifocal process, but forebrain signs may predominate because of the proposed route of entry. Ocular involvement often accompanies lesions in the CNS, with organisms being found between the choroid and the retina. 32 There is no significant age or sex predilection, and both indoor and outdoor cats can become infected.",

            "text": "Plant toxicities account for approximately 10% of reported exposures to poison control centers, with more than 50% of cases being less than 1 year of age. 58 These are often particularly challenging to the clinician because many pet owners do not know the names of the plants the cat may have ingested, and in some cases it is unclear whether the animal did in fact ingest the plant material. Tobacco, marijuana, and other hallucinogenic plants have all been reported to cause a multitude of signs, from depression to ataxia, seizures, and death. 58 Ingestion of lead continues to be an important toxicologic problem in cats, particularly in those living in homes constructed before 1977. Owners of cats with suspected lead poisoning should be questioned carefully to determine whether remodeling is taking place because the grooming habits of cats put them at risk for ingesting lead-containing particles. 36 Neurologic signs, including behavioral changes, seizures, blindness, and ataxia usually develop after acute, high-level lead exposure. 36 In cats gastrointestinal signs (e.g., vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, constipation, and megaesophagus) are more common than neurologic signs. The diagnosis of lead poisoning can be confirmed by measuring a blood lead level greater than 0.22 ppm. 36 Although numerous other toxins have the potential to affect the nervous system in cats, a complete discussion is beyond the scope of this chapter; the reader is neurologic examination, is essential. Although the list of potential neurotoxins is endless, this section addresses only the most common and clinically relevant ones seen by feline practitioners (see also Chapter 31). 25 Topical pesticides represent a significant source of toxicity in cats and usually result from inappropriate administration of flea and tick products. Clinical signs of permethrin toxicity include tremors and muscle fasciculations, twitching, hyperesthesia, seizures, ataxia, mydriasis, and central blindness. Severe clinical signs require intensive treatment, and left unchecked, death from aspiration pneumonia, respiratory arrest, or electrolyte abnormalities may result. However, the majority of cats will have a good outcome with no long-term complications. 12, 37 Organophosphate and carbamate insecticides act by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, resulting in signs consistent with a \"cholinergic crisis\" marked by muscarinic, nicotinic, and mixed signs. 36 Tremors, depression, seizures, miosis, abnormal behavior, and cervical ventroflexion all have been reported in affected cats within minutes to hours after exposure. 36 A number of drugs have been reported to cause neurologic signs in cats, the most well described being metronidazole. 16, 112 Neurologic signs include disorientation, ataxia, central blindness, and seizures. All reported cases have been on doses greater than 30 mg/kg per day. Withdrawal of the medication and institution of supportive care result in rapid resolution of clinical signs within several days. 16, 112 Ivermectin is also reported to referred elsewhere for an excellent review of veterinary toxicology. 103",

            "text": "Cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) are becoming recognized in veterinary medicine with increasing frequency because of the greater availability of MRI. CVAs can be divided into two broad categories: ischemic stroke, in which a vessel is occluded by thrombus or vasospasm, and hemorrhagic stroke, which arises from rupture of blood vessels into CNS parenchyma or subarachnoid space. 45 The incidence of CVA in cats is unknown, insofar as the majority of reports in the veterinary literature are based on canine studies. Risk factors include hyperfibrinogenemia, polycythemia, coagulopathies, neoplasia (e.g., intravascular lymphoma), hypertension, multiple myeloma, cardiac disease, infectious diseases (e.g., FIP), renal disease, vasculitis, and others. 45, 53, 55 Postanesthetic cerebellar ischemia has been reported in Persian cats after anesthesia with ketamine. 116 Clinical signs reflect the location and extent of the affected area and are usually acute in onset and asymmetric, with minimal progression after the first 24 hours. The cerebellum is the most common site for vascular accidents to occur, 19,34 but the cerebral hemispheres and thalamus are also frequently affected. A minimum database in any cat with suspected brain infarction should include a complete blood count, chemistry panel, FeLV and FIV testing, urinalysis, thyroid panel if applicable, coagulation profile if applicable, multiple blood pressure measurements, electrocardiogram, and possible thoracic radiographs and abdominal ultrasound. If cardiomyopathy is suspected, echocardiography should also be performed. Definitive diagnosis requires advanced imaging of the brain, with MRI considered the superior modality for detecting intracranial infarction ( Figure  27 -11). Findings may vary depending on the amount of time that has elapsed between the onset of the stroke and performance of imaging. Typical abnormalities noted on MRI include a focal, sharply demarcated lesion that is hyperintense on T2 and FLAIR images, hypointense on T1, with a discrete cutoff between normal and abnormal tissue. Mass effect or midline shifting is usually not seen, and there is minimal, if any, contrast enhancement.",

            "text": "A unique vascular disorder of the CNS, feline ischemic encephalopathy is well described in cats and thought to be related to Cuterebra larvae myasis. 34, 47 Affected cats typically have access to the outdoors and present in summer and early fall with unilateral prosencephalic signs, including progressive seizures, behavioral changes (often aggression), blindness, and depression. In some cases neurologic signs are preceded by signs of upper respiratory disease, including sneezing. 47 Abnormal rectal temperatures, either hyperthermia or hypothermia, were noted. 47 Neither routine hematology nor CSF analysis is specific for this disorder. MRI of the brain (Figure 27 -12) may show parasitic track lesions, as well as cerebrocortical degeneration caused by toxin release by the parasite. 34 Grossly, marked atrophy of the affected cerebral hemisphere can be apparent (Figure 27-13) . Vasospasm secondary to release of toxin produced by the parasite results in infarction in the region perfused by the middle cerebral artery or its branches. 34 Histologic findings include parasitic track lesions, superficial laminar cerebrocortical necrosis, cerebral infarction, subependymal rarefaction, and subpial astrogliosis. 146 Larvae are most commonly found in the olfactory bulbs and peduncles, optic nerves, and cribriform plate, suggesting entry from the nasal cavity. 146 falling, vomiting, rolling, wide-based stance, loss of equilibrium, and vestibular quality ataxia. 34 It is of key importance that the clinician recognizes whether the signs are due to peripheral or central disturbances of the vestibular system; this is primarily ascertained with a thorough neurologic examination and history (Table  27 -2). The presence of a head tilt and vestibular-quality ataxia can be seen with either peripheral or central disease; however, paresis, spasticity, hypermetria, or postural deficits are suggestive of a central lesion. Likewise, horizontal or rotary nystagmus with the fast phase opposite the side of the lesion can be seen in both central and peripheral disease, but vertical nystagmus is typically seen with central disease. Nystagmus with a fast phase directed toward the side of the lesion or that changes with changing position of the head is consistent with a central lesion. 34 The presence of cranial nerve abnormalities (other than VII) is also more common with central lesions, whereas Horner's syndrome is more often seen with peripheral dysfunction. Bilateral peripheral vestibular disease is characterized by a crouched gait, wide head excursions, absent oculocephalic reflex, and a wide-based stance. 34 It should be noted that blueeyed cats often have a resting pendular nystagmus because of the larger portions of axons of the optic nerve crossing in the chiasm compared with normal animals. This is of no clinical significance and occurs in the absence of other vestibular signs. 34 There are myriad causes of vestibular signs in cats, but this section covers only those affecting the peri pheral vestibular system. Common causes of peripheral disease in cats include feline idiopathic peripheral vestibular disease, otitis media-interna (OMI), nasopharyngeal Treatment options are extremely limited, and most cats are euthanized because of severe neurologic impairment and aggression.",

A thorough neurologic assessment is necessary to determine lesion location, with careful attention paid to gait, postural responses, and segmental reflexes. Although many feline patients are reluctant to walk in the clinical setting, the provision of adequate space, a quiet setting, and nonslippery flooring may facilitate the examination. The unique temperament of many cats, difficulty with gait evaluation in this species, and the fact that many live outdoors and thus are less closely observed than other species further impede the assessment of feline patients.

Because the embryologic development of the spine is closely related to development of other body systems, a thorough examination of the patient should be performed to assess viability. Although many spinal anomalies occur sporadically, the possibility of a genetic basis in potential breeding animals should be carefully considered. Animals with anomalies of the spinal cord will have clinical signs present from birth, whereas those with vertebral anomalies may not show evidence of a myelopathy until skeletally mature. The Manx cat has been the subject of numerous reports of spinal anomalies because of its caudal vertebral aplasia specifically selected for in breeding programs. The trait is inherited as an autosomal dominant gene and in the homozygous state is lethal, whereas variable expression is seen in heterozygotes. 34 Associated with this anomaly is a high incidence of sacrocaudal spina bifida and meningoceles; meningomyeloceles; and myelodysplasia of the caudal lumbar, sacral, and caudal segments. 30 Specifically, spina bifida involves failure of the dorsal elements of the vertebrae to form during development and may occur alone in the absence of other clinical signs (spina bifida occulta). Spina bifida may occur in conjunction with meningocele (protrusion of meninges and CSF outside the vertebral canal) or meningomyelocele (protrusion of meninges, CSF, and neural tissue outside the vertebral canal) (Figure 27-21) . in a cat, which succumbed to respiratory arrest several days after a ventral slot at C2-3. 85 Diagnostic testing can include CT scan or MRI, and most frequently will reveal a single extradural compressive lesion (Figure 27-20) . MRI may also reveal loss of the normal signal from the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disk, narrowing of the ventral subarachnoid space, and displacement of the spinal cord or epidural fat. With increasing availability of advanced imaging modalities, myelography is becoming less commonly used, but it still remains a viable means of diagnosing this disorder. Plain radiographs are of little value in definitively diagnosing IVDD but may help rule out other causes of myelopathy, such as fracture or osteosarcoma.",

However, histopathologic examination of 33 cats revealed 87.9% to have both intradural and extradural components, with 42.9% of cats examined having concurrent lymphoma in the brain. 83 Diagnosis of spinal lymphoma requires a high index of suspicion and careful attention to involvement of other body systems. Hematologic abnormalities are frequently found and include anemia, leukopenia, progressing to paralysis. 15 The clinical course involved gradually progressive neurologic dysfunction resulting in euthanasia. Microscopically, white-matter degeneration with dilation of myelin sheaths and swollen axons was identified in the spinal cord and brain stem of affected animals.

Myelography generally is abnormal, but lesion location (e.g., intramedullary versus extramedullary) may not always be delineated on the basis of this modality alone, and the presence of an extradural lesion does not distinguish lymphoma from other tumor types. CT in combination with myelography is likely to provide greater detail regarding the extent and location of the lesion, whereas MRI increases the ability to visualize the spinal cord and surrounding structures in a less invasive manner. Plain radiographs of the vertebral column are of little value in attaining a diagnosis, with bony lysis being detected very infrequently. 83 CSF collected from the lumbar spine may show elevated protein and white blood cells, predominantly lymphocytes, although abnormal CSF is seen more commonly in dogs because of their higher incidence of leptomeningeal involvement. Occasionally, lymphoblasts ( Figure  27 -23) can be seen, and in one report neoplastic lymphocytes were identified on CSF analysis in 6 of 17 cats evaluated. 72 Treatment options depend on tumor location, histologic grade, extent of CNS involvement, and whether multicentric disease is present. Chemotherapy, either alone or in combination with other modalities, has been shown to be beneficial. In one study of cats treated with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone, complete remission was attained in 50% of cases, with a Confirmatory testing begins with conventional radiography and may require sedation, anesthesia, or both. However, the potential for iatrogenic potentiation of spinal trauma exists during handling and positioning of the anesthetized patient, and extreme care must be exercised as such. Complete vertebral radiographs should be taken because a second fracture of the spine is seen in up to 20% of cases. 73 Advanced imaging in the form of myelography (Figure 27-25 ), CT scan, or MRI provides additional information regarding the extent of the injury and may assist in surgical planning and for prognostic purposes.",

Cats with mild signs such as minor pain, ambulatory paresis, motor deficits, and stable fractures are good candidates for attempting medical management. However, early decompressive surgery may be associated with a more favorable outcome and is considered the best option for animals with unstable fractures, unrelenting pain, severe paresis or paraplegia, or progressive signs. In human studies early surgical intervention reduced complications, length of hospital stay, and cost of care in patients with traumatic spinal injury. 69 Additionally, early decompression alleviates the compression and thus decreases the cascade of secondary events. 69 Routine use of corticosteroids has fallen out of favor in recent years for a number of reasons. Dexamethasone, once considered the drug of choice for initial treatment in spinal injuries, has not been shown to inhibit the secondary detrimental effects of trauma on the CNS and is associated with a greater incidence of adverse effects in veterinary patients. Experimental studies in animals suggest that only soluble glucocorticoids (e.g., methylprednisolone sodium succinate) given within 8 hours of injury are of benefit, 102 but adverse effects are common and include gastrointestinal hemorrhage, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, and hypotension. neoplasms. 83 Vertebral bodies and dorsal lamina are more frequently affected than the dorsal or transverse processes. Additional radiographic signs that may help with antemortem diagnosis include widening of the intervertebral foramen, expansion of the vertebral canal, thinning of the bone, or pathologic fractures. Advanced imaging is indicated even when a lesion is identified on radiography for the purpose of further defining the extent of the lesion and for surgical planning.

Although surgical intervention may not always achieve complete resection of the mass, cytoreduction will alleviate clinical signs and allow for histopathologic confirmation of tumor type. In a retrospective study of 26 cats undergoing surgery alone for nonlymphoid vertebral and spinal cord neoplasms, the median survival times for malignant (e.g., osteosarcoma) and benign (e.g., meningioma) tumors were 110.5 and 518 days, respectively. 111 In another report one cat with meningioma was alive 1400 days postoperatively, and another was alive 2190 days after resection of a nerve sheath neoplasm. 78 Overall, it appears that surgical treatment, even when complete resection is not possible, will palliate clinical signs and may result in sustained quality of life.

Focal signs, including megaesophagus ( Figure  27 -29) and dysphagia without signs of generalized weakness, may also be seen. 117 Abyssinians and the related Somalis are at the highest relative risk for MG, suggesting a genetic basis for this autoimmune disorder. 117 A form of acquired MG in cats has been associated with administration of methimazole, 119 with clinical signs developing 2 to 4 months after beginning treatment for hyperthyroidism. Congenital MG is extremely lacking. Evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage and, in one cat, an avulsed kidney has been reported.

A minimum database should include a complete blood count, chemistry panel (including creatine kinase levels), urinalysis, abdominal ultrasound, and possibly thyroid levels. Advanced neurodiagnostics may be indicated as well, including electrophysiologic testing (e.g., electromyogram [EMG], nerve conduction velocities) and nerve and muscle biopsy.

This assay is both highly sensitive and specific. Intravenous administration of edrophonium chloride may temporarily ameliorate clinical signs, but the response of cats to this drug is less reliable than that in dogs. 26 In addition to acetylcholine receptor antibody levels, the diagnostic workup should include thoracic radiographs, even in the absence of respiratory signs, on account of the high incidence of thymomas diagnosed in myasthenic cats as well as the potential for megaesophagus. In a retrospective report of 105 cases of acquired MG in cats, 27 of 105 (25.7%) were identified with thymoma. The incidence of megaesophagus is typically lower in cats with MG than it is in dogs because of the different distribution of skeletal muscle in the esophagus of the two species, but megaesophagus was still identified in 14.3% of myasthenic cats in the same study. 117 The first line of therapy includes anticholinesterase drugs (pyridostigmine bromide starting at 0.5 mg/kg, administered orally every 12 hours), which help alleviate weakness by prolonging the action of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. Cats may have a greater sensitivity than dogs to the side effects of this drug and may develop ptyalism, tremors, respiratory distress, vomiting, and diarrhea, especially at higher doses. If an optimal response to therapy is not seen or unacceptable side effects are observed, corticosteroids may be indicated but should be used with great caution, particularly in cats with megaesophagus. Immunosuppressive doses are not recommended because of the risk of aspiration pneumonia and the potential for corticosteroids to worsen muscle weakness. 122 Many cats will go into remission spontaneously after months of therapy, and monitoring acetylcholine receptor antibody levels every 3 months is useful in guiding medical management.",

Likewise, diseases of the spine, such as IVDD, should be considered and ruled out as a potential source of lumbar pain. Numerous theories point to a compulsive disorder resulting in self-injurious behavior. 21 Others propose that it is a seizure disorder and best treated with anticonvulsant medication. However, results of EMG and muscle biopsy in five cats with signs of FHS were consistent with an inclusion body myositis/ myopathy, suggesting myalgia as a trigger. 82 There have been no controlled studies comparing the efficacy of various treatments for FHS, and cat owners must be made aware that a significant trial-and-error period may be necessary before the desired clinical response is attained. The most common treatments used for FHS are flea medications, corticosteroids, anticonvulsants, and anti-anxiety drugs (Table 27 -3). The author has not had success with steroids and usually will instead begin treatment with PB (2 mg/kg, administered orally every 12 hours) and increase the dose according to clinical response and drug levels (discussed previously). Alternatively, gabapentin at 10 mg/kg, administered orally every 8 to 12 hours, has both anticonvulsant as well as pain-relieving properties and is considered safe for use in cats. The clinician must be aware that gabapentin pediatric suspension contains xylitol; if a suspension must be used, a xylitol-free product must be obtained from a compounding pharmacy.",

            "text": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine (0.5 to 2 mg/kg administered orally every 24 hours) are occasionally recommended when anticonvulsants do not prove effective. 21 The adverse effects of SSRIs include sedation, anorexia, irritability, vomiting, and has reportedly been associated with neoplasia, trauma, infarctions, and meningoencephalomyelitis. 28, 63 Second-order Horner's syndrome (preganglionic) results from a lesion in the pathway beginning from T1-3, through the associated spinal roots and ramus communicans, and up the cranial thoracic and cervical parts of the sympathetic trunk. This trunk travels with the vagus nerve, forming the vagosympathetic trunk, located in the carotid sheath. 28 Trauma, aggressive jugular venipuncture, bite wounds, mediastinal lymphoma, and brachial plexus avulsion have all reportedly been the cause of second-order Horner's syndrome. 28, 63 Third-order Horner's syndrome is most commonly recognized associated with otitis media (Figure 27-37) and results from lesions rostral to the termination of the preganglionic axons in the cranial cervical ganglion, located at the level of the tympanic bulla. In some cases a cause may not be determined, and in a review of 26 cats with Horner's syndrome, a definitive diagnosis could not be attained in 42.3% of cases. 63 An initial database should include a thorough otic exam as well as three-view thoracic radiographs to evaluate the mediastinum and other associated structures. A complete neurologic examination can help guide the clinician in determining neuroanatomic diagnosis and whether advanced imaging is necessary. Denervation hypersensitivity of the iris to subpharmacologic concentrations of sympathomimetic drugs is a consequence of Horner's syndrome in dogs and cats and can be used to help predict the site of the lesion in affected patients. 63 Instillation of 10% phenylephrine topically will result in mydriasis in less than 20 minutes in cats with third-order Horner's syndrome. In cats with second-order Horner's syndrome, mydriasis will take 20 to 45 minutes to develop, and in those with first-order Horner's syndrome it will take greater than 45 minutes. However, the sensitivity and specificity of this test have not been determined, and the results should be interpreted cautiously, with the history and examination findings being rapid and diffuse spread of the toxin throughout the CNS. 29 However, tetanus may remain focal ( Figure  27 -38), with signs remaining confined to a single extremity where the toxin first entered the CNS. 29 In the generalized form the gait is stiff, there is increased muscle tone, and there may be excessive contraction of the facial muscles, known as the classic risus sardonicus. Prolapse of the third eyelid, wrinkling of the forehead, and trismus (lockjaw) may also be evident. 24, 29 In the most severe form, the patient is recumbent, with opisthotonos and extensor rigidity in all four limbs, and seizures or respiratory arrest may ensue. 24, 29 Diagnosis is largely based on history and the classical physical examination findings, and in some cases a recent wound or surgical procedure may not always be evident. 24 Treatment is largely supportive, although if a wound is present, d\u00e9bridement and antibiotics to kill any remaining C. tetani organisms are indicated. Penicillin G is considered the drug of choice, but amoxicillinclavulanic acid and metronidazole have also been reportedly effective. 137 The benefit of tetanus antitoxin in cats remains uncertain insofar as there is too little information in the literature regarding its safety and efficacy. Supportive care depends on severity of signs, and cats severely affected may require muscle relaxants, physical and diarrhea. In addition, SSRIs inhibit the function of the liver cytochrome P450 enzymes, and care should be taken when prescribing concurrent medications that rely on these enzymes for their metabolism (e.g., PB, carbamazepine, benzodiazepines). Tricyclic antidepressants, such as clomipramine (0.5 to 1 mg/kg, administered orally every 24 hours) 21 can also be used to treat FHS. Adverse effects associated with this drug include sedation, anticholinergic effects, potentiation of arrhythmias in predisposed patients, and lowering of the seizure threshold in patients with seizure disorders. 21 Long-term medical and behavioral management may be necessary, and cats with FHS often require ongoing adjustments in type or dosage of medication (or both).",
