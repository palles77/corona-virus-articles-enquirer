In a 25 cm 2 cell culture flask (5 ml culture medium), the cumulative protein yield of recombinant PoIFN-b reached 2.3 \u00c2 10 6 IU/ml. This cells clone maintained stable expression for at least 20 generations even in the absence of G418 selection pressure. The expressed recombinant PoIFN-b could induce the expression of porcine Mx protein in PK15 cells, and activate the chicken Mx promoter-controlled luciferase reporter gene expression, confirming that the recombinant PoIFN-b has the biological activity of natural porcine type-I interferon. In addition, the recombinant PoIFN-b fully protected PK15 cells against 1000 TCID 50 of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus and pseudo-rabies virus infection, demonstrating its high potential in therapeutic applications. This is the first report of establishing a mammalian cell line with stable expression of porcine IFN-b.",

Currently, one of the research focuses is the mechanism employed by viruses to evade the innate immune defense such as interferons when infecting the host [1] [2] [3] , this in theory provides strong support for effective viral disease prevention and treatment. Viruses such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) [4, 5] , pseudo-rabies virus (PRV) [6, 7] , porcine arteritis virus (PoAV) [8] , swine fever virus [9] [10] [11] and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) [12] , employ the strategy to evade the host immune system by destroying type-I interferon system when infecting the host.",

In addition, pure and stable interferon with high activity per unit mass is needed as the standard for accurate and convenient determination of the interferon biological activity.",

The cell culture supernatants harvested were named PoIFN-b pCA and mock pCA , respectively, and antiviral activity was assayed in MDBK cells using VSV. The result showed that the antiviral activity of PoIFN-b pCA was 9.9 \u00c2 10 5 IU/ ml, while 10-fold diluted mock pCA had no antiviral activity. Together with the sequencing results, it is confirmed that the correct full ORF of PoIFN-b gene was obtained, and subcloned to pCN to generate a stable recombinant expression plasmid pCN-PoIFN-b.",
