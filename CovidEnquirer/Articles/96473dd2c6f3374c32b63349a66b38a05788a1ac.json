            "text": "In China, variants of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) evolve continually and diverse recombinant strains have been reported. Here, an IBV strain, designated as ck/CH/LJX/2017/07 (referred as JX17) was isolated from chicken vaccinated with H120 and 4/91 in Jiangxi, China, in 2017. Sequence analysis reveals of the S1 gene of JX17 the highest nucleotide identity of 98.15% with that of GI-7 genotype TW2575/98 strain. Furthermore, whole genome analysis among JX17 and other 18 IBV strains demonstrates that JX17 has the highest nucleotide identity of 95.94% with GI-19 genotype YX10 strain. Among all genes of JX17 except the S1 gene, the N gene and 3' UTR have the highest identity to GI-13 genotype 4/91 strain and the rest genes are the most identical to GI-19 genotype YX10 strain. Analyzed by the RDP and SimPlot, the recombination of JX17 strain was shown to occur in regions which include 5'-terminal S1 gene (20,344 to 22,447 nt), most N gene and 3' UTR (26,163 to 27,648 nt). The pathogenicity study shows that JX17 is a natural low virulent IBV variant which caused respiratory symptoms but no death. Taken together, these results indicate that IBV strains continue to evolve through genetic recombination and three prevalent genotypes in China including QX, TW and 4/91 have started to recombine.",

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus and the causative agent of a highly contagious respiratory disease of major economic importance to the poultry industry (Cook et al., 2012) . Similar to other coronavirus, the genome of IBV contains 6 genes (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1998) . The spike (S) glycoprotein, encoded by gene 2, is cleaved into S1 and S2 submits by cellular proteases upon viral invasion, with S1 forming the tip of a spike and S2 anchoring to the viral membrane (Cavanagh et al., 1992) . The S1 subunit, with virus neutralizing epitopes, plays an important role in viral attachment to host cells (Cavanagh, 1983) . Both of envelope protein (E) and membrane glycoprotein (M), encoded by gene 3 and gene 4 individually, are membrane-binding proteins. The nucleocapsid protein (N), encoded by gene 6, plays a key role in viral replication and assembly as well as in cellular immunity (Ignjatovic and Galli, 1995) . At the same time, there are other genes that encode for proteins interspersed among structural genes, namely 3a, 3b, 5a, and 5b (Boursnell et al., 1987) .In addition to these conventional protein, non-structural proteins such as 4b, 4c, and 6b, were found to exist in most IBVs and Turkey coronavirus (TCoV) (Gomaa et al., 2008; Reddy et al., 2015; Thor et al., 2011) .",

            "text": "In China, IBV strains have been identified since 1982 and then struck the whole country (Han et al., 2011) . In previous studies, the S1 gene phylogenetic analysis indicated that IBV strains isolated in China could be divided into at least 7 genotypes including QX-type (GI-19), TW-type (GI-7), 4/91-type (GI-13), Mass-type (GI-1), HN08-type (GI-22), TC07-2-type (GVI-1) and LDT3-type (Feng et al., 2017; Li et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2018) . QX genotype strains, first isolated from Qingdao, China in 1996, are dominant epidemic strains in China at present (Xu et al., 2018) . Recently, the prevalence of TW genotype strains, found in Taiwan, China, starts to exacerbate in mainland China (Feng et al., 2017) . IBV strains isolated in Taiwan were divided into TW-I and TW-II genotypes, both of which were grouped into GI-7, with the former isolated frequently in mainland China commonly exhibiting nephrogenic, and the later isolated in Taiwan before 1990s usually presenting with respiratory symptoms (Wang and Huang, 2000; Wang and Tsai, 1996) . Another widely prevalent genotype in China, the 793/ B (4/91) type (GI-13), which first emerged in Europe in 1991 and quickly spread around the world (Cook et al., 1996) , is easy to recombine with other strains in China (Liu et al., 2013; Owing to the continuous appearance of IBV variants with possible shift of the serotype or pathogenicity, IB breaks out frequently even among the vaccinated flocks (Jackwood, 2012) . SAIBK variant, presenting as nephrogenic, was proved to be the recombinant virus of YX10 strain , YN strain (GI-19) and Mass-type strain (GI-1) (Yang and Ma, 2013) . Coincidentally, variants such as ck/CH/LZJ/ 111113, originating from ck/CH/LDL/09/022 (GI-19) and 4/91(GI-13), and ck/CH/LHLJ/140906, which presented as a new serotype, originating from 4/91 (GI-13) and H120 (GI-1), were isolated in China (Liu et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2015) . In recent years, the recombinant strains of QX and 4/91 genotype emerged. One typical strain referred as CK/CH/GD/QY16 was isolated in 2016, and then appeared with high frequency (Feng et al., 2018) . Additionally, the recombinant viruses involving widespread TW type strains, such as the recombinant of QX and TW I genotype, also began to accumulate .",

Briefly, 0.2 ml allantoic fluid diluted to 10 2 -10 9 times was inoculated into each embryo (4 embryos for each dilution). The allantoic fluid from the embryos inoculated with the highest dilution ratio that was positive for IBV was used for the next dilution passage. After three limiting dilution passages, the allantoic fluid positive for IBV was selected for genome sequencing and pathogenicity test.

The results indicate that JX17 is possibly a recombinant strain formed by a major parent strain YX10 and two minor parent strains TW and 4/91. It has been proved that the recombination breakpoints of JX17 are located at the 20,344 to 22,447 and 26,163 to 27,648 nt. The region 1 to 20,343 and 22,448 to 26,162 nt is 97.5% similar to YX10, the region 20,344 to 22,447 nt shows 98.1% similarity with TW2575/98, and the region 26,163 to 27,648 nt shows 99.8% similarity with 4/91. The P-value of RDP method is 2.828 \u00d7 10 \u2212252 and 2.784 \u00d7 10 \u2212151 . To confirm the results of the RDP analysis, genomic sequence analysis of JX17, YX10, TW and 4/91 was carried out using the Simplot software. The Simplot result indicates that there is recombination signal. Recombination diagram is shown by BootScan analysis in SimPlot software (Fig. 3) . The recombination region consists of 5'-terminal S1 protein gene with 2104 nt, partial N protein gene and 3'UTR with 1485 nt. At the same time, the phylogenetic trees of three detected recombinant regions including 1 to 20,459 and 22,637 to 26,395 nt, 20,460 to 22,636 nt and 26,396 to 27,802 nt among the 19 strains were constructed after alignment (Fig. 4) . It demonstrates that there is a topological alternation in the recombinant region of JX17, which further confirms the recombination event.",

IBV variants frequently occurred with diversity, making it more difficult to control this disease (Sjaak et al., 2011) . Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the complete genome of some isolated strains to monitor the recombination event. Genome-wide sequences of recombinant IBV strains obtained by Sanger sequencing were reported in previous studies Jiang et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2016) . In this study, we isolated JX17 strain from yellow feather broilers vaccinated with H120 and 4/91 vaccines and got monocle IBV virus by limiting dilution passages. JX17 was proved to derive from YX10 strain, TW2575/98 strain and 4/91 strain by the recombinant analysis.
