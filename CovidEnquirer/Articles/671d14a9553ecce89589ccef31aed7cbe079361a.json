            "text": "Viral infection induces translocation of the nucleolar protein GLTSCR2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, resulting in attenuation of the type I interferon IFN-b. Addressing the role of GLTSCR2 in viral replication, we detect that knocking down GLTSCR2 by shRNAs results in significant suppression of viral replication in mammalian and chicken cells. Injection of chicken embryo with the GLTSCR2-specific shRNA-1370 simultaneously or 24 h prior to infection with Newcastle disease virus (NDV) substantially reduces viral replication in chicken embryo fibroblasts. Injection of shRNA-1370 into chicken embryo also reduces the replication of avian influenza virus (AIV). In contrast, GLTSCR2-derived protein G4-T, forming ahelical dimers, increases replication of seven various DNA and RNA viruses in cells. Our studies reveal that alteration of the function of cellular GLTSCR2 plays a role in supporting viral replication. GLTSCR2 should be seriously considered as a therapeutic target for developing broad spectrum antiviral agents to effectively control viral infection.",

            "text": "Type I interferon (IFN) cytokines are the first-line of defense against viral infections. They act through the immune system by rapidly inducting cellular modulators, thus inhibiting viral replication and spreading (Burke et al., 2014) . Viral infections yield highly conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Viral RNA contains short hairpin dsRNA with triphosphorylated 5 0 end (5 0 pppRNA) that preferentially activates host's pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including the retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) receptor (Ng and Gommerman, 2013) . Tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins, TRIM25 (Gack et al., 2007) and TRIM4 (Yan et al., 2014) , play a critical role in RIG-I activation through K63-linked ubiquitination. The activated RIG-I further interacts with mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and stimulates transcription factor, IFN regulatory factor-3/7 (IRF-3/7) to induce IFN gene expression (Wilkins and Gale, 2010) . IFNs, secreted from virus-infected cells, bind to the IFN receptor (IFNAR) on the cell surface to initiate the JAK-STAT pathway. This upregulates hundreds of IFN-stimulated gene products (ISGs) and suppresses viral infection (Carty et al., 2014; Schneider et al., 2014) . RIG-I agonists have been shown to induce IFN's expression and multiple innate antiviral response to control a number of viral infections. These include, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) of the family Rhabdoviridae (Goulet et al., 2013) , hepatitis C virus (HCV) of the family Flaviviridae (Goulet et al., 2013) , influenza virus of the family Orthomyxoviridae (Chiang et al., 2015) , and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) of the family Herpesviridae (Liu et al., 2016) . Viral infections, including rhabdovirus (Masatani et al., 2010) , paramyxovirus (Ling et al., 2009 ), orthomyxovirus (Tawaratsumida et al., 2014 , coronavirus (Xing et al., 2013) , and herpesvirus (Xing et al., 2012) , may counteract RIG-I-dependent IFN antiviral response. It has also been reported that viruses utilize the host cell's deubiqutinases and ubiquitin ligases to antagonize RIG-I-mediated innate immune response and succeed in viral replication. Cellular ubiquitin-specific proteases, USP21 (Fan et al., 2014) , USP3 (Cui et al., 2014) and USP15 (Zhang et al., 2015) , a subfamily of deubiqutinase (Reyes-Turcu et al., 2009) , remove K63-linked polyubiquitin chains from RIG-I and block it to induce IFN-b. Moreover, a cellular protein antagonizes the activation of RIG-I and participates in the innate immune response during viral infection. Such as Syndecan-4 (SDC4) and NOD-like receptor family CARD domain containing 5 (NLRC5) protein can interact with RIG-I to negatively regulate type I IFN antiviral response (Cui et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2016) . The level of antiviral cytokines is significantly higher in USP21/SDC4-deficient mice. It should be noted that USP21/SDC4deficient mice are more resistant to viral infection as compared with the control mice (Fan et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2016) . It can thus be inferred that the depression of endogenous negative regulators of type I IFN exhibits a potential antiviral effect.",

            "text": "Glioma tumor suppressor candidate region gene 2 protein (GLTSCR2) is a nucleolar protein that contains multiple nucleolar localization sequences (Kalt et al., 2012) . GLTSCR2 physically interacts with phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), and modulates programmed cell death (Okahara et al., 2004; Yim et al., 2007) . Our previous study showed that viral infection induces translocation of GLTSCR2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic GLTSCR2 blocks IFN-b induction and deactivates RIG-I by negatively regulating it via K63-linked ubiquitination (Wang et al., 2016a) . In present study, we find that purified G4-T, which mimics GLTSCR2 protein, promotes efficient proliferation of DNA and RNA viruses of distinct genera. We also develop a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) plasmid that targets a specific GLTSCR2 gene. Treatment of GLTSCR2-specific shRNA is found to significantly inhibit in vitro and in vivo infections. This paper provides solid evidence that GLTSCR2 is a valuable target for developing cell-based antivirals.",

We also explored the effect of G4-T on the expression of viral mRNA throughout the entire infection course. As shown in Fig. 3B , G4-T significantly enhances the intracellular level of HCV-NS5A mRNA at 8, 12, and 24 h postinfection (h.p.i.) . We also find that the expression levels of HCV-NS5A mRNA present in a similar manner in the presence and absence of G4-T at 12 h.p.i. and 24 h.p.i., respectively. A similar behavior is observed in the presence of G4-T at 24 h.p.i. and in the absence of G4-T at 48 h.p.i. (Fig. 3B) . The results shown in Fig. 3A and B indicate that G4-T promotes efficient replication of HCV in a virus titer in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, Huh7.5.1 cells are transfected with the linear Jc1-Luc HCV plasmid, followed by treatment with G4-T protein; cell lysates are subjected to luciferase assay. The result shows that G4-T improves in vitro transcription of Jc1-Luc HCV (Fig. 3C) . Finally, the HCV genotype 1b repliconcontaining cell line (2\u00c03\u00fe) is seeded in the presence of G4-T.

As shown in Fig. 4AeC , GFP-NDV produces a larger number of syncytiums in cells treated with G4-T at 20 mg/ml as compared to those not treated with G4-T. These results demonstrate that the G4-T protein plays a significant role in promoting the spreading of the virus. In addition, G4-T treatment for 60 h does not induce syncytium formation (Fig. 4D ). Viral replication is further confirmed by examining the expression of NDV-P. As shown in Fig. 4E , G4-T significantly promotes viral replication at 24 and 48 h.p.i., but is ineffective at 60 h.p.i.

Several studies, including the ones conducted by Andrejeva et al., 2002 and Hilton et al., 2006, have shown that viral proteins may counteract IFN antiviral response to facilitate their replication. The permanent cell lines stably expressing these viral proteins have been established for optimal in replication of viruses including paramyxovirus (Young et al., 2003) and herpesviruses (Everett et al., 2008; McSharry et al., 2015) . It is thus inferred that if the accumulation of negative regulators of type I IFN is increased in cells, they are more susceptible to virus infection than the parent control cells. In the present study, we address the key challenges that remain towards developing more efficient virus cultivation, and establish a simple approach that substantially inoculate viruses by directly adding recombinant protein G4-T in a culture medium of mammalian cells. G4-T protein, a negative regulator of type I IFN, can promote efficient proliferation of at least 9 laboratory adapted and clinically isolated viruses, including the families, Rhabdoviridae (VSV), Orthomyxoviridae (AIV), Paramyxoviridae (NDV, CDV), Coronaviridae (PEDV, IBV), Picornaviridae (EV-A71), Flaviviridae (HCV), and Herpesviridae (HSV-1).

The development of the plasmid-based technology to produce shRNA, driven by the U6 promoter, has made long term and inducible gene silencing possible (Sui et al., 2002) . A number of studies have demonstrated that RNAi-mediated gene suppression of pathogenic viruses to be highly effective against many human and animal viruses both in vitro and in vivo (Burnett et al., 2011; DeVincenzo, 2012; Huang, 2008; Jain and Jain, 2015; Spurgers et al., 2008) . The siRNA-and shRNA-mediated knockdown can inhibit viral replication of NDV and AIV in chicken cells and embryos. The plasmid-based shRNA that targets matrix protein M of NDV (Yin et al., 2010) and nucleocapsid protein NP of AIV (Abrahamyan et al., 2009) leads to a yield reduction of 80 and 400 folds in cells, respectively. Furthermore, shRNA targets NP of NDV that is delivered into the chicken embryos and reduces HA value by 10 folds in virus titer (Yue et al., 2009) , while siRNA targets NP of AIV and reduces HAU value by 8 folds (Ge et al., 2003) .",

            "text": "In this study, GLTSCR2-specific shRNA-1370 is evaluated for antiviral activity against NDV and AIV by means of virus titration in chicken cells and embryos. Our results show that plasmid-based shRNA-1370 induces up to 1000-fold decrease in the infective titer in cells infected with NDV (Fig. 5) . In our chicken embryo experiments, NDV of 50 PFU in 50 ml has been selected to inject into the allantoic cavity of 9-day chicken eggs. Infected eggs are stored immediately at 4 C for 12 h, and all eggs are harvested and analyzed simultaneously for consistency. Under this experimental condition, NDV titer reaches the peak at 96 h.p.i. As shown in Figs. 6e8, application of shRNA-1370 substantially reduces viral replication of NDV and AIV in chicken embryo fibroblasts. There are two time milestones that are noteworthy. At 96 h.p.i, the case with a shRNA-1370 treatment simultaneously or 24 h prior to infection with NDV substantially reduces the virus titer in TCID 50 by over 60 folds, and in HAU value by 3 folds for AIV. It is suggested that the shRNA-1370 treatment has substantial effect on viral replication. The impact is stronger with increasing treatment time. At 72 h.p.i, beyond our expectation, a simultaneous shRNA-1370 treatment with NDV infection reduces the virus titer in TCID 50 by 29 folds, and in HAU value by 4 folds for AIV. The antiviral effect at 72 h.p.i. is more prominent than that at 48, 60, and 84 h.p.i. This interesting issue remains to be addressed. There is limited literature describing shRNA plasmid-based platforms that target cellular proteins utilized by viruses for in vivo proliferation. Our study provides a model for the screening and identification of cell-based antivirals. This work also provides a new idea for the design of an intervention strategy against multiple viruses by targeting negative feedback regulators of type I IFN.",
