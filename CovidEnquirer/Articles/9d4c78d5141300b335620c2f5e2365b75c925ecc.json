The S gene sequences of these viral strains were compared with those of recently published strains BCV-Mebus, BCV-Quebec, and BCV-F15. An open reading frame of 4092 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 1363 amino acid residues, was found in all six strains. Frameshifts and insertions or deletions were not observed except for the BCV-F15. The S gene sequences were more than 98% conserved overall inspite of different origins of the six viruses. There were 45 to 56 nt differences between the virulent and avirulent groups while there were 6 to 14 nt differences among four avirulent strains. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences indicated that the S proteins had typical properties of membrane glycoproteins.",

It possesses a single-stranded, nonsegmented RNA genome with positive polarity (3). The virion contains four major structural proteins: the nucleocapsid protein (N), the transmembrane protein (M), the hemagglutinin/ esterase protein (HE) and the spike protein (S) (4). The S glycoprotein is a predominant peplomeric structure forming the typical coronavirus morphology. It is synthesized as a high molecular weight (mol. wt.) precursor (gpl90) which is cleaved to yield two comigrating subunit polypeptides: the N-terminal half (Sl ) and the C-terminal half (S2) with an approximate mol. wt. of 100 kDa (3, 5) . The S glycoprotein functions in virus attachment to permissive cells, virus-induced cell fusion, elicitation of neutralizing antibodies and cell-mediated immunity (6). Two antigenic domains responsible for neutralization of BCV-Quebec and BCV-L9 have been identified on the S protein (Ref. (7); Hussain et a/., submitted). However, the location of the neutralizing epitopes on the BCV S protein has not yet been determined. Comparison of the S proteins with S-spe- ' To whom reprint requests should be addressed cific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) revealed that different neutralizing and non-neutralizing epitopes as well as conformational epitopes were present in the S glycoproteins specified by the virulent and avirulent strains (Hussain et al., submitted) . In order to understand the molecular basis of the observed antigenic diversity of the S glycoproteins we successfully amplified, directly sequenced, and cloned the entire S genes of different BCV strains using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We report here the sequence characteristics of one virulent and two avirulent BCV strains and their comparison with the recently published sequences of three other BCV strains.",

The alignment reveals that the strain BCV-Quebec is closely related to the avirulent strains BCV-Mebus, BCV-L9, and BCV-Vaccine (6 to 14 nt and 4 to 11 aa differences, respectively), suggesting that this strain is a variant of the prototype BCV-Mebus. In contrast to the nucleotide sequences, the amino acid sequences of BCV-LY138 and BCV-F15 were more homologous (13 aa differences). As shown in Fig. 3, 9 amino acids in the avirulent strains were substituted in both BCV-LY138 and BCV-F15: A to V (38), R to T (94),KtoN(121),LtoM(254),HtoD(476),VtoA (749),VtoE(980),AtoV (1106),HtoP(1247),andI to K (1347). This suggests that the wild-type strain BCV-F15 is possibly a virulent strain, and that the 9 amino acids, especially the proline (at 1247) and lysine (at 1347) on the carboxy-terminal, may relate to BCV virulence. Amino acid differences between the virulent and avirulent groups varied from 16 to 26 aa. Apparently, most of these substitutions occurred in the Sl peptide (Fig. 3) .",

            "text": "Comparisons of the amino acid sequences in the antigenic region ( 14, 16) suggested that two proline substitutions may cause the antigenic differences: at amino acid position 507, a proline in the avirulent strain BCV-L9 was substituted by a serine in the virulent strain BCV-LY138, and another proline (at 567) was substituted by a threonine in all other strains. Proline is considered a helix-breaking residue, which may influence significantly the conformation and secondary structure of peptide molecules ( 17) . The proline substitutions resulted in decreased hydrophilicity, surface probability, and antigenicity, but increased flexibility of the peptide in this region (data not shown). Our previous study indicated that one neutralizing epitope of BCV-L9 was present in BCV-Vaccine but absent in the virulent strain BCV-LY 138, and one non-neutralizing epitope was present only in the avirulent strain BCV-L9 (Hussain et a/., submitted). The number of proline substitutions in this region coincides with the number of conformational epitopes absent in BCV-LY 138 and BCV-Vaccine lead us to conclude that substitutions of these prolines to other amino acids may alter the conformation of the S protein, and cause the loss of conformation-dependent epitopes in BCV-LY138 and BVC-Vaccine. This hypothesis is currently under investigation. It is unclear whether substitutions of these prolines and other amino acids in this region also correlate with BCV virulence.",

            "text": "Our previous studies revealed that the biological properties of fusion, plaque formation and host cell range were evidently different between the virulent and avirulent groups of BCV strains (8). The fusion activity of BCV is believed to be associated with the S polypeptide and the cleavage of the S into Sl and S2 subunits (5, 18) . The sequence KRRSRR at the predicted proteo-Iytic cleavage site was conserved in the virulent strain BCV-LY138 and in the avirulent strains while the sequence KRRSVR occurred in the wild-type BCV-F15 (Fig. 3) . The cleavage site of BCV S protein is located in a hydrophilic area, in contrast to paramyxoviruses and myxoviruses, in which the cleavage site is located in hydrophobic domains (20-30 aa) of the fusion proteins ( 19, 20) . These observations imply that there might be a different mechanism involved in BCV-induced cell fusion. Parker et al. (14) indicated that a sequence VLGCLGSAC (905-913) on the S protein of BCV-Quebec may constitute a portion of the fusogenic domain within the BCV S2 subunit. This stretch is similar to the sequence LLGCIGSTC of MHV-A59, which contains a neutralizing epitope (25) . By comparing with paramyxovirus and retrovirus, Chambers et a/. (26) proposed that the hydrophobic region adjacent to heptad repeat sequences may be the potentially fusion-related domain in the S proteins of mouse hepatitis virus, infectious bronchitis virus, and transmissible gastroenteritis virus. After multiple alignments it is found that the heptad repeat sequences are located in the S2 at positions 999-l 038 which are conserved in all strains, and the hydrophobic regions are located at 961-998 (see Fig. 3 ). However, a direct involvement of these sequences in BCV fusion has yet to be demonstrated. Similarly, the El protein of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) does not contain a hydrophobic N-terminal region. It has been proposed, however, that in El an internal uncharged stretch of 17 residues, located about 80 aa from the N-terminal, might act as the putative fusogenic domain (27) . Interestingly, we found three patterns of amino acid substitution in the putative fusogenic domain: at position 971, V in the avirulent strains was substituted by E in the virulent strains; W (898) and A (993) were substituted by I and V in BCV-Mebus and BCV-Quebec, respectively. It is unclear, however, whether these amino acid changes in the predicted cleavage sites and the putative fusogenic domains reflect any functional differences, such as fusion activities among different BCV strains.",
