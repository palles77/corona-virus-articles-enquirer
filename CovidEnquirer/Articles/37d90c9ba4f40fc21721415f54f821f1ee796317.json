For SARS-CoV infection, it has been shown that nucleotides 952-1530 of the spike protein gene of SARS-CoV encoded a 193-amino acid fragment responsible for attaching to the receptor for SARS-CoV, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [9] . Furthermore, we, and also others, have shown that patients with SARS produced antibody response against the spike protein of SARS-CoV [3, 10, 11] , and it has been demonstrated that the spike protein is the major target for passive immunization [12, 13] . In studies that determine the relative importance of humoral and cell mediated immunity for protection against SARS-CoV infection, it was confirmed that neutralizing antibody, when administered by passive immunization, was crucial in conferring protection [14] , whereas T-cell immunity was unable to lead to protection [15] . In addition, for vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV, spike protein-based DNA vaccines appeared to be a promising group of vaccine shown to produce protective immunity against SARS-CoV infections, whereas recombinant spike protein vaccines produced by Escherichia coli were not efficient in terms of generation of protective immunity as compared to those generated from eukaryotic systems such as transfection of cell lines [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . However, multiple doses of intramuscularly (i.m.) administered DNA vaccine or recombinant protein generated from the eukaryotic systems are quite expensive, and therefore may not be practical in developing countries. No data on less expensive modalities of immunization, such as DNA vaccine followed by boosters of recombinant vaccine produced by E. coli or oral mucosal DNA vaccines [26] [27] [28] [29] , are available.",

This portion of the spike protein was used because it contains the receptor-binding domain within the S1 domain that is highly immunogenic, whereas the complete spike protein was not expressible in E. coli. The PCR product was cloned into the BamHI and KpnI sites of vector pQE-31 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The resultant clone was digested by PstI, and the PstI fragment which contained the gene encoding amino acid residues 250-667 of the spike protein was cloned into expression vector pQE-30 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) in frame and downstream of the series of six histidine residues.

After washing with washing buffer five times, 100 l peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM and IgG, rabbit anti-mouse IgG1, IgG2a and IgG3 and rat anti-mouse IgG2b antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., USA) diluted according to manufacturer's instructions using PBS-2% skim milk were added to the corresponding wells accordingly and incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 1 h. IgM and total IgG levels were assayed to assess the primary and secondary immune response, while the IgG subtypes were used to determine whether the humoral response was inclined towards the Th1 (IgG2a and IgG2b) or Th2 (IgG1 and IgG3) pattern. After washing with washing buffer five times, 100 l diluted 3,3 ,5,5 -tetramethylbenzidine (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. One hundred microliters of 0.3 M H 2 SO 4 was added and the absorbance at 450 nm of each well was measured. Each sample was tested in duplicate and the mean absorbance for each serum was calculated. The serum antibody level of a particular mouse was defined as the absorbance obtained from the serum taken 42 days after the last dose of the vaccine minus that of the corresponding mouse taken the day before immunization. The Th1/Th2 index of each mouse is calculated by the following formula: IgG2a \u00d7 IgG2b/IgG1 \u00d7 IgG3.",

Twofold dilutions of mouse sera (from 1:20 to 1:1280) were tested in duplicate against 100 TCID 50 of SARS-CoV. A corresponding set of cell controls with sera but without virus inoculation was used as controls. The cells were scored for the inhibition of the cytopathic effect (CPE) at 48 h. The titer of neutralizing antibody is defined as the maximum dilution of serum at which the percentage of CPE is less than or equal to 50%.",

            "text": "Neutralizing (Table 2 , Groups 4 and 6). This indicates that the type of vaccine used for priming is crucial in determining the type of immune response developed. Subsequent doses will booster the immune response generated by the first dose of vaccine. Of note is that the humoral immune response developed in mice primed with spike polypeptide DNA vaccine and boosted with S-peptide from E. coli was not particularly of the Th1 type as compared to that developed in mice immunized with S-peptide from E. coli alone. This indicates that a Th1 type immune response may not be essential for the generation of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV. Although our results suggest that priming with DNA vaccines and boosting with S-peptide produced by E. coli was successful in the generation of neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV, further experiments using infection models to evaluate its protective immunity are warranted, since anti-spike antibodies have been shown to enhance the infectivity of coronaviruses in some cell culture systems, as occurred with SARS-CoV and feline infectious peritonitis virus [33, 34] . The present observation may have major practical value, such as immunization of civet cats, as production of recombinant proteins from E. coli is far less expensive than production of recombinant proteins using eukaryotic systems such as transfection of cell lines or DNA vaccines. Although it has been shown that DNA vaccines are able to generate both humoral and cellular immunity successfully for various pathogens in mice, one of the major limitations for its clinical use is its ineffectiveness when it is used in humans, unless a large amount of DNA is used for immunization [35, 36] . As for the production of recombinant spike polypeptide generated by eukaryotic systems such as transfection of COS7 and BHK21 cells [24] or using the baculovirus system [25] , although the conformation and/or glycosylation of the spike polypeptide produced can theoretically be more similar to the native viral spike protein, it is not easy to scale up the production of such recombinant proteins to industrial levels. In contrast to recombinant spike polypeptide generated Fig. 3 . SARS-CoV spike polypeptide-specific lymphocyte proliferation index of Balb/c mice immunized with the various vaccines. The 12 groups correspond to the 12 groups of mice described in Table 1 (bar = average of six mice, error bar = 1 standard deviation). Table 1. by eukaryotic systems, a large amount of S-peptide can be produced by E. coli in a relatively inexpensive way, and such S-peptide can be used successfully as boosters. Further studies on the effectiveness of this mode of vaccination for generation of protective immunity against SARS-CoV in other animals could be performed. This principle can also be examined in vaccination for other pathogens, where \"more effective\" modalities of vaccination, such as DNA vaccine, can be used for priming, and the \"less expensive\" recombinant protein produced by E. coli, instead of eukaryotic systems, can be used as boosters.",

            "text": "Spike polypeptide DNA vaccines delivered by the liveattenuated Salmonella system did not induce good neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV infection. We have previously shown that hepatitis B virus DNA vaccine presented by the live-attenuated Salmonella system generated good cytotoxic T lymphocyte response, but minimal antibody response, against hepatitis B virus in a mouse model [26, 27] . Furthermore, we found that this immune response was able to down-regulate transgene expression in hepatitis B virus surface antigen transgenic mice [28] . Subsequently, we reported a comparison of the efficacy of DNA vaccine, DNA vaccine delivered by the live-attenuated Salmonella system and recombinant protein vaccine for generation of protective immune response against Penicillium marneffei, a thermal dimorphic fungus infecting 10% of HIV positive patients in China and Southeast Asia, in a mouse model [29] . Results showed that, similar to hepatitis B virus DNA vaccine presented by the live-attenuated Salmonella system, P. marneffei DNA vaccine delivered by the live-attenuated Salmonella system did not generate good antibody response, whereas intramuscular DNA vaccine generated the best protective immunity against P. marneffei infection, implying that both cellular and humoral immune response are important for protection against P. marneffei infection [29] . In the present study, it was observed that, in line with the results of hepatitis B virus DNA vaccine and P. marneffei DNA vaccine delivered by the live-attenuated Salmonella system, spike polypeptide DNA vaccines delivered by the live-attenuated Salmonella system did not induce good antibody response ( Fig. 2 and Table 2 , Groups 9 and 11). Although the mice developed high antibody levels against the spike protein after boosting with S-peptide (Fig. 2, Groups 10 and 12) , the antibodies were not neutralizing in our cell culture system (Table 2 , Groups 10 and 12). This may be due to the ineffectiveness of the DNA vaccine delivered by the live-attenuated Salmonella system in priming the development of neutralizing antibodies in the correct configuration, while the \"non-neutralizing\" antibodies against the spike protein were only elicited in response to the subsequent recombinant S-peptide.",
