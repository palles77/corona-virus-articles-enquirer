Anthrax threats and scares and the emergence of new infectious diseases such as West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and avian influenza have put an increased focus on the essential functions of the country's public health infrastructure. Nurses make up the largest group of health care professionals who work in state and local public health departments across the nation [2] and provide a wide range of services. The new challenges for public health come at a time when there are fewer resources to support such efforts.",

            "text": "The increased need for public health services comes at a time when the current national public health infrastructure of 3000 local health departments has been weakened by years of financial and administrative neglect. There appears to be a lack of funding or political will to support population-based interventions for promoting health and preventing disease. The public health workforce is challenged to function as first responders (ie, the initial health care professionals who contact victims during a public health emergency) and to help rebuild the basic infrastructure necessary to protect the public's health. This article identifies issues in the role of public health nurses in bioterrorism preparedness. Bioterrorism threatens national security when large, susceptible populations deliberately are exposed to highly virulent organisms that produce widespread illness. The ability of terrorists to disrupt health care services was seen when unsuspecting victims intentionally were exposed to anthrax in the United States in the fall of 2001. Before that time, anthrax had been considered as the exotic wool-sorters disease [3] . Multiple victims were exposed, and several agencies responded. The agencies were unable to delineate their roles and the responsibilities of each partner. There was not a clear understanding of the chain of command, how to communicate specialized knowledge, or communicate through the media to the general public. Public health officials had difficulty identifying the limits of their own knowledge, authority, and responsibility. In the midst of the chaos, public health nurses were asked to conduct communicable disease investigations, perform clinical tasks, administer mass medication clinics, and communicate with the worried well.",

The causes of a disaster are described as nature, equipment malfunction, human error, biological hazards, and disease [4] . The International Nursing Coalition for Mass Casualty Education (INCMCE) was ''organized to facilitate the systematic development of sustainable and scalable educational policies related to mass casualty events'' [5] . INCMCE emphasizes that a mass casualty event exceeds the day-to-day operational ability of the local responders and compels planners to provide for surge capacity [5] .",

Public health nurses are accustomed to handling outbreaks of communicable disease and routinely collaborate with other health care workers in primary care and hospital settings.

It takes time to mobilize distant resources, and how a community responds within those first hours will affect the overall morbidity and mortality associated with the incident [6] . The local coordinator works with law enforcement, emergency management, medical care systems, and public health agencies to ensure a quick and comprehensive response can be provided until state and federal help arrives. Public health agencies need established relationships with other local agencies to effectively plan and respond to an event. Common wisdom suggests that emergency preparedness partners do not want to meet for the first time while an actual bioterrorism event is unfolding. While working together, the agencies create plans, conduct exercises, and practice drills to build the trust and relationships that will be needed in the first hours and over the long term. Local agencies will need to be able to continue to work together post disaster to provide follow-up and remediation after state and federal agencies retreat from a community.",

Nurses are among the most trusted and accessible of all health professionals.
