In France, the lay press and media have relayed information about MERS-CoV.

Thus, it was expected that a large portion of the pilgrims would have been informed via the traditional media. Although only 32% of the pilgrims stated that they know the exact name of MERS-CoV, most of them knew about the geographical area at risk (52%), the contagiousness (51%), the severity (61%) and the respiratory features (55%) of the illness. This discordance could probably be explained by the fact that pilgrims may have heard of the epidemic in Saudi Arabia, although they did not know the name of the virus. Our results are in line with those of a study performed in 2013 among pilgrims departing from the south of France, showing that 65% of them were aware of an ongoing MERS-CoV epidemic in Saudi Arabia. 6 However, the information delivered by the media was insufficient to give pilgrims a high level of knowledge about the routes of transmission (4%), the symptoms (7%) and the preventive behaviours (22%). Furthermore, we noted from our health information delivery that although the preventive behaviours during travel were understood in 60% of cases, the recommended course of action in case of fever (35%) and after return (30%) were less well understood. Similarly, in a study performed among nursing students in Korea, the authors found a high knowledge level on MERS-CoV (84.4%) but low rates of correct answers regarding preventive behaviours (44.5%). 8 The unavailability of vaccines was less well known among the pilgrims in our study (24%) than among Saudi Arabian pilgrims (39%). 7 This study has some limitations. First, this was a singlecentre study, and therefore, the study sample may not be representative of Hajj pilgrims in France. Second, the rate of p u b l i c h e a l t h 1 7 3 ( 2 0 1 9 ) 2 9 e3 2 knowledge improvement observed in our study could be related in part to the level of education. Indeed, educational achievement is a well-known social determinant of health as it is associated with fundamental knowledge and reasoning ability. 9, 10, 11 In our study, a low proportion of pilgrims had a high level of education (32%). Although Hajj pilgrims with a high level of education had significantly higher proportions of correct answers for 3 questions on the first questionnaire, likely linked to better baseline knowledge, they only had more correct answers on one question in the second questionnaire. Furthermore, the rate of correct answers for the recommended course of action in case of fever (48%) and after return (57%) remained low in these pilgrims, despite their level of education. Finally, this low understanding of recommended course of actions in case of fever and after return could be explain by the numbers of behaviors the pilgrims had to integrate in a short and same time for both their self-medical care and their preventive behaviours in order to avoid spreading MERS-CoV. Information targeting the public is the preferred means to implement infection control, and this approach has proven its efficacy in HIV infection, multidrug bacterial resistance and other infectious disease epidemics. 9, 12, 13 In our study, poor knowledge about MERS-CoV was observed among adult Hajj pilgrims attending a travel medicine and international vaccination consultation. Information given during this consultation significantly increased the level of knowledge of the pilgrims, but specific knowledge about preventive behaviours to adopt in case of fever and time delay between return and potential MERS-CoV occurrence remained insufficient (below 50%), suggesting potential difficulties in achieving epidemic control in case of MERS-CoV contamination. Therefore, improved delivery of specific information remains necessary to increase the level of knowledge about targeted aspects of the disease.",
