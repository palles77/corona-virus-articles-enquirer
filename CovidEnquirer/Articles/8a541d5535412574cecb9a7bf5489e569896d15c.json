Two trials were conducted with two separate hatches of turkey poults. Turkeys were experimentally immunosuppressed with cyclosporin A (CsA) or cyclophosphamide (CY) and infected with TCV. Prior to infection, treatment with CsA selectively suppressed T cell activity as revealed by 2\u00b13 fold decreased p , 0:1 lymphocyte proliferation responses to a T cell mitogen, concanavalin A (Con A). Treatment with CY mainly induced B cell de\u00aeciency as indicated by signi\u00aecant reductions p , 0:05 in antibody responses to sheep erythrocytes 7 days after injection. Body weight gain of turkeys treated with CY was signi\u00aecantly lower p , 0:05 than that of untreated turkeys at 9 days post-infection (PI). Turkeys treated with CY had 1\u00b12 fold higher immuno\u00afuorescent antibody assay (IFA) scores for TCV antigens p , 0:05 in the intestine than untreated turkeys at 9 or 14 days PI. These results suggested that humoral immunity against TCV infection may be important in turkeys. q",

Although the detailed mechanisms for such protection are not clear, the protective immunity induced by the corresponding coronavirus during the primary infection is essential. Both serum IgG and fecal IgA antibody responses increased following secondary exposure with BCV. The virus-neutralizing antibody responses in serum were also increased following secondary challenge with BCV [6, 9] . The presence of high numbers of antibody-secreting cells and high lymphocyte proliferation activity was correlated with protection against subsequent challenge of TGEV [7] . Antibody responses to IBV were detected in serum, tracheal washes, and tears of chicken infected with IBV. Vaccination studies on IBV generally correlated neutralizing serum antibody responses to protection [10] .",

However, the nature of such resistance is not completely understood. Serum from recovered turkeys could neutralize the infectivity of TCV-containing intestinal contents [11, 12] . Serum antibodies to TCV were detectable by immuno\u00afuorescent antibody assays (IFA) from 9 to 160 days post-infection (PI) [13] . Antibodies to TCV in the intestine and bile were detectable by immunodiffusion test [14] or a sandwich IFA [15] up to 6 months PI. The lymphocyte proliferation responses to mitogen was reported to be enhanced in turkeys infected with TCV [16] . In addition, sequential kinetic studies of humoral and cellular immune responses of turkey poults infected with TCV isolated in our laboratory have shown that activation of speci\u00aec immune responses (humoral and cellular) are associated with the decrease of TCV antigens in turkey intestines (unpublished data). However, which immunity, humoral or cellular, provides the necessary protective immunity for turkey poults against infection with TCV is not clear. Such information is critical in developing strategies for the diagnosis, control, and prevention of turkey coronaviral infection in turkey\u00afocks.",

The ability of chicken lymphocytes to respond to Con A was under genetic control [22] . Lymphocytes from chickens with genetic difference had different proliferative response to Con A. In addition, the genetic selection of turkeys for increased body weight or egg production affected the mitogenic responses of turkey lymphocytes to Con A [23, 24] . The turkeys in the present study were obtained from commercial turkey\u00afocks originate from outbred breeder stocks and had diverse genetic backgrounds. Similar Table 3 Effect of CsA and CY on body weight gain of turkey poults experimentally infected with TCV mechanism(s) of genetic control as demonstrated for chicken lymphocytes may also contribute to the observed individual variation of lymphocyte proliferation responses of these turkeys. In comparison, cellular immunity against avian IBV has been demonstrated by antigen-speci\u00aec proliferation of T lymphocytes, delayed-type hypersensitivity, and increased populations of CD4 or CD8 T cells [10] . Experimental suppression of chicken T cells with CsA enhanced virus titers in the kidney. Spleen mononuclear cells of chicken vaccinated with live IBV showed antigen-speci\u00aec lymphocyte proliferation and produced IL-2 and interferon-g in response to in vitro stimulation with homologous or heterologous strains of IBV [25] . Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses to IBV was demonstrated to be correlated with initial decrease of amount of virus in kidney and lung and clinical respiratory signs of illness [26] . Adoptive transfer of CD8 T lymphocytes from chicks infected with IBV, protected chicks from challenge infection [27] . The functional CTL epitopes were probably present in spike or nucleocapsid structural proteins of IBV [28, 29] .",

The undetectable antibody response of turkey poults treated with CY to SRBC in trial 2 is not caused by any reagent or operation problem because all samples from different groups were treated and examined in the same way simultaneously. This also does not necessarily re\u00afect a complete elimination of humoral B cell activity. The antibody response to SRBC may not be detectable by the evaluation method, hemagglutination assay. Nevertheless, treatment of CY in the present study did signi\u00aecantly suppress the humoral B cell activity and, subsequently, signi\u00aecantly enhanced the severity of TCV infection in turkey poults as revealed by markedly decreased body weight gain and higher scores on IFA staining for TCV antigens in the intestine. Humoral antibody responses to avian IBV in chicken are measurable by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, hemagglutination-inhibition test, or virus neutralization test. Vaccination studies of IBV generally correlated humoral antibody responses with protection. The protective role of B cells against IBV infections has been shown by selective experimental suppression with the chemical CY, the hormone testosterone propionate, or surgical bursectomy [10] . Chickens treated with CY had longer persistence of IBV and, subsequently, showed increased clinical signs and more severe histopathological lesions in the kidney. High titers of humoral antibodies were correlated with the absence of virus recovery from kidney and genital tract and seemed to protect the tracheal epithelium from challenge infection. Spike protein of IBV was considered the major structural protein that induces protective humoral antibody responses. Antibodies generated in mice using a recombinant spike protein as inoculum could neutralize IBV infectivity in ciliostasis tests with tracheal organ cultures [30] . Immunization of a recombinant fragment (S1) of spike glycoprotein protected chickens from challenge infection of IBV [31] .",

Ultrastructural changes included granularity of epithelial cells, loss of microvilli, margination of chromatin in the nucleus, and increased cellularity of the lamina propria [32, 33] . The alteration in the intestinal tract causes failure of absorption and accumulation of\u00afuids and gases resulting in diarrhea and decreased body weight gain. The body weight gain of turkey poults treated with CsA or CY or without treatment of CsA or CY were all signi\u00aecantly decreased after infection with TCV as compared with that of non-infected controls. Treatment of CY increased the severity of TCV infection in turkey poults because the body weight gain of turkeys treated with CY was signi\u00aecantly lower than that of turkeys not treated with CsA or CY after infection with TCV.",
