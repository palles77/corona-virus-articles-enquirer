            "text": "Hartnup amino acid transporter B 0 AT1 (SLC6A19) is the major luminal sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter of small intestine and kidney proximal tubule. The expression of B 0 AT1 in kidney was recently shown to depend on its association with collectrin (Tmem27), a protein homologous to the membrane-anchoring domain of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2. Methods: Because collectrin is almost absent from small intestine, we tested the hypothesis that it is ACE2 that interacts with B 0 AT1 in enterocytes. Furthermore, because B 0 AT1 expression depends on an associated protein, we tested the hypothesis that Hartnup-causing B 0 AT1 mutations differentially impact on B 0 AT1 interaction with intestinal and kidney accessory proteins. Results: Immunofluorescence, coimmunoprecipitation, and functional experiments using wild-type and ace2-null mice showed that expression of B 0 AT1 in small intestine critically depends on ACE2. Coexpressing new and previously identified Hartnup disorder-causing missense mutations of B 0 AT1 with either collectrin or ACE2 in Xenopus laevis oocytes showed that the high-frequency D173N and the newly identified P265L mutant B 0 AT1 transporters can still be activated by ACE2 but not collectrin coexpression. In contrast, the human A69T and R240Q B 0 AT1 mutants cannot be activated by either of the associated proteins, although they function as wild-type B 0 AT1 when expressed alone. Conclusions: We thus show that ACE2 is necessary for the expression of the Hartnup transporter in intestine and suggest that the differential functional association of mutant B 0 AT1 transporters with ACE2 and collectrin in intestine and kidney, respectively, participates in the phenotypic heterogeneity of human Hartnup disorder.",

Various other clinical symptoms such as pellagra-like rash, cerebellar ataxia, or other neurologic dysfunctions may be present in affected individuals, while other subjects remain, besides experiencing aminoaciduria, asymptomatic. Phenotypic variability might be partially explained by the differential impact of various mutations and the frequent compound heterozygosity.",

ACE2 is involved in heart and kidney pathologies 5 and has been identified as the severe acute respiratory syndrome receptor in vitro 6 and in vivo. 7 Importantly, previous studies have reported ACE2 expression and severe acute respiratory syndrome/coronavirus replication in human small intestine. 8, 9 We first investigated whether ACE2 associates with B 0 AT1 in mouse small intestine. Immunofluorescence, coimmunoprecipitation, and functional data presented here clearly show that ACE2 is the specific partner of B 0 AT1 in the small intestine and thus that the accessory protein of B 0 AT1 is tissue specific.",

The total (in the presence of Na \u03e9 ) but not the sodium-independent transport was dramatically reduced when compared with the wild-type littermates. The equivalent effect was previously shown in kidney brush border membrane vesicles of collectrin \u03ea/\u03ea mice, where the transport was also reduced. 3 These data show that ACE2 is essential (A) Immunofluorescence analysis shows that B 0 AT1 protein expression is lost in small intestine of ace2-null mice. Small intestine sections from ace2 \u03e9/y and ace2 \u03ea/y were colabeled with antibodies against ACE2 (green) and B 0 AT1 (red) and additionally viewed by phase contrast (PC). (B) Western blot analysis shows that B 0 AT1 is absent in small intestine but present in kidney brush border membranes of ace2null mice, whereas B 0 AT1 is expressed in small intestine and absent from kidney brush border membranes in collectrin-null mice. The loading of brush border membranes (2.5-20 g) was tested using a \u2424-actin antibody (\u2424A).

Expressed alone in oocytes, human B 0 AT1 induced a low amino acid transport rate as shown by us and others previously. 1, 2 We show here that its coexpression with mouse or human ACE2 or human collectrin increases the transport function \u03f310-fold (Supplementary Figure 1A ; see supplemental material online at www. gastrojournal.org). The mouse orthologue of collectrin did not activate human B 0 AT1, although it has been shown to be effective on mouse B 0 AT1. 3 We have as yet no explanation for this differential impact of the collectrin orthologues in the X laevis expression system. Different from collectrin, ACE2 has one catalytic site. It is a carboxypeptidase and converts angiotensin I and II to angiotensin 1-9 and 1-7, respectively, 20,21 functionally antagonizing its homologue ACE. We analyzed the role of the catalytic activity of ACE2 in the functional interaction with B 0 AT1 (Supplementary Figure 1B ; see supplemental material online at www.gastrojournal.org). The catalytically dead mutant (ACE2 R273Q) 14 was as efficient as the wild type in enhancing B 0 AT1 function, suggesting that it is not necessary for the interaction. This was expected because human collectrin shares 48% identity with ACE2 at the level of its carboxyl-terminal membrane anchor region but entirely lacks the extracellular peptidase domain. 22 The amino acid selectivity, ion dependence, and kinetic characteristics of human B 0 AT1 coexpressed with ACE2 are, besides a much higher maximal transport rate, very similar to those previously reported for human B 0 AT1 expressed alone 1 ",

Besides 5 previously described missense mutations and one nonsynonymous SNP, we characterized 4 new missense mutations identified in patients with neutral aminoaciduria characteristic of Hartnup disorder belonging to 4 different families (Table 1 The nonsynonymous SNP V252I essentially behaved as wild-type B 0 AT1 when coexpressed with collectrin and ACE2 (Figure 2A, upper and middle panels) . Interestingly, the observed 2-fold to 3-fold increase in B 0 AT1 surface expression measured by surface biotinylation only partially explains the almost 10-fold increase in surface transport function induced by coexpression with collec- The relatively low transport activity of B 0 AT1 D173N and P265L mutants expressed alone is increased by coexpression with ACE2 but not with collectrin. The surface expression of the D173N mutant is also significantly increased by coexpression with ACE2. (C) The wild-type-like function of the A69T or R240Q mutants expressed alone is not increased in the presence of collectrin or ACE2, although in the case of A69T its surface expression is increased. The upper panels of A-C show the transport function measured as radiolabeled L-isoleucine (L-Ile) uptake (means \u03ee SEM of 13-31 oocytes from 3 independent experiments), and the middle panel shows the transport function as current measured by TEVC (9 -11 oocytes from 3 batches). *P \u03fd .05, ***P \u03fd .001. The lower panels show the surface expression assayed by Western blot using surface-biotinylated proteins and a representative Western blot. The data correspond to the means \u03ee SEM (n \u03ed 3-5 independent experiments) of the results normalized to the value obtained for B 0 AT1 expressed alone. For the transport experiments, the significance was evaluated using analysis of variance with Tukey posttest and for the surface biotinylation the comparison of means was performed by unpaired t test. (D) B 0 AT1 and the mutants D173N, P265L, R240Q, and A69T interact with ACE2 in X laevis oocytes.

Surprisingly, collectrin and ACE2 coexpression differentially impacted on the surface expression and function of the 2 B 0 AT1 mutants D173N and P265L ( Figure 2B ). In both cases, coexpression with ACE2 increased the transport rate whereas coexpression with collectrin either had the opposite effect or no effect ( Figure 2B, upper panel) . The transport function of these mutants was shown to be Na \u03e9 dependent as for wild-type B 0 AT1 (Figure 3, upper and middle panels) . Surface biotinylation experiments suggested that the differential function of these B 0 AT1 mutants with the 2 associated proteins is due, in the case of D173N, to a difference in surface expression, whereas the surface expression appeared in the case of P265L to be similar to both associated proteins ( Figure 2B , lower panel, and representative Western blot). Finally, the mutants D173N and P265L coprecipitated with human ACE2, confirming that they interact with ACE2 ( Figure 2D) .",

In the case of R240Q, its surface expression is not increased upon coexpression with ACE2 or collectrin, but coimmunoprecipitation demonstrates that its interaction with ACE2 is not abolished. Assuming a qualitative effect of the R240Q mutation on this interaction, our observation is nonetheless potentially compatible with the hypothesis recently put forward by the group of Broer, namely that the localization of this mutation at the surface of B 0 AT1 might impact on the interaction with accessory proteins. 23 Further studies are necessary to clarify the mechanism by which this mutation, initially classified as an SNP, prevents the normal activation of B 0 AT1 by the accessory proteins. In contrast, in the case of the other functional mutant of this class A69T, an increase in cell surface expression of this mutant B 0 AT1 was demonstrated upon interaction with the associated proteins ( Figure 2C and D) . One possible explanation of why the increase in surface expression did not lead to an increase in transport rate is that ACE2/A69T-B 0 AT1 heterodimers reaching the cell surface remain inactive, meaning that the associated protein inhibits the function of A69T-B 0 AT1. The fact that the residue mutated in A69T is part of a highly conserved motif (NGGGAF) shown to undergo conformational changes during the transport cycle is compatible with this hypothesis. 24 Additionally, that the coexpression of ACE2 or collectrin apparently activates the transport rate of wild-type B 0 AT1 several-fold more than it increases its surface expression (\u03f310-fold vs \u03f32.5-fold) also suggests that associated proteins may impact on transporter function, although normally by increasing the cycling rate. The ion dependency of D173N, P265L, A69T, and R240Q coexpressed with ACE2 or collectrin is not altered; transport is Na \u03e9 but not Cl \u03ea dependent. Wildtype human B 0 AT1 (WT) and the mutants D173N, P265L, A69T, and R240Q were expressed alone or with human collectrin or mouse ACE2. The ion dependence was tested by substituting Na \u03e9 with N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG) and substituting Cl \u03ea with gluconate. Function was assayed by influx of radiolabeled L-isoleucine (L-Ile). For each mutation, 3 independent experiments (15-24 oocytes) were pooled.

Interestingly, the D173N allele is relatively frequent in unrelated Hartnup pedigrees and can also be observed in healthy white patients with a high heterozygote frequency (1:122 healthy individuals). 2, 25 We know of no potential selective advantage for heterozygous carriers that explains the persistence and geographic spread of this mutant allele. 26, 27 The selective functional interaction of D173N with the intestinal accessory protein ACE2 might prevent deleterious effects due to a lack of amino acid absorption and thereby allowing the \"survival\" of this frequent allele.",

            "text": "Although as yet no evidence of genotype-phenotype relationship performed in patients were reported, studies performed long before the identification of the Hartnup transporter have shown that intestinal amino acid absorption differs between subjects with Hartnup disorder. 28, 29 Taken together, our data show that the expression and function of the main epithelial amino acid transporter are modulated by tissue-specific accessory proteins. Moreover, the intriguing fact that these accessory proteins can interact differentially with Hartnup mutations and thereby differentially affect kidney and intestinal amino acid transport function suggests that collectrin and ACE2 may also contribute significantly . The B 0 AT1 mutants R57C, G93R, L242P, E501K, and P579L exhibit no transport activity when expressed alone or coexpressed with collectrin or ACE2. Function was assayed by influx of radiolabeled L-isoleucine (L-Ile) (upper panels) or TEVC (middle panels). For each mutant, 3 independent experiments (13-31 oocytes for influx and 9 -11 for TEVC) were pooled. Comparison of means was performed by analysis of variance with Tukey as posttest. Data represent means \u03ee SEM. ns, not significant. Cell surface expression of labeled proteins (lower panels) was analyzed by Western blot. The bands were quantified and data normalized to the values obtained from oocytes expressing B 0 AT1 proteins alone. For each mutation, 3 to 4 independent experiments were pooled. Comparison of means was performed by unpaired t test. Data represent means \u03ee SEM. *P \u03fd .05. ns, not significant.",

Figure 1 . Function of human B 0 AT1 coexpressed with orthologues of collectrin and ACE2 in X laevis oocytes. (A) Coexpression of ACE2 or human collectrin increases B 0 AT1 function in X laevis oocytes. Tracer flux experiments (upper graph, n \u03ed 16 -32) and TEVC (lower graph, n \u03ed 11) show that human B 0 AT1 (hB 0 AT1) coexpressed with human ACE2 (hACE2), mouse ACE2 (mACE2), or human collectrin (hColl) transports L-isoleucine more efficiently than when expressed alone or in combination with mouse collectrin (mColl). Data points represent means \u03ee SEM. ***P \u03fd .001. ns, not significant. (B) Human B 0 AT1 function is increased by coexpressed human ACE2 independent of its protease activity. The protease-dead human ACE2 mutant (ACE2 R273Q) stimulated the human B 0 AT1-mediated L-isoleucine influx to the same extent as wild-type human ACE2. Data points represent means \u03ee SEM (n \u03ed 15-16). ns, not significant. Figure 2 . Functional characterization of the complex formed by human B 0 AT1 and ACE2 in X laevis oocytes. (A) The amino acid transport by human B 0 AT1 coexpressed with mouse ACE2 in X laevis oocytes is Na \u03e9 but not Cl \u03ea dependent. The ion dependence was tested by substituting Na \u03e9 by N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG) or Li \u03e9 and Cl \u03ea by gluconate in the superfusion solution used for TEVC. The values were normalized to the current obtained by superfusion of the oocytes with 10 mmol/L L-isoleucine in solution containing Na \u03e9 and Cl \u03ea (I norm ). Comparison of means was performed by analysis of variance with Tukey as posttest. Each data point represents the mean \u03ee SEM (n \u03ed 16). ***P \u03fd .001. (B) Amino acid transport by human B 0 AT1 coexpressed with mouse ACE2 in X laevis oocytes is maximal at neutral pH. The pH dependence of the transport was measured by TEVC in oocytes clamped at -50 mV and superfused with Na \u03e9 solution buffered at pH 5.5, 6.5, 7.4, or 8.0. Values were normalized to the current obtained by superfusion of oocytes with 10 mmol/L L-isoleucine in solution pH 7.4 (I norm ). Comparison of means was performed by analysis of variance with Tukey as posttest. Each data point represents the mean \u03ee SEM (n \u03ed 9). *P \u03fd .05, **P \u03fd .01. (C-E) Human B 0 AT1 coexpressed with ACE2 transports a broad range of neutral amino acids with low affinity. (C) The substrate selectivity of human B 0 AT1 coexpressed with mouse ACE2 was measured by TEVC in oocytes clamped at -50 mV and superfused with Na \u03e9 solution containing 1 mmol/L (white bars) or 10 mmol/L (black bars) of amino acids. The currents induced by the amino acids were normalized to the currents obtained in oocytes perfused with 10 mmol/L L-isoleucine (I norm ). Data are shown as mean values \u03ee SEM (n \u03ed 8 -11) and the amino acids are indicated in single letter code. (D and E) The K 0.5 and V max for L-isoleucine and Na \u03e9 of human B 0 AT1 coexpressed with mouse ACE2 was estimated using TEVC. For the Na \u03e9 concentration dependence experiments, the cells were first equilibrated with the indicated Na \u03e9 concentration (0, 1, 5, 10, 30, 50, 70, and 100 mmol/L) before the perfusate containing L-isoleucine ( This patient was the first child of unrelated parents and was diagnosed at 1 year of age after a suspected seizure prompted a metabolic screening of urine. Plasma amino acids and electroencephalography were normal. The patient subsequently had normal growth and development without epilepsy, ataxia, or pellagra. (C) The other Danish patient was a compound heterozygous for P579L and the original Hartnup mutation IVS8\u03e92T\u00a1G. This patient was the second child of unrelated parents and was diagnosed at 2 years of age after onset of partial complex epilepsy with great difficulty to control seizures. The patient had normal plasma amino acids and never had ataxia or pellagra. (D) Another patient from a German family was diagnosed as homozygous for the new missense mutation G93R. This patient was diagnosed at 6 years of age during a migraine workup and also never had ataxia or pellagra. The affected subjects are depicted as filled symbols.",
