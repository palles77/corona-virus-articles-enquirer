Using IBV Arkansas-type (Ark) S protein histochemistry, we show that extension of S1 with the S2 ectodomain improves binding to chicken tissues. Although the S1 subunit is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies, vaccination with S1 protein has been shown to confer inadequate protection against challenge. The demonstrated contribution of S2 ectodomain to binding to chicken tissues suggests that vaccination with the ectodomain might improve protection compared to vaccination with S1 alone. Therefore, we immunized chickens with recombinant trimeric soluble IBV Ark-type S1 or S-ectodomain protein produced from codon-optimized constructs in mammalian cells. Chickens were primed at 12 days of age with water-in-oil emulsified S1 or S-ectodomain proteins, and then boosted 21 days later. Challenge was performed with virulent Ark IBV 21 days after boost. Chickens immunized with recombinant S-ectodomain protein showed statistically significantly (P < 0.05) reduced viral loads 5 days post-challenge in both tears and tracheas compared to chickens immunized with recombinant S1 protein.",

Continuous emergence of new virus serotypes results from mutation and recombination followed by selection [1] . Routinely used live-attenuated IBV vaccines, which are affected by the same evolutionary processes, not only result in vaccine-like viruses with increased virulence and persistence [2, 3] , but may also contribute genetic material for recombination with other vaccine or wild virus populations. We previously identified five minor vaccine virus subpopulations selected in chickens from Arkansas-Delmarva Poultry Industry (ArkDPI)-derived IBV vaccines, designated components (C) 1-5 [3, 4] . The selection of these viral subpopulations within 3 days post-vaccination suggests they replicate better in chickens than the predominant virus population in the vaccine prior to inoculation [3, 4] .",

However, a role for the S2 ectodomain in binding to cells has been demonstrated for spike proteins of Massachusetts serotype IBVs, i.e. the highly-attenuated Beaudette strain and the virulent M41 strain [22, 23] . In the current study, we evaluated binding of trimeric Ark S-ectodomain compared to trimeric S1 subunit alone to multiple relevant chicken tissues. After confirming improved binding of Ark S-ectodomain, which might be explained by the presence of the S2 ectodomain altering the conformation of S1 and thus increasing its affinity for receptors, or by S2 directly contributing to interaction with receptors or co-receptors, we tested the hypothesis that immunization with recombinant soluble trimeric S-ectodomain provides more effective protection than immunization with trimeric S1 subunit alone.",

            "text": "The amino acid sequence of S proteins representing an IBV ArkDPI vaccine subpopulation previously designated C2 (GenBank accession ABY66333) was chosen to produce recombinant proteins. C2 was strongly selected in chickens after vaccination with an ArkDPI-derived attenuated vaccine [3, 4] . Its S1 is almost identical to that of the unattenuated parent ArkDPI isolate [24] and represents the consensus sequence of vaccine subpopulations rapidly positively selected in chickens after vaccination with ArkDPIderived attenuated vaccines [2] [3] [4] 25, 26] . To generate recombinant S1 protein, a human codon-optimized sequence encoding C2 S1 [amino acids (AA) 19-538] was synthesized (GeneArt, Regensburg, Germany) and cloned into the pCD5 vector. To generate recombinant S-ectodomain, a human-codon optimized sequence encoding the C2 S2 ectodomain (S AA 544-1097) was cloned into the pCD5 vector already containing the S1 domain as described [22] . At the S1/S2 border, the furin cleavage site sequence RRSRR was replaced by GGGVP to avoid cleavage of the full length S-ectodomain [22] . These S1 and S-ectodomain-coding sequences were flanked by sequences encoding an N-terminal CD5 signal sequence and sequences encoding C-terminal artificial GCN4 trimerization motif and Strep-tag II for purification and detection of proteins, as described [16] .",

Thus the molar concentration of Sectodomain was one-fourth that of S1. Thus, the increased binding affinity of S-ectodomain compared to S1 is even greater than it appears. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) Beaudette strain is unable to bind to chorioallantoic membrane, the Beaudette S-ectodomain binds efficiently [22] . Furthermore, the extension of the M41 S1 with the M41 S2 ectodomain domain increased binding to chicken trachea [23] . The M41 S1 shows only 77% amino acid sequence identity with the ArkDPI S1 used herein. Thus, the current results confirm these findings for another IBV serotype and additional tissues. Using chimeric S-ectodomain proteins, Promunktod et al. concluded that S2 does not contain an additional independent receptor binding site that would explain its contribution to the affinity of S for receptors [22] . Another possible explanation for improved tissue binding of S-ectodomain is that the S2 subunit is necessary for the S1 protein to adopt a conformation optimal for binding. Structures of trimeric S-ectodomains of other coronaviruses determined by cryoelectron microscopy, e.g. [32, 33] , suggest that the trimeric structure is important for the conformation of S1, because the S1 domains of the monomers are interwoven in the trimer. In the recombinant S1 protein used in this study, the artificial trimerization domain immediately follows the S1 domain and could thus artificially constrain the trimeric S1 in a suboptimal conformation. When the S2 ectodomain is included between S1 and the trimerization domain, the trimers might be closer to their normal conformation. However, our unpublished results indicate that a single amino acid change in the S2 domain can reduce the binding of the S-ectodomain (S. Farjana et al., unpublished results). Thus, S2 may influence the conformation of S1 in a more specific way.",

Thus, if the S2 ectodomain allows S1 to adopt a conformation optimal for attachment, antibodies generated against this conformation might more effectively neutralize virus than antibodies generated against the suboptimal conformation of S1 adopted in the absence of S2. Therefore, we considered the possibility that extension of recombinant S1 protein with the S2 ectodomain would improve the protection afforded by a subunit vaccine. Indeed, our protection trial results indicated that immunization with trimeric S-ectodomain protein significantly reduces viral loads in tears and trachea, as well as tracheal damage, compared to immunization with trimeric S1 protein. Moreover, there were no significant differences in tracheal damage between chickens immunized with S-ectodomain protein and unvaccinated/unchallenged control chickens, indicating complete protection. Conversely, no significant differences were observed between chickens immunized with S1 protein and the mockimmunized group except for the viral load in tears. This limited protection conferred by S1 protein is in agreement with results of others [14] who found that at least four immunizations with Kidney Cecal tonsil Cloaca Fig. 1 (continued) the purified S1 glycoprotein of nephropathogenic N1/62 strain of IBV were necessary to induce protection, even though they used a considerably larger amount of purified S1 antigen (50 mg) for immunization.",

Alternatively, the conserved immunodominant linear neutralizing epitope within S2 [13] might also contribute to improved protection. Although we did not attempt to demonstrate neutralizing antibodies, our ELISA results using both purified IBV and S-ectodomain protein showed a significant increase of antibody level in chickens immunized with S-ectodomain protein compared to those immunized with S1 protein alone, indicating that antibodies to S2 epitopes were generated. Furthermore, a peptide near the amino terminal end of S2 has been shown to induce a protective cell-mediated response [37] . The adjuvant used has been reported to stimulate both antibody and cell-mediated immune responses [38] [39] [40] .
