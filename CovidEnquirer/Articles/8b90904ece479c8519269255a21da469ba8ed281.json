SARS was the first new severe disease transmissible from person-to-person to emerge in the 21st Century. During the global outbreak, a total of 8096 probable cases of SARS and 774 deaths were reported from 29 countries and areas. 1 China (mainland), Taiwan and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) experienced substantial outbreaks, although considerable numbers of cases were also reported from Canada, Singapore and Viet Nam. 1 The United Kingdom (UK) was assessed to be at low risk from SARS throughout the outbreak. 2 Between March and July 2003, 368 reports of suspected SARS cases were made to the Health Protection Agency (HPA). 2 Of these, only nine were initially classified as probable SARS cases, and only one patient, a 23-year-old male, was positive for SARS coronavirus (Co-V) on PCR testing and later showed evidence of seroconversion. Nonetheless, the volume of work within the UK in response to SARS was far greater than suggested by the number of potential SARS cases reported to the HPA. In this paper, we summarise key elements to the UK public health response and lessons learnt from SARS.",

            "text": "Given the unprecedented speed of electronic communication, continuous international liaison through secured web-sites, email and teleconferencing was essential to ensure that international and national public health agencies disseminated accurate and consistent information throughout the outbreaks. The global response to SARS provided new opportunities for the UK to collaborate with WHO (Geneva and Western Pacific Region), a number of public health organisations in south east Asia, as well as national public health centres such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA and Health Canada. The HPA has subsequently worked with colleagues in Hong Kong to establish a Centre for Health Protection (CHP) in light of recommendations of the Hong Kong SARS Expert Committee Report. 3 There was also collaboration with the European Commission (EC), however, this was constrained by the lack of central capacity and experience in the Commission. It is intended that the new European Centre for Communicable Diseases will address this. 4 Despite good levels of international collaboration, some aspects, such as global case reporting to WHO were problematic. Some countries did not contribute to the global dataset that was established to inform and refine evidence-based control measures, and there has been no systematic review of super-spreading events that occurred during the outbreak. The revision of the International Health Regulations (IHR) proposed by WHO in January 2004 provides a mechanism for strengthening early and coordinated responses to outbreaks of international public health concern. 5 Staff throughout the HPA and the UK Devolved Administrations undertook secondments abroad with WHO Geneva and WHO Western Pacific Region, which provided useful contact points for information and discussion. The HPA Enteric, Respiratory and Neurological Virus Laboratory (ERNVL), contributed staff to the multi-national team that identified the causative agent of SARS as a coronavirus, SARS-CoV, within 1 month of the WHO Global Alert being issued. The ERNVL has had subsequent involvement in the development of diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV. The HPA also contributed to the international surveillance response through the development of guidelines, research priorities and modelling activities.",

Patients were classified according to HPA case definitions by CFI staff and the reporting clinician. Surveillance arrangements were revised during the outbreak to encourage initial alerting to HPA Regional Offices and ensure that local public health authorities were aware of the potential cases. Whilst central reporting allowed for prompt reporting and consistent classification of potential SARS cases, this mechanism of reporting would have been unsustainable in the event of a substantial UK outbreak when more responsibility would be devolved to regional staff, and CFI would concentrate on producing aggregate summaries.",

Follow-up of clinical status was requested on all suspect and probable cases at 48 h, 10 days and weekly until recovery.

These systems, while appropriate for the low case load experienced, would have been limited in the event of an outbreak within the UK. Most importantly, the data were entered centrally and the system did not have the capacity for local staff to record and manage case reports or their contacts. Experience from Toronto suggests that for each case of SARS, health authorities should expect to quarantine up to 100 contacts, and to investigate eight possible cases. 10 Data systems must have the capacity to report and track both cases and contacts.",

Management of the response process was challenging in ensuring that staffing was adequate and that all team members were kept up to date with current information. Regular team meetings at the beginning and end of each day were used to brief key staff and allocate tasks. Day-to-day operational response to the evolving outbreak involved epidemiologists who undertook strategic planning and response tasks in addition to their normal responsibilities; administrative support was largely provided on an ad hoc basis, which resulted in some lack of continuity. Particular areas of shortfall during the outbreak period included continuity of staff, especially experienced medical and non-medical epidemiologists, and lack of a centralised operations centre to facilitate sharing of epidemiological and virological information during the investigation of potential cases.

            "text": "The emergence of SARS illustrated the need to strike a balance between mounting a multi-agency outbreak response and ensuring NHS and partner organisations maintain continuity of key services. Similarities noted with the planning requirements for an Influenza pandemic and those of a phased escalation of response to SARS were recognised, developed and exercised. 13 This set out specified actions at local, regional and national levels for the HPA at each level of escalation dependant upon the extent of disease transmission abroad and in the UK. The HPA SARS Contingency Plan also complemented activities specified by the Department of Health for the NHS. 14 Implementation of the phased contingency plan response raised a number of issues regarding NHS acute and primary care trust (PCT) preparedness. The most notable of these concerned the purchase and supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) consumable items such as masks, gowns and respirators, as clear lines of responsibility were difficult to identify. Implementation of infection control guidelines, including appropriate staff training were also highlighted as areas of concern.",

The prompt sharing of epidemiological and virological data through international collaboration was fundamental to understanding this newly emergent infection and informing the UK public health response, and underpinned an early recognition of the importance of 'real time' clinical epidemiology and the need for rapid liaison between clinicians, virologists and public health colleagues. 2. The formation of a National (UK) SARS Task Force contributed to consistent approaches to professional and public information and advice across the UK, particularly on the use of case definitions and management algorithms. 3. Flexible case reporting mechanisms need to be implemented at central, regional and local level during an evolving outbreak to inform appropriate public health measures. 4. SARS demonstrated the need for an integrated system of surveillance information, laboratory data and local public health response data, including contract tracing, to enable coordination and strengthening of the response across the UK. 5. Dissemination of timely guidance and advice during an evolving outbreak is crucial and requires close collaboration of key organisations to ensure regular and consistent situation updates. 6. A prolonged level of response to an incident such as SARS requires adequate surge capacity. This is being addressed through the development of an HPA Strategic Emergency Response, and contingency plans. 7. The rapidly evolving understanding of the diagnosis, clinical management and transmission of SARS underlined the importance of having explicit planning assumptions upon which critical control points of escalation of response within contingency plans were based.",
