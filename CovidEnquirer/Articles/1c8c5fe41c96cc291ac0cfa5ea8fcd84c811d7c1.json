Trypsin cleaved the al protein (49K molecular weight) approximately in the middle and yielded a 26K N-terminal fragment and a 23K C-terminal fragment. Under conditions which allowed for the identification of intact ~1 in the oligomeric form (-200K) by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the N-terminal 26K fragment was found to exist as stable trimers (80K) and, to a less extent, as dimers (54K), whereas the C-terminal fragment remained in the monomeric form. A polypeptide (161 amino acids) containing the N-terminal heptad repeat region synthesized in v&o was capable of forming stable dimers and trimers. Using various criteria, we demonstrated that the stability of the intact al oligomer is conferred mainly by the N-terminal heptad repeat region. Our results are summarized in a model in which individual heptad repeats are held together in a three-stranded a-helical coiled-coil structure via both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. o 1991 Academic PVS, I~C.",

In electron microscopy, this protein can sometimes be seen as lollipop-shaped structures with proximal fibrous tails and distal globular heads projecting from the surfaces of viral particles (Furlong et a/., 1988) . Protein al purified from reovirions or from a vaccinia expression system also has a similar morphology (Furlong et a/., 1988; Banerjea et a/., 1988; Fraser et a/., 1990) . The observations that the C-terminal half of al contains the receptor-binding domain (Nagata et al., 1987; Yeung et a/., 1989) and the N-terminal onequarter possesses intrinsic virion-anchoring property (Mah et a/., 1990) suggest that the fibrous tail and the globular head represent the N-and C-terminal portions, respectively, of this protein. These findings concur with sequence analysis of the reovirus Sl gene (encoding (rl), which predicts the existence of distinct structural domains in the al protein (Bassel-Duby et a/., 1985; Duncan et al., 1990; Nibert et al., 1990) .

            "text": "N-terminal one-third of al is highly a-helical and contains a heptapeptide repeat of hydrophobic residues, suggestive of a coiled-coil structure. This is followed by a middle region composed largely of P-sheets. The Cterminal one-third of 01 does not possess any distinct patterns and is therefore predicted to assume a complex globular structure. The oligomeric nature of al has also been examined (Bassel-Duby et al., 1987; Banerjea et a/., 1988) . When subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under dissociating conditions (boiled in SDS-containing sample buffer), the 455 amino acid long al migrates as a monomeric 44K molecular weight protein. However, if the boiling step is omitted, al migrates as an oligomer (-200K molecular weight) . This observation, coupled with the identification of a total of four bands upon chemical cross-linking of purified al (with the largest species migrating at a position corresponding to approximately 200K), has led to the suggestion that al is a tetramer (Bassel-Dubyetal., 1987) . The oligomerization state of al is apparently closely linked to its function since of the two al species (monomeric and oligomeric) synthesized in an in vitro transcription and translation system, only the oligomeric form is capable of binding to cell receptors (G. Leone, R. Duncan, and P. W. K. Lee, unpublished data) . This observation prompted us to examine the nature of al oligomerization, an understanding of which should lead to better definitions of structure-function relationships of this protein.",

Subsequent in vitro transcription and translation experiments revealed that the N-terminal one-third of al, which harbors the heptapeptide repeat region, possesses intrinsic dimerization and trimerization function.

Like the authentic protein, al oligomers synthesized in vitro were capable of binding to cell receptors (R. Duncan, G. Leone, and P. W. K. Lee, unpublished observations) , and were cleaved by trypsin to yield a well-defined pattern (see below). Some al monomers (44K) were also produced in this system, but they were not precipitable by the anti-al antibody, did not manifest cell-binding function, and were highly susceptible to degradation by trypsin or chymotrypsin even when these proteases were used at very low concentrations (data not shown).

To reconcile such differences, we decided to examine the effects of varying the trypsin concentration on al cleavage pattern. At the lowest concentration (0.005 mg/ml) of trypsin that cleaves al oligomers completely, an identical pattern to that shown in Fig. 2 was observed (Fig. 4A, lane 2) . Increasing the concentration of trypsin to 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5 mg/ml, and subsequently boiling the samples in sample buffer, resulted in the gradual disappearance of the 26K N-terminal fragment with the concomitant appearance, in almost stoichiometric amounts, of a 25K molecular weight band (Fig. 4A, lanes 3-5) .

In our hands, polyclonal anti-native al serum is incapable of recognizing the presumably denatured C-terminal tryptic fragment on a blot, although the N-terminal fragment is easily detectable. These observations, together with the fact that the trypsin concentration (1 mg/ml) used by Banerjea et al. was within the concentration range where we found both the 26K and the 25K N-terminal cleavage products, have led us to conclude that the two bands previously identified by these inves- tigators as N-terminal and C-terminal oligomers correspond to our 80K and 75K bands, and are therefore in fact both N-terminal oligomers.",

It was previously reported that al oligomers were rendered less stable when the concentration of P-mercaptoethanol in the sample buffer was reduced (Bassel-Duby et a/., 1987). Consistent with these findings, we observed that both native al oligomers and N-terminal trimers were less stable in the total absence of P-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 5C ). In summary, the stability of the N-terminal trimer was found to be very similar to that of the native al oligomer.

When the samples were boiled in sample buffer prior to SDS-PAGE, closely migrating bands of approximately 18K molecular weight were found (Fig. 7, lane 2) , as was predicted from the amino acid sequence. The lack of absolute homogeneity in size of the translational products was due to the absence of a translation stop codon in the mRNA transcripts, necessitating translation termination to occur by the falling off of ribosomes close to, but not precisely at, the 3'ends of the mRNAs. When identical samples were instead incubated at 37\" in sample buffer (Fig. 7, lane 3) , there was a noticeable decrease in the intensities of the bands migrating at approximately 18K. Concomitantly, two additional bands with estimated molecular weights of 36K and 54K appeared. These two bands corresponded to the dimeric (36K) and trimeric (54K) forms of the EcoRV translation products. Clearly, the dimer was the predominant oligomeric form identified. Whether trimer formation was inefficient or whether trimers were less stable in our SDS-PAGE system is not known. None-theless, for the first time, direct evidence is presented that demonstrates the intrinsic ability of a heptad repeat (18 repeats in this case) to form dimers and trimers, an ability that may very well depend on the number of repeats present in the polypeptide.",

The results are shown in Fig. 8 . Both the dimeric and trimeric forms of the heptad repeat were unstable at 50\", a temperature at which the N-terminal tryptic trimer was found to be stable. However, like the N-terminal trimer, heptad dimers and trimers were both stable under alkaline (pH 11.6) to mild acidic (pH 6.0) conditions (but dissociated at pH 5.5) and in 6 M urea, and were destabilized by the absence of P-mercaptoethanol or by the presence of divalent cations in the sample buffer. Again, as observed for the N-terminal tryptic trimer, the destabilizing effect of divalent cations could be neutralized by P-mercaptoethanol. FIG. 8.

Our present analysis of the two tryptic fragments of al has revealed that the stability of the ~1 oligomer is maintained mainly via the N-terminal fibrous portion, rather than the C-terminal globular portion of al. Under nondissociating conditions (preincubation in SDS-containing sample buffer at 37\" for 30 min), the N-terminal half of al, like intact ~1, migrates in SDS-PAGE as an oligomer (trimer), whereas the Cterminal half migrates as a monomer. We have evidence, however, that the latter ttyptic fragment is also a trimer (albeit a less stable one) which dissociates under the assay conditions used in the present study. The additional observation that both the N-terminal tryptic fragment and the full-length 01 oligomer respond to temperature and pH changes, and to p-mercaptoethanol in a similar manner, further suggests that the N-terminal half of al plays a major role in stabilizing the ul oligomer.",

In view of the recent speculations on the structural and functional aspects of the \"leucine zipper,\" we consider our direct demonstration that the heptad repeat possesses intrinsic dimerization and trimerization function to be significant (see also note added in proof). There is little doubt that, in the case of the trimer, apolar residues at positions a and d contribute to hydrophobic interactions that are responsible for holding the three strands together in a coiled-coil configuration (Figs. 9A and 9B). In addition, ionic interactions were also found to play a role since the dimers and trimers were destabilized by divalent cations but were restabilized by the addition of a chelator. Indeed, an examination of the distribution of charged residues in positions e and g reveals that when the three cu-helices are placed in parallel and in register to each other, residues of opposite charge on adjacent cu-helices invariably lie in juxtaposition (Fig. 9C ) (see also . At locations where a corresponding residue of opposite charge is not present on an adjacent a-helix, a spatially close residue on the same helix is present to neutralize the charge. Analysis of analogous regions on the al proteins of the other two serotypes reveals a similar, albeit less perfect, distribution pattern of charge residues (data not shown).",
