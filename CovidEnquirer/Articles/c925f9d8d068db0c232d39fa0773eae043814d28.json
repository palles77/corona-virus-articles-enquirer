The response is formulated by a number of different acute phase proteins (APP) that vary in magnitude and type among animal species. These systemic responders act as part of the innate immune defense system with the goal of reestablishing homeostasis and promoting healing. Several publications have documented the role of APP in response to experimental and infectious stimuli in animal models. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Over the past decade, APP have been more widely applied as biomarkers of inflammation in human and veterinary medicine.",

While the antigen receptor and its required gene recombination events are a more recent evolutionary acquisition of vertebrates, the innate immune system represents the core from which the adaptive immune system was based. Additionally, these two systems are often examined as mediating separate events. There is a true interface between the APR and adaptive immunity. Yoo and colleagues, with the use of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment of mice, demonstrated that the APR mobilizes antigen presentation by hepatocytes via MHC class I. 13 Others have demonstrated that the elimination of toll-like receptors affects both innate and adaptive immune responses. 15, 16 B. Induction of the APR The APR is initiated primarily by tissue macrophages, blood monocytes, and dendritic cells at the site of tissue damage when particular chemical structures in damaged tissue or infectious agents are presented for detection Tissue damage by these first-line defense cells. 17 These cells undergo a rapid activation leading to the production of the primary cytokines IL-1, TNF-a, and IL-6 which not only incite the APR but also result in the chemotactic recruitment of additional cells to the affected area to rapidly augment the response. The area of major APP production is the liver; specifically, the induction of APP expression in hepatocytes. APP have also been noted to be produced in other tissues. The production of the major APP serum amyloid A (SAA) has been demonstrated in the gastrointestinal tract, mammary gland, kidneys, and airways. 18, 19 The inflammatory stimuli may result in a differential production of cytokines, and the absence of some of the cytokines may abrogate the APR. In a study of LPS-induced inflammation of the mouse lung, the use of neutralizing antibody to IL-6 but not TNF-a resulted in the cessation of the APR. 20 In IL-6deficient mice, the intraperitoneal injection of LPS resulted in an overproduction of TNF-a but still a significant decrease in the production of SAA. 21 Similarly, in a mouse model of bacterial pneumonia, SAA increases were completely abrogated in IL-6-deficient mice. 22 In wild-type mice, IL-6 levels were increased in both the liver and the lungs of infected mice within 24 h of bacterial instillation.",

It was shown that these factors form a complex after interaction with IL-1 and IL-6 and then induce the transcription of the SAA gene. 23 In a mouse model where the levels of STAT3 were 24 In vitro studies further demonstrated that the loss of either STAT3 or RelA prevented SAA production in a hepatocyte cell line. 22 C. Other Effects of the APR While specific APP will be discussed in the following sections, it should be noted that the APR is often defined by a myriad of changes not limited to the well-known biomarkers alone (Fig. 1 ). In addition to the immune system, both the nervous and endocrine systems are also involved and stimulated by the cytokine production resulting in behavioral, physiologic, biochemical, and nutritional changes. 25 IL-6 stimulates the corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) synthesis in the hypothalamus which, in turn, modulates ACTH release from the pituitary and glucocorticoid production in the adrenal gland; this is the so called hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. In IL-6-deficient mice injected with LPS, CRH, and glucocorticoid levels were significantly lower than wild-type controls. 26 Other host responses include fever, fatigue, hypoglycemia, anorexia, lipolysis, and muscle catabolism. In the LPS injection model, there is nearly a 10% loss in body weight by day 1. 21 Both IL-6 and neural mechanisms have been implicated in this response. 21, 27 This is concomitant with a significant decrease in food intake and serum glucose. Fever is thought also to be a response to IL-6 through the production of other mediators including prostaglandins which affect the hypothalamus. 28, 29 Decreases in serum iron and zinc concentrations are also often observed with their redistribution to the tissues where they assist in antioxidant activity. 25 Leukocytosis is initially mediated through the production of cortisol by the removal of marginal pool cells from the tissues and placement in the blood in what is often called an immediate stress response. The true leukocytosis follows some days after the effects of the proinflammatory cytokine response and its positive effect on the bone marrow, and often involves enhanced levels of both lymphocytes and neutrophils.",

Positive APP increase in concentration and include most of the described proteins. Negative APP decrease in concentration and include albumin and transferrin (in nonavian species). APP are further classified on the basis of the magnitude of their increase. 3, 8, 35 Major APP represent those proteins that increase 10-to 1000-fold; most have negligible levels in normal animals. These are often the first responders with rapid increases of large magnitude within 24-48 h of the stimulus. Moderate APP have higher basal levels than major APP and increase 5-to 10-fold with peak levels occurring 3 or more days after the stimulus. Minor APP increase slowly with increases often less than twofold. It should be considered that these classifications are not formalized as such they are dependent on both the type of assay performed and the type of stimulus. In various reviews, there are often discordant classifications of some APP. Of note, the classification of APP by these categories differs by species; this will be further discussed in Section IV.

There are different subtypes and these may vary with species. 8 HP binds free hemoglobin which may be released during various autoimmune, infectious, or inherited diseases. 53 This HP-hemoglobin complex is phagocytosed by macrophages via the CD163 receptor. In mouse models, clearance is rapid with a half-life of less than 50 min. 53 In HP-deficient mice, high levels of hemoglobin are found to accumulate in the kidney. 54 The effective binding to CD163 has been found to stimulate cytokine production, and HP has also been linked to protease activity and immune suppression. 55 Interestingly, HP is found both in mammals and in fish but not in chickens and in frogs where another hemoglobin-binding protein has been identified called PIT54. 56 Assays for HP in animals are often via spectrophotometry using the natural affinity of HP for hemoglobin. 57 Immunoassays for human HP which show cross-reactivity with animal HP are also available but are not widely implemented. 58 D. Other APP Alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) is a highly glycosylated protein which has the ability to bind drugs including heparin, serotonin, steroids, and histamine. 59 This protein has also been implicated in anti-inflammatory responses and has been described to bind LPS. 59, 60 Assays for AGP in animals are commonly performed via radial immunodiffusion making this particular APP unenviable for use as a rapid diagnostic test.

Decreases can be attributed to protein loss due to kidney or gastrointestinal disease or edema and also due to decreased synthesis related to liver disease or malnutrition. 33 In mammals, the iron transporter transferrin (TN) is also a negative APP, although in avian species it has been shown to increase with the APR. 67, 68 F. Quantitation of APP Given the broad range of APP, the differences which occur at the species levels (see Section IV), and the rapid changes in technology over the past 25 years, it is understandable that many of the publications referenced in this review have used a myriad of techniques to assess the APR. At the research level, proteomic profiling has been utilized. With the maturation of immunoassays, immunodiffusion tests, ELISA, and immunoturbidimetric assays have been employed. Where possible, colorimetric assays have also been implemented. Lastly, the APR has been broadly judged by the use of serum protein electrophoresis. This method provides quantitation of albumin and then fractions of APP which are grouped as alpha 1, alpha 2, beta, and gamma globulins based on their migration characteristics. 33 Major benefits of this method are not having the need for species-specific reagents and the assessment of the complete APR-albumin and the groups of APP. Protein electrophoresis has been commonly implemented in avian species as an adjunct test to infectious disease assessments. 69, 70 A negative to this assay is the limits of detection as fraction sensitivity is at the g/dL level rather than the mg/L level obtained by specific APP assays. 71 APP assays have become more available to researchers and veterinarians in recent years. In many cases, labor intensive and costly ELISA-based assays have been replaced by automated assays that have heterologous cross-reactivity with many species. Examples of this type of assay include the Eiken SAA immunoturbidimetric assay (a human assay which reactive with horse and cat but not dog SAA) and the Randox reagents for CRP (a human assay which is reactive with dog CRP). 45, 72 These assays afford a commercial source of reagents negating lengthy developmental time. In other cases, species-specific reagents are preferred. These include an immunoturbidimetric assay for feline AGP and a pig-MAP-specific ELISA. 61, 66 These needs are based more on the unique APP in particular species which defies the routine use of human or other reagents.",

Within this very review, reference intervals have not been presented due to the diverse types of assays that have been used in the various research studies. This problem was recognized more than 10 years ago at which time a proposal was made to harmonize the types of assays performed among major international laboratories as well as to distribute a reference sample for intralaboratory testing. 73 This was formalized into the development of a Concerted Action Group as well as a Colloquium of Acute Phase Proteins where assay information and research findings could be more regularly distributed. 74 The positive implementation of APP assays is linked to the development of reference intervals. As discussed above, this is very much method specific but other physiological differences also have a role. CRP levels were examined over a several-day period in normal dogs, and they were found to vary more than 10fold; no pattern of circadian rhythm was detected. 75 Others reported a low biological variability in CRP, HP, AGP, and FIB in dogs 76 Age has been demonstrated to influence APP production. In a rat model of LPS stimulation, significantly decreased HP and AGP were observed in aged animals. 77 In dogs injected with turpentine oil, significantly higher levels of CRP were found in dogs over 3 months versus 1 month of age. 78 Lower resting levels of AGP were observed in these very young dogs versus older dogs prompting the proposal that age should be considered when using and interpretating APP results. 79 Similar recommendations were made for newborn dairy calves that gave high levels of APP post-birth followed by a significant decrease through day 21 and eventual stabilization. 80 It should also be recognized that APP levels may also be husbandry and strain/breed related as well as reflective of altered physiology or treatment status. Germ-free mice, injected with LPS, were observed to have a lower SAA response. 81 Similar differences were observed in dogs housed in clean versus dirty husbandry conditions. 82 In addition, SAP low responder and higher responder strains of mice were described; this was not strongly linked to the H-2 complex. 83 Differences in pig-MAP levels were also described between Large White and Meishan breeds. 84 Pregnancy was also reported to alter CRP levels by nearly 10-fold in dogs. 85 Additionally, glucocorticoid treatment and other drugs have described to result in a persistent HP increase. 2",

While an early increase (marginal response) in total white blood cells (WBC) was observed, the higher magnitude response was not present until days 4-7. A gradual decrease in serum albumin was present through day 14. The maximal decrease was less than 50% of day 0 values. CRP levels were increased 400-fold by day 2 postinjection and normalized by day 14. Serum AGP was increased approximately twofold on a similar timeline with maximal levels on day 3. Similar results can be found in a study of LPS injection in a model of arthritis in horses. 87 An early increase in WBC occurs within 24 h of the stimulus. SAA increases by 24 h with peak values at 48 h and elevated levels through day 5. APP are commonly compared to WBC and fibrinogen as they are longstanding hallmarks of inflammatory processes. In a large study of samples from dogs with various inflammatory processes, only a weak correlation (r \u00bc 0. 44) was observed between CRP levels and WBC counts but no correlation to the presence of band neutrophils which generally indicate bone marrow stimulation. 88 In a smaller study, a poor correlation (r \u00bc 0.34) was observed between the CRP and the presence of band neutrophils. 89 A positive correlation was observed between HP and FIB in dogs with various diseases. 90 In a study of horses with various conditions, SAA and FIB were found to be consistently elevated in those animals with bacterial infection, whereas low or normal total WBC and neutrophil counts were observed. 91 In our own laboratory, we have compared inflammatory markers in both dogs and horses with various diseases (C. Cray, 2011). The mean total WBC values, while significantly higher than the control group, did not exceed normal reference intervals for this determination. Similarly, there was a mild decrease in the A/G ratio and a mild increase in the fibrinogen between the clinical groups. Changes for all these determinations were less than twofold. Notably, a 70-and 20-fold mean increase was observed for SAA and CRP in horses and dogs, respectively. It is this magnitude of difference which makes the clinical use of APP especially attractive. 5 As major APP are normally either not present or present in very low levels, increases are rapid and persistent as other minor and moderate APP are produced during later stages of inflammation.",

For example, some animals are viewed in a clinical sense as a colony or herd (i.e., laboratory animals, cows, etc.) which create an opportunity for possible novel applications of APP assessment (see Section III.D). Many prototypic studies on animal APP have been conducted using inflammatory agents such as LPS, croton oil, and turpentine oil.

Several models of infection have also been examined. Experimental infection with rodent infectious agents Sendai virus and mouse parvovirus was found to not induce an APR; this was also examined in mice naturally infected with several agents which commonly occur in laboratory animal colonies. 48 In contrast, experimental infection with malaria was observed to result in increased SAP levels. 137 SAP and HP levels were documented in an experimental model of Trypanosoma infection. 138 Increases were present early postinfection as well as with the onset of posttreatment encephalopathy.",

In a study of over 200 dogs, a mean increase of 20fold and 7-fold was observed for CRP and HP, respectively (C. Cray, 2011). These represented animals with varied diseases and disorders including neoplasia, trauma, infection, and autoimmune disorders. Our data are supported by numerous reports of specific diseases and disorders, part of which are reviewed in the following paragraphs and have been previously reviewed by others. 2 In a study of the intramuscular injection of turpentine oil in dogs, CRP levels were increased 400-fold by day 2 postinjection and normalization by day 14. CRP increases can certainly be observed in animals with natural infection and disease, but the magnitude of increase is not as common. In a large study of dogs (n \u00bc 928) with various diseases, CRP was found to be a major APP with a weak correlation with total WBC counts and a weak negative correlation with albumin. 88 Consistently, high levels of CRP were observed in cases with pyometra, polyarthritis, pancreatitis, and panniculitis. Many metabolic diseases were observed not to have significant increases including epilepsy, hypothyroidism, rhinitis, bronchitis, and diabetes.

Others reported significant increases in cats with renal failure and feline lower urinary tract disease. 170 Increases in AGP and HP were observed in cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and feline immunodeficiency virus as well in cats with symptoms similar to FIP. 171 A moderate increase in AGP was found to discriminate FIP cats from cats with other inflammatory processes, and a marked increase was supportive of a FIP diagnosis. 172 In a study of the efficacy of different diagnostic tests for FIP, AGP was reported to have 100% sensitivity and specificity. 173 Other studies have indicated that the assessment of AGP in peritoneal fluid-where a common effusion occurs in acutely ill cats-is correlated with the definitive diagnosis of this infectious disease. 61, 171 APP changes were also found in cats infected with feline coronavirus which can progress to FIP disease; the investigators postulated that APP other than SAA, AGP, and HP might have a role in monitoring the progression of disease. 174 The APR was also examined in cats naturally infected with Chlamydophila which commonly results in ocular disease. Higher levels of SAA but not AGP were observed in seropositive animals that were actively shedding the organism.",

            "text": "The innate immune response of fish is a subject of an extensive review. 224 CRP and SAP like biomarkers have been reported in several species of fish, and both in vivo and in vitro studies have identified SAA. Bacterial infection in trout has been described to result in a 3000-fold increase in SAA. 225 Earlier studies documented the diverse inflammatory response to bacteria, virus, and experimental agents. 226 Both TN and HP were identified as major APP in another teleost. 227 This indicates that TN is a positive APP as observed in avian species. A2M has also been documented in fish. 224 APP have also been reported in marine mammals. Harr and colleagues studied the cross-reactivity of SAA, HP, AGP, and CRP assays in serum of manatees. 228 CRP and AGP assays were described to not cross-react with the test sera, although, perhaps, this indicates that these are not major APP in this species. SAA was reported to have the highest diagnostic sensitivity for inflammatory disease in this species versus FIB, HP, and total WBC. We have similarly observed SAA to be a valuable prognostic marker in stressed and injured manatees. (C. Cray, 2011) . In other studies, specific CRP assays were produced for use with serum samples from harbor seals. 229 Animals with pneumonia and other inflammatory processes were found to have as much as a 50-fold increase. HP in harbor seals was characterized in two recent publications. 230, 231 V. Concluding Remarks Dramatic increases in APP occur in response to inflammation and tissue injury, and this process is essential to the development of an innate immune response. The APR is conserved among different species which is a further reflection of its critical function. Although there is marked species variation among the proteins, this has not only resulted in a wealth of publications in different animals but has also facilitated the development of several speciesspecific and heterologous assays which can be employed to quantitate APP. The implementation of these assays has provided results that have demonstrated clear benefits at the research level with the association of APP with diagnosis, prognosis, the detection of subclinical disease, and applications to food safety. The excitement regarding the applications of APP has been measurable for years. 6, 9, 232, 233 At this time, the only impediments are the need for education and acceptance of veterinary practitioners and the more ready access to these methods at the reference laboratory level. APP testing which is available today represents just the start of newly emerging biomarkers for use in animals. As technology improves and research studies ensue, a further understanding of APP and the APR in animals will result in an important step in health monitoring, understanding innate immunity, and potential therapeutic interventions of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases in animals and humans.",
