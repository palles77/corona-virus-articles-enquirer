            "text": "Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is an essential virulence factor of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus and of the apoptosis associated with the pathogenesis of H5N1. Previous studies have revealed that the NS1 protein is able to induce apoptosis via an extrinsic pathway. However, it remains unclear whether the intrinsic pathway is also associated with this apoptosis. The present study used a clone of the NS1 gene from avian influenza A/Jiangsu/1/2007 and observed the localization of the NS1 protein and cytochrome c release from mitochondria and the change of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in lung cancer cells. Cytotoxicity was detected using an MTT assay and the number of apoptotic cells was counted using a flow cytometer. Following the isolation of mitochondria, western blotting was performed to compare cytochrome c release from the mitochondria in cells before and after apoptosis. The change of MMP was detected using JC-1 staining. Furthermore, the results reveal that the majority of the NS1 protein was localized in the cell nucleus, and that it may induce apoptosis of human lung epithelial cells. The apoptosis occurred with marked cytochrome c release from mitochondria and a change of the MMP. This indicated that the NS1 protein may be associated with apoptosis induced by an intrinsic mitochondrial pathway.",

The cumulative number of confirmed human cases of H5N1 from 14 countries between November 2003 and July 2014 reached 667, 393 of which were fatal according to a report issued by the World Health Organization (2). In total, 47 individuals infected with H5N1 were identified in China and 30 (63.8%) succumbed to the H5N1 infection (2). H5N1 causes primary viral pneumonia with rapid progression to lung failure following invasion of epithelial cells in the upper and lower respiratory tracts (3) . However, the exact mechanism for elucidating the severity of human H5N1 infection remains unclear. Previously, apoptosis was not only observed in the alveolar epithelial cells of 2 patients who succumbed to H5N1 infection, but was also induced by H5N1 in numerous cell types in vivo and in vitro (4) (5) (6) . These results indicated that apoptosis may be important in H5N1 pathogenesis in the human body.",

Compared with cells transfected with empty vector, the viability of NS1-transfected cells was markedly lower (Fig. 2) .

In order to confirm this, MMP was initially detected by JC-1 staining. Normal cells stained with JC-1 emitted mitochondrial orange-red fluorescence with a slight green fluorescence, whereas the ratio of orange-red and green fluorescence was inverted when cell apoptosis was induced by NS1 protein. As shown in Fig. 5 , in comparison with the empty vector transfected cells group, NS1 transfected cells significantly initiated apoptosis with STS (the ratio of fluorescence intensity at 555/488 nm was ~1.00; P<0.05).

Additionally, the NS1 protein together with STS was able to cause the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol, and the change of MMP. During the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis process, the permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane is the critical step, which results in the release of several apoptogenic factors from the intermembrane space of mitochondria (20) (21) (22) . Cytochrome c is one of these factors, which binds to the adaptor apoptotic peptidase-activating factor 1 that subsequently recruits cytosolic pro-caspase-9 into a heptameric apoptosome (23) . The intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis pathway is one of the major pathways during viral pathogenesis that include human immunodeficiency virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (24, 25) .",

Therefore, the study by Zhang et al (10) did not have enough evidence to support that the NS1 of H5N1 induced apoptosis through an extrinsic pathway. In the present study, the efficiency of NS1 in inducing apoptosis is lower than that of STS, however, the increasing synergistic effect on inducing apoptosis between STS and NS1 were observed. In addition, in the present study, the plasmid with the NS1 gene was transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 and the transfecting efficiency was lower than the penetrating ability of STS. At this point, although the capacity of inducing apoptosis of NS1 is weaker than STS in the present study, the importance of each one needs to be investigated further. Previous studies have revealed that the NS1 protein of influenza A viruses is a multifunctional viral protein that modulates the virus replication cycle and viral protein synthesis, and HA and neuropilin-1 (NP1) of H5N1 also induce apoptosis of airway epithelial cells (26, 27) . In vivo, there is a need to determine whether the synergetic effect on inducing apoptosis by NP1, nucleoprotein and HA exists. In particular, these proteins induce apoptosis by either sharing the same pathway or not.",
