The epidemic outbreak cased by coronavirus 2019-nCoV is of great interest to researches because of the high rate of spread of the infection and the significant number of fatalities. A detailed scientific analysis of the phenomenon is yet to come, but the public is already interested in the questions of the duration of the epidemic, the expected number of patients and deaths. For long time predictions, the complicated mathematical models are necessary which need many efforts for unknown parameters identification and calculations. In this article, some preliminary estimates will be presented.",

The first estimations of V exponential growth, typical for the initial stages of every epidemic (see e.g., [4] ) have been done in [3] . For long time predictions, more complicated mathematical models are necessary. For example, a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model was used in [2] . Nevertheless, the complicated models need more efforts for unknown parameters identification. This procedure may be especially difficult, if reliable data are limited.",

Nevertheless, this the value of r is very close to the optimal one r=0.997966487046645 for the values of parameters located in the vicinity of the optimal point N=90611; \uf06e =65546.5, since the maximum of regression coefficient at this point is not sharp. This fact can question the procedure of the parameter identification. The calculations must be refreshed after obtaining new data.
