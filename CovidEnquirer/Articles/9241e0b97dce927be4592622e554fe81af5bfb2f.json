Global attention has focused on the potential for spread of MERS-CoV after the Hajj pilgrimage during which Muslims from 180 countries converge in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. Such pilgrims have a high risk for respiratory tract infections because of severe overcrowding. The International Health Regulations Emergency Committee advised all countries (particularly those with returning pilgrims) to strengthen their surveillance capacities and ensure robust reporting of any identified cases (2).",

Participants in the survey were adult Hajj pilgrims who traveled together in a group (through 1 travel agency in Marseille, France) from October 3 through October 24, 2013. Pilgrims were included in the study on a voluntary basis and were asked to sign a written consent form. All pilgrims received advice about individual prevention measures against respiratory tract infection before departing, and follow-up was conducted during the journey by a medical doctor who systematically documented travel-associated diseases. Nasal swab specimens were obtained just before the pilgrims left Saudi Arabia, frozen <48 hours after sampling, and processed (3, 4) . Each sample was tested for MERS-CoV (upE and ORF1a genes) (5, 6) reported fever, and 61 (47.3%) had conditions that met the criteria for influenza-like illness (ILI; i.e., the association of cough, sore throat, and subjective fever) (Figure) (4). One patient was hospitalized during travel (undocumented pneumonia). Nasal swab specimens were obtained from 129 pilgrims on October 23, 2013 (week 43), 1 day before pilgrims left Saudi Arabia for France; 90 (69.8%) pilgrims were still symptomatic. All PCRs were negative for MERS-CoV.",
