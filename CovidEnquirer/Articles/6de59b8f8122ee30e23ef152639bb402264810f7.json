A recombinant virus carrying the A25V amino acid substitution (Re-Nsp15-A25V) was generated from the parental MERS-CoV/EMC strain (Re-EMC/MERS) with a BAC reverse genetics system (9), which overcame the antiviral effect of ciclesonide (Fig. 1c) .

At 6 h post-infection, cellular RNA was isolated, and real-time PCR was conducted to quantify the amount of viral RNA (11). Ciclesonide and mometasone suppressed viral replication with a similar efficacy to lopinavir (Fig. 2a) . For comparison, viral cell entry inhibitors were tested. E64d substantially reduced viral RNA levels, but nafamostat and camostat had only modest antiviral effects, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 primarily utilized the cathepsin/endosomal pathway of cell entry rather than the TMPRSS2/cell surface pathway to enter TMPRSS2-expressing cells, consistent with a recent study (12). author/funder.
