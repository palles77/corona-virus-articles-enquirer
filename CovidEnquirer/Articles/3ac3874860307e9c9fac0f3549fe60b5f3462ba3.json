Everything in the New Public Health is about preventing avoidable disease, injuries, disabilities, and death while promoting and maximizing a healthy environment and optimal conditions for current and future generations. Thus, the New Public Health addresses overall health policy, resource allocation, as well as the organization, management, and provision of medical care and of health systems in general within a framework of overall social policy and in a community, state, national, transnational, and global context.",

This chapter examines the very base of the New Public Health, which encompasses the classic issues of public health with recognition of the advances made in health promotion and the management of health care systems as integral components of societal efforts to improve the health of populations and of individuals. What follows in succeeding chapters will address the major concepts leading to modern and comprehensive elements of public health. Inevitably, concepts of public health continue to evolve and to develop both as a philosophy and as a structured discipline. As a professional field, public health requires specialists trained with knowledge and appreciation of its evolution, scientific advances, concepts, and best practices, old and modern. It demands sophisticated professional and managerial skills, the ability to address a problem, reasoning to define the issues, and to advocate, initiate, develop, and implement new and revised programs. It calls for profoundly humanistic values and a sense of responsibility towards protecting and improving the health of communities and every individual. In the twenty-first century, this set of values was well expressed in the Human Development Index agreed to by 160 nations (Box 2.1).",

The sanitary revolution, which preceded the development of modern bacteriology, made an enormous contribution to improved health, but many other societal factors including improved nutrition, education, and housing were no less important for population health. Maternal and child health, occupational health, and many other aspects of a growing public health network of activities played important roles, as have the physical and social environment and personal habits of living in determining health status. In recent decades recognition of the importance of women's health and health inequalities associated with many high-risk groups in the population have seen both successes and failures in addressing their challenges.

This was termed the miasma theory, and while without a direct scientific explanation, it was acted upon in the early to mid-nineteenth century and promoted by leading public health theorists including Florence Nightingale, with practical and successful measures to improve sanitation, housing, and social conditions, and having important results in improving health conditions. The competing germ theory developed by pioneering nineteenthcentury epidemiologists (Panum, Snow, and Budd), scientists (Pasteur, Cohn, and Koch), and practitioners (Lister and Semmelweiss) led to the science of bacteriology and a revolution in practical public health measures. The combined application of the germ (agent-host-environment) and miasma theories (social and sanitary environment) has been the basis of classic public health, with enormous benefits in the control of infectious and other diseases or harmful conditions. The revolutionary changes occurring since the 1960s have brought about a decline in cardiovascular and cancer mortality, and conceptual changes such as Health for All and Health in All to bring health issues to all policies at both governmental and individual levels. The concepts of public health advanced with the 1974 Marc Lalonde Health Field Concept (New Perspectives on the Health of Canadians, 1974) , stating that health was the result of the physical and social environment, lifestyle and personal habits, genetics, as well as organization and provision of medical care.",

A specific agent, a method of transmission, and a susceptible host are involved in an interaction, which are central to the infectivity or severity of the disease.

The health system includes access to competent and responsible primary care as well as by the wider health system, including health promotion, specific prevention and population-based health protection. The paradigm of the host-agent-environment triad (Figures 2.2 and 2. 3) is profoundly affected by the wider context. The sociopolitical environment and organized efforts at intervention affect the epidemiological and clinical course of disease of the individual. Medical care is essential, as is public health, but the persistent health inequities seen in most regions and countries require societal attention. Success or failure in improving the conditions of life for the poor, and other vulnerable \"risk groups\", affect national or regional health status and health system performance. The health system is meant to reduce the occurrence or bad outcome of disease, either directly by primary prevention or treatment as secondary prevention or by maximum rehabilitation as tertiary prevention, or equally important indirectly by reducing community or individual risk factors.",

Their concern focused on harsh living and health conditions among the urban poor working class and neglectful political norms of the time. Social medicine also developed as an academic discipline and advocacy orientation by providing statistical evidence showing, as in various governmental reports in the mid-nineteenth century, that poverty among the working class was associated with short life expectancy and that social conditions were key factors in the health of populations and individuals. This movement provided the basis for departments in medical faculties and public health education throughout the world stressing the close relationship between political priorities and health status.

Since the late 1970s, a selective and specific approach to screening has become widely accepted. This involves defining risk categories for specific diseases and bearing in mind the potential for remedial action. Early case finding of colon cancer by routine fecal blood testing and colonoscopy has been found to be effective, and Pap smear testing to discover cancer of the cervix is timed according to risk category. Screening for colorectal cancer is essential for modern health programs and has been adopted by most industrialized countries. Outreach programs by visits, telephones, emails or other modern methods of communication are important to contact non-attenders to promote utilization, and have been shown to increase compliance with proven effective measures. These programs are important for screening, follow-up, and maintenance of treatment for hypertension, diabetes, and other conditions requiring long-term management. Screening technology is changing and often the subject of intense debate as such programs are costly and their cost-effectiveness is an important matter for policy making: screening for lung cancer is becoming a feasible and effective matter for high-risk groups, whereas breast cancer screening frequency is now in dispute; while nanotechnology and bioengineering promises new methods for cancer screening.",

The fact that this vaccination prevents the occurrence of herpes zoster or shingles later in life may also be a justification. Widespread adoption of hepatitis B vaccine is justified on the grounds that it prevents cancer of the liver, liver cirrhosis, and hepatic failure in a high percentage of the population affected. How many cases of a disease are enough to justify an intervention? One or several cases of some diseases, such as poliomyelitis, may be considered an epidemic in that each case constitutes or is an indicator of a wider threat. A single case of polio suggests that another 1000 persons are infected but have not developed a recognized clinical condition. Such a case constitutes a public health emergency, and forceful organization to meet a crisis is needed. Current standards are such that even one case of measles imported into a population free of the disease may cause a large outbreak, as occurred in the UK, France, and Israel during 2007 through 2013, by contacts on an aircraft, at family gatherings, or even in medical settings. A measles epidemic indicates a failure of public health policy and practice. Screening for some cancers, such as cervix and colon, is cost effective. Screening of all newborns for congenital disorders is important because each case discovered early and treated effectively saves a lifetime of care for serious disability.",

David Marine of the Cleveland Clinic and David Cowie, professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan, proposed the prevention of goiter by iodization of salt. Marine carried out a series of studies in fish, and then in a controlled clinical trial among schoolgirls in 1917-1919, with startlingly positive results in reducing the prevalence of goiter. Cowie campaigned for the iodization of salt, with support from the medical profession. In 1924, he convinced a private manufacturer to produce Morton's iodized salt, which rapidly became popular throughout North America. Similarly, iodized salt came to be used in many parts of Europe, mostly without governmental support or legislation. Iodine-deficiency disorders (IDDs) remain a widespread condition, estimated to have affected 2 billion people worldwide in 2013. The target of international eradication of IDDs by 2000 was set at the World Summit for Children in 1990, and the WHO called for universal iodization of salt in 1994. By 2008, nearly 70 percent of households in developing countries consumed adequately iodized salt. China and Nigeria, have had great success in recent years with mandatory salt fortification in increasing iodization rates, in China from 39 percent to 95 percent in 10 years. But the problem is not yet gone and even in Europe there is inadequate standardization of iodine levels and population follow-up despite decades of work on the problem.",

They focused the activities of an organization and its budget on targets, rather than on previous allocation of resources. These concepts were applied in other spheres, but they influenced thinking in health, whose professionals were seeking new ways to approach health planning. The logical application was to define health targets and to promote the efficient use of resources to achieve those targets. This occurred in the USA and soon afterwards in the WHO European Region. In both cases, a wide-scale process of discussion and consensus building was used before reaching definitive targets. This process contributed to the adoption of the targets by many countries in Europe as well as by states and many professional and consumer organizations. The USA developed national health objectives in 1979 for the year 1990 and subsequently for the year 2000, with monitoring of progress in their achievement and development of further targets for 2010 and now for 2020. Beginning in 1987, state health profiles are prepared by the Epidemiology Program Office of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention based on 18 health indicators recommended by a consensus panel representing public health associations and organizations.",

The target is to reduce by two-thirds, between 1990 and 2015, the under-5-year-old mortality rate, from 93 children of every 1000 dying to 31 of every 1000. Child deaths are falling, but much more needs to be done in order to reach the development goal. Revitalizing efforts against pneumonia and diarrhea, while bolstering nutrition, could save millions of children. l MDG5. Improve maternal health -Maternal mortality has nearly halved since 1990, but levels are far removed from the 2015 target. The targets for improving maternal health include reducing by three-quarters the maternal mortality ratio and achieve universal access to reproductive health. Poverty and lack of education perpetuate high adolescent birth rates. Inadequate funding for family planning is a major failure in fulfilling commitments to improving women's reproductive health. l MDG6. Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and other diseases -More people than ever are living with HIV owing to fewer AIDS-related deaths and the continued large number of new infections. In 2011, an estimated 34.2 million were living with HIV, up 17 percent from 2001. This persistent increase reflects the continued large number of new infections along with a significant expansion of access to lifesaving antiretroviral therapy, especially in more recent years. l MDG7. Ensure environmental sustainability -The unparalleled success of the Montreal Protocol shows that action on climate change is within grasp. The 25th anniversary of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, in 2012, had many achievements to celebrate. Most notably, there has been a reduction of over 98 percent in the consumption of ozone-depleting substances. Further, because most of these substances are also potent greenhouse gases, the Montreal Protocol has contributed significantly to the protection of the global climate system. The reductions achieved to date leave hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) as the largest group of substances remaining to be phased out. l MDG8. A global partnership for development -Core development aid fell in real terms for the first time in more than a decade, as donor countries faced fiscal constraints. In 2011, net aid disbursements amounted to $133.5 billion, representing 0.31 percent of developed countries' combined national income. While constituting an increase in absolute dollars, this was a 2.7 percent drop in real terms over 2010.

Individual or clinical measures include professional advice on how best to reduce the risk of the disease by early diagnosis and implementation of appropriate therapy. Population-based measures involve indirect measures with government action banning cigarette advertising, or direct taxation on cigarettes. Mandating food quality standards, such as limiting the fat content of meat, and requiring food labeling laws are part of the control of cardiovascular diseases. The way individuals act is central to the objective of reducing disease, because many non-infectious diseases are dependent on behavioral risk factors of the individual's choosing. Changing the behavior of the individual means addressing the way a person sees his or her own needs. This can be influenced by the provision of information, but how someone sees his or her own needs is more complex than that. An individual may define needs differently from the society or the health system. Reducing smoking among women may be difficult to achieve if smoking is thought to reduce appetite and food intake, given the social message that \"slim is beautiful\".

The technological and organizational revolutions in health care are accompanied by many ethical, economic, and legal dilemmas. The choices in health care include heart transplantation, an expensive life-saving procedure, which may compete with provision of funds and labor resources for immunizations for poor children or for health promotion to reduce smoking and other risk factors for chronic disease. New means of detecting and treating acute conditions such as myocardial infarction and peptic ulcers are reducing hospital stays, and improving long-term survival and quality of life. Imaging technology has been an important development in medicine since the advent of X-rays in the early twentieth century. Technology has forged ahead with high-technology instruments and procedures, new medication, genetic engineering, and important low-technology gains such as impregnated bed nets, simplified tests for HIV and TB, and many other \"game changers\". New technologies that can enable lower cost diagnostic devices, electronic transmission, and distant reading of transmitted imaging all open up possibilities for advanced diagnostic capacities in rural and less developed countries and communities. Molecular biology has provided methods of identifying and tracking movement of viruses such as polio and measles from place to place, greatly expanding the potential for appropriate intervention.",

These achievements were also seen in all developed countries over the past century and are beginning to be seen in developing countries as well. They reflect a successful application of a broad approach to prevention and health promotion along with improved medical care and growing access to its benefits. In the past several decades alone, major new innovations are leading to greater control of cardiovascular disease, cancer prevention, and many other improvements to health affecting hundreds of millions of people. A similar 2011 report by the CDC shows global progress in the first decade of the twenty-first century, while MDG reports show progress on all eight target topics, although not at uniformly satisfactory rates.

These are a recognition and a challenge to the international community and public health as a profession and as organized systems. Formal education in newly developing schools of public health is increasing in Europe, including many countries of Eastern Europe, and beginning to develop in India and sub-Saharan Africa. But there is delay in establishing centers of postgraduate education and research in many developing countries which are concentrating their educational resources on training physicians. Many physicians from developing nations are moving to the developed countries, which have become dependent on these countries for a significant part of their supply of medical doctors. Progress in implementation of the MDGs is mixed in sub-Saharan Africa, making some progress in immunization, but falling back on other goals. Proposals to renew global health targets following the 2015 end-stage of the MDG health goals will need to add a focus on NCDs, which account for 60 percent of global deaths, including 8.1 million premature deaths below the age of 60 (UNDP).",

Inequalities in health exist in and between affluent and developing societies, as well as within countries, even those having advanced health care systems. Regional inequalities are seen across the European Region in an east-west gradient and globally a north-south divide of extremes of inequality. The global environmental and ecological degradation and pollution of air and water present grave challenges for developed and developing countries worldwide. Yet optimism can be derived from proven track records of success in public health measures that have already been implemented. Many of the underlying factors are amenable to prevention through social, environmental, or behavioral change and effective use of medical care. The New Public Health idea has evolved since Alma-Ata, which articulated the concept of Health for All, followed by a trend in the late 1970s to Health in All policies and establishing health targets as a basis for health planning. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the debate on the future of public health in the Americas intensified as health professionals looked for new models and approaches to public health research, training, and practice. This debate helped to redefine traditional approaches of social, community, and preventive medicine. The search for the \"new\" in public health continued with a return to the Health for All concept of Alma-Ata (renewed in 2008) and a growing realization that the health of both the individual and the society involves the management of personal care services and community prevention, with a comprehensive approach taking advantage of advancing technology and experience of best practices globally.",

Health status, therefore, should be of concern to policy makers in every sector, not solely those involved in health policy.

The specific objectives set for Healthy People 2020 are listed in Box 2.16. Thirteen new topic areas are listed for 2020, such as older adults, genomics, dementias, and social determinants of health. These provide guidelines for national, state, and local public health agencies as well as insurance providers, primary care services, and health promotion advocates. A key issue will be in reducing regional, ethnic, and socioeconomic health disparities.The process of working towards health targets in the USA has moved down from the federal level of government to the state and local levels. Professional organizations, NGOs, as well as community and fraternal organizations are also involved. The states are encouraged to prepare their own targets and implementation plans as a condition for federal grants, and many states require county health departments to prepare local profiles and targets.Diffusion of this approach encourages state and local initiatives to meet measurable program targets. It also sets a different agenda for local prestige in competitive terms, with less emphasis on the size of the local hospital or other agencies than on having the lowest infant mortality or the least infectious disease among neighboring local authorities.",

            "text": "National policy in health ultimately relates to health of the individual. The various concepts outlined in the health field concept, community-oriented primary health care, health targets, and effective management of health systems, can only be effective if the individual and his or her community are knowledgeable participants in seeking solutions. Involving the individual in his or her own health status requires raising levels of awareness, knowledge, and action. The methods used to achieve these goals include health counseling, health education, and health promotion (Figure 2 .6).Health counseling has always been a part of health care between the doctor or nurse and the patient. It raises levels of awareness of health issues of the individual patient. Health education has long been part of public health, dealing with promoting consciousness of health issues in selected target population groups. Health promotion incorporates the work of health education but takes health issues to the policy level of government and involves all levels of government and NGOs in a more comprehensive approach to a healthier environment and personal lifestyles.Health counseling, health education, and health promotion are among the most cost-effective interventions for improving the health of the public. While costs of health care are rising rapidly, demands to control cost increases should lead to greater emphasis on prevention, and adoption of health education and promotion as an integral part of modern life. This should be carried out in schools, the workplace, the community, commercial locations (e.g., shopping centers), and recreation centers, and in the political agenda.Psychologist Abraham Maslow described a hierarchy of needs of human beings. Every human has basic requirements including physiological needs of safety, water, food, warmth, and shelter. Higher levels of needs include recognition, community, and self-fulfillment. These insights supported observations of efficiency studies such as those of Elton Mayo in the famous Hawthorne effect in the 1920s, showing that workers increased productivity when acknowledged by management in the objectives of the organization (see Chapter 12). In health terms, these translate into factors that motivate people to positive health activities when all barriers to health care are reduced.Modern public health faces the problem of motivating people to change behavior; sometimes this requires legislation, enforcement, and penalties for failure to comply, such as in mandating car seat-belt use. In other circumstances it requires sustained performance by the individual, such as the use of condoms to reduce the risk of STI and/or HIV transmission. Over time, this has been developed into a concept known as knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and practices (KABP), a measurable complex that cumulatively affects health behavior (see Chapter 3). There is often a divergence between knowledge and practice; for example, the knowledge of the importance of safe driving, yet not putting this into practice. This concept is sometimes referred to as the \"KABP gap\". The health belief model has been a basis for health education programs, whereby a person's readiness to take action for health stems from a perceived threat of disease, a recognition of susceptibility to disease and its potential severity, and the value of health. Action by an individual may be triggered by concern and by knowledge. Barriers to appropriate action may be psychological, financial, or physical, including fear, time loss, and inconvenience. Spurring action to avoid risk to health is one of the fundamental goals in modern health care. The health belief model is important in defining any health intervention in that it addresses the emotional, intellectual, and other barriers to taking steps to prevent or treat disease.Health awareness at the community and individual levels depends on basic education levels. Mothers in developing countries with primary or secondary school education are more successful in infant and child care than less educated women. Agricultural and health extension services reaching out to poor and uneducated farm families in North America in the 1920s were able to raise consciousness of safe self-health practices and good nutrition, and when this was supplemented by basic health education in schools, generational differences could be seen in levels of awareness of the importance of balanced nutrition. Secondary prevention with diabetics and patients with CHD hinges on education and awareness of nutritional and physical activity patterns needed to prevent or delay a subsequent myocardial infarction.",

The resulting Ottawa Charter defined health promotion and set out five key areas of action: building healthy public policy, creating supportive environments, strengthening community action, developing personal skills, and reorienting health services. The Ottawa Charter called on all countries to put health on the agenda of policy makers in all sectors and at all levels, directing them to be aware A typical healthy city has a population in the multiple thousands, often multilingual, with an average middleclass income. A Healthy Cities project builds a coalition of municipal and voluntary groups working together in a continuing effort to improve quality of service, facilities, and living environment. The city is divided into neighborhoods, engaged in a wide range of activities fostered by the project. Municipalities have traditionally had a leading role in sanitation, safe water supply, building and zoning laws and regulation, and many other responsibilities in public health (see Chapter 10). The Healthy Cities or Communities movement has elevated this to a higher level with policies to promote health in all actions. Some examples are listed of municipal, advocacy group, and higher governmental activities for healthier city environments: Working with senior levels of government, other departments in the municipalities, religious organizations, private donors, and the NGO sector to innovate and especially to improve conditions in poverty-afflicted areas of cities is a vital role for health-oriented local political leadership.",

It evolved as a branch of demography, sociology, and anthropology, addressing the social and cultural contexts of disease, health risks, and human behavior. Human ecology addresses the interaction of humans with and adaptation to their social and physical environment.Parallel subdisciplines of social, community, and environmental psychology, medical sociology, anthropology, and other social sciences contributed to the development of this academic field with wide applications in health-related issues. This led to the incorporation of qualitative research methods alongside the quantitative research methods traditionally emphasized in public health, providing crucial insights into many public health issues where human behavior is a key risk factor.Health education developed as a discipline and function within public health systems in school health, rural nutrition, military medicine, occupational health, and many other aspects of preventive-oriented health care, and is discussed in later chapters of this text. Directed at behavior modification through information and raising awareness of consequences of risk behavior, this has become a longstanding and major element of public health practice in recent times, being almost the only effective tool to fight the epidemic of HIV and the rising epidemic of obesity and diabetes.Health promotion as an idea evolved, in part, from Marc Lalonde's Health Field Concepts and from growing realization in the 1970s that access to medical care was necessary but not sufficient to improve the health of a population. The integration of the health behavior model, social ecological approach, environmental enhancement, or social engineering formed the basis of the social ecology approach to defining and addressing health issues (Table 2 .3).Individual behavior depends on many surrounding factors, while community health also relies on the individual; the two cannot be isolated from one another. The ecological perspective in health promotion works towards changing people's behavior to enhance health. It takes into account factors not related to individual behavior, which are determined by the political, social, and economic environment. It applies broad community, regional, or national approaches that are needed to address severe public health problems, such as controlling HIV infection, TB, malnutrition, STIs, cardiovascular disorders, violence and trauma, and cancer. beginning to affect the health situation in countries in transition from the socialist period. Countries emerging from developing status are also showing signs of mixed progress in the dual burden of infectious and maternal/child health issues, along with growing exposure to the chronic diseases of developed nations such as cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and diabetes. The New Public Health synthesizes traditional pub lic health with management of personal services and community action for a holistic approach. Evaluation of costeffective public health and medical interventions to reduce the burden of disease also contributes to the need to seek and apply new approaches to health. The New Public Health will continue to evolve as a framework drawing on new ideas, science, technology, and experiences in public health throughout the world. It must address the growing recognition of social inequality in health, even in developed countries with universal health programs with improved education and social support systems.",
