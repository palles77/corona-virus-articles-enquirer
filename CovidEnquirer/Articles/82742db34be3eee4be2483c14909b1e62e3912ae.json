            "text": "Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an acute, febrile zoonotic disease that is caused by the RVF virus (RVFV). RVF is mainly prevalent on the Arabian Peninsula, the African continent, and several islands in the Indian Ocean near southeast Africa. RVFV has been classified by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) as a category A pathogen. To avoid biological safety concerns associated with use of the pathogen in RVFV neutralization assays, the present study investigated and established an RVFV pseudovirus-based neutralization assay. This study used the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) lentiviral packaging system and RVFV structural proteins to successfully construct RVFV pseudoviruses. Electron microscopy observation and western blotting indicated that the size, structure, and shape of the packaged pseudoviruses were notably similar to those of HIV lentiviral vectors. Infection inhibition assay results showed that an antibody against RVFV inhibited the infective ability of the RVFV pseudoviruses, and an antibody neutralization assay for RVFV detection was then established. This study has successfully established a neutralization assay based on RVFV pseudoviruses and demonstrated that this method can be used to effectively evaluate antibody neutralization.",

            "text": "Certain viruses, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Ebola virus (EBOV), and H5N1 subtype avian influenza virus, are highly infectious and highly pathogenic, presenting tremendous difficulties and dangers during research [8, 13, 19] . In contrast, pseudovirus technology is a very safe and effective research tool [18] . Briefly, a pseudovirus is a type of retrovirus that can integrate with the envelope glycoprotein of another type of virus to form a new virus with an exogenous viral envelope and a genome that maintains the characteristics of the retroviral genome. Compared with natural viruses, pseudoviruses integrate with the envelope protein of another virus by using an envelope protein-encoding gene within a modified nucleic acid molecule; pseudoviruses can only accomplish one infection cycle because they lose their self-replicating ability. Thus, pseudoviruses are more biologically safe than infectious viruses. Pseudoviruses also have extensive host ranges and higher transfection efficiencies, can be more easily concentrated than the original viruses, can defend against the deactivation function of serum complement, have a non-cell-cycle-dependent integration feature, and can efficiently transfect quiescent cells. Pseudovirus preparation is thus an effective, safe, and reliable method for application in the study of viruses with high pathogenicity that are difficult to culture in vitro. Because pseudoviruses are relatively safe and have the advantages of extensive host range, non-cell-cycle-dependence, and highly efficient transfection of quiescent cells, they can have particularly important roles in studies of virus-host cell interactions, neutralizing antibody titer evaluation, and gene therapy. Thus, pseudoviruses can be used as a novel, safe experimental tool.",

            "text": "Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an RNA virus in the Phlebovirus genus of the Bunyaviridae family [10] . In particular, RVFV is a high-risk pathogen that can induce fatal encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever in humans and ruminants [5, 11] . Due to its strong pathogenicity and fast dissemination, RVFV has attracted considerable worldwide attention. Currently, viral isolation, hemagglutination inhibition assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), agar gel immunodiffusion assays, immunofluorescence assays, radioimmunoassays, and complement fixation assays are the primary methods used to detect RVFV [16, 17] . Additionally, clinical detection of anti-RVFV antibodies is primarily accomplished by using the ELISA method [16] . Commonly used coating antigens include the envelope protein (Gn) and inactivated RVFV. However, this method can only preliminarily detect antibody levels in humans, and those results do not truly reflect whether the antibodies have pathogen-neutralizing, anti-RVFV, and anti-infection functions. Therefore, the virus neutralization assay has become an important clinical method for measuring antibody activity and evaluating immune status in humans. The neutralization assay typically uses natural viruses, which can cause infections in the assay operators and pose a risk of viral spread; thus, this assay is considered very dangerous. To avoid the potential risks associated with the neutralization assay, the present study used a lentiviral packaging system and targeted RVFV structural proteins to construct RVFV pseudoviruses to replace live viruses. The pseudoviruses were then used to establish an RVFV neutralization assay method to allow effective evaluation of human antibody titers.",

            "text": "Recently, pseudovirus technology has become a very effective tool in scientific research [6, 7, 14] and has demonstrated several unique application advantages. For example, in experimental studies, pseudoviruses can be used to replace high-risk viruses with greater pathogenicity and infectivity, with RVFV being a typical example. Compared with natural viruses, pseudovirus particles have similar patterns of cell infection, and pseudoviruses can also effectively simulate the early cell infection process of natural viruses. Additionally, free viral DNA or reporter genes (i.e., EGFP and LacZ) can be artificially introduced into pseudoviruses, and this approach is conducive to rapid and timely detection and analysis in a clinic. Furthermore, pseudoviruses exhibit defective replication (ensuring safe manipulation), avoid the risk of infection posed by high-risk viruses, and eliminate the risk of serious safety concerns such as release from the laboratory. Therefore, pseudoviruses can be used in studies of the mechanism underlying viral infection of host cells. More importantly, pseudoviruses can be used to replace the natural viruses used in traditional virus neutralization assays. Currently, neutralization assays incorporating pseudoviruses are becoming a new, effective route for the detection of neutralizing antibodies. The many types of currently established pseudoviruses available both domestically and internationally include Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), EBOV, hepatitis C virus, and SARS-CoV [4, 12, 20] . Some pseudoviruses have been successfully applied in drug screening, neutralizing antibody activity detection, and the evaluation of vaccine effects [3, 9] .",

The present study used a lentiviral packaging system and recombinant expression plasmids encoding RVFV structural proteins to construct RVFV pseudoviruses. The electron microscopy observations and western blotting results all indicated the successful construction of RVFV pseudoviruses. Additionally, the infective activity of the obtained RVFV pseudoviruses was inhibited by specific antibodies, indicating that the pseudoviruses could be used to detect RVFV-neutralizing antibody titers. Moreover, the RVFV pseudovirus neutralization assay established in this study effectively evaluated antibody titers in positive mouse serum. The pseudovirus packaging experiment showed that the passage time and status of the 293T cells and the transfection reagents, plasmid purity, gene features of the structural proteins, and efficiency of the eukaryotic expression plasmids all greatly influenced the pseudovirus packaging efficiency and affected the titer levels and stability of the packaged pseudoviruses. Therefore, the pseudovirus neutralization assay established in the present study can be used for clinical monitoring and diagnosis of RVFV infection and for assessment of the effects of RVFV vaccines. Furthermore, the pseudovirus can be used to replace the natural virus in infection mechanism studies. However, the packaging conditions should be optimized to increase the lentiviral packaging efficiency and infection titers.",
