Most current multivariate CAR models are designed for each multivariate outcome to utilize the same lattice structure. In many applications, a change of basis will allow different lattices to be utilized, but this is not always the case, because a change of basis is not always desirable or even possible. Our multivariate CAR model allows each outcome to have a different neighborhood structure which can utilize different lattices for each structure. The model is applied in two real data analysis. The first is a Bayesian learning example in mapping the 2006 Iowa Mumps epidemic, which demonstrates the importance of utilizing multiple channels of infection flow in mapping infectious diseases. The second is a multivariate analysis of poverty levels and educational attainment in the American Community Survey.",

Additional work has been done by Sain and Cressie (2002) , Gelfand and Vounatsou (2003) and Jin et al. (2005) . A common theme among these models is that they utilize the same neighborhood structure for each of the multivariate outcomes. The model of Hossain et al. (2014) is of particular interest. It is a very general model based on the conditioning that contains many of the common multivariate CAR models in the literature as special cases. The model can be applied to data sets with more than two outcomes, but this is not demonstrated. Working directly with differing neighborhood structures is possible in their framework, but we do not know of applications of this model to differing neighborhood structures in the literature, potentially because the conditional structure makes interpretation of these results difficult.",

We prefer this model structure for modeling outcomes with respect to different neighborhood structures, as it allows asymmetric weighting between outcomes, which is one of the advantages of univariate CAR models. The application they utilize assumes the same lattice for every neighborhood structure, but the general full conditional mean structure they consider can be extended to mismatched lattices. Additionally, their formulation induces the potentially restrictive requirement that the variances of each outcome with a fixed lattice point differ by a known and fixed proportion. For many analyses, this constraint is reasonable. Expected counts or inverse weightings of the number of neighbors are often available and can be used in this regard. However, we will provide evidence that the variances are one of the most important features in this model, and we provide an extension of the model allowing the variances to be more flexibly estimated than is considered in their analyses.",

While a change of support is often possible for mismatched lattices, this technique is not always desirable, and is occasionally impossible, as in the case where measurements do not make sense over certain regions of an areal unit. In order to analyze mismatched lattices, we will relax the variance restrictions in Sain et al. (2011) 's formulation of the model.

As Iowa is predominantly rural, a standard CAR model which utilizes geographic borders to determine adjacency could be used to relate neighboring counties in the infectious disease process. However, it is clear from the data that cases of Mumps tended to spread along the highway system. This is an example of how multiple modes of travel and contact can spread an infectious agent. In a relatively rural state like Iowa, highway systems may serve as an important measure of adjacency for infectious disease spread, just as airline travel may be an important measure of adjancency in pandemic modeling on a larger geographical scale (e.g., Hufnagel et al., 2004) .",

One of the reasons is likely that many infectious diseases are spread via human to human transmission, and the geographical proximity of two locations may not be an accurate assessment of the overall proximity of the locations in terms of disease spread. This makes a reasonable neighborhood structure difficult to construct. In the modern world, proximity is often defined by travel, rather than geographical measures. Hufnagel et al. (2004) showed that airline travel served as an accurate measure of proximity in the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic of 2003. In general, it is likely that modern epidemics are spread via more than one causeway. For many epidemics, a realistic model may have to account for multiple modes of travel.",

In the case where d k\u00fei\u00fe is positive, the division by 1 \u00c0 d k\u00fei\u00fe implies that a fraction of the outcome's own neighborhood structure will be used in determining the outcome's mean.

These highways are only considered as part of the structure when they are multilane divided highways, as those stretches contain the most traffic. When two highways intersect, the longer highway is broken into two highway segments, with the argument being that shorter stretches of highways are more likely to be accurately modeled with the same random effect, and allows an analysis of which stretches of highway carried the highest risk of infection. It will also allow for differences in risk to be associated with interstates versus state routes, which often carry different types of traffic. This structure then consists of every multilane highway in Iowa that passes through more than two counties, yielding a highway lattice consisting of 12 stretches of highway that pass through 53 counties. The structure in this example is mismatched in two ways. First, there are 46 counties which do not have a multilane highway, and these counties are deleted from the highway lattice structure entirely. Second, Each stretch of highway is associated with two or more counties. This implies that a single highway random effect will be associated with multiple counties in our model.

The prior on d is Uniform(\u00c02,0.125), where 0.125 is selected to yield the full positive support of d given the model structure. This support follows because we assume that d is constant in its relationship from county to highway coupled with the fact that the model requires P l P lj'ki d klij < 1 and the longest stretch of highway covers eight counties. Therefore, for at least one stretch of highway, d P 1=8 will violate the assumption P l P lj'ki d klij < 1.

From the data, it is suspected that there are two latent spatial structures at work. Thinking of Mumps in terms of physical transfer, certainly Mumps can travel from county to county across borders. However, the data demonstrate longer range dependence when graphed over time. The MMCAR model can be used to test the importance of hypothesized channels of spread before undertaking the building of more complex and computationally expensive infectious disease models. Because the lattices here are mismatched, there will be multiple counties associated with each highway random effect. In this way there is sufficient information to distinguish between the two structures, and so this modeling framework will take advantage of both lattice structures.",

A burn-in period of 50,000 samples was discarded and then 350,000 samples were collected from Model One. A burn-in period of 50,000 iterations was also used for Model Two, with 250,000 iterations being collected after burn-in for analysis. Model Three required a burn-in of 250,000 iterations and 550,000 iterations were collected from the converged chains. Model Four required a 300,000 iteration burn in period and then 900,000 iterations were selected from the converged chain. The differences in the lengths of the chains are due to differences in model complexity. Convergence was assessed via the Geweke diagnostic (Geweke, 1992) , with p-values greater than 0.05 considered indicating convergence for the risk surface and variance parameters, which are the quantities of interest for inference. As is common in CAR modeling, mixing was slow between the model intercept and the mean of the random effects (Rue and Held, 2005) . However, we do not wish to draw inference on these quantities, and all quantities of interest pass convergence diagnostics. Table 1 provides parameter posteriors for all model parameters. We see that the means and variances are very similar for Models One and Three, with the propriety parameter being lower for model Three. Model Four provides similar means, but higher latent effect variances. The propriety parameters of Model Three are more akin to those of Model One. Fig. 2 provides posterior densities for the MMCAR model and illuminates the issue of the estimation of the propriety parameter. The model suggests an independence of the highway and border effects.",

This indicates that the model is able to determine the importance of both channels of infection in mapping the spread of Mumps. Additionally, it lends credence to the idea of using the MMCAR here, despite having only one outcome informing two sets of latent effects. However, the DIC of Model Four is lower than that of Model Three, the MMCAR model. This is may be due to independence in the highway and border structures. It is worth noting that previous work has demonstrated that DIC does not always select the best model in terms of risk surface prediction when performing disease mapping (e.g., Best et al., 2005; Hossain et al., 2014 ).

The demographic information contained within the survey is often useful in disease mapping, and an analysis of these data will show the broad applicability of the MMCAR model. We demonstrate the ability of this model to detect multiple cross correlation parameters by performing a multivariate analysis of poverty and educational attainment in the Midwest. Specifically, we are interested in accurately modeling the percent of families in poverty at the county-level and the percent of individuals 25 and older who do not have a high school education or equivalent in North Dakota, South Dakota, Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, Minnesota, Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Michigan.

Notably, d is concentrated near the maximum of its range, indicating strong between-lattice association.

To reduce variability in the parameter posteriors, we have provided a recommended parameterization and sampling scheme for our model. This model will prove useful in modeling infectious disease counts, especially in cases where there are multiple modes of travel or contact. The model is computationally less expensive than spatial SIR models, and so it can be used to test the significance of different channels of disease spread before their inclusion in more complex models. We have demonstrated a highway effect in the disease counts of the Iowa epidemic, and suggest this reiterates the importance of considering multiple contact pathways when modeling infectious diseases.
