Apparent farm seroprevalence rates for PPV, PCV2 and Lawsonia intracellularis were 56.3% (95% CI, 39-73%), 21.9% (95% CI, 8-36%) and 78.1% (95% CI, 64-92%), respectively. No antibodies were detected against SIV, ADV, CSFV, SVDV, TGEV, PRSSV, Leptospira spp., Brucella spp., or M. hyopneumoniae. Increasing herd size, proximity to dense populations of domestic swine and later sampling times within the survey period were found to be risk factors. Overall, the seroprevalence of these pathogens in farmed wild boar was similar to that in the farmed domestic pig population in Finland. However, it is possible that the rearing of wild boars in fenced estates may predispose them to particular infections, as reflected in higher antibody titres.",

Every farm was contacted by mail and non-respondents (n = 25) received a phone call from a member of the research group. Ultimately, a response was obtained from 104 farmers: 33 indicated that they no longer farmed wild boar, 39 did not wish to participate, and 32 volunteered to take part. All farms used a similar production system. The boars were kept in fenced enclosures and were fed regularly at specific feeding sites. Outside breeding and farrowing periods, the females and young were kept in one or sometimes two separate areas. Adult boars were most commonly held in a separate, smaller enclosure. During the breeding season in late autumn/early winter, selected boars were housed with the adult sows. There was some variation in sow management during the farrowing season. The majority of farms divided late-gestation sows into smaller groups of animals familiar to each other. However, this approach was not practiced particularly in Southern Finland where animal numbers were larger. Piglets/ young animals were generally housed initially with their dam, and then with other adult sows and their offspring until time of slaughter. Two farms in Eastern Finland specialised in growing/finishing animals (slaughter type farm). Vaccination was not practiced on any of the farms.",

For the L. intracellularis model, these variables were 'surface area of enclosure', 'animal density', 'herd size', 'animal age' and 'gender' and 'year of sampling'. After fitting the initial model, a backward stepwise elimination model building technique was used. The significance of each variable was evaluated against the exclusion criteria (likelihood ratio test, P < 0.2). The terms of interaction between the significant variables were entered into the model. None of these was found to be significant and were thus excluded from the final model. The possibility of confounding variables was considered, but was judged to be non-existent among the known variables.",

Our seroprevalence data for PPV and PCV2 are at the higher end of previously reported results for these pathogens. Vicente et al.
