These findings suggest that RV1B stimulates an early immune response that clears PR8 28 while limiting excessive pulmonary inflammation. The timing of RV1B co-infection was a 29 critical determinant of protection, suggesting that sufficient time is needed to induce this 30 response. Finally, disease attenuation was not unique to RV1B: co-infection by a murine 31 coronavirus two days before PR8 also reduced disease severity. This model will be critical for Co-infection by RV leads to more rapid clearance of PR8 from the lungs 146 The above experiments established that RV effectively attenuated disease due to a mild 147 PR8 infection. We next asked whether the reduced virulence during co-infection was due to 148 inhibition of PR8 replication within the lungs. Groups of mice were either mock-inoculated or 149 inoculated with RV two days before inoculating with a low dose of PR8 (Mock/PR8, RV/PR8). 150 Groups of mice were euthanized on days 4, 7, and 10 after PR8 inoculation and lungs were 151 harvested for PR8 quantification. On day 4 after PR8 inoculation, the viral loads in single virus 152 and co-infected mice were not significantly different, but co-infected mice had greater variation 153 within the group (Fig. 2) . However, on day 7, the Mock/PR8-infected mice still had PR8 titers in 154 the 10 4 -10 5 range, whereas the RV/PR8-co-infected mice had undetectable levels of PR8. By day 155 10, both groups had undetectable levels of infectious PR8. This suggests that co-infection with 156 RV did not prevent infection or inhibit early replication of PR8, but induced more rapid 157 clearance of PR8 from the lungs. 158 We also evaluated lung sections for PR8 antigens by immunohistochemistry. The lack of 159 PR8 antigen staining in lung sections from mock-inoculated mice confirmed the specificity of 178 Next, we used a murine lung epithelial cell line (LA-4) that is susceptible to infection by 179 both viruses (30) to determine if co-infection by RV would interfere with PR8 replication in vitro. 180 LA-4 cells were inoculated with RV 6 or 12 hours before or simultaneously with PR8. PR8 181 released into the media was quantified by TCID 50 assay in MDCK cells. We confirmed that the 182 presence of RV in these samples did not interfere with quantification of PR8 in MDCK cells (not 183 shown). There were no significant differences at any time point between cells inoculated with 9 hours before PR8 (Fig. 4B) . The lower PR8 titers at 96 hours may have been due to higher cell 187 death from two viruses being present, providing fewer susceptible cells for PR8 replication.",

By day 4, lung pathology was more extensive in RV/PR8 co-210 infected mice than Mock/PR8-infected mice. However, by days 7 and 10, mice infected with 211 Mock/PR8 had more severe lung pathology than RV/PR8 co-infected mice. Overall, necrosis and 212 desquamation in the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli were more severe in Mock/PR8 213 than in RV/PR8 co-infected mice. Furthermore, excessive mucopurulent material consisting of Co-infection by RV was effective at reducing disease during a mild or moderate PR8 236 infection when given two days before PR8. We next determined whether co-infection with RV 237 simultaneously with or two days after a low or medium dose of PR8 would also ameliorate 238 disease. When RV and PR8 Low were inoculated simultaneously (RV+PR8 Low ), co-infection 239 resulted in a disease phenotype intermediate between PR8 Low alone (Mock/PR8 Low ) and RV two 240 days before PR8 Low (RV/PR8 Low ) ( Fig. 6A-C) . RV+PR8 Low co-infected mice reached 33% 241 mortality by day 9 (Fig. 6A ). This mortality was higher than mice inoculated with RV two days 242 before PR8 Low (RV/PR8 Low ), but significantly lower than the 100% mortality seen with mice 243 infected with PR8 Low alone (Mock/PR8 Low ). RV+PR8 Low -infected mice lost weight at a similar 244 rate to Mock/PR8 Low -infected mice, beginning on day 3 and continuing until day 8 before 245 recovering (Fig. 6B ). Average clinical scores were also similar between simultaneous co-246 infection and single infection, with slight lethargy, hunching, breathing, and moderate ruffling 247 detected on day 3 and 4 and peaking with moderate lethargy, hunching, breathing, and severe 248 ruffling on day 7 before co-infected mice (RV+PR8 Low ) began recovering from infection ( Fig.   249 6C). Interestingly, when RV was given two days after PR8 Low (PR8 Low /RV), co-infection 250 exacerbated PR8 disease, as evidenced by more rapid mortality, weight loss, and higher clinical 251 scores than mice infected with Mock/PR8 Low (Fig. 6A-C) . PR8 Low /RV co-infected mice began 252 dying and reached 100% mortality two days before mice inoculated with Mock/PR8 Low (Fig. 6B ).",

RV was less effective at 321 disease attenuation when mice were given higher doses of PR8, or RV was given at the same 322 time as PR8. Further, mice given RV two days after PR8 had enhanced disease compared to PR8 323 alone. We also found that disease attenuation was not limited to co-infection by RV. A 324 respiratory tropic strain of MHV also reduced PR8 disease when given two days before PR8. with RV two days before PR8 did not reduce PR8 levels in the lungs early in infection (Fig. 2) or 331 prevent spread of PR8 within the respiratory tract (Fig. 3) . These findings suggest that RV does 332 not directly inhibit infection by PR8, which was also confirmed by our in vitro studies (Fig. 4) .",

This could be an indirect consequence of early viral clearance (Fig. 2) This study demonstrated that RV-mediated disease attenuation was less effective as we 383 increased the dose of PR8, shortened the timing between virus inoculations, or gave RV after 384 PR8 (Figs. 1 and 6 ). These differences are likely due to the kinetics and magnitudes of RV-and that exacerbate disease when RV is given 2 days after PR8. It is possible that these are the same 393 mechanisms that reduce disease when RV is given 2 days before PR8 and that the timing of their 394 induction is key to regulating pathogenesis.

MHV-infected 278 mice (MHV 2000 /Mock) had rapid, early weight loss followed by gradual recovery of weight (Fig. 2797B). These mice had moderate ruffling and hunching early in infection, which reduced to slight 280 ruffling, lethargy, and hunching before finally recovering on day 13(Fig. 7C). Despite the 281 prolonged morbidity in MHV-infected mice, mice co-infected with a lethal dose of PR8282 (MHV 2000 /PR8) had similar mortality and morbidity as those infected by MHV alone (Fig. 7A-C). 283 MHV 2000 /PR8 co-infected mice regained weight at a slower rate than mice inoculated with 284 MHV 2000 /Mock, but eventually reached the same weight (Fig. 7B). Thus, co-infection by MHV 285 reduced the severity of PR8-induced disease, but this dose of MHV caused significant morbidity 286 in BALB/c mice. 287 To determine whether infection by a lower dose of MHV would cause less disease but 288 still provide protection against PR8, we tested two additional doses of MHV: 1x10 3 PFU 289 (MHV 1000 ) and 2x10 2 PFU (MHV 200 ). When mice were inoculated with the 2-fold lower dose of 290 MHV (MHV 1000 /Mock), there was no mortality associated with infection (Fig. 7D). These mice 291 lost weight very early in infection, but did not lose as much weight as those infected by the 292 higher dose (Fig. 7E vs. B). MHV 1000 /Mock-infected mice had minor ruffling and hunching on 293day 0, which continued until day 9(Fig. 7F). When MHV was inoculated two days before PR8 294 (MHV 1000 /PR8), only one mouse reached a humane endpoint, and mortality was delayed until 295 day 8, compared to day 5 for the higher dose of MHV(Fig. 7D vs. A). Similar to mice infected 296 by MHV 1000 alone, MHV 1000 /PR8 co-infected mice lost weight early. However, co-infected mice 297 had delayed recovery of weight and their weight was still lower than MHV 1000 -infected mice at of the study(Fig. 7E), which corresponded with prolonged clinical signs of disease(Fig. 2997F). Although this lower dose of MHV caused a milder infection and provided similar protection 300 against PR8-mediated mortality, morbidity was prolonged in the co-infected mice suggesting it 301 was less effective than the higher dose.302 When mice were inoculated with a 10-fold lower dose of MHV (MHV 200 /Mock), they all 303 survived and had minimal weight loss and clinical signs of disease, which was limited to slight 304 ruffling (Fig. 7G-I). However, mice that were co-infected with this low dose of MHV prior to 305 PR8 (MHV 200 /PR8) had significant mortality, weight loss, and prolonged clinical signs of 306 disease, including moderate lethargy and labored breathing (Fig. 6G-I). Even though this lowest 307 dose of MHV caused minimal disease in BALB/c mice, it did not protect mice against PR8-308 induced morbidity and mortality. These data suggest that a dose of MHV that causes significant 309 morbidity is required to effectively protect against a lethal dose of PR8. Although both RV and 310 MHV given two days earlier both reduced the severity of PR8, they vary in pathogenesis and have suggested that respiratory viral co-infections may alter pathogenesis 315 compared to infection by the viruses individually. RV has been implicated in both interfering 316 with the spread of influenza viruses and reducing the severity of influenza during co-infection (8, 317 9, 19-22).

In addition 340 to promoting cell-intrinsic antiviral defense strategies, type I IFNs are important for the 341 recruitment and functional phenotypes of myeloid cell responses to influenza virus infections (34, 342 35).

On day 4 after PR8 infection, 351 co-infected animals had multiple foci of inflammation throughout the lungs. In contrast, animals 352 infected with PR8 alone had reduced recruitment of inflammatory cells. This early immune 353 response may lead to earlier clearance of PR8 from co-infected lungs, as we saw by day 7 (Fig. 354 2). Although it is not virulent in mice, RV (strain 1B) induces an inflammatory response in the 355 respiratory tracts of BALB/c and C57Bl/6 mice. The response to RV includes recruitment of 356 neutrophils and lymphocytes, concurrent with production of antiviral cytokines and chemokines. 357 Neutrophil levels in the airways of RV-infected mice peak on days 1 and 2 and decline by day 4, 358 while lymphocytes are present through day 7 (27, 32, 33, 36, 37). Studies differ in whether 359 macrophage numbers change significantly upon RV infection in mice (27, 32, 33, 36). Type I 360 and III interferons, proinflammatory cytokines, and neutrophil and lymphocyte recruiting 361 chemokines are also up-regulated in response to RV infection in mice (27, 32, 33). These cellular 362 and cytokine responses are not stimulated by UV-inactivated virus, suggesting that viral 363 replication is required (27, 33).

Our histopathology data are in 373 agreement with studies that demonstrate excessive inflammatory responses occurring as viral 374 loads are decreasing (23, 41). We inoculated mice with PR8 two days after RV inoculation, 375 which is just prior to the decline in neutrophil numbers in the lungs of RV-infected BALB/c mice 376 (27). Furthermore, RV infection actively down-regulates neutrophil responses by inhibiting TLR 377 signaling and thereby reducing expression of neutrophil-specific chemokines upon co-infection 378 by a bacterial pathogen (42). The inflamed areas of the RV/PR8 co-infected lungs contained 379 fewer neutrophils than mock/PR8-infected lungs. Neutrophils are known to contribute to 380 immune-mediated damage during PR8 infection (43, 44).

Unlike RV, MHV causes morbidity and mortality in mice, though virulence is mouse 397 strain-dependent (28, 29, 48). We have observed dose-dependent severity of MHV in BALB/c 398 mice. Intranasal inoculation of 2 x 10 3 PFU resulted in clinical disease with low mortality (Fig. 399 7), while a dose of 2 x 10 5 caused 100% mortality (data not shown). Survival of BALB/c mice 400 upon MHV-1 infection is dependent upon a type I IFN response (49). Furthermore, mouse strain-401 dependent resistance to MHV-1 disease corresponds with robust expression of type I IFNs (28). 402 Based on these studies, we expect that the type I IFN response is adequate to protect BALB/c 403 from a lower dose, but not a lethal dose, of MHV. Other components of the BALB/c immune 404 response to MHV-1 infection have not been studied in detail. A complete understanding of this 405 response will be important in determining the similarities and differences in the mechanisms 406 whereby MHV and RV reduce the severity of PR8. 407 Although our viral inoculations were all within two days of each other, other studies have 408 shown that infection of mice by one virus can alter the immune response to a heterologous virus 409 given after resolution of the initial infection (50). Mice given lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus 410 (LCMV), murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), or PR8 six weeks prior to vaccinia virus had of vaccinia virus compared to control mice. However, infection with PR8 six 412 weeks prior to LCMV or MCMV increased titers of the second virus. Protection was associated 413 with changing from a response dominated by neutrophils to lymphocytes or a Th2 response to a 414 Th1 response. In contrast, when pigs were infected with porcine reproductive and respiratory 415 syndrome virus they had increased severity of porcine respiratory coronavirus infection, which 416 corresponded with an increased Th1 cytokine response and reduced NK cell and type I IFN 417 responses (51). Characterizing the immune responses across our various co-infection pairs and 418 infection timings will provide insight into how different viruses mediate heterologous immunity 419 and if these mechanisms are generalizable.",
