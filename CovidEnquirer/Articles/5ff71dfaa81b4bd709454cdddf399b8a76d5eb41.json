In this work, we reported a novel quinoxaline derivative, 2,3-di(furan-2-yl)-6-(3-N,N-diethylcarbamoyl-piperidino)carbonylamino quinoxaline (DC838, 3), which was confirmed to be a potent inhibitor against human CypA. By using the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and fluorescence titration techniques, the kinetic analysis of CypA/DC838 interaction was quantitatively performed. CypA peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity inhibition assay showed that DC838 demonstrated highly CypA PPIase inhibitory activity. In vivo assay results showed that DC838 could inhibit mouse spleen cell proliferation induced by concanavalin A (Con A). Molecular docking simulation further elucidated the specific DC838 binding to CypA at the atomic level. The current work should provide useful information in the discovery of immunosuppressor based on CypA inhibitor.",

Like other immunophilins, CypA has a high binding affinity to the immunosuppressor cyclosporin A (CsA), and CsA inhibits peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity of CypA. 3, 4 CypA is widely distributed in various tissues, and expressed in highest concentration in the brain. 5 This makes it important in the maturation and folding of neuron-specific proteins in vivo, even though the details of its functional mechanisms are largely unknown. It is reported that CsA can regulate the level of CypA in both undifferentiated and cAMP-induced differentiated murine neuroblastoma (NB) cells in culture. 6 When treated with CsA, the NB cell can partially differentiate into neurons, which implicates a role for CypA in neuronal differentiation. 6 Therefore, CypA ligands might hold great potential for the treatment of nerve injuries and neurological disease.",

            "text": "CsA is a natural fungal cyclic undecapeptide metabolite and has been used as an immunosuppressant drug for the prevention of organ rejection after transplant operations. 7 The CsA-induced immunosuppression has been tentatively explained and related to CypA. It is believed that the immunosuppressive action is exercised by the ternary complexes, namely the CsA/CypA complex inhibits the calcineurin (CN) activity, which plays a key role in the signal transduction pathway towards the T-cell activation. Inhibition of CN might prevent dephosphorylation of the cytosolic component of the transcription factor, nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT), and prevent its movement into the nucleus where it is critical for the production of immunosignalling cytokines, including interleukin 2, thus leading to the suppression of T-cell activation. [8] [9] [10] [11] CypA is also required for the infectious activity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] The gag of HIV is a polyprotein and cleaved by proteases into several functional proteins: matrix (MA), capsid (CA), nucleocapsid (NC), and small peptides. 18, 19 The HIV CA protein is essential for the assembly and infectivity of HIV virions. 16, 18, 20, 21 CypA binds directly to the CA domain of gag, with a CA-CypA stoichiometry of approximately 10:1 per virion. 13, 14, 22, 23 Formation of the CA-CypA complex is competitively inhibited by molecules that bind to the active site of CypA, including CsA and its nonimmunosuppressive analogue SDZ NIM 811. 12, 24 This complex formation can also be inhibited by a series of mutations at the N-terminus of CA. Reagents and mutations that inhibit the CA/CypA interaction in vitro also block CypA packaging and HIV-1 replication in culture, demonstrating that this interaction is essential for viral infectivity. [13] [14] [15] 25 Recently, we found that the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV binds to human CypA with high affinity, and the equilibrium dissociation (K D ) is 100-2700 times higher than the binding affinity of HIV-1 CA to CypA. 26 Sequence alignment and molecular modeling revealed that SARS-CoV N loop Trp302-Pro310 fits into the active site groove of CypA through hydrogen bonding, cation-p and -CH\u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1p hydrogen bonding interactions. This observed SARS-CoV N/CypA interaction might provide a new hint for the understanding of a possible SARS-CoV infection pathway against human cell, and further supply a feasible approach for anti-SARS agent screening.",

Therefore, we investigated the binding affinity of compound DC838 against CypA by using the published intrinsic fluorescence titration technique. 31 During the assay, a 1:1 stoichiometry of CypA/compound binding was performed according to the published result for CypA/CsA interaction. 32, 33 The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (K 0 D ) for CypA/DC838 binding was thus calculated according to the literature method. 31 It is assumed that 50% occupancy of CypA is set at a fractional fluorescence change of 0.5 (FC 0.5 ), then at this point the concentration of the bound ligand equals to the bound protein, the half of the total concentration of protein. Accordingly, K 0 D is equal to the total ligand concentration at FC 0.5 minus the concentration of the bound protein. 31 Figure 2 shows the typical tryptophan fluorescence quenching of CypA induced by the titration of DC838 with an increasing concentration. Since compound DC838 itself does not show any intrinsic fluorescence absorption, its possible effect on the experiments could be neglected. Obviously, the evaluated K 0 D value at 3.78 lM is compatible to the K D value by Biacore 3000. Moreover, as indicated in Figure 2 and Table 2 , the fact that DC838 can perturb CsA binding to CypA during the competition assay by shifting the K 0 D to 10.05 lM for CypA binding to CsA implicates that both DC838 and CsA bind to CypA in the same binding pocket. This is in agreement with the molecular docking analysis result of this work, as will be discussed blow.",

During the assay, the rate constants for the cis-trans interconversion were evaluated by fitting the data to the integrated first-order rate equation through nonlinear least-square analysis. 34, 35 CsA was tested as a positive control for assay assessment, in which the IC 50 of CsA against CypA was figured out as 61.4 nM (Fig. 3) , which is in agreement with the previous result. The inhibition result for the compound DC838 against CypA PPIase activity in a series of concentrations was demonstrated in Figure 3 , the IC 50 value was thus determined as 0.41 lM, which is comparable with the Biacore and fluorescence titration analytical results (Tables 1  and 2 ). These results thereby further imply the reliability of these three detection approaches.",

The shape-scoring function is an empirical function resembling the van der Waals' attractive energy. The ligand/receptor binding energy is taken to be approximately the sum of the van der Waals' and electrostatic interaction energies. After the initial orientation and scoring evaluation, a grid-based rigid body minimization was carried out for the ligand to locate the nearest local energy minimum within the receptor binding site. The position and conformation of each docked molecule were optimized using the single anchor search and torsion minimization method of DOCK 4.0. Thirty conformations per ligand building a cycle and 50 maximum anchor orientations were used in the anchorfirst docking algorithm. All docked configurations were energy minimized using 100 maximum iterations and one minimization cycle.",
