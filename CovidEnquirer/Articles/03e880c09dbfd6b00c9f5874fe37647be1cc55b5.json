Such antibody has been shown to protect chicks against IBV challenge for 4 weeks depending on the methods used for challenge and subsequent evaluation of protection (Darbyshire and Peters, 1985; Mockett et al., 1987) . Vaccination of 1-day-old commercial broiler chickens against IBV is widely performed. This practice raises two important concerns: (1) in\u00afuence of maternal antibody (Mab) on the development of active immune response to the vaccine, and (2) effect of vaccine virus on the rate of depletion of Mab. Another basic concern is whether neonatal administration of IBV to chicks via spray or drinking water could induce an immunologic tolerance to one or more IBV antigens. The latter is a logical concern based on studies conducted in mammalian species where tolerance has been demonstrated to mucosally administered antigens (McGhee et al., 1992; van Wilsem et al., 1995; Galliaerde et al., 1995; Lamm, 1997; Weiner, 1997) . In the present study, day-old vaccination did not induce``tolerance'' to IBV, nevertheless, it was found to: (a) hasten depletion of Mab, and (b) interfere with antibody responses to both primary and secondary immunizations.",

The respiratory system of each bird was\u00afushed three times with a total of 10 ml of warm (378C) PBS, and the three washes from each bird were pooled. Respiratory lavage\u00afuids in Experiments 2 and 3 were collected as described by Mockett et al. (1987) with slight modi\u00aecation. In this case, tracheal segments were washed between a point immediately distal to the rima glottis and immediately proximal to the point where the trachea enters the thoracic cavity. Using a micropipett with disposable tips, 0.8 ml of PBS was used t\u014d ush the trachea three times with the same\u00afuid.

Fig. 1 summarizes results of antibody measurement by I-ELISA against whole virus antigen and those of IBV challenge studies. At hatching, Mab chicks had signi\u00aecant levels of antibody in serum and the respiratory tract, as represented by the logarithm (log 10 ) of geometric means, 5.2 log and 2.7 log, respectively. When challenged with IBV through the intraocular route at 1 day of age, these chicks had excellent protection with only 1 of 19 chicks yielding the challenge virus (>95% protection) 4 days post-challenge. At 7 days of age, while no remarkable change was observed in serum antibody titer, that in the respiratory system had dropped to approximately half (1.5 log) of the level recorded at day 1. This coincided with a drastic drop (<30%) in protection to virus challenge at day 7. During the remaining period (10\u00b117 days), the serum-antibody levels declined gradually, remaining at an appreciable level until day 17 (>3.0 log), whereas, respiratory antibody levels fell below 1.0 log during the same period. There was no protection to IBV challenge on days 14 and 17. One hundred percent of the Mab\u00c0 control chickens yielded virus at 4 days post-challenge at each of the 5 periods (data not shown). the 18 vaccinated chickens and 1 of the 10 unvaccinated chickens had no detectable serum antibody. Nevertheless, the mean serum antibody levels of the two groups did not differ signi\u00aecantly (P > 0:05) at day 7. However, at days 14 and 21, such differences became highly signi\u00aecant (P < 0:01) as the majority of vaccinated birds (16/18 and 15/ 18, at 14 and 21 days, respectively) had no detectable serum antibody as compared to only 3/10 and 1/10 unvaccinated chickens at the respective days.
