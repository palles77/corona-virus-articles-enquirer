A very similar linear growth of the epidemic can be observed, at the early stage of the epidemic in Japan and Wuhan, China. We suspect that there might also be similarities in future trend. Therefore, we forecast that the situation in Japan is hardly optimistic, if the current isolation rate of Wuhan is used for Japan.

In (4), the authors estimated the probability of transportation of COVID-19 from Wuhan to 369 cities in China before the quarantine of Wuhan and concluded that the expected risk is greater than 50% in 130 (95% CI 89-190) cities and is even greater than 99% in the 4 largest metropolitan areas of China. In (5) , the authors studied the feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts. Their results suggest that it is very difficult to control the trends of infection under a high value of R 0 and when a large initial number of cases has appeared even if less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset. Similarly, (1, 6) also suggested proper transmissibility reduction to avoid the outbreak of epidemic. Case numbers are rising exponentially in multiple cities due to human-to-human transmission. To possibly secure containment of the spread of infection, substantial public health interventions should be considered and carried out immediately. Multiple provinces including Hubei have adopted measures such as metropolitan-wide quarantine and reduction of inter-city mobility. Besides, it is crucial to isolate patients, trace and quarantine all possible contacts as the earliest stage because of the possibility of asymptomatic infections (7) .",

As can be seen from the sub-figure A in Figure 6 , if \u2113 2 = \u2113 1 , the epidemic will continue to grow, while if \u2113 2 < \u2113 1 , the epidemic in all nine areas will slow down. We can clearly see that the nine areas can be divided into three groups based on number of confirmed cases. For Beijing and Shanghai, they are the first to take effective quarantine measures, and receive the best control effects. The second group consists of Hunan, Zhejiang, Henan and Shangdong, of which the isolation rate is lower and thus have a fast confirm rate. Specially, in a later stage, Hunan started taking strong quarantine measures and received better control effects, compared to the rest three areas in this group. Lastly, the third group is made up of China (without Hubei), Hubei (without Wuhan) and Wuhan, which were the last to take quarantine measures. In particular, the average administrative strength of China (without Hubei) is stronger than that of Hubei (without Wuhan). Therefore, the average final control effects in China (without Hubei) is better than that of Hubei (without Wuhan).",

When \u2113 2 = \u2113 1 or \u2113 2 = 0.35 , namely when the quarantine strategy taken is not effective enough, the infected/confirmed number will grow exponentially.
