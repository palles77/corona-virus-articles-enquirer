The spotted hyena is the most commonly encountered species in the wild; aardwolves, and striped hyenas, and brown hyenas are rarely encountered because of their smaller size, nocturnal habits, and solitary nature. Hyenas as a group communicate through vocalizations, body posture, and scent marking, the last of which is highly developed in the brown hyena and consists of two components, which dry to different colors and consistency on prominent vegetation (Figure 51-1) .",

They live in small clans composed of several females, males, and offspring. Clans are rather female bonded, and females are believed to be related (Wiesel, personal communication) . Nomadic males are believed to maintain genetic diversity by ranging across clan territories. Males and females are morphologically similar. All clan members participate in communal raising of offspring. Although they are predominantly scavengers, brown hyenas actively hunt and consume Cape fur seal pups (Arctocephalus pusillus) along the Namibian coast. 24 In more arid areas, brown hyenas also consume plant material such as Tsama (Citrullus lanatus) and gemsbok cucumbers (Acathosicyos naudinianus). 15 Diamond mining, vehicular trauma, and human encroachment threaten existing populations of the brown hyena. Estimates of population size range from 5000 to 8000 in the wild and an estimated 800 to 1000 individuals in Namibia.

Underground burrows are frequently used for raising cubs or providing shelter during daylight hours. Territorial boundaries are marked, as in other hyenas, through anal gland secretions placed on prominent vegetation. Scent marked areas increase in density around dens and latrines. Aardwolves prefer open dry areas with short grass, especially overgrazed farmland. 5 Population estimates are not available, but aardwolves are widely distributed and are thought to be common, but rarely seen animals.

The relatively weak hindlimbs sustain long distance loping, which is advantageous when hunting faster, but less so when hunting prey with endurance or distance scavenging. The jaws of the brown, spotted, and striped hyenas are very powerful, able to crush most long bones of large prey items. The brown hyena is also able to break ostrich (Struthio camelus) eggs, whereas the spotted hyena cannot. 1 The dental formula of the hyenas is: incisors (I) 3/3, canines (C) 1/1, premolars (P) 4/3, and molars (M) 1/1, 17 whereas that of the aardwolf which is uniquely adapted to an insect diet, is: I 3/3, C1/1, P 3/2-1 and M 1/1-2. 13 All hyenas have four digits on the forelimbs and hindlimbs, with the exception of the aardwolf, which has five digits on the forelimbs and four on the hindlimbs. The pelage is a mix of spots, stripes, and muted shades of brown and black; long and shaggy in the aardwolf, brown ( Figure 51 -2), and striped hyenas and short and sparse in the spotted hyena ( Figure 51 -3). Scent marking is the most important form of communication among hyenas. The anal glands are highly developed and large in each species and secrete a pheromone-laced sebaceous paste on prominent vegetation. Scent marking is used to define territories, signal potential mates, and identify conspecific and contraspecific individuals. 5, 17 REPRODUCTION Hyena reproduction relies on complex social structures. 5, 17 Specific reproductive data are provided in Table 51 -2. 7 Dystocia has been documented in captive spotted hyenas, all of which were surgically corrected. 4 Other reproductive tract abnormalities are not reported in the literature but likely are similar to the problems in domestic dogs and cats.",

The brown hyena is a nocturnal, silent, solitary forager. 15 However, large carcasses attract several hyenas. As opposed to the spotted hyena, brown hyenas generally feed singly, rather than in groups, even on larger carcasses. Individuals wait in the distance until the conspecific finishes (Wiesel, personal communication). In most instances, black-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas) arrive at the bait first; vocalization of larger groups of jackals may attract hyenas to the site. Jackals will commonly signal a hyena' s approach by nervously looking in the direction of the hyena. Camouflage, a low-profile silhouette, and absolute stillness are required for success of immobilization of hyenas. Use of advanced lighting, in the form of infrared technology, facilitates darting. Commercially available remote delivery systems work well, and dart placement is paramount to success. A well-placed dart in the neck or shoulder affords consistent success. A combination of ketamine (2-3 milligrams per kilogram [mg/kg]) with medetomidine (0.035-0.045 mg/kg) is effective within 3 minutes and causes recumbency of the animal within 7 minutes on average. 22 This combination provides rapid smooth induction, good muscle relaxation, stable heart rate and rhythm, slight to moderate pytalism, and 40 to 50 minutes of stable anesthesia. Pulse oximetry trends are undetectable initially (Figure 51-4) but elevate to the mid-90th percentile 20 to 30 minutes after induction without supplementary oxygen, 22 although supplemental oxygen is advisable, if available. Regurgitation is common upon reversal in field situations; this is likely caused by ingestion of bait just prior to immobilization. Application of a bland ophthalmic ointment protects the eyes during times of blowing sand and debris. Covering the eyes and placing plugs in the ear canal also assists in providing consistent recumbency (Figure 51-5) . On occasion, an anesthetized hyena may require 30 to 40 mg of supplemental ketamine administered intramuscularly to facilitate completion of medical procedures. Reversal is achieved with atipamezole at five times the dose of medetomidine. Atipamezole given intramuscularly produces reliable recovery within 5 to 10 minutes. Blepharospasm, followed by purposeful movement of the head and cervical spine, is an indication of impending recovery. In general, the hyena ambulates away with mild ataxia, which rapidly resolves to normal ambulation within an additional 3 to 5 minutes. It is important to wait at least Note the substrate barrier and covered eyes. The animal also has aural plugs to decrease auditory stimulation. ",

Fecal direct flotation for ova and parasite examination of numerous stool samples collected from latrines and individual wild brown hyenas in 2011 were surprisingly scant; only one sub-adult demonstrated infection with low levels of coccidea. 25 Numerous ectoparasites and endoparasites of Hyaenidae have been reported in the literature, 18 and captive individuals should be screened and treated routinely for clinical parasitemia.
