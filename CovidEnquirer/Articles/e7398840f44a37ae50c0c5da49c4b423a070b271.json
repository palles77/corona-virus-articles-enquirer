This study evaluates the phenolic compound production, antioxidant and antimicrobial (antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral) activities of transgenic hairy root cultures in M. dioica . Hairy roots were induced from leaves, petiole, and internodal explants. Molecular analysis of PCR and gene sequencing using specific primers of rolC and aux1 revealed T-DNA integration in the hairy root clones and RT-PCR analysis confirmed the expression of hairy root inducible genes (rolC and aux1). The greatest biomass accumulation of hairy roots on MS liquid medium supplemented with 3% sucrose was observed at 22 days. Ultra-HPLC was used to compare the individual phenolic compound contents of transgenic and non-transgenic roots. Moreover, transgenic hairy roots efficiently produced several phenolic compounds, such as flavonols, hydroxycinnamic acid and hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives. The total phenolic, flavonoid contents and biological (antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral) activities were higher in hairy roots compared to non-transformed roots. These results demonstrate the greater potentiality of M. dioica hairy root cultures for the production of valuable phenolic compounds and for studies of their biological activity.",

Willd (Family: Cucurbitaceae) is a high nutritional value of wild edible vegetable and also highly used for the traditional medicine (Bharathi et al., 2014) . It is commonly known as spine gourd or small bitter gourd or teasle gourd is an annual or perennial dioecious climber. It has native of tropical regions on Africa, South America and Asia with extensive distribution in Bangladesh, China, India, Japan, and Pakistan (Thiruvengadam and Chung, 2011; Talukdar and Hossain, 2014) . Spine gourd contains significant amount of alkaloids, steroids, triterpenoids, glycosides, saponins, carotenoids, polyphenols, vitamins, and other health promoting phytochemicals, these may be helpful used for antioxidant, diabetes, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, asthma, leprosy, hepatoprotective, analgesic, postcoital anti-fertility, nematocidal, jaundice, bleeding piles, anti-allergic, anti-malarial, anti-feedant, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-viral activities Talukdar and Hossain, 2014) . Seed dormancy and pre-flowering sex determination are major controlling factor of commercial cultivation in spine gourd (Bharathi et al., 2014) . The production of bioactive compounds through in vitro culture has been important and promising aspect of modern biotechnology. To meet the increasing demand for plants utilized in the nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, and cosmetical industry, much of the recent research has focused on the development of in vitro tissue or hairy root culture techniques as a useful alternative to improve the yield of bioactive metabolites in spine gourd.",

Till date, hairy root cultures have been studied for the production of secondary metabolites for used as pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, food additives and cosmetics (Srivastava and Srivastava, 2007; Chandra and Chandra, 2011) . Previously, it was reported that hairy roots enhanced the amount of saponin in Bacopa monnieri (Majumdar et al., 2011) , anthroquinones in Polygonum multiflorum (Thiruvengadam et al., 2014a) , total phenolic content in Solanum lycopersicum , polyphenols in Momordica charantia (Thiruvengadam et al., 2014b) , and glucosinolates in Arabidopsis thaliana (Kastell et al., 2015) . However, there are no reports on the induction of hairy roots, and production of phenolic compounds and also their biological activities from hairy root cultures of spine gourd. The main goal of the present investigation was to develop a biotechnological system for producing bioactive phenolic compounds of M. dioica as an alternative to harvesting the wild plant. First time, we have successfully established an efficient protocol for hairy root cultures of M. dioica for the production of individual phenolic compound profiles (flavonols, hydroxycinnamic and hydroxybenzoic acids) using by UHPLC analysis. In addition, we optimized the different liquid nutrient media and various concentrations of sucrose on hairy root growth, in terms of fresh and dry biomass accumulation in M. dioica . Finally, we evaluated the total phenolic, flavonoid contents, antioxidant and antimicrobial (antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral) activities from transgenic hairy roots and non-transgenic roots of spine gourd.",

The biomass of hairy roots was assessed at 22 days of culture. The roots were separated from the media and their fresh mass (FM) was determined later they were washed with distilled water and the excess surface water blotted away. Dry mass (DM) was noted after the roots were dried at 60 \u2022 C until a consistent weight was observed. The growth ratio was determined as GR = growth ratio is the quotients of the dry mass of harvested biomass and the dry mass of the inoculum. Genomic DNA extracted from transgenic root clones and non-transgenic roots of M. dioica were used the DNA isolation kit (Fermentas Life Sciences, USA). The amplification reaction was carried out in GeneAmp PCR system DNA thermal cycler (PerkinElmer, USA) using 22-mer oligonucleotides as primers. A primer pair of 5 -ATGGCTGAAGACGACCTGTGTT-3 and 5 -TTAGCCGATTGCAAACTTGCAC-3 was used to amplify a \u223c500-bp fragment of the rolC gene (Sivakumar et al., 2005) and 5 -CCAAGCTTGTCAGAAAACTTCAGGG-3 and 5 -CCGGATCCAATACCCAGCGCTTT-3 was designed to amplify a \u223c815-bp fragment of the aux1 gene (Medina-Bolivar et al., 2007) . In addition, primers (5 -ATGCCCGATCGAGCTCAAGT-3 and 5 -CCTGACCCAAACATCTCGGCT-3 ), amplifying a fragment of \u223c338 bp were used for detecting the virD2 gene (Medina-Bolivar et al., 2007) .

            "text": "In order to assess the molecular confirmation of the hairy roots, we used a PCR analysis that targeted the A. rhizogenes rolC, aux1 and virD2 genes. The rolC and aux1 genes, located on independent T-DNAs (TL-DNA and TR-DNA, respectively) of the Ri plasmid of A. rhizogenes strain, are diagnostic for T-DNA integration into the host genome. The virD2 gene, located outside the T-DNA, is diagnostic for the presence of any remaining Agrobacteria in the root tissue. The integration of Ri T-DNA into the genome of plant cells caused the formation of hairy roots, in which rol and aux genes were harbored (Gai et al., 2015) . The rol and aux genes are essential for the induction of hairy roots and it act as a potential activator of secondary metabolites in several plants (Bulgakov, 2008; Park et al., 2011; Nagella et al., 2013; Gai et al., 2015) . PCR amplification of the rolC and aux1 genes in A. rhizogenes induced roots was confirmed by the stable and typical hairy root phenotype of the cultured roots (Fig. 1c) . Four randomly selected fast growing transgenic hairy root lines, non-transgenic roots (negative control) and Agrobacterium cultures (positive control) were used. Integration of the A. rhizogenes Ri plasmid T-DNA into the M. dioica genome was confirmed by PCR, RT-PCR and sequencing for the rolC and aux1 genes. The primers for rolC, aux1 and virD2 were used according to the method earlier described (Sivakumar et al., 2005; Medina-Bolivar et al., 2007) . PCR and RT-PCR analysis using rolC and aux1 specific primer with fragments of \u223c500 bp and 815 bp confirmed the transgenic roots. The fragment for rolC and aux1 were observed in the amplified DNA from all the four hairy root lines and positive control ( Fig. 1c and d) . No such amplification product was found in the DNA isolated from non-transformed control roots ( Fig. 1c  and d) . Furthermore, the virD2 gene was used to verify the complete absence of A. rhizogenes in the hairy roots lines of M. dioica (Fig 1c) . This result indicates that pRi T-DNA fragments of A. rhizogenes were successfully integrated into the genome of M. dioica without bacterial residues. The sequence of the eluted PCR product was obtained and submitted to NCBI GenBank. Sequence analysis in BLASTn indicated alignments with the rolC gene, thereby confirming its integration in the transgenic hairy roots. The obtained full length coding sequence of rolC gene (543 nucleotides) encodes 181 amino acids. The use of PCR combined with DNA sequencing as a instead of Southern blotting for the characterization of transgenic plants has the advantage that the newly inserted genes can be detected at an earlier stage with less DNA and less plant material (Vergauwe et al., 1996; Gangopadhyay et al., 2010; Thiruvengadam et al., 2014b) .",

Caffeic and chlorogenic acids were major hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives in hairy roots (501.50 and 495.00 g/g) and nontransformed roots (515.25 and 437.10 g/g) compared to ferulic, p-coumaric, o-coumaric and t-cinnamic acids. Caffeic acid induced inhibition of adventitious root formation in mung bean (Singh et al., 2009) . Consistent with our results, caffeic acid content level decreased in hairy roots compared to non-transformed roots. Chlorogenic acid containing plant materials have been shown to have antiviral, antifungal, and strong antibacterial activities (Karunanidhi et al., 2013) . Gentisic and salicylic acids were predominant hydroxybenzoic acid groups in hairy roots (538.15 and 485.00 g/g) and non-transformed roots (465.85 and 411.00 g/g) followed by gallic, p-hydroxybenzoic, syringic, protocatechuic, \u2424resorcylic and vanillic acids. The amount of p-coumaric, ferulic, chlorogenic, p-hydroxybenzoic, gallic, syringic, gentisic, salicylic, and veratric acids were higher in transgenic hairy roots than that in non-transgenic roots of M. dioica (P \u2264 0.05). Similarly, the content of chlorogenic, protocatechuic, ferulic acids were higher in transgenic hairy roots than non-transgenic roots of tomato . The present study exhibited that hairy roots contained higher amount of individual phenolic compounds compared to non-transgenic plants. Similarly, phenolic acid derivatives such as chlorogenic acid and quercetin were presented higher amount in hairy roots when compared with wild type roots of F. tataricum (Kim et al., 2009 ).",

The antioxidant potential of hairy roots and non-transformed roots were determined using free radicals scavenging, reducing potential, phosphomolybdenum assays and metal chelating activity. DPPH is a stable radical, which could be easily used for the detection of antioxidant properties of different compounds in term of hydrogen donating ability. The highest antioxidant activity was exhibited in hairy roots (67.15%) compared to non-transformed roots (61.50%; P \u2264 0.05) (Fig. 3c) . The present investigation on the reducing capacity of extracts suggests that hairy roots were more potential when compared to non-transformed roots (P \u2264 0.05) (Fig. 3d) . The antioxidant capacity through phosphomolybdenum method of the hairy roots and non-transformed root extracts were measured spectrophotometrically, which is based on the reduction of Mo (IV) to Mo (V) by the sample analyte, and the subsequent formation of green phosphate/Mo (V) compounds. The antioxidant capacity of the hairy root extract was 2.21 mg/g and non-transformed root extract was 1.55 mg/g (Fig. 3e) . Chelating agent may inhibit radical generation by stabilizing transition metals, consequently reducing free radical damage. Ferrozine can make complexes with ferrous ions. In the presence of chelating agents complex (red color) formation is interrupted and as a result, the red color of the complex is decrease. Fig. 3f shows the percentage of metal scavenging capacity of transgenic roots (71.10%) was higher than non-transgenic roots (64.25%). The present investigation, hairy roots showed higher antioxidant activity compared to non-transformed roots (P \u2264 0.05).",

The results from the disc diffusion method indicated that both hairy roots and non-transformed root extracts had comparable antibacterial effects against Gram positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Hairy roots exhibited highest activity with both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria compared to non-transformed roots of M. dioica (P \u2264 0.05). Grampositive (S. aureus) bacteria was exhibited greater inhibition compared to Gram-negative (P. aeruginosa and E. coli) bacteria. Table 3 depicts the results from the disc diffusion method against the fungal strains. It can be seen that extracts of M. dioica hairy roots and non-transformed roots exhibited good antifungal activity. These results were compared with the standard drugs of chloramphenicol and thymol for bacterial and fungal activity (P \u2264 0.05). Previously, it was reported that the antimicrobial spectrums of the hairy root extracts was more effective against gram-positive bacteria than gram-negative bacteria (Jain et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2012) . Previously many reports confirmed that hairy roots exhibited higher antibacterial and antifungal activity compared to non-transformed roots (Jain et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2012; Thiruvengadam et al., 2014b) . Flavonoid derivatives have also been reported to possess antiviral activity against a wide range of viruses such as HSV, HIV, Coxsackie B virus, coronavirus, cytomegalovirus, poliomyelitis virus, rhinovirus, rotavirus, poliovirus, sindbis virus, and rabies virus (\u00d6z\u00e7 elik et al., 2011) . Cytotoxicity activity of hairy and non-transgenic root extracts were carried out against IBDV at different concentrations to determine the IC 50 (50% growth inhibition) by MTT assay. Results of different concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10 mg/mL) of hairy root and non-transgenic root extracts. MTT assay of hairy and nontransgenic root extracts shows the significant effect on IBDV cell in concentration range between 10-1 mg/mL compared with control. The highest cytotoxicity of this extract against IBDV cell was found in 5 and 2.5 mg/mL concentration with 86.12 and 80.19% of cell growth inhibition in hairy roots and 78.50 and 71.09% in non-transgenic root extracts. It was found that the percentage of growth inhibition to be increasing with increasing concentration of test compounds. To detect inhibition of virus yield in DF-1 cells by extract of hairy roots and non-transformed roots, virus titers in cultured supernatants for IBDV infected DF-1 cells with or without treatment were measured at 24 and 48 h after infection, using plaque assay of hairy roots and non-transformed roots showed dose-dependent inhibition of IBDV replication in DF-1 cells, but no time-dependent inhibitory effect on IBDV production in vitro . Particularly, hairy roots and non-transgenic roots (1 mg/mL) showed virus yield reduced (42 and 58%) respectively after 24 h incubation. Previously, M. charantia was reported to possess several antivi-ral activities including hepatitis B virus, dengue virus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and influenza A subtypes including H1N1, H3N2, H5N1 (Pongthanapisith et al., 2013) . Consistent with our reports hairy roots have potential antiviral activity compared with non-transgenic roots in Phylanthus amarus (Bhattacharyya and Bhattacharya, 2004) and Daucus carota (Luchakivskaya et al., 2012) . Our results recommended transgenic hairy roots can be effectively used for the healing of bacterial, fungal and viral diseases.",

The phenolic groups like flavonols, hydroxycinnamic and hydroxybenzoic acids were higher in transgenic roots when compared to non-transgenic roots. The total phenolic, flavonoid contents and biological (antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral) activities were higher in hairy roots than non-transformed roots. The higher amount of polyphenolic compounds possibly contributes to greater biological activity of hairy roots in M. dioica. The genetic and biochemical stability of the hairy roots as well as its high productivity offers an effective platform for further studies on the biosynthetic pathways of phenolic compounds.",
