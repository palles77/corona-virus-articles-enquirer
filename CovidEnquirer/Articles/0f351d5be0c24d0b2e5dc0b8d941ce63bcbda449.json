Here, we report the crystal structure of M pro at a resolution of 1.82 \u00c5, in space group P2 1 at pH 6.0. In contrast to the previously reported structure of M pro in the same space group at the same pH, the active sites and the S1 specificity pockets of both protomers in the structure of M pro reported here are in the catalytically competent conformation, suggesting their conformational flexibility. We report two crystal structures of M pro having an additional Ala at the N terminus of each protomer (M +A(-1) pro ), both at a resolution of 2.00 \u00c5, in space group P4 3 2 1 2: one unbound and one bound by a substrate-like aza-peptide epoxide (APE). In the unbound form, the active sites and the S1 specificity pockets of both protomers of M +A(-1) pro are observed in a collapsed (catalytically incompetent) conformation; whereas they are in an open (catalytically competent) conformation in the APE-bound form. The observed conformational flexibility of the active sites and the S1 specificity pockets suggests that these parts of M pro exist in dynamic equilibrium. The structural data further suggest that the binding of APE to M pro follows an induced-fit model. The substrate likely also binds in an induced-fit manner in a process that may help drive the catalytic cycle.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly transmissible, infectious and often fatal disease (World Health Organization-Severe acute respiratory syndrome \u2020). Since its outbreak in 2002 and rapid spread throughout early 2003, efforts in the development of anti-SARS vaccines and drugs have taken on paramount importance. SARS is caused by a coronavirus (CoV); 1\u22123 it is an enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus. Anti-SARS therapeutics could target any one of several major steps in the viral life-cycle, such as virus-cell interactions, virus entry, intracellular viral replication, virus assembly and exit. 4 Extensive studies have been carried out on the proteins involved in these steps. 5 The intracellular replication of CoV is mediated by a replicase complex derived from two virally coded polyprotein precursors, pp1a (486 kDa) and pp1ab (790 kDa). 6, 7 The formation of this replicase complex requires the extensive processing of the two polyproteins by two cysteine peptidases encoded within them; namely, the main peptidase (M pro ), also known as the 3C-like peptidase (3CL pro ) because of its similarity to the 3C peptidases of Picornaviridae, 8 and the accessory papain-like peptidase 2 (PL2 pro ), 7 which cleaves at three sites in the N-proximal regions of the two polyproteins. By contrast, M pro cleaves at 11 sites in the central and C-proximal regions of the two polyproteins, releasing key viral replication pro-teins, such as an RNA polymerase and a helicase. 7 As an essential protein, M pro is an attractive molecular target for the development of anti-SARS drugs.",

All of these structures show that the two protomers of M pro are oriented almost perpendicular to each other. The Nterminal residues 1-7 of each protomer constitute the N-finger, of which Arg4 was shown to be mandatory for the dimerization and the exhibition of the catalytic activity of M pro . 14 Beyond the Nfinger, each protomer consists of three domains. Domain I (residues 8-101) and domain II (residues 102-184) comprise a two-\u03b2-barrel fold similar to that of the chymotrypsin-type serine peptidases. Domain III (residues 201-300) has five \u03b1-helices and is connected to domain II by a long loop (residues 185-200). Each protomer has its own substratebinding region situated in the cleft between domains I and II. Recent mutagenesis studies have confirmed that, similar to the main peptidases from human coronavirus strain 229E, 15, 16 and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus, 17 SARS-CoV M pro is a cysteine peptidase with a Cys-His catalytic dyad at the active site. 16, 18 As suggested by the structure-based sequence alignment of the main peptidases (including their flanking residues in the polyproteins) from SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses, 16 and confirmed by in vitro studies, 7, 9 M pro cleaves preferentially at a consensus sequence for the P4 to P1\u2032 residues of substrates (the nomenclature is based on that used by Schechter & Berger 19 with the arrow indicating the cleavage site): (amino acid with a small side-chain)-(any amino acid)-Leu-Gln\u2193(Ala, Ser, Gly).",

            "text": "A number of M pro inhibitors have been proposed using structure-based discovery 20, 21 and experimental screening. [22] [23] [24] The crystal structures of M pro inhibited by some peptidomimetic compounds have been determined. 25\u221227 Recently, virtual screening followed by experimental evaluations have identi-fied the old drug cinanserin as a strong inhibitor of the replication of SARS-CoV; cinanserin likely targets M pro . 28 We have reported on the kinetic and structural characterization of the inhibition of SARS-CoV M pro by an aza-peptide epoxide (APE, Figure 1 ). 29 APEs were synthesized as a new class of inhibitors apparently specific for clan CD cysteine peptidases, 30, 31 including the legumains, 32 and the caspases. 33 Each APE has an aza-peptide component, with an epoxide moiety attached to the carbonyl group of the P1 residue. The side-chain of the P1 residue predominantly determines the target-peptidase specificity of an APE. The substituent on the epoxide C2 atom also allows some tuning of both the inhibitory activity and specificity of APE towards a particular target peptidase. In the APE, the C \u03b1 atom of the P1 residue is replaced by a nitrogen atom, yielding an aza-amino acid residue. This introduces trigonal planar geometry to the \u03b1-atom of the P1 residue and reduces the electrophilicity of the carbonyl C atom of the P1 residue, thereby making the carbonyl group of the P1 residue resistant to nucleophilic attack. 34 It has been proposed that APEs inhibit their target peptidases irreversibly by a mechanism in which the catalytic Cys S \u03b3 atom nucleophilically attacks one of the two epoxide carbon atoms (C2 or C3) of APE. 30, 32, 33 This results in the opening of the conformationally strained epoxide ring, with the formation of a covalent bond between the Cys S \u03b3 atom and the attacked APE atom. An APE containing Gln at P1 inhibits M pro with a k inact /K i = 1900(\u00b1400) M \u22121 s \u22121 .

On the basis of this trend, a pH-triggered switch for the catalytic activity of M pro was proposed. 25 We have now grown crystals of M pro in the same space group (P2 1 with the same unit-cell constants) at pH 6.0 under slightly different conditions; the active sites and the S1 specificity pockets of both protomers are in the catalytically competent conformation (Figures 2(a) and (b), 3(a) and (b), 4(a) and (b)). More specifically, superposition of protomers A and B of the resulting M pro structure (rmsd 0.50 \u00c5 for 1070 out of 1172 main-chain atoms) shows good agreement in most atomic positions.

The remaining 5% of the reflections were selected randomly before the structure refinement and are not included in the structure refinement. R free was calculated over these reflections with the equation used for R work . 54 accommodates the carbonyl O atom of the scissile peptide bond of the substrate; the position to be occupied by the carbonyl O atom is occupied by a water molecule. The O atom of the water molecule forms hydrogen bonds at distances of 3.0 \u00c5 with the Gly143 N atom and with the Cys145 N atom (Figure 3 (a) and (b)). Previous studies suggest strongly that the predominant S1 specificity of SARS-CoV M pro for Gln is determined primarily by the conserved residue His163. 15, 16, 35 In both independent protomers, the orientation of the imidazole ring of His163 is determined by the hydrogen bonding between its N \u03b41 atom and the OH group of Tyr161 (3.0 \u00c5) and by its \u03c0-stacking with the phenyl ring of Phe140 (the distance between the geometric centers of the aromatic rings is 3.9 \u00c5). The position to be occupied by the side-chain carbonyl O atom of P1-Gln of the substrate is occupied by a water molecule, whose O atom forms a hydrogen bond with the His163 N \u03b52 atom (2.9 \u00c5); this water molecule is coplanar with the atoms of the imidazole ring of His163. In both protomers, Phe140 and Glu166 interact with Ser1 of the opposite protomer to form the \"floor\" of the S1 specificity pocket (Figure 3 (a) and (b)). In protomer A, the Glu166A O \u03b51 atom forms a hydrogen bond (2.8 \u00c5) with the His172A N \u03b52 atom, thereby constituting a \"side-wall\" of the S1 specificity pocket similar to that in protomer A of previously reported structures and the molecular-dynamic simulation model of M pro at pH 6.0 (Figure 3(a) ). 25, 36 However, in protomer B of the structure of M pro reported here, the side-chain of Glu166B rotates away and the His172B N \u03b52 atom forms a hydrogen bond (3.0 \u00c5) with the Ser1A O \u03b3 atom of protomer A instead. The Ser1A O \u03b3 atom also forms a hydrogen bond (2.8 \u00c5) with the Gly170B carbonyl O atom (Figure 3 (b)). The difference in the side-chain conformation of Glu166 in protomers A and B of the structure of M pro reported here indicates the weakness of the interaction between the side-chains of Glu166 and His172, even though this interaction may acquire some ionic character by the protonation of the His172 N \u03b41 atom. Contrary to those in protomer B of both the previously reported structure and the moleculardynamic simulation model of M pro at pH 6.0, 25,36 the side-chains of His163B and Glu166B do not interact in protomer B of the structure of M pro reported here, probably because His163B is protonated only at its N \u03b52 atom and carries no charge.",

The oxyanion hole is not distorted as much; the N atoms of Gly143 and Cys145 are still oriented to donate hydrogen bonds that would stabilize the negatively charged carbonyl O atom of the scissile peptide bond of the substrate, although no water molecule is found at the position to be occupied by the carbonyl O atom (Figure 3(c) ). The hydrogen bond between the N \u03b41 atom of His163 and the OH group of Tyr161 is preserved (3.1 \u00c5); however, the imidazole ring of His163 is no longer \u03c0-stacked with the phenyl ring of Phe140; it makes contacts with the side-chain of Leu141 instead (Figure 3(c) ). Here the phenyl ring of Phe140 makes contacts with the side-chains of Val114, Tyr126, Ile136 and His172, and the mainchain atoms of Lys137 and Gly138 from the parent protomer, and with the side-chain of Arg4 from the opposite protomer. The Phe140 carbonyl O atom also forms a long hydrogen bond with the OH group of Tyr118 (3.4 \u00c5). The electron density maps show two possible conformers of the side-chain of Glu166; the occupancies of both conformers were fixed at 0.5 Figure 2 (legend on next page) without refinement. In conformer 1, the Glu166 O \u03b51 atom forms a hydrogen bond with the His172 N \u03b41 atom (2.3 \u00c5), and the Glu166 O \u03b52 atom forms a hydrogen bond with the His163 N \u03b52 atom (2.8 \u00c5); whereas in conformer 2, the side-chain of Glu166 protrudes into the solvent (Figure 3(c) ). Probably because of their high mobility, the additional Ala at the N terminus, Ser1 and Gly2 of the protomer could not be identified in the electron density maps of the unbound M +A(-1) pro . Interactions similar to those forming the floors of the S1 specificity pockets of M pro are not observed in the unbound M +A (-1) pro . The rest of the substrate-binding region in the structure of the unbound M +A(-1) pro reported here is in the catalytically competent conformation, in good agreement with those in the previously reported structures of the APE-bound M +A(-1) pro and of M pro , except for some side-chains whose conformational rearrangements are necessary in order to accommodate APE or the other inhibitors.",

Outstanding electron density for APE was observed only in the electron density maps of M +A(-1) pro ; it could be fit only by the 2S,3S diastereomer ( Figure 6(a) ). The latter is consistent with the results of the studies on the inhibition of M pro by the APE in these versions.

In the determinations of both structures, the complete wild-type sequence (residues 1-306) of M pro was over-expressed, purified and crystallized. Although different strategies might have been used in the X-ray diffraction data collection and processing, and in the structure solution and refinement, this could not result in the dramatic structural differences observed. The structural differences probably arise from the differences in the conditions of the preparation and the crystallization of M pro . Similarly, the crystal structure of M pro in space group P2 1 2 1 2 at pH 6.5 shows that both protomers are in the catalytically competent conformation, 37 whereas that in the same space group P2 1 2 1 2 and at a slightly higher pH (6.6) shows that both protomers of the latter are in the catalytically incompetent conformation. 36 The conformations of the collapsed active sites and S1 specificity pockets observed in the catalytically incompetent protomers show some variability. This variability indicates that the active site and the S1 specificity pocket of each protomer of M pro do not adopt a single conformation in solution at pH 5.9-6.6, but instead there is an ensemble of conformations. A particular conformation might be favored by a particular set of crystallization conditions. However, the various conformations of the collapsed active sites and S1 specificity pockets share a common feature: the imidazole ring of His163 is not \u03c0-stacked with the phenyl ring of Phe140. \u03c0-stacking is an example of aromatic interactions. 38 In the structures of the unbound M pro , an aromatic interaction is observed between these two rings in an offset-stacked (i.e. \u03c0-stacking) or an edge-to-face fashion wherever the protomer is in the catalytically competent conformation (Figure 8 ). In both orientations, one or two hydrogen atoms (with partial positive charge) on the phenyl ring of Phe140 are positioned near the central region (with partial negative charge) of the imidazole ring of His163. According to the results of previous studies, 39,40 a single aromatic interaction as such is weak (the interaction energy may be in the range of 1-2 kcal/ mol only), in contrast to the clusters of aromatic interactions commonly involved in the stabilization of protein structures. 41 Therefore, this interaction is susceptible to disruptions that could be caused by changes in a number of factors; the formation of this interaction can be viewed as a reversible process in dynamic equilibrium:",

More particularly, the binding of the APE induces the recovery of the catalytically competent conformation of the oxyanion holes and the S1 specificity pockets of both protomers of M +A (-1) pro . This induced fit is likely relevant to the binding of APE to M pro , because of the conformational flexibility of the active sites and the S1 specificity pockets of M pro discussed above. In all of the crystal structures of the inhibitor-bound M pro (both the wild-type and the variants) determined so far, [25] [26] [27] 29, 42 except for protomer B in the complex of M pro with a chloromethyl ketone (CMK), 25 the active sites and the S1 specificity pockets are in the catalytically competent conformation ( Table 2 ). The induced-fit binding of the APE to M +A(-1) pro probably is driven by the formation of the covalent bond between the Cys145 S \u03b3 atom of M +A(-1) pro and the epoxide C3 atom of the APE. It would be energetically costly to break this C-S bond in order to repel the APE and preserve the conformational flexibility of the active sites and the S1 specificity pockets of M +A (-1) pro . Therefore, the active sites and the S1 specificity pockets of M +A(-1) pro have to adopt the catalytically competent conformation in order to accommodate a substrate mimic like APE. This explanation probably applies to the actual catalytic cycle of M pro as well: the acylation step (i.e. formation of As the side-chain of P1-AGln of the APE occupies the S1 specificity pockets of M +A(-1) pro , the side-chain amide N atom of P1-AGln of the APE donates hydrogen bonds to the Phe140 carbonyl O atom and to the Glu166 O \u03b51 and O \u03b52 atoms of M +A (-1) pro , in addition to the hydrogen bond between the sidechain carbonyl O atom of P1-AGln of the APE and the His163 N \u03b52 atom of M +A (-1) pro . Similarly, additional hydrogen bonds are observed in the crystal structures of the M +A (-1) pro :APE complex in space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 , the M pro :APE complex, 29 protomer A of the M pro :CMK complex, 25 and the complex of M pro with a peptidomimetic inhibitor. 26 In the crystal structures of the complexes of an M pro variant with a series of peptidomimetic inhibitors, these hydrogen bonds seem to be water-mediated. 27 Consequently, even without the participation of Ser1 of the opposite protomer of M +A(-1) pro , Phe140 and Glu166 are tied together by these hydrogen bonds to form parts of the floors of the S1 specificity pockets. These hydrogen bonds also conformationally anchor Phe140, as indicated by its close-to-average B-factors ( Figure 5(d) ), and make the \u03c0-stacking of its phenyl ring with the imidazole ring of His163 resistant to disruption. As a result, the catalytically competent conformation of the active sites and the S1 specificity pockets of M +A(-1) pro is rigidified; the position of the equilibrium described by equation (1) would shift to the left. This probably serves as an additional explanation for the predominant S1 specificity of M pro or M +A(-1) pro for Gln, but not for Glu. Comparison of the structure of the unbound M pro with that of the APE-bound M pro , both in space group C2 at pH 6.5, 29 does not show an obvious reduction in the Bfactors of residues Lys137 to Ser144 upon the binding of the APE to M pro , probably because Phe140 and Glu166 of the parent protomer, and Ser1 of the opposite protomer in the unbound M pro interact normally and immobilize these residues.",

In protomer A of the M pro :CMK complex, although the active site and the S1 specificity pocket of M pro are in the catalytically competent conformation (Table 2) , allowing the side-chain of P1-Gln of the CMK to occupy the S1 specificity pocket of M pro , the unoccupied space in the rest of the substrate-binding region of M pro is large enough for the conformational rearrangements in the rest of the CMK, resulting in an unexpected binding mode of the CMK to protomer A of M pro as well. 25 These unexpected binding modes are not observed in the crystal structures of the complexes of M pro (both the wild-type and the variants) with the APE, 29 nor with the peptidomimetic inhibitors, 26, 27 probably because their P' ester groups sterically hinder the rotation of the C-S covalent bond formed between the peptidases and the inhibitors. In the case of the APE, the \u03c0-conjugation of the N \u03b1 atom and the carbonyl group of P1-AGln restricts the orientation of the side-chain of P1-AGln to point towards the S1 specificity pockets of M pro or M +A (-1) pro . In the case of the peptidomimetic inhibitors, the C atom attacked by the Cys145 S \u03b3 atom corresponds to the carbonyl C atom of the scissile peptide bond of a substrate. Therefore, the resulting C-S bond pulls the inhibitor towards the back wall of the substrate-binding region. This reinforces the steric hindrance due to Figure 9 .

However, these protomers are conformationally flexible; the recovery of their catalytically competent conformation can be induced by the binding of a substrate. The activity of M pro is still compromised, because of the energetic cost associated with this induced-fit binding. It would be interesting to determine this energetic cost quantitatively, and compare it with the experimentally determined decrease in the activity of M pro . Before carrying out such studies, the possibility of a second mechanism, such as the change in the protonation/ deprotonation state of the catalytic dyad with pH, being involved in the pH-dependence of the activity of M pro should not be ruled out.",

Extensive studies have been carried out on the role of domain III in the dimerization of M pro . With domain III truncated, the protomer of M pro does not dimerize over a wide range of concentrations, 10,14 whereas domain III alone forms a stable dimer even at very low concentrations. 10 Truncation of the final C-terminal helix (residues 293-306) strongly disfavors the dimerization of M pro ; 14,43 analysis of the dimer interfaces observed in the structures of M pro found that most of the residues of domain III involved in dimer interactions are parts of the final C-terminal helix. Superpositions of the previously reported structures of M pro in space group P2 1 at pH 6.0, 7.6 and 8.0, 25 show that domain III of both independent protomers rotates in a rigid-body manner as the pH increases from 6.0 to 8.0, whereas the remainder of the M pro dimer remains essentially in the same atomic positions (Figure 10 ). Domain III of protomer B rotates through a slightly greater angle than does domain III of protomer A. This rotation was regarded as a consequence of the recovery of the catalytically competent conformation of the active sites and the S1 specificity pockets of M pro as the pH increased from 6.0 to 8.0. However, the structure of M pro in space group P2 1 at pH 6.0 reported here, having the active sites and the S1 specificity pockets of both protomers in the catalytically competent conformation, shows good agreement in the atomic positions of domain III of both independent protomers with the previously reported structure of M pro in space group P2 1 at pH 6.0, but not with those at pH 7.6 or pH 8.0. The interactions between the domain-III residues of opposite protomers, and the interactions of the residues of domain III with those of domains I and II of the same protomer have been analyzed, but the mechanics of this rotation is still unclear. The structures of M pro in the other space groups have not been studied over such a wide range of pH. It would be interesting to explore whether this rotation is an artifact associated with crystal packing in space group P2 1 , or whether similar rotations occur in the structures of M pro in the other space groups as well, indicating some biochemical significance of this rotation. For example, the rotation may represent a mechanism underlying the pH-dependence of the dimerization behaviors of M pro . 12",

In the refinement of all of the structures of the APE-bound M pro and M +A(-1) pro , a restraint was applied to this C-S bond on the basis that the length of a C-S single bond is normally about 1.8 \u00c5. Interestingly, the opened epoxide moiety of the APE always tended to be tilted away from Cys145 of M pro or M +A(-1) pro , thereby lengthening this C-S bond by 0.2-0.3 \u00c5, even though the opened epoxide moiety of the APE was manually moved back towards Cys145 of M pro or M +A(-1) pro regularly during the refinement process. Although such lengthening is not considered significant as the overall positional uncertainties (based on maximum likelihood) of all these structures are in the range of 0.2-0.3 \u00c5, it does suggest the possibility of this C-S bond being under strain and vulnerable to rupture caused by a second nucleophilic attack at the epoxide C3 atom of the APE (say, by an activated water molecule), leading",
