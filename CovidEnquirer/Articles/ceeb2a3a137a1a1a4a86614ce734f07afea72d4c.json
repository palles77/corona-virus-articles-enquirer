The causes of early pregnancy loss include fetal chromosomal abnormalities, maternal conditions, intrauterine infections, maternal-fetal incompatibilities, and unknown causes. 1 The early pregnancy assessment clinic (EPAC) model has been shown to provide improved efficiency and quality of care in the management of early pregnancy complications. 3 EPACs are not common in Canada; however, they are becoming increasingly popular. In Vancouver, British Columbia, patients reported satisfaction with the emotional support and care provided at an EPAC, 4 and in Halifax, Nova Scotia, an early pregnancy complications clinic provides care to women with early pregnancy losses. 5 An EPAC at North York General Hospital in Toronto, Ontario was established in August of 2005. The clinic continues to serve women from anywhere in central Toronto and the greater Toronto area of Ontario. The model of the clinic was described in our previous study in 2009. 6 Since then the hours of the clinic have remained the same, and over 20 000 visits were made between August 2005 and 2015. The aim of the present study was to assess whether the EPAC has had a sustained impact over the 10 years of the study period on the management of early pregnancy complications and on the number of assessments and reassessments in the emergency room (ER).",

[15] [16] [17] [18] However, there are fewer studies exploring the effect of the EPAC model of care on the number of assessments and reassessments in the ER for early pregnancy complications. An Australian study found that following the Sustained value of early pregnancy assessment in management of early pregnancy complications -10-year retrospective establishment of an early pregnancy problem service clinic, there was a significant reduction in the median length of stay in the ER for women experiencing pain or bleeding in early pregnancy; however, there was a non-significant reduction in the proportion of assessments and reassessments in the ER. 19 Another study found that implementing the use of a gynaecology outpatient clinic decreased the proportion of ER assessments for miscarriages from 31% in 2001 to 17% in 2009. 20 Our study showed that throughout a 10-year period, the EPAC has continued to provide care to women with early pregnancy complications; however, there has not been an impact in reducing the number of ER assessments and reassessments for miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. The significant decreasing trend seen in the percentage of ER reassessments for hemorrhage is likely not a result of the EPAC because there was a concomitant decrease in EPAC visits for hemorrhage during the same period.",

            "text": "The increase in ER assessments and reassessments for miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy is mirrored by an increase in EPAC clinic visits for these conditions. Therefore, the EPAC is continuing to manage these early pregnancy complications successfully in response to population trends and needs. However, it is speculated that the lack of impact on ER visits could reflect the clinic's limited hours of operation, which has remained unchanged since its implementation at 3 half-days a week. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in the United Kingdom recommended that early pregnancy units should be easily accessible and available to patients on a daily basis during the normal working week for the service to be effective. 21 There are several limitations to our study. When analyzing the pre-EPAC data, we were able to obtain data only from 1 year (2004) before the implementation of the EPAC, for two reasons: First, the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System coding that we used to extract ER early pregnancy complications data was not implemented until April 2002. Second, in 2003, as a result of the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, the number of ER visits was significantly low during the summer months; therefore, the 2003 data were not used in our analysis. The limited pre-EPAC data reduced the effectiveness of evaluating the sustainability of EPAC (comparing pre-EPAC with post-EPAC average ER visit rates) and also restricted the use of more appropriate statistical analysis such as an interrupted time-series analysis. If there had been more pre-EPAC data, it is possible that different trends may have been seen in ER visits for early pregnancy complications. Because of these limitations, a Mann-Kendall test was used to detect any monotonic trends in ER assessment rates and reassessment rates for early pregnancy complications after the EPAC opened. Furthermore, covariates such as patients' age, GA, infections in pregnancy, education, and socioeconomic status were not included in the trend and pre-EPAC vs post-EPAC analyses. These covariates may affect the number of ER assessments and reassessments. In addition, we did not have a link between the ER data and the EPAC data to determine whether patients seen in the ER were being followed up in the EPAC.",

This would improve the efficiency of the service. Furthermore, with greater awareness about the EPAC service over the 10-year study period, there has been an increase in referrals for early pregnancy complications that likely would not have come to North York General Hospital otherwise. Therefore, it is possible that the increasing number of ER visits reflects patients presenting to the ER as a means of being referred to the EPAC and/or patients who were seen at the EPAC and decided to return specifically to the North York General Hospital ER for new concerns. The increase in ER visits could also reflect the appropriateness of the counselling provided to patients at EPAC. The ability of staff to counsel patients properly on what to expect with different types of management (i.e., misoprostol vs. expectant management for miscarriage) and when they should go the ER can also affect the trend in ER visits. In the future, as patient counselling improves and other EPACs are implemented, it is likely that ER visits for early pregnancy complications will be reduced.",
