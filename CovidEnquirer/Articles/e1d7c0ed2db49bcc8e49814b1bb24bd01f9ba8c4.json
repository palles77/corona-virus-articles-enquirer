            "text": "cancer chemotherapy possesses high toxicity, particularly when a higher concentration of drugs is administered to patients. Therefore, searching for more effective compounds to reduce the toxicity of treatments, while still producing similar effects as current chemotherapy regimens, is required. currently, the search for potential anticancer agents involves a random, inaccurate process with strategic deficits and a lack of specific targets. For this reason, the initial in vitro high-throughput steps in the screening process should be reviewed for rapid identification of the compounds that may serve as anticancer agents. The present study aimed to investigate the potential use of the Pichia pastoris strain SMd1168H expressing dna topoisomerase i (SMd1168H-ToPoi) in a yeast-based assay for screening potential anticancer agents. The cell density that indicated the growth of the recombinant yeast without treatment was first measured by spectrophotometry. Subsequently, the effects of glutamate (agonist) and camptothecin (antagonist) on the recombinant yeast cell density were investigated using the same approach, and finally, the effect of camptothecin on various cell lines was determined and compared with its effect on recombinant yeast. The current study demonstrated that growth was enhanced in SMd1168H-ToPoi as compared with that in SMd1168H. Glutamate also enhanced the growth of the SMd1168H; however, the growth effect was not enhanced in SMd1168H-ToPoi treated with glutamate. By contrast, camptothecin caused only lower cell density and growth throughout the treatment of SMD1168H-TOPOI. The findings of the current study indicated that SMd1168H-ToPoi has similar characteristics to Mda-MB-231 cells; therefore, it can be used in a yeast-based assay to screen for more effective compounds that may inhibit the growth of highly metastatic breast cancer cells.",

Breast cancer chemotherapy is commonly administered orally or by intravenous injection daily (3) . in adjuvant and neo-adjuvant settings, chemotherapeutic drugs are usually given as a combination of two or more drugs, since single-drug chemotherapy is less effective (3) ; however, the toxicity of combined chemotherapy is also greater if the treatment programme is not planned appropriately. an inappropriate combination of chemotherapy may not be able to treat or reduce the spread of breast cancer, and may continuously destroy other dividing cells and affect surrounding healthy tissue. indeed, the majority of the current chemotherapies cause pain and adverse effects in patients, including nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, fatigue, mouth soreness, hair loss, weight gain, premature menopause, reduced resistance to infections and increased bleeding (4) (5) (6) . Therefore, it is important to seek effective treatment strategies or combination therapies for breast cancer using novel compounds/substances from natural products, which frequently have reduced toxicity in comparison with traditional chemotherapies. naturally-occurring anti-cancer products may reduce pain, while preventing the spread of cancer cells to other parts of the body.",

Conducting these assays requires costly laboratory facilities and cell culture expertise, as the culture is sensitive to impurities in the tested agents, which may cause contamination unless the crude extracts used are dissolved in an antimicrobial solvent, such as dimethyl sulfoxide. Furthermore, these assays rely on slow-growing cell lines, in which multiple passages may also change the genotype and phenotype of the cells. Thus, a cost-effective approach is required to overcome these limitations, as subjecting all unidentified compounds to cell-based screening in the early screening process is costly.",

The growth of the yeast cells was induced using 1.0% (v/v) methanol. after 12 h of incubation, culture medium with 100 \u00b5M glutamate or L-glutamic acid (97% purity; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaa, darmstadt, Germany; serving as a growth agonist) was added, and cells were incubated for 96 h. a small volume of the sample was withdrawn from the treated culture every 12 h for cell density measurement, and the yeast cell density was expected to be enhanced under these conditions. an optional step involved replenishing the same volume of the medium containing the drug solution in order to maintain the original culture volume. Throughout the assay, methanol was added every 24 h. alternatively, camptothecin (97% purity; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA; serving as a growth antagonist) was added to the culture instead of glutamate. Similar to glutamate-treated cells, samples were withdrawn from the yeast cell culture treated with 100 \u00b5M camptothecin every 12 h for cell density measurement, and the cell density was expected to be inhibited under these culture conditions.",

Subsequently, the cells were treated with increasing concentrations (0-100 \u00b5g/ml) of camptothecin solution for 24, 48 and 72 h. at the end of each incubation period, 24 \u00b5l MTT reagent (5 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) was added to each well, and the reaction was incubated for 4 h. The solution was carefully removed without disturbing the formazan crystals that had formed in each well. Subsequently, 100 \u00b5l acidified isopropanol was added to each well and agitated for homogeneous colour development. Following colour development, the intensity of the colour in the plate was measured at 570 nm using an eliSa plate reader. dose response curves were generated from cell viability (%) plotted against the logarithmic scale (log) concentration of drug used. The responses of camptothecin in cell-based and yeast-based assays were then compared.",

This technique may be useful for screening potential growth inhibitors in the future. a similar strategy has been used to enable high-throughput screening for novel pharmacological modulators of K + channels. in a previous study, an assay was developed based on the growth of yeast that functionally expresses mammalian Kir2.1 channels (14) . in another study, a less demanding phenotypic yeast-based assay on 96-well microplates was established using a methylamine-sensitive yeast strain, in which a methylamine-permeable aquaporin was expressed to rescue proliferation on selection plates, whereby specific inhibition of the aquaporin directly correlated with reduced cell proliferation (15) . engineered-fission yeast strains have also been used in high-throughput screening for phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors that possess 'drug-like' characteristics over a 48-h period by assessing the growth behaviour of the yeast to determine the activity of heterologous cyclic nucleotide Pdes (16) . This system could be used to screen cdna libraries for biological regulators of target Pdes, and to identify whether different Pde protein complexes exhibit distinct patterns of inhibitor sensitivity. To be more specific, a high-throughput yeast-based growth assay has also been used to screen for potential Pde11 inhibitors; however, identifying compounds that inhibit Pde11 is required, as the biological roles of the enzyme are poorly understood (17) . in addition, a robust yeast-based growth assay that is potentially applicable to numerous equilibrative nucleoside transporters (enTs) was developed in order to identify inhibitors of enT1 of the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum (PfenT1) (18) . These inhibitors were detected based on their ability to rescue the growth of PfenT1-expressing fui1\u0394 yeast in the presence of a cytotoxic PfenT1 substrate, 5-fluorouridine. The data supported the hypothesis that blocking purine transport through PfENT1 may be a novel and compelling approach for antimalarial drug development (18) . By contrast, the expression of Xenopus cyclin a1 was induced in a yeast-based growth interference assay in order to elevate the activity of cell division cycle 28 (Cdc28) kinase in the yeast (19) . The hyperactivation of Cdc28 kinase in yeast resulted in growth arrest, and thus compounds that can rescue the cyclin a1-induced growth arrest may be potential novel antitumour drug candidates that act on the cyclin-dependent kinase-mediated cell cycle regulation pathways.",

This strategy provides a simple solution that meets general laboratory needs without requiring specific facilities or equipment to carry out the preliminary screening approach for potential growth inhibitors. indeed, no additional detection kits, enzymes or reagents are required other than the chemical, medium and reagent required to maintain the recombinant yeast. The assay can ideally be used for screening synthetic compounds, plant extracts, nanoparticles, small molecules and chemical compounds extracted from natural products, including flavonoids. Only those agents that produce a positive effect in the yeast-based approach will then proceed to the subsequent steps, which require more costly gel-based or cell-based assays. To the best of our knowledge, the majority of cell-based assays typically require >7 days to be accomplished, whereas the yeast-based assay requires only 6 days (Fig. 4) , which reduces the duration of the screening process by ~15%. As such, this may save months of work in the 12 years required to develop a drug from the original 10,000 test compounds. Therefore, the yeast-based strategy saves time, money and resources, and makes the screening procedures more practical, versatile and competitive in the market, as well as more affordable for the researchers in low-resource laboratories.",

An additional robust high-throughput yeast-based assay to determine potential genotoxicity and mutagenicity of drug candidates early in the discovery phase of drug development was created to replace the most widely used ames Salmonella test, which is not readily adaptable for high-throughput screening, for the assessment of mutagenicity and genotoxicity. The yeast-based system assaying dna repair was able to detect genotoxicity, which incorporated metabolic activation (25) . This assay is efficient, requires little time and small amounts of the compound, while it is adaptable to a high-throughput platform and yields data that accurately and reproducibly detect dna damage based on metabolic activation. Furthermore, the use of genetically tractable model yeast as a vehicle for target-based high-throughput screening has overcome numerous limitations of in vitro biochemical and phenotypic assay platforms for drug discovery by allowing the identification of on-target compounds that function within a eukaryotic cellular context (26) . a yeast-based assay for monitoring Gar-dependent inhibition of translation was also established and identified doxorubicin as a compound that specifically interferes with the Gar effect on translation in yeast (27) . This approach was, thus, validated as an effective high-throughput screening assay for the identification of drugs that interfere with Epstein-Barr virus (eBV) immune evasion and may be candidates for treating eBV-associated diseases, including cancer. another yeast-based system for identifying and screening inhibitors against coronavirus n7-methyltransferase (MTase) was developed using 96-well and 384-well microtiter plates in order to examine MTase inhibitors previously identified using in vitro biochemical assays, such as sinefungin, which effectively suppressed n7-MTase (28) . These results validated the application of a yeast-based assay system for inhibitor screening, while also demonstrating the difference between in vitro and cell-based biochemical assays, whereby more potent inhibitors reducing the activity of coronavirus based on the human N7-MTase can be identified.",

            "text": "in addition to coronavirus, the development of a fully automated anti-parasitic drug-screening yeast system has been reported, which allows for multiple parasite targets to be assessed simultaneously due to the expression of different fluorescent proteins in the yeast strain. compounds that specifically target parasite enzymes can be selected through this assay, rather than their host counterparts, thus enabling the early elimination of compounds that carry potential side effects (29) . in this system, compounds that cannot discriminate between the host and parasite enzymes are excluded by including a strain expressing the human target in the multiplexed screen. The advantages of this type of assay include the use of known targets and the lack of requirement for in vitro culture of parasites. rapid yeast-based assays can also be established for screening active drugs against human inherited mitochondrial diseases affecting aTP synthase, in particular ataxia, neuropathy and retinitis pigmentosa syndrome (30) . The unique ability of yeast to survive without the production of aTP by oxidative phosphorylation was used to identify chlorhexidine by screening a chemical library and oleate through a candidate approach (30) . Furthermore, the high-throughput yeast-based screening bioassays have also been used to detect selective oestrogen receptor modulators and selective androgen receptor (ar) modulators (31) , to screen commercial chemical libraries to identify Pde7 inhibitors (32) , to robustly identify new lead compounds targeting specific enzymes and to detect the toxicity of human ca isozyme ii (hcaii) inhibitors (33) , which can be achieved using a multidrug-sensitive derivative of the \u0394nce103 strain expressing a low level of hcaii. Finally, the use of yeast present the advantage that it is a relevant surrogate model for eukaryotic cell processes that can be miniaturised and automated.",

For instance, a miniaturised short-term in vivo genotoxicity screening assay based on genetically modified S. cerevisiae was performed to explore the chronic cytotoxicity and genotoxic effect of compounds in a eukaryotic organism (34). in another example, an efficient and reliable yeast-based detection system was created to evaluate the androgenic activity of endocrine disruptors from pulp and paper mill effluents (35) . This system used S. cerevisiae transformed Figure 4 . overview schematic of the required time frame of newly developed yeast-based and cell-based assays for potential growth inhibitor screening. The yeast-based assay requires 6 days to complete, whereas cell-based tests typically require >7 days. with \u03b2-galactosidase genes, and the reporter expression was driven by human ar and response elements, in order to identify compounds that altered the reporter gene induction by testosterone. The findings of the assay suggested that the pulp and paper mill effluents are rich in androgenic chemicals, and this detection system could be applicable as a primary screening method for inhibitors/activators of ar functions (35) . S. cerevisiae has also been used to screen for polymorphisms of human genes, such as heat shock protein 90, which is essential for cell proliferation in budding yeast (36) . Speed and low cost make yeast-based assays a useful tool for identifying human polymorphisms and proteins. in addition, a sensitive, fast and user-friendly progesterone receptor (Pr) transactivation assay was established using recombinant S. cerevisiae that was modified to express green fluorescent protein driven by human Pr and progesterone response element (37) . Stimulation of cells with increasing concentrations of progesterone resulted in a significant elevation in fluorescence activity, and this yeast-based bioassay provided a robust and rapid method for high-throughput screening of (anti)-progestative compounds from various sources. another S. cerevisiae model system has also been used to investigate the regulation of human BraFV600e (38) . under osmotic stress conditions, hBraFV600e can rescue the growth of strains carrying a double or triple mitogen-activated protein kinase deletion in high osmolarity glycerol. The results of this previous study demonstrated the potential of using S. cerevisiae to investigate hBraFV600e, identify its functional interactors and, in doing so, uncover new cancer-associated genes with therapeutic potential. in brief, live yeast cell-based assays are rapid, inexpensive, sensitive and amenable to high-throughput methods that can be used for a variety of applications, including isolation of novel genes, directed evolution and gene-specific drug screening, and will facilitate various approaches in numerous research areas.",

Cell density of glutamate-treated SMD1168H and its recombinant forms. as shown in Fig. 2d, SMd1168H treated with 100 \u00b5M glutamate exhibited a significantly higher cell density of 1.316 units at 24 h compared with at 12 h. The cell density of the glutamate-treated SMd1168H reached an optimum level of 1.511 units at ~36 h (P<0.01) and was maintained at approximately this level until 72 h of cultivation. The cell densities were 1.551 units (P<0.01), 1.520 units (P<0.01) and 1.600 units (P<0.01) at 48, 60 and 72 h of cultivation, respectively. Similarly, in the glutamate-treated SMd1168H-pPicZ\u03b1a, the growth of the yeast reached 1.351 units at 24 h (P<0.05) and an optimum level at 1.492 units at 36 h of cultivation (P<0.05), and the cells continuously grew at this level until 72 h of cultivation (Fig. 2e). The cell densities were 1.545 units (P<0.01), 1.520 units (P<0.01) and 1.546 units (P<0.01) at 48, 60 and 72 h, respectively. However, the growth profile of the glutamate-treated SMd1168H-ToPoi was not observed to be as expected. The recombinant yeast grew steadily during the early cultivation, and the cell densities were 1.280 units (P<0.05), 1.288 units (P<0.05) and 1.446 units (P<0.05) at 24, 36 and 48 h of cultivation, respectively (Fig. 2F).

The cell density was significantly increased at 24 h (1.502 units; P<0.01), reaching an optimum growth level of 1.888 units at 36 h (P<0.001) and then reduced to 1.717 units at 48 h (P<0.01). The cell density reached the lowest level of 0.747 units at 72 h (P<0.05), which was lower than the minimal level observed for normal SMd1168H. This phenomenon may be due to the transformation of the plasmid vector into the yeast, causing the cells to be more fragile. By contrast, a different growth curve was observed when the SMd1168H was transformed with the pPicZ\u03b1a plasmid carrying the ToPoi gene (SMd1168H-ToPoi). a significantly higher cell density was observed at 24 h (1.692 units; P<0.01), 36 h (1.851 units; P<0.001) and 48 h (1.953 units; P<0.001) of cultivation, and the yeast growth remained high at later time points",
