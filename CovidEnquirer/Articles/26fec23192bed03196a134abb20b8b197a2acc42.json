Dysfunctional microglial responses are thought to worsen CNS diseases; nevertheless, their impact during neuroinflammatory processes remains largely obscure. Here, using a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing and multicolour flow cytometry, we comprehensively profile microglia in the brain of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-injected mice. By excluding the contribution of other immune CNS-resident and peripheral cells, we show that microglia isolated from LPS-injected mice display a global downregulation of their homeostatic signature together with an upregulation of inflammatory genes. Notably, we identify distinct microglial activated profiles under inflammatory conditions, which greatly differ from neurodegenerative disease-associated profiles. These results provide insights into microglial heterogeneity and establish a resource for the identification of specific phenotypes in CNS disorders, such as neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases.",

            "text": "The healthy brain hosts distinct and specialized populations of tissue-resident macrophages strategically placed in the parenchyma, perivascular spaces, meninges and choroid plexus where they coordinate homeostatic and immune surveillance functions [1] . As the only parenchymal-resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), microglia act as critical effectors and regulators of changes in the CNS during development and adult homeostasis. Their ontogeny, together with the absence of turnover from the periphery and the exceptional environment of the CNS, makes microglia a unique immune cell population [2] . By sensing any disruption of CNS homeostasis, microglia rapidly change their gene expression programmes and functional profiles. Recent genome-wide transcriptional studies revealed a unique molecular signature selectively expressed in homeostatic microglia [3] [4] [5] [6] that is lost in disease and during ageing [4, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Microglia coordinate immune responses between the periphery and the CNS as they perceive and propagate inflammatory signals initiated outside the CNS [18] . A multitude of signals received from the CNS environment as well as from the periphery induce microglial responses towards phenotypes that ultimately may support or harm neuronal health [2, 19] . Although neuroinflammation and its associated immune responses are often linked to neurodegeneration, the inflammatory response per se provides a primary, transient and self-limiting defence mechanism, by which harmful stimuli are resolved and tissue damage is repaired [20] . Disruption of CNS homeostasis, neuronal deterioration and inflammation are common pathophysiological features of several neurodegenerative diseases. In this context, chronic inflammation is likely to be triggered by abnormal protein deposition, by signals elicited by injured neurons and synapses or by impaired pro-and anti-inflammatory regulatory mechanisms that ultimately exacerbate the neurodegenerative process [21] . Dysfunctional microglial responses are believed to worsen CNS diseases [22] ; nevertheless, their impact during the neuroinflammatory processes remains largely obscure.",

LPS is a well-known immunostimulant used to mimic inflammatory and infectious conditions inducing immune responses associated with sickness behaviour in mice and humans [33, 34] . Notably, it has been shown that repeated peripheral injections of LPS in mice induce neurodegeneration, while a single-dose injection of LPS induces acute inflammatory, but not neurodegenerative processes [35] .

To characterize microglia close to their proper environment, mouse brains were mechanically dissociated into single-cell suspension with all the steps performed at 4\u00b0C [36] . Since microglia in the mouse brain represent only 10% of the cells, CD11b + CD45 int microglia were purified from other CNS and immune cells, including CD11b + CD45 high macrophages and CD11b \u00c0 CD45 high lymphocytes, by FACS, as described previously (Figs 1A and EV1) [37] . To verify accurate microglial enrichment, we compared gene expression levels of specific CNS cell type markers between RNA extracted from unsorted total brain cells and CD11b + CD45 int sorted microglia (Fig 1B) . We analysed the expression levels of microglial homeostatic genes (Olfml3, Fcrls, Tmem119, Siglech, Gpr34, P2ry12) as well as astrocytic (Gfap, Gjb6, Ntsr2, Aldh1l1), oligodendrocytic (Mobp, Mog, Cldn11) and neuronal (Tubb3, Vglut1, NeuN) markers. As expected, microglial markers were highly expressed in CD11b + CD45 int sorted cells, whereas astrocytic, oligodendrocytic and neuronal markers were undetectable or detectable at background levels (Figs 1B and EV1). We next investigated whether CD11b + CD45 int population contained resident non-parenchymal macrophages, such as perivascular macrophages. This was inferred using CD206 as an additional marker for resident macrophages [38] . Under homeostatic conditions, CD11b + CD45 int microglia contained only 0.04 AE 0.02% CD206 + cells, while CD11b + CD45 high cells contained 24.7 AE 3.8% CD206 + resident macrophages (Fig 1C and D) . Similar results were obtained for the dendritic cell marker CD11c and the monocytic markers Ly6C and CCR2 (Fig EV1) . Taken together, these results show that our approach highly discriminates pure and not activated microglial populations from other resident CNS cells.",

B Analysis of relative transcript levels of CD11b + CD45 int FACS-sorted microglia compared with whole brain tissue by qPCR. Gene expression levels of microglia (Olfml3, Fcrls, Tmem119, Siglech, Gpr34, P2ry12), astrocyte (Gfap, Gjb6, Ntsr2, Aldh1l1), oligodendrocyte (Mobp, Mog, Cldn1) and neuron (Tubb3, Vglut1, NeuN) markers. Bars represent mean (n = 4; pool of one female and one male per biological replicate) of relative expression (Gapdh as housekeeping gene) AE SEM (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01 by two-tailed Student's t-test to the corresponding cells isolated from saline-injected control mice by qPCR. In agreement with previous studies [32, 41] , the expression levels of homeostatic (e.g. Olfml3, Fcrls, Tmem119, Siglech, Gpr34, P2ry12, Mef2c), phagocytic (Tyrobp and Trem2) and anti-inflammatory genes (e.g. Mrc1 and Arg1) were highly decreased in microglia isolated from LPS-injected mice compared to untreated mice, while the classical pro-inflammatory genes (e.g. Il1b, Tnf and Ccl2) were markedly increased (Figs 2A and EV2) . Notably, it has been recently shown that signals from the CNS microenvironment have considerable influence in shaping, maintaining and reinforcing microglial identity by regulating expression and establishing distinct chromatin landscapes surrounding enhancer regions [42] [43] [44] . Changes in chromatin remodelers associate with changes in the expression of nearby genes. Specifically, MEF2C binding sites were shown to be over-enriched in enhancer regions of microglial-specific genes [42] and the loss of MEF2C was associated with priming of microglia [45] . In line with these observations, Mef2c expression levels were highly decreased in microglia isolated from LPS-injected mice compared to na\u00efve mice. We verified that this signature is microglia-specific, and it is not affected by LPS-activated immune peripheral cells, such as lymphocytes (CD11b \u00c0 CD45 high cells) and peripheral monocytes/macrophages (CD11b + CD45 high cells), as no significant differences were detected between cellular populations present in brains of salineand LPS-injected mice (Figs 2B and EV2). Importantly, CD11b + CD45 int FACS-gated cells contained very rare (< 0.25%) Ly6C + putative monocytes and (< 0.1%) CD206 + putative resident macrophages ( Fig 2C) . Also, the expression of monocytic markers Ly6c1 and Ccr2 was very low in CD11b + CD45 int microglia compared to bone marrow-isolated monocytes with no significant differences under LPS exposure (Figs 2D and EV2). In order to further assess that the decrease in the homeostatic signature under inflammatory conditions is not due to the presence of other immune cell types, but it is an intrinsic property of microglial cells, we also analysed the effect of LPS on cultivated microglial from adult and neonatal mice. As expected, the expression level of the homeostatic genes was markedly decreased in cultivated cells when compared to acutely isolated microglia ( Fig EV2) [5] . Thus, we cultivated adult microglia in the presence of TGF-b (50 lg/ml) and M-CSF (10 ng/ ml) or neonatal cells with TGF-b 24 h prior treatment with LPS to induce the expression of the homeostatic genes, although at a lower extent than in ex vivo isolated cells (Fig EV2) . Cells treated with LPS (1 ng/ml) for 6 h showed a dramatic decrease of the expression levels of the homeostatic gene markers, such as Olfml3, Tmem119 and Gpr34, accompanied by enhanced expression levels of inflammatory marker genes, such as Il1b, Tnf and Ccl2 both in adult and in neonatal microglia when compared to cells treated with TGF-b only (Fig 2E) . In the healthy brain, TGF-b is expressed at low levels by both neurons and glial cells [46, 47] , while its expression is increased upon injury [48, 49] , hypoxia-ischaemia [50] and neurodegeneration [51, 52] . SMAD and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins are key signal transducers and transcription factors controlling TGF-b downstream signalling [53] . Specifically, STAT3 and suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3) regulate inflammatory responses [54] . The binding of SOCS3 to both JAK kinase and the cytokine receptor results in the inhibition of STAT3 activation. In our analysis, microglial cells treated with LPS showed increased amounts of STAT3 phosphorylation along with upregulation of Socs3 expression levels compared to untreated cells (Appendix Fig S1) . Taking advantage of the \"harmonizome\" collection of databases [55] , we attested that more than 1/3 of the top 100 sensome genes [4] possess STAT3-binding sites in their promoter region. Hence, we hypothesized that the SOCS3-STAT3 antagonistic signalling may be responsible for the suppression of the homeostatic microglia signature and the concomitant shift towards the inflammatory profile [56] .",

For this purpose, FACS-sorted CD11b + CD45 int cells from saline-or LPSinjected mice were analysed using the recently developed highthroughput droplet-based Drop-seq method [23] . In Drop-seq, single cells and functionalized barcoded beads as cell identifiers are co-encapsulated into droplets followed by cDNA synthesis, amplification, library preparation and next-generation sequencing. First, we sought for differentially expressed genes between all LPS and all na\u00efve/saline cells using MAST [57] . We identified 2,405 differentially expressed genes between these two conditions with a false discovery rate (FDR) cut-off of 5% (Dataset EV1) and exemplified the top 100 differentially expressed genes in a heatmap ( Fig 3A) . Second, principal component analysis followed by twodimensional t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (2D-tSNE) of the overall gene expression data of 1,247 analysed cells identified two main cell clusters that were independent of the 2D-tSNE parameters and library sizes (Appendix Fig S2) . Microglia isolated from LPS-injected mice distinctly clustered from the corresponding steady state microglia presenting discrete gene expression signatures ( Fig 3B; Dataset EV1 ). Intriguingly, we noticed from both analyses that, although most of the activated cells clustered together, a small group of cells assembled closer to the control cells, thus highlighting the existence of potential subpopulations under inflammatory conditions, which we characterized later. Gene set enrichment analysis (GO) of upregulated genes in microglia isolated from LPS-injected mice using DAVID [58, 59] uncovered significant involvement (P < 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u00c09 ) in \"translation\", \"protein folding\", \"ribosome biogenesis\" and \"immune system process\", thus reflecting highly activated cells. On the other hand, GO of the corresponding downregulated genes identified, among others, significant enrichment (P < 4.9 \u00d7 10 \u00c05 ) in \"regulation of transforming growth factor beta receptor signalling pathway\", thus reflecting that TGF-b signalling is among the most affected pathways in microglia exposed to LPS (Appendix Fig S3) . In line with gene expression results obtained at the bulk level, microglial homeostatic genes (e.g. Tmem119, Mef2c, P2ry13, P2ry12, Siglech) were among the top downregulated genes and classical pro-inflammatory genes (e.g. Ccl2, Gpr84, Nfkbia) were mainly upregulated also at the single-cell level (Appendix Fig S2) . We further investigated individual gene expressions at single-cell level using 2D-tSNE to show specific homeostatic and inflammatory gene expression levels. For example, Tmem119, Siglech and P2ry12 genes were consistently expressed under steady state, but were downregulated in microglia isolated from LPS-injected mice, while Ccl2 and Gpr84 were largely upregulated in most of the cells exposed to LPS compared to saline conditions ( Fig 3C; Appendix Fig S4) . Notably, a prominent decrease in TMEM119 and P2RY12 expression was further confirmed at the protein level by flow cytometry (Fig 3D) .",

            "text": "Although microglial activation is a common hallmark under inflammatory and neurodegenerative conditions [22] , microglia transcriptional signatures have been shown to be different. For example, Chiu et al [16] demonstrated that acutely isolated microglia from the SOD1 G93A mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) differed from LPS-activated microglia, defining an ALSspecific phenotype. Following the recent description of a novel disease-associated microglial (DAM) phenotype identified under neurodegenerative conditions at single-cell resolution [14] , we here compared our inflammatory-associated microglia (IAM) signature to DAM. The scatterplot showing the fold change of genes between microglia isolated from LPS-injected mice (2,405 genes; Dataset EV1) versus DAM (1,660 genes; Dataset EV2) compared to homeostatic microglia (FDR < 0.05) disclosed 1,826 unique genes affected by the LPS treatment (e.g. Tnf, Irf1), 1,081 distinct genes in DAM (e.g. Itgax, Axl) and 579 shared genes between the two populations (e.g. Gpr84, Tmem119), thus highlighting that these cells mainly display a unique expression profile ( Fig EV3) . Specifically, only 215 upregulated genes (12.1%) and 364 downregulated genes (21.2%) were shared between the two groups ( Fig EV3) . Gene set enrichment analysis (GO) and identification of key genes being discriminative between inflammatory microglia and DAM revealed a high inflammatory reactivity upon LPS treatment and a phagocytic/lysosomal gene signature in DAM (Fig EV3) . For instances, Trem2 and Tyrobp expression levels were highly decreased in IAM, whereas an elevation of both genes was reported in DAM. TREM2 associates with the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-containing adaptor protein TYROBP (DAP12), in which signalling involves the recruitment of tyrosine kinase Syk that further phosphorylates downstream pathways inducing cell activation. TREM2 is required for phagocytosis of apoptotic neurons, microglial proliferation and survival [56, [60] [61] [62] . These subtle differences in perceiving different signals induced by CNS perturbations support the microglial critical role in modulating specific functional activities. In fact, it is intuitive to consider that sensing inflammatory environments to maintain a homeostatic neuronal network (e.g. through the expression of Clec4a and Clec5a genes that are exclusively upregulated in our dataset) or recognizing and clearing pathogenic factors (e.g. by expressing Clec7a/Dectin-1 in DAM), such as b-amyloid aggregates in AD, require distinct activated phenotypes. In a different context, it has been recently shown that myelin pieces are gradually released from ageing myelin sheaths and are subsequently cleared by microglia [63] . Age-related myelin fragmentation is substantial, leading to lysosomal storage and contributing to microglial senescence and immune dysfunction in ageing [63] . It could be then hypothesized that a similar accentuated mechanism may be encountered by microglia surrounding b-amyloid plaques, which become dystrophic at a late stage of the disease [64] . Interestingly, genes described to be associated with neurological diseases, such as Cd33, Cd9, Sod1, Ctsd, and Hif1a, were also downregulated in our signature in comparison with DAM.",

Thus, we hypothesized that these cells may correspond to a microglial subset that is less sensitive to inflammatory stimuli or a cluster of cells which already partly recovered from their activated state following the prominent proinflammatory immune response. We obtained differentially expressed genes between the \"main LPS\" (Dataset EV3) and the \"subset LPS\" (Dataset EV4) clusters compared to the corresponding control conditions (FDR < 0.05). We represented the top 100 Fig S5) . To elucidate the transcriptional signature of the LPS subgroups, we showed differentially expressed genes between \"main LPS\" and \"subset LPS\" clusters compared to the corresponding control conditions (FDR < 0.05). In line with their activated state, the main pro-inflammatory genes (e.g. Ccl2, Tnf, Irg1, Gpr84) were upregulated ( Fig 4B) and the microglial homeostatic genes (e.g. Siglech, P2ry12, Fcrls, Gpr34) were downregulated in both populations (Fig 4C) , although at a lesser extent in \"subset LPS\", compared to steady state conditions. Investigation of the top differentially expressed genes unique to \"main LPS\" or \"subset LPS\" compared to na\u00efve cells (FDR < 0.05; Log2FC \u2265 3 or Log2FC \u2264 \u00c03; Table 1 ) identified, for example, Manf (a growth factor that promotes neuroprotection and tissue repair [65] ) and C5ar1 among the top upregulated genes in \"main LPS\" and Stab 1 as well as Ash1l (which suppresses the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as IL-6 and TNF [66] ), among the enhanced genes in \"subset LPS\". Downregulated genes were, for example, the homeostatic gene marker Mef2c, which restrains the microglial inflammatory response [45] in \"main LPS\" and genes associated with endosomes/lysosomes in both \"main LPS\" (Maf) and \"subset LPS\" (Lamp1) (Figs 4D and EV4) , thus potentially providing some mechanistic insights regarding the less activated state of \"subset LPS\" compared to the \"main LPS\" cluster. Further analysis of unique differentially expressed genes (FDR < 0.05) characterizing the two LPS subpopulations based on microglial functions and properties showed a dramatic increase in genes associated with the major histocompatibility complex (e.g. H2-D1 and H2-K1) exclusively in the \"main LPS\" group and a decrease in the complement system (e.g. C1qa, C1qb and C1qc) in the \"subset LPS\" group when compared to steady state (Table EV1) . Notably, we characterized membrane markers corresponding to specific genes identified at single-cell resolution by flow cytometry to analyse the expression levels of markers upregulated in both LPS groups (e.g. CD44), only in \"main LPS\" (e.g. CD274) or only in \"subset LPS\" (e.g. NOTCH4). Although three markers used simultaneously did not allow to clearly discriminate the \"subset LPS\" from the \"main LPS\" population, changes in the proportion of markerpositive cells were in line with the scRNA-seq data. Upon LPS treatment, a smaller proportion of NOTCH4-positive cells (saline 5.4%; LPS 18.9%) compared to CD44 (saline 65.2%; LPS 97.5%) and CD274 (saline 48.7%; LPS 88.1%) were detected (Fig EV5) . We confirmed this pattern by immunohistochemistry, showing that NOTCH4-positive cells were evenly distributed throughout the brain, thus indicating that these cells were not associated with a specific brain region (Fig EV5) .",

Since the more subtle differences during the activation process would be dominated by the large differences between na\u00efve and LPS conditions, we applied the branching analysis to the LPS-activated microglia only. This more sensitive analysis revealed nine different states, with the largest difference of \"subset LPS\" to all others, in accordance with the previous tSNE and \"SC3\" analyses. Interestingly, cells assigned to \"subset LPS\" exhibit a dense core, but also a significant number of cells towards the other main clusters (Fig 5A) . Given this more sensitive clustering and corresponding pseudotime analysis, we then investigated the characteristics of \"subset LPS\" with respect to their activation state and their relation with the other states. For this purpose, we plotted the estimated pseudotime of each cell in the state space indicating a delayed activation pattern of \"subset LPS\" (Fig 5B) . Lastly, we investigated inflammatory (e.g. Ccl12, Ccl2, Gpr84) and homeostatic (e.g. Mef2c, P2ry12, Siglech) gene expression profiles in dependence on pseudotime, further indicating the delayed activation state of \"subset LPS\" by smaller pseudotimes (Fig 5C) . By comparing the dynamics of the inflammatory and homeostatic genes along the activation process, we observed that inflammatory genes were upregulated first, while the homeostatic markers were only subsequently downregulated. Thus, \"subset LPS\" may correspond to an intermediate state where the gene expression levels of the inflammatory mediators are increased, but the homeostatic gene markers, such as Mef2c, are still partly preserved. In conclusion, from this analysis, we hypothesized that these cells may correspond to a microglial subpopulation that is less sensitive to inflammatory stimuli.",

Differential expression analysis was performed with MAST [57] . Pvalues were adjusted for multiple testing using false discovery rate (FDR) [72] . Prior to MAST analysis, counts were converted into counts per million and log2-transformed. For subpopulation identification, two approaches were used: (i) based on visual inspection of 2D-tSNE plot, cells were divided into three clusters: one cluster contained almost exclusively cells isolated from control mice, another cluster contained mainly cells harvested from LPS-injected mice, and the last cluster was constituted of a small subset of LPS-derived cells. Clusters were pruned to keep only cells coming from the predominant sample in the group. Comparisons of gene expression between different groups were done with the Kruskal-Wallis H-test. P-values were corrected with FDR [72] ; (ii) each condition was analysed separately with the \"SC3\" package [67] .
