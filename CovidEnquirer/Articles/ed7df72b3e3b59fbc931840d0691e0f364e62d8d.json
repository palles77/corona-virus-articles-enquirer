We aimed to compare selfperceived proficiency of PPE use and objective performance, and identify predictors of low compliance and PPE misuse. Methods: An observational study combined with subjective questionnaires were carried out during a bioterror simulation drill. Forty-two observers evaluated performance under PPE. Mistakes were recorded and graded using a structured observational format and were correlated with the subjective questionnaires and with demographic parameters. Results: One hundred seventy-eight HCWs from community clinics and hospitals were included. The mean self-perceived proficiency was high (6.1 out of 7), mean level of comfort was moderate (4.0 out of 7), and mean objective performance was intermediate (9.5 out of 13). There was no correlation between comfort and objective performance scores. Self-perceived proficiency was in correlation with donning and continuous performance with PPE but not with doffing. Clinic personnel performed better than personnel in hospitals (40.3% vs 67.8% with 3 or more mistakes, respectively; P = .001). Demographic characteristics had no correlation with objective or self-perceived performance. Conclusions: Self-perceived proficiency is a poor predictor of appropriate PPE use. The results suggest poor awareness of the possibility of PPE misuse.",

These measures are stretched to an extreme in the uncommon events of severe contagious diseases outbreaks, which can be the result of a deliberate attack or a natural outbreak. 1, 2 Examples of such outbreaks that occurred since the beginning of the 21st century are the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic, 3 the H5N1 avian influenza, 4 the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, 5 the recent Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak, 6 the novel influenza A H7N9 virus, 3 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus outbreak. 7 HCWs are subject to increased risk of infection during an outbreak, but can be well protected by PPE. Nevertheless, the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic taught us that knowledge and self-reported compliance to recommended PPE use are suboptimal among HCWs. 8 More than 850 confirmed HCW infections were reported from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra-Leone in the recent EVD outbreak with more than 500 reported deaths (see http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/ outbreaks/2014-west-africa/index.html). Three cases of nosocomial transmission among apparently protected HCWs in Spain and the United States heightened concerns among health care professionals and decision makers. 9, 10 Several studies demonstrated that overall adherence to appropriate PPE use while providing care for patients in hospitals was modest, and PPE misuse was frequent. 11, 12 Factors found to be associated with appropriate PPE use were knowledge, training, perception of being afflicted with life-threatening diseases, and personal comfort. 13, 14 Nevertheless, most studies were conducted in a hospital setting and were based on self-reported questionnaires without matched objective observations. 8 Moreover, studies were not conducted in settings of a severe contagious outbreak in which participants need to combine contact, droplet, and airborne precautions.",

Fortytwo fourth-year nursing students observed and evaluated donning, doffing, and continuous performance under PPE in the different health care settings. The observers had no other tasks during the drill, and each trainee was followed by 1 observer. The observers received comprehensive education on PPE use, in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines (see http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/pdf/isolation2007.pdf) using a detailed checklist (Supplementary Table S1 , available on request).

This includes not only medical personnel, but also nonmedical staff within the health care setting, such as managers, administrative staff, and logistics staff. Despite recommendations issued by international organizations dealing with infectious diseases such as the World Health Organization, there is still insufficient evidence to draw conclusions regarding the comparative effectiveness of various types of PPE. 16 It seems clear that even after implementing PPE and other barrier measures during a severe contagious outbreak, there are still cases of transmission. Possible shortcomings include insufficient training and supervision on proper practices such as donning and doffing PPE, with emphasis on safe removal of contaminated clothing, shortage and improper use of PPE, extensive working hours due to shortage of medical personnel, and spread outside the patient care setting. [16] [17] [18] Using adequate PPE during patient care is important to prevent HCW infection, to allow proper patient care, and also to ensure comfort and safety of caregivers, because wearing PPE increases the risk of heat stress and the loss of dexterity. 13, 14, 16 Several studies examined PPE use by nurses; physicians; and other personnel, including students, assistants, laboratory workers, housekeeping, and administrative staff. 16 In most cases these studies were not designed to evaluate proper PPE use, and the depiction of PPE protocol is limited.

Ongoing guidance and monitoring of HCWs through the donning and doffing procedures were implemented in Medicine Sans Frontier Ebola treatment centers. 16, 18 A dedicated person was stationed for guiding the HCWs through each step of PPE removal, regardless of their previous experience. 18 The use of PPE is only 1 factor of infection prevention and other important factors include hand and environmental hygiene. As was shown in our study, these measures were not kept in an acceptable manner, with more than 30% of HCWs not following the hand hygiene protocol as mandated. Another relevant factor is implementing a strong safety climate by HCWs. This was shown to be a powerful tool to promote the appropriate use of PPE, including support for safety programs; communication and feedback about safety; and senior management support for safety, training, and education. 21 We present the results of a thorough examination of PPE use. This unique study takes advantage of an extensive national drill intended to improve and evaluate preparedness for a severe contagious outbreak. This setting allowed real-time observation of a large number of HCWs in both hospitals and outpatient clinics. The drill's scenario necessitated extreme infection control precautions, and therefore allowed evaluation of multiple key tasks, including PPE donning, doffing, prolonged use, and hand hygiene. Based on our findings, self-perceived efficacy of protection among HCWs was high, but was a poor predictor of appropriate PPE use. PPE use was not influenced by subjective discomfort, age, gender, profession, or number of prior lectures. Placard use improved donning and doffing order, but was not followed by the correct use of PPE. Performance in PPE by primary-care HCWs was significantly better than that of tertiary-care staff. Hospital staff are more familiar with PPE, yet this may bring a sense of overconfidence while overlooking small but important details. For the community health clinic staff, this exercise dealt with a more unfamiliar scenario, and they probably paid more attention to details. The results suggest poor awareness to the possibility of PPE misuse, emphasizing the importance of a trained observer while working under PPE in the setting of a severe contagious outbreak.",

Trainees following the placard instructions kept the right order of donning and doffing, but still did not perform it well and PPE breaches were found. This may be the result of the way the placards are built. People usually read only the titles, and do not look thoroughly at the sentences that follow. Using larger fonts and simple illustrations may improve performance. Demonstrations are important, with emphasis on short videos using more accessible tools such as smartphones and social and organizational networks. HCWs should not rely on their self-perception, no matter how experienced they are. Simple measures, such as a mirror, can have an important influence on the way HCWs use PPE. Active observation by a designated staff member who comments on PPE use is imperative. It is important to use motivational factors, such as personal safety.
