Epidemiologic investigation of outbreaks of EVA has shown that the incidence of clinical to subclinical infection can vary from 1.4:1 to 1:6 in mares bred to persistently infected stallions. 39 During the 1984 epidemic in Thoroughbreds in Kentucky, it was estimated that 57% of affected farms had one or two cases of EVA, and only 14% of premises had five or more cases of the disease.'!",

Typical cases of the disease may present with any combination of the following: pyrexia of up to 41\u00b0C (106\u00b0F) that develops after an incubation period of 3 to 14 days (6 to 8 days after venereal exposure) that can be of 2 to 9 days duration; depression and anorexia; leukopenia; limb edema, especially of the hind limbs; stiffness of gait; nasal and lacrimal discharges; conjunctivitis and rhinitis; periorbital/supraorbital edema; mid-ventral edema involving the scrotum and prepuce of the stallion and mammary glands of the mare; urticarial-type rash that may be localized to the sides of the neck or face or generalized over most of the body; and abortion in the mare. Pyrexia and leukopenia are the most consistently observed clinical features of EVA. Less frequently observed signs include respiratory distress, coughing, diarrhea, ataxia, papular eruptions beneath the mucous membrane inside the upper lip, submaxillary lymphadenopathy, and adventitious edematous swelling in the intermandibular space, beneath the sternum, or in the shoulder region. Severity of clinical signs is likely to be greater in very young or very old horses and in debilitated animals. With rare exceptions, horses naturally affected with EVA make uneventful clinical recoveries even in the absence of symptomatic treatment. Mortality in natural cases of the disease is very uncommon and has only been reported infrequently in neonatal foals that succumbed from a fulminating interstitial pneumonia 2 , 41, 49 and in foals up to a few months of age affected with a rapidly progressive pneumoenteric syndrome.!S Abortion due to EAV may occur late in the acute phase or early in the convalescent phase of the infection irrespective of the presence or absence of clinical signs of the disease, 9, 15, 26 Natural or experimental cases of EA V -related abortion have been recorded at anywhere from 3 to over 10 months of gestation. s , 26 In natural outbreaks of the disease, abortion rates have varied significantly from less than 10% to between 50 and 60%Y An abortion rate as high as 71 % was recorded in one experimental study of the transmissibility and abortigenicity of the Kentucky 1984 strain of EAV,s Although still unproven, there is evidence to indicate that perhaps not all strains of this virus are abortigenic,",

Apart from the potential of EA V to cause abortion in mares and, very rarely, fulminating respiratory disease in young foals, mortality does not occur following infection with naturally occurring strains of the virus. This is in sharp contrast, however, to what has been seen in horses challenged with an experimentally derived velogenic variant of the Bucyrus strain of EAV. This experimental variant of the virus can cause up to 60% mortality in adult horses exposed by the respiratory route (McCollum WH, personal communication, 1983 ). Much of the confusion that currently prevails regarding this disease has stemmed from incomplete and misleading descriptions of EV A in some widely referenced texts.",

Recent studies have indicated that based on organization of the viral genome, pattern : of gene expression, and replication strategies, there is a strong likelihood that corona viruses, toroviruses, and arteriviruses are ancestrally related and belong to a coronavirus-like superfamily. 8 The arterivirus genus has now been expanded to include the causal virus of the newly defined disease of swine; porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome,so lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, and simian hemorrhagic fever virus. 36a Only one serotype of EA V has been recognized so far; the prototype Bucyrus strain, notwithstanding evidence of limited antigenic and genomic variation among North American and globally distributed isolates of the virus.'\" 32, 33 Although the information available on variation in pathogenicity between strains of EA V is, as yet, incomplete, it is nonetheless evident that the ability of strains to produce disease can vary greatly, 41 Equine arteritis virus possesses a complement-fixing antigen but no hemagglutinin, It is easily inactivated by lipid solvents and disinfectants, and although relatively thermolabile, can survive for years at low temperatures,",

Five known epidemics of EVA have occurred in the past 40 years, all of them in North America, With the exception of the 1984 epidemic on Thoroughbred breeding farms in Kentucky, all of these occurrences took place at racetracks and were characterized by rapid spread of the virus, with several hundred horses becoming affected in each instance'\"",

The importance of aerosol transmission has been documented in both natural and experimental infections/' 24, 25 and it is very probably the primary route of dissemination of EAV during widespread outbreaks of the disease that occur infrequently at racetracks. Although virus is also shed in vaginal secretions,12, 26 urine,>4, 26, 35 and feces,12,35 during the acute phase of the infection, the amount and duration of virus shedding is greatest via the respiratory tract. EAV can be found in high concentration in respiratory secretions for up to 7 to 14 days, 24 Another potential source of virus is the fetus, placenta, and placental fluids from a mare that has aborted as a result of EA V infection. 5 , 11, 26 It would appear, however, that close or direct contact is required for aerosol transmission to occur from any of the aforementioned sources of infection. 6 ,40 In association with the 1984 epidemic of EVA in Kentucky, it became evident that venereal transmission of EAV also played a very significant role in the spread of the disease. Apart from the potential for dissemination of the virus by this route by both the acutely infected mare and the stallion, venereal transmission by the long-term carrier stallion represents the primary means whereby EA V is maintained in horse populations throughout the world. Such persistently infected stallions appear to shed virus solely by the venereal route and can transmit the infection to 85 to 100% of seronegative mares to which they are bredY Transmission of EA V through indirect contact with virus-contaminated fomites, such as shanks, twitches, apparel, or personnel, is thought to playa minor role in the overall spread of this infection. Though not considered significant in relation to the 1984 epidemic of EVA in Kentucky}' it was suspected, however, to have been of some importance with respect to an outbreak of the disease that occurred in a veterinary teaching hospital.\" Of further potential significance with regard to virus transmission is the role the teaser stallion or nurse mare may play in dissemination of the infection. Analysis of data from the 1984 epidemic in Kentucky could not, however, confirm that either had contributed significantly to spread of the virus on the majority of the farms investigated,\"",

Of primary significance in this regard has been confirmation of the carrier state in the stallion: 6 A relatively high percentage of stallions can become carriers and semen shedders of EA V for a period of months or years after infection with the virus. Initial exposure of such stallions is by aerosol transmission or venereal contact with an acutely infected mare. The potential for establishment of persistent infection in the entire male horse appears to be related to age or, more specifically, to state of reproductive maturity at time of exposure to the virus. Efforts to establish a long-term carrier state in sexually immature colts have been unsuccessfuJ. 16 The carrier stallion provides a source of . EA V through venereal contact with a susceptible mare at the time of natural bFeeding or of artificial insemination with infective semen.41 Establishment of clinical or inapparent infection in the mare would be associated with a period of profuse virus shedding by the respiratory tract. This, in turn, would provide the opportunity for secondary lateral transmission to occur to susceptible in-contact horses either on the stallion breeding farm or farm of origin in respect of mares that are \"vanned in\" to be bred. Evidence in support of this has come from certain outbreaks of EVA that have occurred in recent years. An extensive outbreak of the disease on a major Arabian farm in the United States in 1987 was closely linked to the introduction of a recently imported stallion that was likely a chronic carrier of EA V at the time of importation: 7 Signs of EVA were first observed in the initial group of mares that were artificially bred to this stallion in that breeding season. The stallion never displayed signs of EVA and was strongly seropositive and a semen shedder of the virus when sampled. This was coincidental with detection of the first cases of the disease on the farm.",

The possibility of introducing EA V into a group of susceptible horses can be minimized by isolating all horses returning from other farms, sales, or racetracks for 3 to 4 weeks. If feasible, segregation of pregnant mares from other horses is recommended. In the event of an outbreak of EVA, restriction of movement of breeding stock, selective vaccination, and, as an extreme resort, closure of the breeding sheds have been measures that have been successful in curtailing the spread of the disease among breeding farms : '",

Kentucky and New York are the only two states that have formulated preventive and control programs for their respective Thoroughbred breeding industries:' Both programs are predicated on the unique significance of the carrier stallion in the epidemiology of this disease. This fact and the high frequency of the carrier state in recovered stallions have underscored the importance of identifying carrier animals in any population of breeding stallions and of implementing a policy of annual vaccination of all at-risk breeding stallions at least 28 days before onset of each breeding season. There are several advantages to this strategy, including control over establishment of the carrier state in additional stallions, and preventing possible venereal transmission of EA V in the breeding shed and precluding the need to screen mares entering the breeding shed for evidence of EA V infection. Additionally, all first-season stallions should be checked for presence of the carrier state before the start of each breeding season. Stallions that are confirmed semen shedders and carriers of EA V can continue to be used commercially, subject to certain safeguards being met. Carrier stallions should be kept physically isolated and bred only to mares that are seropositive from previous natural exposure or vaccination or, if seronegative, vaccinated not less than 3 weeks previously. After being bred, recently vaccinated mares should be kept isolated from other seronegative horses for a period of 3 weeks. These measures, when implemented fully, have been successful in preventing occurrences of EVA associated with the use of carrier stallions.",

Equine arteritis virus becomes localized in the reproductive tract of a relatively high percentage of infected stallions which serve as very efficient transmitters of the infection through direct or indirect venereal contact with susceptible mares. The long-term persistently infected stallion appears to playa major epidemiologic role in the dissemination and perpetuation of the virus in horse populations throughout the world.
