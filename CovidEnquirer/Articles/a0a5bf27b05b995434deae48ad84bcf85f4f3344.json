A national survey concluded that only 10% of U.S. hospitals have a pediatric intensive care unit, 25% of hospitals without a pediatric trauma service admit critically injured children, and 7% of hospitals without a pediatric ward admit children. 2 A Canadian study of ED preparedness demonstrated defi ciencies in equipment needed to resuscitate a critically ill pediatric patient. 3 Not all children are, or need to be, seen in a pediatric ED. In fact, of the approximately 35 million pediatric ED visits per year, only 10% seek care initially in a children's hospital/ pediatric ED. What this means is that the other 31.5 million children seek care in general and community EDs, which have varying abilities to care for them. In most community EDs, pediatric patients account for 20% to 35% of the patient visits. This chapter reviews the issues involved in prepared-1080",

It also covered topics such as access, triage, transfer and transport, education, training, research, quality assessment and improvement, administrative support and hospital commitment. 6 This guideline added the requirement that the physician be competent in the care of pediatric emergencies. This could be demonstrated by the successful completion of Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) or Advanced Pediatric Life Support (APLS) courses. 6 This set the foundation for the development of a national policy statement in 2001 (see later). 7 In February 1995, the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) issued a policy statement on pediatric equipment guidelines. These were recommended for equipment of pediatric patients in a general ED. This list included monitoring devices, vascular access supplies and equipment, respiratory equipment and supplies, medications, related supplies/equipment, miscellaneous equipment, specialized pediatric trays, and fracture management devices. 8 The equipment and medications listed in this document and the AAP 1995 document are similar.",

Pediatric Critical Care Center (PCCC) was another category designation that was added. This designation is achieved if a hospital meets requirements for an EDAP, has a trauma center, and has a California Children's Services-approved pediatric intensive care unit. 11 In 2004, there were 57 EDAPs and 9 PCCCs in Los Angeles County. 11 In 2002, the State of Illinois added a section to the Emergency Medical Services and Trauma Center Code to include facility recognition criteria for EDAPs and the Standby Emergency Department Approved for Pediatrics (SEDP). 12, 13 Although this is a voluntary process, since these rules have been in effect the EMSC facility recognition process has recognized 114 (out of a possible 200) hospitals. These criteria cover topics similar to the Los Angeles County criteria, but include recommended equipment lists as well as professional staff (nurse, physician, nurse practitioner, physician assistant) qualifi cations, continuing medical education (CME) requirements, a multidisciplinary QI committee, and a pediatric continuous QI liaison. [12] [13] [14] Another important part of this document was the development of interfacility pediatric trauma and critical care consultation and/or transfer guidelines. 15 ",

It is important to childproof the waiting room by avoiding sharp corners on chairs and tables, locking cabinets, covering electrical outlets, and covering trash cans. 19 If pediatric-size furniture is available, it is important to keep it clean after use.

Additional pediatric QI indicators can include pediatric resuscitations, intubations, and patients admitted to the general pediatric ward who require transfer to a pediatric intensive care unit. More specifi c QI ideas can include timing to administration of antipyretics, or pain assessment and management. 23 It is important to include some out-of-hospital QI indicators such as appropriate airway management (airway adjunct or assisted ventilation), delivery of 100% oxygen to a child in respiratory distress, establishment of vascular access, appropriate immobilization for trauma, and appropriate sized equipment used. The Institute of Health Care Im provement has defi ned the four essential components of a high-performing quality program as follows: (1) focus on identifying appropriate indicators, developing a plan for improvement (plan); (2) implement this plan (do); (3) collect and analyze the data (study); and (4) reach conclusions and make recommendations (act). It is also important to have a multidisciplinary QI team, as different perspectives will be obtained and many lessons learned (see Chapter 149, Patient Safety, Medical Errors, and Quality of Care).",

It is important for the referring physician to consult with the receiving physician, so the appropriate method of transport and the required personnel can be determined.

Included in this policy should be the use of seclusion. When restraint or seclusion is considered, the patient's caregivers should be involved in the treatment decision. If this is not possible, they should be notifi ed. Each use of restraint or seclusion must be based on the patient's needs, age, and past medical history. The restraint policy should cover defi nitions and exceptions to restraints (e.g., intravenous infusion armboards, temporary immobilization for procedures). When restraint or seclusion is utilized, there need to be written orders by a physician, time limits for the written orders, patient assessment parameters (constant visualization, vital signs, nutrition, hydration, and safety every 15 minutes), and a re-evaluation time for renewal of the restraint order. 25 During restraint or seclusion, documentation should include a physician order, completion of a nursing or trained staff form/fl owsheet, notifi cation of the patient's legal guardian, and documentation of monitoring/ vital signs. All staff are required to have ongoing education in the proper use of restraint devices and seclusion techniques, as well as alternative methods for handling behaviors that may lead to the use of restraint or seclusion. The ED medical records of those patients who require restraint or seclusion should be reviewed as part of the department's QI plan.",

This legislation, often referred to as the Comprehensive Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act or \"anti-dumping\" legislation, is included in Title XVII of the Social Security Act. Any hospital that received Medicare funding must comply with these regulations, even for non-Medicare patients. A hospital can be fi ned up to $50,000 per violation, and the hospital's or physicians' Medicare and Medicaid agreements may be terminated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. 33, 34 EMTALA applies when a person comes to a hospital with an ED and requests care for an emergency medical condition. It also applies if a parent is requesting care for his or her child. An emergency medical condition is an illness or injury that manifests itself by acute symptoms requiring immediate attention to avoid placing the health of the person in serious jeopardy. 33 In terms of a woman in labor, this constitutes inadequate time to transfer her prior to delivery. However, the existence of an \"emergency medical condition\" is based upon the defi nition of a prudent layperson, not a health care professional. 33 In order to fulfi ll the EMTALA obligation, a patient must be screened and, if necessary, stabilized. If a patient cannot be stabilized, he or she must be transferred to an appropriate facility, with the receiving facility aware of and accepting the transfer. 33 The ED and hospital should have an EMTALA policy that addresses items such as what constitutes a screening examination, who can perform the screening examination, which parts of the hospital/main campus qualify under EMTALA, and who responds to medical emergencies outside of the ED. 33, 34 A revised aspect of EMTALA is the \"on-call\" requirement. Each hospital must have an on-call schedule and written policies related to the schedule, including response times. This policy applies to emergency physicians as well as medical and surgical specialists 34 (see Chapter 150, Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act [EMTALA]).",

In rare cases, the receiving facility may have no available beds, but can assist the transferring hospital in fi nding another appropriate facility. Before the patient is transferred, there should be physician-to-physician and nurse-to-nurse communication. Written documentation, including consent to transfer, method of transfer, and reason for transfer, should be included. 35 ",

It can also mean that, even after an ill or injured child has been stabilized, there may be no available beds at the pediatric centers. While there are no easy solutions to this problem, utilizing QI indicators to track time on EMS diversion, ED boarding time, ED waiting room time, the number of patients who left without being seen, and the number of times when patients could not be transferred in a timely manner will help those outside the ED realize there is a problem, and help advocate for change.",

Over the last 20 years, the goal of the EMSC program was to assure that children were included in the entire scope of care, including out-of-hospital care, the ED, and hospital care. Many of the policies and programs developed over the past 10 years were the result of this initiative. 7,9,12-15 By being inclusive rather than exclusive, many national organizations have supported the idea of pediatric ED guidelines for preparedness. It is unrealistic to expect that a rural community hospital that lacks pediatric inpatient beds would have the same ED equipment and supplies as a large suburban community hospital with pediatric inpatient beds, or even an urban, freestanding children's hospital. The goal is to provide some ideas, solutions, and examples that will improve the care of children everywhere.",
