By pulse-chase analysis of radiolabeled protein condensation in B-cells, the formation of insoluble aggregates of regulated secretory protein lags behind the conversion of proinsulin to insulin. Condensation occurs within immature granules (IGs), accounting for passive protein sorting as demonstrated by constitutivelike secretion of newly synthesized C-peptide in stoichiometric excess of insulin (Kuliawat, R., and P. Arvan. J. Cell Biol. 1992. 118:521-529). Experimental manipulation of condensation conditions in vivo reveals a direct relationship between sorting of regulated secretory protein and polymer assembly within IGs. By contrast, entry from the trans-Golgi network into IGs does not appear especially selective for regulated secretory proteins. Specifically, in normal islets,",

            "text": "lysosomal enzyme precursors enter the stimulusdependent secretory pathway with comparable efficiency to that of proinsulin. However, within 2 h after synthesis (the same period during which proinsulin processing occurs), newly synthesized hydrolases are fairly efficiently relocated out of the stimulusdependent pathway. In tunicamycin-treated islets, while entry of new lysosomal enzymes into the regulated secretory pathway continues unperturbed, exit of nonglycosylated hydrolases from this pathway does not occur. Consequently, the ultimate targeting of nonglycosylated hydrolases in/S-cells is to storage granules rather than lysosomes. These results implicate a post-Golgi mechanism for the active removal of lysosomal hydrolases away from condensed granule contents during the storage process for regulated secretory proteins. T HE past decade has witnessed considerable debate regarding the mechanism(s) used by specialized neuroendocrine and exocrine cells for sorting polypeptide hormones and other content proteins into storage (secretory) granules. Protein sorting during intracellular transport is well established for newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes, which are recognized by mannose-6-phosphate receptors and conveyed via clathrin-coated vesicles from the TGN to an endosomal compartment, en route to lysosomes (Kornfeld and Mellman, 1989; Trowbridge et al., 1993) . By analogy, the \"sorting for entry\" model of protein targeting to storage granules proposes that through specific mechanisms, regulated secretory proteins (and not other proteins) are selected from the mixed contents of the TGN (Griffiths and Simons, 1986; Orci et al., 1987a; Tooze et al., 1987a; Moore et al., 1989; Tooze and Huttner, 1990 ) and conveyed to immature granules (IGs) ~, the first organelle in the biosynthetic path-way able to undergo stimulus-dependent exocytosis (Arvan et al., 1991; Tooze et al., 1991b) . It has recently been recognized that regulated secretory protein condensation into insoluble aggregates plays a role in the sorting process (Gerdes et al., 1989; Wagner et al., 1991) . Consequently, Huttner and colleagues have hypothesized that sorting receptors in the TGN (Bauerfeind and Huttner, 1993) may direct selected protein aggregates (Chanat and Huttuer, 1991) from TGN to IGs, while denying similar access to nongranule content proteins.",

As an alternative to sorting for entry, the \"sorting by retention\" model proposes the following sequence of events: soluble proteins are largely unsorted upon entry into IGs; receptors mediate efficient vesicular removal of selected molecules from IGs, along with a modest sampling of proteins in the fluid phase (Aryan and Chang, 1987; vonZastrow and Castle, 1987; Arvan et al., 1991) ; while the condensation of regulated secretory proteins favors their efficient retention within IGs (Kuliawat and . Both hypotheses embrace \"sorting domains\" within regulated secretory polypeptides; however, since sorting by retention is accomplished by passive (selfassociating; Arvan and Castle, 1992) rather than active (receptor-binding; Moore et al., 1989) protein interactions, the retention hypothesis predicts that sorting domains may not be highly conserved between different regulated secretory proteins.",

However, there have been no attempts to demonstrate biochemically when and where these insoluble polymers first form. To examine polymer assembly, sedimentation on linear sucrose velocity gradients was examined after solubilization of islet organelle membranes by sonication in a cell lysis buffer including 0.3% Nikkol, 1 mM CaC12, and 500/zM ZnC12 at pH 6.0. Mildly acid conditions are thought to approximate the luminal environment of IGs, as opposed to the more acidic internal pH of mature granules (Orci et al., 1986 (Orci et al., , 1987b ; while calcium and zinc were included because these ions play a role in protein assembly within the/~-granule core (Howell et al., 1978) . Centrifugation speed and time (see Materials and Methods) were adjusted to distinguish polymeric assemblies (hundreds-to-thousands of molecules) from soluble proinsulin hexamers (Grant et al., 1972) that are believed to form within the endoplasmic reticulum (Emdin et al., 1980) . A solubilized insulin standard analyzed by velocity gradient did not exit the load fraction ( Fig. 2 , top gradient). By contrast ~60% of Coomassie-stainable islet insulin penetrated the gradient (Fig. 2 , second gradient). To determine whether the sedimentable insulin represented intact granules or granule cores, we examined the sedimentation of soluble C-peptide which is co-sequestered within/3-granules. Since C-peptide does not stain with Coomassie blue or silver, pulse-labeled islets were first chased overnight to maximize the fraction of labeled insulin and C-peptide stored in mature granules. After cell lysis as described above, the fraction of total radiolabeled insulin which pelleted was also '~60% ( Fig. 2 , third gradient). However, the soluble C-peptide was quantitatively retained in the load fraction ( Fig. 2 , last gradient). These data indicate that granule membranes were in- deed disrupted (Michael et al., 1987) . We conclude that although the vigorous sonication procedure does cause a partial solubilization of granule insulin, the sedimentable \"GC fraction\" (Fig. 2 ) exhibits the behavior expected of polymeric assemblies of granule core protein.",

This elevated \"C/I ratio\" serves as a convenient assay that reflects the solubility of C-peptide vs. insolubility of insulin, altering their relative probability for departure from IGs in budding vesicles (Kuliawat and Aryan, 1992) . A moderately acidic pH is though to make an important contribution to the environment favoring intragranular conversion of proinsulin to C-peptide and insulin (Orci et al., 1986 (Orci et al., , 1987b as well as to the subsequent condensation of insulin (Michael et al., 1987) . Cellular exposure to 200 #M chloroquine, an agent which raises the pH inside acidic organeUes, perturbs the storage of proteins normally targeted to secretory granules and enhances secretion by a pathway that exhibits constitutive characteristics (Moore et al., 1983 ) (although these studies were controversial because the dose, 200 /~M, and several hour duration of chloroquine exposure caused other effects such as profound inhibition of prohormone processing [Mains and May, 1988] ). These earlier studies led us to reconsider whether it might be possible to selectively manipulate the efficiency of insulin polymer assembly in vivo without disturbing prohormone processing. Two maneuvers were attempted for this purpose. First, exposure to chloroquine (100 #M) was re-examined, except that importantly, the period of islet exposure was delayed until well after pulse-labeling was completed (60-120 min of chase). This modification allowed unperturbed intracellular conversion of newly synthesized proinsulin to insulin. Thus under these conditions, effects of chloroquine could not be ascribed to sorting for entry, since the arrival of proinsulin in IGs (as measured by processing to insulin) was quantitatively unaffected. Nevertheless, polymeric assembly of nascent insulin to the sedimentable GC fraction was reduced markedly (Fig. 4 A) . Further, the 60-120-min chase medium from chloroquine-treated islets contained an increased amount of newly synthesized insulin while C-peptide enrichment over insulin was eliminated (i.e., C/I ratio = 1.0, see Fig. 5 ). These data suggest that by inhibiting insulin condensation, the two polypeptides were no longer spatially segregated within the IG lumen, so that sorting between them could no longer take place.",

The absolute magnitude of the stimulus-dependent secretion (i.e., stimulated minus control) of procathepsin B varied between experiments, resulting in a large standard deviation (Table I) . Nevertheless, between different pairs as well as by overall averaging, the stimulus-dependent fraction of labeled procathepsin B tended to parallel the regulated exocytosis of proinsulin/ insulin (Table I) . This regulated secretory behavior suggested that the secretion of cathepsin B precursor originated from IGs. Since procathepsin B enters the stimulus-dependent secretory pathway nearly as efficiently as proinsulin (which enters IGs with >99% efficiency; , the present data suggest that hydrolase precursors enter the IG compartment in great abundance. While one could conceive of the possibility that stimulated secretion of newly synthesized hydrolases might originate from endosomes or endosome-derived vesicles rather than IGs, this secretion was not at all diminished even when lysosomal enzyme traffic to endosomes was markedly inhibited-moreover, it was Figure 6 . Entry of cathepsin B precursor into the regulated secretory pathway of pancreatic/S-cells. (A) Following pulse-radiolabeling of pancreatic islets and either 20 min, 60 min, or overnight chase, a l-h period of unstimulated (3.5 mM glucose) or near-maximally stimulated secretion was collected. The chase media and islet lysates were then analyzed by immunoprecipitation for both proinsulin plus insulin, and cathepsin B. Prolonged secretory collection helped to minimize effects of differences in ER exit rates for proinsulin and cathepsin B. In the experiment shown, the stimulus-dependent release of labeled (pro)insulin present in islets at each chase time averaged 17.3 %, which was not inhibited as the chase progressed. By contrast, the stimulus-dependent fraction of cathepsin B precursor, which was 73 % of the stimulus-dependent fraction of proinsulin secreted from 20-80 min, declined rapidly as a function of chase time. A \"o39-kD precursor (upper arrow) was the only form secreted into the medium, while a \"o35-kD form (lower arrow) accumulated in a nonsecretory compartment, presumably lysosomes. Representative data are shown from one of nine such experiments (see Table I ). (B) After tunicamycin exposure, islets were labeled as in A and chased 45 min before the secretion period. A \"o34-kD nonglycosylated cathepsin B precursor (asterisk) exhibited regulated exocytotic discharge. Islets were isolated and recovered overnight as described in Materials and Methods. Each preparation of islets was radiolabeled and divided into pairs of approximately equal numbers. The islets were chased \"~30 rain before an additional 60-min collection from unstimulated or stimulated islets. The media and cell lysates were each analyzed by immunoprecipitation using an anti-insulin serum as well as an antiserum to cathepsin B. The fraction (%) of labeled cathepsin B secreted into the medium corresponded exclusively to the precursor form (Fig. 6) and was quantita~l either by phosphorimaging or scanning densitometry after SDS-PAGE and fluorography. The data shown repesent the mean value from nine such pairs (+standard deviation).",

Cathepsin D (~54 kD) and cathepsin L (,,o40 kD) were specifically immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. The data from a representative experiment (of three) are shown. most hydrolases en route to lysosomes bind mannose-6phosphate (M6P) receptors in the TGN and are relocated via clathrin-coated vesicles to an endosomal compartment (Kornfeld and Mellman, 1989; Trowbridge et al., 1993) . Thus, it seemed possible that hydrolase precursors could be sorted for entry into/3-cell IGs based on M6P recognition, as has been hypothesized in cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Griffiths and Isaaz, 1993) . To test this possibility, we wished to block N-linked carbohydrate addition to new lysosomal enzymes and thereby prevent the formation of M6P recognition signals. Unlike for more complicated glycoproteins, nonglycosylation of biosynthesized lysosomal enzymes (either after mutagenesis or after tunicamycin treatment) does not induce detectable misfolding nor block the ability of these enzymes to bind and ultimately cleave (Smith et al., 1989; Kane, 1993) Steer. 1993.

To examine whether the M6P moiety might play a role in the ability of hydrolase precursors to be removed from IGs, pancreatic islets treated with tunicamycin were labeled and chased overnight to allow newly synthesized proteins to reach their final destinations. At this time, cathepsin B from control islets shows a mobility shift upon SDS-PAGE after digestion with endoglycosidase F, while from tunicamycintreated islets there was no shift upon digestion, confirming an absence of N-linked glycans (Fig. 9 A) .",

Lysosomal enzyme entry into IGs is independent of a mamaose-6-phosphate recognition signal. Pulselabeled islets, untreated or pre-treated with tunicamycin, were chased briefly before a 60-min collection of unstimulated or stimulated secretion, as in Fig. 6 . Newly synthesized cathepsin L was specifically immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. In each set of islets, the stimulus-dependent fraction of glycosylated (,040 kD) or nonglycosylated (,o37.5 kD) cathepsin L actually exceeded the stimulus-dependent fraction of labeled proinsulin, which ranged from 18.4-21.3 % in this experiment. Thus, both forms of cathepsin L behaved as virtually perfect markers for entry into IGs. The data from a representative experiment (of three) are shown. markably, however, there was a dramatic stimulus-dependent exocytosis of nonglycosylated cathepsin B (~,40% in the experiment of Fig. 9 B) , indicating that in f3-cells, the nonglycosylated lysosomal enzyme was unable to traffic out of the stimulus-dependent secretory pathway. Stimulated secretion of the labeled protein after such a long chase time is consistent with residence of the nonglycosylated hydrolase in storage granules, but is not compatible with protein trafficking through the constitutive secretory pathway or endosomes. Thus, we conclude that without alteration of primary sequence, simple removal of carbohydrate was sufficient to change the ultimate targeting of cathepsin B from lysosomes to storage granules.",

Two current models of targeting to storage granules (sorting for entry [Bauerfeind and Huttner, 1993] and sorting by retention [Kuliawat and Aryan, 1992] ) differ in whether the condensation of regulated secretory proteins need or need not occur prior to protein entry into IGs. Understanding where condensation first occurs is crucial because if a large number of molecules enter IGs in the soluble phase, then it is difficult to conceive of a sorting mechanism that could prevent other soluble proteins (including nonsecretory proteins) from entering IGs as well. This if of minor concern in most cell culture models of regulated secretion, where the fraction of volume that flows from the TGN into IGs is modest relative to other TGN exit routes (i.e., the constitutive secretory pathway, and clathrin-coated vesicle traffic to endosomes). However,/3-cells of pancreatic islets, like many other regulated secretory tissues in vivo, produce an abundant population of storage granules, which represents a significant fraction of the entire cell volume. In these cells, a large majority of volume flowing through the TGN must enter directly into IGs, while the constitutive secretory pathway is likely to be diminutive by comparison. In this case, the question becomes whether soluble nonsecretory proteins can avoid the IG compartment.",

Postulates concerning the formation of insoluble protein aggregates in the TGN (Chanat and Huttner, 1991) do not seem applicable to proinsulin, which requires efficient proteolytic conversion to insulin after entry into IGs (Orci et al., 1987b; Davidson et al., 1988; Huang and Arvan, 1994) . Nevertheless, until now, no biochemical investigations have been made concerning the condensation of proinsulin (or other regulated proteins) while in transit through the intracellular secretory pathway. Using a sedimentation assay, we observed that assembly of regulated secretory protein polymers began shortly after the first appearance of insulin and accumulated progressively thereafter (Fig. 3) . The data strongly suggest that in islet B-cells, insulin rather than proinsulin is primarily responsible for the formation of the nascent ~-granule core, and IGs serve as the site of this assembly. Thus, we propose that proinsulin enters IGs in the soluble phase in pancreatic B-cells. These data are entirely consistent with earlier biophysical studies indicating that randomly coiled C-peptides interfere with close-packing of soluble proinsulin hexamers (Steiner, 1973; Weiss et al., 1990) , thereby rendering proinsulin incapable of forming large, insoluble complexes in an aqueous environment above pH 3 (Fullerton et al., 1970; Grant et al., 1972) . While we do not preclude the possibility that some proteins in some cell types might undergo complex Figure 9 . Nonglycosylated cathepsin B is converted from a lysosomal enzyme to a permanent resident of the regulated secretory pathway in pancreatic /3-cells. Pulselabeled islets, untreated or pre-treated with tunicamycin, were chased overnight before a 60-min collection of unstimulated or stimulated secretion. Tunicamycin pretreatment did not inhibit the stimulus-dependent secretion of labeled insulin, which averaged \"040 % in this experiment.

By contrast, both ,034 plus ,031-kD nonglycosylated forms (arrows) exhibited regulated exocytosis, suggesting that the smaller form was generated by proteolysis within the secretory pathway. The data shown are from a representative experiment (of three). formation in the TGN (or earlier) and might even be conveyed to granules by binding to the luminal aspect of the membrane of forming IGs, it seems clear that many regulated secretory proteins may not require the formation of insoluble complexes before entry (see preceding paragraph). Specifically, while TGN-based condensation could be used as a sorting mechanism for the granins in PC12 cells (Chanat and Huttner, 1991; Pimplikar and Hutmer, 1992) , we note that even in these cells, recent evidence suggests that the IG is an important sorting compartment (Grimes and Kelly, 1992) as appears to be the case in AtT-20 cells (Milgram et al., 1994) . For the reasons described above, in \"real\" regulated secretory tissues, the importance of IG-based sorting is likely to be considerably greater than in these cell culture systems.",

            "text": "If condensation within IGs plays an important role in regulated secretory protein sorting by retention, a mechanism must exist in which other proteins can be removed from the IG compartment. Constitutive-like vesicle budding, which corresponds kinetically to the period shortly after IGs detach from the TGN, was initially discovered in highly granulated tissues as part of a secretory pathway conveying a small fraction of granule content proteins under basal conditions (Arvan and Castle, 1987; Arvan and Chang, 1987; vonZastrow and Castle, 1987) . To date, not all of the vesicular transport steps in this pathway have been mapped. Nevertheless, there is reason to believe that initial steps of this pathway involve clathrin-coated vesicles which travel from IGs to endosomes, from which some of the transported cargo is regurgitated to the cell surface (Aryan and Castle, 1992) . The constitutive-like vesicles departing from IGs sample a modest fraction of fluid contents enriched in soluble components, accounting ultimately for the unstimulated secretion of newly synthesized C-peptide in stoichiometric excess of insulin (Kuliawat and Arvan, 1992) . The fact that the intraluminal environment of IGs can be experimentally manipulated ( Fig. 4) has provided a handle by which to explore the interplay between protein condensation and protein storage within granules, or removal therefrom (Fig. 5) . Although the data is pharmacological in nature, a picture emerges that while solubility of proinsulin does not interfere with massive entry into IGs, the insolubility of insulin plays an important role in enhancing the efficiency of its targeting to storage granules. These results are consistent with, and may help to explain, older studies analyzing the effect of weak bases on storage granule formation and maturation (Moore et al., 1983; vonZastrow et al., 1989) . Moreover, Carroll et al. (1988) have described transgenic mice in which two-thirds of the islet insulin is a mutant that exhibits defective oligomerization with zinc and hence defective condensation. In these/3-cells, most secretory granules were morphologically deficient in forming the dense core; and isolated islets exhibited \"unregulated\" secretion consistent with excessive traffic of uncondensed proteins through the constitutive-like pathway. Thus, we conclude that both the nature of the secretory proteins as well as the intraluminal IG environment play a significant role in enhancing the efficiency of protein storage in regulated secretory granules.",

In the jr-cells of mouse pancreatic islets, the distributions of mature lysosomal enzymes overlap little with storage granules (Figs. 6-8); nevertheless, lysosomal enzyme precursors enter the stimulus-dependent secretory pathway. While one might postulate that release of lysosomal enzyme precursors could derive from a stimulated endosomal compartment rather than from IGs, the fact that tunicamycin treatment (which interferes with the traffic of newly synthesized hydrolases to endosomes) does not inhibit stimulus-dependent hydrolase secretion (Figs. 6 and 8) effectively eliminates this possibility. Moreover, the persistence of stimulated secretion of nonglycosylated hydrolases after overnight chase (Fig. 9) is incompatible with stimulated hydrolase secretion via the constitutive secretory pathway. In addition, cell fractionation studies have previously demonstrated that procathepsin B is found in isolated/S-granules while mature cathepsin B is found exclusively in a lysosome fraction (Docherty et al., 1984) . Taken together, these data indicate that the stimulusdependent secretion of lysosomal enzyme precursors derives predominantly if not exclusively from the regulated secretory pathway. Finally, because the absence of N-linked glycosylation does not reduce the stimulatable fraction, the entrance of lysosomal hydrolases into ~-cell IGs must not require the M6P moiety.",

While various possibilities might theoretically account for the behavior of lysosomal enzymes in /~-cells, the simplest and likeliest explanation is that most newly synthesized hydrolases bypass the TGN and enter IGs because they are soluble, and a major fraction of volume in the intracellular transport pathway flows into IGs in these ceils. Nevertheless, the fact that lysosomal enzymes may use bulk flow to gain entrance into IGs should not be considered mis-sorting. Rather, the data indicate a temporary residence of these precursors in B-cell IGs as part of the normal transit of hydrolases en route to lysosomes (Fig. 6) .",

In fact, for most (although perhaps not all) cell types, the preponderance of lysosomal enzymes not sorted via the M6P signal recognition pathway probably represent the best protein markers available to define how unsorted proteins will travel in the soluble secretory pathway (von Figura et al., 1979; Rosenfeld et al., 1982; Nishimura et al., 1988a,b; Rindler and Traber, 1988; Kane, 1993) .

In parallel tubes, a series of sedimentation standards (albumin, ~5 S; catalase, '~11 S; thyroglobulin, '~17 S; large ribosomal subunits '~60 S; intact influenza virions, *700 S) were used to calibrate the gradients according to the sketch shown at top. Gradient fractions were analyzed by tricine-urea-SDS-PAGE (in which insulin bands typically have a curvilinear appearance) and then digitized and printed after flatbed scanning (minor linear artifacts in printing of the figure do not affect calculations from these data). As shown, the gradient does not create aggregates in vitro but does preserve ~60% of granule insulin in a polymerized state.
