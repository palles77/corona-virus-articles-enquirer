Specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the SARS-CoV are vital for early diagnosis and pathological studies of SARS. Direct intrasplenic inoculation of plasmid DNA encoding antigen is an effective and fast approach to generate specific mAb when the protein antigen is difficult to prepare or dangerous in use. In this study, we selected one fragment of SARS-CoV spike protein (S1-3 ) as antigenic determinant by immunoinformatics. Single intrasplenic immunization of plasmid DNA encoding S1-3 induced anti-spike protein antibodies. We established one hybridoma cell line secreting specific mAb and evaluated this mAb with murine leukemia virus pseudotyped with SARS-CoV spike protein (MLV/SARS-CoV). The mAb could recognize the spike protein on the MLV/SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells albeit with no neutralizing effect on the infectivity of the pseudotype virus. Our results show that a single-shot intrasplenic DNA immunization is efficient for the production of specific mAb against SARS spike protein, and a linear epitope of the spike protein is recognized in this study.",

Etiologic analysis has identified a novel coronavirus named the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [2] . SARS-CoV spike protein, the major determinant of pathogenesis and the main target of protective immunity response, is composed of two non-covalently associated S1 and S2 domains [3] [4] [5] [6] . The N-terminal S1 domain is responsible for viral attachment with the cellular receptors, and the membrane-spanning fragment S2 domain takes part in the host cell entry and the infected cell-cell fusion. Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the functional receptor for SARS-CoV, and a neutralizing human monoclonal antibody 80R against ACE2 can block the binding of S1 domain to sensitive Vero E6 cells [7] . The ACE2-binding domain locates within the Nterminal residues 318-510 aa of spike protein, which has a higher affinity to ACE2 than the full S1 domain (residues 12-672 aa) [8] .",

The spike protein on SARS-CoV plays a crucial role in viral entry into the host cells, and therefore becomes the major target of neutralizing antibodies preparation. Specificity of monoclonal antibodies to the SARS-CoV spike protein makes them important for the early diagnosis, viral pathogenesis studies and vaccine development. Under specialized biosafety facilities, purified SARS-CoV viral lysates with high infectious potential are most commonly used as immunogens for anti-SARS antibodies preparation [5, 16] . Two recent reports have developed DNA vaccine with SARS N protein and truncated spike protein, which are shown to induce specific antibody and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) generation by two or three times intramuscular DNA immunization in several months [17, 18] . Here, we developed a mAb against SARS-CoV by a single-shot intrasplenic immunization of plasmid DNA encoding one fragment of ACE2-binding domain in the spike protein in a short time. Instead of hazardous wild-type SARS-CoV, chimeric MLV/SARS-CoV pseudotype virus was used to characterize this mAb.",

Plasmid DNA encoding S1-3 was injected directly into the spleen of BALB/c mice to trigger immunological reaction. The antisera were analyzed with an ELISA plate coated with synthetic polypeptides or SARS-CoV lysates. In our preliminary experiment, all intra-spleen immunized mice showed positive immune response from day 5, and the sera titer peaked as 1:10 4 at day 7, much faster than protein or intramuscular DNA immunization. Therefore, we performed the hybridoma fusion 7 days after intra-spleen injection of pcDNA-S1- 3 . Some investigations demonstrated that it was possible to obtain good hybridoma production within a very short immunization time and irrespective of the antibody response of the intrasplenic immunized animal [10, 12] . The antibody responses of immunized mice were crucially determined by the expression of antigen in transfected spleen cells, which was concerned with the natural trait of the encoding antigen and the expression vector used. In the 24 hybridoma clones, 3E8 was subcloned and the mAb was determined as IgM isotype. Culture supernatants and ascites of 3E8 recognized synthetic S1-3 polypeptide specifically in ELISA assay. We also established mAb against SARS-CoV nucleoprotein (N protein) by singleshot intrasplenic inoculation of plasmid encoding an epitope (residues 20-49 aa) of N protein. Specific anti-N antibodies could be detected in mice at day 5 with ELISA kit coated with synthetic N protein fragment or SARS-CoV lysates (data not shown). These data suggested that S1-3 in the spike protein and fragment of N protein were potent epitopes, and single intrasplenic injection of eukaryotic expression plasmid coding antigens is efficient to induce specific antibodies in a short time, much faster than the protein or intramuscular DNA immunization.",
