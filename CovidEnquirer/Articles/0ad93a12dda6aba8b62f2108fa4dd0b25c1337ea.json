Using a nonlinear model based on monthly data of Taiwan's import prices from 1981 to 2008, we find that the degree of exchange rate pass-through is increasing in deflation. The increase becomes smaller when the price of oil is excluded. Evidence for pass-through increasing in deflation has not previously been found in the existing literature and presents a new understanding of the pricing behavior of firms. Poor profits in deflation cause firms to pass through most of the cost of exchange rate changes to their products to avoid exiting the market. (C.-S. Wu). 1 In Taylor (2000), higher exchange rate pass-through results from persistent cost changes under high inflation, based on a staggered price setting model. As firms set prices several periods in advance, their prices are more responsive to cost increases if cost changes are perceived to be more persistent. According to the US data provided in the paper, regimes with higher inflation tend to have more persistent costs such that higher inflation increases the degree of exchange rate pass-through.",

            "text": "Differences in the degree of exchange rate pass-through were attributed to microeconomic factors until Taylor (2000) first suggested that inflation has a positive impact on the degree of pass-through exhibited by firms. 1 Additional studies have also found evidence of a positive relationship between these two variables (Bouakez & Rebei, 2008; Choudhri & Hakura, 2006; Gagnon & Ihrig, 2004; Mar\u00eda-Dolores, 2010) . A consensus emerges from the studies focused on this relationship; high inflation increases the degree of exchange rate pass-through, and conversely, low inflation decreases it. However, the data that these studies define as low inflation include both low positive and negative inflation rates. That is, there are some cases of deflation. Deflation in the importing country typically threatens foreign firms' profits through weak domestic demand and falling prices. Because their profits are severely reduced, foreign firms become more vulnerable to cost fluctuations. Any cost changes, including those due to exchange rate movements, are easily reflected in their products. Under the law of one price, the import price is also affected. Exchange rate pass-through, which describes the extent to which import prices respond to exchange rate changes, thus becomes higher. This obviously contradicts the results of existing studies. We infer that the increased exchange rate pass-through is likely to emerge when deflation occurs in the importing country. The initial assumption that there is a positive relationship between lower pass-through and lower inflation, including deflation, may not hold. Therefore, this paper is designed to draw out this particular effect, re-examining the relationship between the exchange rate pass-through and inflation by incorporating the case of deflation.",

For example, Gagnon and Ihrig (2004) distinguish periods of high and low inflations for 20 industrial countries to test the hypothesis that decreased exchange rate pass-through is the result of an inflation-stabilizing policy; Choudhri and Hakura (2006) sort 71 countries into low to high inflation groups to explore the relationship between the pass-through to Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the inflation environment; Bouakez and Rebei (2008) estimate the pass-through in Canada for relatively low and high inflation levels. These studies all demonstrate that pass-through is lower when inflation decreases. This positive relationship is supported by the empirical analysis, which is typically performed for two regimes: low and high inflation. Because no specific attention is paid to the impact of deflation, pass-through in a deflation regime tends to be considered the same way as that of a low inflation regime. Therefore, this may lead to biased results. In view of the mixed impacts of low inflation, this paper intends to reinforce the role of deflation and clarify its influence on pass-through. Using data from Taiwan, a more detailed analysis of pass-through is provided by also considering the case of deflation. These pass-through estimates are discussed separately, not only in different inflation regimes but also in a deflation regime.",

            "text": "The Taiwanese data contains information that is useful for an investigation of pass-through in three regimes (including both inflation and deflation) because it exhibits the following features. From 1989 to 1997, Taiwan experienced rapid economic growth due to a thriving high-tech industry. The CPI inflation rates, as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1 , were above 3% during this prosperous period. After 1997, the Asian financial crisis caused a slowdown in domestic economic growth. In the years that followed, the burst of the internet bubble and the terrorist attacks in the U.S. also influenced Taiwan's economy. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2001 further dampened the domestic economy. During these years, Taiwan's CPI inflation rate became negative and continued to decline. The core CPI also exhibited a negative growth rate of \u22120.61% in 2003. According to Rogoff et al. (2003) ), Taiwan was one of the countries at risk of worsening deflation. Weak domestic demand put the island's economy on a path toward recession. Based on these characteristics in Taiwan's economic data, we are able to examine the degree of exchange rate pass-through in a deflation environment and for different levels of inflation.",

            "text": "Because this study hypothesizes that there is a nonlinear relationship between the degree of exchange rate pass-through and inflation, the threshold model proposed by Tsay (1998) is applied in this paper. 2 The data employed are from 1981 to 2008. In examining these data, we note that oil prices usually fluctuate much more than the prices of other imports. Marazzi and Sheets (2007) , Sekine (2006) , and Campa and Goldberg (2005) all find that oil prices impact estimations of the degree of passthrough. 3 For this reason, we also apply a non-oil import price index to the model. 4 To provide a basis for comparison, we first run the model and estimate the degrees of exchange rate pass-through only considering two regimes, in which the inflation rate is either above or below 3%. The results show that a positive relationship exists and that pass-through decreases with inflation, which is consistent with existing studies. Then we extend the model to clearly distinguish a deflation regime from a low inflation regime. Here, we adopt the suggestion in Rogoff et al. (2003) that deflation occurs when the inflation rate is less than 1% rather than 0%. Rogoff et al. (2003) suggests that there is bias in the measurements of the CPI such that when the measured inflation is less than 1%, this likely indicates deflation. It is therefore more appropriate to define deflation as an inflation rate below 1%. 5 By estimating the pass-through for clearly defined deflation, low positive inflation and high inflation regimes, we find that the degree of pass-through does not always decrease with the inflation rate. There is a pattern of increasing pass-through in deflation regimes. This finding is very different from the general view of a positive relationship between pass-through and inflation that results from the two-regime model used in related papers. Instead of consistently finding lower pass-through for lower inflation rates, in Taiwan, the pass-through becomes inversely greater as the inflation rate falls into a deflation regime. That the passthrough is higher in a deflation regime is especially obvious after the 1997 financial crisis. Conversely, the lowest degree of pass-through are found in the clearly defined low positive inflation regime; that is, our analysis, contrary to what a positive relationship would predict, does not find an unlimited downward trend in the pass-through. There is a rebound in the degree of passthrough once deflation is clearly identified. In other words, as an inflation environment becomes one of deflation, firms are found to be less willing to bear the exchange rate costs, resulting in a higher degree of pass-through. The pass-through appears to be higher in a deflation regime. At the end of the empirical analysis, robustness checks are performed to examine these results.",

            "text": "Model (6) clearly describes the central theme of this paper. The degree of exchange rate pass-through is analyzed in three regimes. Here, the low positive inflation regime indicates low but positive inflation rates, which do not include deflation. High inflation, low positive inflation and deflation are defined as inflation rates of more than 3%, between 1 and 3%, and less than 1%, respectively. Through this three-regime TAR, we are able to obtain the pure effect that deflation has on exchange rate pass-through. Table 4 reports the OLS estimates from model (6). Two sets of coefficients are estimated, one for all import goods and another for non-oil import goods. Model characteristics, such as sample size, R-squared, F-tests and a test for the presence of autocorrelation in the residuals, are displayed at the bottom of the table. The long-term effects of these variables are consistent with the theoretical predictions. 11 The cumulative exchange rate pass-through is measured by the sum of the coefficients \u03b2 i . Before discussing the model's estimated results for the degree of exchange rate pass-through, the coefficients on the domestic price level changes (\u0394p t d ) in Table 4 provide related information and merit attention. Examining the estimated results for the deflation regime in Table 4 , the coefficients on the domestic price changes (\u0394p t d ) in the short-run are smaller and not significant, indicating that foreign firms do not match changes in the importing countries' prices. In the long-run, the coefficients become larger but are still not significant, suggesting that the price-taking behavior of foreign firms weakens in a deflation regime. 12 As deflation occurs, the importing market is less competitive because of its weak domestic demand. Foreign firms react less to their competitors' price level in the importing market when setting their export prices. Smaller responses to the competitive price in the importing country are made by foreign firms. According to theory, a lower magnitude of the competitive price level implies that most of the costs from changes in the exchange rate would be passed through. Therefore, the coefficients on \u0394p t d primarily predict that there would be a greater exchange rate pass-through in a deflation regime. We now proceed to examine the results for the degree of exchange rate pass-through. Table 5 presents the long-run exchange rate pass-through from the OLS estimates presented in Table 4 . This table provides the main results of this paper. Notably, the pass-through estimates show greater values in deflation and high inflation regimes. Approximately 60-70% of the change in the exchange rate is reflected in the import price for these two regimes, while only 20-50% is passed through in the low positive inflation regime. As the previous section shows, the finding that higher pass-through is correlated with higher inflation remains 11 We check the long-run effect of each variable through the sum of its contemporaneous and lagged coefficients. 12 Long-run effects are measured by \u03b3(1)/(1 \u2212 \u03c1), where \u03b3(1) is the sum of current and lagged coefficients on the domestic price level changes (\u0394p t d ). the same. The increasing pass-through in the deflation regime, however, sheds new light on the connection between exchange rate pass-through and the initial low inflation regime. According to previous studies, the exchange rate pass-through is expected to decrease as inflation continues to fall due to the positive relationship that has been found for many countries. 13 The results of our model, however, indicate that although the degree of pass-through is higher in high inflation regimes and decreases with a falling inflation rate, this pattern does not persist once the inflation rate has fallen enough to be considered deflation. From the results of the three-regime TAR, the decreasing trend stops and then reverses. The degree of the exchange rate pass-through is v-shaped. Higher degrees of pass-through are possible in a deflation regime.",

Profits would increase, and this would enhance firms' capabilities for dealing with cost shocks. Having a more flexible profit margin apparently enables firms to rely less on pass-through. Therefore, in a low positive inflation regime, import prices respond less to exchange rate fluctuations. In contrast, when an economy undergoes deflation, the implication is that the overall economic conditions are becoming worse, as is demand. Suffering from a continued decline in selling prices, the profit margin on sales to the importing country is severely reduced; this leaves little space for firms to accommodate any cost changes. 14 Consequently, the costs resulting from exchange rate changes are largely reflected in the prices of imports; thus, a greater degree of exchange rate pass-through occurs in a deflation regime.",

This also implies that a higher degree of pass-through can be found in deflation, whether the threshold values are exogenous or endogenous to the model. 17 The above results of Tables 7 and 8 show the increasing pass-through in deflation that are reported in this study. Although some of the estimated pass-through rates for the sub-samples are not empirically persuasive due to the limited sample size, the robustness checks performed on the data for the whole period all show higher pass-through rates in deflation. Therefore, we conclude that the observed results are robust under these checks.",

In contrast to the existing literature, our results indicate that the degree of exchange rate pass-through is v-shaped across regimes. The pass-through not only increases with positive inflation but also with deflation. The increasing trend for the latter is observed once deflation is clearly identified. If deflation is not separated from the broadly defined low inflation regime, a biased result may arise, and the degree of passthrough will be inaccurate.",
