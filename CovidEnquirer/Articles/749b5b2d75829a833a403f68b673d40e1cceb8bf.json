Methods: The risk of transmission of MERS-CoV infection to healthcare workers (HCWs) was assessed in an outbreak in Riyadh. All HCWs with unprotected exposure to confirmed cases were tested after 24 h of exposure. Two negative results for MERS-CoV obtained 3 days apart and being free of any suggestive signs and symptoms were used to end the isolation of the HCWs and allow their return to duty. Results: Overall 17 out of 879 HCWS with different levels of exposure tested positive for MERS-CoV. Of the 15 positive HCWS with adequate follow-up, 40% (6/15 HCWs) tested positive on the first sampling and 53% (8/15) tested positive on the second sampling. The time to negative results among the 15 positive HCWs ranged between 4 and 47 days (average 14.5 days) and the infected HCWs needed on average two samples for clearance. All positive HCWs were either asymptomatic or had mild disease.",

The activities undertaken by the infected HCWs ranged from mild exposure, e.g., exposure during routine nursing care, being in the same clinical area, or just having a simple peer conversation, to more high-risk exposure, e.g., intubation and connecting infected patients on bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP).

The infection control community continues to be challenged by the lack of updated evidence-based infection control guidelines for handling HCWs in contact with cases positive for MERS-CoV. Some of the key questions include: (1) Which of the exposed HCWs are at risk of acquiring MERS-CoV and need to be tested? (2) What exposure justifies testing? (3) Should asymptomatic contacts be screened? (4) Are asymptomatic positive HCWs infectious? (5) How many samples need to be taken for confirmation of positivity and clearance and how many days apart? (6) How long should HCWs be quarantined and when is it safe for them to return to active duty? Although many reports of hospital outbreaks have been published to date, very few have discussed these key infection control questions in any detail. This is why national and international guidance on managing exposed HCWs has been inconsistent and sometimes confusing to the professional infection control community. The latest available guidance from the Saudi Ministry of Health published in 2017 still discourages the testing of asymptomatic HCWs and allows only one sample from HCWs who have had high-risk exposure to be cleared (Command and Control Center Ministry of Health Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Scientific Advisory Board, 2017). Similarly, the latest US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance published in 2015 discourages the testing of asymptomatic contacts (CDC, 2015) .",

Clearance is bound by the following conditions, which are almost impossible to comply with and monitor in a healthcare facility with an ongoing MERS-CoV outbreak: there should be good infection control infrastructure in the facility, HCWs should not work in areas with patients at risk of MERS-CoV infection complications, and all positive HCWs should be monitored by repeat PCR testing for virus clearance and for compliance with good infection control practices, including wearing masks when within 1 meter of others (HCWS or patients). This component of the guidance needs to be revised based on the recent evidence showing possible transmission from asymptomatic PCR-positive HCWs, which could put patients and other HCWs at unnecessary risk if the conditions mentioned in the WHO document are not strictly applied and monitored (Alfaraj et al., 2018b) .",
