The tissue samples of liver, kidney and spleen were taken from specific-pathogen-free (SPF) cats that were inoculated intranasally with 103 TCIDso of FIPV 79-1146 (n= 10), FIPV UCD1 (n=3) or sham inoculum (n = 3), from clinical cats (n = 43), and from formalin-fixed archived feline tissues (n = 49), respectively. Additional tissue samples were taken from the FIPV-inoculated cats (n = 6) and were kept at 4\u00b0C, room temperatures (20-24\u00b0C) and 370(2 respectively for 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours before frozen ( -70\u00b0C) for PCR to evaluate the effects of the ambient temperatures and post-mortem intervals on the test. The samples were also fixed in 10% neutrally buffered formalin, 95% ethanol, and Bouin's solution respectively to evaluate the effects of the fixatives on the test.",

Of the 92 clinical cats, 7 of the 8 FIP-suspected cats (87.5%) and 51 of the 84 non-FIP-suspected cats (60.7%) were shown to be virus-positive in at least one of the tissue samples. There was no significant difference in the PCR results between the fresh and the formalin-fixed tissues of the clinical cats (P > 0.05). Of the FIPV inoculated cats, the virus was detectable equally well in fresh and formalin-, Bouin's solution-or ethanol-fixed tissues. However, the amounts of total RNA extracted from the fixed tissues were significantly less than those from fresh tissues (P < 0.01 ). In tissues that were kept at 4\u00b0C, the virus was detectable up to 96 h; at room temperatures, up to 48 h; and at 370C, up to 24 h, respectively. 0378-I 135/94/$07 00 \u00a9 1994 Elsevier Science B.V All fights reserved SSDI0378-1 135 (94)00043-V",

Some feline coronaviruses, especially feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), cause important diseases in feline species, and present considerable challenges to feline practitioners and diagnosticians. The disease associated with coronavirus infection in cats was first described 30 years ago and the virus was observed ultrastructurally 5 years later (Holzworth, 1963 , Zook et al., 1968 . Since then, many attempts have been made to develop a reliable clinical method and/or laboratory test to diagnose the disease and to detect the virus-carrier cats (Barlough, 1984 , Barlough and Stoddart, 1990 , Hok, 1989 , Hok, 1990 , Martinez and Weiss, 1993 , Pedersen, 1987 , Sparkes et al., 1991 .",

First of all, the clinical occurrence (less than 5-10%) of the disease is much lower than that of inapparent viral infection in cats (Evermann et al., 1991 , Pedersen, 1987 , Scott, 1989 , Scott, 1991 . Second, the disease spectrum varies greatly and the clinical or pathological manifestations of the virus infection can be similar to and confused by those of many other diseases in cats (August, 1984 , Barlough and Stoddart, 1990 , McKeirnan et al., 1981 , Pedersen, 1987 . Third, certain strains of feline coronaviruses do not grow in conventional culture systems and viral isolation is a difficult task (Barlough and Stoddart, 1990, Pedersen, 1987) . Fourth, there exist biological and antigenic diversities of feline coronaviruses and host antibody response varies greatly (McKeirnan et al., 198 I, Pedersen, 1987 , Tupper et al., 1987 . Lastly, co-infection of feline coronaviruses with other infectious pathogens often occurs in cats (Pedersen, 1987 , Rodgers and Baldwin, 1990 , Sparkes et al., 1991 .",

The hyper-immune serum was obtained from a specific-pathogen-free (SPF) cat that was inoculated with FIPV-1146, and diluted I: 1000 in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA-PBS) as the primary antibody. The fluorescein-conjugated goat-anti-cat antibody was supplied by Sigma (St. Louis, MO), and diluted 1:50 in 0.5% BSA-PBS as the secondary antibody. SPF cats (Cornell Feline Health Center, CFHC, Ithaca, NY) were kept in filter-isolation cages, one cat per cage, at 16 weeks of age. After adaptation for one week, the cats were inoculated intranasally with 0.5 ml of 103 TCIDso FIPV-1146 (n= 10), FIPV-UCD1 (n = 3), or sham inoculum (n = 3) respectively. When the infected cats developed clinical signs of FIP, they were anesthetized with Ketamine subcutaneously and euthanized with barbiturate fluid intracardially for necropsy. Clinical cats (n = 42) were randomly selected at necropsy from the Veterinary Pathology Service (VPS) and/or CFHC at Cornell University (Table 1) . A pilot study with the FIPV-infected cats and clinical cats (n= 10) indicated that FIPV was most frequently detected from the liver, kidney and spleen samples among others (e.g., blood, pancreas, heart, brain, cecal apex, mesenteric lymph nodes, conjunctiva, lung, and parotid gland). At necropsy, the tissue samples ( 1 gram/sample) of liver, kidney and spleen were taken randomly from each cat, quenched in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70\u00b0C for viral RNA extraction. One liver biopsy was taken from a kitten that was referred to the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital at Cornell University because of the hydropericardium and a family history of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). The liver biopsy sample was processed as above for viral RNA extraction. Additionally, liver, kidney and spleen samples of 49 cats were taken from the VPS archival tissues fixed in 10% neutrally buffered formalin ( < 1 year's duration) for viral RNA extraction (Table 1) . Additional tissue samples of liver, kidney and spleen were taken from the FIPV-1146inoculated SPF cats (n=6) and kept at 4\u00b0C, room temperatures (20-24\u00b0C) and 37\u00b0C respectively for 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, before quenched in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70\u00b0C, to evaluate the effects of the ambient temperatures and post-mortem intervals on the PCR test. The tissue samples were also fixed in 10% neutrally buffered formalin, 95% ethanol, and Bouin's solution respectively to evaluate the effects of the fixatives on the PCR test.",

The results of slot hybridization, Southern hybridization, IFA, and the sizes and nucleotide sequences of the PCR products, all indicated that the PCR test was specific for the FIPV-1146 S gene. The S gene is highly conserved among feline and other coronaviruses, and therefore we designed the primers to span a region of this gene so that most, if not all, of the feline coronaviruses in cells and tissues could be detected. On the other hand, the 6b gene of the feline and other coronaviruses is the least conserved (De Groot et at., 1988 , Vennema et al., 1992 . Our next study is to differentiate each strain (at least major strain) of feline coronavtrus infections in cats by PCR with primers that span the 6b gene (Fig. 1 ) . By combination of the two different sets of primers, feline coronaviruses in cells or tissues could be both detected and differentiated simultaneously by a single PCR test.",

The currently used clinical methods and/or laboratory tests can not be linked to feline coronaviruses themselves in cats and are often not useful in subclinical viral infections. The history, clinical signs, clinical chemistry, and hematological findings often are not specific, and the manifestations of many diseases in cats can be similar in these aspects (August, 1984 , Barlough and Stoddart, 1990 , Pedersen, 1987 , Scott, 1989 . A diagnosis based on the commonly used histopathologic examination often results in a wide range of differential diagnoses, especially for the \"dry form\" of FIP (Barlough and Stoddart, 1990 , Pedersen, 1987 , Rodgers and Baldwin, 1990 , Scott, 1989 , Sparkes et al., 1991 . Serum antibody response in cats does not correlate directly to the coronavirus infections. Some cats may not develop antibody response to coronavirus infection and serum antibody disappears in some terminally ill cats (Barlough and Stoddart, 1990, Sparkes et al., 1991) . In kittens, it is often uncertain whether the presence of serum antibody is due to maternal immunity or acquired infection (Addie and Jarrett, 1990, Addie and Garde, 1992) . On the other hand, the PCR test does not correlate to the severity, progression and prognosis of the virus infections at the time of testing.",

The PCR results were positive for all 13 FIPV-infected cats, whereas the results of slot hybridization were positive for only 2 of the 10 FIPVinfected cats in this study. A dot blot hybridization assay has been described recently to detect feline coronaviruses in cell cultures and fehne peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (Martinez and Weiss, 1993) . The assay can detect the viruses themselves during the acute viremic infection, but not during chronic infection. It is very difficult to isolate the virus from cats with clinical FIP, since some feline coronaviruses do not grow well in the conventional culture systems (Barlough and Stoddart, 1990, Pedersen, 1987) . It is thus practically impossible to use the viral isolation method in routine diagnoses or surveys of coronavirus infections in cats. Since the PCR test detects only a specific segment of viral genome, e.g. 688 nucleotldes out of the whole coronavirus genome in this study, PCR results could be positive as long as this specific segment is intact, even if the whole viral particle and/or genome had been disintegrated.",

The peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes and conjunctival swabs could be considered as the tissue sample of choice for a non-invasive PCR diagnostic test or viral survey in cats. However, the virus may not be present simultaneously in every tissues or homogenously within a given tissue. Another advantage of the PCR test is the flexibility of sample handing, i.e. the preservation and shipping of the tissue samples. The tissue samples appeared to be good for the PCR test if, after death or biopsy, the cat tissues were kept at 4\u00b0C for up to 96 h, at room temperatures for up to 48 h, and at 37\u00b0C for up to 24 h. Alternatively, the tissue samples could be fixed in 10% formalin, ethanol, or Bouin's solution, although tissue fixation would decrease the amount of viral RNA extraction from the tissues.
