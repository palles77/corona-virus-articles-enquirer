In this context, the concept set forth in 1983 by the World Bank that absence of health is the main obstacle to economic development in poor countries has placed vaccination as the first action for the economic improvement of less-developed countries [3] . Likewise, the World Health Organisation (WHO) together with UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund) launched in 1981 a global campaign of immunisation (Expanded Programme of Immunisation, EPI) to vaccinate 80% of children world-wide with five basic vaccines (against polio, diphtheria, measles, pertussis, tetanus). The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) was founded in January 2000, to unify public and private efforts towards enlarging vaccine availability particularly in less-developed countries. The financial body of GAVI, the Vaccine Fund, has received excellent support through private donations (up to US$ 1.1 billion), including a contribution of US$ 750 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Furthermore, during the World Economic Forum held in Davos in January 2003, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has announced a further contribution of US$ 200 million to establish the \"Grand Challenges in Global Health\" initiative, to support and accelerate research and vaccine development for AIDS, malaria, diarrhoeal diseases and other infections affecting the most impoverished countries.",

In fact, the economic value of vaccines is negligible from the industrial viewpoint, where its potential business amounts to only about 2% of the global pharmaceutical market [4] . Other problems that make the vaccine business unattractive for companies include the high risk of liability actions, the pressing requests from humanitarian organisations for decreasing vaccine prices, the recalcitrant attitude of some public health administrations to meet the vaccine costs to the full coverage of the population. As a consequence, the number of industries producing and manufacturing vaccines has dramatically dropped in recent years. In the USA, vaccine companies have decreased from 37 in 1967 to 10, bringing about a significant shortage in vaccine supply that would expose the population to the risks of uncontrolled outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases [2, 5, 6] . Even more dramatic would be the situation in less-developed countries, where vaccine coverage is most needed.",

The programmes of GAVI and other similar programmes need to be paralleled by a clear policy towards encouraging industrial involvement in vaccine research, development and manufacturing. Incentives for industrial research and investments in the vaccine field should be devised, such as de-taxation policies, insurances against liability risks, more attractive patent coverage, waiving the pressure of public-sector agencies (the principal buyers of vaccines) for lowering the vaccine price. Without genuine involvement of vaccine companies, no social or humanitarian effort towards vaccination in less-developed countries could be hoped to be successful.",

If the problem is true for developed countries, it is greatly exacerbated in the poorest countries that do not have the financial capacity of meeting the cost of vaccines. However, decreasing vaccine price for these countries does not offer a reasonable solution, as price could always be too high for them, and companies are increasingly discouraged in maintaining the vaccine business. Moreover, vaccines developed and tested in developed countries might need to be adapted to the widely different geographical conditions and infrastructure present in other countries. To make some simple examples, vaccines that need to be conserved at +4 \u2022 C may pose insurmountable difficulties of distribution in sub-equatorial countries, vaccines that need multiple administrations will face problems of compliance, injectable vaccines will pose the problem of supply of sterile syringes and or their safe disposal to avoid spreading of infections, oral or nasal vaccines will face problems of proper absorption in populations stricken by diarrhoeal and lung diseases with generalised mucosal inflammation and abundant mucus secretion.",

From the point of view of more basic research, the enthusiastic availability of funding from charities and private organisations makes possible to invest also in areas considered of low priority in developed countries. This is the case of the International Vaccine Institute (IVI), an international organisation located in South Korea, that relies upon a substantial funding received from GAVI for running top-level basic research and epidemiological studies on vaccines for diarrhoeal diseases (e.g. Shigella, rotaviruses), and for running a large training programme for Asian countries such as Bangladesh, China, India, Pakistan, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam [7] . Again, the main problem is not that of devising an effective new vaccine, but that of adequate vaccine manufacturing and of proper vaccine distribution and administration. From this point of view, there is a tendency by international organisations of supporting the independent development of vaccine production and distribution in each country. This is an issue that further bothers vaccine companies, as they fear unforeseen competition risks with little possibility of enforcing their patent rights without raising strong public reaction and risking a generalised damage to their business. However, this does not appear as a consistent or imminent risk for companies. Indeed, implementation of independent vaccine production in less-developed countries will need a more basic and long-term strategy in supporting the social and economic development of the country.",

Although apparently of little immediate practical outcome, the establishment of higher education programmes in these countries and the formation of a class of young independent scientists is the basis for any future social and economic development. Specific training and technology transfer will be needed in order to implement independent vaccine manufacturing and distribution. In this sense, the involvement of vaccine companies, on the basis of international cooperation and licensing agreements, would be of great importance. Other initiatives, as that of IVI, are moving in this direction by establishing facilities for small-scale vaccine production devoted to training of third-world personnel and technology transfer.",

In its programme for action \"Accelerated action on HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in the context of poverty reduction\" [9] , the EU Commission provided a broad policy framework for a comprehensive global and multidisciplinary approach against the three poverty-linked diseases.",

Thus, the first defensive activities take place at the mucosal surfaces, to avoid adhesion of micro-organisms to the cell surface (cilial movement, mucus secretion). The epithelial cells also express defence receptors (e.g. the Toll-like receptors, TLR) that recognise and bind specific pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMP) and initiate defensive cell activation. Epithelial cells can synthesise and secrete a wide array of anti-microbial peptides (including defensins, cathelicidins and histatins) that contribute to the host defence. Cell activation leads to the production of chemokines, cytokines and other agents signalling cell injury [12] . Chemokines have the role of attracting immune cells (neutrophils, macrophages, NK cells and lymphocytes) to the infection site. There, phagocytic cells (neutrophils, macrophages) can ingest and kill the micro-organisms into phagolysosomes. Other cytokines produced at the infection site, together with TLR triggering by microbial or endogenous agents, can activate immune cells to better effect their inflammatory defence action and to initiate the triggering of specific acquired immunity [13] [14] [15] . Factors with a potent anti-microbial role produced during the inflammatory reaction include cytokines and chemokines, acute phase proteins and long pentraxins, complement components [16, 17] . Dendritic cells and NK cells are also involved in pathogen recognition, antigen uptake and presentation, and cytocidal activities, contributing both to the innate defence response and to the initiation of the subsequent acquired type of specific immunity and establishment of immunological memory [18] [19] [20] .",

To pass the epithelial barrier, micro-organisms can either damage (induction of cell necrosis or apoptosis or degradation of the extracellular matrix) or invade the mucosal cells. After entering the cell, micro-organisms can survive in membrane-linked vacuoles and spread to the underlying and surrounding tissue. To survive the innate immunity surveillance, some micro-organisms have devised systems to inhibit phagocyte-mediated killing through different mechanisms of avoidance, e.g. by interfering with uptake or by inhibition of phagolysosome formation. Other infective agents, e.g. some viruses, are able to produce anti-cytokine proteins (such as mimics of soluble cytokine receptors) that can capture and neutralise cytokines, thus avoiding activation of the immune response.",

In the first place, establishment of protective immunity at the mucosal sites would greatly increase vaccine effectiveness, in light of the fact that the vast majority of infections occur or begin at the mucosal surface. Moreover, mucosal immunisation could overcome the problems of vaccine efficacy in immunosuppressed people (e.g. HIV-infected), in people previously vaccinated with parenteral vaccines and in young children with circulating maternal antibodies [22] . Other more practical reasons are the easy administration, and the highly reduced risk of transmitting infections (as with syringes in the case of injectable vaccines).",

The phenomenon of oral tolerance (or ignorance) is a very important physiological mechanism to avoid development of DTH and other allergic reactions to ingested food proteins and other antigens. Oral tolerance and induction of mucosal immunity usually involve different types of antigens, oral tolerance being difficult or impossible to induce with strong immunogens, while the reverse is true for the mucosal immune response. However, the two phenomena are not mutually exclusive and sometimes the same mucosal immunisation procedure may concomitantly give rise both to a local significant IgA antibody formation and to tolerance or suppressed peripheral immune response.

Both toxins are pentamers of cell-binding B subunits, associated with a single toxic A subunit. CT and LT can potently enhance im-munogenicity at the mucosal level, by increasing antigen uptake and presentation, and inducing B cell maturation and immunostimulatory cytokine production [21] . Moreover, CT and LT fail to induce tolerance and can even abrogate tolerance induction. However, their toxicity has prevented the possibility of human use [29] . Development of non-toxic CT and LT derivatives was at first based on isolated B subunits (CTB and LTB), which however worked only when physically coupled to the antigen and delivered intranasally. Non-toxic recombinant mutated forms of CT and LT retain partial adjuvant capacity as compared to the native toxins. Mutants and modifications of the A subunit of CT (CTA) are also being tested with some promising results, although in general adjuvanticity decreases with toxicity [30] .",

These agents are essentially microbial products able to induce strong inflammation (e.g. bacterial LPS). However, of particular interest as potential adjuvants are synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides containing non-methylated cytosine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG) motifs, which are particularly abundant in bacterial DNA. CpG motifs bind to TLR9 and trigger strong, predominantly Th1 immune response and cytokine production [32] . CpG oligodeoxynucleotides, besides good systemic adjuvants, are quite effective also as mucosal adjuvants in several experimental systems. Intranasal, oral, or vaginal administration of CpG oligodeoxynucleotides together with the antigen can induce mucosal IgA production, systemic Th1 response, cytokine production, cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) induction, and effective protection from subsequent infectious challenge [21] .",
