The construction of these hospitals can be considered as the concrete expression of a therapeutic innovation which recognized insanity as an illness that could be treated in such specialised institutions. The spatial diffusion of these innovative institutions through 19th and 20th century France is analysed and we explore how far this can be understood through theories of diffusion of innovations including geographical models of hierarchical and expansion diffusion (or whether other conceptual models are more appropriate).",

It involved the construction of an original historical database of both psychiatric hospitals and information on the cities where these institutions were located.

A multiple correspondence analysis was then performed to examine the connections between different aspects of the diffusion process.",

An alternative political ecology approach seems more appropriate to conceptualise the various processes involved; national policies, social representations, medicalisation of care of mental illness, and urban and economic growth all seem to be associated with the emergence of a variable and complex pattern. This paper also opens a large field of research. Compared with other western countries, the geography of French psychiatric care is relatively under-researched, although there has been a strong spatial dimension to mental health policy in the country. This analysis provides a context for studies of more contemporary processes of French deinstitutionalisation, which is strongly structured by the past heritage of these large asylum facilities.",

Since Hagerstrand's pathbreaking work in the 1950s, geographers have emphasized the role of spatial structures in processes of innovation diffusion. From various case studies, Hagerstand highlighted temporal and spatial regularities in diffusion processes (H\u00e4gerstrand, 1953) . Spatial diffusion of an innovation expresses both the conservation and transformation of geographical spatial structures (Saint Julien, 1985) . Innovation spread is driven by dynamic spatial interaction. Two models are classically presented: the hierarchical diffusion model and the contagious diffusion model. The first takes into account the functional hierarchy of settlements. Innovation spreads between densely populated urban areas with a high level of interaction and subsequently filters down to smaller, less influential areas. Size and rank in the urban spatial system are therefore determining criteria of the hierarchical diffusion process. The second model is based on effects of 'distance decay' and contiguity in the spatial diffusion process and involves 'contagious' spread to areas in close proximity. An innovation will tend to spread within neighbourhoods close to its point of adoption (Daud\u00e9, 2001) . Hagerstrand showed that in most cases, diffusion is achieved through a combination of 'hierarchical transmission' and 'neighbourhood contagion'.",

Innovations first appear in large cities before spreading into the whole urban system. However, despite the rather general relevance of these diffusion models, not every diffusion process can be described solely using these concepts. According to Saint Julien (1985) , other factors can interact with diffusion flows, such as: chance events, market characteristics independent of the urban hierarchy, effects of the existence of a centralised or decentralised management of the diffusion process or the competitive or noncompetitive nature of the system.",

            "text": "In health geography, research on spatial diffusion has mainly focused on the diffusion of infectious diseases, especially nonvectored infectious diseases giving rise to epidemics through human contact (Meade & Earickson, 2000) . There is a long history of research to describe and predict how epidemics spread geographically, providing information for action to anticipate, treat and perhaps prevent epidemics. Since pioneering work in the 18th and 19th centuries (Currie, 1792; Currie, 1811; Snow, 1854; Webster, 1799) , the emergence of new infectious diseases at the end of the 20th century has given a new impetus to research in this field. HIV/ AIDS, for example, was largely studied in the late 1990s (Amat-Roze & Remy, 1990; Bastos & Barcellos, 1995; Dias & Nobre, 2001; Gould, 1993; Kearns, 1996; Shannon, 1994; Wallace & Wallace, 1995; Wood et al., 2000) . Recent research has also focused on ancient epidemics, like the plague (especially the second pandemic) or influenza (Spanish influenza for instance) (Anatra, 1987; Hunter & Young, 1971; Lemey, Suchard, & Rambaut, 2009; Merler & Ajelli, 2010; Sabatini, 1987; Smallman-Raynor, Johnson, & Cliff, 2002; Tuckel, Sassler, Maisel, & Leykam, 2006) . More recently, numerous studies have focused on the international diffusion of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and H5N1 Avian Influenza (Souris, Gonzalez, Shanmugasundaram, Corvest, & Kittayapong, 2010) , which are examples of diseases presenting new challenges to public health in this era of more pronounced globalisation (Affonso, Andrews, & Jeffs, 2004; Bowen & Laroe, 2006; Meng, Wang, Liu, Wu, & Zhong, 2005; Shannon & Willoughby, 2004; Smallman-Raynor & Cliff, 2008; Wang, Christakos, Han, & Meng, 2008) .",

However, research of this type can be helpful in formulating and evaluating policies aiming to improve the provision of care, suggesting what factors may help or hinder the dissemination of good practice and how effectively new initiatives are introduced throughout a health system. For example, complex systems such as health services rely on large and expensive infrastructures and on the provision of trained staff that are difficult to move once they are in place, and considerable effort is often required to achieve universal changes in professional practice. Services therefore develop in a way that is 'path dependent'; the history of development of a service can influence the potential for new development in the future. Investigations of this type include studies of the diffusion of: tomography scanners in the US (Baker, 1979) ; abortion facilities in the North-eastern US (Henry, 1978) ; the administration of antipsychotic olonzapine to urban and rural children in Michigan (Penfold & Kelleher, 2007) ; alternative chiropractic and naturopathic practices in Canada (Williams, 2000) , and the international diffusion of yoga (Hoyez, 2007) . Diffusion of innovations in health policy and health promotion has also been studied from a geographical perspective. Shannon, Bashshur and Metzner (1971) analysed the spatial diffusion of a prepaid group practice health plan and Nykiforuk, Eyles, and Campbell (2008) studied the diffusion of smoke-free spaces in Canada using Roger's (2003) framework for the diffusion of innovations and classic geographical diffusion models.",

            "text": "Some geographers have also studied the spatial diffusion of hospitals and (most pertinent here) the evolution of national systems of psychiatric hospitals from an historical perspective. These are interesting for the way that they demonstrate the growth of medical power and influence as well as changes in access to care. They also provide the context for studies of more contemporary processes of deinstitutionalisation that have often retained vestiges of the older health care system, still influencing the way care is provided today. Jones (1999) compares implementation and spatial aspects of mental health policy reforms in United Kingdom and Italy since the 1950s, noting that in Italy, the diffusion of reform was spatially uneven. It was more advanced in the industrialised and urbanised north of the country while in the poorer, more rural south, development was retarded and mainly left to the management of voluntary and religious sector organizations (Galzigna & Terzian, 1980) . Jones suggests that in the UK, psychiatric hospitals developing through the larger urban centres eventually led to a more equitable distribution in the national space. For Jones, this was due to the strong intervention of the British government in the implementation of a national system of institutions, but the dynamic process of diffusion is not detailed in her paper. In a particularly comprehensive discussion, Philo (2004) gives an account of the development of mental asylums in England and Wales up to 1860, which suggests that various forces came into play. Debate and rivalry among medical professionals were important in the early phases of development. Philo also points to developments from the late 18th to the middle of the 19th centuries, when initiatives to locate asylums in what were thought to be more humane and therapeutic settings outside major cities became increasingly influential. It seems that trends depend on national context since a rather contrasting American study (Hunter, Shannon, & Sambrook, 1986) , reports the emergence and diffusion of public 'lunatic asylums' in the United States during the 19th century, demonstrating how over time the establishment of these facilities spread from the north-east to the west of the country. Further research conducted by Bretagnolle, Giraud, and Mathian (2008) on American urbanisation allows us to draw a parallel with the diffusion of the railway network, suggesting that in America, the diffusion of institutions for mental health care (as well as other services) followed geographical processes of colonization and social and economic development taking place at the time. The role of railways and transport networks on the spread of disease and health care has been examined by Hogbin in South Africa during the first part of the 20th century (Hogbin, 1985) .",

It shows the interdependencies between socio-economic development and health care developments across national spaces. This diffusion of institutional structures is interesting in that it also represents the concrete implementation of ideas about appropriate models of psychiatric care. The emergence and dissemination of an idea concerning psychiatric care is not necessarily perfectly matched by the implementation of the idea through construction of the specialised psychiatric hospitals that are of interest here. In this study we are particularly concerned with the diffusion of this concrete expression of a new care model through the modification of the psychiatric infrastructure, since it is at the point of construction of these new facilities that changes in provision of psychiatric care will have started to have an impact on the care environment for people with mental illness. The innovation diffusion model also raises some interesting issues concerning whether or not there is a specific 'tipping point' in time and space at which an innovation begins to spread, or whether change is influenced by more continuous processes of path-dependency whereby past actions and thought influence present patterns of change.",

Prior to these developments, no specific medical or health care response was proposed for people with mental disorders. They were placed in institutions for the indigent and criminals. Hitherto 'insanity' had not been understood as a treatable illness, so the aim was to restrain people identified as 'mad' and prevent them from disturbing public order, not to try to cure them. Foucault (1961, chapter II) suggests that in France, and particularly in Paris, this approach was clearly illustrated in institutions called H\u00f4pitaux G\u00e9n\u00e9raux created in 1656 (Imbert, 1982) to implement this policy described by Foucault (1988 edition, p. 38e64) as 'the great confinement'. The lamentable conditions of their confinement were already being identified in the 18th century (Colombier & Doublet, 1785) .",

This therapeutic innovation was rooted in the emergence of the philanthropic and humanist ideals of the 18th century. These were associated with a shift away from demonological interpretations of madness and the growing pre-eminence of naturalistic explanations. The idea of the curability of mental illness and the legitimacy of the physician's role in the social management and treatment of madness also contributed to the emergence of this innovation Gauchet & Swain, 1980) . These ideas were promulgated through the 'alienist' school of thought, calling for the separation of 'mad' people into specialised, therapeutic settings as recommended by Pinel (1801) in France, and Tuke (1813) and Browne (1837) in the United Kingdom. They were developing the concept of mental 'alienation' (mental illness viewed as a person's inability to integrate in society), arguing that a mental disorder inhibited the sufferer's feelings to such an extent that eventually, both the self and the external world seemed unreal.",

The lunatic asylum thus became the preferred therapeutic instrument of this moral treatment, secluding mentally ill people from the stresses of mainstream society and family life and incarcerating them in a secluded place, ideally situated in tranquil countryside where a strict moral framework was imposed. Foucault (1988 edition, 259) argues that '.the asylum becomes, in Pinel's hands, an instrument of moral uniformity and social denunciation.'. 'Place' has considerable significance in this model; physicians aimed to put the mentally sick in a new situation, removed from places, objects, people and circumstances that shaped their usual relationships and behaviour. At this period, well before the introduction of psychotropic drugs, 'moral treatment', acting on intellect and feelings, also marked a move away from physical treatment by traditional methods of blood-letting and purges applied to the patient's body (Goldstein, 1997) .",

In a report on institutions for the 'insane' presented to the French Interior Minister in 1819, the alienist physican Esquirol wrote: 'These unfortunate people are treated worse than criminals and reduced to a worse condition than animals'. It was at around this period that Esquirol introduced the term 'asylum' to distinguish psychiatric care institutions from both the 'H\u00f4pital G\u00e9n\u00e9ral' carceral regime and 'H\u00f4tel-Dieu' hospitals for paupers, since these earlier types of institution were considered oppressive, arbitrary in their treatment of mentally ill people, and likely to exacerbate their condition (Lant\u00e9ri-Laura, 2001). Esquirol wrote: 'I would like us to give these facilities a specific name which does not bring to mind a painful image; I propose we name them asylums' authors' translation from (Esquirol, 1818, p. 26) . The term 'lunatic asylum' was still used as late as 1937 when it was replaced by 'psychiatric hospital'. By then, psychiatry had become an established practice within the medical profession and psychiatric institutions had entered into the clinical domain. The later phase of our study period thus arguably represents the shift to a different model of care associated with a new phase in the diffusion of changing ideas about psychiatric treatment that were expressed in the new facilities built most recently.",

            "text": "The governmental response to the 'alienist' model, promoting the asylum as an institutional model, was the 1838 Lunacy Act. This required that every French d\u00e9partement (representing the local administrative tier of national government in France) provide a 'facility dedicated to host and care for lunatics'. Promulgated under the July Monarchy, the Lunacy Act continued to influence the provision of care for mental disorders, for over 150 years as it was only revised on June 27th 1990 with the 'Act relative to the rights and protection of people hospitalised because of mental disorders and to their hospitalisation conditions'. The Lunacy Act of 1838 instituted the mandatory provision of mental health care in each administrative d\u00e9partement either by the creation of at least one asylum or by contracting with an authorized voluntary hospital to do so. This legislation could therefore be expected to have had a significant impact on the geographical diffusion of this type of institutional structure, albeit that the 'Lunatic Asylum' was not specified as the model on which these facilities were to be built. Individuals that were to be housed in these new facilities were nevertheless described as 'lunatics' rather than 'insane' or 'agitated' which suggests that the law makers were influenced by the 'alienation' paradigm proposed by Pinel. While the 1838 Lunacy Act did not include direct guidelines on the type of site that should be preferred for asylum facilities, psychiatric ideas on the subject had already been clearly expressed in France. The Esquirol (1838) thus specified that asylums should be built outside cities for economic and therapeutic reasons. The following quote illustrates alienist ideas that dictated 19th Century views of what might constitute (or undermine) a therapeutic setting for care of mental illness: \"Most lunatic asylums are located in cities, a few in the countryside, in the plains or on the heights. In cities, space is lacking, the sick are excited by the hubbub and the noise of the population; visits are more numerous and more frequent; nurses are more distracted, more inclined to leave, while in countryside, there is more space, the sick enjoy more peace and quiet, can go out for a walk in tranquil surroundings or engage in gardening; they have fewer visitors and finally, there are economic advantages. Buildings on a high plateau are more favourably situated but when the plateau is not sufficiently extensive, buildings cannot develop on the same level or be sufficiently spaced out; terraces and steps are then required because of the uneven ground.\" He specifically cites the example of Antiquaille hospital in Lyon: \"Located at mid-altitude on the Fourviere Mountain, it is built on the ruins of an ancient Roman construction. This choice of location was unfortunate. It was impossible to design suitable buildings: yards are too narrow, promenade galleries are missing, the ground is arid, and vegetation cannot improve the view or refresh the air. Water is not very abundant whereas it is required in such a house. Views are certainly very extensive, but the insane can constantly see their fellow citizens coming and going on the banks of the Saone River and in the neighbouring streets. They hear the hubbub of the city; is that not sufficient to provoke feelings of irritation likely to increase and to maintain delirium?\" (translated by the authors from Esquirol, (1838, p. 463)).",

These asylums constituted a new type of clinical and therapeutic environment for care of mental illness as conceived by Pinel. In the following discussion we use the term 'asylum' to refer to state sponsored, specialised psychiatric hospitals in France that were either established following the 1838 Lunacy Act, or preexisting facilities, including voluntary or religious institutions, recognized by the government as meeting the requirements of the Act. Other institutions providing mental health care (in multispecialty general hospitals or independent institutions not recognized by the state) are not included in this category, although their contribution in the general context of care provision is taken into consideration in our analysis. In this study, 'asylum' therefore refers to an administrative category of residential institution. These institutions did not all systematically incorporate every aspect of Pinel or Tuke's asylum model of care, and it is likely that the care provided over the period covered, varied from one institution to the next. However, one aspect of asylum design does become apparent in this analysis; the preference for a rural or semi-rural location as an ideal site. Our analysis indicates that this had a significant and lasting influence on the geographical development of psychiatric care in France and contributed to the specific geographical pattern of diffusion of asylum facilities around the country, as will be discussed below.",

The lunatic asylum can also be considered as an 'institutional innovation' according to the Pederson's (1970) definition, because it does not directly apply to individuals or households (as in 'individualistic' or 'domestic' innovation), but involves the introduction of a collective service. This is underlined by the way the innovation was not left to develop randomly, or under the sole influence of the medical profession.

Centrally managed innovation diffusion may follow different time space paths than individualistic or decentralised processes. In this case, the adopter of the innovation was central government, aiming to influence the process of innovation through local administrative and geographical levels of government throughout the country. The government of the day was keen to demonstrate the effectiveness of this recently created government structure, inspired by the egalitarian and republican goals of the French Revolution (1790). In 1838, legally assigned with new powers in terms of resources, broader responsibilities and greater facilities, French d\u00e9partements provided a conduit for central power to all parts of France, ensuring the management of national space in line with central government policy (Burgui\u00e8re & Revel, 1989) . This was paralleled by increasing spatial accessibility of most parts of the country, particularly in the first part of the 19th century with the expansion of the railway network (suggesting interesting potential parallels with Bretagnolle's study mentioned in the introduction). These processes might have been expected to encourage homogenization and evenness in social and economic development across all French d\u00e9partements, though they might also have tended to encourage early adoption of the new model of psychiatric hospital in the geographical centres of central governmental control in Paris, the capital city, and in provincial centres of government.",

The following analysis explores how these processes influenced the diffusion of asylums in 19th and 20th century France. The state hierarchy was strongly centred in the capital city and its regional seats of government, and had the potential to control the pattern of spreading the innovation through the national space. This could lead one to expect an even, more or less simultaneous geographical diffusion of asylum facilities designed to ensure provision in each d\u00e9partement. In many other cases of innovation diffusion, the largest urban centres are most likely to be the sites for early adoption. However, in this case, the diffusion phase dominated by the 'alienist' model of care could be expected to result in the early establishment of asylums in rural or semi-rural settings close to major towns and more particularly, in the proximity of regional administrative centres.",

Rapid and spatially uneven population growth since the 19th century led to increasing disparities in population size between d\u00e9partements.

Then, at different historical phases of development of asylums, the analysis investigated the parts of the country where they were set up and the types of geographical setting where they were concentrated. In order to model the neighbourhood diffusion process, a contiguity matrix of French d\u00e9partements was created and in each d\u00e9partement, Euclidian distance was calculated between asylum locations and the city where the Departmental administrative centre, (representing the local seat of government power), was located. Finally, to bring all this information together, a multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) was performed on the dataset to examine the connections between different aspects of the diffusion process. At this point we were also able to explore the possible significance of independent and religious institutions that were not recognized by the state as psychiatric 'asylums', but which may have influenced the spread of alienist ideas.",

It allows us to highlight key components of the diffusion process and to analyse their interactions. Of the various techniques for multivariate analysis available, MCA (or 'homogeneity analysis') (Everitt & Dunn, 2001) was selected because it can include categorical variables (Lebart, Morineau & Piron, 1998; Volle, 1997) . Alternative methods also considered were multiple factorial analysis (MFA) (Escofier & Pag\u00e8s, 1998) or mixed data factor analysis (MDFA) (Pag\u00e8s, 2004) . However, MCA was preferred since it is widely used and understood, as well as being the most likely to offer statistically robust results. To carry out this MCA, quantitative variables were converted into nominal categories, choosing a classification which would generate similar numbers of categories as were present in the qualitative variables. If the variables in MCA differ significantly in the number of categories, this will tend to distort their impact on the analysis. This is because variables with a large number of categories will carry disproportionate weight in the resulting dimensions. Table 1 Variables characterising the asylum facilities and the places where they were located, incorporated in the MCA. The units of analysis for the MCA are the lunatic asylum locations created in French d\u00e9partements since the 17th century. Variables used in the MCA are listed in Table 1 . The full range of variables are only included in the MCA for asylum institutions of interest here (state-sponsored psychiatric hospitals that were recognized by, or were established in response to, the 1838 Lunacy Act). However some information relating to private and non-specialised institutions that were not in this category are also projected on the MCA plots as illustrative individual cases, which may influence the pattern of relationships in the rest of the analysis. For example, a psychiatric ward in a general hospital, could have constituted an 'acceptable' way of caring for people with mental health problems in a d\u00e9partement and such provision may have resulted in a delay in the establishment of a dedicated asylum facility in that area, or progressive independent institutions may have played a role in the dissemination of alienist ideas in psychiatry. The MCA includes information on the position of d\u00e9partements within each of 8 statistical regions in France, (using the Territorial Units for Statistics nomenclature defined for the Member States of the European Union (NUTS1)). This gives an indication of the geographical position of the d\u00e9partement where innovation took place at different time points, and the category of settlement in which the asylum was located.",

Four of these eight d\u00e9partements had been accommodating people with mental disorders in specialised wards in general hospitals since the 19th century.

The curve is similar to an 'S-shaped' logistic form, apart from a perturbation caused by the resumption of new adoptions after the 1940s, as registration of new hospitals recommenced in France after a hiatus during World War II. Particularly notable is the absence of any change in the trend associated with the introduction of the 1838 Act. The rate of innovation had started to progress most rapidly well before this date, and the rate of diffusion of the asylum model across d\u00e9partements in France actually slowed down shortly after the 1838 Act was passed. Therefore, it seems that at most the Act only confirmed a pre-existing trend of introducing the process, but there is no evidence that it led to its acceleration. As is typical of diffusion processes, four main phases in the introduction of French asylums can be identified, similar to the stages of 'emergence', 'expansion', 'consolidation' and 'new expansion' proposed by H\u00e4gerstrand (1953) . These are marked on Fig. 1 and the d\u00e9partements involved in each phase are plotted on the maps in Fig. 2 .

In 1800, only 10 out of the 86 existing d\u00e9partements at that time had a public or voluntary lunatic asylum. The voluntary sector, rather than the state, was the predominant early adopter (59% of the new establishments). As shown in Fig. 2 , earlier adopters of the innovation appeared in diverse regions of France. Most of the earliest adopters (before 1800) were d\u00e9partements located in Northern France. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the north of France had higher level of education and industrialisation than the south (Furet & Ozouf, 1977; Pumain, Saint Julien, & Ferras, 1990) . These wealthier northern d\u00e9partements were also privileged areas for exchange and production (Pumain et al., 1990) . It is interesting that Paris, as the governmental and cultural centre of France, was not among the first to establish asylum facilities. Although two hospitals with psychiatric wards and one private asylum existed during the 19th century, no state lunatic asylum was established in Paris during the first part of the period. It was not until 1867 that it opened its first lunatic asylum 'Sainte-Anne'. Asylums for the curable and incurable would be built outside the city at a later date (Lamarche-Vadel & Pr\u00e9li, 1978) . This may have been because of rigidities in the system of institutional provision that already existed in Paris, where the H\u00f4pital G\u00e9n\u00e9ral had become firmly established. It would also be consistent with the preference for locating 'lunatic asylum' facilities in less urban settings. Although Pinel developed the 'lunatic asylum' concept through his observation and critique of conditions in the H\u00f4pital G\u00e9n\u00e9ral setting, his ideas were initially concretised in new institutional facilities elsewhere in the country.",

Apart from the striking absence of the Parisian Capital at the emergent phase of the process, this gives the impression of a hierarchical diffusion process, with the innovation spreading initially in the more populated and economically advanced areas and later reaching the more sparsely populated and economically 'backward' regions (Saint Julien, 1985) . This may have been a simple effect of the pressure of potential demand (which would be greatest in populated areas). However there may have been qualitative differences in the propensity for innovation and the availability of resources for new developments so that areas that were socially and economically more dynamic (Pumain, 2006) led the way in adopting the new style of asylum. This was a period of very rapid industrial and economic growth in the north associated with the exploitation of coal and the industrial revolution, so that the region saw rapid urbanization and population growth and was relatively wealthy at this time with sufficient community resources for new health care development.",

This may have been due to state intervention preceding legislation, and was probably also strongly influenced by the alienist network of reformists. During the years preceding the Act, the question of care for the 'insane' was on the government agenda. The French alienists Pinel and Esquirol, both Parisian doctors, were disseminating their ideas about treatment for the insane. The influence of Pinel's report entitled Medico-Psychological Treatise for Mental Alienation published in 1801 and reprinted in 1809, reached beyond the medical and bureaucratic fields (Goldstein, 1997) . It is very likely that this original paradigm shift in psychiatry provoked by Pinel (and by his colleagues in other countries such as William Battie and William Tuke in England) initiated the lunatic asylum diffusion process rather than national government policy (see Philo, 2004, and Foucauld, 1988) . With his theory on mental alienation and moral treatment, Pinel laid the foundations of French psychiatry through the diffusion of his ideas. On the eve of the 1838 Act, 38 d\u00e9partements out of 86 had already developed asylums to implement the innovations he proposed. Voluntary initiatives remained numerous during this phase. If there was a 'tipping point' at which innovation started to escalate, it occurred prior to 1838. The legislation appears to have simply taken up and officially endorsed a previously established movement by encouraging the diffusion of the innovation throughout the national space.",

The apparent acceleration in 1940 is the result of a bias in the data, noted above; some psychiatric hospitals established by 1940 could not be precisely attributed to the preceding years. Then we see a period of relative stabilisation until the 1960s when most of the 'late adopters' made some provision of this type. During the first part of the 20th century, the drive to expand provision seemed to focus particularly on rural and less populated d\u00e9partements. The North-East and South-West of France constitute areas with high levels of adoption during this period (see Fig. 2 ). Classic models of the diffusion of innovations would predict a slowing down in the third phase of a diffusion process, but Longin (1999) suggests a further explanation of this relative stabilisation at the beginning of the 20th century, linked with the development of secularism. The 1905 Act on separation of Church and State prevented any denominational private enterprise. Furthermore, damage during the First World War strongly affected some asylums. Closures and transformations were considered in some cases. This is a period of rehabilitation and repair rather than of new construction of asylums. The Second World War resulted in less destruction of hospitals but more than 40,000 patients died in French psychiatric hospitals during this period.",

Sectorisation interrupted the classical diffusion process proposed by Hagerstrand, so that the final phase of complete saturation predicted by his model did not occur. Instead, sectorisation introduces a new paradigm in psychiatric care, with a shift from large residential institutions to community-based services. In France, this process of deinstitutionalisation was initially planned on the basis of a territorial strategic framework. The 'psychiatric sector' was defined as a geodemographic area of around 70,000 inhabitants, for which a specialised team and a range of community-based services were dedicated. At this point the incentive to provide psychiatric hospital facilities was no longer driven by the aim of providing institutions for long term care, but by the need to convert and redevelop the service infrastructure to provide acute inpatient services as part of a deinstitutionalised model of care. To be able to implement this new policy, d\u00e9partements who had not yet followed the trend to build asylums had to create such acute facilities. The last d\u00e9partements to build inpatient psychiatric services often set up psychiatric hospitals or psychiatric wards in the multi-specialty hospitals serving the area, resulting in a more rapid period of growth in the number of psychiatric facilities after the 1960s. Arguably, these were part of a new phase of innovation in psychiatric care, rather than the last stages of the diffusion of asylums. However, they can also be seen as a continuation of psychiatric service infrastructure development that had been set in motion though the asylum development process, since in the French case the original asylums have often been retained and converted to the community care model.",

The first of these was the question of how to analyse a hierarchical diffusion hypothesis when the urban hierarchy was changing significantly through the period studied. The dramatic modification of the French national urban hierarchy during the 19th century due to the unprecedented urban growth biases the hierarchical diffusion model. The d\u00e9partements' mean population density increased by a factor of 1.8 during the 19th century with a good deal of local variability, which radically altered their demographic ranking. The urban hierarchy also became more differentiated: in 1801, for the least and the most populated d\u00e9partements, the population density ratio was around one to seven; by 1982, the ratio was one to 34. This unstable urban hierarchy makes the hierarchical hypothesis difficult to apply, even if we hypothesise that the greatest population growth was associated with a greater probability of adopting the lunatic asylum innovation. Similar challenges also face other studies of diffusion over extended time periods. We also note that percentages in the tables and the results of the MCA need to be interpreted with caution due to the relatively small numbers of data points. This makes it especially difficult to assess the later stages of the diffusion of the asylum model. It would be interesting to have more information on the capacity of the institutions and the numbers of patients using them, in order to assess the extent to which provision was related to likely demand in d\u00e9partements of varying population size.",

Some large urban centres, and namely the capital city, Paris, delayed in the construction of asylum facilities despite the fact that it had been the centre of emergence of the clinical and therapeutic ideas about the moral treatment and the need for such asylums. This delay in the creation of a lunatic asylum in Paris was criticized at the time and interpreted as an administrative failure. For example, Semelaigne wrote in 1860: 'In France, several large cities already have model establishments, and rival improvements are developing in foreign countries. In Paris, however, through a regrettable anomaly, the Bicetre and Salpetriere hospitals are not affected by this trend, as indicated by both their imperfections and gaps in their scientific progress and actual achievements. This immobility, in a centre from which fruitful initiatives usually emanate, cannot continue. The capital city is embarrassing itself. A special commission has been established to consider the changes required in this situation'. (translated from a quote from Daum\u00e9zon (1959) ). This phenomenon reflects both the social rejection of people with mental illness and the facilities to treat them, and processes operating in landscapes of power as defined by Dear and Wolch (1987) . While Paris was a centre of psychiatric knowledge, it may have been slow to establish asylums because of the effort required to reorganize the existing provision in 'H\u00f4pital G\u00e9n\u00e9ral' facilities, and there may also have been motives to distance people with mental illness from the capital by devolving provision for 'the insane' to the provincial d\u00e9partements.",

Although the 1838 Act did not proactively initiate the trend to set up asylums, it nevertheless framed the later stages of the process and may have influenced its course of development. Likewise the 'sectorisation' policy introduced in 1960, in the wake of deinstitutionalisation of psychiatric care, also 'interrupted' the final stages of the diffusion process, as discussed above.",

A more relevant conceptual framework might be political ecology, involving the exploration of large-scale social, economic and political influences that shape the local context (e.g. described by Mayer (1996) , Richmond,C., Elliott,S., Matthews,R., & Elliott,B. (2005) ), as well as locally specific factors that influence the trajectory of development of health care systems. Such a perspective would also place more emphasis on mental health system development in its wider social, economic and political context, including the evolution of the social representations and medical knowledge of mental illness, the political management of the diffusion of these innovations, and also the profound changes in the urban hierarchy of the country through the 19th century. A conceptual framework based on political ecology would also make it possible to consider that decisions regarding the development of psychiatric care were being made simultaneously at different geographical scales, from local to national level. Furthermore, it would allow us to emphasize the importance of a historical perspective, stressing the path-dependency that helps us to understand how historical conditions influenced the dynamic processes of innovation considered here.",

            "text": "Ideas of path-dependency also continue to be particularly relevant for French mental health provision because of the continuity between past and present in the geography of the provision of services. Contemporary processes of French deinstitutionalisation are strongly structured by the past heritage of asylum institutions. Unlike the situation in the United Kingdom or the United States, French deinstitutionalisation has not led to the mass closure of psychiatric hospitals. To date in 2010, no psychiatric hospital closure has been registered in France following the deinstitutionalisation principles. The present psychiatric sectorisation policy therefore has to adapt to this pre-existing asylum geography. This creates issues of accessibility and problems of rehabilitation and transformation of parts of disused buildings, often costly to maintain and difficult to convert to other uses, especially when buildings are classified as Historical Monuments. This paper also opens up a large field of research, since the geography of French mental health care has not been previously studied, despite the strong spatial dimensions of mental health care planning, as enshrined in the 1838 Act, in the 1960 policy for geographical division of the country into psychiatric sectors, and, more recently, in the 'Area Health Plans' (projets m\u00e9dicaux de territoire) aiming to facilitate and coordinate primary and hospital care, social and health services.",
