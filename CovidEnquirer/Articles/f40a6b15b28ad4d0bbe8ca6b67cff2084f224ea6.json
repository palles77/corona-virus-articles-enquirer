Th ese concerns became particularly evident early in the AIDS epidemic. In 1989, the American Heart Association issued guidelines to HIV transmission during CPR has been estimated to range from one in 1 million events when HIV prevalence is high (ie, about 30%) to one in 1 billion events when prevalence is low (ie, 0.1% to 1%). 8 However, despite evidence for low risk of HIV transmission during CPR, psychologically perceived risk aff ected the frequency and quality of care delivered to patients with AIDS. A survey of fi rst responders suggested that attitudes toward providing CPR to strangers in an out-ofhospital setting had been adversely aff ected as a result of the AIDS epidemic. 9 Among physicians and nurses in the late 1990s, reluctance to provide mouth-tomouth resuscitation in outpatient or inpatient settings resulted in marked delays in ventilation. 10, 11 Possible discrepancies in quality of CPR delivered to those infected with HIV vs those not infected have been associated with worse outcomes in the former group. 12",

            "text": "Early in the HIV epidemic, prior to availability of eff ective HIV antiretroviral therapy, opportunistic infections (eg, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia) frequently led to ICU admissions with associated high case-fatality. 13 Failure of supportive intensive care to signifi cantly alter outcomes and the absence of HIV-specifi c therapies frequently led to discussions of medical futility. Consequently, ICU use for the care of patients with AIDS during this era decreased, and end-of-life discussions between patients and their medical providers increased prior to hospital admission. 14 By 1988, however, despite lack of eff ective HIV antiviral therapy, ICU use and subsequent survival of patients with AIDS with Pneumocystis pneumonia increased, likely due to more aggressive supportive care, increasing use of a growing spectrum of antibiotic choices, and the use of steroids as adjunctive therapy. 15, 16 Th e Pneumocystis pneumonia example highlights the potential for variability in health-care delivery as a function of societal and provider perceptions. Th e concept of medical futility refers to interventions that are unlikely to produce any signifi cant benefi t for a spe-cifi c patient at a specifi c time. Futility does not apply globally to categories of patients, general medical situations, or to all geographic locations. Lifesaving and lifesustaining measures that might be considered futile at a single point in time might not be viewed as such as knowledge or practice advance. Similarly, resuscitation eff orts in a resource-limited country where escalated levels of post-resuscitation life support are not available might be futile, whereas the same interventions may be eff ective in locations where advanced care is readily available.",

Th is ethical obligation holds even in the face of greater than usual risk to their own safety, health, or life.\" 20",

HCW safety must be optimized through the creation of and strict adherence to standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the execution of clinical tasks, particularly those that have been associated with increased risk of inadvertent exposure to infectious material. 32, 33 Experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome provides an example of increased HCW infection risk associated with respiratory droplet exposure and the value of adequate PPE training and use to reduce risk. 39 In the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome, overcrowding of medical wards, poor ventilation, and inadequate PPE were associated with high transmission rates. 40 Th e performance of aerosol-generating procedures, including endotracheal intubation, noninvasive ventilation, and bag-mask ventilation prior to intubation, were all associated with increased transmission risk. 41 Adequate PPE training and use was associated with decreased transmission risk. 42 Th erefore, measures must be put in place to minimize HCW risk while providing advanced care to patients with EVD. We developed SOPs for endotracheal intubation, central venous catheter placement, use of renal replacement therapy, emergency (Code Blue) response, biohazardous material exposure management, and extraction of an incapacitated HCW (see discussion later in this article and e-Appendix 1 ) in the care of patients with EVD. Table 1 highlights recommended procedural modifi cations to reduce HCW risk of infectious material exposure. We also developed and implemented scenario-based training on these procedures to establish and maintain staff profi ciency while working in full PPE.

When a large central catheter is needed, several factors should be considered to minimize the risk of injury to the operator. Th e presence of an additional practitioner to assist with and to enhance vigilance during the procedure is desirable. Th e use of ultrasound guidance for catheter placement allows for only the dominant hand with the needle to be on the fi eld at any time, minimizing the risk of injury to the nondominant hand during the procedure. We place extra emphasis on visual tracking of all needles on the operating fi eld, on minimizing actions that might aerosolize infectious fl uids, and on the potential use of conscious sedation for procedures to limit patient movement, thus decreasing the risk of injury to the operator ( e-Appendix 1 : invasive procedure SOP).",

Chertow , MD Infectious disease epidemics in the past have given rise to psychologic and emotional responses among health-care workers (HCWs), stemming from fear of infection during patient care. Early experiences in the AIDS epidemic provide an example where fear of contagion resulted in diff erential treatment of patients infected with HIV. However, with a deeper understanding of AIDS pathogenesis and treatment, fear and discrimination diminished. Parallels exist between early experiences with AIDS and the present outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa, particularly regarding discussions of medical futility in seriously ill patients. We provide a historical perspective on HCWs' risk of infection during the provision of CPR, discuss physicians' duty to treat in the face of perceived or actual HCW risk, and, fi nally, present the protocols implemented at the National Institutes of Health to reduce HCW risk while providing lifesaving and life-sustaining care.
