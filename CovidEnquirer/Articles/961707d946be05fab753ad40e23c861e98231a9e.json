This infectious disease results in significant losses in the swine industry and specific anti-PRRSV drugs are needed. In this study, we evaluated a novel class of antisense compounds, peptideconjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (P-PMOs), for their ability to suppress PRRSV replication in cell culture. P-PMOs are analogs of single-stranded DNA and contain a modified backbone that confers highly specific binding to RNA and resistance to nucleases. Of six P-PMOs tested, one ('5UP1'), with sequence complementary to the 5 0 -terminal 21 nucleotides of the PRRSV genome, was found to be highly effective at reducing PRRSV replication in a specific and dosedependent manner in CRL11171 cells in culture. 5UP1 treatment generated up to a 4.5 log reduction in infectious PRRSV yield, while a control P-PMO had no effect on viral titer. Immunofluorescence assay with an anti-PRRSV monoclonal antibody confirmed the titer observations. The sequence-specificity of 5UP1 effect was confirmed in part by a cell-free luciferase reporter assay system, which showed that 5UP1-mediated inhibition of translation decreased if the target-RNA contained mispairings in relation to the 5UP1 P-PMO. Real-time RT-PCR showed that the production of PRRSV negative-sense RNA was reduced if 5UP1 was added to cells at up to 6 h post-virus inoculation. Cell viability assays detected no cytotoxicity of 5UP1 within the concentration-range of this study. These results indicate that P-PMO 5UP1 has potential as an anti-PRRSV agent. #",

            "text": "Eight open reading frames (ORFs) have been identified in the PRRSV genome. ORFs 1a and 1b comprise 80% of the viral genome sequence and encode the viral RNA replicase (Meulenberg et al., 1993) . In PRRSV-infected cells, a set of six or seven nested viral subgenomic RNAs is formed (Conzelmann et al., 1993; Meng et al., 1994 Meng et al., , 1996b Meulenberg et al., 1993) . All of the subgenomic RNAs have an identical 5 0 -leader sequence derived from the 5 0 -end of genomic RNA, as well as an identical 3 0 -terminal sequence preceding poly-(A) tails of variable length. The co-terminally identical mRNA species are generated through a process known as discontinuous subgenomic mRNA synthesis (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1995; van Marle et al., 1999) . From the analysis of PRRSV genomic sequences, two genotypes of PRRSV are recognized, North American and European, which are 55-70% identical at the nucleotide level (Meng et al., 1994) . Each genotype in turn contains a number of viral strains. The 5 0 -end of each subgenomic mRNA of North American strains contains a common leader sequence of 190 bases (Nelsen et al., 1999) , whereas in the prototype strain of the European PRRSV genotype, Lelystad virus, the leader is 221 bases (Meulenberg et al., 1993) . The North American and European genotypes have 3 0 -terminal untranslated region sequences of about 150 and 120 bases, respectively, excluding the poly-(A) tail, which is common to all of their subgenomic mRNAs. PRRSV subgenomic RNAs are polycistronic in structure, but it is believed that only the first open reading frame (ORF) of each is translated into a viral protein (Meng et al., 1996b) . PRRSV can be propagated in MA-104, African green monkey kidney cells, and cells derived thereof, such as CL2621, MARC 145, and CRL11171 (Benfield et al., 1992; Horsfield et al., 2002; Kim et al., 1993; Meng et al., 1994) .",

PMOs have a different backbone than DNA, however, with a morpholine ring replacing the deoxyribose sugar and a phosphorodiamidate linkage replacing the phosphodiester linkage ( Fig. 1) (Schmajuk et al., 1999; Summerton, 1999; Summerton and Weller, 1997) . PMOs are uncharged, water-soluble, and highly resistant to nuclease degradation (Hudziak et al., 1996; Nelson et al., 2005) . PMOs bind to target mRNA by Watson-Crick base pairing and can exert an antisense effect by preventing access to critical segments of RNA sequence, such as a translation initiation site, through steric blockade. This is a distinctly different process from the RNase H-dependent mechanism induced by the often-used antisense structural type phosphorothioate DNA (Summerton, 1999) .",

P-PMO target sites were selected from the common 5 0 -leader and 3 0 -terminal sequences found in PRRSV genomic and subgenomic RNAs, the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) region, the translation initiation region of ORF1a, and 3 0 -end of negativesense anti-genomic RNA (Fig. 1) . Six P-PMOs were synthesized; their exact base-sequences and PRRSV RNA target locations are listed in Table 1 . P-PMO 5UP1 was designed to target the 5 0 -terminal 21 nt of the PRRSV genome, in an attempt to block translation. 3UP1 was designed to target the genomic 3 0 -endregion, in an attempt to interfere with RNA synthesis. Two P-PMOs were designed against the TRS-region, in an effort to interfere with PRRSV subgenomic RNA synthesis and/or translation. TRSsg-P is complementary to sequence immediately upstream of, and including, the TRS. The target of TRSsg-P is present in the leader of genomic and all subgenomic RNAs (Meng et al., 1994; Nelsen et al., 1999) . The target of TRS-P includes the TRS and the first 5 nt of ORF1a. NSP1 is complementary to the sequence in the 3 0 -end of negative-sense PRRSV RNA, and was designed with the intention of interfering with the synthesis of positive-sense PRRSV RNA. ORF1aP is complementary to the sequence at the 5 0 -end of ORF1a, and was designed to inhibit translation of ORF1a, which encodes the proteins of the PRRSV replicase complex, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.",

The incremental increase in P-PMO treatment times in this experiment resulted in a corresponding incremental reduction in viral titer, indicating 5UP1 uptake was time-dependent. The results showed that a 4 h incubation was required to achieve a high reduction in PRRSV replication. Consequently, for the remainder of the experiments reported herein, a post-inoculation Immunofluorescence assay with a monoclonal antibody against PRRSV shows green fluorescence, indicating detection of PRRSV nucleocapsid protein in infected cells.

Effect of 5UP1 post-infection treatment timing on PRRSV RNA synthesis P-PMO 5UP1 was designed to be complementary to the sequence of the 5 0 -terminal region of the PRRSV genome. This region is known to be critical in the pre-initiation of translation (van den Born et al., 2004) . We suspected that this P-PMO exerted its antiviral effect by interfering with the translation of the product of the first two open reading frames, the PRRSV replicase complex. We expected that as a result of lowered levels of replicase proteins, PRRSV RNA synthesis would ultimately be reduced. To investigate this hypothesis, we commenced P-PMO treatment at multiple time points pi, and harvested the cells at 24 h pi for RNA isolation. Strand-specific realtime RT-PCR was performed to measure the levels of PRRSV negative-sense RNA (an indicator of PRRSV RNA synthesis). The PCR results showed that application of 16 mM 5UP1 at 2, 4, and 6 h pi led to a significant reduction of negative-sense PRRSV RNA in comparison with 16 mM CP1 and mock Fig. 4 .

Virus titration and IFA results demonstrated that the 5UP1 P-PMO was effective in a dose-responsive and sequence-specific manner. The reasons for the ineffectiveness of the other five P-PMOs are unclear, but could include the inability of certain P-PMO to access complementary PRRSV target sequence, or, that successful P-PMO/ target-RNA duplexing did not ultimately affect PRRSV replication. The former speculation is supported by secondary structural analysis with RNA folding programs, as extensive stem-loop structures in the PRRSV 5 0 -UTR are predicted (van den Born et al., 2004) . The latter speculation is suggested if successful PMO duplexing to particular PRRSV target-RNA sites simply could not cause significant interference with critical events in the viral life cycle, such as translation or RNA synthesis. Antisense P-PMOs against EAV (a closely related arterivirus) (van den Born et al., 2005) and SARS (a fellow Nidovirus) (Neuman et al., 2005) , which were designed to target their respective TRS-regions, showed substantial antiviral activity. In our study, the two P-PMOs targeting the PRRSV TRS-region were ineffective, indicating that these particular compounds were unable to significantly interfere with the processes of PRRSV RNA synthesis or translation. van den Born et al. also found that several other antisense P-PMOs, each targeting a different location in the 5 0 -UTR of EAV, had high antiviral activity in cell culture (van den Born et al., 2005) . In our study, only the 5 0 -terminus targeted 5UP1 P-PMO showed antiviral activity, and further work was conducted to characterize this particular P-PMO.",

When the 5UP1 RNA target-sequence was modified to contain one-to four-base mismatches in relation to 5UP1 P-PMO, incrementally less inhibitory effect by 5UP1 P-PMO was evident, thus providing a demonstration that this P-PMO could interfere with the process of translation, and that the inhibition exerted by this compound was sequence-specific.

P-PMOs 5UP1 or CP1 were applied to CRL11171 cells at various time points post-virus inoculation (pi) and the cells then harvested at 24 h pi.

This could be due to some cells having little or no uptake of 5UP1, or that an insufficient quantity of 5UP1 made its way to the subcellular locations where PRRSV replication occurs. This speculation may provide a potential explanation as to why higher P-PMO concentrations were required in cultured cells than those needed in a cell-free reporter assay to achieve an equivalent level of inhibition of target-RNA expression.",

The results indicated that 5UP1 P-PMO was effective at reducing PRRSV replication. In the remainder of the experiments, a post-treatment procedure was performed. Although one might expect a higher PRSSV titer reduction when cells are 'preloaded' with P-PMO, in comparison to post-treated cells, we did not find that to be the case. Several experiments showed that there was a stronger PRRSV titer reduction in post-treated cells (of about 4.5 logs), in comparison to pretreated (about 2 logs). We speculate that the peptide portion of the P-PMO compound could assist virus entry into pretreated cells, as was likewise suggested by van den Born et al. in their P-PMO experiments with EAV (van den Born et al., 2005) . More virus particles from the inoculum may adhere to the surface of cells pretreated with P-PMO than to the surface of non-pretreated cells. Therefore, cells pretreated with this P-PMO may engender more virus entry and replication than cells post-treated. van den Born et al. also noticed that high concentrations of certain P-PMO appeared sometimes to be associated with increased virus titers (van den Born et al., 2005) .",

Furthermore, substantially less inhibition by 5UP1 was observed if P-PMOtreatment was begun after 24 h pi than was the case at earlier commencement times. This observation is consistent with the expected mechanism of action of 5UP1, i.e., blocking the translation of RNA into protein. IFA detection of PRRSV N-protein indicated that addition of 5UP1 at up to 24 h pi resulted in some reduction of PRRSV-positive cells at 48 h pi. The reduced N-protein synthesis in IFA observations may be due to 5UP1 interfering with either the synthesis or translation of N subgenomic RNA. The latter speculation seems more likely. N subgenomic RNA possesses the 5 0 -leader sequence common to all PRRSV subgenomic RNAs, which includes the 5UP1 target site and has been implicated in the events of the pre-initiation of translation in arteriviruses (van den Born et al., 2004) .",
