No one of these elements is failure-proof but a redundancy of controls provides the most beneficial strategy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends administrative measures, respiratory protection, and engineering (or environmental) controls for preventing the transmission of tuberculosis, the prototypical airborne infection, in health care settings. 1 In its \"hierarchy of controls\" to deal with workplace hazards, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends engineering measures be prioritized above others. 2 However, the health care environment differs from other industries in that the source and nature of the inhalation hazard (eg, infectious aerosols) is usually not immediately defined. Hence, a major goal of administrative control measures in health care settings is to place potentially infectious patients in appropriate environments where engineering controls and personal respiratory protection can be implemented. Engineering controls support the implementation of permanent changes that are independent of human behavior and most cost effective. 2 Airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIRs), and the anterooms adjacent to AIIRS, clearly fall in the category of engineering controls.",

            "text": "AIIRs are used to house patients with respiratory infections such as tuberculosis, measles, varicella, and other diseases transmitted by the airborne route. AIIRs are maintained at a negative pressure relative to their surroundings so that air flows into the room and not in the opposite direction, theoretically preventing escape of infectious aerosols from the AIIR. Unfortunately, these isolation rooms are not always maintained at a negative pressure. As reported by several studies, AIIRs intermittently develop positive or neutral ventilation pressures. [3] [4] [5] [6] One of the most common reasons cited as responsible for loss of pressure differential in isolation rooms is the opening and closing of doors, which happens routinely. 7, 8 Simply opening and closing of doors may move tracer gases and particles, surrogates for infectious aerosols, out of patient rooms into the adjacent hallways. [8] [9] [10] Even with a negative pressure differential, airflow across open doorways can be counteracted by the turbulence routinely created by the movement of doors and people. Such bidirectional airflows have been shown in laboratory studies to depend on temperature, air density, velocity of dooropening, and the angle to which the door is opened. 11, 12 A demonstration study conducted in a fully operational health care setting evaluated an AIIR's performance while a human subject made routine movements. The presence of an anteroom in this setting reduced the net migration of particles from the isolation room into the corridor. 8 Another study demonstrated that air exchange from an AIIR to the surrounding areas often occurs during routine entry or exit, concluding that an anteroom enhances containment. 9 Further, spaces equipped with anterooms have been shown to more effectively maintain a negative pressure differential than spaces without anterooms. 13 However, critics of anterooms cite a lack of clinical evidence on their effectiveness. There are no published clinical or epidemiologic studies conclusively showing that anterooms diminish or prevent the spread of lab-confirmed airborne infectious human illnesses. Current scientific evidence in favor of anterooms is solely based on models or simulated human traffic where tracer gases and fluorescent microspheres have been used as surrogates of small infectious particles. More studies on AIIR containment efficacy in realistic hospital environments, with and without anterooms, would be the most ideal. Unfortunately, studies requiring realistic clinical data, which might be more convincing, are challenging and expensive. Many of these studies are ethically questionable because they call for exposing human beings to different standards of protection in the presence of human pathogens. But still, \"absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.\" 14 The general perceived notion about these rooms is that they are an extra space that is of not much use. Some opponents of anterooms also cite the added cost ($5,000-$20,000) required for their construction as an additional burden on already stringent budgets. On the other hand, if a facility's risk assessment has determined a need to build AIIRs to protect staff and patients, it would be imprudent, perhaps even disingenuous, to build isolation rooms that are known to fall short of expectations, especially when the cost of building anterooms is modest compared with the cost of a whole facility or the cost of adverse clinical outcomes over the entire lifespan of a building.",

Hospital staff members caring for this man followed infection control precautions carefully, including observing a policy permitting only those who were chickenpox-immune to enter his room. Yet 1 nurse who worked in the same intensive care unit developed chickenpox 10 days after this patient was hospitalized. Importantly, this nurse did not have a personal history of chickenpox, so he made certain to never enter the room housing the patient infected with the chickenpox virus. This nurse did acknowledge that he handed equipment to coworkers several times per day through the open doorway of the isolation room housing the patient with chickenpox. He did not wear personal protective equipment because the patient's room was equipped with negative pressure ventilation, drawing air away from the hallway into the patient's room in a fashion that should have spared this nurse any exposure. However, laboratory analyses strongly suggested nosocomial transmission, and modeling revealed that opening the patient's door may have resulted in retrograde airflow and inadvertent exposure, despite the use of negative pressure ventilation. 12 Even though the room was maintained at a negative pressure differential of 3 Pa, rapid door opening may have caused the pressure gradient to transiently reverse. 12 The patient room in this case did not have an anteroom. The fundamental question is, What if the AIIR had been equipped with an anteroom? Would an anteroom have prevented inadvertent exposures in this setting? And what if the patient had been infected with H5N1 influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, smallpox, or another deadly virus; would the absence of an anteroom have been acceptable?",

In this case, the isolation room is maintained at a quantitatively neutral pressure with respect to the corridor, whereas the en-suite (ie, private bathroom) is negatively pressurized.

The insidious threats of another influenza pandemic, bioterrorism, or the emergence of a novel airborne virus with a high fatality rate should be sufficient to convince health care administrators to ensure their facilities are equipped with robust and redundant isolation and infection prevention capabilities. AIIR anterooms may not be the single most important defense against airborne infections, but available evidence indicates they play an important role. Health care facilities must adopt a precautionary approach and include anterooms in the design and planned construction of isolation rooms. We call on the different professional and regulatory agencies to revise their guidelines and firmly require anterooms for all AIIRs.",
