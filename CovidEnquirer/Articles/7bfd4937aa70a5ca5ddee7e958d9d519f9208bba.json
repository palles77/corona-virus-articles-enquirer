In the ArkDPI strain, Y43H and \u0394344 are the two most common changes observed. This study aims to examine the roles of Y43H and \u0394344 in selection in vivo. Using recombinant ArkDPI S1 proteins, we conducted binding assays on chicken tracheas and embryonic chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). Protein histochemistry showed that the Y43H change allows for enhanced binding to trachea, whereas the ArkDPI S1 spike with H43 alone was able to bind CAM. Using Western blot under denaturing conditions, ArkDPI serotype-specific sera did not bind to S1 proteins with \u0394344, suggesting that \u0394344 alters antigenicity of S1. These findings are important because they propose that specific changes in S1 enhances virus fitness by more effective binding to host tissues (Y43H) and by evading a vaccine-induced antibody response (\u0394344).",

Many serotypes of IBV are known and cross-protection between serotypes is poor (Darbyshire, 1980; Hopkins, 1974; Sjaak de Wit et al., 2011) . For this reason, poultry growers must match their vaccination program with circulating IBV strains in their area. In the United States, the most common serotype isolated in the field is the Arkansas (Ark)-type IBV (Jackwood et al., 2005) . Currently, only ArkDPI (Arkansas Delmarva Poultry Industry) vaccine is commercially available against Ark-type IBV. The ArkDPI vaccine was originally attenuated by passage of the virus in embryonated eggs 100\u00fe times (Gelb and Cloud, 1983) . Experimental and field trials using ArkDPI vaccine have shown that ArkDPI does not provide adequate protection (Jackwood et al., 2009; Roh et al., 2013) . One reason may be because ArkDPI vaccine virus does not replicate well in chicks when applied by hatchery spray cabinet (Roh et al., 2014) . Moreover, it has been shown that the ArkDPI vaccine persists in the flock (Jackwood et al., 2009 ) causing a rolling reaction, wherein transmission of the vaccine virus continuously occurs between birds (McElreath et al., 2013) .",

Although the Y43H change and \u0394344 are both found in birds up to 13 days post-vaccination and \u0394344 can be found in contact exposed birds (one transmission event) up to 13 days postexposure (McKinley et al., 2008) , it is not clear if one or both are found after many transmission events from one bird to the next.",

In this study, recombinant S1 spike proteins that contained Y43H and/or \u0394344 changes were used in protein histochemistry to examine binding to host tissues. Recombinant S1 spike protein with the Y43H change demonstrated differential binding to mature chicken tracheas and to embryonic chorioallantoic membrane tissue. Additionally, S1 spike protein with \u0394344 was unable to bind ArkDPI serotype-specific sera, demonstrating that \u0394344 alters antigenicity. Taken together, these results help to explain the selection of these polymorphisms in re-isolated ArkDPI vaccine viruses. It appears that the Y43H and \u0394344 changes offer selective advantages over the ArkDPI vaccine virus by enhancing binding to host tissue, thereby increasing infectivity (Y43H); and by evading the immune response by altering antigenicity of the spike (\u0394344).",

It is interesting that the S1 spike protein containing both Y43H and \u0394344 had poor binding to trachea. This shows that while Y43H enhances binding to trachea, it cannot enhance binding in the presence of \u0394344 perhaps due to a conformational change associated with the deletion.

We postulate that, since amino acid position 344 sits in a prominent antigenic region, the \u0394344 change could alter antigenicity of the ArkDPI S1 spike protein. To test this hypothesis, immunoblots on the recombinant S1 spike proteins were performed using serotype-specific antisera against virulent ArkDPI (S1 spike contains N344) under native and denaturing conditions. Under native conditions, there appears to be no difference in the extent of binding between the recombinant S1 spike proteins (Fig. 5A ). In contrast, western blot of S1 spike proteins electrophoresed under denaturing conditions revealed that S1 spike proteins with \u0394344 alone or together with Y43H are unable to bind ArkDPI serotypespecific antisera (Fig. 5B) . The primary ArkDPI S1 vaccine spike (Y43/N344) and the spike with Y43H were still able to bind ArkDPI serotype-specific antisera under denaturing conditions. Neutralizing antibodies found in serotype specific antisera against spike generally recognize conformationally-dependent epitopes. However, denaturation of the spike protein associated with the vaccine virus grown in embryonated eggs still bound to serotype specific antisera indicating that at least one linear epitope was recognized. The \u0394344 change in S1 abolished this binding. It has yet to be determined if antibodies that bind to a linear epitope/ s associated with \u0394344 are neutralizing.",

Furthermore, the primary ArkDPI vaccine population is maintained in the vaccine preparation because its spike is well suited to infection of embryonic tissues.
