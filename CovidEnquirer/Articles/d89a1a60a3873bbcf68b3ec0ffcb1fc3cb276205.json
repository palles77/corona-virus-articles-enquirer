Arimura, Japan Plenary Lectures PD-1 belongs to the CD28/CTLA-4 co-receptor family and negatively regulates immune responses upon interaction with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. PD-1 \u2212/\u2212 mice develop various autoimmune diseases depending on their genetic background. On BALB/c background, PD-1 \u2212/\u2212 mice develop autoimmune dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) with high-titer autoantibodies against 30 kDa cardiac antigen. We have recently identified the 30 kDa antigen as cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and showed that the deregulated production of anti-cTnI autoantibody is the main cause of DCM in PD-1 \u2212/\u2212 mice.",

Massive inflammation was observed around the pelvis of the kidney and at the junction between the ureter and the bladder, which were considered to be the cause of the occlusion and the subsequent development of hydronephrosis. BALB/c-Fc\u03b3RIIB \u2212/\u2212 PD-1 +/\u2212 mice developed hydronephrosis with the similar frequency as BALB/c-Fc\u03b3RIIB \u2212/\u2212 PD-1 \u2212/\u2212 mice, whereas BALB/c-Fc\u03b3RIIB \u2212/\u2212 mice did not show any autoimmune symptoms.

            "text": "Mammalian Toll-like receptors play a critical role in detection of invading pathogens as well as triggering of subsequent inflammatory and immune responses. Individual TLRs recognize different microbial components. Adaptor MyD88 is essential for the responses to all TLR ligands except for TLR3 ligand, and is involved in induction of inflammatory cytokines through activation of IRAKs and TRAF6. In addition, the TLR3-and TLR4-mediated signaling possesses a MyD88independent pathway, which is activated by another adapter molecule, TRIF. The TRIF-dependent pathway activates IRF3 through TBK1, which results in induction of type 1 interferon. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) rapidly produce IFN alpha in response to viral infection or in response to TLR7-(imidazoquinolines, sRNA) or TLR9-ligand (CpG DNA). Such IFN alpha induction by pDC involves formation of a complex consisting of MyD88, TRAF6, IRAK-1 and IRF7, in which IRAK-1 acts as IRF7 kinase. Besides TLRs, recent findings have shown the presence of cytosolic detector system of invading pathogens. Two DExD/H box RNA helicases, retinoic acid inducible protein-I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (mda-5) are involved in antiviral responses by recognizing dRNA in the cytoplasm. RIG-I and mda-5 recognize distinct RNA viruses. We identified a novel molecule named IPS-1that bridges between RIG-I/mda-5 and TBK-1. Recently, we have generated IPS-1 knockout mice, and shown the essential role in RIG-I and mda-5 dependent signaling pathways. In this symposium I will discuss recent progress in the TLR-dependent and independent recognition of viral infections.",

            "text": "Compared with autoimmune T cells or B cells, much less attention has been paid onto the role of NK cells in multiple sclerosis (MS) . Although speculative, this could be explained by limited understanding of NK cell biology some time ago, or possibly due to some controversies in the literature. However, as NK cells are a major source of regulatory cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 and because they would functionally be polarized towards NK1 or NK2, their involvement in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases like MS is thought to be most likely. In fact, recent works from our laboratory have showed that NK cells in the peripheral blood of MS are remarkably altered regarding cytokine secretion profile and surface phenotypes (Takahashi et al. JCI 2001; Takahashi et al. Brain 2004) . Our initial key observation was that NK cells in remission of MS would exhibit the properties of NK2 cells, with some similarities to Th2 cells. This change is likely to be protective against MS and can be interpreted as an adaptive change to maintain the state of remission. Further analysis has supported this idea and also convinced us that \"Peripheral NK cell is a window into the disease status of MS.\" For example, we have recently found that a higher expression of CD11c on NK cells predicts an occurrence of relapse within a few months, whereas absence of CD11c and CD95 on NK cells would define the most stable remission (Aranami et al. submitted) . In terms of the mechanism of how NK cells would mirror the disease status, I will present our hypothetical model and discuss on the implications and the future direction of research.",

            "text": "Heat shock proteins (HSP) were initially identified as a family of stress-induced proteins characterized by their chaperone activity. However, they were later identified as self-antigens recognized by host T cell and autoantibodies in many autoimmune diseases. Recently, the role of HSP as endogenous activators of the innate immune system has been unveiled. Here, I shall discuss the relevance of HSP60 for the regulation of inflammation and autoimmune disease. HSP60 both initiates and resolves inflammation. Its pro-inflammatory activity derives from its innate TLR4-dependent activation of macrophages and dendritic cells; microgram/ml concentrations are required. Its anti-inflammatory activity results from 3 signaling functions: (1) Epitopes of HSP60, complexed to MHC-II, are expressed by activated effector T cells; these complexes activate anti-ergotypic regulatory T cells. (2) HSP60 is an innate activator (via TLR4) of antigen-presenting B cells which then secrete IL10 and polarize responding T cells towards Th2. (3) HSP60, nanograms/ml suffice, acts as a co-stimulator of CD4 + CD25 + Tregs and enhances the ability of relatively low concentrations of the Tregs to down-regulate CD4 + CD25 \u2212 or CD8 + target T cells, detected as inhibition of target T-cell proliferation and IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 secretion. The anti-inflammatory effects of HSP60 on T and B cells can account for its success in down-regulation of autoimmune diseases such as human or mouse Type 1 diabetes mellitus and rat adjuvant arthritis. A peptide of HSP60 is currently in phase 3 trials in new-onset human diabetes. Migration studies suggest that some event(s) early in life primes genetically susceptible individuals for MS later in life. Also different viral infections are associated with exacerbations of MS. However, no single virus has been identified as the causative agent of MS. We have developed a model where infection of mice with a virus having molecular mimicry can prime these mice for later disease induced by a different virus. Young female SJL/J mice are infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus (VV) encoding myelin proteolipid protein (PLP). After infection when recombinant VV PLP has been cleared, mice have no clinical signs of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). When VV PLP primed mice are then challenged with murine cytomegalovirus, mice develop exacerbations of EAE. These data indicate that viruses having molecular mimicry could prime genetically susceptible animals for disease early in life that can be induced by a different virus later in life. These data could also explain why no single agent has been isolated as the causative MS agent. Our data indicate that infections need not occur within the CNS for these events to take place.

These disorders indicate the requirement for auto-reactive CD4 T cells to initiate an inflammatory response within the CNS. The immune cells and molecules that actually mediate injury of myelin or its cell of origin the oligodendrocyte (OLG) likely extend beyond these inflammation initiating cells and include constituents of the adaptive and innate immune systems. Selective neural target injury could reflect the properties of the immune effectors and/or the target cells. Selective immune effectors would include OLG/myelin specific MHC class 1 restricted \u03b1\u03b2 CD8 T cells and antibody. Injury mediated by members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily (fas, TRAIL, TNF) provide examples of target-conferred selectivity dependent on expression of the requisite receptor. A chronic inflammatory environment can contribute both to enhanced production of such effector molecules and upregulation of their receptors. Such an environment can also enhance expression of molecular partners (CD56, NKG2D and their ligands) involved in non MHC restricted cytotoxic responses mediated by innate immune cells (NK cells, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells) and even induce such molecules on \u03b1\u03b2 T cells. Neuro-protective strategies can be directed at the immuneneural molecules directly involved in the injury process or at modulating the CNS environment that regulates their expression and/ or activity.",

            "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) has initially been defined as a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, which gives rise to focal demyelinated plaques in the white matter. Although such demyelinated plaques are the diagnostic hallmark of the pathology, the disease is much more complex. Focal white matter plaques are highly heterogeneous regarding the immunopathological profile, the patterns of tissue destruction and their capacity for repair. This heterogeneity is in part stage dependent and in part reflects a true diversity between patients or patient subgroups. In addition, pathological alterations are not restricted to focal white matter plaques, but the CNS is affected in a global sense. This is particularly the case in patients with primary or secondary progressive MS. In such patients extensive demyelination is also found in the cerebral cortex and in the deep brain stem nuclei. Furthermore, there is massive diffuse axonal injury and damage in the normal appearing white matter, which is associated with persistent inflammation by T-cells, B-cells and Plasma Cells as well as by global and diffuse microglia activation. Only part of the spectrum of pathological alterations within the MS brain can so far be detected by magnetic resonance imaging. In addition, the pathogenesis of the diverse components of MS pathology is apparently different. The complex pathology of MS suggests that therapeutic strategies should be tailored to cope with these stage and patient dependent variability. There is an intense cross-talk between muscle and immune cells. Muscle cells can express many immunologically important molecules, including MHC and co-stimulatory molecules. Furthermore, muscle cells can secrete many cytokines, chemokines and cell adhesion molecules, as well as receptors of the innate immune system. Conversely, elements of the immune system affect muscle cell properties. Therefore, muscle cells should be considered as active modulators rather than passive targets of immune reactions. This is relevant to the immunopathogenesis of the different inflammatory myopathies. In polymyositis and inclusion body myositis, clonally expanded CD8-positive T cells invade muscle fibers that express MHC class I antigens. The causative antigen(s) have not yet been defined. Recently, however, it has become possible to \"revive\" putatively pathogenic, autoimmune T cells from frozen specimens of human muscle biopsy tissue. Using CDR3 spectratyping, clonally expanded T cell receptor (TCR) \u03b2-chains can be identified in muscle sections of patients with inflammatory myopathy. The putatively pathogenic T cells can be isolated by laser-microdissection, and co-expressed pairs of TCR alpha-and beta-chains identified by a multiplex PCR protocol which allows the concomitant amplification of both chains from single cells. The paired TCR alpha-and beta-chains are functionally expressed in T-hybridoma cells, which can be used to search for the target antigen(s).",

When NKT cells are in vivo activated with a single injection of \u03b1-galactosylceramide (\u03b1-GalCer), splenic DCs undergo a rapid maturation and acquire a potential to produce high IL-12, which induces Th1-type response. By contrast, repeated \u03b1-GalCer-stimulation activates NKT cells to keep producing IL-10 but stop producing IFN-\u03b3, resulting in generation of regulatory DCs, which produce high IL-10 and low IL-12. In fact, IL-10 from NKT cells in the absence of IFN-\u03b3 keeps maintaining regulatory activity of DCs to produce IL-10 for a long time (at least 30 days), and also generates IL-10-producing regulatory T cells. The high IL-10 and low IL-12 production in the regulatory DCs are due to the upregulation of phosphorylation of p44/42 extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk-1/2) and the augmented production of I\u03baB induced suppression of NF\u03baB activation, respectively. When experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) is induced, EAE development is significantly suppressed by generating regulatory CD4 + T cells which are induced by the transfer of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-pulsed DCs obtained by repeated \u03b1-GalCer-stimulation. These findings indicate that NKT cells play important roles in inducing regulatory T cells suppressing EAE development.",

Association to susceptibility for MS is the primary outcome of the study. The addition of subjects and markers to our published dataset has improved the maximal association to a LOD score of 6.9 and has refined our locus from an 8 Mb to a 6 Mb segment. Efforts are ongoing to further refine this locus; an additional 200 affected subjects and 500 markers are currently being genotyped.

But subsequent whole genome linkage screens have failed conclusively to identify any other susceptibility factors. Results from the most recent high-density linkage screen indicate that non-HLA loci exert only modest effects individually, and will require testing for association in large datasets if they are to be identified with any statistical confidence. Results from the human genome variation project have confirmed that linkage disequilibrium (LD), the correlation between closely mapped loci, is a highly variable but common feature of the human genome. One often considered consequence of LD is the possibility effectively to screen very nearly all the common variations in the human genome by typing just a proportion of these polymorphisms, especially if the typed markers are carefully chosen to capture as much of the available variation as possible (e.g. tagging). The technology required to undertake such \"indirect\" whole genome association screening is now a reality. In our indirect association screen for multiple sclerosis the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium (IMSGC) is genotyping the Affymetrix 500k chip in 1000 trio families (an affected International Symposium: Alzheimers disease, neurodegeneration and immunity Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss and severe cognitive decline. These clinical features are manifested morphologically by excessive accumulation of extracellular amyloid \u03b2-peptide (A-beta) in the brain parenchyma, particularly in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, leading to neuronal loss. In addition, aggregates of A-beta that forms neuritic plaques in the brain become toxic in that they trigger chronic glial activation and thereby interfere with normal brain function. Investigating how the immune system is involved in the disease is based on new emerging characteristics of three biological systems: autoimmunity, brain-immune interactions, and neurogenesis. Our data demonstrate that A-beta specific T cells are induced in AD and that the specificity and magnitude of these responses depend primarily on HLA-DR alleles. Limited expression of IFN-\u03b3 in the brain, as observed during normal brain aging, is essential to promote migration of these A-beta reactive T cells to the parenchymal tissue in the hippocampus and subsequently interaction with local antigen presenting cells. In contrast to the injurious effects induced by chronic innate immune mechanisms involved in AD, T-cell-mediated immunomodulation may support tissue recovery by regulating glial activation and differentiation, clearance of A-beta, and neuronal survival. The translation of these results to safe immunotherapeutic approaches will be discussed.",

Tabira a a National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, Obu, Japan; b DNAVEC corporation, Tsukuba, Japan; c Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; d Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan Background: Alzheimer's disease is characterized by progressive loss of cognitive function due to amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) deposits in the central nervous system. Based on the amyloid cascade theory, many reports indicated that immunotherapy is effective for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. We developed the mucosal immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease by nasal administration of recombinant sendaivirus vector expressing A\u03b2 1-43/IL-10. Method: 24-25-months old APP transgenic mouse were nasally administered once with recombinant sendaivirus vector expressing A\u03b2 1-43/IL-10. After 8 weeks of treatment, mice were sacrificed and investigated the amyloid burdens in the brains by immunohistochemistry and ELISA. Results: Serum antibody levels for A\u03b2 were elevated after four weeks of treatment. Immunohistochemistry of the mouse brain tissue showed that the extra-cellular amyloid deposits were clearly decreased compared to the nontreated mouse. The amount of A\u03b2 measured by ELISA was also decreased in both soluble and insoluble fractions of the brain tissues. The inflammation and lymphocytes infiltration were not recognized in each organ including brain. Conclusion: Nasal administration of recombinant sendaivirus vector expressing A\u03b2 1-43/IL-10 is advantageous in that no cellular immune response was elicited and only antibody production was induced, furthermore, no adjuvant is required. This new mucosal immunotherapy does not induce the strong immune reactions and can reduce the side effects of encephalitis as found in A\u03b2 peptides vaccination.",

Results: We found a significant reduction in amyloid fibril (\u223c 80%) in GA + Protollin treated mice versus controls (P < 0.001). There was reduction of both (50%) soluble A\u03b2 and (49%) insoluble form of A\u03b2 (p < 0.02) as measured by ELISA and elevation of total serum A\u03b2 levels. The treated animals exhibited no toxicity as measured by body weight, eating habits, tail tone, or mobility. Clearance of A\u03b2 was also observed with nasal Protollin alone and direct intrahippocampal injection of Protollin activated microglia and reduced A\u03b2 plaques. We also found reduction in astrocytosis following nasal vaccination with GA + Protollin or Protollin alone. We previously reported that nasal vaccination with GA + Protollin, decreased A\u03b2 plaques in 14 month old APP Tg mice, vaccinated animals developed activated microglia (CD11b + cells) that co-localized with A\u03b2 fibrils, and the extent of microglial activation correlated with the decrease in A\u03b2 fibrils (JCI: 115:2423 (JCI: 115: , 2005 . In this study, after chronic treatment for 8 months we observed no difference in microglial activation, suggesting that once A\u03b2 is cleared there is downregulation of microglial activation. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate an antibody-independent therapeutic approach for the treatment of AD which targets microglial cells and is also effective, without toxicity, when given chronically to young mice as prevention.",

Transgenic mice overexpressing mutant human superoxide dismutase (mSOD1) provide a useful model to investigate mechanisms of motoneuron injury. In such mice, activated microglia and increased MCP-1 are present prior to onset of weakness; and dendritic cells subsequently appear. To define the potential role of microglia in disease pathogenesis, we used a mouse model unable to develop myeloid cells or lymphoid cells (PU.1 \u2212/\u2212 ). Bone marrow transplants of these mice result in donor-derived microglia in spinal cord parenchyma. Transplantation of mSOD1 bone marrow alone did not induce disease. However, PU.1 \u2212/\u2212 mice with mSOD1 expressed in motor neurons and transplanted with wild type mSOD1 donor cells had greater motoneuron preservation and prolonged disease duration and survival compared with mice receiving mSOD1 donor cells. In vitro studies confirmed that wildtype microglia were less neurotoxic than mSOD1 microglia. Transplant of these mSOD1/PU.1 \u2212/\u2212 mice with bone marrow lacking the receptor for MCP-1 (CCR2 \u2212/\u2212 ) removed the neuroprotective effects of wildtype microglia. When mSOD1 was expressed in RAG2 \u2212/\u2212 mice, which lack functional T-and B-cells, disease progression was actually accelerated. These studies suggest that CNS parenchymal microglia can be neuroprotective or toxic, with the specific effects modulated by communication with peripheral immune cells.",

An inherited form is caused by mutation in superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Toxicity is non-cell autonomous, requiring mutant SOD1 acting within motor neurons, neighboring astrocytes and microglia. Silencing mutant expression selectively within motor neurons slows disease onset but with little effect on progression. Reducing mutant SOD1 synthesis in microglia by selective gene excision has little effect on disease onset, but strikingly extends survival after onset, demonstrating that damaged microglia play an essential role in disease progression. Further, using primary motor neuron and microglial cells, only conditioned medium from mutant SOD1 microglial cells produces neurotoxicity on mutant expressing motor neurons. Exploiting these findings, a gene therapy has been developed for targeting almost any gene using continuous infusion to deliver antisense oligonucleotides to neurons and non-neuronal neighbors throughout the nervous system. Oligonucleotide infusion to promote catalytic degradation of the mRNA encoding mutant SOD1 slows disease progression. Thus, antisense oligonucleotide therapy can be an effective means of treating neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's, for which appropriate target genes have been identified.",

Phenotypes are thereby not defined by a single release product or receptor expression, but comprise timed, coordinated, often even reciprocal induction patterns of mediators for cellular communication and profiles of effector molecules (e.g. cytokines, metabolic or extracellular matrix-modelling enzymes, surface structures for phagocytosis or antigen presentation). Adaptations of the executive behavior come with functional consequences, including opposite effects on inflammation, skewing for types of immune responses and orientation for either defense or repair. Although microglia, the CNS tissue macrophage equivalent, is challenged by virtually any neuropathological scenario, less is known concerning the phenotypic diversity and dynamics, associated molecular characteristics and functional consequences. Conceivably, these cells also choose rather variable response options for an adequate coping with an exogenous or endogenous threat and to decide on a recruitment of adaptive immune support. Yet microglia and macrophages of non-CNS origin may differ in reactive profiles as imposed by the specific biochemical milieu, structural vulnerability and control of defence mechanisms in neural tissues. Most notably, distinct reactive phenotypes may not only occur as alternatives, but develop (interchange) stage-specifically during an activation process. Highly organized, context-determined, situation-adapted switches in anti/inflammatory messenger production, timed recruitment vs. decline of immune infiltrates, phagocytotic clearance and tissue rebuilding attempts could be elements of an open, (usually) selflimiting and (mostly) efficient program for protection and restoration.

We have shown recently that the most toxic agent from activated microglia is glutamate which disturb mitochondrial respiratory chain to cause neuronal dysfunctions. Glutamate and TNF-\u03b1 from activated microglia differentially contribute to neuronal damage in neurodegenerative diseases. However, the clinical trials to block these factors failed in serious adverse effects. Here, we show that TNF-\u03b1 stimulates extensive microglial glutamate release to cause excito-neurotoxicity, by activating glutaminase. In addition, glutamate is released from microglia through the hemichannels of gap junction, but not through glutamate transporters. Either a hemichannel blocker or glutaminase inhibitors effectively suppressed microglial glutamate release and subsequent neuronal cell death. The unique mechanisms of microglial glutamate release will give us a new strategy against neurodegenerative diseases without perturbation of physiological signals of glutamate.",

As such, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)an autoimmune model of MS has greatly influenced the development of immunotherapeutic paradigms aimed at treating MS. Despite some limited success in inhibiting relapsing disease, there has been poor translation of animal studies into the clinic and progressive MS has largely been unresponsive to immunotherapy. However, it has become increasingly recognized that neurodegenerative elements are responsible for disease progression in MS. Axonal loss increases with increasing numbers of neurological attacks and results in the development of permanent residual paresis. As active clinical disease in MS and EAE are associated with mononuclear cell infiltration of the CNS infiltration, demyelination and axonal loss, inhibition of inflammation is one route to neuroprotection and if relapsing disease is inhibited sufficiently early in the disease course, it will slow the rate of atrophy of the CNS and axonal loss. This is readily apparent in EAE and has been more recently shown in MS. However, when immunotherapy is initiated late into chronic-relapsing disease course, whilst relapsing disease can still be eliminated such as using antigen-specific tolerance induction, there appears to be a slow deterioration in mobility, an increase in neurological signs and ongoing axonal damage that is (auto)immuneindependent. Therefore just as appears to be the case in MS once sufficient damage has been accumulated then inhibition of (auto) immunity via neuroimmunological approaches may be insufficient to control progressive disease elements.",

Using this model, we investigated the effects of mucosal tolerance to E-selectin on white matter damage and memory impairment. Wistar rats were subjected to the permanent occlusion of both common carotid arteries. Mucosal tolerance was induced by repetitive intranasal administration of E-selectin. The control group received PBS. Rarefaction of white matter was evaluated by luxol fast blue stain. Activation of vessels was examined with immunohistochemistry for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and E-selectin. Memory impairment was evaluated by object recognition, T-maze spontaneous alternation, and T-maze memory retention tests. Mucosal tolerance to E-selectin had a potent protective effect against white matter rarefaction. In addition, mucosal tolerance to E-selectin had a suppressive effect on activation of brain vessels. Mucosal tolerance to E-selectin also protected against memory impairment. These results indicate that the mucosal tolerance to E-selectin suppresses vessel activation support of local immunological and inflammatory processes and protects against ischemic white matter damage.

In fact, NPCs may also promote central nervous system (CNS) repair by their intrinsic neuroprotective ability, which are mainly exerted by undifferentiated cells releasing, at the site of tissue damage, a milieu of neuroprotective molecules temporally and spatially orchestrated by environmental needs. This milieu contains molecules (such as immunomodulatory substances, neurotrophic growth factors and stem cell regulators) that are constitutively expressed by NPCs for maintaining tissue homeostasis both during development and in adulthood. The intrinsic nature (pleiotropism and redundancy) of these molecules as well as their 'constitutive' expression by different types of stem cells (such as mesenchymal and haematopoietic stem cells) may represent a stem cell signature. This might also reconcile data showing that other sources of somatic stem cells (such as mesenchymal stem cells and haematopoietic stem cells), with very low potential of neural (trans) differentiation, may efficiently promote CNS repair. Thus, cell plasticity can also be viewed as the capacity of somatic stem cells to adapt their fate and function to specific environmental needs, which arise as a result of pathological conditionsthis is the notion of therapeutic plasticity. The ability of transplanted NPCs to protect the brain from several types of injuries using different and/or multifaceted bystander strategies is of significant importance for the future of stem cell-based therapeutic approaches.",

Because both innate and adaptive immunity were known to be implicated in the pathologies of inflammatory and non-inflammatory neurodegenerative diseases (such as multiple sclerosis in the first instance and Alzheimer's disease in the second), the question arose: under what conditions does immune activity operate as part of the repair process and thus need to be boosted, and when does it become part of the pathology and hence require modulation? Our early findings led us to formulate the concept of \"protective autoimmunity\". According to this concept, T cells that recognize CNSrelated autoantigens (\"autoimmune\" T cells) protect neural tissue and induce neural cell renewal from endogenous stem cells by locally providing growth factors and causing microglia to adopt supportive phenotypes. Using an animal model of Alzheimer's disease, we demonstrated that T-cell-based vaccination with a weak agonist of autoantigens can shift the default microglial phenotype towards one that enables microglia to engulf aggregated \u03b2-amyloid and produce growth factors, leading to arrest of disease progression and induction of functional rescue, tissue repair, and even neurogenesis. A similar T cellbased approach was shown by our group to be applicable in acute brain injury, stroke, and other neurodegenerative conditions. Our studies argue in favor of autoimmunity as a physiological system of defense and maintenance against the neurodegenerative diseases or age-related cognitive losses that result, at least in part, from aging of the immune system.",

Cognitive performance, tested in learning and memory tasks, was impaired in immune-deficient mice compared to their wild-type counterparts. Superior performance of wild type mice was correlated with activation of GFAP-positive astrocytes in the hippocampus. Restoration of a T cell pool in immune deficient mice, which resulted in improved cognitive abilities, was also accompanied by significant increase in GFAP positive cells in their hippocampi. Our in vitro results provide evidence that astrocytes, major non-neuronal cells that actively participate in neuronal networking, activated with T cells possess a phenotype supportive of neuronal functioning and establishment of neuronal network. Therefore, T cell-mediated improvement of cognitive functions might encounter, at least in part, on an enhanced neuronal plasticity supported by astrocytes as a result of interaction with T cells. Based on this hypothesis, we boosted a T cell response by immunization with a synthetic Copolymer-1 (glatiramer acetate), which gives rise to T cells with partial recognition of brain-specific antigens. Such immunization significantly improved the performance of wild type mice in cognitive task. These findings suggest that the decline in immune activity known to be associated with several mental and neurodegenerative disorders, such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease, might account, at least in part, for the cognitive dysfunction observed in these patients. Such new understandings could lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets and the development of new therapeutic approaches.",

A total of 3894 proteins were identified. Analysis revealed proteins unique to AP (N = 172), CAP (N = 248) and CP (N = 252), and proteins common to all three types (N = 89). There were 77 proteins associated with active inflammation and 102 unique to chronic lesions.

However, the earliest changes that lead to lesion formation are not known. Our recent microarray analysis of normalappearing white matter (NAWM) revealed upregulation of a number of functionally related genes known to be involved in endogenous neuroprotection as well as in maintenance of cellular homeostasis (Brain Pathology 2003) . Our results introduced a novel concept for the molecular pathogenesis of MS with ischemic preconditioning as an important mechanism for neuroprotection. The question arises, which of these alterations occur in the early stage of MS, and which are the consequences after long disease progression. Biopsy tissues are routinely embedded in paraffin, and therefore, we have established a protocol for successful isolation of total RNA allowing quantitative RT-PCR analysis, and detection of low abundant genes. In an ongoing study, we have characterized NAWM from a needle biopsy of an 18-year old female patient. Immunopathological examination revealed pathology, which is in agreement with Pattern III lesions after the classification by Lucchinetti and Br\u00fcck (2002) . We isolated total RNA from NAWM tissue samples of this patient and performed qRT-PCR. Strikingly, we could detect very high NOS expression levels in NAWM of this biopsy, which was much less evident in NAWM of post-mortem tissues. Based on these data, we believe that these alterations reflect very early changes in MS. We speculate that depending on the regulation of the endogenous neuroprotective mechanisms, lesion formation might either be prevented or sustained.",

We examined the effect of pregnancy on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the SJL mouse and the impact of pregnancy on ongoing disease. Pregnant animals showed a reduced incidence of EAE and a decrease in clinical severity, while mice induced for EAE during the post-partum period showed more severe disease. The most striking results were in mice who became pregnant after the acute disease period, showing complete protection during mid and late pregnancy. Cells from protected mice produced less TNF-\u03b1 and more IL-10 than non-pregnant controls. CD4/CD25 + cells were not increased in mice immunized during pregnancy and the primary source of IL-10 was CD11b + cells. We explored the role of dendritic cells (DC) in mediating pregnancy-induced protection from EAE. In mice immunized during late pregnancy, we found significant increases in costimulatory molecule expression (CD80, CD86, PDL1 and PDL2) on DCs. Similar increases in costimulatory molecules, PDL1 and PDL2, were noted on DCs from mice treated with estriol, the pregnancy estrogen. Transfer of DCs from estrioltreated mice protected recipients from EAE. These results suggest that during pregnancy, an immunoregulatory environment promotes DC upregulation of negative costimulatory molecules and production of IL-10.

Pansini 5 -80131 -Napoli, Italy; email: gmatarese@napoli.com Over the last few years a series of molecules known to play a function in the metabolic function have also been shown to play an important role in the regulation of the immune response. In this context, the adipocytederived hormone leptin has been shown to regulate the immune response both in normal as well as in pathological conditions. More specifically, it has been shown that conditions of reduced leptin production (i.e. genetic leptin deficiency, anorexia nervosa, malnutrition) are associated with increased susceptibility to infections. Conversely, immune-mediated disorders such as autoimmune disorders are associated with increased secretion of leptin and production of pro-inflammatory pathogenic cytokines. Leptin could represent the \"missing link\" between immune response, metabolic function and nutritional status. Indeed more recently, leptin-deficient mice have been shown to be resistant to a series of experimentally-induced autoimmune disorders including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis. Normal wild-type mice show increased secretion of leptin in serum upon EAE induction, and brain inflammatory infiltrates stain positive for leptin. Finally, leptin neutralization with anti-leptin antibodies, improves EAE course and progression and profoundly alters intracellular signalling of myelin-reactive T cells. These data suggest that leptin can be considered as a major link between immune and metabolic regulation and that strategies aimed at interfering with the leptin axis could represent innovative therapeutic tools for autoimmune disorders.",

A further critical point for the dual role of the SNS in inflammation is the underlying change of immune effector mechanisms during the process of disease progression and also the behavior of sympathetic nerve fibers in inflamed tissue (nerve fiber loss). This is accompanied by a relative lack of anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids in relation to inflammation. In quintessence, in very early stages of inflammatory joint disease, the SNS plays a predominant proinflammatory role whereas in late stages of the disease the SNS most probably exerts anti-inflammatory effects. Since patients with rheumatoid arthritis most often present themselves in the chronic phase of the disease, support of anti-inflammatory sympathetic pathways can be a promising therapeutic option in chronic inflammatory diseases.",

Our general hypothesis is that focal cerebral ischemia alters immunocyte function through brain-to-spleen signaling via the sympathetic nervous system. We observed an initial rapid intra-splenic activation of immunocytes, including T-lymphocytes. Some of these T-cells appeared to be released from the \"post-stroke\" spleen within hours, homed to the brain and secreted cytokines that amplified peri-infarct inflammation. Subsequently, there was loss of immune competence, characterized by splenic atrophy and increased splenocyte apoptosis. This was accompanied by reduced T cell proliferation and secretion of inflammatory cytokines. These changes produced a drastic reduction in B cell numbers, a novel increase in CD4 + FoxP3 + regulatory Tcells, and an increase in the percentage of non-apoptotic macrophages/ monocytes. Immunosuppression in response to brain injury may account for the reduction of inflammatory factors in the stroke affected brain, but also potentially could curtail protective immune responses in the periphery. These findings provide new evidence to support the contention that damage to the brain caused by cerebral ischemia produces immunosuppression caused by cell death as well as an increased presence of CD4 + FoxP3 + Treg cells. The net effect for a stroke survivor would be enhanced risk for crippling systemic infections and septicemia.",

The reasons for their susceptibility are multiple, based on the molecular and physiological properties of EOM, the requirements of the ocular motor system, and the nature of the autoimmune pathology. Even minor EOM weakness will sufficiently misalign the visual axes to produce dramatic symptoms and proprioceptive feedback is limited to overcome such a deficit. The EOM neuromuscular junctions are subject to high neuronal stimulation, which would make them more susceptible to fatigue. EOM synapses have structural features that would make them susceptible to neuromuscular blockade; secondary synaptic folds are simplified and certain fibers contract in a tonic fashion such that any compromise of transmission would lead to a reduction contraction force. The combined features of high neuronal stimulation and junctional features that make transmission failure more likely suggests these neuromuscular junctions behave more like central nervous system synapses. EOM junctions have lower levels of intrinsic complement regulatory factors, which would make them more prone to damage by acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies. Among ocular MG patients, serum AChR antibody levels are low, which would support the concept that EOM junctions are more susceptible to antibody injury than other junctions. Specific inhibition of the complement system could be of particular utility in treatment of ocular myasthenia. Improvement in understanding of the EOM susceptibility to MG may continue to provide insights into MG pathogenesis and neuromuscular transmission. Mechanisms of autoimmunisation are hard to study, especially in humans. We have focussed on 'hyperplastic' and neoplastic changes in the MG thymus. Patients with early-onset MG (EOMG; age < 40) or thymomas have pathogenic antibodies against the native muscle acetylcholine receptor (AChR).

Independently of membrane depolarization, the presynaptic Ca 2+ influx is triggered via the phospholipase C activation and phosphatidylinositide (PI) pathway which is not affected by intracellular Ca 2+ stores. This focused our attention onto two mechanisms. The one is the membraneassociated Ca 2+ influx channels, transient receptor potential classical subfamily-3 (TRPC3), which is activated through the pathway including brain-derived neurotrophic factor and receptor tyrosine kinase B.

            "text": "Background: Inflammation can successfully be prevented in multiple sclerosis, but tissue repair is still a major challenge for therapy. Bone marrow or blood-derived hematopoietic myeloid precursors are suitable and accessible sources for cell-based repair therapies. Efficient removal of apoptotic cells and cellular debris without inflammation during degenerative central nervous system (CNS) diseases is essential for repair of the injured tissue and disease recovery. Methods: Bone marrow-derived myeloid precursors were expanded in culture and lentivirally transduced with the microglial innate immune receptor triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2). TREM2-transduced myeloid cells were intravenously applied in mice afflicted by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Results: TREM2-transduced myeloid precursors showed increased phagocytic activity and anti-inflammatory cytokine production after stimulation. Intravenous application of TREM2-transduced myeloid cells at the peak of EAE led to a significant amelioration of clinical symptoms, reduction in axonal damage and prevention of demyelination. The TREM2-transduced myeloid cells migrated into the inflammatory spinal cord lesions within a few hours after i.v. application and locally created an anti-inflammatory cytokine milieu within the spinal cord. The TREM2 expressing myeloid cells resolved inflammation by removing cellular debris and creating a milieu supportive for repair of injured tissue. Conclusion: Data demonstrate that TREM2 is involved in tissue debris clearance and resolution of inflammation in EAE. Furthermore, we identified TREM2 as a novel target for the therapy of inflammatory autoimmune brain diseases.",

Although the etiology of MS is still unknown, many findings point to a central role for the immune system in the pathogenesis of the disease. The occurrence of local antibody synthesis in CSF demonstrated by the presence oligoclonal bands or intrathecal IgG production is still the only diagnostic laboratory marker in MS. Paradoxically, however, B cells were neglected in MS research for decades owing to their dispensable role in EAE and the lack of suitable technology, and it is only recently that their impact in MS pathogenesis has been thoroughly studied. B cells from MS lesions or CSF comprise dominant clonotypes containing replacement mutations in their Bcell receptor genes, compatible with an antigen-driven selection process. The same B-cell clonotypes are found in the CSF during the course of the disease, implying that they are periodically recruited, or that they persist in the CNS compartment. This model is compatible with other CSF parameters. Immunoglobulin (predominantly IgG1) is released in CSF and lesions of MS patients. B-cell cytokines such as BAFF are also detected in MS lesions. Plasma blasts and plasma cellsterminally differentiated B cells that are usually only found in acute infectious diseasescan be identified in the CSF compartment of MS patients. Their number correlates not only with local IgG synthesis, but also with the extent of CNS inflammation. Although these findings strongly support a role for the humoral immune response in MS, the specificity and function of this response remains to be determined.",

Data indicate that immunomodulation by statins occurs in a cholesterol-independent manner. Recently, we have connected isoprenoid intermediates of the mevalonate pathway with signaling pathways in Th1/2 cell differentiation. In vivo depletion of the isoprenoid intermediates geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate (GGPP) and farnesyl-PP by oral atorvastatin inhibited Th1 responses by decreasing geranylgeranylated RhoA and farnesylated Ras at the plasma membrane, which was associated with reduced phosphorylation of ERK and p38, and reduced DNA binding of their co-target, c-fos. Our recent data indicate that oral atorvastatin and rosuvastatin are highly potent in inducing Th2 differentiation by inhibiting ERK signaling. However, while oral simvastatin inhibits T cell proliferation, it is less effective in inducing Th1/2 modulation. These individual differences may be important when choosing a statin for testing in human autoimmune conditions. Based primarily upon the beneficial immune modulation of atorvastatin in EAE, we are conducting a multi-center, randomized, placebocontrolled study to determine whether oral atorvastin (Lipitor\u00ae) (80 mg) will reduce the risk of conversion to clinically definite MS in patients that have experienced a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS).

These CD4 + regulatory T cell lines were generated from patients with MS that received immunization with irradiated autologous myelin basic protein (MBP)-reactive T cells. CD4 + regulatory T cell lines had marked inhibition on autologous MBP-reactive T cells and displayed two distinctive patterns distinguishable by the expression of transcription factor Foxp3 and cytokine profile. The majority of the T cell lines had high Foxp3 expression and secreted both interferon-\u03b3 and IL-10 as compared to the other pattern characteristic of low Foxp3 expression and predominant production of IL-10 but not interferon-\u03b3. CD4 + regulatory T cell lines of both patterns expressed CD25 and reacted with activated autologous T cells but not resting T cells, irrespective of antigen specificity of the target T cells. It was evident that they recognized preferentially a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 61-73 of the IL-2 receptor alpha-chain. T cell vaccination correlated with increased Foxp3 expression and T cell reactivity to peptide 61-73.

We study innate signals for glial response, that are both exogenouslyand endogenously-derived. This presentation will describe the activation of glial cells in the mouse brain, in response to axonal injury, cuprizone demyelination and cytokine-expressing adenovirus. Glial activation in response to these experimental stimuli is initiated independently of immune involvement, and results in chemokine and cytokine secretion. Injury-induced microglial Toll-like receptor-2 signals act as upstream on-switches for glial cytokine and chemokine responses, and microglial proliferative expansion. Whereas injury-or cuprizone demyelination-induced glial cytokines and chemokines appear sufficient for entry of macrophages and T cells to the CNS, leukocyte entry in response to transgenic or adenoviral interferon gamma-induced chemokine production requires additional signals, that can be provided through recognition of the pathogen-derived innate trigger, pertussis toxin. Glial cross-talk is mediated by cytokines, with characteristic intracellular signals. Activated microglia and macrophages show antigen-presenting cell surface phenotypes, and can activate T cells in culture. However, the T cells that enter the CNS, in the absence of deliberate immunization, require signals additional to chemokines and cytokines for functional activation. Our findings identify a complex of signaling events that must combine for immune pathology in the CNS.",

Evidence is accumulating that, even within an immune privileged site such as the central nervous system (CNS), chronic inflammation leads to the organization of lymphoid microenvironments that may contribute to sustain a local immune response against microbial or self antigens. Dendritic cells (DC) recruited to the inflamed CNS are thought to play a key role in this process. In multiple sclerosis and its animal model EAE, the perivascular space of inflamed blood vessels in the white matter is the preferential site where dendritic cell accumulate, take up myelin components and interact with CNS-infiltrating lymphocytes. The inflamed meninges provide an even more supportive environment for the generation of ectopic lymphoid-like tissue. Here, myeloid and plasmacytoid DC can be detected and B-cell follicles with follicular dendritic cells (FDC) develop in a substantial proportion of patients with secondary progressive MS. FDC, which are of mesenchymal origin, have a central role in the selection of memory B cells during germinal center reactions. Remarkably, development of ectopic lymphoid tissue in MS is associated with extensive cortical demyelination and an aggressive clinical course. It is proposed that 'seeding' of the brain by lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells and their organization in lymphoid-like structures exacerbates the inflammatory process as a consequence of an increased availability of pathogenic, presumably autoreactive, lymphocytes and their products. Prevention or eradication of lymphoid microenvironments nested within the CNS should be considered as an important goal for therapeutic intervention.",

However, because each ganglioside is present in the plasma membrane, where it is colocalized with phospholipids and other gangliosides to form lipid rafts, we should pay attention on the effects of such other lipid molecules. We recently performed ELISA by the use of a mixture antigen composed of a ganglioside and a phospholipid. As a result, anti-GM1-positive sera had higher antibody titers against a mixture of GM1 and several phospholipids as phosphatidic acid than against GM1 alone. In contrast, no phospholipid provided significant enhancement on the anti-GQ1b antibody titers. Sphingomyelin provided decrease of the activity for both anti-GM1 and Anti-GQ1b antibodies. We next used a mixture antigen composed of two different gangliosides and found that some GBS sera had antibodies specific for a ganglioside complex (GSC), which is a conformational epitope formed by two gangliosides such as GM1 and GD1a (GM1/GD1a), GD1a/GD1b, GD1b/GT1b and GM1/GT1b.

C. jejuni is grouped into several LOS locus classes based on the organization of the LOS biosynthesis genes. Isolates from GBS patients belonged to classes containing cgtA, B, and cst-II genes, which are essential for the biosynthesis of ganglioside-like LOS. Now we have identified the C. jejuni genes responsible for the development of GBS. Cst-II consists of 291 amino acids. The fifty-first of the amino acid determines its enzymatic activity. Cst-II (Thr51) can make GM1-like and GD1a-like LOSs, whereas Cst-II (Asn51) can make GT1a-like LOS. Neuropathic strains with Cst-II (Thr51) expressed the GM1 and GD1a epitopes, whereas the strains with Cst-II (Thr51) expressed the GQ1b epitope. Patients infected with Cst-II (Thr51) strains had anti-GM1 or anti-GD1a antibodies, and the patients showed limb weakness.

In summary, Cst-II (Thr51) strains can make GM1-like and GD1a-like LOSs, and induce the production of anti-GM1 or anti-GD1a antibodies. Then the patients develop limb weakness. Cst-II (Asn51) strains can make GT1a-like LOS, and induce the production of anti-GQ1b antibodies. Then the patients develop ophthalmoplegia and ataxia.

Gangliosides are sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids highly enriched in the nervous system. Anti-GM1 and -GD1a antibodies characterise the motor axonal form of GBS and anti-GQ1b antibodies characterise Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS) . In murine models, we have shown that anti-ganglioside antibodies target gangliosides in neuronal and glial membranes, including motor nerve terminals. Morphologically, dense antibody and complement deposits are found in the synaptic cleft and on perisynaptic Schwann cells (pSCs), alongside a loss of neurofilament with destruction of the nerve terminal, and pSC death. Manipulating ganglioside levels in GM2/GD2 synthase and GD3 synthase null-mutant can enhance or attenuate disease. The terminal attack complex of complement is critical to development of acute neural injury by allowing calcium ingress, activation of calpain and degradation of the nerve terminal. Both calcium depletion and calpain inhibition can protect the cytoskeleton from degradation. Human immunoglobulin therapy also protects against nerve injury through anti-idiotypic effects. Inhibition of complement activation is also able to attenuate injury. These studies show that nerve terminal gangliosides can act as targets for human disease-associated autoantibodies and that this site provides a useful model system for testing new pathogenesis paradigms and therapeutic strategies.",

Our previous studies showed that CD4 + T cells specific for myelin basic protein (MBP)121-140, a highly immunogenic MBP epitope in B10.PL mice, are largely tolerized by clonal deletion in the thymus. However, the developmentally regulated expression of MBP allows MBP121-140-specific T cells to escape central tolerance in young mice when little MBP is synthesized. We defined the peripheral tolerance mechanisms that prevent these T cells from mediating autoimmunity later in life when they encounter MBP in the periphery. Regulatory T cells are essential to prevent MBP121-140-specific T cell mediated autoimmunity. Regulatory T cells do not prevent the proliferation, expansion or trafficking of MBP-specific T cells transferred into wild-type mice. Instead, Th1 cytokine production by MBP-specific T cells was strongly suppressed. Suppression of Th1 cytokines and protection from autoimmunity was abrogated if endogenous antigen-presenting cells (APCs) were activated during the first week after transfer of MBP-specific T cells into recipients. Interestingly, activating APCs thirty days after transfer of the MBP-specific T cells no longer triggered autoimmunity. Instead, the MBPspecific T cells that persisted in the periphery of wild-type mice responded to this stimulus by further suppressing their Th1 cytokine responses. The tolerant phenotype of MBP-specific T cells persisting in wild-type mice was dependent on both T cell intrinsic and host factors, and did not represent a terminally differentiated state as re-transfer of the regulated MBP-specific T cells into T cell-deficient recipients caused autoimmune disease.",

With this in mind, it is notable the multiple sclerosis (MS) often follows a benign \"relapsing remitting\" course. We are investigating the regulation of the mouse model of MSexperimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The disease in C57BL/6 mice peaks in the second week after immunization with the CNS autoantigenic peptide, . A recovery phase follows, correlating with a specific accumulation of CD4 + CD25 + cells within the CNS. These CNS-derived Tregs preferentially produce IL-10, express FoxP3, are anergic, act as potent suppressors of responder CD25 \u2212 cells in vitro, and their transfer in vivo accelerates recovery from EAE in recipient mice. CD25 \u2212 depletion exacerbates disease, and delays recovery. Moreover, CD25 \u2212 depletion after recovery also renders mice fully susceptible to re-induction of EAE. Data will be presented relating to origins, mode of action and specificity of the CNS Treg cells. Our data highlight the key role of Tregs in the natural recovery from an ongoing inflammatory autoimmune disease and in subsequent resistance, and that their effects appear to be within the target organ. Thus there is real potential for Treg-directed therapies to boost natural regulation of active autoimmune disease.",

We have subsequently found that CD25 high Treg population consists of two functionally distinct suppressive subsets that can be identified by direct ex vivo expression of HLA Class II (HLA DR). In these studies, the Tregs that express HLA DR (DR + Tregs) exhibit a strong and swift suppression while the DR neg Tregs induce a delayed inhibition accompanied by suppression of Th1 but increases in Th2 cytokines. The DR + and DR neg Tregs also exhibit striking differences in their production and utilization of IL-10. While both DR + and DR neg Tregs express high levels of FoxP3 and exhibit a strong cell contact-dependent suppression, DR neg Tregs can also suppress via the production of IL-10, which is not produced by the DR + Tregs. In contrast, the DR + Tregs express the highest levels of IL-10R, and target cell production of IL-10 inhibits DR + Treg regulatory function, resulting in increased co-culture proliferation. Whether IL-10 inhibition of DR + Treg suppression occurs by reducing the suppressive ability of the DR + Treg or by increasing the resistance of responder T cell to suppression is under investigation. Additional studies are also underway to assess the activity and IL-10 sensitivity of the individual DR + and DR neg Treg subsets isolated from patients with MS to elucidate the mechanism for the deficiency in suppression by the total Treg population when isolated from patients with MS.",

Disruption of the BBB and trafficking of auto-reactive T cells and antigen presenting cells into the CNS are seen as important and early events in lesion development in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). However, to date there is still much controversy surrounding the presence and recruitment of dendritic cells (DCs) within the human brain. We elected to demonstrate that human peripheral blood CD14 monocytes cross the BBB and, by doing so, differentiate into a DC-like phenotype. Using our in vitro model of trans-human brain endothelial cells (HBECs) migration, we identified chemokine MCP-1 as the main chemoattractant for monocytes migration across the BBB. We further demonstrate that the presence of HBECs during the inflammatory process leads to differentiation of monocytes into immature (HLA-DR low , CD80 low , CD86 low and CD83 neg ) and mature (HLA-DR high , CD80 high , CD86 high , DC-SIGN high and CD83 high ) DC phenotypes. Such DCs have the capacity to initiate CD4 T cell immune responses. Immunohistochemistry studies performed on brain sections of MS patients also reveal the presence of CD83 high , HLA-DR high , CD123 high and DC-SIGN high expressing cells in acute lesions. Finally, we show that the in vitro differentiation of monocytes into DCs can be inhibited by blocking HBECs production of GM-CSF and TGF beta. Our data support the notion that unique populations of immature and mature DCs arise from migration of peripheral blood CD14 monocytes across the human BBB through the concerted actions of MCP-1, TGF beta and GM-CSF.",

The identification of key components of these EC pathways raises the possibility that targeted pharmacological intervention may provide us with novel antiinflammatory strategies for the treatment of diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Efficient transduction of ICAM-1 mediated signaling responses in CNS EC, and subsequent transendothelial migration of Tlymphocytes, is critically dependent on the activation of the small GTPase Rho. Pharmacological inhibition of Rho proteins can be achieved by preventing their posttranslational prenylation through inhibition of the cholesterol synthesis pathway that provides isoprenoid pyrophosphates. We have explored the effect of statins, potent inhibitors of the enzyme HMGCoA reductase which is the rate limiting step of cholesterol synthesis, upon ICAM-1-mediated signaling pathways and transendothelial lymphocyte migration in vitro and neuroinflammatory disease in vivo. We have shown that statin treatment of CNS EC inhibits lymphocyte migration and attenuates experimental CNS autoimmune disease.

Using high density transcriptomics, we could identify an additional gene specifically induced by IL-23 in memory T cells.

Proline at the secondary MHC class II contact residue is required for effective cross-reactivity as its addition to the native MHV sequence increases its ability to cross-activate PLP 139-151 -specific autoreactive T cells, while substitution of proline in the HI mimic peptide has the opposite effect.

Paradoxically, stress exacerbates autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis, suggesting that stress may also enhance immune responses. Therefore, it is important to elucidate the conditions and mechanisms mediating these bidirectional effects of stress on immune function. It has been shown that acute stress experienced during primary antigen exposure increases memory T cell formation and induces a longlasting increase in immunity (International Immunology, 17:1059; American J Physiology, 289:R738). Acute stress experienced during antigen re-exposure enhances a secondary immune response (J Immunology, 156:2608). Stress-induced changes in leukocyte distribution (PNAS, 102:5808), epinephrine, and corticosterone (PNAS, 96:1059) , are systemic mediators, and gamma-interferon is one local mediator (PNAS, 97:2846) of immunoenhancement. In contrast, chronic stress is immunosuppressive (BBI, 11:286) .

As a consequence, maternal disturbances can affect the maturational trajectory of the fetus and chronically affect functioning postpartum. Like the brain, the immature immune system is designed to 'learn' from the environment, which includes many aspects of maternal care. Methods: Pregnancy conditions of over 150 rhesus monkeys were manipulated, including by psychological disturbance of the gravid female, administration of dexamethasone, or viral infection. The impact on the infant's behavioral, immune and brain development was assessed. Results: Maternal stress, antenatal corticosteroids, and influenza exposure significantly affected neurological development. The offspring evinced immature neuromotor reflexes at birth, greater emotionality during the first year of life, and a smaller hippocampus as juveniles. Smaller hippocampal size was associated with a lower neurogenesis and altered pituitary-adrenal activity. Immune alterations were also evident, including a reduced capacity of neonatal lymphocytes to recognize 'self' from 'other 'antigen', decreased proliferative responses, and lower cytokine production in cultured cells. Several mediation pathways were identified including a predisposition for iron deficiency anemia in the fast-growing infant. In addition, prenatally stressed infants established a different profile of gut microbiota, with lower levels of protective Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria. Conclusion: Adverse events during fetal life can affect health postpartum by impacting the brain and immune systems at vulnerable points and changing regulatory set points. In addition to maternal cortisol, disturbance of micronutrient transmission and establishment of an abnormal profile of gut bacteria were identified as important factors.",

In particular, depression occurs in 30-45% of patients, frequently interrupting treatment. hIFN-\u03b1 treated animals also show depression-like behaviors. However, mechanisms underlying the depression caused by hIFN-\u03b1 remain to be defined. Recently, a decrease in adult hippocampal neurogenesis was revealed as a possible neuropathological mechanism of depression. Neurogenesis is known to be regulated by various cytokines. Therefore, we investigated the effect of subchronic hIFN-\u03b1 treatment (5000-50,000 IU/kg/day) on neurogenesis in the adult rat dentate gyrus (DG). The doses correspond to clinical doses and have been shown to induce depressive behavior in rodents without reducing voluntary activity. Immediately after a one-week treatment with hIFN-\u03b1, BrdU-labeled proliferating cells were decreased in the DG, but we did not detect an effect on cell differentiation into mature granule cells until three weeks after the treatment. After hIFN-\u03b1 treatment, interleukin-1beta (IL-1\u03b2), a major proinflammatory cytokine, increased in the hippocampus. Co-administration of an IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) completely blocked the hIFN-\u03b1-induced suppression of cell proliferation in the DG. Our results demonstrated that hIFN-\u03b1 suppressed cell proliferation but not cell differentiation in the DG, and that IL-1\u03b2 plays an essential role in the suppression. The decreased cell proliferation caused by hIFN-\u03b1-induced IL-1\u03b2 may be partly responsible for hIFN-\u03b1 induced depression.",

Trapp Department of Neurosciences, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA Neurodegeneration is the major cause of permanent neurological disability in individuals with the demyelinating disease, multiple sclerosis. The continuous and irreversible neurological decline that occurs during the latter stages of MS is thought to result from degeneration of chronically demyelinated axons. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the degeneration or dysfunction of chronically demyelinated axons are poorly understood. One proposed mechanism involves dysfunction of the Na + /K + ATPase, which is essential for nerve transmission. In this study, we determined the distribution of Na + /K + ATPase subunits in normal human white matter and demyelinated lesions in multiple sclerosis. Na + /K + ATPase subunits \u03b11, \u03b13 and \u03b21 were detected in the internodal axolemma and absent from the nodal axolemma of myelinated fibers in the adult human brain. Following demyelination, all three subunits were initially detectable on demyelinated axolemma. In contract, over 50% of demyelinated axons in chronic inactive lesions of multiple sclerosis contained little or no Na + /K + ATPase immunoreactivity. As a result, these chronically demyelinated axons cannot exchange axoplasmic Na + for extracellular K + and their axolemma remains in a depolarized state and incapable of nerve transmission. We propose that loss of axonal Na + /K + ATPase is a major contributor to axonal degeneration and continuous neurological decline in multiple sclerosis patients.",

Experimental genetic data suggest there are additional functions of ensheathing glia that may even precede myelination (in evolutionary terms) and are relevant for disease. We have previously shown that null mutations of two glial genes, Plp1 and Cnp1, do not impair the functional myelination of the CNS but cause progressive axonal degeneration in the absence of inflammation (Griffiths et al., Science, 1998; Lappe-Siefke et al., Nat Genet., 2003) . Axon loss is preceded by swellings and slowing of retrograde transport (Edgar et al., JCB, 2004) , but the underlying cause is not understood. Recently, a proteom analysis of myelin membranes, purified from brains of PLP null mutants, revealed the virtual absence of an NAD + dependent regulatory enzyme (Jansen et al., unpublished) . This suggests that some oligodendrocyte functions are coupled to the energy state of the white matter. In support, we find extensive axonal loss and demyelination in Pex5 conditional mouse mutants that lack functional peroxisomes, which are known for their role in fatty acid \u03b2-oxydation. Surprisingly, the oligodendrocyte-specific loss of Pex5 shares many pathological features with human X-linked ALD, including the invasion of B-and T-cells into the brain (Kassmann et al., unpublished) . This novel mouse mutant proves experimentally that glial peroxisomes are important for axonal maintenance and that a primary oligodendrocyte defect is sufficient to cause a secondary inflammatory response, a finding relevant to the etiology of multiple sclerosis.",

Filbin Biology Department, Hunter College, 695 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10024, USA One of the major impediments to axonal regeneration after injury is inhibitors in myelin. Three myelin inhibitors have been identified in NogoA, MAG and OMgp. One approach to overcome these inhibitors to encourage regeneration is to change the intrinsic state of the axon such that it no longer recognizes these molecules as inhibitory. We have shown that if the neuronal cAMP levels are elevated either artificially with an analogue such as db cAMP or by priming neurons with a variety of neurotrophins (NGF, BDNF) before exposure to the inhibitor, MAG and myelin in general no longer inhibit axonal growth. Furthermore, we have also shown that the longrecognized ability of spinal dorsal column axons to regenerate if the peripheral branch of the same neuron is lesioned beforehand is a consequence of a transient increase in endogenous cAMP levels in the DRG cell bodies. Importantly, injection of db cAMP directly into the DRG in the absence of a conditioning lesion, is sufficient to induce regeneration of subsequently lesioned dorsal column axons. This cAMP effect is transcription dependent and we have identified 4 very different genes that are up-regulated in response to either elevation of cAMP or a conditioning lesion. All 4 of these proteins block inhibition by myelin and they are currently being tested for their ability to promote regeneration in vivo.",

However, the inconsistency of remyelination in multiple sclerosis, and the loss of axonal integrity that results from its failure, makes enhancement of remyelination an important therapeutic objective.

            "text": "Genetics of neuroimmunological disorders T. Olsson a and George Ebers b a Neuroimmunology Unit, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden; b University of Oxford, UK There is solid evidence for the role of genes regulating MS. Their deciphering may allow definition of mechanisms central for disease and thereby for more precise and selective therapy. The MHC/HLA complex is well established as a risk gene region. Studies in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) have shown allele specific disease protective and promoting actions from both the class I and class II genes, possibly to be conveyed by critical peptide-MHC molecule interactions. Similar data now accumulate for human MS as well. Linkage analyses have failed to show any non-HLA region and the paradigm generally used to justify genome searches may be incorrect or the effect of any individual locus would be small. Indeed, the few examples of discrete non-MHC genes with suggested or proven influence display odds ratios in the order of 1.5, such as the PKRCA, IL7R and MHCIITA. There is some interest in whole genome SNP typing with association analysis of large case-control materials but there is no assurance that this approach will be fruitful. Gene mappings in EAE may reveal genes and/or mechanisms which are shared between species with options for experimental studies of function. Collectively, there are now around 50 quatitative traits loci (QTLs) described in different rodent crosses. Upon fine dissection each of these often resolves into two to five subQTLs, showing that linkage peaks mostly depend on more than one gene and by extrapolation that the number of genes which potentially has a role in MS approaches hundreds. The experimental QTLs can be fine dissected. Albeit cumbersome, definite disease relevant variants of genes result and the first few positioned genes start to appear in the literature. In Western countries, frequencies of cases of opticospinal (OS) multiple sclerosis (MS), and of MS cases lacking oligoclonal immunoglobulin G bands (OCB) in the cerebrospinal fluid, are very low. From a database of 2199 patients with MS or possible MS, we identified 85 patients with OCB-negative MS and 58 patients with OSMS. (OSMS was defined broadly as clinical evidence of involvement of the optic nerve, brainstem or spinal cord, without clinical or radiological evidence of disease in the cerebrum or cerebellum.) Carriage rates of HLA class II alleles in these \"fringe phenotypes\" were compared with rates in clinically and paraclinically more typical MS. HLA genotyping was performed in subsets of patients as well as in healthy controls. Carriage of DRB1 \u204e 04, but not of DRB1 \u204e 15, was associated with OCB-negative MS (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 3.8). High-resolution genotyping of HLA-DRB1\u204e04 uncovered a highly significant riskconferring association between the DRB1 \u204e 0404 allele and OCB-negative MS (OR, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.9 to 9.7). The frequency of DRB1 \u204e 15 was slightly (yet non-significantly) higher in OSMS than in conventional MS. In Japan and Sardinia, DRB1 \u204e 04 is also more common in MS patients without OCB than in patients with OCB; yet, in Japan, it is DRB1 \u204e 0405 that is elevated in OCB-negative MS. In conclusion, in Sweden, the fringe phenotype OSMS is not uniquely associated with any HLA-DRB1 allele; OCB-negative MS, however, appears to be immunogenetically distinct from OCB-positive MS. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the CNS. Complex diseases such as MS likely result from problems in networks of interactions between several genes and environmental factors. HLA-DRB1 \u204e 15 is the only consistent locus observed in most populations, but numerous genome screens also provide evidence for a MS locus on 17q.",

To study the Idd5 region for disease susceptibility, congenic mice having the entire locus and subcongenic lines having defined portions of the region were generated. Our previous study showed that Idd5.1, which is the most proximal Idd5 and contains the Ctla4 and Icos, enhanced EAE severity and regulated ICOS expression and IL-10 production.

This cytokine alteration may be responsible for disease protection in the EAE-resistant congenic mice. Genetic elements present in the region for the disease resistance have not been characterized. The identity of the gene causing EAE resistance will require the development of additional congenic strains to reduce the size of the subregion and thereby the number of candidate genes, one of which encodes the T cell inhibitory molecule PD-1.

This masculinization is associated with transmission of the SJL/J Y-chromosome and an increased \u2642:\u2640 sex ratio. Related studies using C57BL/6J Ychromosome substitution strains demonstrate that the Y-chromosome again influences EAE in both male and female mice, and that the disease course and MOG 35-55 specific immune response in females resembles that of their male littermates. Importantly, this is the first experimental evidence demonstrating the existence of a Y-chromosome polymorphism capable of modifying autoimmune disease susceptibility in both males and females.

Thymectomy and glucocorticoids are the main treatments but they induce operative risks and side effects, respectively. The aim of this study was to propose new therapies more efficient for MG. We hypothesized that molecules dysregulated in MG thymus and normalized by glucocorticoids may play a key role in thymic pathogenesis. Using gene chip analysis, we identified 88 genes complying with these criteria, the most remarkable being the B cell chemoattractant (CXCL13). Its expression was increased in thymus and sera of glucocorticoid untreated patients and decreased in response to treatment in correlation with clinical improvement. Normal B cells were actively chemoattracted by thymic extracts from glucocorticoid untreated patients, an effect inhibited by anti-CXCL13 antibodies. In the thymus, CXCL13 was preferentially produced by epithelial cells and overproduced by epithelial cells from MG patients. Altogether, our results suggest that a high CXCL13 production by epithelial cells could be responsible for germinal centre formation in MG thymus. Furthermore, they show that this gene is a main target of corticotherapy. Thus, new therapies targeting CXCL13 could be of interest for MG and other autoimmune diseases characterized by ectopic germinal centre formation. The role of CXCR3 ligands, CXCL9 and CXCL10, in herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection was investigated. C57BL/6 wild type (WT), CXCL9 deficient (CXCL9 \u2212/\u2212 ), and CXCL10 deficient (CXCL10 \u2212/\u2212 ) mice were infected with HSV-1 (1000 plaque forming units/cornea) and assessed for virus titer as well as the host response to infection in the trigeminal ganglion (TG) and brain stem (BS) during acute infection (days 3-7 post infection, pi). HSV-1 titers recovered in the TG and BS of CXCL10 \u2212/\u2212 mice were 1-2 logs higher in comparison to CXCL9 \u2212/\u2212 or WT mice day 3-day 7 pi. Likewise, there was a significant loss in thymocytes in the CXCL10 \u2212/\u2212 mice following infection relative to the other two groups which did not correlate with changes in corticosterone levels but rather, the incidence of detectable virus within the thymus. Bone marrow progenitor cell commitment was noticeably modified with a strong change toward myeloid and away from lymphoid progenitors. In evaluating T cell infiltration into the TG and BS of infected mice, CXCL9 \u2212/\u2212 mice possessed more CD4 and CD8 T cells in the TG compared to the WT mice day 7 pi. In contrast, CXCL10 \u2212/\u2212 mice possessed more CD4 and CD8 T cells in the BS compared to the WT mice day 7 pi. The absolute number of NK cells (NK1.1 + CD3 \u2212 ) was reduced in the TG and BS of CXCL10 \u2212/\u2212 mice compared to the WT or CXCL9 \u2212/\u2212 mice.

Although clinical signs are similar among disease subtypes, it becomes evident that the lesion formation in the central nervous system (CNS) may take place by different mechanisms. In the present study, we induced three different types of EAE, i.e. acute, biphasic and chronic EAE, in rats and examined the effects of decoy chemokine (7ND) gene therapy, which inhibit the migration of macrophages. Interestingly, it was demonstrated that the clinical course of acute EAE was not affected, whereas chronic EAE was completely suppressed with the treatment. Furthermore, the relapse, but not the first attack, of biphasic EAE was inhibited by gene administration. Histopathological examinations revealed that the number of infiltrating macrophages was reduced in all the stages of three types of EAE. Real time PCR analysis showed that the levels of cytokine and chemokine mRNA paralleled with the macrophage behavior in the CNS. These findings suggest that in acute EAE and the first attack of biphasic EAE where anti-macrophage therapy was almost ineffective, pathogenic T cells play a critical role. In contrast, the relapse of biphasic EAE and chronic EAE were thought to be produced mainly by macrophages.

To understand the role that CXCR4 might play in hippocampal circuitry development, we studied the effects of SDF-1\u03b1, the only natural ligand for CXCR4 receptors, on network-driven, GABA-mediated giant depolarizing potentials (GDPs) in immature rat hippocampal CA3 neurons using whole-cell patch clamp technique. We demonstrated that SDF-1\u03b1 down-regulates the GDP firing frequency in CA3 neurons without significant change of neuronal passive membrane properties, suggesting that the site of action for SDF-1\u03b1 is on interneurons and/or glial cells, instead of the recorded neuron per se. The SDF-1\u03b1-induced down-regulation of GDP firing was blocked by T140, a CXCR4 receptor antagonist. Application of T140 alone enhanced GDP firing frequency, indicating an involvement of endogenous SDF-1\u03b1 in modulating GDP activity. Taken together, our results showed that exogenous and endogenous SDF-1\u03b1 modulates GDP firing via CXCR4 receptors in developing hippocampus.

For the better part of the last century, the CNS was believed to be both immunologically inert and immunologically separated from the peripheral immune system. It was viewed primarily as a tissue of post-mitotic cells that were highly vulnerable to the onslaught of activated immune cells if and when these immune cells infiltrated the CNS. In this view, the only elements protecting the CNS from immune-mediated harm was the presence of an intact blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the absence of a fully immunologically population of competent tissue macrophages. Current data now indicates that the CNS is immunologically competent and is actively interactive with the peripheral immune system. Inflammation is also now recognized to be a prominent feature of many classic neurodegenerative disorders even in the absence of substantial infiltration of peripheral immune cells. Furthermore, in stark contrast to the older view, neuroinflammation is now realized to have both neuroprotective as well as neurotoxic aspects.

IL-8 release was used as read-out, since this cytokine is highly produced by astrocytes upon activation via TLR. Using this strategy, we identified an alternatively spliced variant of soluble CD14. Using a panel of TLR transfected HEK293 cells, we found that soluble CD14 only induced IL-8 release by TLR2 transfected HEK293 cells, and not TLR3 or TLR4 transfected HEK293 cells.",

Currently, we are further exploring the functional effects of soluble CD14 on human primary astrocytes. The genome-scale screening method will be used to identify proteins based on their functional properties. We previously reported that Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligation tailors the activation profile of human microglia; TLR3, in particular, induces the production of both IL-12 and IFN-beta (\u00e2). The functional consequences to adaptive immune responses downstream of such TLR-mediated polarization remain undefined in human cells. We compared the capacity for adult human microglia, once activated in vitro with ligands for TLR2, TLR3, or TLR4, to regulate CD4 + T cell responses, specifically Th1-priming. We tested the ability for these ligands (poly(inosinic):poly(cytidylic) acid for TLR3, lipopolysaccharide for TLR4, palmitoyl-3-cysteine-serine-lysine-4 for TLR2) to induce the maturation of microglia in terms of MHC and costimulatory molecule expression using flow cytometry. The proliferation and interferon-gamma (IFN\u00e3) secretion of allogeneic CD4 + lymphocytes was determined following culture with microglia pre-activated via TLR2, TLR3 or TLR4 for 24 h. We found that TLR signaling increased microglial MHC class I and II, CD80 and CD86 surface expression downstream of TLR3 and TLR4. While TLR-mediated activation of adult microglia did not result in any significant increase in overall CD4 + T cell proliferation, the ligation of TLR3 by microglia led to a significant boosting of IFN\u00e3 secretion by T cells. TLR-signaling can thus lead to the maturation of human microglia as antigen presenting cells, and TLR3mediated activation can specifically bridge innate and adaptive immune responses by driving Th1 T cell polarization.",

The molecular entity that activates glial cells, however, has not been elucidated. To address this lack of information, primary spinal cord glial cells were stimulated with various molecules that are putatively released upon peripheral nerve injury in the spinal cord dorsal horn. Our in vitro data indicate that spinal cord glial cells are relatively unresponsive to the stimulation of glutamate, substance P, ATP, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), and fractalkine. Interestingly, necrotic neuronal cell extract (NNCE), however, induced significant upregulation of the TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and iNOS genes that are implicated in the development of neuropathic pain. Studies using primary glial cells isolated from TLR2 knockout mice indicate that NNCE activate glial cells via TLR2. In addition, behavioral studies using TLR2 knockout mice demonstrate that the expression of TLR2 is required for the induction of mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia due to spinal nerve axotomy. The nerve injury-induced spinal cord microglia and astrocyte activation is reduced in the TLR2 knockout mice. Similarly, the nerve injury-induced proinflammatory gene expression in the spinal cord is also reduced in the TLR2 knockout mice. These data demonstrate that TLR2 plays a critical role in nerve injury-induced spinal cord glial cell activation and subsequent pain hypersensitivity. In addition, our data imply that endogenous TLR2 agonist, released from the damaged sensory neurons, may activate spinal cord glial cells via TLR2 and thereby induce neuropathic pain.",

Glutamate transporter-1 (EAAT-2) was primarily expressed on astrocytes and keeps extracellular glutamate concentration low in the brain by taking up glutamate, which prevent neurons from excitotoxic cell death. Gray and Gras reported that both microglia and brain macrophages expressed EAAT-2 and have a neuroprotective role in AIDS encephalopathy. In order to clarify precise roles of microglia in AIDS encephalopathy, we examined autopsy brains of twenty patients with HIV-1 infection by immunohistochemistry. We demonstrated decrease of EAAT-2 expression, diffuse activation of microglia, and expression of EAAT-2 by activated microglia in the frontal cortex. Expression of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 were detected only in glial nodules, but not in diffusely activated microglia. These cortical changes were neither correlated with severity of HIV encephalitis nor presence of HIV-1-infected cells. A quantitative analysis of EAAT-2 expression and microglial activation demonstrated that the number of Iba1-positive activated microglia was increased in 12 cases and the area of EAAT-2 expression was declining in 12 cases. There was a significant negative correlation between areas of EAAT-2 expression and numbers of Iba1-positive activated microglia (P < 0.01) among the cases with decreased EAAT-2 expression. These data indicate that activation of microglia occurs according with reduction of EAAT-2 expression on astrocytes in the cerebral cortex of AIDS patients. Expression of EAAT-2 by activated microglia suggests its compensatory effect to prevent neurons from glutamate neurotoxicity.",

The third paper presents findings supporting a paradigm in which galectin-9 expression on low grade gliomas inactivates tumor-infiltrating T cells, which in turn results in promotion of tumor cell proliferation and invasiveness, using a CD4 + T cell clone established from glioblastoma tissue. The last two papers reports new data related to gene therapy. The fourth paper shows new findings on HSV vector-mediated co-delivery of mutant IkBa and HSV thymidine kinase against glioblastoma, while the last presentation indicates that suicide gene therapy using high-titer retrovirus vector is cytotoxic to the cancer stem cells derived from malignant gliomas.

The aim of this study was to identify and characterize glioma infiltrating DCs by immunohistochemistry (IHC), FACS and functional assays. Methods: IHC was performed on 24 gliomas using DC-specific antibodies and the infiltrating mononuclear cell populations derived from six tumors were evaluated by three-color-FACS analysis. In addition, the stimulatory capacity of monocyte-derived DCs from tumor patients were compared with controls in an allogenic MLR and the levels of IL-12 and IFN-\u03b1 production were assessed by ELISA. Results: DCs were found to be present in high grade gliomas at very low numbers and mainly in an immature state. The origin of glioma-derived DCs was mainly myeloid and the T cell stimulatory capacity was strongly reduced in allogenic MLR. Interestingly, the capacity of monocyte-derived DCs of patients was also reduced albeit not being statistically significant to controls. Conclusion: Taken together, these results suggest that the inhibition of DC development/function represents an additional mechanism by which gliomas can escape immune recognition.",

Invasion of glioma cells into brain tissue is a hallmark of glioblastomas and contributes to the failure of current therapeutic treatments. Activated microglia are abundant in brain tumors and may support tumor growth and invasiveness. However, defense functions of microglial cells against glioma are compromised by the tumor, e.g. through impaired surface expression of MHC class II, the immune-suppressed microglia may still display tumorpromoting activity. We found that Cyclosporine A (CsA) can affect growth of glioma cells in vitro by inhibiting signaling pathways, which are essential for tumor proliferation and invasiveness. In this work, we demonstrate that migration of EGFP-transfected glioblastoma cells in organotypic brain slices was significantly inhibited by 1-30 \u03bcM CsA. This inhibitory effect was lost when glioblastoma cells were injected into microglia-depleted brain slices. In in vitro studies we demonstrate that microglia-derived factors increase glioma invasiveness in Matrigel assays which is associated with activation the PI-3K/Akt signaling pathway. CsA abolishes the invasion promoting effect of microglia. On the other hand, glioma-derived soluble factors induce morphological transformation of microglia into ameboid microglia, activate MAPK signaling, although production of pro-inflammatory factors such as nitric oxide or IL-6 was not observed. We found that CsA may interfere with glioma-associated microglia stimulation, turning them into more resting state. Our finding that CsA may impair invasive growth of glioma cells, at clinically relevant concentrations, provides a novel therapeutic strategy.",

We hypothesize that glioma expression of Gal-9 regulates both of these aspects of glioma pathogenesis. Gal-9 expression by peripheral human tumors has a favorable clinical prognosis and appears to limit tumor cell metastasis/invasiveness. Thus, one prediction is that glioma expression of Gal-9 limits tumor cell proliferation and/or invasiveness. Indeed, we have found that siRNA-mediated reduction of Gal-9 in a primary GBM cell line enhances tumor cell proliferation. Moreover, culture of this cell line in TGF-\u03b2, which is expressed at higher levels in high-grade versus low-grade gliomas, reduces tumor cell expression of Gal-9. In addition, quantitative RT-PCR analysis of Gal-9 levels expressed by GBM tumor cells versus reactive astrocytes indicates that GBM tumor cells express lowers levels of Gal-9 in situ. On the other hand, Gal-9 has recently been identified as a ligand of TIM-3, and been shown to kill IFN-\u03b3-secreting Th1 cells. To this end, we have cloned CD4 + T cells that infiltrate GBMs and found that exposure to recombinant Gal-9 inhibits IFN-\u03b3 secretion from activated Th1 cells, which can be blocked with anti-TIM3 monoclonal antibody. Collectively, the data suggest a paradigm in which Gal-9 expression by low-grade gliomas inactivates infiltrating TIM3 + CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, and that with increasing stages of malignancy, down-modulation of Gal-9 on gliomas promotes tumor cell proliferation and invasiveness.",

Chihara a , N. Masahira a , K. Ikenaka b , K. Shimizu a a Department of Neurosugery, Kochi Medical School, Nankoku, Japan; b Division of Neurobiology and Bioinformatics, National Institute for Physiological Science, Okazaki, Japan Despite many efforts to develop effective therapy, the outcome of malignant glioma remains poor. Gene therapy for this disease using retroviral vector is attractive, because the virus can infect only mitotic cells. We established the packaging cell line PAMP51 producing high-titer retrovirus expressing suicide gene HSV-TK and concentrated the virus with titers as high as 1-10 11-12 c.f.u./ml by low speed centrifugation. Using this retroviral vector, mouse glioma model was cured completely by administration of ganciclovir (GCV). Recently, several investigators identified a small population of cancer stem cells in brain tumor tissues and cell lines. These cancer stem cells forms spheres and maintains self-renewal capacity, tumorigenecity and multiple drug resistance. The existence of the cancer stem cells is thought to be a cause for recurrence of the tumors after treatment with chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgical resection. Therefore, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of suicide gene therapy for the cancer stem cells derived from glioma cells. A high transduction rate and gap junction mediated bystander effect allowing killing of non-transduced cells enhance the efficacy of this suicide gene therapy. A lower efficiency of transduction with retrovirus vector and the expression of connexin 43, a component of gap junction were observed in cancer stem cells. This result suggests that non-transduced cancer stem cells can be killed via bystander effect. To gain insight about bystander effect in cancer stem cells, we are currently performing immunohistochemistry studies in mouse glioma model. Studies undertaken in the speaker's laboratory have shown that a distinct population of regulatory cells can be induced by injection of soluble peptides. Such peptide treatment led to the generation of regulatory T (PI-T reg ) cells that were anergic, failed to produce IL-2 but responded to antigen by secreting IL-10. The cells were predominantly CD25 \u2212 and CTLA-4 + and their anergic state was reversed by addition of IL-2 in vitro. PI-T reg cells were able to suppress both proliferation and IL-2 production from na\u00efve T cells in vivo, suppression being abrogated by neutralisation of IL-10. Depletion of CD25 + cells did not affect the suppressive properties of PI-T reg cells. Furthermore, PI-T reg cells could be generated in mice that do not spontaneously generate CD25 + regulatory cells. These results suggest that 'natural' and 'induced' regulatory cells fall into distinct subsets. This distinction has recently been confirmed by demonstrating that PI-T reg cells do not express FoxP3, a member of the forkhead-winged helix family of transcription factors that controls differentiation of 'natural' CD25 + T reg cells.",

Khoury a a Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA; b Transplantation Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA A limitation of many experimental models of autoimmune disease is that they focus on targeting prevention of disease or on therapy of early disease triggered by na\u00efve T cells. Memory T cells are less dependent on positive co-stimulatory signals than na\u00efve cells and also less susceptible to tolerance induction. An important clinical goal is to develop strategies that suppress the function of chronically activated memory T cells. We developed a new model of EAE that is induced by antigen-specific memory CD4 + cells generated from mice immunized with MOG > 100 days prior to transfer. Memory CD4 + cells induced more severe EAE than effector T cells, both clinically and pathologically. T cells from memory cell recipients proliferated more in response to MOG and secreted higher levels of IL-2, IL-17 and IFN-\u03b3 compared to recipients of recently generated effector cells. Percentages of CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + cells were not affected, indicating that differences in clinical disease were not due to differential expansion of regulatory T cells. Effector cell-mediated EAE was suppressed by CTLA4-Ig, but aggravated by anti-ICOS-L treatment. By contrast, memory cellmediated disease was suppressed by ICOS-L blockade, while CTLA4-Ig had no effect. A shift in the cytokine balance towards increased IL-10 and reduced IFN-\u03b3 secretion was observed in effector cell recipients after CTLA4-Ig treatment, while ICOS-L blockade resulted in a similar shift in memory cell recipients. Our data suggest the presence of specific mechanisms of disease mediated by memory CD4 + cells and indicate a differential role of co-stimulatory pathways in regulating effector versus memory T cells.",

In this study we compared the production of cytokines with the presumed role in the pathogenesis of EAE, namely interferon \u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and interleukins (IL) 12, 17 and 23, in AO rats and EAE susceptible Dark Agouti (DA) rats.

The cells were stimulated with concanavalin A (ConA) or specific antigen myelin basic protein (MBP) and the production of cytokines was measured on mRNA and protein level using RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively. DLNC of DA rats expressed higher levels of mRNA and produced more IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17 than AO rats. Since IL-12 and IL-23 are potent inducers of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17 synthesis, respectively, we further analyzed mRNA expression of their subunits: p40 (common for IL-12 and IL-23), p35 (IL-12) and p19 (IL-23). Interestingly, while the expression of p35 and p19, similarly to other cytokines, was higher in DA animals, AO rats expressed more p40 mRNA. Nevertheless, DA rats made more p40 protein as well as IL-12. Taken together, our data suggest that the differential regulation of IL-12/IFN-\u03b3 and IL-23/IL-17 axes, and p40 in particular, in the inductive phase of EAE could be responsible for the discrepancy in susceptibility to EAE between these two strains.",

T H 1 cells have long been suspected to be the major pathogenic cell population in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis. However, we and others could recently, firmly establish that in the animal models for RA and MS, IL-12 is not a disease promoting factor and that T H 1 polarized cells are not a prerequisite for disease development. We therefore wanted to determine the role of another T H 1-polarizing cytokine namely IL-18 and its receptor in the context of EAE. In line with the IL-12 findings, we found that IL-18-deficient mice are fully susceptible to EAE induced by immunization with MOG peptide. Surprisingly however, we discovered that mice deficient in IL-18Ra are EAE-resistant, suggesting the presence of an alternative ligand with encephalitogenic properties. We could establish that loss of IL-18Ra lesions an accessory leukocyte and not lymphocytes directly. We further demonstrate here that IL-18Ra signaling promotes the generation of IL-17producing CD4 + T cells, which are now considered to be the major pathogenic population in EAE as well as other autoimmune diseases. Our results establish that IL-18 and T H 1 development are dispensible for EAE  pathogenesis, while IL-18Ra signaling by an as yet unidentified ligand (IL-18RL) is absolutely essential for the generation of encephalitogenic T H -17 cells.",

Heijmans a , A. Jagessar a , P. Smith a , T. Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) is a powerful encephalitogen for experimental autoimmune demyelination. However, the use of MOG peptides or recombinant proteins representing part of the protein, fail to address the possible pathogenic role of the full-length myelin-derived protein expressing post-translational modifications. Immunisation with central nervous system (CNS) tissues from wild-type (WT) and MOGdeficient (MOG \u2212/\u2212 ) mice demonstrates that MOG in myelin is necessary for the development of chronic demyelinating experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice and marmosets since myelin from WT mice induces chronic EAE while from MOG \u2212/\u2212 myelin induced a mild selflimiting monophasic disease.",

Upon transfer to healthy recipients the cells induce massive CNS inflammation and severe paralytic disease. Using two-photon microscopy we visualize the behavior of retrovirally labeled MBP-specific T cells in the CNS of Lewis rats during different phases of clinical EAE. Imaging of intact animals and of acute spinal cord slices enabled us to track autoreactive effector T cells in meningeal/ perivasular areas as well as deep within the CNS parenchyma. We report here on two major findings: effector T cells redistribute in the course of EAE. In the primary clinical phase (days 2.5 after T cell transfer) the effector cells were restricted to perivascular locations. Beginning day 3 after transfer, however, they spread into the meninges and penetrated deeply into the CNS parenchyma. Their motility behavior profoundly changed over the course of EAE. T cell in the perivascular cuffs moved predominantly along the vessel walls. Cells within the CNS parenchyma moved seemingly non-directed. The cells displayed two distinct motility patterns: \"motile\" cells rapidly moved through the compact white matter, while \"stationary\" cells were attached and moved around a fixed anchor point. The ratio between these two fractions changed significantly over time. Whereas in early EAE the number of motile cells exceeded the one of the stationary cells this ratio became inverted during late EAE. During the last decade, we have witnessed unprecedented progress in the therapy of multiple sclerosis (MS). Despite the obvious benefit for clinical outcome, the new therapies have extensively tested the autoimmune concept of MS. Although evidence for autoimmune mechanisms in MS is largely indirect, proof can only be achieved by the demonstration that therapy based on the correction of immune deviation is able to restore neurological function. How do the drugs currently used in MS address this aim? Interferon beta and Glatiramer, the two most widely used immunomodulating drugs in MS, are effective in reducing disease activity only by 30%. Does it mean that the autoimmune concept is challenged or do immune mechanisms in MS require additional points of interception? The clinical heterogeneity of MS may imply that several independent mechanisms exist and these might need to be separately targeted. In this regard, the use of nonantigen specific immune therapies aimed at a common pathway during the generation of the immune response might overcome some difficulties related to the claimed heterogeneity of MS. However, the recent history of side effects induced by Natalizumab have shown that antigen non-specific therapy can culminate in the severe loss of immune surveillance. Therefore, more selective immune therapies based upon the antigen reactivity of specifically-defined cell subpopulations or an effector immune mediator, may offer more promise. An additional point of complexity in MS therapy has been raised by the demonstration that neurodegeneration and brain atrophy represent important pathologic events of this disease. Currently, several immune-related molecules are being tested in clinical trials in MS and in the near future we should become more knowledgeable on how a correction of the immune response at different levels influences the course of the disease.",

Background: Natalizumab therapy was recently associated with development of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a demyelinating disorder of the CNS caused by JC virus (JCV) infection. Design/Methods: Cell numbers and cellular phenotypes in CSF and PB were analyzed by flow cytometry in MS patients treated with natalizumab, untreated MS patients, patients with other neurological disease (OND), and HIV-infected patients. JCV DNA in the CSF and PB of these patient cohorts was quantified by kinetic PCR. Results: CSF total leukocyte counts, CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, CD19 + B cells and CD138 + plasma cells were significantly lower in natalizumab-treated MS patients compared with OND patients and untreated MS patients. Natalizumab therapy decreased the CD4:CD8 ratio in the CSF to levels similar to that of HIV-infected patients. JCV DNA was not detected in natalizumab-treated patients. Six months after cessation of therapy, low lymphocyte counts in the CSF persisted, whereas the CD4:CD8 ratio normalized. The patient with the highest total leukocyte, CD4 + and CD8 + T cell counts in the CSF experienced a clinical relapse. Interpretation: Our data suggest that a low CSF CD4:CD8 ratio in natalizumab-treated patients may confer an increased risk of developing PML.",

Instead, Daclizumab therapy was associated with a gradual decline in circulating CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and significant expansion of CD56 bright natural killer (NK) cells in vivo, and this effect correlated highly with the treatment response. In vitro studies showed that NK cells inhibited T cell survival in activated PBMC cultures by a contact-dependent mechanism. Moreover, CD56 bright NK cells isolated from Daclizumabtreated patients were directly cytotoxic to activated, but not resting autologous T cells in perforin-dependent manner. Positive correlations between expansion of CD56 bright NK cells and contractions of CD4 + and CD8 + T cell numbers in individual patients in vivo provides supporting evidence for NK-cell mediated negative immunoregulation of activated T cells during Daclizumab therapy.

Since CD4 + Foxp3 + T regulatory cells (Tregs) play roles in maintaining peripheral tolerance, it is important to determine if dysregulation of Tregs contributes to the onset and/or progression of MS. Although previous studies identified human Treg as CD4 + CD25 high cells, activated T cells also express CD25 molecule. To specifically assess the frequency of Tregs, we analyzed expression of Foxp3 by CD4 + CD25 + cells. Methods: PBMC were obtained from 19 consenting patients with MS and 13 healthy controls (HC). Among the patients enrolled, 11 patients were receiving IFN-beta therapy. Cells were stained with anti-human CD4 PE-Cy5 (RPA-T4) and anti-human CD25 PE (BC9), and then anti-Foxp3 FITC (PCH101) intracellularly. Expression of these molecules was determined by FACSCalibur. Results: CD4 + CD25 + cells were divided into CD25 low and CD25 high fractions. In HC samples, an average of 85% of CD4 + CD25 high expressed Foxp3, but a considerable number of Foxp3 + cells were also found among CD4 + CD25 low . In contrast, Foxp3-negative non-Tregs constituted more than 50% of CD4 + CD25 high in five patients on IFN-beta therapy and in one not receiving IFN-beta therapy. The proportion of Tregs in CD4 T cells in MS-PB was significantly decreased compared with that of HC-PB (2.83% vs. 5.51%, p < 0.05, t-test). Interestingly, IFN-beta therapy significantly increased the Treg frequency in MS-PB up to an average of 4.40% (p < 0.05, t-test). Discussion: We show a decrease in the frequency of circulating Tregs in MS. Of note, IFN-beta may partially reverse the deficit of Tregs in MS.",

Methods: We tried to evaluate the effect of exposure to C-Dps on nerve conduction after intraneural injection. Binding studies of C-Dps to rat neuronal tissues were performed. Furthermore, we evaluated the clustering of sodium channels at the node of Ranvier and the direct effect of C-Dps to sodium channels using the whole-cell patch-clamp method. Results: We found that (a) C-Dps, but neither PBS nor heat-denatured C-Dps, when injected into the rat sciatic nerve significantly decreased proximal-compound muscle action potential (CMAP), while motor conduction velocity did not change significantly, (b) C-Dps binds to the nodes of Ranvier and the outer surfaces of myelin sheath, (c) in the C-Dps injected sciatic nerve, immunostaining of the sodium channel was markedly decreased at the node of Ranvier, (d) C-Dps had no direct effect on sodium channels in the rat hippocampal CA1 neuron. Conclusions: C-Dps has direct neuro-toxicity mediated by the downregulation of sodium channels at node of Ranvier.

Experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN) is considered the in vivo model of GBS. There has been, however, no animal model of EAN which is induced by C. jejuni cell body antigen. We here report that a new form of EAN was successfully induced for the first time in animals by using C. jejuni cell body antigen. C. jejuni, Penner serotypes O:19, was isolated from the patient with GBS and cultured. EAN could be induced in Th1 bearing animals such as Lewis rats, SJL/J mice, and DBA/2 mice, but not be induced in Th2 bearing animals such as C57BL/6 mice by a single sensitization of C. jejuni cell body antigen in complete Freund's adjuvant. Animals with EAN develop limp tail to paraparesis. By histology inflammatory cell infiltration was observed in sciatic nerves, especially in perineurium, and cauda equine. Immunohistological study showed that infiltrated cells were ED1, a marker of macrophage, positive.

            "text": "\"Readthrough\" acetylcholinesterase facilitates inflammation associated neuropathies in an antisense suppressible manner Inflammatory factors that penetrate through a disrupted blood-nerve barrier may play a common pathophysiological role in various neuropathies. Disruption of the blood-nerve barrier concomitant to induction of systemic inflammation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration caused a transient conduction block in rats. LPS administration leads to proteolytic cleavage of the stress-induced \"readthrough\" acetylcholinesterase variant (AChE-R), and accumulation of its distinct cleavable C-terminal peptide (ARP). We therefore examined the involvement of AChE-R and ARP in inflammation-associated nerve conduction impairments. Dissociated rat splenocytes were reacted in vitro with Campylobacter jejuni (Cj) or E. coli LPS. Cell-free reactive splenocyte medium was injected intra-neuronally to rat sciatic nerves. Medium from untreated splenocytes served for control. Compound muscle action potentials recorded from the intrinsic foot muscles following stimulation proximal-and distal to the injection site were recorded, and the proximal-to-distal amplitude ratio (PDR) was calculated, representing conduction efficiency. Nerve segments that include the injection site were collected for analyses. AChE-R mRNA was identified by in situ hybridization within the cytoplasm of Schwann cell bodies, and myelin sheaths. Immunohistochemistry identified ARP within the cytoplasm of Schwann cells, and additionally within axons. Intra-neural injection of reactive splenocyte medium induced a transient PDR reduction, accompanied by ARP accumulation. Intra-neural injection of synthetic ARP induced a similar reduction in PDR. Furthermore, systemic treatment with an antisense oligonucleotide, EN101, which suppresses AChE-R expression attenuated conduction block formation following intra-neural reactive splenocyte medium injection. Thus AChE-R and ARP may play a key role in inflammation-associated neuropathies, and EN101 might emerge as a novel treatment for such neuropathies.",

These results suggest that although MAC has a role in demyelination and the overall pathogenesis of the disease, but not essentially a sole factor to these processes. The roles of autoantibodies in central nervous system (CNS) diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, are not clear, but there is increasing evidence for specific autoantibodies to neuronal proteins as markers for other paraneoplastic and non-paraneoplastic neurological diseases. Onconeural antibodies are usually measured by indirect immunohistochemistry/ immunofluorescence but can also be measured by commercial immunoblotting tests. The antibodies (to Hu, Yo, Ri, Ma/Ta, CRMP5/CV2, Amphiphysin, Tr) are highly disease specific, are often found at very high titer, and usually indicate the presence of a particular tumour (e.g. small cell lung cancer, ovarian etc.). However, there are many unanswered questions concerning their relevance; for instance, most of the onconeural antibodies are not thought to be pathogenic and the associated diseases are likely caused by cytotoxic T cells. Whether these are controlled by specific regulatory cells is one question that needs to be answered. There are also several non-paraneoplastic conditions in which there are potentially causative antibodies. Voltage-gated potassium channel antibodies are associated with (usually non-paraneoplastic) peripheral and CNS disorders and are likely to be pathogenic, although this has not been proved for the CNS disorders. Glutamate receptor antibodies can activate the receptors and mimic excess glutamate, leading to neuronal loss. Enolase antibodies are being identified in several diseases (Hashimoto's, retinopathies) and may induce calcium release from internal stores. In addition, there are a number of other antibodies, and techniques employed to identify further specificities in serum and CSF, that should prove useful in the future.",

HE presents with various neuropsychiatric features. The detection of anti-thyroid antibodies in patient sera is helpful but not sufficient for the diagnosis of HE because of the high prevalence in the normal population. Recently, we reported autoantibodies against the amino (NH 2 )-terminal region of alpha-enolase (NAE) as a useful diagnostic marker of HE. Methods: We performed immunoblotting analyses of patient's serum against recombinant NAE. We investigated the prevalence of anti-NAE autoantibodies in the sera from 25 patients with HE, and examined their clinical features, laboratory and MRI findings. Results: Patients with HT, who showed encephalopathy with the presence of anti-thyroid antibodies and steroid-responsiveness, demonstrated a high prevalence of anti-NAE autoantibodies in their sera from HE (68%, 17 of 25), compared to a low prevalence in HT without encephalopathy (10%, 2 of 20) (p < 0.001) and absence in other autoimmune conditions. Consciousness disturbance, seizures, cognitive impairment and EEG abnormalities were common. The patients with anti-NAE autoantibodies showed good steroid-responsiveness and a high prevalence of abnormality on EEG (100%).",

In this study, we found that anti-enolase antibodies significantly reduced the cytosolic ATP when retinal neurons were grown with anti-enolase antibody. In addition, by measuring the level of intracellular calcium in retinal cells treated with patients' anti-enolase IgGs, we found that IgGs were potent inducers of intracellular calcium increase. Normal IgG did not induce intracellular calcium or reduce cytosolic ATP. Using calcium blockers, glycolytic inhibition by anti-enolase antibodies led to a sudden release of endoplasmic-stored Ca 2+ .

We have established an experimental system to identify the antigen specificity of OCB, which are the product of oligoclonally expanded CSF plasma cells. Starting from single cell RT PCR of individual CSF plasma cells we identified expanded clones and expressed their heavy and light Ig chain genes as recombinant human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) in a eukaryotic expression system. Using immunoprecipitation of Bb lysate and subsequent MALDI analysis we could identify the antigen specificity of the derived mAb to be directed against the p41 antigen of Bb. We could show that the affinity of this patient derived human mAb is 1000 times higher to native Bb lysate than to denatured recombinant p41. Our results demonstrate on the one hand the validity of our experimental system in resurrecting the original antigen specificity of expanded CSF plasma cell clones, which can be instrumental in the elucidation of the antigen specificity of OCB in MS and related diseases.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an animal model of the human disease multiple sclerosis (MS). EAE is thought to be mediated by Th1 cells that secrete proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 and lymphotoxin, although T cells that secrete IL-17 are also thought to play a role in disease pathogenesis. Given their central role in disease pathogenesis, T cells represent an excellent target for regulation and potential therapies. We have been interested in the pathways that regulate the development of inflammation in inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) diseases. In EAE, we have shown that silencing T-bet, a transcription factor important in Th1 cell differentiation, can suppress EAE development. We have also investigated members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, such as peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR)-\u03b1, and their ability to regulate CNS inflammation. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we show that PPAR\u03b1 can bind the regulatory regions of the IL-4 and IL-5 genes and promote secretion of these cytokines. Using the PPAR\u03b1 agonist gemfibrozil, we can demonstrate receptor-dependent increases in GATA-3, IL-4 and IL-5 and inhibition of T-bet and IFN-\u03b3. These data suggest that targeting the transcriptional regulation of T cell differentiation could be a successful therapeutic strategy in immune-mediated CNS inflammatory diseases. Objective: To investigate whether experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) protection by atorvastatin (AT) requires STAT6-mediated Th2 differentiation. Background: AT prevents and reverses EAE and is currently tested for multiple sclerosis treatment. Several EAE studies reported a Th2 differentiation of myelin reactive T cells under AT treatment with an upregulation of STAT6 signaling which controls Th2 differentiation. In order to elucidate the clinical significance of AT-mediated Th2 differentiation we evaluated AT-treatment in STAT6-knockout (\u2212/\u2212) mice. Methods: C57BL/6 STAT6 \u2212/\u2212 mice were fed orally with 1 or 10 mg/kg/d AT starting either 2 days prior to immunization or after MOG p35-55 EAE was established. Mice treated for EAE prevention were evaluated for proliferation and cytokine secretion of MOG p35-55-specific T cells. Na\u00efve T cells from B10.PL IL-4-GFP reporter mice were differentiated into Th2 or Th1 cells as distinguished by FACS (IL4-GFP \u2192 Th2). Resting Th1 and Th2 cells were stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 in the presence of AT. Results: AT treatment could effectively prevent and reverse EAE in STAT6 \u2212/\u2212 mice comparable to its treatment effect in C57BL/6 wild-type mice. MOG p35-55-specific proliferation and secretion of IFN-g, TNF-a was reduced in T cells from AT-treated STAT6 \u2212/\u2212 mice. In vitro, AT inhibited proliferation of both Th1 and Th2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusions: Our data indicate that AT can prevent and reverse EAE independent of STAT6-mediated Th2 differentiation. Other mechanisms besides Th2 differentiation, including the inhibitory effect on T cell proliferation and Th1 differentiation reported here significantly contribute to the therapeutic effect of AT in EAE.",

We found that feeding anti-CD3 antibody suppresses PLP induced EAE in SJL mice via induction of regulatory T cells that function in a TGF-\u03b2 dependent fashion (Nature Medicine, in press). We investigated the effect of oral anti-CD3 in MOG induced EAE in NOD mice which develop a relapsing-remitting followed by a progressive course that occurs in MS. As in SJL mice, oral anti-CD3 (5 \u03bcg/feeding) suppressed MOG induced EAE in NOD mice. We then studied oral anti-CD-3 in IFN-\u03b3 \u2212/\u2212 and IL-10 \u2212/\u2212 NOD mice. IFN-\u03b3 \u2212/\u2212 NOD mice developed severe EAE with an exacerbated disease pattern which was not ameliorated by oral anti CD-3. IL-10 \u2212/\u2212 NOD mice developed a mild relapsing disease which was exacerbated by oral anti-CD3. Wild type NOD mice fed with 5 \u03bcg anti-CD3 showed decreased IL-2 and IL-6 secretion and increased TGF-\u03b2 compared to control IgG. IFN-\u03b3 \u2212/\u2212 NOD mice secreted increased IL-2 and IL-6 and decreased TGF-\u03b2 whereas IL-10 \u2212/\u2212 NOD mice had decreased IL-6 and no increase in TGF-\u03b2. Oral anti-CD3 had no effect on MOG specific IFN-\u03b3 secretion in either NOD or IL-10 \u2212/\u2212 NOD mice. These results demonstrate that EAE disease patterns in the NOD mice are affected by deficiencies in IFN and IL-10 and that the inability of oral anti-CD3 to suppress EAE appears linked to the inability to induce regulation by TGF-\u03b2 in these mice.",

The administration of the mAb ameliorated EAE both in a preventive and therapeutic setting. When CD4 + CD25 + Treg cells were depleted in vivo before superagonist administration the protective effect was abolished, demonstrating the importance of these cells as mechanistic link for the protective effect of the CD28 superagonist. In cases where the depletion of Treg was incomplete, however, the CD28 superagonist restored the CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + Treg compartment within 3 days to more than normal levels indicating its potency in Treg activation and expansion in vivo. Adoptive transfer experiments using lymphocytes either from GFP transgenic mice or labeled with CFSE revealed that the expansion of the Treg compartment was not due to conversion of CD4 + CD25 \u2212 T cells into CD4 + CD25 + Treg cells but rather the result of rapid proliferation of pre-existing Tregs.",

SiRNA-T-bet or siRNA-Nonsense (siRNA-NS) were administered intravenously at 2 timepoints to B10.PL mice that had developed EAE after adoptive transfer of encephalitogenic T cells. Splenocytes isolated from mice treated with siRNA T-bet produced less IFN-\u03b3, had reduced IL-23R expression than mice treated with siRNA-NS. CXCR3 expression was not affected. To examine genes that may be trans-activated by T-bet in vivo, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed. T-bet bound to the IL-23R promoter but not the CXCR3 promoter. Engagement of the IL-23R on IL-23R + T cells results in IL-17 secretion and IL-17 expression in the CNS of siRNA-T-bet mice was decreased. Examination of immune cells present in the CNS of these mice by multi-parameter flow cytometry indicate that both IL-17 and IFN-\u03b3 may be produced by CD45 + CD4 + CNS cells. The percentage of T cells able to release IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17 are reduced in mice treated with si-RNA T-bet. These data indicate that amelioration of ongoing EAE via suppression of T-bet may result in anti-inflammatory environment in the CNS due to decreased IL-23R expression and reduced IL-17 and IFN-\u03b3 secretion. There has been longstanding interest in how B cell responses may contribute to the pathology of neurological diseases. Traditionally, the premise has been that any such contribution relates to the potential of B cells to produce auto-pathogenic antibodies. Targeting autoantibodies continues to be an important therapeutic approach, particularly in disorders where the role of antibodies is well established, such as in myasthenia gravis. In other conditions such as multiple sclerosis, the role of circulating antibodies has been less clear, though pathologic studies continue to implicate CNS-reactive antibodies, as well as B cells within the CNS compartment. Recently, new insights into fundamental properties of B cells have suggested that these cells may contribute in an antibody-independent fashion, both to normal immune responses, as well as in the context of immune mediated diseases. This session and the associated posters will consider the roles of humoral immune responses, as well as antibody-independent B cell involvement in several neurological disorders. Also covered will be consideration of the roles and therapeutic mechanisms of action of existing therapies such as IVIG, as well as emerging approaches in which B cells are targeted more selectively.",

However, the mechanism of action of IVIG treatment and the fraction responsible for its therapeutic effect in autoimmune diseases are still not established. We have been studying the therapeutic effects of IVIG administration in experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG), a rat model for myasthenia gravis. We showed that IVIG treatment could successfully prevent the induction of EAMG and immunosuppress an ongoing disease. The mechanism by which IVIG modulates EAMG involves suppression of Th1 cells and B cell proliferation but probably does not act via regulatory T cells.",

            "text": "After establishing the optimal conditions for EAMG suppression by IVIG administrations we have employed this model in an attempt to isolate a specific suppressive fraction from IVIG preparation and to identify its therapeutic activity. We have demonstrated that chromatography of human IVIG on immobilized rat anti-AChR IgG, isolated from rats with EAMG, results in a complete depletion of the suppressive activity of the IVIG. Moreover, the eluted immunoglobulin fraction that had been adsorbed onto the anti-AChR antibodies and comprises less than 1/100,000 of the IVIG preparation retains the immunosuppressive activity of IVIG. This study supports the notion that the therapeutic effect of IVIG is mediated by an antigen-specific anti-immunoglobulin activity (anti-idiotypic activity) present in pooled human immunoglobulin and raises the possibility that diseasespecific anti-idiotypic activity can be fractionated from IVIG and become a preferential reagent for therapeutic purposes. Objective: CIDP can improve after intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment. Most patients need intermittent IVIg to maintain improvement. This study aims to identify factors especially in relation to long-term treatment and prognosis. Methods: Data were collected from all CIDP patients known at the Erasmus Medical Center, treated with IVIg and followed for at least 2 months. 50 clinical and laboratory parameters were analyzed for a possible relation with improvement (Rankin scale). Results: 64 males and 31 females were followed for a period ranging from 2.5 months to 20 years (median 4.0 years). 15 patients received additional treatment to reduce the amount of IVIg. 77/95 (81%) patients improved after IVIg. 66/77 (86%) patients needed at least 2 courses, suggesting that improvement was not due to spontaneous remission. Improvement was related with a relapse in the past (all 12 patients improved), progressive weakness until treatment and no discrepancy in weakness between arms and legs. Mean time on IVIg treatment until remission was 3.5 years (median 2.1 years). Patients with sensory-motor disturbances (p = 0.002 HR 3.2) and a relative short duration of weakness (p = 0.008; HR 2.6) had a higher chance to reach remission after discontinuation of IVIg. 10% needed IVIg for a period over 8.7 years (maximum over 20 years). Severe side-effects were not seen. Conclusion: Most patients need IVIg for a long period of time. Patients with prognostic factors indicating the necessity for long-term treatment may be consideredespecially due to the high costs of IVIgto switch treatment in an early stage of disease.",

Objectives: To investigate the effects of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIgs) on nerve excitability in patients with multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction blocks (MMN) or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathies (CIDP). Methods: 16 patients (9 MMN, 7 CIDP) were evaluated before and after IVIgs (0.4 g/kg/day for 5 consecutive days). Absolute (ARP), relative refractory period (RRP) durations and percentages of refractoriness at 2 ms and supernormality at 7 ms interstimuli intervals were determined. Stimulus/response (S/R) and strength/duration (S/D) curves were established. Activity-dependent hyperpolarisation induced by voluntary contraction was appraised on the percentage of conduction block in affected territories. Results: Before IVIgs, patients had longer refractoriness and smaller supernormality than healthy subjects. IVIgs increased refractoriness (78.1 \u00b1 5.8 vs. 69.0 \u00b1 6.7%, p = 0.04) and prolonged RRP (3.1 \u00b1 0.2 vs. 3.8 \u00b1 0.3 ms, p = 0.05) but did not modify ARP duration and supernormality. The SD time constant decreased (242.7 \u00b1 35.6 vs. 352.7 \u00b1 45.2 \u03bcs, p = 0.04), while rheobase and S/R curve slope remained unchanged. IVIgs reduced the percentage of activity-dependent conduction block (11.5 \u00b1 0.7 vs.\u2212 5.6 \u00b1 0.6%, p = 0.002). Conclusion: This electrophysiological study provides additional information to usual conduction studies. The refractoriness prolongation is consistent with changes in Na + conductance or nodal membrane properties, suggesting a reduction in intraaxonal Na + accumulation, decreasing the occurrence of hyperpolarisation. While the reduction of percentage of conduction block traduced an improvement in Na + /K + ATPase pump function and a greater conduction. This study revealed potential protective effects of IVIg and improved conduction across conduction blocks in CIDP and MMN. Objective: To examine whether (1) a novel B cell regulatory cytokine network is influenced by the local Th1 or Th2 environment in patients with MS and controls (2) such modulation can be targeted therapeutically. Methods: Circulating CD19 + B cells were purified from untreated MS patients (Poser criteria) and matched healthy controls, then stimulated with B cell receptor engagement followed by CD40 stimulation. Modulation of B cell responses by the local T cell environment was assessed by addition of IFN\u03b3 (Th1) or IL-4 (Th2). B cell proliferation (thymidine incorporation) and TNF\u03b1, LT and IL-10 (ELISA) were subsequently measured. Results: B cell proliferation was no different between MS and controls, under all stimulation conditions. IL-4 addition generally enhanced B cell cytokine production, as expected, with no differences in TNF\u03b1 production between MS and controls. Upon addition of IFN\u03b3, MS patient B cells produced significantly more TNF\u03b1 and LT compared to control B cells; IL-10 production was not different. Interestingly, following mitoxantrone therapy in MS patients, the addition of IFN\u03b3 during MS B cell stimulation was now associated with significantly less TNF\u03b1 and LT induction compared to baseline data.",

            "text": "Lipid microdomain-mediated signaling: Implications for anti-MOG mediated demyelinating disease Antibodies to myelin components are routinely detected in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. We find that antibody cross-linking in oligodendrocytes (OLs) of myelin proteins MOG or MAG results in (a) their rapid repartitioning into glycosphingolipid-cholesterol microdomains ('lipid rafts' 1,2 , small (nm) membrane entities with few proteins, which upon ligand-or antibody-mediated cross-linking can coalesce into functional signal transduction \"activation centers\"; high cholesterol/glycosphingolipid content in OLs/myelin suggested that rafts contribute functionally to their physiology.), followed by (b) raft-dependent phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of specific proteins and downstream events, and in the case of MOG, (c) dramatic, rapid loss of myelin-like membrane. 3 Immunization of C57BL/ 6 mice with either rat or human MOG produces comparable anti-MOG ELISA titers, however, only human MOG yields B cell dependent EAE and is encephalitogenic in primed B cell deficient mice. Substituting Pro42 with Ser in human MOG (as in rat MOG) eliminates this B cell requirement; nonpathogenic IgGs bind recombinant mouse MOG and deglycosylated MOG in myelin, but only pathogenic IgGs bind glycosylated MOG; only purified IgG to human MOG binds to live rodent OLs in culture and, after crosslinking, induce repartitioning of MOG into lipid rafts and dramatic changes in cell morphology. 3 These data provide a strong link between in vivo and in vitro observations regarding demyelinating disease, further suggesting a biochemical mechanism for anti-MOG-induced demyelination, and suggest in vitro tools for determining autoimmune Ab pathogenicity in MS. 1 Kim and Pfeiffer (1999); Taylor et al.

This symposium, \"Studies in Neuroimmune Pharmacology\", represents some of the broad interests of this 'new' interdiscipline. Data on effects of opiates in a monkey model of AIDS show statistically meaningful evidence that opiates modulate AIDS disease progression. These data have considerable implication for opiate addicts infected with HIV1. Data are also presented that show that mu opiate-receptor ligands induce desensitization of the chemokine receptor, CCR5, on macrophages via phoshorylation of protein kinase-C. These fundamental data are important to the role of opiates in neuroimmune function and HIV/AIDS. Similarly, the signal transduction mechanisms involved in stimulation of lymphocytes through delta-opioid T-cell surface receptors are presented, which further elaborates how opioids interact directly with cells of the immune system at the basic molecular level. A human immune-reconstituted mouse model is also used to show that the anti-HIV drug, indinavir, can be delivered effectively via a nanoparticle packaged into bone-marrow derived macrophages as drug carriers. This novel model offers new approaches and new hope for treatment of HIV/AIDS. Finally, structural MRI, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and positron emission tomography studies were used in humans to show neurological changes in HIV1-infected subjects who also use cocaine and methamphetamines. These studies reveal drugspecific neurologic changes that associate with neurobehavioral, motor and cognitive functions in the patients studied. These combined data show the promise of neuroimmune pharmacology to advance understanding of major medical problems and the means to their resolution.",

The present study examined the signaling events mediating the inactivation of CCR5 by pre-treatment with [D-Ala-N-Me-Phe4-Gly-ol] enkephalin (DAMGO), a MOR-selective agonist. Cell lines, stably-transfected with MOR and CCR5, and human monocyte-derived macrophages were treated with DAMGO (10 \u2212 6 M) and used in various assays. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses showed that PKC\u03b6 associates with CCR5 and that DAMGO induced phosphorylation of PDK-1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1), a kinase that is known to activate PKC\u03b6. In addition, DAMGO augmented the kinase activity of PKC\u03b6 observed upon immuno-precipitation of CCR5 and induced phosphorylation of CCR5. Cells transfected with PKC\u03b6 siRNA showed a significant inhibition of PKC\u03b6 kinase activity associated with CCR5. In further studies, desensitization of CCR5 led to inhibition of calcium mobilization and decreased chemotactic response to Mip1-beta. Use of a PKC\u03b6 pseudosubstrate inhibitor reversed these results. Overall, the data suggest that DAMGO-induced desensitization of CCR5 leads to phosphorylation of CCR5 and that PKC\u03b6 mediates this effect. This work was supported by NIDA grants DA16544, DA06654, DA14230, and P30-DA13429. Opiate use has been reported to retard or advance AIDS progression, or to have no detectable effect. Human clinical and monkey SIV-model studies have contributed to this equivocation. A small pilot monkey study from our laboratory suggested that opiate-dependency retards AIDS progression. Results of a nearly 5-yr follow-up study confirm this original observation. Male rhesus macaques at around 4 yr of age were adapted over a 1-1/2-yr period to a single-cage holding environment with psychological enrichments. Baseline data were collected, followed by introduction of an opiate-dependency paradigm (4 daily, 6-h apart, sc/im injections of morphine sulphate, 3-2 mg/kg/monkey). Nineteen monkeys received opiate while 17 received equivalent, weight-by-volume, injections of saline as controls. Two weeks after initiation of these injections, all monkeys were injected iv with 10,000 TCID 50 of SIVsmm9. Progression of infection and disease was followed for 4 yr thereafter. Morphine retarded progression of AIDS overall (P V 0.05), being largely selective for monkeys that progressed relatively rapidly to AIDS. Opiatedependency also altered cerebral spinal inflammation. Retardation of disease progression corresponded with an ability of opiates to reverse the negative correlation typically seen as viral load increases over time in conjunction with CD4 + T-cell loss. These data represent the most solid evidence to date that opiates alter AIDS progression. In view of conflicting data that opiates exacerbate AIDS progression, current understanding of this issue supports our prior conjecture that the influence of opiates on AIDS is conditionalbeing dependent on variable drugdependency, viral and immune states, and possibly relating to the influence of these factors over stress. Such findings and conclusions support a need for more thorough understanding of how opiates affect AIDS progression in drug-abusing populations. Opioids modulate an array of functional responses by T-cells, including proliferation, cytokine production, chemotaxis and expression of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV). However, the signaling pathways mediating these effects of opioids have been largely unknown. Recently, we observed that delta opioid ligands exert dual effects on specific T-cell signaling cascades; as such, the opioid itself stimulates, whereas opioid pretreatment attenuates the signaling response to another agent. For example, brief exposure (15 min) to a specific delta opioid agonist (i.e., DADLE) dose-dependently induced phosphorylation of c-jun by activating phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (Akt) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). Moreover, DADLE stimulated the phosphorylation of activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2; implicated in cytokine gene transcription) and its association with JNK. In contrast to such direct activation of PI3K/Akt-dependent signaling, pretreatment with DADLE inhibited Akt phosphorylation induced by stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1). Pretreatment of highly purified human peripheral blood T-cells with DADLE for 1 or 3 h, significantly reduced SDF-1-induced Akt phosphorylation by approximately 60% (n = 7). In contrast, DADLE failed to stimulate phosphorylation of the MAPKs, ERK1 and 2, and did not affect SDF-1-induced ERK phosphorylation. Recent studies also demonstrate that morphine inhibited Akt phosphorylation stimulated by SDF-1. Together, these studies demonstrate that endogenous and exogenous opioids can exert both direct and indirect modulatory effects on signaling cascades that depend on PI3K/Akt.",

ABSTRACT The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy for human immunodeficiency virus infection has all but revolutionized pharmacologic management of human disease. Nonetheless, complex dosing regimens, costs, untoward side effects, limited bio distribution and variable drug pharmacokinetic patterns have affected long-term use and notably, clinical efficacy, within the nervous system. We posit that nanotechnology-derived cell based systems may overcome such limitations. In a first step towards testing this idea, we developed a nanoparticle indinavir (NP-IDV) formulation packaged into bone-marrow-derived-macrophages (BMM) as drug carriers. Drug distribution and disease outcomes were assessed in immune competent and in non-obese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient mice (NOD/SCID) reconstituted with human peripheral blood lymphocytes. In the model, NP-IDV contained within BMM was adoptively transferred into mice. After a single administration, single photon emission computed tomography and histology demonstrated robust lung, liver, and spleen BMM distributions. Tissue and sera IDV levels were z50 nM/ml up to 2 weeks of observation. NP-IDV-BMM administered to virus-challenged immunodeficient humanized mice showed reduced numbers of virusinfected cells in plasma, lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and lung. Numbers of CD4 + T cells were restored after NP-IDV-BMM administration. NOD/SCID mice with active HIV-1 encephalitis showed robust delivery of NP-IDV to affect brain subregions. We conclude that a single dose of NP-IDV using BMM as a carrier is bio-available and effective and warrants consideration for human testing.",

            "text": "Basal ganglia abnormalities in HIV patients and chronic psychostimulant drug users L. Chang, T. Ernst University of Hawaii, Honolulu, USA A variety of in vivo physiological neuroimaging techniques can quantitatively assess brain injury associated with HIV and/or substance abuse. Structural MRI demonstrates atrophy of caudate and putamen in subjects infected with HIV, but enlarged striatal volumes in those with chronic psychostimulant abuse (methamphetamine, cocaine, etc.). Hence HIV and psychostimulant use have opposite effects on brain volumes. Conversely, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) shows metabolite abnormalities that are additive in HIV patients and methamphetamine users. These spectroscopic abnormalities include decreased neuronal marker N-acetylasparate and elevated glial marker myoinositol, most prominently in the basal ganglia and frontal cortex. Since psychomotor slowing and attention deficits are major features of HIV dementia and psychostimulant abuse, dopamine dysfunction has been postulated. Dopaminergic terminals and synapses have the highest density in the basal ganglia regions. Positron emission tomography studies (with C-11 cocaine) indeed illustrate lower dopamine transporters in HIV patients with dementia, as well as individuals with chronic methamphetamine dependence, compared to seronegative non-drug users. Correlations between cognitive performance and dopamine transporter levels document the functional consequences of dopaminergic deficits. These findings suggest that methamphetamine and cocaine abuse further exacerbate brain injury in HIV patients. Therefore, dopamine augmentation might be beneficial in the treatment of HIV dementia. Collectively, findings from these neuroimaging studies provide insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of HIV-associated brain injury and drug abuse, and might lead to new therapeutic approaches.",

            "text": "We recently discovered that the vagus nerve can control peripheral innate immune responses through a mechanism that can be employed for the treatment of inflammatory disorders [Nat Rev DD 4:673, 2005] . Electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve attenuates systemic inflammation in experimental sepsis by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the spleen through a mechanism dependent on the common celiac branch. Vagus nerve stimulation fails to attenuate endotoxininduced serum TNF levels in splenectomized animals. Acetylcholine, the principal neurotransmitter of the vagus nerve, inhibits endotoxin-induced TNF and HMGB1 release from human macrophages through a mechanism dependent on the \u03b17-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (\u03b17nAChr). In vivo, vagus nerve stimulation reduces splenic TNF protein and mRNA levels in wild-type mice, but not in \u03b17nAChr-knockout mice. Nicotine, a more selective cholinergic agonist, abolished HMGB1 release in a dose-dependent manner, and it was a more efficient inhibitor of macrophages. In vivo, treatment with nicotine attenuated serum HMGB1 levels, prevented lethal endotoxemia, and improved survival in established polymicrobial peritonitis, even when the treatment was started after the appearance of the clinical signs of sepsis. Nicotine has already been used in clinical trials for inflammatory disorders such as ulcerative colitis, but its clinical potential is limited by its collateral toxicity. Similar to the development of selective agonists for adrenergic receptors, selective nicotinic agonists for the \u03b17nAChR may represent a promising pharmacological strategy for infectious and inflammatory diseases. This research was supported by the Faculty Awards Program of the NS-LIJHS, NIGMS, and DARPA. Three broad questions have driven research into the immune response to HTLV-1. First, how does HTLV-1 persist in the individual host? In particular, what is the role of the immune response in controlling or limiting viral persistence? Second, why do some HTLV-1-infected people develop a consequent disease such as HAM/TSP or leukaemia, whereas the majority remain asymptomatic carriers of the virus? Is this difference in the outcome of infection due primarily to variation in the host or variation in the virus? Third, how is the inflammatory lesion in HAM/TSP initiated and maintained, and how can the inflammation be halted? Evidence on the immune response to HTLV-1 will be summarized from recent work in host and viral genetics, DNA expression microarrays, T-cell function and cell biology. This evidence favours two main conclusions: first, that the efficiency of a person's cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response to HTLV-1 plays a dominant role in determining that person's proviral load of HTLV-1 and the risk of the associated inflammatory diseases; second, that HTLV-1 is persistently transcriptionally active and spreads directly between lymphocytes by a specialized cell-cell contact known as the virological synapse. Until recently, the inference that HTLV-1 is persistently transcribed rested entirely on evidence from in vitro experiments. However, new evidence from quantification of lymphocyte turnover in vivo strongly supports the view that there is persistent transcription of HTLV-1. These conclusions have implications for therapeutic approaches both in the inflammatory diseases and in the HTLV-1-associated syndrome of adult T-cell leukaemia, and in the immune response to persistent viral infections.",

We have previously reported that HLA-DRB1 \u204e 0101 was associated with susceptibility to HAM/TSP in two independent HTLV-I infected cohort in Southern Japan (Kagoshima) and Northeastern Iran (Mashhad), whereas HTLV-1 envelope gp21-specific T cells were restricted by DRB1 \u204e 0101.

Methods: A total of 273 cases from 91 medical institutions were registered into the survey. So far, 167 cases had been evaluated for safety and 152 for efficacy. The efficacy evaluation was rated based on clinical symptoms of HAM. Results: The rate of response to the treatment (rated as improved and fair) at 4 weeks was 67.1%. Factors which significantly affected efficacy at 4 weeks was initial Osame's motor disability score (OMDS) before interferon-\u03b1 therapy, duration and stage of illness. Sustained improvement of OMDS for at least 5 months after stopping interferon-\u03b1 was observed in 11 of 30 patients (36.7%). A total of 536 adverse drug reactions (ADRs) occurred in 146 patients, 46 of which were serious. The incidence of ADRs was higher than that of a previously reported controlled trial, although no specific ADRs occurred in patients with HAM. Conclusions: These results indicate that interferon-\u03b1 treatment is effective for at least patients in the incipient stage of HAM, though the incidence of ADRs is rather high. Long-term administration of interferon-\u03b1 may have some advantage in maintaining the improved condition during treatment. Thus, the most suitable protocol for interferon-\u03b1 administration in HAM needs to be defined in the future.",

SIV infection in rhesus macaques parallels human HIV infection, including on development of CNS disease. Neurophysiological alterations allow recognition of early signs of CNS dysfunction. The analysis of alterations on immune-cells in the brain in correlation with CNS dysfunction, show a remarkable 5-15-fold increase of highly activated memory CD3 + CD8 + CTLs in infected brains. The specificity of these cells was investigated. We found that >50% of brain CTLs recognize immunodominant epitopes Tat and Gag in monkeys with MamuA\u204e01 MHC haplotype. In the blood and CSF, Tat-specific cells peak during the acute phase, and become undetectable thereafter. However, in the brain, these cells remain as a large proportion of accumulating CTLs. We hypothesize that virusspecific cells enter the brain during acute phase, and are maintained to chronic stages. At 28 dpi, the enrichment of Tat and Gag-specific cells in the brain was already observed, suggesting an early entry. Factors favoring CD8 survival, such as IL2, IL7 and IL15, were examined. IL2 and IL7 were undetectable, but IL15 increased by 3-5 fold in SIVinfected brains. In vitro, IL15 efficiently supported CD8 survival, increased Ki-67+ cycling cells, and those expressing memory markers. Our results suggest that IL15-rich brain environment supports survival of SIV-specific and bystander memory CTLs. Taken together, increased IL15 levels in infected brains favor activated pro-inflammatory virus-specific CTLs, which enter the brain during the acute phase, and persist, potentially participating on development of inflammatory pathology.",

Tsunoda a , T. Tanaka a , Y. Saijoh b , S. E. Doyle a , E. J. Terry a , and R. S. Fujinami a Departments of Neurology a , and Neurobiology and Anatomy b , University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA In Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection, an animal model for multiple sclerosis (MS), axonal injury precedes inflammatory demyelination. The distribution of axonal injury during the early phase corresponds to regions where subsequent demyelination occurs during the chronic phase. We hypothesized that axonal injury recruits inflammatory cells into sites of Wallerian degeneration, leading to demyelination. In this scenario, lesions develop from the axon (inside) to the myelin (outside) (Inside-Out model). We have established a method for induction of Wallerian degeneration in the central nervous system (CNS). This approach uses toxic lectin, Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA) I, and does not lead to a blood-brain barrier breakdown. The lectin is injected into the sciatic nerve and is transported axonally, leading to the death of dorsal root ganglion cells and Wallerian degeneration of the posterior funiculus in the spinal cord. Using a microinjection system, we injected lectin into the sciatic nerve of SJL/J mice, 3 weeks after TMEV infection. Neuropathology was examined, 1 week after lectin injection. Control mice, which received TMEV but no lectin, had inflammatory demyelinating lesions only in the anterior and lateral funiculi. In contrast, lectin-injected infected mice had lesions in the anterior and lateral funiculi as well as in the posterior funiculus, where the lesions were present only ipsilateral to the injection side. We found no differences in anti-TMEV lymphoproliferative responses between groups. This suggests that axonal injury itself could contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the CNS by altering the local microenvironment, such as activating microglia. Recent studies showed that neural precursor cells (NPCs) attenuate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) after intracerebroventricular or intravenous (IV) injection. NPC therapy in EAE was associated with a decrease in brain inflammation and in tissue injury. Here we studied the mechanism by which IV injected NPCs inhibit myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced EAE in C57BL/6 mice. IV NPC therapy at 8 days post EAE induction attenuated the clinical course of EAE, and reduced brain inflammation and tissue injury. Microscopical analysis revealed that NPCs did not enter the brain, but were detected in lymph nodes and spleen. The direct interactions between NPCs and lymph node cells (LNC) were examined in vitro. Co-culture experiments showed that neurospheres attenuated significantly the proliferation of EAE-derived T-cells in response to MOG, as well as of na\u00efve T-cells, in response to the non-specific activator ConA. Neurospheres also inhibited MOG-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines in LNCs. Analysis of CFSE emission descent, IL2R\u03b1 expression, DNA content and Annexin-V expression indicated that NPCs block T-cell activation and proliferation, rather than induce LNC death. Finally, to examine the relevance of NPC-LNC interactions in vivo, we utilized a proteolipid (PLP)-induced transfer EAE model in SJL/J mice. Transfer of LNCs derived from NPC-treated, PLP-immunized mice into na\u00efve recipients caused a significantly milder disease than transfer of LNCs from non-treated mice. This indicated that NPC therapy reduces the encephalitogenicity of LNCs. Our findings suggest a peripheral immunosuppressive effect of IV-injected NPCs, by a non-specific inhibitory effect on activation and proliferation of lymphocytes in the lymph nodes.",

After systemic transplantation, aNPCs enter brain and spinal cord, selectively reach inflamed CNS areasthe \"atypical perivascular niches\"where major stem cell regulators are focally (re)expressedand survive in vivo for up to 120 days after transplantation. To further explore the immunomodulatory properties of adult neural precursor cells (aNPCs) in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), we have intravenously (i.v.)-injected syngenic aNPCs into mice with the relapsing-remitting form of the disease. SJL female mice were immunized subcutaneously with proteolipid protein (PLP)139-151 and i.v. injected with syngenic aNPCs at the onset of the disease.

In vitro experiments showed aNPCs efficiently inhibiting antigen-specific proliferation of cocultured PLP-reactive encephalitogenic T cells. Our preliminary data show that systemically-injected aNPCs may survive in vivo even for long periods of time and protect from chronic CNS inflammation owing to their capability to exert immunomodulatory functions within both canonical central (e.g. the CNS) as well as non-canonical peripheral (e.g., lymph nodes) site(s) of accumulation, where stem cell surviving factors are ectopically (re)expressed in response to inflammation.",

Recent studies have demonstrated that MSCs modulate immune responses supporting their utilization for the treatment of autoimmunity. Thus, we sought verifying whether MSC can cure mice affected by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis induced with the peptide 139-151 of the proteolipid protein (PLP), a myelin antigen capable of inducing a potent pathogenic T and B cells response. MSC treated mice showed a significantly milder disease and fewer relapses compared to controls. In vivo PLP specific antibodies titres and antigen-specific T cell response were significantly lower in MSCs treated mice. The adoptive transfer of encephalitogenic PLP sensitized, preconditioned with MSC, induced a milder disease compared to controls. MSC treated encephalitogenic cells showed decreased production of IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 and did not proliferate upon antigen recall thus were considered anergic. Upon i.v. injection, Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) labeled MSCs were detected inside lymph nodes early upon injection and inside the inflamed CNS at later stage. MSC injection resulted in a decreased number of inflammatory infiltrates, reduced demyelination and apoptotic neural cells and, as consequence, sparing of axons and oligodendrocytes. In contrast, no evidence of GFP labeled neural cells were detected, thus not supporting the hypothesis of trans-differentiation. Overall, we propose that MSC may have a dual function that may be effective for the treatment of MS, an autoimmune disease of the CNS where degeneration of neural cells follows inflammation. Bone marrow (BM) derived mesenchymal stromal stem cells (MSCs) can differentiate under certain circumstances into cells from various tissues. The aim of our study was to investigate the ability of BM-MSCs to migrate into CNS inflamed tissue and differentiate into cells of the neural-glial lineage, in the chronic-EAE model, and to evaluate whether these cells can exert a beneficial clinical effect.",

In this study we analyzed whole blood gene expression profiles of 29 patients with relapsing remitting (RR) MS and 25 age and sex matched healthy controls. Comparative analysis identified a stereotyped gene expression program that appears to reflect a virus response program, in the peripheral blood cells of patients with RRMS. Subsequent analysis revealed that the virus response program was characteristic of not all, but approximately half of the RRMS patients. Thus, the transcriptional signature of the peripheral blood cells defines a subpopulation of RRMS patients who exhibit evidence for a link between viruses and MS. The mechanisms responsible for the localization of lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) are currently unknown. To investigate this, we performed HLA-DR and HLA-DQ typing and examined T-cell reactivity to myelin proteins in 121 patients with MS not on immunomodulatory therapy, 71 healthy subjects and 47 patients with other diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). We found that 47.0% of MS patients with brainstem or cerebellar lesions, as determined by clinical assessment and/or magnetic resonance imaging, had increased circulating T-cell reactivity to an immunodominant region of myelin proteolipid protein ), compared to 10.0% of MS patients without brainstem or cerebellar lesions, 11.3% of healthy subjects and 19.1% of patients with other CNS diseases (p < 0.0006). We also found that 78.6% of MS patients with brainstem or cerebellar lesions carried HLA-DR4, DR7 or DR13 alleles, whereas only 28.9% of patients without brainstem or cerebellar lesions carried these alleles (p = 0.00000003). Furthermore, 60.9% of MS patients carrying HLA-DR4, DR7 or DR13 alleles had increased T-cell reactivity to PLP 184-209 , compared to 12.2% of MS patients not carrying these HLA alleles (p = 0.0001). Interestingly, H-2 k mice immunized with PLP 184-209 also develop inflammatory demyelinating lesions predominantly in the brainstem and cerebellum. Our results indicate that T-cell reactivity to PLP 184-209 drives the development of brainstem and cerebellar lesions in MS. In patients carrying HLA-DR4, DR7 or DR13 alleles, therapy with altered peptide ligands based on PLP 184-209 might prevent the development of brainstem and cerebellar lesions.",

Our aim was to model the gene network that controls the T-cell activation-differentiation-suppression process, which is critical for the development of MS, and to assess its functional properties in health and autoimmunity. Methods: We modelled a network with 20 critical immune system genes using scientific text mining and experimental data from 52 healthy controls and 52 patients with MS obtained by real-time PCR by using a Bayesian approach. We compared the functional differences in the network in health and autoimmunity using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for each pair of nodes. Results: We found a network with 31 links (gene-interactions), 18 already known (expected) and 13 non previously described. We validated 7 out of 9 links: 4 out of 5 expected and 3 out 4 new ones. We found significant differences between the control and MS network, mainly in the regulatory (TGFB1, IL10, JAG1) and proinflammatory pathways (IL-12). In addition we identified the effect of interferon beta therapy in the network, mainly in the interactions between ITGA4-TGFB1 and JAG1-TNF, TGFB1-GATA3, IL10-CD28, TGFB1-ITGB7, ITGA4-ITGB7 and IL10-ITGA4. Conclusion: Our results indicate that assessing the properties of the immune gene network using a system biology approach reveals significant changes in autoimmunity and provides insights in the effect of immunomodulatory therapy. Objective: To characterize T-cell infiltrates and in vivo expanded clonotypes derived from MS lesions. Background: Oligoclonally expanded T-lymphocytes perpetuate inflammatory response against CNS myelin antigens. This study addresses their representation in the MS lesions at various stages of development, and their antigen specificity. Methods: Brain and spinal cord tissue was obtained six hours post mortem from a female patient with aggressive relapsing remitting (RR) MS. Lesions were characterized based on the longitudinal CNS MRI, the last one 4 days prior to death, and histopathological and immunohistochemistry studies. Viable cells from six lesions and normal appearing white matter (NAWM) were expanded in vitro. To study in vivo expanded clonotypes and their TCRVb usage in the infiltrates from the lesions and NAWM, we RT-PCRamplified TCR genes and performed single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) pattern analysis. Results: Antigen specificity of MS-lesion derived T-cells was tested against a panel of immunodominant myelin-derived peptides. The highest proliferative response was detected against PLP 190-209 in acute pontine, chronic periventricular and thoracic spine lesions. Cells derived from acute lesion exhibited proliferative response against six myelin peptides, four of which were recognized in chronic thoracic, and three in chronic periventricular lesion. Single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) pattern analysis identified limited number of TCRVB chains expressed correlating to the in vivo expanded clonotypes. It revealed distinct patterns of TCR VB family chains in each MS lesion and NAWM. However, TCRVB4, VB5.1, VB8, and VB13.1 were present in all lesions. Antigen specificity of the clones corresponding to the in vivo expanded clonotypes is presently characterized using synthetic combinatorial peptide libraries. Relevance: This is the first study to characterize post-mortem derived T-cell infiltrates from MS lesions at various stages of development.",

The mechanism underlying BPHS is unknown but requires a 2-3 day latency and lasts \u223c 30 days. This suggests that the induction phase is associated with the storage of preformed vasoactive factors that are then released during the effector phase. Weibel-Palade bodies (WPB) within endothelial cells (EC) are secretory granules known to release preformed chemokines, adhesion molecules and von Willebrand Factor (Vwf) following exposure to histamine. Mice with a disrupted Vwf allele (VwfKO) have EC that are deficient in WPB and were used to evaluate the role of this pathway in BPHS and susceptibility to EAE. No significant differences in susceptibility to BPHS between wild-type and VwfKO mice were detected at three days; however, in VwfKO mice sensitivity persisted longer and the LD 50 -histamine was lower at later time points. Correspondingly, the onset of EAE was earlier, disease more severe and blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability significantly increased in VwfKO mice compared to wild-type mice. Increased BBB permeability in VwfKO mice was not due to increased encephalitogenic T-cell activity since BBB permeability was significantly greater in PTX-treated VwfKO mice compared to mice receiving encephalitogen-complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) + PTX, CFA + PTX or CFA. Taken together, these data indicate that WPB normally repress BPHS and adjuvant-induced alterations in BBB function associated with actively induced EAE.",

Liversidge a a Department of Ophthalmology, b Department of Radiology, University of Aberdeen, Scotland, UK Neural inflammation is caused by lymphocyte and monocyte infiltration across the tight junctions of blood-brain barrier, but the mechanisms involved in the adhesion and transendothelial migration of different leukocyte subsets are unclear. Using scanning laser ophthalmoscopy we have investigated the trafficking of monocytes and compared this with Th1 and Th2 cell trafficking at the blood-retina barrier (BRB) of the neuroretina, an extended organ of the brain. In normal circumstances, retinal vessels are subjected to high shear stresses and leukocytes do not roll. Activated T cells can migrate into the neuroretina in the absence of rolling and adhesion molecule LFA-1 is critical for the transendothelial migration. In inflamed retina there is a reduced shear stress in both arterioles and venules at the BRB but leukocytes only roll in the venules. Na\u00efve T cells and monocytes roll at similar levels, however primed/activated T cells roll in a higher efficiency. Different adhesion molecules are responsible for the rolling of different leukocyte subsets. In vivo conditioned monocytes roll faster than primed/activated T cells, and this fast rolling appears to be L-selectin dependent. PSGL-1 is also involved in the rolling of monocytes and Th1 but not Th2 cells, whereas CD44 is involved in the rolling of all activated leukocytes. For transendothelial migration, LFA-1 is crucial for Th1 and Th2 cell diapedesis but not monocytes. In conclusion, reduced shear stress is required for leukocyte to roll at the BRB. Different adhesion molecules are involved in the trafficking of different leukocyte subsets at the BRB. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) serves as a ligand for several receptors present on the surface of immune cells, including VLA-4. Because TSP-1 is expressed at high levels by endothelial cells, we investigated its role in the adhesion and traffic of inflammatory cells in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). Using in vitro techniques for the study of adhesion and migration under blood flow conditions we show that by virtue of its ability to bind VLA-4, TSP-1 is a potent substrate for the adhesion of Th1 cells and macrophages. This function appears to be critical in vivo, as TSP-1 null mice (C57BL/6 background) are completely resistant to developing MOG-induced EAE, in spite of their ability to generate normal immune responses against MOG [i.e., normal proliferation, antibody and cytokine (IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, IL-10, IL-17 and TGF-\u03b2), production upon rechallenge with MOG in vitro]. An in vivo role in trafficking for TSP-1 was also suggested by our findings using immunohistochemistry that TSP-1 is expressed constitutively at high levels by perimeningeal blood vessels in the CNS. This was further supported by histological and flow cytometric analyses performed at various intervals post-EAE induction, which showed virtually a complete absence of macrophages and other inflammatory cell infiltrates in the CNS of TSP-1 null mice. Thus our findings suggest that TSP-1 serves as an adhesion molecule, and that its expression by blood vessels is required for the traffic of inflammatory cells into the CNS parenchyma.",

The initial cues that orchestrate leukocyte entry to the injured CNS remain poorly-defined. We have used flow cytometry to investigate whether MyD88, an adaptor protein that transmits signals from Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and receptors for interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-18, regulates leukocyte infiltration to the stabinjured entorhinal cortex (EC) and to sites of axonal degeneration in the denervated hippocampus. We have previously established the kinetics of leukocyte entry to the denervated hippocampus. We now show that significant leukocyte entry occurs within 3 h of stab injury to the EC. Whereas T cells showed small, gradual increases over 5 days, macrophage infiltration was pronounced and peaked within 12-24 h. Infiltration coincided with increased mRNA for matrix-metalloproteinase-12 and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM)-12, but not interferon-\u03b3 or IL-17. MyD88-deficiency reduced macrophage infiltration to the stab-injured EC and the denervated hippocampus by more than 75% at 5 days postinjury. MyD88-deficiency abrogated T cell infiltration to the denervated hippocampus at this time, and reduced T cell entry to the stab-injured EC by 50%. MyD88-deficiency strongly reduced stab-injury induced transcripts for TNF\u03b1 and CCL2, which were increased several hundred fold at time of peak expression in wildtype mice (3 h) . Stab injury-induced leukocyte recruitment and gene expression were unaffected by TLR2 or TLR4 deficiency. These data show that MyD88-dependent signaling is important for proinflammatory gene expression and leukocyte recruitment after CNS injury. The chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) is thought to play an important role in the induction of autoimmune disease in the central nervous system (CNS) by attracting immune effector cells from the periphery into the brain.",

Moreover, we find that mixed chimeras with BM from RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 \u00d7 CCR2 \u2212/\u2212 mice are highly susceptible to disease, suggesting that CCR2 expression on T and B lymphocytes is not required for EAE development.

When HEK293 cells were transfected with wildtype CCR2 and stimulated with the CCR2 ligand, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, a rapid and transient increase in intracellular calcium concentration was observed. This calcium response was completely abolished by cotransfection of HEK293 cells with CCR2Y152F and wildtype CCR2. Transduction of adult hematopoietic stem cells with CCR2Y152F and subsequent generation of BM chimeric mice will be used to determine the contribution of CCR2 on myeloid cells to the inflammatory response in EAE.",

To investigate the role of IFN\u03b3 in CNS, we used intrathecal injection of a replication-defective adenovirus encoding murine IFN\u03b3 to IFN\u03b3-deficient SJL/J mice (GKO). This resulted in stable, long-lived expression of ELISA-detectable IFN\u03b3 in cerebrospinal fluid. IFN\u03b3 induced expression in the CNS of the chemokines CXCL10 and CCL5, to levels comparable to those seen during EAE. Other chemokines (CXCL2, CCL2, CCL3) were not induced. Mice lacking the IFN\u03b3 receptor showed no response, and a control viral vector did not induce chemokine expression. Chemokine expression was predominantly localized to meningeal and ependymal cells, and was also seen in astrocytes and microglia. IFN\u03b3-induced chemokine expression did not lead to inflammation. However, when pertussis toxin was given intraperitoneally to mice infected with the IFN\u03b3 vector, there was a dramatic increase in the number of T lymphocytes detected in the CNS by flow cytometry. This increase in blood-derived immune cells in the CNS did not occur with pertussis toxin alone, and did not manifest as histologically detectable inflammatory pathology. These results show that IFN\u03b3 induces a characteristic glial chemokine response that by itself is insufficient to promote inflammation, but that CNS chemoattractant signals can synergize with a peripheral infectious stimulus to drive T cell entry into the CNS.",

Perforin mediated cytolysis controls virus replication in macrophages/microglia and astrocytes, implicating TcR-class I interactions. By contrast, IFN-gamma controls virus replication in oligodendroglia, suggesting an inherent resistance to cytolysis. Despite these effector functions and T cell retention, virus persists in glia resulting in ongoing demyelination. To investigate the molecular basis of glia-T cell interactions in vivo, microglia, astrocytes and oligodendroglia were isolated from infected mice and analyzed for MHC expression and mRNA encoding antigen processing molecules. Maximal surface class I expression was delayed in astrocytes and oligodendroglia compared to microglia. Enhanced class I expression was consistent with earlier transcription of genes associated with the antigenprocessing machinery, specifically TAP1 and LMP2, in microglia compared to oligodendroglia. Furthermore, the biphasic transcription profile observed in microglia contrasted with the sharp expression peak in oligodendroglia, coinciding with maximal T cell effector function. Oligodendroglia were also distinct from microglia by their strong upregulation of the CD8 T cell inhibitory ligand PDL-1, substantiating strict control of T cell effector function. Contrasting class I expression, class II upregulation was extensive on microglia, but very limited on oligodendroglia and astrocytes. In summary, microglia have enhanced and earlier potential to present antigen compared to oligodendroglia and astrocytes, due to distinct responses to Type I-and Type II-IFN. Nevertheless, prolonged antigen presentation capacity implicated by sustained MHC expression in all glial cell types may be muted by differential expression of modulatory molecules.",

Published data indicate that T cells can mediate neuronal damage in an MHC/antigen-restricted as well as an MHC-unrestricted manner, while sparing astrocytes. In contrast, glia-directed neuro-cytotoxicity has been shown to occur in vitro by innate immune-cells such as \u03b3/\u03b4 T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Here, we sought to determine if NK cells could damage human neurons. To do so, we utilized CD56 + NK cells from IL-2-activated, normal adult blood, and primary human neuron-glia cultures derived from fetal brain tissue. Interestingly, we found that although co-incubation of NK cells with neuron-glia cultures resulted in detachment of neurons, the neuron viability as determined by propidium iodide exclusion was normal at all time points examined. In contrast, the underlying astrocytes, which constitute up to 10% of these cultures, were very efficiently killed by the NK cells. Time-lapse video microscopy indicated that NK cells began targeting the glial cells within minutes after co-incubation, whereas neurons were largely ignored. After 24 h, the remaining neurons were found to clump on the few surviving glial cells as determined by confocal microscopy. This data is consistent with a model of indirect neuronal injury mediated by innate immune cells in which neuron loss reflects primary loss of glial, trophic, or substrate support.",

MR1restricted NKT cells express the invariant V\u03b119-J\u03b133 T cell receptor (V\u03b119 + NKT). However, their function in immunity is unknown. In humans, V\u03b17.2-J\u03b133 NKT cells (homologous to V\u03b119 + NKT cells) were detected in multiple sclerosis (MS) inflammatory CNS lesions. Therefore, we determined the role of V\u03b119-J\u03b133 NKT cells in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a T-cell mediated autoimmune demyelinating disease of the CNS and model of MS. In contrast to humans, mice have extremely low numbers of V\u03b119 NKT cells. Therefore we used V\u03b119 TCR Tg mice crossed to CD1 deficient (CD1KO) mice which lack V\u03b114 NKT cells. We observed that over-expression of V\u03b119 NKT cells protects mice from EAE, and is associated with a decrease of Th1 cytokines but an increase in IL-10. In addition, adoptive transfer of V\u03b119 NKT cells to wt EAE mice could also inhibit clinical disease. In contrast, mice deficient in V\u03b119 NKT cells (MR1KO) exhibited exacerbated EAE. Coculture of V\u03b119 NKT cells with B cells demonstrated that B cells are induced to produce IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine known to inhibit EAE. IL-10 production from B cells was ICOS-dependent but MR1 independent. This study demonstrates that V\u03b119 NKT cells have a regulatory function in EAE and therefore may be attractive therapeutic targets for the therapy of MS and other autoimmune diseases. Activation of V\u03b119 NKT cells by novel glycolipids may allow for disease-specific therapy.",

We show that T-cell-derived cytokines (IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4) can induce microglia to become neuroprotective and to induce cell renewal. In contrast, aggregated \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) induces microglia to become cytotoxic and block both neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis of adult rodent neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs) In addition, high levels but not low levels of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3, a cytokine associated with inflammatory autoimmune diseases, confer on rodent microglia a phenotype that impedes oligodendrogenesis from NPCs. IL-4, reversed the impediment, attenuated TNF-\u03b1 production, and overcame blockage of insulin like growth factor (IGF)-I production.. In rodents with acute or chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, injection of IL-4-activated microglia into the cerebral spinal fluid resulted in improved clinical symptoms and increased oligodendrogenesis from the endogenous stem cell pool in the spinal cord, and induced neurogenesis in dentate gyrus spatially associated with microglia expressing MHC-II and IGF-I. Using double-transgenic mice expressing mutant human genes encoding presenilin-1 and amyloid precursor protein (a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease), we show that modulation of microglia into dendritic-like cells, achieved by a T cell-based vaccination with copolymer-1, resulted in reduction of cognitive decline, elimination of plaque formation, and induction of neuronal survival and neurogenesis.

We addressed whether or not proinflammatory cytokines could influence anti-A\u03b2 antibody-mediated phagocytosis of fA\u03b2 by microglia. Using aggregated A\u03b2 and fluorescent-labeled lysosomal probes, we examined phagocytosis of fibrillar A\u03b2 (fA\u03b2) and lysosomal pathway in mouse primary cultured microglial cells and murine Ra2 microglial cell line in the presence or in the absence of anti-A\u03b2 antibodies and proinflammatory cytokines. Anti-A\u03b2 antibodies drastically enhanced fA\u03b2 phagocytosis, which anti-CD16/CD32 antibody blocked by 70%. Proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukine-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) decreased A\u03b2 uptake as well as lyososomal vesicle formation. Proinflammatory cytokines did not inhibit A\u03b2 uptake induced by anti-A\u03b2 antibody. However, anti-A\u03b2 antibody treatment in the presence of proinflammatory cytokines caused microglial cell damages characterized by large cytoplasmic vacuoles. Our results show that A\u03b2-specific antibodies release the proinflammatory cytokine-induced suppression of A\u03b2 phagocytosis by microglial cells, but that A\u03b2 phagocytosis under proinflammatory condition leads to microglial dysfunction. These findings support A\u03b2 vaccination-based therapy combined with anti-inflammatory therapy for clearing A\u03b2 deposits in the AD brain.",

The mechanism underlying its neuroprotective activities, however, remains obscure. Many studies have focused on the role of T cells induced by GA administration, and particularly on the GA-induced Th2 shift in the profile of the induced T cell response. Since GA can induce rapid neuroprotection following brain trauma or glutamate-intoxication of retinal ganglion cells on a time scale that is insufficient for a T cell mediated response, we hypothesized that GA-induced neuroprotection might be T cell-independent and that a direct effect of GA on neurons might exist. To address this possibility, we treated primary human neurons with staurosporine in the presence or absence of GA. We found that GA significantly increased neuronal survival by up to 70%. This direct neuroprotective effect of GA is associated with its internalization into primary neuronal cells and increase expression of BDNF and activation of PKC\u03b1. Moreover, GA enters mononuclear phagocytes via induction of the RhoA pathway and causes an alteration of actin organization, which increases the trans-migratory abilities of monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs) through the blood brain barrier (BBB). DCs loaded with GA (DC vaccination) attenuate degeneration of injured optic nerve fibers as observed in our in vivo optic nerve crush injury model. This novel mechanism of GA-mediated neuroprotection may lead to development of new therapeutic regimens for various neurodegenerative as well as autoimmune diseases.",

We found less neuronal death and axonal damage as shown by MAP2 staining and SMI-32 staining following nasal tolerization with MOG in wt animals compared to IL-10 \u2212/\u2212 mice. The cytokine profile of splenocytes from nasally-tolerized IL-10 \u2212/\u2212 mice revealed a reduction in IFN-\u03b3 compared to non tolerized littermates and was associated with increased TGF-beta production and elevation in the frequency of LAP + CD4 + T-cells. These results demonstrate the lack of neuroprotection observed in IL-10 \u2212/\u2212 mice vs. wt mice relates to the absence of IL-10 rather than a lack of tolerance. Flow cytometry analysis showed elevation in the frequency of CD4 + CD25 + T-cells following nasal treatment in wt but not in IL-10 \u2212/\u2212 mice. To further investigate the neuroprotective role of CD4 + CD25 + T-cells, we incubated mouse neuronal cultures with CD25-depleted CD4 + T cells. We found increased neuronal cell death following oxidative stress in depleted cultures. Moreover, incubation of mouse neuronal cultures with CD4 + CD25 + T cells together with anti-IL-10 antibody significantly reduced the neuroprotective effect of CD4 + CD25 + T cells.

Pertwee 5 and Takashi Yamamura 2 Scientific evidence, initially demonstrated in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) models, now supports previously anecdotal evidence that cannabinoids may be beneficial in symptom control in multiple sclerosis. Natural cannabinoids such as tetrahydrocannabinol or synthetic cannabinoid (CB) receptor agonists can also induce immunosuppression of EAE. However, the underlying mechanisms and receptor location and subtype involved in cannabinoid-induced immunosuppression remains unclear. We demonstrate that amelioration of EAE by cannabinoids is associated with the suppression of antigen-induced T cell proliferation, pro-inflammatory Th1 (interferon gamma and tumour necrosis factor) cytokine production and inhibition of mononuclear cell infiltration of the central nervous system. Secondly, although leucocytes express CB 1 and notably CB 2 receptors, cannabinoid-mediated immunomodulation is largely, if not exclusively CB 1 receptor-dependent. This was shown using selective agonists and by the loss of cannabinoid activity in CB 1 -deficient animals. Thirdly, using conditional CB 1 knockout mice, we demonstrate that the major pathway of immunosuppression is not due to CB 1 receptor stimulation on T cells but more likely the indirect stimulation of CB 1 in brain centres. Only high doses of cannabinoids that induced sedative physiological effects and these may not be clinically achievable or relevant.

We show that fibrin signals through the Mac-1 (CD11b/ CD18) integrin receptor to activate microglia and regulate the progression and severity of inflammatory demyelination. Fibrinogen directly activates microglia resulting in dramatic cytoskeletal rearrangements and increased phagocytosis through the activation of Akt and Rho.

Regardless of whether LESCL or usual SCL, OSMS showed higher age at onset, lower frequency of secondary progression and higher frequency of negative Brain MRI, compared with CMS. Conclusions: The location of the lesions as well as the existence of LESCL is an important factor to decide a clinical feature of MS.",

Nishizawa a a Brain Research Institute, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan; b Utano National Hospital, Kyoto, Japan; c Ojiya Sakura Hospital, Ojiya, Japan Neuromyelitica optica (NMO)-IgG, whose target molecule is probably an aquaporin 4 (AQP4), is reported to be a specific marker for NMO and will be a good tool to distinguish NMO from multiple sclerosis (MS). Opticospinal form of MS (OSMS) which has been categorized in a subtype of MS are prevalent in Asian countries. The differences between OSMS and NMO have long been under discussion. To clarify this argument, we established the immunofluorescence detection system of AQP4 antibody (AQP4-Ab) using AQP4-transfected HEK 293 cells. We examined this antibody in the sera of OSMS with long spinal cord lesions (LCL) with or without cerebral lesions, OSMS without LCL, common form of MS (CMS) and healthy controls. AQP4 was positive in 62% of OSMS with LCL but was negative in any other forms of MS. Among OSMS with LCL, the AQP4-positive group was all women with severe visual disturbance, however other features such as patients' mean age, severity of limb and truncal disabilities, existence of cerebral lesions were not different from AQP4-negative OSMS with LCL. Our results of AQP4-Ab in OSMS with LCL were similar in frequency of NMO-IgG found in NMO patients, indicated that both groups are immunopathologically common and could be the same. Japanese patients with MS who fulfilled Poser's criteria. All MRI scans were analyzed according to the McDonald/Barkhof's MRI criteria. We pathologically studied periventricular lesions in 3 opticospinal MS (OSMS) and 2 conventional MS (CMS) cases, as well as studying the features of LESCL. Results: The frequency of patients who met the McDonald/ Barkhof's MRI criteria and had periventricular ovoid lesions were significantly higher in CMS than OSMS patients (65.4% vs. 23.7%, p < 0.0001, 88.6% vs. 55.2%, p = 0.0026), while the frequency of LESCL and periventricular rim-like lesions were significantly higher in OSMS than CMS (55.3% vs. 25.0%, p = 0.0016, 62.1% vs. 31.4%, p = 0.0057). Pathologically, OSMS showed periventricular rim-like demyelinating lesions while CMS had demyelinating lesions extending to the deep white matter. LESCL distributed diffusely from the cervical to the thoracic cord, mainly involving the central portion of cord. Gadolinium-enhancing lesions were seen most frequently in the upper thoracic cord. Conclusion: The frequency of Asian MS patients fulfilling McDonald/Barkhof's MRI criteria is low while LESCL and periventricular rim-like lesions are frequently seen in OSMS patients. Introduction: The McDonald criteria of MS which is largely based on the features of Caucasian patients states the spinal lesion should not be longer than 2 vertebral length and refers to a paper describing such lesions were found in 2-3% of patients. In proposed criteria for neuromyelitis optica by Wingerchuk et al., long cord lesion extending over 3 vertebral segments (LCL) on spinal T2-MRI is the most important characteristic. We report here the frequent brain involvement in Japanese MS patients with LCL (LCL-MS). Methods: Among patients examined after 2000, we analyzed the clinical, MRI and laboratory features of 77 consecutive patients with LCL-MS. The average of disease onset age was 36 (2.5-74) years, disease duration 11.4 (1-37) years and the female to male ratio 8 to 1. Results: Site of clinical manifestation at the first attack was in spinal cord 54%, optic nerve 25%, both 6.8%, brainstem/cerebellum 15% and cerebrum 0%. In 98.6% cases, LCL was confirmed within 2 years after the onset. Cerebral symptoms, which were not present at the first attack, later developed in 39%: frequently symptoms were severe and the MRI lesion size was large. Brainstem lesions developed in 60%, 15% of whom required respirator assist. Average of recurrence number was 17.1 (in spinal cord 11.4, optic nerve 4.4, cerebrum 2.0, and brainstem/ cerebellum 1.4). Cerebrospinal fluid IgG oligoclonal bands were mostly negative. Conclusions: We propose LCL-MS as a variant of MS, at least in Japanese population, in which LCL occurs at an early stage and many later develop severe brain lesions.",

The IL-6R consists of a 130 kDa ubiquitously expressed transducing element, and a cytokinespecific 80 kDa receptor subunit; the latter is expressed only on target cells (hepatocytes and subsets of leukocytes) and is released as sIL-6R. The IL-6/ sIL-6R complex can interact with membrane-bound gp130 and activate virtually all cells in the body, through a mechanism called transsignaling. We have previously shown that human myoblasts are able to produce IL-6; the specific object of this study was to verify whether IL-6/sIL-6R complex could drive human myoblasts to substain monocyte recruitment.

These T cells may then be used to investigate their yet unknown antigens. To distinguish autoaggressive from irrelevant T cells we focus on cytotoxic effector T cells that are in direct contact with their target cells and are clonally expanded as detected by immunohistochemistry and CDR3-spectratyping. Such cells were isolated by laser-microdissection from frozen biopsy specimens of polymyositis and inclusion body myositis lesions. We identified matching T cell receptor (TCR) \u03b1and \u03b2-pairs from several patients by a recently developed multiplex PCR protocol that allows concomitant amplification of both chains even from single T cells. From one patient we isolated 64 T cells which express an expanded V\u03b21 chain. In 23 of these cells we identified matching \u03b1-chains, 20 of which were identical. The dominance of this clone might indicate an antigen driven clonal expansion and points to its pathogenic relevance. We reconstructed this and several other paired TCR \u03b1and \u03b2-chains and expressed them functionally in T-hybridoma cells. Presently we are using these \"revived\" autoaggressive T cells to investigate their target antigens in vitro by cDNA expression and combinatorial synthetic peptide libraries. This protocol should be applicable not only to autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis, but also tumors and transplants. Background: To establish definite diagnoses of inflammatory myopathies including polymyositis (PM), dermatomyositis (DM) and inclusion body myositis (IBM), according to a recent criteria of the diagnoses, it is important to obtain muscle biopsy samples with inflammation. However, inflammatory change is often absent in the tissue obtained by conventional method of biopsy. Objective: To examine usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of skeletal muscles for determination of muscle biopsy sites to make diagnoses of inflammatory myopathies. Materials and methods: Method of MRI orientated muscle biopsy (MOMB) was established. Among 32 cases, excluding those already on steroids, which fulfilled criteria of Bohan and Peter for definite, probable or possible PM or DM and subjected to muscle MRI, 25 showed positive MRI change enabling us to apply MOMB, while 7 were negative on MRI. Muscle biopsy was performed in all these cases. For comparison, biopsies from 48 probable or definite cases of inflammatory myopathies, in which biopsy was performed at the belly of muscles before 2001. Histological change in the muscle biopsy was graded semi-quantitatively. Results: By applying MOMB, number of samples with inflammatory change has increased significantly. By conventional biopsy 75% of specimens showed inflammation, while all samples taken by MOMB did so. On the other hand, in cases without significant change on MRI, chance to observe inflammation from MRI negative case was 29%. Conclusion: MOMB significantly improved the diagnostic value of muscle biopsy for inflammatory myopathies. On the other hand, cases without significant change on muscle MRI emerged as a new issue. Method and patients: 30 CSF specimens from a group of healthy controls (HC) (5 samples) and MS patients (25 samples), classified as: Clinically Isolated Syndrome (7 samples), RRMS (7 samples), SPMS (5 samples) and PPMS (6 samples), were studied by means of the SELDI-tof.

Membrane Toll-like receptor 2 is thought to be a signaling receptor for intact PG, while three types of innate receptors recognize small PG motifs intracellularly, namely Nod1/ CARD4, Nod2/CARD15 and NALP3/cryopyrin. Dysregulated function of these molecules is involved in several types of inflammatory disorders, including Crohn's disease and Blau syndrome. We previously proposed that PG is a factor codetermining inflammatory activity in multiple sclerosis (MS), and present three lines of evidence in support. First, in postmortem brain of MS patients, antigen presenting cells (APC) contain PG, presumably resulting from infiltrating cells which acquired PG fragments at the mucosa, and these APC are immunocompetent as evidenced by expression of costimulatory molecules and cytokines. Second, in two non-human primate experimental autoimmune encepha-lomyelitis models (marmoset and rhesus monkey), the burden of PG in the inflamed brain correlated with severity of pathology and APC subtype in the brain. Leukocytes from monkeys and humans responded to PG challenge by production of IL-12p40. Third, encephalitis could be precipitated in mice by adding PG as the sole microbial compound to incomplete Freund adjuvant plus encephalitogenic peptide. This collective immunopathological and functional evidence from rodent and non-human primate models, as well as from human MS, supports the potential role of PG as a cofactor in MS and warrants further elucidation of receptors and pathways involved.",

The SAS procedure involves the display of a cDNA expression library from MS brain plaques on filamentous phage and subsequent selection on immunoglobulin G (IgG) present in serum or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). To enrich for selection of cDNA products binding to IgGs specifically associated with MS, alternative selection strategies on MS patient material and normal samples were performed. Using SAS on pooled CSF (n = 10) from relapsing-remitting (RR) MS patients, we identified a panel of 8 different antigens, which after detailed serological analysis with 161 MS CSF and control CSF, showed exclusive or preferential reactivity to MS patient CSF. Affinity selections on a second pool of CSF from 10 other RR-MS patients resulted in the identification of 3 additional candidate antigens. In addition, selections on two pools of sera from 10 RR-MS patients each resulted in the identification of 20 cDNA clones.

Highly activated memory CD8 T cells have been shown to clonally expand and persist in the CNS of MS patients for up to 5 years. Interleukin-15 (IL-15), a pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by macrophages and dendritic cells, is pivotal in the generation and maintenance of memory CD8 T cells. Higher amounts of IL-15 have been detected in MS patients' blood and cerebrospinal fluid. IL-15 bound to IL-15Ralpha on its own cell of origin, activates IL-15Rbeta/gamma bearing CD8 T cells. We sought to determine whether a local source of IL-15 can play a role in the acquisition of the memory phenotype by myelin specific CD8 T cells, and the persistence of such cells in the CNS of MS patients. Human monocytes/macrophages and astrocytes could provide the local source of IL-15/IL-15Ralpha since we observed that these cells express surface bound IL-15 up-regulated in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines. Myelin specific CD8 T cell lines cultured in the presence of IL-15 acquired a memory phenotype (CD45RO, CCR7-, CD62L-) that was not observed in the presence of IL-2. IL-15-cultured CD8 T cell lines contained high amounts of cytolytic enzymes, similar to activated NK cells.

We have recently demonstrated that NK cells biased for producing IL-5 (NK2 bias) are associated with remission state of MS. Here we report that upregulation of CD11c on NK cells would characterize a subgroup of MS in remission whose NK cells are lacking NK2 bias. When we compared this group (CD11c high ) with the other group of patients (CD11c low ) concerning NK cell expression of IL-5 and GATA-3, we found NK2 bias to be a selective character of CD11c low patients. In contrast, CD11c high group showed an obvious trend for a larger proportion of HLA-DR + cells within NK cells. Since NK cell stimulatory cytokine such as IL-15 was found to upregulate CD11c expression on NK cells in vitro, we postulate that inflammatory signals may play a role in inducing CD11c high NK cell phenotype. Although there was no clinical difference between CD11c high and CD11c low at blood sampling, CD11c high MS developed a clinical relapse significantly earlier than CD11c low during 120 day follow-up. These data point to an interpretation that CD11c high patients are at a higher risk for developing relapse, which is probably due to the loss of NK2 phenotype. Thus, CD11c on NK cells mirrors the disease activity of MS and may be used as a disease biomarker. Background: Plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) represent a subpopulation of DC which exerts divergent functions in innate and adoptive immune response. It is thought that different DC-subtypes may be critically involved in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Materials and methods: In our study we assessed by flow cytometry the phenotype of peripheral blood DCs from 35 clinically stable, untreated MS patients, 30 healthy controls and 9 patients with pneumonia used as nonspecific inflammatory conditions (NIC). For in vitro functional analyses DCs were isolated by magnetic sorting from leukapheresis material and cultured with trophic factors, unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanosine oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODN) or were used as regulators in co-culture system. Results: Ex vivo expression of CD86 and 4-1BBL was significantly lower on pDCs from MS patients than from controls and patients with NIC (22% vs. 47% vs. 41% and 12% vs. 35% vs. 32% respectively). In MS, pDCs stimulated with IL-3 and CD40L showed impaired maturation as demonstrated by significantly lower or delayed up-regulation of CD86, 4-1BBL, CD40 and CD83. Stimulation of pDCs by CpG-ODN resulted in a significantly lower IFNa secretion in MS than in controls. In MS but not in controls, pDCs failed to up-regulate proliferative responses and IFNg secretion of autologous PBMC in a co-culture system. Moreover depletion of pDCs in MS patients, but not in controls had no effect on generation of CD4 + Foxp3 + regulatory T cells. Conclusion: These findings suggest functional abnormalities of pDCs in MS patients, which might help to understand the mechanisms of immune dysregulation in this disease. In a search of reliable immunological parameters that can be used for assessment of disease activity, we examined paired blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples obtained from 34 non-treated stable patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), who had been admitted for confirmation of diagnosis or to assess disease status. The samples were analyzed for humoral immunity as well as cellular immunity using flow cytometric examinations of CD4 and CD8 cells to determine their expression of surface antigens, including CD11a, CD25, CD26, CD29, CD45RA, CCR4, and CXCR3. Thereafter, the patients were followed for at least 1 year at the outpatient clinic, where they underwent neurological examinations as well as gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, which were performed every 1 to 3 months until relapse became evident. Another group of 18 patients with noninflammatory neurological/psychiatric diseases served as controls. Of 27 RRMS patients who experienced a relapse within 1 year of the initial examinations, 7, 10, 6, and 4 showed relapse within 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. Those patients could be differentiated by the percentage of CD4 + CD25 + cells in the CSF. Patients with a greater than 3.6% ratio of CD4 + CD25 + cells in the CSF, which was 2 standard deviations above the mean of the controls, were more likely to relapse within 3 months. These findings suggest that enumeration of CD4 + CD25 + cells in the CSF can serve as a reliable measure of disease status in RRMS. However, the immunological relevance (regulatory or inflammatory) of these cells requires additional investigation.",

Methods: 19 untreated RRMS patients (mean age = 37.16) were recruited from the Montreal Neurological Hospital MS clinics. All patients had clinically definite MS based on McDonald criteria and were in clinical remission at the time blood was drawn. We recruited an independent set of 22 (mean age = 35) healthy controls, with no history of autoimmune disease. Lymphocytes were obtained using Ficoll-Paque\u2122 and na\u00efve CD4 T-cells were subsequently isolated by Macs\u00ae technology. Staining with PE-labeled anti-CD31 (indirect measure of homeostatic proliferation), PE-labeled anti-CD127 and PE-labeled anti-Bcl-2 (measures of homeostatic survival) and Facs\u2122 analysis were performed in order to ascertain the percent expression of CD31, CD127 and Bcl-2 respectively. Serum IL-7 levels (measure of homeostatic survival) were determined by ELISA. DNA was extracted from the remaining isolated cells and signal joint T cell receptor excision circles (sjTRECsa surrogate marker of thymic production) were quantified using real-time PCR. Results: RRMS patients showed a significant decrease in sjTREC levels (p = 0.01), CD31 expression (p = 0.02) and Bcl-2 expression (p = 0.02). Conclusions: Our observations confirm that there are indeed significant na\u00efve CD4 T cell homeostatic abnormalities in RRMS and suggest that nonthymic peripheral mechanisms are involved.",

Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) is one of the potential diseasecausing self antigens. We determined the serum antibody responses to native full-length MOG protein expressed on a human astroglioma cell line by a cell based assay. Antibodies, mostly IgG, were detected in serum of MS patients that specifically bound the extracelluar domain of MOG. These antibodies were directed against a conformational epitope that elicits a pathogenic antibody response in EAE. IgG but not IgM antibody titers to native MOG were significantly higher in the MS patient group compared to controls. One third of the MS patients, in particular primary progressive patients, had elevated anti-MOG antibody titers. These autoantibodies induced death of MOG-expressing target cells. Sera from MS patients with anti-MOG antibodies stained white matter myelin in rat brain and enhanced demyelination and axonal damage when transferred to EAE animals.

To investigate the role of Toll-like receptors (TLR) and MyD88, the common TLR adaptor molecule, in an animal model of human multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced by immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) in C57BL/6, TLR-or MyD88-deficient mice. MyD88 \u2212/\u2212 mice were EAE resistant. However, we expected TLR4 \u2212/\u2212 to have attenuated disease due to failure to signal the presence of TLR4binding pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMPs) in mycobacteria, and similarly for TLR9 \u2212/\u2212 mice due to failure to signal the presence of CpG DNA in mycobacteria. Instead, disease was paradoxically exacerbated in TLR4 \u2212/\u2212 and TLR9 \u2212/\u2212 mice. We also expected inhibited disease in TLR6 \u2212/\u2212 mice due to failure to signal the presence of mycobacterial lipopeptides, but loss of this TLR did not affect the disease severity. MyD88 \u2212/\u2212 mice failed to express IL-23 and IL-6, and serum and T cell IL-17 were absent. Then, we investigated how TLR signals can be regulatory. mDC IL-23 expression was higher and T cell and serum IL-17 levels were several-fold higher in TLR4 \u2212/ \u2212 than in WT mice. In TLR9 \u2212/\u2212 mice serum IL-17 levels were several-fold higher than in WT mice.

However, we have previously shown that neither Th1 nor Th2 gene-expression serves as a reliable marker for pathogenicity. Furthermore, the master-cytokine Interleukin (IL)-23 was shown to be absolutely critical for the induction of autoimmune disease as demonstrated in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) as well as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). It becomes increasingly evident that IL-23 supports the expansion of a distinct lineage of CD4 + cells that produce IL-17 (Th IL-17 cells) and play a major role in autoimmune inflammation. Using high density transcriptomics, we could identify an additional gene induced by IL-23. We discovered an IL-10 related cytokine whose expression profile is identical with that of the disease associated IL-17 but hasin contrast to IL-17so far never been described in the context of EAE. Its expression correlates exquisitely with that of IL17. Our findings point towards a major role of this illdescribed cytokine.

Joshi, Joe Carl, Xue-Feng Bai Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an experimental model of human disease multiple sclerosis (MS). Our previous studies have shown that CD24, which was originally described as a co-stimulatory molecule, is required for the pathogenesis of EAE. The development of EAE requires CD24 expression on both T cells and local cells of the CNS. In order to understand the role of CD24 expressed on local CNS cells during EAE development, we generated CD24 transgenic mice in which CD24 was expressed in the CNS under the control of the GFAP promotor (Astro CD24TG mice). In Astro CD24TG mice, CD24 was abundantly expressed in astrocytes. Upon immunization, Astro CD24TG mice developed a more progressive disease compared with their non-transgenic littermates (NTG), which was reflected by persistent EAE signs and large areas of demyelination and axonal damage in the spinal cords at later stages of EAE in Astro CD24TG mice. The enhanced EAE progression was associated with higher expression of cytokine genes including IFN\u03b3, IL-17, TNF\u03b1 and IL-10 but not IL-4 in the spinal cords of Astro CD24TG mice than that of NTG mice. Moreover, expression of a demyelination associated marker P8 was also increased in the spinal cords of Astro CD24TG mice compared with NTG mice. Finally, adoptively transferred 2D2 T cells, which are specific to MOG p35-55, expressed a more mature effector phenotype in the CNS of Astro CD24TG mice than in NTG mice. Thus, over-expression of CD24 in the CNS enhances EAE development via enhanced co-stimulation of encephalitogenic T cells. Since CD24 is drastically increased both on local cells and inflammatory cells in the CNS during EAE, our data have important implications for CD24 targeted therapy of MS. EAE is an animal model of multiple sclerosis and regulatory T cells play an important role in modulating EAE and in recovery. We have been studying TGF-\u03b2 dependent regulatory T cells that are associated with recovery from EAE and that can be induced following oral administration of antigens and more recently oral anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (Nature Medicine, in press). We have found that the surface expression of latency associated peptide of TGF-\u03b2 (LAP) marks a T cell with regulatory properties and that CD4 + LAP + T cells increase in the spleen and peripheral blood of animals during the EAE recovery phase. We have now initiated studies of CD8 + LAP + T cells. CD8 + CD25 \u2212 LAP + and CD8 + CD25 + LAP + cells from spleens and lymph nodes of SJL mice isolated by high speed cell sorting were anergic when they were stimulated with anti-CD3 in the presence of APC in vitro. Furthermore, these two populations suppress the proliferation of responder T (CD4 + CD25 \u2212 LAP \u2212 or CD8 + CD25 \u2212 LAP \u2212 ) cells in vitro. We also found that CD8 + LAP + T cells produce more TGF-\u03b2 and significant higher amount of IFN\u03b3 compared with CD8 + LAP \u2212 T cells. Thus, in addition to CD4 + LAP + T cells, CD8 + LAP + T cells may play an important role in the regulation of EAE. They secrete increased amount of IFN\u03b3, which may play a role in EAE as it has been shown than IFN\u03b3 deficient animals have a worse form of EAE. The secretion of IFN\u03b3 may also suggest a role for CD8 + LAP + T cells as a regulatory T cell in allergy.",

It has become clear that L-glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter plays a role in peripheral tissues, including the immune system. Here we show that Lglutamate, a major excitatory amino acid in synaptic transmission in the nervous system, acts as an immunotransmitter at the immunological synapse. Dendritic cells (DCs)the most potent antigen-presenting cells contain a vesicular compartment competent for regulated glutamate exocytosis. They also express glutamate-specific vesicular VGLUT transporters conferring a glutamatergic phenotype on neurons and release glutamate through Ca 2+ -dependent exocytosis. Remarkably, thymocytes express a large repertoire of glutamate receptors (GluRs), mirroring that of neural cells. In particular, they express functional NMDA receptors (NMDARs), which contribute to the Ca 2+ signal leading to antigendependent apoptosis in the context of T-DC synapses, mimicking thymic negative selection. We have identified the prototypical post-synaptic PDZ domain protein PSD-95 as a new marker of the immunological synapse. PSD-95 is recruited in the T-DC contact zones where it colocalizes with NMDARs. T cell stimulation, even in the absence of glutamate, also results in the co-localisation of PSD-95 with the NMDAR in the contact zone, suggesting that T-cell receptor triggering is involved in the recruitment of functional NMDARs at the synapse. This work reveals a new aspect of immunological synapse functioning, in which, similar to central nervous synapses, DC-released glutamate elicits focal responses in T cells bearing GluRs. Glutamate should therefore be considered a synaptic transmitter, acting through fine-tuning of Ca 2+ mobilization, in both the nervous and immune systems. AM is a novel peptide highly expressed by cerebral endothelial cells. In vitro studies show the peptide to regulate key BBB features including transendothelial resistance and permeability. Furthermore, we have shown that AM is elevated during EAE when the BBB is dysfunctional and inflammatory lesions apparent. AM acts primarily through the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) in combination with either receptor-activity-modifying-protein (RAMP) 2 or 3. The main cellular target for AM during neuroinflammation is uncertain. We have therefore assessed receptor expression on T-cells plus component cells of the BBB.",

On the other hand, previous observations in patients with neurocysticercosis showed that the immune response differs among brain regions, thus suggesting the existence of immunological compartments in the nervous system. Whether immune compartments and neural modules share their location and function has not been addressed. To explore this possibility we studied the immunological response to lesions carried out within and outside neural modules located in the primary somatosensory cortex of adult mice. These modules are called barrels and they represent collections of mechanosensory receptors. We found that the neural tissue adjacent to lesions placed outside the barrel field showed an intense astrocytic response and MHCII, INF\u03b3, TNF\u03b1 immunoreactivity in macrophages and activated microglia. These cells also expressed IL4 and IL10. In contrast, lesions placed inside the barrel field displayed MHCII, IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 immunoreactive microglia and macrophages predominantly in the border of barrels right next to the lesion. There was an extremely reduced response in the barrel center, as it was in barrels close and far from the lesion site. These data support the idea that neural modules may also function as immunological compartments. Our observations open a new perspective for the study and understanding of the physiology and the pathology of the CNS.

CNSspecific T cells were also found to be important for spatial learning abilities and for brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression in the dentate gyrus. Environmental enrichment did not evoke enhanced neurogenesis in immune-deficient animals, whereas in wild-type animals it led to enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis coupled with recruitment of T cells and activation of microglia. The clinical implications of these findings were tested using a rat model of cerebral ischemic insult. We demonstrate that Tcell based immune activation following stroke induces a robust elevation of neurogenesis in the hippocampus as well as in the cerebral cortex.

We have lately demonstrated that peripheral immunity contributes to adult hippocampal neurogenesis and spatial learning/memory, and that this is mediated in part by T lymphocytes recognizing brain antigens such as myelin proteins. Here we investigated whether CNS specific T cells contribute to the maintenance of brain plasticity only at adulthood, or whether they are required at earlier stages as well. We examined hippocampal neurogenesis in wild-type mice and in transgenic mice that express a T-cell receptor that recognizes ovalbumin ('T OVA -transgenic' mice), and thus bear mainly T OVA cells and no autoimmune cells, at different ages. We found that impaired neurogenesis and learning abilities appeared already at 4 weeks of age. Interestingly, the difference between wild-type and T OVA -transgenic mice in terms of the number of newly formed neurons generated in the hippocampus was relatively small at infancy, increased at adulthood and decreased for older age. We also compared hippocampal gene expression in wild-type mice and T OVAtransgenic mice, using gene expression screening. We searched for hippocampal expressed genes, which were possibly controlled by immune cells. Although 'T OVA -transgenic' mice differ from their controls only in their peripheral T cell repertoire, significant differences in expression of several hippocampal genes were found. Among the differentially expressed genes we found some that were known to be involved in neurogenesis and axonal guidance. Further analysis of such genes will contribute to understanding how adult neurogenesis is controlled.",

Toluene mainly affects the central nervous system causing memory loss. Toluene may produce some of its effects by directly inhibiting Nmethyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor function in a subunit-selective manner. To investigate the possible involvement of T cells in toluene-induced expression of memory-related gene in mouse hippocampus, we exposed BALB/c and nude mice to toluene at a low dose (9 ppm), and to air control (0 ppm toluene) as well in nose-only exposure chamber for 30 min in 3 consecutive days followed by once a week for 4 weeks. Four hours after the last challenge, we collected the hippocampus and examined the mRNA expression of NMDA receptor, protein kinase and transcriptional factors, which are potentially involved in memory functions, and then chemokines by a quantitative real-time PCR method. Our data clearly demonstrates that NMDA receptor NR2A, Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent kinase, CaMKIV, and transcriptional factor cAMP responsive element-binding protein, CREB-1, CCL2 and CCL3 mRNA expressions increased in the hippocampus of BALB/c mice exposed to 9 ppm toluene compared to that of air control. After immunization with ovalbumin, BALB/c mice showed no difference of NR2A and CaMKIV mRNA expression between air control and toluene (9 ppm). There were no alterations observed in nude mice with or without immunization. These findings indicate that T cells may play a role in memory-related gene expression induced by toluene exposure in BALB/c mice.",

Recently it has been suggested that injury-induced inflammation contain important elements of autoimmunity, which may be protective or detrimental. In order to dissect this process genetically and to examine potential influence by the MHC locus, known to be of importance for regulation of autoimmune processes, a well-characterized weight-drop contusion model was performed in a panel of inbred strains with different susceptibility to neuroinflammation. Included strains were: ACI, DA, LEW and PVG, as well as the MHC congenic strains LEW.1AV1, LEW.1N, LEW.1W and PVG.1AV1. Striking differences in motor behavioral outcome across the strains were observed. Interestingly, the best outcome was demonstrated for the inflammation prone DA rat, whereas the PVG strain, resistant in most inflammatory models, displayed an intermediate response. The different LEW strains, the wild type and three strains congenic for different MHC haplotypes, displayed the same worst outcome. No MHC haplotypedependent effects were observed in a F2 intercross experiment (PVG \u00d7 PVG.1AV1), providing additional evidence for a dominant influence of non-MHC genes. We conclude that outcome following spinal cord injury is subject to considerable genetic heterogeneity. However, this genetic regulation does not seem to depend on the degree of susceptibility to autoimmune neuroinflammation or, in particular, the MHC complex. These results provide a base for future studies to position genetic variants regulating outcome following spinal cord injury.",

Here we present the influence of the autoimmune reaction on dopaminergic neurons damage induced by MPTP. C57Bl male mice, 2 (young) and 10 (aged) months old were injected with MPTP (40 mg/kg). One group of each age, 6 days before the injection, had induced autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) 35-55 in CFA administration. Mice receiving MOG revealed typical EAE with clinical signs of tail and hind limb paresis. In these mice, MPTP caused less dopaminergic system damage than in MPTP only injected mice. The dopamine level was higher by 10% and 30% and the number of preserved neurons by 16% and 21% in young and aged animals respectively, on the 7th day after MPTP administration. The microglial reaction was diminished and lymphocytic CD8 + infiltration significantly reduced. TGF and GDNF mRNA expressions were significantly higher in MOG receiving mice when compared to MPTP group. We observed also shift in T cells populations, from the preponderance of CD8 + in MPTP group to CD4 + in MOG group. We injected mice with CD4 + anti-MOG T cells a day after MPTP administration and we observed also less damage of the dopaminergic cells when compared to MPTP only injected mice. We showed that immune enhancement is protective in toxic damage of the central nervous system. CD4 + cells are possibly involved in the protective mechanism, but the induction of trophic factors by other factors is also the option. An association between the autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis and HHV-6A has been suggested. In vivo, HHV-6A has been detected in myelin producing cells, i.e. the main cells that are affected in MS. HHV-6A might incorporate host cell proteins into the viral particles during replication. When the virus is detected by the immune system, the incorporated proteins will be presented for the immune system. This could be one mechanism for induction of autoimmunity.",

Peripheral neuropathy is the most common neurological complication associated with HIV-1 infection, affecting over one-third of individuals with AIDS. Studies also have found a high prevalence of HIV sensory neuropathy in HIV-infected patients despite administration of highly active antiretroviral therapy. To study HIV-induced PNS disease, we established an SIV/macaque model in which over 90% of animals developed PNS changes closely resembling those seen in HIV-infected individuals, including inflammation of the dorsal root ganglia with abundant replication of SIV in macrophages and DRG neuronal loss, sural nerve inflammation, and reduction in epidermal nerve fiber density in distal extremities. This constitutes the first primate model of HIVinduced peripheral neuropathy. In this SIV model we examined the relationship between dorsal root ganglia (DRG) changes and sensory nerve function by measuring C-fiber conduction velocities in the sural nerves and epidermal nerve fiber density in the skin of SIV-infected macaques and uninfected control macaques. SIV-infected macaques had significantly lower sensory C-fiber conduction velocity (CV) in sural nerves than uninfected animals (p = 0.01). The extent of conduction velocity decline correlated strongly with extent of macrophage infiltration in the DRG (p = 0.006). Significant declines in density of epidermal nerve fibers also developed in SIV-infected macaques (p = 0.01) but were not strongly correlated with changes in the CV. These findings suggest that primary injury to the neuronal cell body in the DRG mediated by activated macrophages alters functional properties of sensory nerves in HIV-infected individuals.",

In the absence of FDCs disease susceptibility is reduced. How TSE agents reach lymphoid tissues and the nervous system following exposure is not known. Recent evidence suggests possible roles for dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, as disease-specific prion protein (PrP Sc ) has been found associated with each of these cell types following exposure to scrapie. The current study utilized two intravenous infection models of scrapie (ME7 and 139A agent strains) to determine if scrapie-infected mononuclear cells (MNCs), especially DCs and B cells, could deliver infection directly to the nervous system in the absence of FDCs and other lymphoid elements. Scrapie-infected MNCs, B cells and DCs efficiently transferred infection when transfused into wild-type recipients. Indeed, the disease incubation period following transfusion of scrapie-infected DCs was similar to that of the MNCs and B cells even though 10-20\u00d7 fewer cells were used. However, in the absence of FDCs in TNF-receptor-deficient mice, the ability of the scrapie-infected cells to transmit infection was greatly reduced. These results demonstrate that for both the ME7 and 139A strains of scrapie, efficient neuroinvasion from the periphery requires prior agent replication/ accumulation on FDCs. In the absence of this accumulation, DCs and other mononuclear cells capable of delivering the scrapie agent directly to the nervous system but via a substantially less efficient mechanism.",

Together with prominent microvascular haemorrhage, necrotic vasculitis, severe brain edema, and markedly increased abscess size, these alterations led to an increased morbidity of IL-10 0/0 mice. Nevertheless, the hyperinflammatory response of IL-10 0/0 mice did not improve bacterial elimination.

We investigated (1) whether these APC effects mediate T-cell immunomodulation, (2) whether GA-treated monocytes can adoptively transfer protection from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and (3) whether T-cell cross-reactivity between GA and myelin antigen is required for its therapeutic effect. Methods: (PL/JxSJL/J)F 1 mice were injected subcutaneously with 150 \u03bcg GA/d in PBS prior to or after EAE onset. T-cells were cultured with GA, intact MBP, MOGp35-55 or PLP139-151. Monocytes from GA-treated wild-type or RAG-1-deficient mice were co-cultured with naive T-cells from MBP Ac1-11 TCR transgenic (Tg), MOG35-55 TCR or OVA323-339 TCR Tg mice. GA-treated monocytes were injected into immunized C57BL/6 mice. Results: Daily GA administration without adjuvant prevented or reversed EAE. We did not observe T-cell cross-reactivity between GA and myelin antigens. GA treatment of wild-type and RAG-1-deficient mice, which lack mature T-cells, induced type-II APC, secreting less TNF-a, IL-12 and more IL-10. These APC directed Th2-differentiation of naive myelin-and OVAspecific T cells, induction of regulatory T cells (Treg) and protected recipient mice from EAE. Conclusions: Therapeutic benefit of GA in EAE does not require T-cell crossreactivity between GA and myelin antigen. GA-treatment exerts a direct effect on APC without the requirement of T-cells. GA-mediated APC immunomodulation drives Th2-polarization and Treg-induction independent of T-cell specificity and is sufficient to adoptively transfer EAE protection.",

We have examined whether ongoing disease in a non-human primate model of multiple sclerosis can be suppressed with a new human IgG1\u03ba mAb against human IL-12p40. Lesions developing in the brain white matter were visualized and characterized with standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. To reflect the treatment of MS patients, treatment with the mAb was initiated after active brain white matter lesions were detected in T 2 -weighted images. In placebo-treated control monkeys we observed the expected progressive increase of the total T 2 lesion volume and markedly increased T 2 relaxation times, an MRI marker of inflammation. In contrast, in monkeys treated with anti-IL-12p40 mAb changes of the total T 2 lesion volume and T 2 relaxation times were significantly suppressed. Moreover, the time interval to serious neurological deficit was delayed from 31 \u00b1 10 days to 64 \u00b1 20 days (odds ratio 0.312). These results in a disease model with high similarity to MS are important for ongoing and planned trials of therapies that target IL-12 and/or IL-23. Background: Interferon beta (IFN\u03b2) is the most commonly used immunomodulatory treatment for MS and is administered to patients as an exogenous recombinant protein. Microbial components can induce the production of endogenous IFN\u03b2 by antigen-presenting cells (APC) through stimulation of TLRs. Poly I:C is a mimic of double-strand RNA that stimulates APC through TLR3. Methods: Female SJL mice were immunized with proteolipid protein (PLP) peptide (PLP) 139-151 and treated with poly I:C or PBS injected intraperitoneally during the induction or the relapsing phase of disease. Clinical, pathological, and immunological parameters were assessed. Results: Treatment with poly I:C significantly suppressed clinical and pathological signs of EAE in both treatment protocols. Poly IC induced significantly increased production of the CC-chemokine CCL2 (MCP-1) by spleen cells cultured ex vivo in the presence of PLP 139-151 . The expression of IFN\u03b2 was significantly increased in the spleens of treated mice. Neutralization of either IFN\u03b2 or CCL2 in vivo by injection of neutralizing antibodies reversed disease suppression by poly I:C. In vitro neutralization studies in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells showed that the production of CCL2 was IFN\u03b2-dependent. Conclusions: Poly I:C treatment suppresses EAE by mechanisms that involve IFN\u03b2 and CCL2. The induction of endogenous IFN\u03b2 will be further assessed as a strategy for the treatment of MS.",

COX-1 is constitutively expressed in most tissues, whereas COX-2 is inducibly expressed at site of inflammation. Selective inhibitors of COX-2 have been developed and have been used as anti-inflammatory agents.

Celecoxib also suppressed the severity of EAE even after the initiation of clinical symptoms. Moreover, celecoxib inhibited EAE in COX-2 deficient mice, indicating that celecoxib inhibited EAE in a COX-2-independent manner. In celecoxib-treated mice, IFN-\u03b3 production from MOG-specific T cells was reduced and MOG-specific IgG1 was elevated compared to vehicle-treated mice, suggesting a Th2 bias of MOG reactive T cells in vivo.

For genetic modification of DC, we used a recently established method to generate DC from mouse ES cells in vitro (ES-DC). ES cells were sequentially transfected with an expression vector for TRAIL or PD-L1 and a MOG epitope presenting vector. Subsequently, doubletransfectant ES cell clones were induced to differentiate to ES-DC. In this study, we demonstrated that the severity of myelin basic protein (MBP)induced EAE was also reduced by ES-DC-TRAIL/MOG but not by ES-DC-PDL1/MOG. This preventive effect diminished, if CD4 + CD25 + T cells were depleted by the injection of anti-CD25 mAb into mice before treatment with ES-DC-TRAIL/MOG. In addition, the adoptive transfer of CD4 + CD25 + T cells from ES-DC-TRAIL/MOG-treated mice protected the recipient na\u00efve mice from MOG-or MBP-induced EAE. The number of Foxp3 + cells increased in the spinal cord of mice treated with ES-DC-TRAIL/MOG. These results suggest that prevention of EAE by treatment with ES-DC-TRAIL/MOG is mediated, at least in part, by MOG-reactive CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cells propagated by ES-DC-TRAIL/MOG. For the treatment of organ specific autoimmune diseases, genetically modified ES-DC presenting some tissue-specific self-antigen along with TRAIL would be effective even when multiple auto-antigens are recognized by autoreactive T cells by the mechanism of epitope spreading.",

In this study we explored the mechanism of ECDI-antigen (Ag)-coupled cell (Ag-SP) as a treatment of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Ag-SP tolerance has been demonstrated to induce unresponsiveness in autoreactive T cells by presentation of Ag on coupled splenocytes initiating a state of anergy. This tolerance is believed to result from a direct interaction between the host T cell with the fixed donor Agcoupled antigen presenting cell (APC), delivering an Ag specific signal through ligation of the host T cell receptor and peptide:MHC class II complex on the donor APC without costimulation. However, mouse spinal chord homogenate, whole protein, or peptides all function as efficient Ags to induce tolerance suggesting reprocessing of the donor Ag-SP and representation of the dominant epitopes by host APCs. To investigate the mechanism of Ag-SP tolerance we examined donor vs. host MHC class II restriction during Ag-SP tolerance induction. Our data using MHC knockout, allogeneic and/or syngeneic derived donor Ag-SP demonstrate that MHC restriction is not necessary for Ag-SP tolerance induction. It appears that the ECDI-Ag-SP are actively undergoing apoptosis allowing them to function as an Ag carrier to be reprocessed and represented by host APCs. This further supports the promising use of Ag-SP as an antigen specific therapy for autoimmune and other inflammatory disease. This work was supported by NIH grant NS-30871. Administration of the superagonistic monoclonal anti-CD28 antibody JJ316 is a highly effective treatment in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) but the underlying mechanism has remained elusive. Using adoptive transfer EAE in the Lewis rat as our model we could now show that JJ316 interferes with the migration of pathogenic T cells to the CNS and that this is responsible for its great potency in preventing the development and progression of EAE. The inhibitory effect is achieved within the secondary lymphoid organs through the antibody's unique ability to expand and activate FoxP3 + regulatory T cells. Importantly, the presence of regulatory T cells within the CNS is dispensable for the beneficial effect of JJ316, irrespective of whether the antibody is administered prophylactically or therapeutically in overt EAE. Still, regulatory T cells preferentially home to the CNS at later time points after disease initiation, suggesting a potentially important role in the resolution phase or in preventing relapses. As to the mechanism at work, we found that administration of JJ316 prevents the disruption of the blood-brain barrier, favours secretion of Th2 cytokines and abrogates IFN-\u03b3 production. The latter results in an impaired expression of CXCR-3, the major chemokine receptor of effector T cells, which presumably accounts for the antibody's ability to inhibit the migration of pathogenic T cells to the CNS. This represents the mechanistic basis of a novel therapeutic concept that, we believe, may be translated into clinical practice once humanized monoclonal antibodies with the same specificity become available.",

Parenteral anti-CD3 is efficacious in animal models of autoimmunity and in humans, and anti-CD3 is approved for transplant rejection and positive results have been reported in new onset type 1 diabetes. We investigated the effect of oral anti-CD3 in the animal model of multiple sclerosis, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). Methods: We orally administered anti-CD3 or isotype control antibody in doses ranging from 5 \u03bcg to 500 \u03bcg once per day for 5 consecutive days. Results: In the SJL model of PLP induced EAE, oral anti-CD3 suppressed EAE given prior to or at disease peak. Optimal dose was 5 \u03bcg; no effect was observed at 50 \u03bcg and 500 \u03bcg worsened the disease. The PLP-specific immune response showed decreased proliferation, reduced IL-2 secretion and increased IL-10, IL-4 and TGF-\u03b2. There was an increase in CD4 + CD25 \u2212 LAP + (TGF-\u03b2 latency associated peptide) T cells with enhanced in vitro regulatory activity that was reversed by anti-TGF-\u03b2 but not anti-IL-10 and that correlated with the dose which suppressed EAE. Adoptive transfer of mesenteric CD4 T cell but not LAP-depleted CD4 T cells suppressed EAE in a TGF-\u03b2 dependent fashion. Conclusions: Anti-CD3 antibody given orally is immunologically active at mucosal surfaces. Oral anti-CD3 induces CD4 + CD25 \u2212 LAP + regulatory T cells that function in a TGF-\u03b2 dependent fashion. These results identify a novel and physiologic mechanism to induce regulatory T cells that is clinically applicable to a variety of immune mediated disorders.",

We demonstrate here a novel immunomodulatory mechanism by an exogenous peptidebased therapy that incites an HLA Class I-restricted, cytotoxic, suppressor CD8 + T-cell response. We have shown previously that treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) with glatiramer acetate (GA, Copaxone\u00ae) induces differential upregulation of GA-reactive CD8 + Tcell responses. We now show that these GA-induced CD8 + T-cells are regulatory/suppressor in nature. Untreated patients show overall deficit in CD8 + T-cell-mediated suppression, compared to healthy subjects. GA therapy significantly enhances this suppressive ability, which is mediated by cell contact-dependent mechanisms. CD8 + T-cells from GA-treated patients and healthy subjects, but not those from untreated MS patients, exhibit potent, HLA Class I-restricted, GA-specific cytotoxicity. We further show that these GA-induced, cytotoxic CD8 + T-cells can directly kill CD4 + T-cells in a GA-specific manner. Killing is enhanced by preactivation of target CD4 + T-cells and depends on cross-presentation of GA through HLA-E. Thus, we demonstrate that GA therapy induces a suppressor/cytotoxic CD8 + T-cell response, which is capable of modulating in vivo immune responses during ongoing therapy. These studies not only explain several prior observations relating to the mechanism of this drug but also provide important insights into the natural immune interplay underlying this human immune-mediated disease.

In the assay, serum samples (100 \u03bcL) were pre-incubated with 25 \u03bcL of a mixture of purified foetal and adult-type AChR. AChRAb in 50 \u03bcL of the mixture were allowed to compete with three different AChR monoclonal antibodies (MAbs1-3) for binding sites on the AChR: MAb1 was coated onto ELISA plate wells whereas MAb2 and 3 were labelled with biotin and used in liquid phase. MAb-biotin binding was detected by addition of streptavidin peroxidase and substrate. The higher the concentration of AChRAb in the test serum, the greater the inhibition of MAbs binding to the AChR resulting in a reduction in final OD. AChRAb were detected by ELISA in 76/83 MG sera studied (91.6%), whilst 72/83 (86.7%) were positive for AChRAb by immunoprecipitation assay (IPA) based on AChR labelled with 125 I-\u03b1 bungarotoxin. There were 12/83 discrepant samples; 8 sera were positive by ELISA but negative by IPA (0.33-0.47 nmol/L toxin bound) and 4 sera were negative by ELISA whilst positive by IPA (0.56-2.91 nmol/L toxin bound). All 191 control samples which were negative for AChRAb by IPA, were also negative by ELISA. Overall, results with the AChRAb ELISA and IPA agree well (r = 0.85; n = 83; P < 0.001) and the new assay has good precision and handling characteristics making it suitable for routine use. Antibodies to acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) are present in around 85% of patients with typical generalized myasthenia gravis. A variable proportion of patients without AChR antibodies have antibodies to muscle specific kinase (MuSK). A series of experimental approaches has suggested that some of the remaining AChR antibody negative patients have low affinity antibodies to the AChR; these would not be detected by standard immunoprecipitation tests because solubilised AChR is present in monomeric form and at low concentrations (<1 pM). We, therefore, asked whether we could detect antibodies to AChRs by immunofluorescence of cells expressing high density clusters of AChRs. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK) were transfected with cDNAs for each of the AChR subunits encoding the adult AChR isoform, and co-transfected with GFP-rapsyn. Rapsyn is a cytoskeletal protein that helps to cluster AChRs at the neuromuscular junction. The cells were incubated with patient or control sera and IgG antibodies detected by Texas-red-anti-human IgG. Control sera did not bind appreciably to the AChR clusters. Four positive controls with high AChR antibodies (>1 nM) showed strong IgG binding to the clusters. Ten of ten sera with low AChR antibodies (0.3-1 nM) showed appreciable IgG binding to the clusters. Ten of 18 sera that had been repeatedly negative (<0.3 nM) by standard immunoprecipitation were positive for IgG binding to the clusters These results show that antibodies to AChRs are present in over half the patients previously thought to be AChR antibody negative, and that cell based immunofluorescence assays could prove useful in diagnostic testing. Myasthenia gravis (MG) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune MG (EAMG) are autoimmune disorders in which the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) is the major autoantigen. DNA microarray technology, supported by quantitative real time PCR, immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry, were used to identify new potential drug targets for MG to delineate genes involved in the pathogenesis of the disease.",

Kondo 2 Myasthenia gravis (MG) is characterized by the T cell-dependent production of anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies. The chemokine receptor CXCR5 regulates lymphocyte migration and is expressed specifically on a subset of CD4 + T cells named follicular helper T cells (TFH), the key modulators of antibody production by B cells. We studied the frequency of CXCR5-positive lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of MG patients before and after therapy Untreated MG patients showed a significantly higher frequency of CXCR5 + CD4 + T cells in the peripheral blood compared with the control group, while no significant difference in the percentages of CXCR5 + CD4 + T cells was observed between the patients of the hyperplasia group and those of the thymoma group. The CXCR5 + CD4 + T cell frequency correlated with the disease severity. The CXCR5 + CD4 + T cell frequency of MG patients positive for other autoantibodies together with anti-AChR antibodies was significantly higher than in those having only anti-AChR antibodies. After therapy, the CXCR5 + CD4 + T cell percentage decreased gradually to the control level with a significant inverse correlation between the CXCR5 + CD4 + T cell frequency and duration after the initiation of MG therapy. These results suggest that CXCR5 + CD4 + T cells play an important role in the disease activity of MG and that some MG patients have a systemic abnormality in T cell-dependent antibody production.",

EAN was induced in female Lewis rats by injecting synthetic peptide of bovine myelin P2 protein with CFA. EAN rats fed with vehicle only were used as control. Clinical signs were assessed daily using 8 gradescore system. Cauda equina (CE) were removed at 4, 10, 12, 14, 18, 21, and 24 days post-immunization (DPI).

Both groups developed EAN at 12 DPI simultaneously although atorvastatin-treated rats showed milder signs and earlier recovery. Mononuclear cell infiltration seen in the CE of atorvastatin-treated rats was also milder than that of control rats. RT-PCR revealed that IFN-gamma mRNA expression at 10 DPI and IL-10 mRNA expression at 12 DPI in atorvastatin-treated rats were decreased compared to the control rats. In EAE, atorvastatin causes shift from Th1 to Th2 cytokine balance resulting in suppression of the neurological deficit.

In this inflammatory response, Schwann cells are actively involved. Recently, toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) was identified as a receptor for double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that induces anti-viral and inflammatory responses in cells of the innate immune system. In this study, we investigated the expression of TLR3 and the TLR3-mediated signaling pathways in Schwann cells. TLR3 was constitutively expressed in the primary rat Schwann cells and iSC, an immortalized Schwann cell line. Stimulation with poly(I:C), a synthetic dsRNA, induced the expression of various inflammatory genes such as IP-10, RANTES, TNF-\u03b1, and iNOS in Schwann cells. Studies on the intracellular signal transduction pathways using iSC revealed that dsRNA induces the activation of NF-\u03baB, p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). The activation of NF-\u03baB, p38, JNK, and PKR is required for dsRNA-mediated iNOS gene expression. However, the activation of PI3 kinase and GSK-3\u03b2 inhibited iNOS gene induction, a process mediated by their inhibitory effects on NF-\u03baB and p38 activation. NO production induced by dsRNA caused neuronal cell death in cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Finally, the introduction of dsRNA into the rat sciatic nerve induced iNOS gene expression and peripheral nerve degeneration in vivo. Taken together, these data suggest that viral RNA may induce inflammatory Schwann cell activation and peripheral nerve damage in the PNS.",

Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS), characterized by a clinical triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia and areflexia and by the presence of the serum IgG anti-GQ1b antibody, is considered to be a variant of GBS. The purpose of this study is to investigate antibodies to GSCs in sera of patients with MFS. We investigated IgG antibodies to GSCs in sera of 12 consecutive MFS patients using ELISA. Test ganglioside antigens were GM1, GM2, GD1a, GD1b, GT1a, GT1b, GQ1b, and GSCs containing two of the above seven antigens. Seven (58%) of the 12 patients had IgG antibodies to GSCs containing GQ1b or GT1a, five of whom had IgG antibodies to GQ1b-GM1 complex (GQ1b/GM1), GT1a/GM1, GQ1b/GD1b, or GT1a/GD1b and two had antibodies to GQ1b/GD1a, GT1a/GD1a, or GQ1b/GT1b.

Some CIDP patients whom corticosteroids cannot sustain remission, require repeated treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG). Objective: To investigate the therapeutic efficacy of ciclosporin for CIDP patients who require repeated IVIG, and to evaluate basic information and target samples size for therapeutic trial with ciclosporin. Methods: Ciclosporin was tried for 14 CIDP patients whom corticosteroids could not sustain remission. An initial dose of ciclosporin was 3 mg/kg/day with plasma trough concentrations between 100 and 150 ng/ml. Frequency of symptomatic relapses and side effects of 11 patients treated with ciclosporin for 12 months were investigated. Results: Eight patients responded to ciclosporin and sustained remission over 12 months; 2 gradually prolonged remission interval after increase of ciclosporin dose; 1 showed no improvement and repeated IVIG were required. Except for 1 patient with renal function disturbance, there have been no serious side effects. The preliminary favorable findings for our patients treated with ciclosporin support target samples size (ciclosporin treatment and extended IVIG treatment groups, each 25 patient) for ciclosporin trial. Conclusions: Ciclosporin is effective therapeutic agent for long-term remission in patients with CIDP who do not show sustained improvement under corticosteroid therapy. Ciclosporin should be tried for patients with CIDP who require repeated IVIG. Randomized parallel group comparison multicenter collaborative research, attending hospitals throughout Japan, will start soon. The current study used trimethyltin-induced damage to examine the contribution of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily in hippocampal dentate granule cell (DG) death and to determine if differential expression of the TNF receptors and relationship to glia would characterize neuronal vulnerability. In the DG, TNF\u03b1, TNFR1, TNFR2 mRNA levels (QT-PCR of laser captured material) were elevated; microglia activated; astrocytes hypertrophic. In the protected CA pyramidal layer, TNF\u03b1, TNFR1, TNFR2, mRNA levels were elevated; astrocytic processes thickened, and reactive non-phagocytic microglia present. Microglia proliferation was 11, 20, and <1% in the DG, CA, and CA1, respectively. With injury, intracellular distribution of TNFR1 protein in the DG shifted from membrane to cytoplasmic/nuclear, cells expressed active caspase 3 and were in contact with activated microglia. In the CA, intracellular distribution of TNFR2 shifted and cells maintained close contact with GFAP + astrocytes. Neutralizing antibody to TNF\u03b1 was neuroprotective; mice null for both TNFR1 and 2 showed damage attenuation; mice null for either TNFR1 or R2 showed exacerbation. TNFR1/2 null mice showed a significant elevation in basal levels and less induction by TMT for TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1, and TGF\u03b21 as compared to wildtype. Basal MIP-1\u03b1 mRNA levels were elevated over wildtype; with similar induction. Higher basal levels and induction of TNF\u03b1 mRNA occurred in the TNFR1 \u2212/\u2212 and the elevation in both TNF\u03b1 and IL1\u03b1 in the TNFR2 \u2212/\u2212 mice occurred at the lower dose. These results suggest a sequence of events: proinflammatory cytokines, activation of death receptors, and microglia phenotype determining pattern of neuronal death. Objective: Our goal was to determine whether the EP1 prostanoid receptor contributed to the excitotoxic death of neurons. Methods: EP1 receptor antagonists (Ono 8711 and SC51089) were examined for neuroprotective effects against an excitotoxic exposure to nmethyl-d-aspartate (NMDA). This was tested in two preparations of primary neuronal cultures containing greater than 90% neurons (PN) or a mixture of neurons and glia. Results: Treatments of Ono 8711 (3, 10 or 30 nM), SC51089 (10 \u03bcM) or the COX-2 inhibitor NS398 (30 \u03bcM), increased the number of neurons that survived NMDA by a factor of three in PN cultures. In mixed cultures, no neuroprotection was seen with any concentration of Ono 8711, SC51089 or NS398. The percent of neurons that expressed EP1 was 65% in mixed cultures and 90% in PN cultures. NMDA induced a ten-fold increase in PGE2 in both culture preparations, although the net amount of PGE2 was about five-fold higher in the mixed cultures. Combined, these findings indicate that a lack of neuroprotection in mixed cultures by EP1 antagonists was not due to a lack of neuronal EP1 expression nor was it due to an inability to synthesize PGE2.",

Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), p38 and JNK, and MAPK kinases (MKKs), MKK3/6 and MKK4 were examined by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Protein carbonylation, nitrosylation and lipid peroxidation were assessed to evaluate antioxidative effects of TRX. RGCs were rescued by TRX, compared with saline, when evaluated by retrograde labelling analysis, 7 days after NMDA-injection. TRX, but not its mutant form, prevented NMDAinduced apoptosis in the retina, as measured by TUNEL. The induction of caspase-3 and caspase-9, but not caspase-8, by NMDA was significantly lower in TRX-treated eyes than in saline-treated eyes. NMDA-induced activation of p38 and JNK after 6 h, and of MKK3/6 and MKK4 after 3 h, was markedly suppressed in RGCs by TRX, but not by the mutant form. NMDA-induced increases in protein carbonylation, nitrosylation, and lipid peroxidation were also suppressed in TRX-treated eyes. TRX effectively attenuates NMDA-induced retinal cell damage, and suppression of oxidative stress and inhibition of apoptotic signalling pathways are involved in this cytoprotective effect.",

            "text": "Trail-induced death of adult human oligodendrocytes is mediated by JNK and mitochondrial activation Background: TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand) is a member of TNF family that induces death of mainly tumor cells. TRAIL is expressed on autoreactive T cells and induces death of adult human oligodendrocytes by ligation of TRAIL-receptor 1. Intracellular signaling involved in oligodendrocytes injury is still unknown. Methods: In our study we investigated involvement of JNK and mitochondrial pathway in death after TRAIL stimulation. JNK activation was assessed by using antibodies against phosphorylated JNK isoforms and analyzing c-jun phosphorylation by autoradiography. The role of JNK activation was estimated by using dominant negative construct of MKK4, kinase upstream of JNK. Changes in mitochondrial membrane permeability was assessed using ApoAlert Mitochondrial Membrane kit. Cell death was analyzed by FACS using Annexin-V and PI staining. Results: Our results shown that intracellular signaling involved in TRAILinduced death of oligodendrocytes is associated with strong, sustained activation of JNK isoform 3. After TRAIL stimulation was observed changes in mitochondrial membrane potential. JNK-3 activation occurred before mitochondrium activation. Dominant negative mutant of MKK4 inhibited TRAIL induced mitochondrial membrane disruption and oligodendrocytes injury. Conclusions: These results indicate that JNK and mitochondrial activation are critically involved in oligodendrocytes death induced by TRAIL and might have importance in protection immune-mediated oligodendrocytes demise. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induces apoptotic-like cell death of oligodendrocytes, the cell type targeted in MS. The ligation of TNF receptors induces several signal transduction pathways including caspase cascade and mitochondrial derived factors like apoptosis inducing factor (AIF). However, the precise mechanism involved in human oligodendrocyte (hOL) death, is unknown. OLs were prepared from human brain specimen. TNF-induced hOLs death, was detected by flow cytometry with annexinV-FITC and PI staining. AIF activity was assessed by hOLs DNA electrophoresis and its nuclei translocation with confocal microscopy. Anti-sense construct (asAIF) was used to prevent AIF activity. Caspase inhibitor, ZVAD.FMK, calpain inhibitor, ZLLY.FMK, serine proteases inhibitor, TPCK, and cathepsin inhibitors, ZFL and ca-074-Me, were used to assessed their involvement in OL death. TNF-induced death of hOLs is noncaspase dependent, as evidenced by: lack of generation of caspase-8, -1 and -3 active subunits; lack of cleavage of caspase-1 and -3 fluorogenic substrates; and lack of hOL death inhibition by ZVAD.FMK. Also calpain, serine proteases, and cathepsin inhibitors were inefficient in prevention of hOLs death. In contrary, TNF-induced hOLs death involved AIF as evidenced by characteristic for AIF-induced cell death large scale DNA fragmentation and AIF translocation to hOLs nuclei upon TNF exposure. Accordingly, TNF-induced hOLs death was prevented by inhibition of AIF with asAIF. In brain sections, within the edge of MS lesion, some oligodendrocytes defined by anti-MBP staining showed nuclei positive for AIF. These results indicate that TNF-induced death of hOLs depends on AIF, information of significance for the design strategies to protect hOLs during immune-mediated demyelination.",

We have previously shown that sublytic C5b-9 complexes, through posttranslational regulation of Bad, inhibit the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. In the present study we examined the possible involvement of the caspase-8 and Fas pathway in oligodendrocyte apoptosis and the role of C5b-9 in this process. In serum-free defined medium oligodendrocytes undergo apoptosis and differentiation concomitantly. Under this condition, we found that caspase-8 processing was increased in association with Bid cleavage and markedly reduced expression of c-FLIP L protein. The caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK inhibited cell death associated with differentiation in a dosedependent manner. Exposure to C5b-9 induced an inhibition of caspase-8 activation, Bid cleavage, and a significant increase in c-FLIP L expression. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 reversed these C5b-9 effects. C5b-9 also down-regulated the expression of FasL and the Fas induced apoptosis. These data suggest that C5b-9 through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling can rescue OLG from Fas-mediated apoptosis by regulating caspase-8 processing.",

In this study, we focused on the direct effects of interferon-gamma (IFNG) on purified rat oligodendroglial cultures at different developmental stages. Among the three stages tested, IFNG had direct cytotoxic effects on actively proliferating oligodendrocyte progenitors, but much less on immature oligodendrocytes and none on mature oligodendrocytes. This stage specific susceptibility of progenitors to IFNGinduced cytotoxicity consisted of two components, delay in the cell cycle transition from the G1 phase to the S phase and increased cell death at least partly mediated by apoptosis, suggesting that progression of the cell cycle was tightly linked to this toxic mechanism. As far as could be determined by examining induction of IRF1 mRNA in response to IFNG, there was no functional difference in the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathways between progenitors and mature oligodendrocytes. We found that partial inhibition of the ERK pathway, one of mitogen activated protein kinase pathways, by U0126 partially reversed the IFNG-induced cytotoxicity. In addition, ERK activity was quickly downregulated after differentiation of progenitors to immature oligodendrocytes. Therefore, we concluded that simultaneous activation of the STAT pathway by IFNG and the ERK pathway by trophic factors played a role in the stage specific IFNGinduced cytotoxicity in oligodendroglial progenitors. Activation of Akt attenuates apoptosis mediated through both the extrinsic death receptors and via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. To identify additional downstream targets of Akt, we screened the human protein database for Akt consensus sequences in proteins of unknown function. A highly conserved protein, SAMSN1, predicted to contain 373 amino acids and three Akt consensus phosphorylation sites was identified. The SAMSN1mRNA arises by alternative splicing of a 10 kb gene on chr.21q11 also encoding the recently described HACS1 protein. SAMSN1 mRNA was predominantly expressed in tissues of hematopoietic origin and was detected in mature B and T lymphocytes and macrophages but not in epithelial lines or primary fibroblasts. Co-expression of SAMSN1 with Akt lead to PI-3 kinase dependent, phosphorylation of SAMSN1 and its interaction with Akt. To explore the cellular localization and function of SAMSN1, wild type SAMSN1and mutants lacking either the Akt phosphorylation sites (Tri-A mutant), nuclear localization signals (\u0394-NLS), or SAM domain (\u0394-SAM) were expressed in 293 T cells. SAMSN1, as well as the Tri-A and \u0394-SAM mutants, but not the \u0394-NLS mutant, localized to the nucleus indicating that Akt phosphorylation did not regulate cell localization. Jurkat T cells transduced with a retroviral vector expressing WT SAMSN1 were significantly protected from Fas, but not staurosporin, mediated apoptosis and this protection required the putative Akt phosphorylation sites. Together, these data suggest that SAMSN1 as a novel Akt substrate localized to the nucleus of cells of hematopoietic origin that mediates protection from Fas mediated apoptosis.",

Despite a large body of experimental evidence, the fundamental mechanisms underlying IL-6-mediated neuroprotection are not understood until today. Our data clearly show that IL-6 is not a neuroprotective agent per se, but that IL-6 instead enhances the expression and function of neuronal adenosine A 1 receptor in vitro and in vivo. Accordingly, we provide evidence that IL-6 by enhancing neuronal adenosine A 1 receptor function (1) efficiently protects hippocampal neurons from hypoxia in acutely prepared brain slices; (2) facilitates neuronal survival in an excitotoxicity paradigm; and (3) protects animals from chemically induced convulsing seizures. It is moreover shown that IL-6-dependent neuroprotection is abolished when the function of neuronal adenosine A 1 receptors is blocked. Based on this data we suggested that IL-6 increases neuronal survival in vitro and in vivo by enhancing the function of neuronal adenosine A 1 receptors, the brains major protective system.",

Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) is a viral nucleic acid sentinel activated by dsRNA within intracellular vesicles. TLR3 signals through TRIF (TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN\u03b2) and TRAF6 to activate interferon regulatory factor 3 leading to the production of IFN\u03b2 (primary response), and to a delayed activation of NF-kB leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. To explore the spectrum of genes induced in human astrocytes by TLR3 we used a microarray approach and the dsRNA mimetic poly I:C (pIC) as ligand. One of the highly induced genes was viperin/cig5, a protein with known anti-viral activity. Viperin/cig5 expression was dependent on IRF3 and NF-kB signaling, and repetitive stimulation with poly(I:C) but not IL-1 further increased expression. To determine whether poly(I:C) induced an antiviral state in astrocytes, a pseudotyped HIV viral particle VSVg-env-HIV-1 was used. Poly(I:C) significantly abrogated HIV-1 replication whereas IL-1, which also potently activates astrocytes, did not. Viperin induction could also be substantially inhibited by neutralizing antibodies to IFNb, as could HIV-1 replication. To explore a role for viperin in IFNbmediated inhibition of HIV-1 we employed an RNAi approach. RNAi directed against viperin, but not a scrambled RNAi, significantly inhibited viperin expression, and also significantly reversed poly(I:C)-induced inhibition of HIV-1 replication. We conclude that viperin contributes to the antiviral state induced by TLR3 ligation in astrocytes, supporting a role for astrocytes as part of the innate immune response against infection in the CNS.",

Results: TREM2 stimulation increased phagocytic activity, but neither induced inflammatory mediators nor up-regulated surface markers were involved in antigen presentation. Furthermore, TREM2 knock down microglia showed impaired clearance of apoptotic neurons and increased gene transcription of TNFalpha, IL-1beta and NOS2. Over-expression of TREM2 in microglia resulted in increased phagocytosis of apoptotic neurons and decreased gene transcription of inflammatory mediators.

It has neuroprotective properties and can be detected within the central nervous system. We previously demonstrated that concentrations of activin A are elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with meningitis. As the sources of elevated activin A concentrations in CSF during meningitis have not yet been discovered, we examined whether microglial cells release activin A upon stimulation with bacterial Toll-likereceptor (TLR)-agonists. Methods: Primary mouse microglial cells were exposed to agonists of TLR2 [Pam3Cys (Tripalmitoyl-S-glyceryl-cysteine)], TLR4 [LPS (lipopolysaccharide)], and TLR9 [CpG (oligonucleotides containing unmethylated cytosinguanosin motifs)] for 24 h. Activin A concentrations in the cell culture supernatants were measured by ELISA [median (minimum / maximum)]. Results: While activin A concentrations in the cell culture supernatants were below the detection limit of the ELISA in the control group, they were significantly elevated after treatment with the different TLR-agonists: 279 pg/ ml (196/337) after 1\u03bcg/ml LPS (p < 0.0001), 117 pg/ml (0/167) after 1 \u03bcg/ml Pam3Cys (p = 0.007), and 77 pg/ml (0/185) after 10 \u03bcg/ml CpG (p =0.02). Discussion: Our results show for the first time that microglial cells release activin A upon activation by bacterial TLR-agonists. This finding provides further evidence for a role of activin A in the innate immune response and suggests that microglial cells are a source of elevated activin A concentrations observed in the CSF during bacterial meningitis. Our previous studies demonstrated that SOCS-3 plays an important role in the inhibition of LPS-induced CD40 gene expression. In this study, we describe that LPS is a strong inducer of SOCS-3 expression in macrophages and microglia, which occurs at the transcriptional level. An analysis of the SOCS-3 promoter indicates that AP-1 and two GAS elements are involved in LPS-induced SOCS-3 transcription in macrophages. LPS-induced SOCS-3 expression involves the endogenous production of IL-6, which contributes to SOCS-3 expression by STAT-3 activation. Blocking IL-6-induced STAT-3 activation by the inclusion of IL-6 neutralizing antibody reduces LPSinduced SOCS-3 gene expression. Furthermore, LPS induces activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which is also involved in LPS-induced SOCS-3 gene expression. These results indicate that LPS-induced MAPK activation and endogenous production of IL-6 that subsequently induces STAT-3 activation play critical roles in the regulation of SOCS-3. We propose that LPS-induced SOCS-3 expression results in a negative feedback loop to attenuate LPS and cytokine-induced immune and inflammatory responses in the CNS.",

To determine whether there are species-differences in the recruitment and microglial transformation of BM-derived cells into injured CNS, we analyzed the microglial reaction in radiation BM chimeric mice and rats subjected to classical forms of experimental manipulation, known to elicit predictable, strong microglial reactions with no or minimal involvement of monocytic macrophages. We found that a subpopulation of the reactive, bushy-type microglial cells in the dentate gyrus originated from transformed BM-derived cells after entorhinal cortex lesion in BM chimeric mice. This contrasted BM chimeric rats subjected to global cerebral ischemia, which displayed the characteristic microglial rod cell transformation and microglial hyperplasia in regio superior hippocampus, but in the absence of recruitment and microglial transformation of BM-derived cells. Our results provide evidence that reactive microglia in the rat originate from resident microglia, while having mixed BM-derived and resident origin in the mouse. The data emphasize that there are important species-differences in recruitment of blood-borne microglial precursors to the brain and that speciesdifferences may be an issue when considering using BM-derived cells for gene delivery to the CNS in human neurological disorders. Importantly, BM chimeric rats may provide valuable models to establish conditions for how to attract genetically manipulated BM-derived cells into human CNS.",

In particular, markers which could reliably discriminate microglia from other macrophages, have not been yet identified. In the present work, we used gene array analysis to compare the RNA profiles obtained from microglia versus bone-marrow derived macrophages (BMM). Microglial cells isolated from mixed glial cell cultures were driven toward a \"resting\" state by growing them for 4 days in the presence of a glial cell conditioned medium. In parallel experiments, BMM were generated by stimulating bone-marrow derived myeloid progenitors with M-CSF, for 4 days. After a control of RNA quality (BioAnalyzer 2100, Agilent), double amplification process was performed before cDNA synthesis. The expression of 20,000 genes was then assessed on a CodeLink plateform from Amersham and data were analyzed with Genespring software from Silicon Genetics. To validate our results, genes of interest were selected and their relative level of expression was evaluated by real-time RT-PCR. A number of immune-related genes were identified including genes coding for MHC class II molecules (up-regulated in macrophages), the IL-10 receptor (up-regulated in microglia,) or the erythropoietin receptor (up-regulated in microglia). However, we also identified genes that were not related to immune functions. In particular, several genes involved in lipid metabolism were found to be specifically expressed by microglia.",

This potent phagocytic capacity has hardly been analysed in the context of brain tumour where it could serve the purpose of removing dying but also living tumour cells, as described for macrophages. We herein report on quantitative studies, based on flow cytometry assays, and qualitative studies, using time-lapse video microscopy, that we conducted with primary cultures of microglia derived from three mouse strains and three different glioma cell lines. The phagocytic capacity of microglia was evaluated by determining their phagocytic rate (percent of microglia from a total population that phagocytosed tumour cells within a given time). Microglia from either BALB/c, C57BL/6 and VM/Dk strains all phagocytosed etoposide-treated, apoptotic glioma cells. The phagocytic rate varied between 30% and 70% according to the strain but not to the glioma cell line used. No significant uptake of living tumour cells was observed. Beside the known induction of microglial toxic activity, LPS and interferon-gamma stimulation increased the phagocytic rate, save for VM/Dk-derived microglia. As expected, amoeboid microglia present in the unstimulated population were the only phagocytes, whereas upon stimulation this activity was also observed for rod-shaped cells. Immune stimulation enhanced motility and exploratory behaviour. Stimulated microglia not only killed tumour cells but also phagocytosed dead cells present in their close vicinity. Altogether our data indicate that microglia can phagocytose apoptotic but not living tumour cells. Current work focus on the identification of receptors and ligands mediating microglia-glioma cell recognition. The pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative disorders is exacerbated by an imbalance between matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). We previously reported differential TIMP-1 expression in acute versus chronic astrocyte activation, and in brain tissue of patients with HIV-1-associated dementia (HAD). We now investigate possible mechanisms underlying chronic TIMP-1 downregulation in neuroinflammation. We used interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 as a model proinflammatory stimulus and measured mRNA stability in U87 astroglioma cells and transcriptional regulation in activated astrocytes. The half-life of TIMP-1 mRNA was quantified using real time PCR to determine the effects of IL-1\u03b2 stimulation on the stability of TIMP-1 transcripts. TIMP-1 promoter activation was measured using TIMP-1-luciferase reporter constructs in transfected astrocytes. Our results demonstrate that enhanced TIMP-1 mRNA stability may lead to increased TIMP-1 levels following acute activation. However, chronic downregulation of astrocyte-TIMP-1 is likely through promoter regulation and loss of mRNA stabilization. Furthermore, other proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, along with HIV-1, enhance the effects of IL-1\u03b2 on astrocyte-TIMP-1 promoter regulation. The minimum TIMP-1 promoter sequence demonstrated the strongest downregulation in promoter activity following activation of transfected astrocytes, suggesting the location of a silencer element. These data are important for unraveling the mechanisms underlying astrocyte responses during chronic inflammation and have broader implications in other inflammatory diseases that involve MMP/TIMP imbalance.",

While PPAR\u03b3 (the nuclear ligand-responsive transcription factor) is known as a mediator of pleiotropic anti-inflammatory pathways, its contribution to endothelial barrier function remains largely unknown. We tested effects of PPAR\u03b3 stimulation on monocyte migration across BBB in vitro models (primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells, HMVEC, plated on porous membranes). Application of tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and monocyte chemoattractive protein-1 (MCP-1), a relevant cytokine and chemokine known to increase during HIV-1 infection, augmented monocyte migration by 2.5-fold across BBB. Pretreatment of endothelial monolayers with rosiglitazone, a PPAR\u03b3 agonist, diminished by \u223c 5-fold the migration of HIV-1 infected monocytes across BBB compared with untreated controls. Similarly, HMVEC pre-treatment with TNF-\u03b1 increased adhesion of HIV-1 infected monocytes (3-fold) , and adhesion was reduced by 42% after simultaneous application of rosiglitazone and TNF-\u03b1. Since our previous work indicated that monocyte-HMVEC interactions result in activation of Rho, small GTPase, we tested the idea that increased monocyte migration could be mediated by TNF-\u03b1 induced Rho activation, and PPAR\u03b3 agonist will prevent these effects. Indeed, TNF-\u03b1 increased levels of Rho-GTP (active form), PPAR\u03b3 activation reduces the levels of Rho-GTP to control levels. Taken together, these results suggest a novel role for PPAR\u03b3 agonist in modulation of monocyte-endothelial interactions mediated in part through Rho activation. Utilization of PPAR\u03b3 agonists approved for clinical use may offer new therapeutic approach in preventing BBB dysfunction seen in HIV-1 brain infection.",

The GOAL of this study was to determine a potential role for leukocyte recruitment in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Methods: Epilepsy was induced by injection of C57Bl mice with pilocarpine. Intravital microscopy was performed in brain vessels postseizures. Immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, magnetic resonance imaging, telemetry, behavioral evaluation and cognitive evaluation based on enriched open-field revealed were also performed. Results: In humans we observed granulocytes and T cells accumulation into the epileptic brains. We next verified whether leukocyte recruitment plays a role in the pathogenesis of a widely used experimental model of epilepsy. We found increased permeability, vasodilatation and expression of VCAM-1 after status epilepticus (SE) and repeated seizures. Electron microscopy and magnetic resonance imaging show that granulocytes and T cells migrate into the brain post-seizures. Intravital microscopy shows that blockade of alpha4 integrins and VCAM-1 inhibits granulocytes and Th1 lymphocytes rolling and arrest in brain vessels. Therapeutic treatment of mice with anti-alpha4-integrin mAb leads to a drastic reduction of seizures. Moreover, cognitive evaluation revealed that anti-alpha4 treated animals present a significant preservation of the behavior compared to epileptic mice. Strikingly, preventive administration of anti-alpha4integrin therapy, inhibits induction of SE and completely blocks recurrent seizures and development of epilepsy. Conclusion: The results demonstrate an unexpected key role for leukocyte recruitment in the pathogenesis of epilepsy and that anti-leukocyte adhesion therapy has preventive and therapeutic effect in a human model of epilepsy. Background: Although the development of multiple sclerosis (MS) plaques is mainly driven by a Th1 type inflammatory response, the exact mechanism how such restricted populations of T lymphocytes can penetrate into CNS parenchyma is still obscure. Materials and methods: We developed a novel system to evaluate the characters of T lymphocytes attached on and intruded into and beneath human brain microvascular endothelial cell (BMEC) monolayer, using pseudo-3D analysis with confocal laser microscopy. Lymphocytes were obtained from healthy volunteers and MS patients at acute stage. CD4 + lymphocytes were selected and seeded on the TNF\u03b1-stimulated human BMEC monolayer. After 6 h, cells were fixed, immonostained, and then the proportion of CD4 + CXCR3 + lymphocytes (representing Th1 cells) and CD4 + CCR4 + lymphocytes (Th2 cells) (1) attached on the surface of BMEC monolayer and (2) migrated into and beneath BMEC monolayer was quantitatively analyzed using this system. Results: In healthy volunteers, lymphocytes migrated beneath BMEC monolayer were significantly Th2 dominant. Conversely, in MS patients at acute stage, most of the Th2 cells stayed on the surface of monolayer and migrated/intruded lymphocytes were significantly Th1 dominant. Conclusion: Intrusion of T cells into CNS parenchyma might be regulated at the blood-brain barrier and this mechanism is possibly impaired in acute MS patients.",

The object of this study was to determine which factors produced by astrocytes contribute to BBB function and integrity. Using human CNS-derived endothelial cells and astrocytes, we have demonstrated that astrocytes express Angiotensinogen (AGT) and produce Angiotensin II, while human brain endothelial cells (HBECs) express angiotensin receptors AT 1 and AT 2 , both in vitro and in situ. The addition of astrocyte conditioned media, Ang II or AT receptor agonist to HBEC cultures induced an important decrease in monolayer permeability as well as specific changes in phosphorylation of the tight junction protein occludin and its concentration into lipid rafts, where tight junctions are assembled. Furthermore, this effect of astrocyte conditioned media could be blocked by the addition of AT 1 but not AT 2 receptor antagonist. The presence of inflammatory cytokines IFN\u03b3 and/or TNF\u03b1 in the astrocyte cultures blocked their ability to produce Ang II. In addition, using brain sections from normal and MS patients we could demonstrate that blood vessel-proximal human astrocytes in normal brain express AGT and this expression is lost around brain endothelium in active MS lesions. We conclude from these studies that astrocyte-derived angiotensin II, acting via the AT1 receptor, is necessary for BBB integrity.",

Inflammatory cell trafficking into the brain complicates several neurological disorders and conceivably depends on mechanisms that regulate tight junction opening. A detailed study of tight junction dynamics during immune cell diapedesis has been lacking. Therefore, we retrovirally expressed the tight junction protein occludin N-terminally tagged to green fluorescent protein (GFP) in rat brain endothelial cells. Confocal microscopy analyses revealed that GFP-occludin colocalized with the intracellular tight junction protein, ZO-1, and was completely absent at cell borders lacking apposing cells. Mutant cells retained endothelial properties including cell morphology, endothelial markers, proliferation rate and adhesive capacity. By means of live cell imaging studies we show that monocytes scroll over the brain endothelial cell surface towards cell-cell contacts, induce gap formation, which is associated with local disappearance of GFP-occludin, and subsequently traverse the endothelium in a paracellular fashion. Immunoblot analyses indicate that loss of occludin was due to protein degradation. Interestingly, occludin contains a putative extracellular MMP cleavage site and using the broad spectrum MMP-inhibitor BB-3103 we show that gap formation, loss of occludin and diapedesis were indeed dependent on the activity of matrix metalloproteinases.",

We found that highly purified LTA disrupted BBB integrity in a concentration-and time-dependent manner indirectly, through glia activation. Low trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and high permeability to fluorescein isothiocyanate-inulin observed in the presence of LTA-activated glial cells were potentiated by MDP and could be reversed only when glial cells were activated with LTA at 10 \u03bcg/ml but not with higher LTA concentrations (30 \u03bcg/ml). Immunocytochemistry analysis revealed no evident changes in the distribution of the cytoskeleton protein F-actin and tight junction protein occludin and claudin after LTA treatment. However, the tight junction associated protein AHNAK clearly revealed the morphological alteration of the endothelial cells induced by LTA. LTA-activated glial cells produced nitric oxide (NO) and proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) that contributed to LTA-induced BBB disruption, since the direct treatment of the endothelial monolayer with TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 increased BBB permeability, whereas the pre-treatment with antibodies against these two cytokines blocked LTA effects. Additionally, NO was also involved in BBB damage, since the NO donor itself (diethylenetriamine-nitric oxide adduct) increased blood-brain barrier permeability and inducible nitric synthase inhibitor (1400 W) partially reversed LTA-induced decrease of trans-endothelial electrical resistance.",

Methods: SV40 T-antigen immortalized human brain microvascular endothelial cells (THBMECs) were cultured to confluence and treated with various concentrations of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 for 24 h. CCL2 production, a marker of endothelial activation was measured by ELISA, and cell viability ascertained by phase contrast microscopy and Annexin V immunocytochemistry. Transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) was measured in collagen-coated Transwell\u2122 inserts. Following deduction of physiologic endothelial activation, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 expression were studied by flow cytometry, with fibronectin connecting segment (FN CS)-1 expression deduced by immunocytochemistry. Results: Following endothelial activation, CCL2 production doubled from \u223c 600 pg/mL at rest to 1200 pg/mL. 10 U/mL TNF-\u03b1 and 20 U/mL IFN-\u03b3 (10:20 aTHBMECs) maximally produced CCL2, without compromise to cell viability. There was no change in TEER between the resting and 10:20 aTHBMECs (\u223c100 \u03a9 cm 2 ), with a progressive decline in resistance with higher cytokine concentrations due to loss of cell-cell contacts secondary to apoptosis-induced cell retraction and death. There was a 450% increase in ICAM-1 and 80% increase in FN CS-1 THBMEC surface expression, with minimal VCAM-1 expression at rest or following physiologic cytokine activation. Conclusions: The 10:20 aTHBMECs form a physiologic aIVBBB that recapitulates the in vivo cerebral microvascular inflammatory milieu. This model can be used to accurately assess chemokine-driven leukocyte transmigration ex vivo as a means of understanding mechanisms and devising potential therapies for neuroinflammation. Purpose: In autoimmune disorders of peripheral nervous system (PNS) such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, breakdown of blood-nerve barrier (BNB) has been considered as a key step in the disease process. BNB is also an obstacle for drug delivery in PNS disorders. Hence, it is important to know cellular property of peripheral nerve microvascular endothelial cells (PnMECs) constituting bulk of the BNB. Although many in vitro models of bloodbrain barrier (BBB) have been established, very few in vitro BNB models have been reported. So, we established new in vitro BNB models using transgenic rat harboring temperature-sensitive SV40 large T-antigen gene (tsA58 rat) and investigated whether these models posses characteristics as BNB. Method: PnMECs and pericytes were isolated from sciatic nerves of tsA58 rat according to a previously described procedure. PnMECs were identified by the following four criteria: spindle fiber-shaped morphology, immunoreactivity to anti-factor VIII antibody, formation of tight junction and uptake of DiI-Ac-LDL. Pericytes are identified by their peculiar morphology and expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin. Results: We successfully isolated PnMECs and pericytes from tsA58 rat and these cells are conditionally immortalized nature. PnMECs showed spindle fiber-shaped morphology and expressed uptake of DiI-Ac-LDL, immunoreactivity to anti-factor VIII antibody and barrier properties. Consequently, we built complete in vitro BNB models comprised of PnMECs and pericytes. Conclusions: We established in vitro BNB models from tsA58 rat. These models might facilitate analyses for pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases of PNS, moreover, prediction of in vivo drug transportation into PNS parenchyma.",

However these studies are hindered by the difficulty of identifying the initial sites of infiltration in such a complex target organ. To overcome this problem we have utilised another model of autoimmunity, Experimental Autoimmune Uveoretinitis (EAU), in which the target organ is smaller and the location of lymphocyte infiltration is easier to dissect. We generated retinal antigen specific GFP expressing T lymphocytes and tracked their migration to the eye in Lewis rats. We recovered cells from various lymphoid organs and examined their activation status. We characterised the infiltration of these cells into the eye, defining the precise locations of entry and studying macrophage infiltration and antigen presentation. Surgical manipulation and injection of soluble antigen enabled us to dissect the mechanisms further. Our results demonstrate that following transfer of activated GFP T lymphocytes organ specific accumulation was not observed until two days after transfer when the cells reappeared in the spleen in large numbers in a non-activated state. On day three the cells migrated via the blood (still non-activated) and started appearing in the eye where they strongly express activation markers. Activation occurs in the eye at the sites of initial infiltration (iris and ciliary body). This is in concurrence with published observations in EAE and demonstrates that these mechanisms are not specific to particular diseases.",

            "text": "The homeostatic chemokine CCL19 is constitutively expressed in the CNS, up-regulated in multiple sclerosis lesions, and is correlated with intrathecal IgG production This study focused on the homeostatic chemokines CCL19 and CCL21, which both bind to CCR7 and direct B cells, mature dendritic cells, and a subset of T cells to secondary lymphoid organs. We report that in the normal human brain CCL19 is transcribed, detectable in tissue lysates, and displayed on endothelial cells. In both active and inactive MS lesions CCL19 transcripts were elevated and strong CCL19 immunostaining of astrocytes and blood vessel endothelial cells was seen. In cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from relapsing remitting and secondary progressive MS patients CCL19 was elevated and correlated with intrathecal IgG production. CCL21, the other CCR7 ligand, was not detected in control or MS CSF samples, and quantitative PCR and immunostaining showed only very low levels of this chemokine in MS lesions. Together, this study suggests a role of CCL19 in immunosurveillance of the CNS and maintenance of immune cells in MS brains. Active multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by the presence of perivascular inflammatory foci localized in the central nervous system (CNS). Inflammatory cells forming those foci migrate from the blood to the CNS. Several studies confirmed that chemokines and their receptors play an important role in that process. The major goal of this study was to analyze the migratory activity of subpopulations of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from the blood of MS patients stimulated by chemokine CCL5/RANTES. Moreover the impact of MS treatment with methylprednisolone (active MS) and mitoxantrone (progressing MS) on CCL5-induced chemotactic activity of PBMC subpopulations was analyzed. Chemotactic activity of mononuclear leukocytes was measured in vitro in Neuroprobe MBA96 chemotaxis chamber using fluorimetric reader. We observed that in active MS before any treatment in vitro chemotactic activity of lymphocytes after stimulation with CCL5 was significantly increased. Spontaneous migration of lymphocytes was similar in all studied groups. Treatment of MS with methylprednisolone and mitoxantrone diminished this activity to the level observed in control groups of patients with other neurological diseases (OND) and healthy controls (HC). This effect was dose dependent. We did not observe any significant changes in spontaneous and stimulated by CCL5 migratory activity of monocytes from MS patients. Our results suggest that in active MS chemokine-induced migratory activity of lymphocytes is increased. This activity may be significantly diminished by treatment with methylprednisolone and mitoxantrone. Objective: Acute cerebral ischaemia induces local inflammatory reaction including expression of chemokines, which precedes relevant leukocyte infiltration contributing to tissue injury. The objective of the study was to test hypothesis that CXCL1 and CXCL6 chemokines, potent neutrophil chemoattractants, play a role in inflammation during early phase of ischaemic stroke. Methods: The CXCL1 and CXCL6 levels in the CSF and serum obtained during 24 h from 23 ischaemic stroke patients aged 72.2 +/\u2212 10.8 years have been measured by ELISA. CSF and blood samples from 15 tension headache patients served as a control group. The neurological stroke severity was estimated with Scandinavian Stroke Scale (SSS) within 24 h of stroke (SSS-1) and two weeks later (SSS-2). Results: CXCL1 and CXCL6 levels were significantly elevated in the CSF of patients with ischaemic stroke in comparison with controls (65.6 +/ \u2212 22.3 pg/ml vs. 43.8 +/\u2212 2.3 pg/ml for CXCL1 and 3.1 +/\u2212 0.9 pg/ml vs. 1.8 +/\u2212 0.7 pg/ml for CXCL6). Serum levels of studied chemokines did not differ from control values. CSF CXCL1 and CXCL6 levels correlated significantly with the neurological stroke severity within 24 h and after two weeks from the onset of stroke. This is the first such observation. Conclusions: Our results suggest that CXCL1 and CXCL6 chemokines may play a role in the inflammatory reaction during early phase of ischaemic stroke and CSF CXCL1 and CXCL6 levels are associated with stroke severity and have predictive value for short term stroke outcome. It is well documented that chemokines play an important role in development of inflammatory foci through regulation of cell trafficking within tissues. This multistep process occurs also within the central nervous system (CNS) in many pathological conditions. In a present study we have investigated the role of chemokines and their receptors in the development of CNS inflammation using previously described model of local CNS inflammation. In this model inflammatory focus develops after deposition of BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) into the brain parenchyma followed by subcutaneous peripheral injection of BCG four weeks later. Accumulation of inflammatory cells around the site of BCG deposition is followed by a subsequent myelin damage. Expression of inflammatory (CCL5) and constitutive (CCL19, CCL21, CX3CL1) chemokines as well as chemokine receptors CCR5, CCR7 and CX3CR1 was analyzed. We performed RNA expression analysis using quantitative RPA assay. For localization of protein expression we used immunohistochemistry. Pathological features of inflammation were confirmed by analysis of expression of many specific markers of inflammatory cell subpopulations. Within 7 days post peripheral challenge we have observed an increase of CCL19 expression in a hemisphere injected with BCG. Interestingly in 10 days post peripheral challenge subsequent increase in contralateral hemisphere was also observed. A similar pattern of expression was also observed for chemokine CCL5. In contralateral hemisphere increase of this expression was observed 2 weeks after peripheral challenge. Our results confirm that some chemokines and their receptors play an important role in the control of cell trafficking during CNS inflammation.",

Raine a a Department of Pathology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, USA Factors responsible for oligodendrocyte survival, a feature observed around early and active multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions, are not fully elucidated. Existing evidence in rodents demonstrate that the chemokine, CXCL1, induces proliferation and inhibits chemotaxis of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). To investigate the effects of CXC chemokines during the course of central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory responses, we generated CXCL1/GFAP double-transgenic (Tg) mice, which overexpress CXCL1 inducibly under the control of the astrocyte specific gene, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Double (CXCL1/ GFAP)-Tg, single (CXCL1)-Tg and wildtype (wt) animals were sensitized with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) for experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). After onset of clinical signs, CXCL1 production was initiated by intraperitoneal doxycycline injection (500 \u03bcg/animal). Preliminary results show that double-Tg animals display much milder clinical disease. Histopathology revealed that although inflammation was present in spinal cord and optic nerve tissue of double-Tg, single-Tg, and wt control animals by 15 days post-immunization (d.p. i.), demyelination and axonal pathology (Wallerian degeneration, WD) were more prominent in the control mice. By 40 d.p.i., inflammation and demyelination were significantly diminished in double-Tg mice, compared to controls, and WD was markedly less. Interestingly, relative to the levels of myelin and axonal pathology, remyelination was greater in the double-Tg group, and there was an associated increase in oligodendrocytes, suggestive of an oligodendroglial response. Ongoing protein expression studies are examining inflammatory infiltrates, OPCs, and proliferation (BrdU incorporation) within the CNS. Thus, preliminary findings suggest a role for CXCL1 in exerting a neuroprotective role during the course of EAE.",

To further explore the compared physiology between the immune and nervous system, we combined genome-wide expression analysis with a new bioinformatics method to identify functional networks involving Nur77 in thymic negative selection. We used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, a new web-based entry tool, which provides molecular networks with a high degree of connectivity over all genes documented in the literature. A systematic temporal expression profiling of thymocytes from TCR transgenic mice undergoing thymic negative selection was generated using Agilent oligonucleotide microarrays. The level of expression of a 44,000 probe set representing around 22,000 mouse known genes was monitored with 9 kinetics time points over a 24 h period, with a focus on 6 early time points over 3 h. Dynamically regulated genes identified using Resolver software were overlaid onto the cellular pathway maps in the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software application to generate very significant high-scoring networks, including Nur77 in the early time points.

Using primary human astrocytes and ex vivo human monocytes (representative of microglia), we report that astrocytes modulate monocyte activation depending on the nature of the inflammatory stimulus. When monocytes are co-cultured with primary astrocytes in the presence of LPS, monocyte secretion of TNF-\u03b1 is completely inhibited, whereas there is no inhibition when CD40 ligand is the stimulus. These data suggest that within the human CNS, pathogenmediated inflammation (LPS) is, at least in part, naturally inhibited by astrocytes, whereas T cell-mediated inflammation (CD40 ligand) is not. This observation has relevance to regulation of T cell-mediated inflammation within the CNS, including that associated with multiple sclerosis and responses to brain tumors. Indeed, using a transformed primary malignant glioma (Glioblastoma Multiformae or GBM) cell line, we have found that, in contrast to non-transformed primary human astrocytes, GBM tumor cells acquire the ability to suppress monocyte secretion of TNF-\u03b1 in response to both LPS and CD40 ligand stimulation. Transwell assays indicate that both soluble and cell-contact dependent mechanisms are responsible for tumor cell-mediated suppression of monocyte activation, and neutralization studies exclude TGF-\u03b2, IL-10, COX 2 and CD200 as molecules associated with this suppression.

IC-introduced mOVA/H-2K b\u2212/\u2212 splenocytes induce higher in vivo CD8 + T cell killing, interferon gamma production, and proliferation than when administered SC or IV. CD8 + T cell priming from cross-presented IC antigen occurs in the cervical lymph nodes and requires CD4 + T cell help. In addition, CD8 + T cell priming due to crosspresentation, but not direct presentation, requires CD40 expression by the host. Taken together, these data imply that an immune response resulting from cross-presentation of IC antigen, once initiated, is more efficient and therefore more likely to induce immune priming compared with responses initiated elsewhere in the body. Similar to other tissues, antigen crosspresentation from the CNS requires CD40 expression by the host, presumably mediating helper-dependent cross-priming of CD8 + T cells specific to CNS-derived antigen.",

In this study we show that na\u00efve T cells can be activated by local resident accessory cells in nervous tissue in the absence of peripheral immune organs. To define CNS-restricted na\u00efve T cell activation, we prepared brain slice cultures from experimental animals and maintained these tissues in artificial cerebral spinal fluid for several days. One hour prior to the preparation of brain slice cultures, mice were injected intracerebrally with ovalbumin antigen. When na\u00efve OT-1 ovalbumin-specific CD8 + T cells were added to these cultures, these T cells become activated, proliferated and migrated into the brain slices which contained cognate antigens. Brain resident dendritic cell-like accessory cells (CD11c + ) were also mobile and able to migrate from the brain slices in the presence of inflammatory chemokine, MIP-3\u03b2. Proliferation of OT1 antigen-specific T cells and the migration of brain resident accessory cells were abrogated by the deletion of CD11c + cells from Itgax-DTR/EGFP mice prior to the generation of brain slices. Due to the transgene expression, CD11c expressing cells can be selectively depleted (huDTR) and/or identified (GFP fluorescence) in these mice. Our results suggest that antigen presentation could take place locally in the brain and this event may be important in the initiation of CNS inflammatory diseases.",

The exact mechanism by which DCs are instructing/influencing the generation of regulatory versus effector T cells is not clear. TGF-\u03b2 is an important immunoregulatory molecule and is implicated in the induction of regulatory T cells. We found that TGF-\u03b2 is present on the surface of immature human DCs in the form of latency associated peptide (LAP). FACS analysis of human ex-vivo isolated DCs showed membrane bound LAP. The functional importance of surface TGF-\u03b2 on DCs was assessed by neutralization with recombinant LAP or anti-TGF-\u03b2 antibody. Such neutralization resulted in enhanced T cell proliferation and IFN-\u03b3 secretion by allogeneic CD4 + T cells incubated with ex-vivo isolated human DCs. Furthermore, when DCs were matured by stimulation with LPS so they were no longer tolerogenic, we observed the loss of membrane bound LAP, accompanied by up-modulation of HLAII and co-stimulatory molecules CD80, CD83, CD86 and CD40. Furthermore, initial results demonstrate altered tolerogenic properties of DC subpopulations in MS. Taken together, our results indicate that expression of TGF-\u03b2 on DCs in the form of LAP may play an important role in the tolerogenic properties of immature DCs, which serve to limit or prevent autoimmune responses and this may be abnormal in MS.",

In contrast, functional changes to whole CD4 + CD25 \u2212 T cells were pronounced in aged mice. We separated CD4 T cells into small subpopulations based on the staining with Rhodamine-123 (R123).

The differential expression pattern was evident especially on the CD45RO + CCR6 + effector memory-like T cell subsets, where the loss of VLA-4 was compensated on Treg cells by the expression of CLA (cutaneous lymphocyte antigen). CD45RO + CCR6 + Treg cells therefore bind efficiently to the CLA-ligand E-selectin, whereas CD4 + effector T cells preferentially adhere to the VLA-4 ligand VCAM-1.

Recently, NKT cells were found to have the potential to suppress the development of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), opening up the possibility as a therapeutic target for multiple sclerosis (MS).

We have found that, although human CD4 + NKT cell clones cocultured with CD1d + antigen presenting cells (APCs) do not produce cytokines, by adding exogenous IL-2, a significant number of clones selectively and remarkably produced IL-5. Methods: Human CD4 + CD1d-restricted NKT cell clones were established by stimulating fresh PBMC with \u03b1-galactosylceramide or OCH, its synthetic analogue, and then sorting for invariant TCR + /V\u03b211 + /CD4 + /CD8 \u2212 cells. The NKT cell clones were co-cultured with APCs with or without recombinant IL-2, and cytokines in the supernatant were evaluated. Results: When co-cultured with APCs, 8 out of 24 NKT cell clones (including those of MS patients) produced remarkable amounts of IL-5 but little IFN\u03b3 in the presence, but not in the absence, of IL-2. CD1d-expressing Hela cells as well as immature DCs served as good APCs, whereas mocktransfected Hela cells did not. CD4 + NKT cells freshly isolated from BALB/ c mice similarly showed a Th2 polarization pattern, supporting the physiological implications of our findings. Conclusion: Taken together, IL-2 plays a key role in triggering the Th2 polarizing potential of CD4 + NKT cells in response to weak endogenous antigen stimulation.

We have demonstrated that OCH, a sphingosine-truncated analogue of \u03b1GC, prevents a variety of experimental autoimmune disease models including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by inducing the preferential NKT cell-dependent IL-4 production and subsequent Th2 polarization in vivo. Biochemical and molecular biological analysis revealed that the specific feature of the glycolipid is due to its unstable capture on CD1d and a short-lived stimulation to NKT cells, which is insufficient for effective c-Rel induction followed by the lack of effective IFN-\u03b3 production. Intriguingly, OCH induces less IFN-\u03b3 production not only by NKT cells but also by natural killer (NK) cells, another major source of IFN-\u03b3 after glycolipid administration in vivo. Due to an insufficient primary IFN-\u03b3 production and CD40L expression by activated NKT cells, OCH exert marginal IL-12 production by dendritic cells, resulted in lower secondary IFN-\u03b3 induction by NKT and NK cells. Accordingly, the availability of IL-12 in connection with microbial infection is one of the critical determinants for the cytokine profile after in vivo administration of OCH. Taken together, OCH has a unique property for selective IL-4 production by NKT cells without inducing IFN-\u03b3 production by NKT and NK cells. A proper application of OCH in vivo is beneficial for a NKT cell-targeted therapeutic intervention of Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Recent studies have demonstrated that myelin-reactive IL-17-producing T cells would efficiently mediate the destructive autoimmune pathology of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Therefore, the IL-23-IL-17 pathway could be pivotal in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. Although much needs to be learned about the characteristics of IL-17 producing T cells, CCL2 is known to augment the T cell production of IL-17. This allowed us to address if IL-17 producing T cells might express CCR2, the CCL2 receptor. Of interest, CCR2 is highly expressed within MS plaques and CCR2 knockout mice are resistant to EAE. When whole T cells, CCR2 + or CCR2 \u2212 T cells purified from healthy donor blood were activated by PMA and ionomycin for 1 day, only CCR2 + T cells produced a large amount of IL-17. Both CCR2 + and CCR2 \u2212 populations produced IFN-\u03b3. In sharp contrast, CCR5 + T cells, but not CCR5-T cells, produced IFN-\u03b3, whereas both of the populations produced IL-17 equally. Notably, most CCR2 + T cells coexpress CCR5, and only a minor population expresses CCR2 alone. We found that the minor CCR2 + CCR5 \u2212 fraction was the main source of IL-17. The CCR2 single positive cells also produced IFN-\u03b3, but it was much less than that from CCR2 + CCR5 + fraction. To conclude, we have identified CCR2 + CCR5 \u2212 T cells in the human blood as IL-17-producing T cells, which is consistent with that IL-17-producing T cells would develop via a lineage distinct from the Th1 lineage.",

These results are of pivotal importance due to the possible utilization of MSC for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. We refolded bacterially produced HuMOG and compared pathogenicity of refolded HuMOG versus non-refolded HuMOG in DA rats. Whereas DA rats immunized with non-refolded HuMOG remained perfectly healthy, DA rats immunized with refolded HuMOG developed severe disease. No differences in MOG-directed T-cell responses could be observed between both groups. In contrast, MOG serum antibodies from both groups differed in their capacity of binding native MOG expressed on the surface of eukaryotic cells as measured by FACS. Thus, enhanced pathogenicity of refolded HuMOG in DA rats is probably due to the presence of conformational MOG antibodies upon immunization. These data underscore the importance of using correctly refolded HuMOG for studying MOG antibody responses in MS patients. The precise role of B cells and humoral immunity in both Multiple Sclerosis (MS) as well as Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) remains a subject of intense debate. While intrathecal immunoglobulin (Ig) production and Ig-deposition in inflammatory lesions is a hallmark of MS, mice deficient in B cells and Igs have been shown to develop severe EAE. On the other hand, mice deficient in FcR\u00e3, the signaling entity of activating Fc-receptors, are resistant to EAE-induction. To resolve this apparent paradox we generated mice deficient in both B cells and FcR\u00e3 and induced EAE through immunization with both recombinant MOG 1-121 protein or MOG 35-55 peptide. The functional expression of FcR\u00e3 on systemic accessory cells, but not CNS-resident cells, appears to be vital for the development of CNS-inflammation independent of lymphocytes. While these data clearly dismiss any involvement of B cells as mediators in EAE, we found that the injection of Abs directed against MOG drastically worsens EAE severity, inflammation and demyelination in MOG induced EAE. The action of such Abs is again FcR independent and relies entirely on complement activation, as they have no detrimental effect in C1q \u2212/\u2212 mice. We conclude that Abs generated during the course of MOG-peptide orprotein induced EAE are irrelevant for the pathogenesis of EAE, but that under certain conditions Abs are capable of driving demyelination in an FcR\u00e3-independent but complement-dependent fashion.",

Although genetic factors were employed to account for the relapsing-remitting course of this EAE, we found that immunization of SJL/J mice with an overlapping peptide PLP136-150 induced monophasic EAE without relapse, indicating that peptide sequence used for primary immunization is critical for determining the clinical course. Whereas both immunodominant PLP peptides induced cross-reactive T cells, immunization with PLP136-150 tended to generate Th2-biased population, as compared to PLP139-151. More strikingly, mice in the recovery phase of PLP136-150-EAE were completely resistant against re-induction of EAE; whereas PLP139-151-EAE mice were fully susceptible to EAE re-induction. Furthermore, we found that after recovery from PLP136-150-induced EAE, suppressor cells would emerge in the draining lymph nodes (LN) that could confer protection against EAE upon cell transfer. These suppressive LN cell populations contained a higher number of adaptive regulatory CD4 + CD25 + T cells (Treg) that would co-express CD103 and CD69. Adoptive transfer experiment showed that CD103 + CD69 + Treg cells induced by PLP136-150 immunization have the highest potency to suppress EAE in vivo. Our results indicate that the benign nature of PLP136-150 induced EAE may result from the induction of strongly suppressive CD103 + CD69 + Treg cells.",

Chronic EAE was induced in LEW.1AV1 rats by immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and the results obtained were compared with those from acute EAE. In chronic EAE, CD25 + T cells in EAE lesions in the central nervous system (CNS) decreased rapidly at the beginning of the disease, while these cells were maintained at high levels during the recovery from acute EAE. Consistent with this finding, the levels of Foxp3 mRNA in the CNS was significantly lower throughout the course of chronic EAE than that at the recovery of acute EAE. The number of Foxp3 + CD4 + CD25 + Treg and the levels of Foxp3 mRNA in the lymphoid organ were also significantly lower in chronic EAE. However, there was no difference in the regulatory function of individual CD4 + CD25 + Treg cells isolated during the disease course between acute and chronic EAE. Furthermore, the adoptive transfer of CD4 + CD25 + Treg that had been activated with anti-CD28 mAb (JJ316) delayed the onset of chronic EAE (after one transfer) and suppressed the development of the disease completely (after two transfers). These findings suggest that impairment of the CD4 + CD25 + Treg response, but not the function of individual cells, is critical for the development of chronic autoimmune diseases and can be adjustable by autologous Treg transplantation.",

Here, we explored the migratory behavior of CSFcirculating DCs under neuroinflammatory conditions. For this purpose, bone marrow-derived myeloid DCs were labeled with a fluorescent marker (CFSE) then injected stereotaxically into the lateral ventricles of EAE rats. Rats were sacrificed on day 1 or 8 following injections and brains, cervical lymph nodes and axillary lymph nodes were assessed for the presence of CFSE-labeled cells. In addition, intraventricular injections of fluorescent microspheres were performed in order to track endogenous CSF-circulating antigen presenting cells. We found that in the CNS, injected DCs localized in meninges, velums, Virchow-Robin spaces and in several periventricular areas. Similar results were obtained when tracking endogenous MHC class II + cells with fluorescent microspheres. In the lymph nodes, CFSE-labeled DCs were evidenced in the B-cell zones of cervical but not axillary lymph nodes. Similarly, cells having engulfed fluorescent microspheres were detected in the B-cell zone of cervical but not axillary lymph nodes. Finally, using Western blot analysis, we observed that IgG recovered from cervical versus axillary lymph nodes differ qualitatively and quantitatively in their ability to recognize CNS antigens. Altogether, these results suggest that during EAE, CSF-circulating DCs may be responsible for the development of a preponderant B-cell response, which takes place within the cervical lymph nodes.",

EAE can be induced by s.c. immunization with myelin antigens such as myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). Secondary lymphoid tissues are widely held to be vital for the initiation of adaptive immunity. Here we demonstrate that alymphoplasia (aly) mice, which are characterized by the complete lack of lymph nodes (LNs) and peyer's patches, are resistant to EAE induced by s.c. immunization with MOG. However, the immunodeficiency results from the impact the aly lesion has on immunity but not from the lack of lymphoreticular structures. This led to the exciting understanding that vaccination induced autoimmunity of the CNS can develop autonomously and without dedicated immune structures. We clearly show that while B cell activation requires a lymphoreticular system and germinal center formation, T cell immunity functions independent of secondary lymphoid tissues. We demonstrate that in the absence of secondary lymphoid tissues the liver acts as a site where primary immunity can occur. Inflammation induced tertiary follicles are well described.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for multiple sclerosis (MS), is induced in Lewis rats with rat myelin basic protein (MBP) peptide MBP68-86 in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Although the role of mycobacteria is unclear, it is required for the induction of EAE. To investigate whether Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists can replace mycobacteria in adjuvant, we immunized rats with MBP68-86 in incomplete adjuvant (lacking mycobacteria), but supplemented with TLR agonists. Rats immunized with either 100 \u03bcg MBP68-86 plus 100-300 \u03bcg cytosineguanine dinucleotide-containing oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG), a TLR9 agonist, or MBP68-86 plus 50 \u03bcg lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a TLR4 agonist, did not develop EAE, although their T cells proliferated and secreted interferon-gamma when stimulated with MBP68-86. In contrast, rats immunized with 100 \u03bcg MBP68-86 plus 100 \u03bcg CpG and 50 \u03bcg LPS developed clinical EAE. Spleen cells proliferated and secreted interferongamma in response to MBP68-86, and secreted IL-12 in response to CpG or LPS, but not to MBP68-86, suggesting that the TLR agonists promote a Th1 response. Thus, a combination of CpG and LPS can substitute for mycobacteria for induction of EAE. We conclude that a combination of TLR agonists, in the presence of autoantigen, can trigger autoimmune disease via the innate immune system. (Supported by NIH NS06985-37 and NS 048070-02.)",

However, a rare autosomal recessive condition, Nasu-Hakola disease (NHD) is associated with loss-of-function mutations in DAP12 and TREM-2. The brain pathology observed in NHD patients suggests that disruption of the TREM-2/DAP12 pathway leads to neurodegeneration with demyelination and axonal loss. The AIM of this study was to determine the role of TREM-2 in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Methods: TREM-2 protein expression was investigated using a newly produced monoclonal antibody (MAb) against the mouse TREM-2 receptor. EAE was induced in C57BL/6 mice with the MOG 35-55 peptide. Blocking effect of anti-mouse-TREM-2 MAb was assessed using BWZ.36-TREM-2 cell reporter system. Results: TREM-2 protein expression was demonstrated in vitro on macrophages, microglia and dendritic cells. We report that TREM-2 was up-regulated in the spinal cord during both the early inflammatory and chronic phases of EAE. We also demonstrate that TREM-2 was highly expressed on microglial cells in the CNS during EAE. Blockade of TREM-2, obtained treating the mice with the anti-TREM-2 MAb in the effector phase of EAE, results in disease exacerbation with more diffuse CNS inflammatory infiltrates and demyelination in the spinal cord.

In this study we show that type 1 interferon receptordeficient mice (IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 ) were highly susceptible to experimental autoimmune disease (EAE) and developed a more severe disease course with increased CNS inflammation, demyelination and lethality. Since IFNAR is expressed by most in the body, little is known about the actual target tissue during disease. To clarify this, we used Cre/loxP-mediated gene targeting to investigate the cell-specific function of IFNAR in vivo. Mice with a specific IFNAR deletion in the central nervous system (Nestin-CreIFNARflox/flox) revealed no differences in the clinical course and showed compatible tissue damage in the CNS compared to WT controls, indicating that type 1 interferons do not have a direct protective impact on the CNS. Interestingly, neither T cell (CD4 \u2212 CreIFNARflox/flox) nor B cell (CD19 \u2212 CreIFNARflox/flox)-specific IFNAR deletion influenced the clinical course and cellular composition of infiltrating cells. However, IFNAR deletion on macrophages/neutrophils (LysM-CreIFNARflox/flox) led to severe disease with an enhanced effector phase and increased disease lethality as seen in IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 mice. Deletion of IFNAR in macrophages induced altered MHC class II expression and change of cytokine and chemokine production. In summary, we show that IFNAR triggering, specifically on myeloid cells, but not lymphocytes or CNS cells, is crucial for immunomodulatory effects of type 1 IFN during autoimmune CNS disease.",

MS predominantly follows a relapsingremitting disease course, although a minority of patients develop a primary progressive form of disease. EAE is a widely used animal model of MS. EAE can follow either a relapsing-remitting (RR) or a chronic (CH) disease course. To date, the molecular and pathological differences that underlie these different forms of MS and EAE are not fully understood. We have assessed the expression of SOCS in the spinal cord in RR and CH EAE. Expression of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 mRNA increases in the early stages of RR disease and decreases during the subsequent remission phase. In contrast, SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 mRNA expression is elevated at all stages of CH disease. As the expression of SOCS is turned on by pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling, these data suggest that the inflammatory response is prolonged in the CH form of EAE. Expression of SOCS at the protein level was assessed in the spinal cord by immunohistochemistry. Expression of SOCS-1 was localized to immune cells within EAE lesions, while SOCS-3 was predominantly expressed in glial cells adjacent to lesions.

Results: Reactive spinal cord astrocytes upregulated Shh and SMO in EAE, especially around perivascular infiltrates and areas of demyelination, while Gli1 was downregulated. In vitro, NSCs treated with IFN-\u03b3 also downregulated Gli1. NSCs differentiated into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes when co-cultured with adult astrocytes, but anti-Shh significantly decreased the number and the maturity of neurons; Shhmediated NSC differentiation was significantly inhibited by IFN-\u03b3, which was independent of cell death.

To determine the effects of reduced PrP C expression in a model of MS, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), homozygous PrP C knockout (PrP \u2212/\u2212 ) mice and littermate wild type (PrP +/+ ) controls were treated with subcutaneous myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG 35-55 ) to induce EAE. Animals were monitored for clinical signs and graded daily. Brain and spinal cord sections from euthanized animals were stained with H-E and silver. PrP \u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited an earlier onset and a significantly more severe EAE phenotype than PrP +/+ controls in neurobehavioral score. During the EAE, H-E staining showed marked perivascular infiltration in brain. Silver staining showed the number of axons was reduced in spinal cord of PrP \u2212/\u2212 mice compared to PrP +/+ controls. These studies suggest that lack of PrP C expression dysregulates the EAE inflammatory response, and might also render CNS cells more susceptible to injury during. Elucidating the role of PrP C in EAE will lead not only to a better understanding of neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis but also raises the possibility that alterations in prion protein levels or function might be of therapeutic benefit.",

The attenuated disease was a consequence of decreased ability of activated CD5 \u2212/\u2212 T-cells to persist. This led to the discovery that CD5 had an engagement-dependent prosurvival activity in T-cells. To test the prediction that the prosurvival activity was mediated by CK2, an anti-apoptotic serine/ threonine kinase that constitutively associates with CD5, we generated mice that expressed CD5 unable bind/activate CK2 using transgenic and \"knockin\" approaches. Remarkably these CD5-CK2 binding/activation-deficient mice were very resistant to development of EAE. Resistance was not associated with absence of T-cell infiltration in the CNS but rather due to decrease in T H -cells that coexpress both \u03b3IFN and IL-17. The newly described T H 17 population of T-cells developed with equal efficiency in WT and CK2-binding/activation deficient CD5 mice. We further show that Tcells deficient in CD5-CK2 signaling hyperproliferate following primary stimulation, however, respond very poorly to restimulation compared to WT-CD5 T-cells. Our results indicate that the T H IFN\u03b3-IL17 is likely to be an important pathogenic effector population in multiple sclerosis. We also show that the CD5-CK2 pathway is an attenuator of T-cell activation and cell death. The coordinate effect of these activities of CD5 is likely to be important in differentiation and persistence of effector T-cells in autoimmunity and immunity to pathogens.

A key player in regulation of inflammatory gene expression is the nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) activated by phosphorylation and proteolytic degradation of inhibitory protein IkB. However, involvement of NF-kB of transcription factor in various immune-mediated diseases has been proposed but the direct supporting evidence is still lacking. To elucidate the roles of NF-kB and phospho-IkB in the development and progression of EAE, we investigated the expression of nuclear NF-kB (p65) and phospho-IkB in the central nervous system (CNS) of rats during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In Western blot analysis, phospho-IkB expressed rapidly at the early stage and increased significantly at the peak stage of disease. In addition, the expression of NF-kB increased at the early and peak stage followed by slight decline at the later stages. The expression of nuclear NF-kB and phospho-IkB was parallel to severity of EAE. Immunohistochemical studies showed that the NF-kB and phospho-IkB immunoreactivity was mainly expressed in inflammatory cells (macrophages, T cells) and glial cells (astrocytes, microglial cells) at the peak stage and disappeared at the recovery stage of disease.",

To test this hypothesis, mice immunized to develop experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) were monitored for antibody responses and NO production in plasma. Wild-type C57Bl/6 and NOS-2 null mice were immunized with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide 35-55 (MOG) followed a week later by a MOG booster and treatment with anti-inflammatory PPAR-gamma agonists. The strong increase of NO observed a week after immunization was lessened in low-dose treated mice and abolished in high-dose treated mice with no clinical signs. An increased antibody response was found two weeks after immunization in correlation with clinical signs arising a week later. In the absence of clinical signs there was no antibody response. NOS-2 null mice with EAE did not show increases in NO production over a month follow-up. Their antibody response was reduced by half and showed an opposite fluctuation compared to wild-types: treatment exacerbated the antibody response while clinical signs decreased it. These findings point to a complex role of PPAR-gamma agonists that may promote a Th2-driven antibody response in the absence of NO production which could explain the presence of an antibody response in NOS-2 null mice.",

Previous studies using the Cre-loxP system to delete Pten genes in developing thymocytes, have revealed defects in both thymic selection and T cell homeostasis. To examine the functional role of Pten specifically in mature effector T lymphocytes, and in the context of a normal pre-immune T-cell repertoire, we selected a system that allows Cre-mediated gene excisions to occur within CD8 + and CD4 + T cells subsequent to activation. This system, which employs the Granzyme B gene promoter to drive expression of the Cre recombinase upon TCR activation, was used to trigger excisions of exons 4 and 5 of the floxed Pten gene. In mice homozygous for the floxed allele, we were thus able to obtain Pten deletion specifically in a subset of activated T lymphocytes. To characterize this system further, we evaluated the efficiency of Pten gene deletion in mature T cells in vitro, and also studied the consequences of Pten loss in a model of T cell-mediated immunopathology, murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). EAE was induced by injection of a synthetic myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide (MOG 35-55) in complete Freund's adjuvant and Pertussis toxin. Initial clinical and neuropathological characterization of the MOG-immunized Granzyme B Cre x floxed Pten mice indicates that Pten plays a critical role in regulating not only the severity of EAE, but also the time-course of this disease.",

Brosnan Department of Pathology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, 10461, USA P2X 7 receptor (P2X 7 R), an ATP-gated ionotropic receptor, has been proposed to serve as a regulator of inflammation. In this study we tested whether the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for multiple sclerosis, was modified in animals lacking the P2X 7 R. In P2X 7 R \u2212/\u2212 mice clinical and pathological signs of EAE were more severe than in WT mice. Bone marrow radiation chimeras revealed that greater susceptibility to EAE was detected in chimeric mice of WT host engrafted with P2X 7 R \u2212/\u2212 BM cells, indicating that the genotype of the BM cells regulated disease susceptibility. In vitro, spleen and lymph node cells from P2X 7 R \u2212/\u2212 mice had a higher proliferative activity and less apoptosis in response to MOG peptide. Similarly, significantly fewer Annexin V/PI + and TUNEL positive lymphocytes were found in the CNS of P2X 7 R \u2212/\u2212 mice early in the disease. Cytokine profiles of the culture supernatants showed significantly decreased expression of IFN\u03b3 and IL-6 in MOG-activated spleen cells from P2X 7 R \u2212/\u2212 mice. QPCR and protein assays showed that protein for IL-1\u03b2 (but not mRNA), as well as mRNA and protein for IL-6 and IFN\u03b3 were significantly reduced in spinal cord homogenates. Indoleamine 2, 3-dioxgenase (IDO) production was also decreased in spinal cord homogenates of P2X 7 R \u2212/\u2212 mice. From these data we conclude that the enhanced susceptibility of P2X 7 R \u2212/\u2212 mice to EAE reflects a more vigorous proliferative response to MOG, lower levels of IFN\u03b3, nitric oxide and IDO compared to WT mice, which correlated with loss of apoptotic activity in lymphocytes.",

Here, we compared MRI and histopathology in a murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. Brainstem lesions were induced by the adoptive transfer of a PLP139-51 specific T-cell clone in SJL/J mice. 25 of 27 histopathologically identified acute EAE lesions were retrieved by T1and T2-weighted high-resolution 3D MRI. Lesions varied with respect to signal intensity on T1-and T2-weighted images. Two dominant MRI lesion patterns could be identified: Lesions with reduced signal intensity on T1-and T2-weighted MRI (type A) and lesions with isointense or slightly reduced signal intensity on T1-weighted MRI and increased signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI (type B). Type A lesions were characterized by significantly denser inflammatory cell infiltrations and more myelin and axonal loss than type B lesions. Comparative analysis revealed that lesional cellularity, myelin loss and axonal density correlated with signal intensities obtained by T1-and T2-weighted images in the lesion center. In perilesional areas, microglia cell numbers and Ig deposition correlated strongly with signal intensities on T2-weighted MRI. Gd-DTPA enhancement correlated with Ig deposition and mainly took place in areas with activated microglia cells. In summary, we established a mouse EAE model suitable for MR imaging. Given the robust correlation between MR signal intensities and histopathological changes the model can be used for MRI evaluation of new therapeutic strategies.",

Meningeal enhancement and T1 Gd enhancing parenchymal lesions started appearing as early as from 10 days dpi, while peak of \"active\" demyelinating lesions were recorded at clinical onset (17 dpi). Meningeal enhancement faded over time, progressively disappearing at the 25 dpi.

Neuropathological analysis confirmed the presence of lympho/monocyte infiltrates in meninges and parenchymal T1-weighted Gd-enhanced images. Further studies will be necessary to more carefully evaluate sensibility and specificity of human graded MR in detecting acute and chronic demyelination in EAE mice.

MSI is a newly developed technology that utilizes matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionisation (MALDI) mass spectrometry to profile and map proteins present in tissue sections. The goal of this study is to identify differentially expressed proteins that can ultimately be used as biomarkers for MS. Methods: Myelin basic protein (MBP)-immunized Lewis rats were sacrificed and brain extracts were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-GE) and 2D liquid chromatography (2D-LC), both combined with tandem mass spectrometry. For MSI, cryostat coronal sections of 10 \u03bcm were cut, transferred to a stainless steel MALDI target plate and sprayed with matrix. Spectra of 4-25 kDa were acquired using a Bruker Ultraflex II MALDI-TOF/TOF instrument. Results and perspectives: The application of 2D-GE and 2D-LC resulted in the identification of >200 proteins, some of which were found differentially expressed in the brain of EAE animals. Ongoing MSI experiments include the monitoring of selected brain proteins with experimentally determined masses such as myelin basic protein. Future experiments will focus on the identification of differentially distributed proteins in acute EAE as well as in a demyelinating animal model. Differentially expressed proteins found in either proteomic application will be validated for their use as biomarkers in MS.",

To investigate this possibility we actively immunized mice with tau protein and tested whether a neurodegenerative disease is induced. Methods: We immunized C57BL mice with recombinant human tau protein with complete Freund's-adjuvant (CFA) and pertussis. Results: Out of 11 female animals immunized with tau 6 developed neurological signs such as limp tail and limb paralysis, whereas none of the CFA-immunized controls showed any symptoms. In all of the tauimmunized mice we have detected anti-tau Abs in serum, and glial activation as well as tau-related pathology in the spinal cord (and to a lesser extent also in brains). These findings were much more prominent in the clinically affected animals. Mononuclear infiltrates and axonal damage were detected only in the clinically affected tau-immunized animals. Conclusion: We demonstrated a neurodegenerative disease induced by immunization with the tau protein. To our best knowledge this is the first report indicating that tau protein has an immunogenic potential, and can induce neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. These findings may shed light on the possible involvement of tau autoimmunity in neurodegenerative diseases, and point to the potential danger of therapeutic immunization with tau protein.",

To investigate the neuronal response to axonal injury in the context of inflammatory demyelination we have developed a model of relapsing remitting MOGinduced EAE in the Lewis rat characterised by a predictable and focal development of lesions in the cervical spinal cord and cerebellum. Disease is induced by immunisation with refolded recombinant rat MOG in incomplete Freunds adjuvant (IFA) which unlike classical models of disease is characterised by circling and ataxia. Disease course and pathology has now been assessed during the initial episode of disease, relapse and remission. Typically 2 or 3 distinct relapses are observed over a period of 70 days post immunisation with lesions appearing to preferentially target the dorsal column of the cervical spinal cord at early time points with subsequent involvement of cerebellar region of the brain. Inflammation was associated with confluent demyelination and axonal injury. The mechanisms responsible for the selective targeting of specific regions of the CNS are unclear. Preliminary studies indicate local differences in the recruitment and activation of a minimal encephalitogenic T cell response that is amplified by the high titre demyelinating antibody response induced by refolded MOG. This model of EAE will be useful for studying regional differences in the response of the blood brain barrier, axons and defined neuronal cell populations to inflammatory demyelination during relapsing remitting disease.",

Inherited susceptibility to autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and IDDM are associated with particular MHC class II alleles. Advent of HLA transgenic mice has helped us in deciphering role of particular HLA DR and DQ class II molecules in human autoimmune diseases. In mouse, the expression of class II is restricted to professional antigen presenting cells. However in human, class II is also expressed on T cells unlike mouse T cells. We have generated a 'new' humanized HLA class II transgenic mice expressing class II molecules on a subset of CD4 T cells. The expression of class II on CD4 + T cells is inducible and classII + CD4 + T cells can present antigen in the absence of APCs. Further, using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a well-established animal model of multiple sclerosis, we tested the functional significance of these classII + CD4 + T cells. DR3.AEo transgenic mice were susceptible to PLP91-110 induced EAE and showed CNS pathology accompanied by widespread inflammation and demyelination seen in human MS patients suggesting a role for class II + CD4 + T cells in the pathogenesis. Dendritic cells (DC) are professional antigen presenting cells that actively initiate adaptive immune responses or control peripheral tolerance to self-antigens. We have demonstrated that in particular signals provided by antigens that target C-type lectin receptors (CLR) function as uptake receptors for glycosylated antigens to maintain homeostasis and induce tolerance. Concomitant DC maturation induced through Toll-like receptors (TLR) triggering are instrumental in inducing auto-immunity.",

Binding of the S1P-mimick FTY720-P to S1P1-Rs on T-cells causes receptor internalization which in turn prevents the trafficking of T-cells to the blood and CNS. This reduces the accumulation of harmful T-cells in the CNS of Multiple Sclerosis patients and phase II studies with FTY720 have clearly shown protective effects in Multiple Sclerosis. Intriguingly, the five S1P-Rs are also differentially expressed on the four major cell types of the brain, namely Neurons, Oligodendrocytes, Astrocytes, and Microglia. Little is known about the role of S1P-Rs in the brain, but studies using S1P and activation of S1P-Rs indicate that these receptors may modulate all four cell types. FTY720 readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. We therefore suggest that FTY720 works beyond the immune system and plays additional protective roles on CNS cells in Multiple Sclerosis.

A recent study showed that myelin-reactive T cells in MS patients are primarily high-avidity T cells specific for low-affinity MHC-binding epitopes. We found that the low-affinity binding MBP 115-126 peptide is a dominant epitope in HLA-DR4 transgenic mice.

We have therefore investigated whether superagonist peptides can be designed for MBP 115-126 for the treatment of MS.

To evaluate the efficacy of epicutaneous (e.c.) tolerance induction in the prevention of CNS autoimmunity, we utilized an animal model of multiple sclerosis: experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced by immunization with myelin basic protein (MBP). We show that application of MBP to the skin prior to the induction of EAE protected mice from developing disease. In addition, e.c. application of MBP at the first signs of EAE, also resulted in suppression of disease. This therapeutic effect was transferable to na\u00efve recipients with lymph node cells from mice treated epicutaneously. These tolerogenic regulatory cells were found to be antigen non-specific, as suppression of EAE also occurred when the antigens such as OVA or TNP were applied e.c. Skin-induced regulatory cells belong to the population of TCR\u03b1\u03b2 + CD4 + CD8 + lymphocytes. The mechanistic basis for the tolerance was found to be the production of TGF-\u03b2 by this cells population. These data demonstrate that e.c.-induced regulatory T cells are potent inhibitors of antigen-specific T cell responses, and suggest that e.c. tolerization may have potential effectiveness in the treatment of autoimmune disorders. Recombinant, two domain major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules consisting of the peptide binding (\u03b11\u03b21) domains of MHC Class II have potent therapeutic activity in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Following i.v. injection, the \u03b11\u03b21 MHCs were only detectable in the serum and plasma of mice for 15-30 min. This short half-life suggested that cellular adherence was responsible for removing \u03b11\u03b21 MHCs from peripheral blood, and indeed, we found that they adhered preferentially to the cell surface of B cells among murine peripheral blood (PB) and spleen (SP) cells. But neither full length (four domain) recombinant MHC Class II molecules nor MHC Class II tetramers had any detectable affinity for PB or SP cells. The FACS detectable level of \u03b11\u03b21 MHC on the surface of B cells decreased after 1 h of incubation; however, Alexa-488 labeled \u03b11\u03b21 MHCs continued to fluoresce from B cells after overnight incubation indicating that the \u03b11\u03b21 MHC was endocytosed.

Consistent with this view, injection of neonatal mice with neuroantigens induces Th2 immunity and protects from induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In this study we asked whether neuroantigen-specific Th1 immunity could be induced in neonatal mice, and what the outcome would be for autoimmune disease. Methods: Neonatal SJL and B10.PL mice were injected with myelin antigens in CFA and cytokine profiles of the induced T cell responses were measured by ELISPOT assay. Neonatally injected animals were observed for EAE, or the mice were re-injected with myelin antigens as adults to determine protection from EAE. Results: The results show that injection of neonatal SJL and B10.PL mice with PLP139-151 or MBPAc1-11 in CFA resulted in vigorous antigenspecific production of proinflammatory cytokines, including IFN-g and IL-17, but not Th2 cytokines, such as IL-5. Importantly, the neonatally injected mice did not develop EAE, despite the abundant neuroantigen-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines, and were protected from induction of the disease upon reinjection with neuroantigen as adults. Conclusions: The data show that a developmental window exists during the neonatal period in which proinflammatory autoreactive T cells that are not pathogenic can be induced. The data suggest that this could be due to a tissue-specific decrease in the propensity to differentiate towards encephalitogenic \"T H -17\" cells. The results may provide a rationale for the persistence of autoreactive T cells in healthy individuals in the absence of autoimmune pathology.",

Background: B-cells and myelin-specific antibodies (Ab) both play a pathogenic role in CNS autoimmune disease. Recent studies indicate that B cells may also have a regulatory function. We evaluated anti-CD20 mediated B-cell depletion in EAE induced either by MOG p35-55 or by recombinant mouse MOG 1-125 (rMOG). Methods: EAE was induced in human CD20-transgenic C57BL/6 mice in which anti-hCD20-Ab (m2h7) depletes B-cells. For EAE-prevention, mice received weekly i.p. injections of m2h7 or IgG2a-isotype starting 21 days prior to immunization. In reversal-experiments mice were randomized to treatment at onset of paralysis. T cell proliferation, cytokine and Ab production to MOG p35-55 or rMOG as well as histopathological examination was performed in all mice. Results: Anti-CD20 mediated B-cell depletion had beneficial effects in EAE prevention and reversed paralysis in rMOG-induced EAE. B-cell depleted mice revealed decreased titers for anti-rMOG Ab. In contrast, B-cell depletion prior to immunization exacerbated MOG p35-55-induced EAE with enhanced CNS-infiltration and demyelination and a decreased number of infiltrating B-cells. Splenic MOG 35-55 specific responses were shifted towards a proinflammatory Th1-phenotype with a pronounced decrease in IL-10 production. Conclusion: Anti-CD20 B-cell depletion has differential effects on MOGprotein and MOG-peptide induced autoimmune encephalomyelitis. The beneficial effect of anti-CD20 B-cell depletion in rMOG-induced EAE may reflect a decrease in antigen presentation and/or reduced titers for myelinspecific Ab, whereas exacerbation of MOG peptide-induced EAE may relate to a reduction in B-cell regulation.",

Racke \u204e + Department of Neurology \u204e and Center for Immunology + , University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptors (PPARs) are ligandactivated transcription factors belonging to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. Rencently, PPARs have been shown to be expressed in macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, and B cells and play a role in the inflammatory response. Our group has previously shown that the PPAR\u03b1 agonists gemfibrozil and fenofibrate can ameliorate Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), by inhibiting IFN\u03b3 and promoting IL-4 production. The current study further characterizes the ability of PPAR\u03b1 agonists to induce immune deviation and regulate inflammation in EAE. We found that splenocytes treated with gemfibrozil have altered PPAR\u03b1, GATA3 and T-bet expression. Using an siRNA specific for PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b1 and GATA3 levels were reduced. In vivo administration of siRNA-Ppar\u03b1 inhibited the ability of gemfibrozil to ameliorate EAE and prevented IL-4 and IL-5 secretion, suggesting that the agonist is mediating its effects in a receptor-dependent manner. PPAR\u03b1 was found to directly bind the regulatory regions of the IL-4 and IL-5 genes by chromatin immunoprecipitation and IL-4-deficient mice were more suspectible to EAE, even following gemfibrozil treatment. IL-4deficient mice expressed lower levels of PPAR\u03b1 than controls and T-bet, GATA3, and SRC-1 expression were also found to be altered in gemfibroziltreated mice. Finally, treatment of EAE mice with gemfibrozil and fenofibrate ameliorated disease course significantly. This data suggests that PPAR\u03b1 agonists mediate their anti-inflammatory effects in an IL-4 and receptor-dependent manner and could potentially be used as a treatment for immune-mediated diseases such as MS.",

We recently showed that bifunctional compounds comprising nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (ibuprofen) and cholinergic up-regulation (AChE inhibitor, AChEI; pyridostigmine) moieties ameliorate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The presence of cholinergic upregulation moiety increased the anti-inflammatory effect. Consequently, we studied anti-inflammatory effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI) in CNS inflammation in vivo and in vitro. AChEI suppressed lymphocyte proliferation, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and extracellular esterase activity. Anti-inflammatory activity was mediated by the alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (neuronal type), the muscarinic receptor had the opposite effect. Treatment of EAE with EN101, an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide, targeted to AChE mRNA, and with conventional AChEI, reduced disease severity and CNS inflammation. Our experimental results suggest that AChEI increases the concentration of extracellular acetylcholine (ACh), rendering it available for interaction with a nicotinic receptor expressed on lymphocytes. These observations point to a novel role for AChEI which may be relevant in CNS inflammatory diseases such as EAE and Multiple Sclerosis. They also emphasize the importance of cholinergic balance in neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and Myasthenia Gravis, in which these drugs are used.",

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a T cell-mediated auto-immune disease of the CNS that leads to demyelination, axonal damage, and neuronal loss. The pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for development of MS and its animal model EAE are not well defined; however, increased expression/ activation of the calcium-activated neural protease calpain may play a role. Thus, we hypothesize that treatment with a calpain inhibitor will attenuate immune cell infiltration and neurodegeneration in EAE spinal cord. To test the hypothesis, EAE was induced in male Lewis and on days 4 and 8 post-EAE induction, control and EAE rats were treated with the calpain inhibitor SJA6017 (SJA, 3 mg/kg) or vehicle (DMSO). On day 11 post-EAE induction, animals were sacrificed and lumbar spinal cord segments were collected for immunohistolabeling of cell-specific calpain expression (antimcalapin antibody). Calpain was markedly increased in OX42 + (macrophage/microglia) and IFN\u03b3 + (T cell) cells in EAE animals, as compared to controls. Since very few cells tested positive for OX42 in control tissue, we suspect that these cells are mainly infiltrating macrophages, with some resident microglia. Treatment with SJA blocked calpain expression and migration of OX-42 + and IFN\u03b3 + cells into the CNS. Neuron (NeuN)-specific calpain expression, neuronal death (TUNEL) and axonal damage (de-NFP) were also upregulated in acute EAE spinal cord. Treatment with SJA blocked most neuronal calpain expression, neuronal death, and axonal damage, as compared to vehicle-treated EAE rats. These data suggest that calpain inhibition will attenuate immune cell infiltration and neurodegeneration during EAE and may offer potential therapeutic benefits for MS patients. Constitutively expressed HSP90 forms complexes with transcription factor HSF1, and with other client proteins. HSP90 inhibitors promote HSF1 dissociation which induces a heat shock response (HSR), whereas upon dissociation most client proteins are degraded (CPD), including kinase AKT/PKB which is involved in T-cell activation. We showed that clinical symptoms in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) are reduced by geldanamycin, a naturally occurring HSP90 inhibitor; however whether this involved HSR or CPD was not addressed. We now characterize the effects of novel HSP90 inhibitors on glial and T-cell activation, clinical and histological signs in EAE, and AKT activation. Screening of synthetic HSP90 inhibitors identified several with high (low nM) efficacy to inhibit astrocyte NOS2 and IL1b expression, and T-cell IFNg production. EC72, a geldanamycin derivative, reduced clinical signs of MOG-EAE when given early in disease, and induced recovery when administered to ill mice. Late administration of EC72 also reduced subsequent axonal damage. In vivo treatment with EC72 did not reduce T-cell activation, nor did EC72 inhibit reactivation of primed T-cells in vitro. However, EC72 and other HSP90 inhibitors reduced CD3:CD28 dependent activation of na\u00efve T-cells, which was also reduced by the AKT inhibitor SH5. HSP90 inhibitors induced AKT degradation, and their effects were lessened in cells expressing constitutively active myrAKT. HSP90 inhibitors could block NOS2 induction in HSF1 null cells. These results demonstrate efficacy of novel HSP90 inhibitors in EAE, and suggest that induction of a HSR is not critical for their effects. Supported in part by a grant from Conforma Therapeutics. Inflammation-induced oxidative stress can lead to axonal degeneration, which is felt to be a major determinant of progressive neurological disability in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Water-soluble derivatives of fullerenes are a unique class of allotropic form of carbon compounds with potent antioxidant properties. 10 week old mice were immunized with 150 \u03bcg of MOG 35-55 peptide in CFA followed by pertussis toxin. Disease is characterized by an attack followed by a progressive phase with chronic clinical impairment. Following the first attack, animals were distributed into different groups with similar disease courses and treated intraperitoneally either with 200 \u03bcl of a 1 \u03bcM fullerene solution or vehicle (DMSO 2% in PBS) every day until termination of the experiment on day 63. We tested three different fullerene derivatives (ABS-75, ABS-16, and the C60 fullerene core) and found that ABS-75 treatment initiated after disease onset reduced the clinical progression of chronic EAE in NOD mice (treated vs. control, p < 0.05). Fullerene ABS-75 consists of a C60 carbon fullerene core to which a known NMDA receptor ligand was attached. ABS-75 treatment also reduced axonal loss and demyelination (as evaluated by silver and Luxol fast blue staining, respectively) in the white matter of mice. ABS-75 treated animals also showed reduction in CD11b + infiltration and astrogliosis as compared to vehicle-treated group. Our data demonstrate a neuroprotective effect of a treatment with a fullerene compound combined with a NMDA receptor ligand that may have applicability in the treatment of progressive MS and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

Its mechanism of action involves blocking binding of lymphocyte-expressed \u03b14\u03b21 and endothelial VCAM-1, thereby inhibiting extravasation of leukocytes into the central nervous system. Natalizumab is cross-reactive for guinea pig \u03b14\u03b21, and can be dosed long-term (>30 days) in guinea pigs without apparent ill-effect or loss of potency. Groups of 15 early chronic stage EAE-afflicted guinea pigs (15 days post-induction, as chronic progression is beginning) were treated subcutaneously every other day for 56 d with 30 mg/kg natalizumab or vehicle. Natalizumab induced peripheral blood lymphocytosis in EAE animals (mean elevation = 4-fold on d28 and 3.5-fold on d56 relative to vehicle EAE animals). Natalizumab induced an immediate reversal in clinical scores, enhanced body weight gain and reduced mortality relative to vehicle, and maintained significant clinical protection throughout completion of the study. Mean paralytic clinical scores of natalizumab-treated animals on d28 and d56 were 0.86 and 0.4 respectively, compared to vehicle EAE clinical scores of 2.23 and 2.62 for d28 and d56. Clinical improvement in natalizumab-treated guinea pigs was paralleled histologically in spinal cord sections. The percentage of lesioned area in white matter was lower in natalizumab-treated animals than in vehicle EAE animals.

Histopathological examinations of the spinal cord of sFcR treated mice in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis revealed a decreased amount of infiltrated cells and especially reduced numbers of activated macrophages. Furthermore treatment resulted in decreased demyelinated plaques and axonal damage. Mice receiving the soluble receptor also showed lower levels of pathogenic antibodies and less activated B-cells. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a major chronic autoimmune pathology of the central nervous system. Members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) family are known to be important factors involved at key steps of MS, however little is known of the role of MMP12 in MS. To determine the extent to which MMP12 might be involved in this pathology, we administered orally a MMP12 inhibitor in preventive regimen (3, 10, 30 mg/kg) in the MOG-induced chronic mice as well as in curative regimen (1.5, 5, 15, 30 mg/kg) in the whole spinal cord protractedremitting rat experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) models which are animal models mimicking various aspects of MS. In preventive treatment, the MMP12 inhibitor significantly delayed the disease onset and decreased the severity of the clinical signs over the course of the pathology suggesting the involvement of MMP12 in the induction as well as the following effector phase of the pathology. In the protracted-remitting EAE model, a mixed model of inflammation and early demyelination, oral administration starting at clinical score 1 decreased the severity of the first attack and the following remitting phases at a minimal dose of 5 mg/kg. This effect was paralleled by an elimination of inflammatory infiltrates, demyelination and axonal damage in the spinal cords of treated animals. These results support the potential role of MMP12 in the development of MS-like conditions and strengthen previous findings on MMP12 in MS patients (Vos et al., 2003) . The aim of this study was to examine the effect of TLR4 stimulation in EAE, an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Upon recognition of bacterial LPS, TLR4 signaling induces the expression of a range of proand anti-inflammatory mediators. The role of TLR4 in autoimmunity is not well characterized. We induced chronic EAE in female C57BL/6 mice by subcutaneous immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG35-55) in CFA and intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of pertussis toxin on days 0 and 2. Mice received LPS (25 \u03bcg/day) or PBS i.p. on days 0-5 and were sacrificed at various timepoints. Spleen cells were cultured with or without antigen and assessed for proliferation. Culture supernatants were assayed for cytokine levels by cytometric bead arrays and ELISA. Spinal cord cellular infiltration was characterized by flow cytometry. EAE onset was significantly delayed in LPS treated mice compared to PBS treated groups. Regardless of antigenic stimulus in vitro, the monocyte/macrophage chemoattractant, MCP-1 (CCL2), was elevated in splenocyte culture supernatants of LPS treated mice compared to PBS controls at day 19 post immunization (p.i.). Despite significantly greater T cell proliferation in LPS treated mice at day 6 p.i., there was lower inflammatory infiltration of the spinal cord of these mice at day 19 p.i. compared to PBS treated mice. We conclude that stimulation of TLR4 delays the onset of chronic EAE by mechanisms which include inhibition of lympho-mononuclear cell infiltration into the CNS. This may be due to enhanced chemotactic activity of CCL-2 in the peripheral immune system.",

Numerous studies have proved the correlation between the coagulation-fibrinolysis system and the pathogenesis of EAE. We have examined the role of coagulation system in EAE by using argatroban, which is a direct inhibitor of thrombin. Argatroban treatment significantly suppressed clinical manifestations of EAE in Lewis rats; the mean cumulative clinical score for argatroban treated rats was 5.0, while saline treated controls scored 9.1 (P < .01). Plasma thrombinantithrombin \u00d8 complex (TAT) values were significantly lower in argatroban treated rats compared with saline-treated controls (p < 0.01). Immunohistologically, perivascular fibrin depositions were reduced in lumbosacrococcygeal spinal cord of guinea-pig myelin basic protein (GPMBP)-sensitized rats treated with argatroban. RT-PCR revealed that the cytokine levels was reduced within spinal cord of argatroban treated rats compared with control rats, showing cell migration is suppressed by inhibition of fibrin deposition. These results suggest that the activation of coagulation cascade is an important role for development of EAE. Furthermore, our data suggest that fibrin could be a potential therapeutic target in MS. Anticoagulation therapies aiming selectively inhibit the fibrin deposition might be a safer approach than the exogenous administration derived from organisms.",

Sakoda Department of Neurology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan Vitamin K 2 (VK2) has been widely used for the management of osteoporosis in Japan. It was demonstrated that HMG-coA reductase inhibitors (statins) have beneficial effects on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and the inhibition of geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate (GGPP) synthesis plays a key role in the effects. Since the side chain of VK2 has a common structure to geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate (GGPP), it could be expected that VK2 has similar effects as seen in statins. Lewis rats were actively immunized with myelin basic protein (MBP). Each rats received intraperitoneal administration of VK2 and clinical scores were evaluated daily. Histological, immunohistochemical, and Western blot analyses of the spinal cords and cultured glial cells were also performed. The clinical severity of EAE was significantly ameliorated by the prophylactic administration of VK2. Histological analysis revealed that inflammatory cellular infiltration was significantly reduced in the spinal cords of VK2treated rats. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses revealed that the expression of both MHC class II and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were significantly reduced in the spinal cords of VK2-treated rats with EAE. The inhibitory effect of VK2 on the iNOS expression in glial cells was also observed in vitro. Considering the wide use of VK2 without noticeable untoward effects, it may be applicable to the patients with MS. Background: The TNF-related weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) mediates proinflammatory effects by its receptor fibroblast-growth-factorinducible-14 (Fn14). We previously showed that TWEAK/Fn14-interactions contribute to lesion development in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and that neutralisation of TWEAK or Fn14 ameliorates CNS inflammation in EAE. TWEAK also increased CCL2 release by CNS resident cells.",

Available therapies mainly target the inflammatory component of the disease but fail to prevent neurodegeneration. To investigate the effect of minocycline on the survival of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the neurons that form the axons of the optic nerve, we used a rat model of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Optic neuritis in this model was diagnosed by recording visual evoked potentials and RGC function was monitored by measuring electroretinograms. Functional and histopathological data of RGCs and optic nerves revealed neuronal and axonal protection when minocycline treatment was started on the day of immunization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that minocycline-induced neuroprotection is related to a direct antagonism of multiple mechanisms leading to neuronal cell death such as the induction of anti-apoptotic intracellular signalling pathways and a decrease in glutamate excitotoxicity. From these observations, we conclude that minocycline exerts neuroprotective effects independent of its anti-inflammatory properties. This hypothesis was confirmed in a non-inflammatory disease model leading to degeneration of RGCs, the surgical transection of the optic nerve.",

Real-time PCR data suggest a correlation between myelin gene expression in the CNS and the distinct phases of relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (R-EAE). Compared to preclinical stages, we have observed decreased myelin gene expression during acute disease and first relapse and increased Notch signaling molecule expression during R-EAE. Notch inhibits oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination during development and has been hypothesized as a limiting factor for remyelination. We have designed a treatment strategy for ongoing EAE that combines \u03b3-secretase inhibition (which blocks Notch signaling in addition to a host of other factors) and anti-CD80(Fab), a wellestablished immunoregulatory strategy. We are additionally designing and testing other myelin repair strategies in combination with immunoregulatory techniques.

Here we asked whether inhibition of monocyte migration in vivo by use of anti-CD81 antibodies would have a beneficial effect on neurological symptoms in experimental autoimmune encephalitis. Mice were immunized with PLP139-151 and treated with two different hamster anti-mouse CD81 antibodies, isotype control mAb or vehicle (n = 10 per group). Antibodies were injected i.p. at 100 \u03bcg per injection every other day for 3 weeks starting 5 days post immunisation.

Interestingly, treatment with the other anti-CD81 mAb 2F7 had no effect on clinical scores, whereas an irrelevant mAb resulted in intermediate scores.

NK cells were isolated from the spleen of non-immunized B6 mice, activated in vitro with IL-2, and were inoculated intravenously into MOG-sensitized mice on the indicated days. Results: At first, we studied whether NK cells are infiltrated within lesions of the central nervous system (CNS) of EAE mice.

The intravenous injection of in vitro IL-2-activated NK cells (NK-LAK cells) into MOGsensitized mice on Days 7, 14 and 21 after sensitization clearly suppressed clinical severity of EAE.

This resistance was closely associated with substantial expansion of Treg cells in peripheral lymph nodes after MOG immunization as compared with those in wild mice. Administration of MK to MK deficient mice significantly abrogated the resistance of EAE and suppressed the expansion of Treg cells in vivo and in vitro. In addition, the frequency of autoreactive Th1 cells decreased without affecting Th2 population. These results indicate that MK deficiency results in expansion of Treg cells in periphery and control the activation of autoreactive Th1. This is the first demonstration that MK deficiency plays a critical immunomodulatory role in the development of EAE.

Moreover, factors produced by activated RPE enhanced IRBP-CD4 but inhibited CD8 T cell activation and the factors produced by activated astrocytes inhibited both T cells. Our results suggest that (1) both RPE and astrocytes have regulatory effects on activation of T cells in the eye. At least, a part of the regulatory effect is mediated by the factors they produce, (2) : different parenchymal cells of the eye may have distinct regulatory effects on CD4 and CD8 autoreactive T cell. Therefore, studies on the mechanism by which parenchymal cells of the eye regulate the invading autoreactive T cells should provide needed information for therapeutic intervention. Estrogen (E2)-induced immunomodulation involves dual effects on antigen presenting cells (APC) and CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cells (Treg), but not a direct effect on effector T cells. In this report, we further investigated the effects of E2 on APC and Treg cell function. We found that E2 treatment in vivo strongly reduced recovery of APC from the peritoneal cavity and inhibited their ability to induce inflammatory cytokines, IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3, but enhanced secretion of IL-10. Moreover, E2 conditioned bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BM-DC) could both enhance Treg cell activity and directly inhibit responder T cells in the absence of Treg cells. We examined whether this E2-induced inhibitory activity of BM-DC might involve co-stimulation through the recently described PD-1 pathway. Both E2 and pregnancy markedly enhanced PD-1 expression in several types of APC, including macrophages, B cells, and especially dendritic cells (DC). Similar to E2-induced enhancement of FoxP3 expression and EAE protection, E2-induced enhancement of PD-1 + cells was also mediated through estrogen receptor alpha (Esr1) in DC and macrophages, but not B cells. Based on antibody inhibition studies, PD-1 interaction with its ligands, PDL-1 and especially PDL-2, could mediate either positive or negative regulatory signaling in both mature and immature E2-conditioned DC, depending respectively on a relatively high (10:1) or low (1:1) ratio of T cells:BM-DC. These novel findings indicate that E2-induced immunomodulation is mediated in part through potentiation in BM-DC of the PD-1 costimulatory pathway.",

By using polyclonal antibodies to mu-opioid receptors and FACS analysis we have recently reported membrane expression of MOR on a sub-population of HL-60 cells (1) . Extending that study we have examined transcriptional expression of MOR by using RT-PCR. The functionality of MOR expressed on HL-60 cells was examined by measuring Ca + mobilisation triggered by selective MOR agonists. Morphine and endomorphin-2 were used as representative agonists with alkaloid or peptide structure, respectively. Presence of mRNA for MOR was detected in HL-60 cells, which corresponded to that in a neuronal cell line SH-SY5Y. Both morphine and endomorphin-2 triggered Ca + mobilisation in HL-60 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Endomorphin-2-induced Ca + mobilisation was reduced by selective MOR antagonist betafunaltrexamine suggesting a MOR-mediated action.

PP08-03 Crosstalk between chemokine, opioid, and vanilloid receptors Chemokine receptors serve as a bridge between the immune and neural systems. Neuropeptides, such as opioids, inhibit chemokine receptor function on leukocytes by activating Gi protein and calcium-independent protein kinase C. Conversely, during inflammation, chemokines similarly regulate neuronal sensing in two ways. Activation of chemokine receptors on neurons desensitizes the analgesic \u03bc-opioid receptor and concomitantly enhances the sensitivity of a pain receptor, TRPV1, via protein kinase Cdependent phosphorylation, resulting in hyperalgesic effects. We will present the cellular, biochemical, and in vivo evidence to show that receptor cross-talk provides an important pathway for neuroimmune interactions.",

Cytokines can modulate the function of the HPA axis. Interferon-alpha (IFN\u03b1) also has this effect, but the mechanisms are not thoroughly characterized, and the results remain controversial and conflict. This study is to explore the molecular structure basis and receptor mechanisms of IFN\u03b1 upon the HPA axis in vivo and vitro. Two kinds of IFN\u03b1 mutants were obtained and used, which are 129Ser-IFN\u03b1 with analgesic activity and 38Leu-IFN\u03b1 with antiviral activity. After administration of IFN\u03b1 and its mutants to ventricle in vivo and to cultured hypothalamic slices, AtT20 cells, and adrenal cortical slices, the contents of CRH, ACTH, and corticosterone in samples were assayed respectively. The results showed that Wild-IFN\u03b1 and 129Ser-IFN\u03b1 could decrease CRH, ACTH and corticosterone contents in vivo, and decrease CRH content, stimulate corticosterone secretion in vitro significantly, which could be blocked by opioid receptor antagonist naloxone pretreated. 129S-IFN\u03b1 had no direct effects on ACTH secretion in AtT20 cells without \u03bc opioid receptor expression. 38L-IFN\u03b1 also had similar effects in vivo and vitro, but with less potency and insensitive to naloxone. It is the first highly suggested that IFN\u03b1 maybe regulate the HPA axis at least by two different receptor mechanisms: one is opioid receptors and the molecular structure basis is opioid domain of IFN\u03b1.

Neuropeptides may directly or indirectly modulate glial functions in the central nervous system (CNS). In the current study, effects of various neuropeptides on the viability and inflammatory activation of cultured microglia have been investigated. While vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P, cholecystokinin, or neuropeptide Y did not affect microglial cell viability, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) induced a classical apoptosis of mouse microglia in culture as evidenced by nuclear condensation and fragmentation, TUNEL staining, and cleavage of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) protein. CRH, however, did not influence nitric oxide production (assessed by Griess reaction) or inflammatory gene expression (assessed by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis) including cytokines and chemokines, indicating that CRH did not affect the inflammatory activation of microglia. The CRH-induced microglial apoptosis appeared to involve a mitochondrial pathway and reactive oxygen species based on mitochondrial membrane potential change, caspase-9 activation, and the sensitivity to antioxidants. Taken together, our results indicate that the stress neuropeptide CRH may regulate neuroinflammation by inducing the apoptosis of microglia, the major cellular source of inflammatory mediators in CNS.

Stimulation of mAChRs on T and B cells causes oscillating intracellular Ca 2+ signaling and up-regulates c-fos gene expression. Stimulation of nAChRs produces rapid and transient intracellular Ca 2+ signaling. We investigated the gene expression of cholinergic components in splenic mononuclear cells (MNLs), bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), and macrophages of C57BL/6J mice. In resting condition, ChAT gene expression was detected only in the brain by RT-PCR, while AChE gene expression was observed in all samples. After ConA or LPS stimulation, ChAT gene expression was detected in MNLs and BMDCs, respectively, suggesting that immunological stimulation induces ACh synthesis. Genes for M 1 -M 5 mAChRs were expressed in all samples. Genes for the \u03b12, \u03b15, \u03b16, \u03b17, \u03b110, and \u03b22 subunits of the nAChR were expressed in all samples, while no expression was detected for the genes for \u03b13 and \u03b23. \u03b14, \u03b19, and \u03b25 gene expressions varied among the samples. The gene for SLURP-1, a recently discovered endogenous peptide allosteric ligand of \u03b17 nAChR, was expressed in all samples. These results suggest that ACh and SLURP-1 play intermediary roles in the dialogue among lymphocytes, BMDCs, and macrophages during immune responses via mAChR-and nAChRmediated pathways in autocrine and/or paracrine fashion, via contact with each other through cell surface molecules such as ICAM-1/LFA and CD4/MHC-II. Evidence suggests that inflammation is a significant contributor to pathology in a number of neurodegenerative disease states. In this regard, the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) plays a key role in initiating an immune response within the central nervous system (CNS). The actions of IL-1\u03b2 can be regulated in vivo by interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra); a molecule that prevents IL-1\u03b2 from acting on the IL-1type I receptor. Consequently, the balance between IL-1ra/IL-1 \u03b2 is of pathological importance, and pharmacological strategies that tip the balance in favour of IL-1ra may be of therapeutic benefit. Evidence is emerging to suggest that the neurotransmitter noradrenaline elicits anti-inflammatory actions in the CNS, and consequently may play an endogenous neuroprotective role. In this study we report that noradrenaline induces production of secreted IL-1ra from primary rat mixed glial cells, without altering IL-1\u03b2 concentrations. Noradrenaline-induced IL-1ra production was attenuated by the non-selective \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol, and also by the selective \u03b2 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist butoxamine, but not by the selective \u03b2 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol. Furthermore, the selective \u03b2 2 -adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol mimicked the ability of noradrenaline to increase IL-1ra production. Taken together these data indicate that the \u03b2 2 -adrenoceptor mediates the ability of noradrenaline to increase IL-1ra production. Consistent with the ability of \u03b2-adrenoceptors to activate the cAMP-protein kinase A pathway, the stable cAMP analog dibutryl cAMP mimicked, and the PKA antagonist RP-cAMPs blocked the ability of noradrenaline to increase IL-1ra. Overall, these data further demonstrate that noradrenaline is a neurotransmitter with anti-inflammatory and therefore potential neuroprotective actions within the CNS.",

Chronic exposure to nicotine causes immunosuppression and impairs T cell function. When given intracerebroventricularly (ICV), relatively small concentrations of nicotine affect T cell responses, and these effects are not significantly influenced by adrenalectomy, indicating that the HPA axis does not play a major role in the nicotine-induced immunosuppression. However, the immunosuppression is blocked by ganglionic blockers, indicating that under these conditions the effects of nicotine are regulated by the sympathetic autonomic nervous system (sANS). Peripheral administration of nicotine at concentrations seen in smokers, also suppresses the immune system, and the suppression is only partially attenuated by ganglionic blockers. Indeed, T cells express \u03b17-nAChRs; however, in spite of near total homology with the neuronal \u03b17-nAChR, the T cell \u03b17-nAChRs do not form detectable levels of ligand-gated Ca 2+ channels and operate essentially through second messengers. In T cells, nicotine modulates two distinct signaling pathways: 1. Nicotine increase [Ca 2+ ] i through the Src-like protein tyrosine kinase, Lck that requires the functional integrity of the T cell receptor. 2. Nicotine affects NF\u03baB activation through ERK that is independent of TCR. Thus nicotine modulates T cell and inflammatory responses through the sympathetic autonomic nervous system as well as via direct interaction with a unique \u03b17-nAChR. Thus, nicotine controls the adaptive and inflammatory responses through sans and direct interaction with T cells via two distinct signaling pathways.

Both factors commonly induce the growth and differentiation of monocytic lineage cells from the peritoneal, bone marrow, thymus and brain. Colonies induced by the two factors were different in morphology in an early stage of culture, but showed monocytic cell characteristics in the terminal stage. Immunohistochemical studies indicated that major producers of the two factors were neural cells in the brain and myoid cells in the thymus, suggesting their biological roles other than monocytic cell stimulatory activity. To examine biological roles, such as immunological and neurological roles, we purified those factors from the brain cells, cultured myoid cells and hyperplastic thymus in which many precursor myoid cells were detected, and tested their immunological and neuro-stimulatory roles. We found that those two factors sustain neuronal growth and stimulate microglial cell growth. Furthermore, the factors stimulate B-cell responses in a synergic fashion with IL-2, without the aid of other T-cell factors such as IL-4 or T-cells themselves and induce immunoglobulin class switches. Those factors also appeared to stimulate T-cells to produce B-cell activating cytokines, leading to B-cell proliferation. These results suggest that the two new haemopoietic factors play important roles not only in monocytic-microglial cell diversification but also in brain physiology and many immunological events. The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) is produced both in the periphery and the brain in response to various immune challenges, including autoimmune diseases, as well as following exposure to psychological stressors. Since in humans autoimmune diseases and chronic stress are important risk factors for the development of major depression, and because our previous work implicated IL-1 in behavioral suppression following acute challenges, we sought to examine the role of this cytokine in mediating the depressive-like symptoms induced during episodes of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) as we well as following exposure to chronic mild stress (CMS), an established model of depression in rodents. We first demonstrated a temporal correlation between the elevation in brain IL-1 and the development of depressive-like symptoms during EAE and CMS exposure. Using mice with deletion of the IL-1 type I receptor or transgenic over-expression of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) in the brain, as well as pharmacological administration of IL-1ra, we demonstrated that the depressive-like effects exhibited by mice with EAE or following exposure to CMS were completely abolished by blockade of IL-1 signaling. Furthermore, we showed that the behavioral effects of CMSinduced elevation of IL-1 are mediated both by adrenocortical activation and via suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis. Finally, chronic administration of IL-1 via osmotic minipumps mimicked the depressive-like behavioral effects of EAE and CMS, and also produced adrenocortical activation and reduced hippocampal neurogenesis. These findings indicate that IL-1 is both necessary and sufficient for the depression associated with autoimmune and chronic stress conditions.",

            "text": "Neural correlates of IgE-mediated allergy Although many authors had considered a direct interaction between allergic reactions and behavioral changes, supporting evidence had been elusive. In this series of studies we show that after oral or nasal ovalbumin (OVA) challenge, allergic mice present increased Fos-expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) and in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA); mice with food allergy display higher levels of anxiety and had increased serum corticosterone levels; and allergyactivated neurons express corticotropin-releasing hormone in the PVN and CeA. OVA-allergic mice develop aversion to an antigen-containing solution, and also avoid a dark compartment previously associated with nebulized OVA. Results on brain Fos expression and behavioral data seem compatible with adaptive responses. Removing IgE by either antibody depletion or the development of oral tolerance precluded every response analyzed here. Csensitive fiber destruction by neonatal capsaicin inhibited the activation in the PVN, but not in the CeA, and decreased the magnitude of food aversion. Cromolyn, a mast cell stabilizer, completely blocked Fos expression in the PVN and CeA, and precluded the development of aversion to the dark compartment associated with nebulized OVA. Employing mice that do not develop an important inflammatory infiltrate following nasal OVA challenge, we found that inflammatory cells are not required at the site of challenge in order to trigger neural or behavioral correlates of murine experimental asthma. Altogether, we build a solid ground for understanding neuroimmune interactions during allergic responses that may contribute to the comprehension of psychological disorders associated with allergy.",

In the present study we demonstrated stressinduced microglial activation in the brain. Based on the finding that circulating IL-18 levels are elevated during the stress, we hypothesized that IL-18 may be involved in the microglial activation in the brain. To test this hypothesis, we administered recombinant IL-18 and monitored microglial activation 6 h after the administration both in-vivo and in-vitro. Under the control conditions as well as 1 ng/g intraperitoneal administration of IL-18, no significant microglial activation was observed. At 5 ng/g of intraperitoneal IL-18 administration, significant microglial activation started to occur. Clear microglial activation was observed following the administration of IL-18 of 10, 20 ng/g as well. In addition, IL-6 and iNOS were induced in microglial cells in response to IL-18 administration. Quantitative real-time PCR study revealed that IL-18 administration induced IL-6, IL-18, iNOS mRNA in cultured microglial cell lines in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, in IL-18 null mice, microglial activation was reduced in the brain in response to 2 h period of stress. Thus, the present study demonstrates that circulating IL-18 may activate microglial cells in the brain, suggesting that stress may induce microglial activation through stress-induced IL-18.",

Since stress suppresses the conventional immune system (i.e. T and B cells) but inversely activates the primordial immune system (i.e. extrathymic T cells, NKT cells, and granulocytes), these parameters were analysed after restraint stress for 24 h. The thymus became atrophic as a function of age, and an age-related increase in the number of lymphocytes was seen in the liver. Although the number of lymphocytes in both the thymus and liver decreased, the magnitude was much more prominent in the thymus. To determine stress-resistant lymphocyte subsets, two-color immunofluorescence tests were conducted. NKT cells were found to be such cells in the liver of young mice. On the other hand, an infiltration of granulocytes due to stress was more prominent in the liver of old mice than in young mice. Liver injury as a result of stress was prominent in young mice. This age-related bias in the function of NKT cells and granulocytes seemed to be associated with a difference in the responses of catecholamines (high in old mice) and corticosterone (high in young mice) after stress. Indeed, an injection of adrenaline mainly induced the infiltration of granulocytes while that of cortisol activated NKT cells. These results suggest the existence of age-related bias in the function of NKT cells and granulocytes after stress and that such bias might be produced by different responses of sympathetic nerves and steroid hormones between young and old mice.",

Kessler et al. (1994) suggested the life time prevalence was more than 13%. SAD often interfere their academic, social, and occupational function. SAD is characterized by the fear of negative evaluation by others, so the patients feel anxiety too much in socially evaluative situation and it impairs psychological and physiological states. In the present study, we conducted Trier Social Stress Test (TSST; Kirschbaum et al., 1993) , which produces firm evaluative situation, to investigate salivary cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) response in socially anxious people. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Waseda University. The participants were 17 male students, divided into 9 high socially anxious (SA) group and 8 low SA group by the score of Short Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale (SFNE; Sasagawa et al., 2004) . Before experiment, they were informed the purpose of present study and signed the consent form. All experiments were conducted between 15:00 and 19:00. In the results of this study, significant correlations were found between AUC (Area Under the Curve) of cortisol and SFNE (r = \u2212 .45, p = .07), and between AUC of cortisol/DHEA ratio and SFNE (r = \u2212 56, p = .02). Further analysis showed DHEA in high SA group rose greater than in low SA group. On the other hand, cortisol in high SA group reacted less in TSST. These results indicated that there was endocrine imbalance in socially anxious people to social stressor and this imbalance might affect the maintenance of SAD.",

However, the precise modulation of those substances induced by such a mental interventions and its mechanism are still unknown. In this study, one of the major secretory immune substance, secretory Immunoglobulin A (sIgA), was assessed to investigate the normal human secretory response induced by a stressful task of deskwork operations focusing on following two points: (1) the precise changing of salivary sIgA under the repetitive short-term stressful works with beaks procedure, and (2) the mathematical model of sIgA modulation induced by that procedure. The results of the experiment in this study indicated that the changes of sIgA concentration within saliva clearly reflected the participants' subjective stress level with a certain time delay depending on the duration of stressful work. Referring with the results of the experiment and previous sIgA studies, I then propose a mathematical model of sIgA modulation based on the logistic function, which is the nonlinear ordinary differential equation consisting of the first order of exponential increasing term and the second order of nonlinear decreasing term, and in other words, it possesses the homeostatic property of living organisms. The result of the simulation of the model is well consistent with the sIgA modulation profiles of the experiment.

Previous studies described elevations of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) levels in saliva and increased oxidative status when exposed to acute psychological stress. Human saliva contains peroxidase and the electron donor SCN-. Ultraweak chemiluminescence (UCL) is based mainly on an electronic transfer in the oxidation-reduction reaction and it registers the oxidative reaction. In order to investigate the relationships between immune functions, oxidative stress and neural reactions, the effects of performance anxiety on salivary UCL were examined and the values were compared with the salivary sIgA levels. Participants and methods: Participants were 10 volunteer students. The subjects performed a task of a serial aseptic manipulation for cell culture. The task was an examination on accuracy and speed in the aseptic manipulation to evaluate a result of a practical training. Saliva was collected 30 min before, immediately after, 30 min after and 60 min after the performance. Results: One-way repeated measures ANOVA for UCL revealed a significant difference across the four measurement occasions (F =4.45, p< 0.05). Post hoc Dunnett's test clarified that UCL levels immediately after the task was significantly greater compared with that 30 min before (p< 0.05). Two-way ANOVA with repeated measures indicated that UCL and sIgA exhibited the same change pattern in the four occasions (F= 0.28, p= 0.84). Conclusion: UCL counts a volume of photons generated during oxidative reactions, which can be an effective monitor of lipid peroxide generation. It was suggested that oxidation may occur during the neural-immune interactions.",

To investigate effects of attraction to the favorite person on the biological systems, we recorded various parameters, namely mood states, heart rate (HR), skin conductance level (SCL), serum levels of several hormones (endorphin, oxytocin, vasopressin, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and cortisol), and proportions of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells in the lymphocytes simultaneously when subjects viewed the video films of their favorite persons. The mood states were assessed by the profile of mood status (POMS), the serum levels of several hormones were measured by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), and the proportions of T cells and NK cells in the lymphocytes were measured by flowcytometer. As results, accompanying self-reported vigorous and better feeling, SCL and the proportion of NK cells significantly increased. No significant changes in HR, the serum levels of various hormones, as well as the proportion of T cells in the lymphocytes were found.

Ohira a a Department of Psychology, Nagoya University, Aichi, Japan; b Japan Society for the Promotion of Science There were accumulated evidences indicating that an acute psychological stressor could elicit lymphocyte redistribution via sympathetic nervous activation. Furthermore, it was also known that a temporal variation of this redistribution was different between lymphocyte subsets. For instance, under the acute stressor, CD3 \u2212 CD16 + CD56 + natural killer cells (NK cells) were remarkably increased in peripheral blood while CD3 + CD4 + helper T cells were slightly decreased or showed no change. One possible explanation about the distinct variations was adhesion molecules expressed on the surface of lymphocytes such as CD62L and CD11a. Recent researches suggested the redistribution of NK cells was occurred differentially based on CD62L expression density. And distinct CD62L expression in NK cell subsets was corresponded to functional differentiations, namely CD56 +high immunomodulatory function and CD56 +low cytotoxic function. Although differential redistributions of these subsets were reported by several studies, temporal variation of these subsets and the relationship with sympathetic nervous activation remained unclear. Thus, present study was conducted to examine these issues in acute stressor paradigm. Ten human participants performed mental arithmetic task as an acute stressor and their blood samples for estimating CD62L + or CD62L-NK cells, CD62L + or CD62Lhelper T cells, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol were taken at each 2 min during the task. Additionally, blood pressure and heart rate were monitored during the experiment. As a result, NK cells showed remarkable increment by the acute stressor and these variations indicated the close relationship with sympathetic nervous activation such as elevated blood pressure.",

So we conducted psycho-educational intervention for the improvement of attitudinal perceived social support among general elderly people and examined the effect on natural killer cell activity. Method: A randomized control cross-over design involved 60 participants 65 years old and over. A ninety-minute intervention was conducted weekly for five successive weeks. The intervention consisted of (1) a lecture about illness and its prevention, (2) relaxation using the 'Dohsa' therapy, and (3) the psycho-educational intervention for perceived social support. Each participant was administered questionnaires and taken a blood sample between 9:00 am and 11:00 noon to control for diurnal variations at four times (baseline, pre-intervention, post-intervention, and follow up). NK cell activity was measured against K562 using a standard 4-h51Cr release assay. Result: There was a significant improvement in the perceived social support score and natural killer cell activity only in the intervention group at postintervention period and follow up period.

NT3 and NT4 alone and in combination induce a moderate increase in axonal growth, while NGF and NGF-including combinations substantially increase axon growth. IL1b had no effect; IL-4 increased NT4-induced outgrowth; IL6 stimulated NT3 + NT4 \u2212 induced outgrowth. IFNg stimulated neurite extension in NT-free controls as well as in the presence of NT3 + NT4 \u2212 and NT3 + NGF. IFNg also stimulated axonal density in the absence of NTs or in the presence of NT4 or NT3 + NT4. TNFa inhibited NT3 \u2212 , NT3 + NGF \u2212 , NT4 + NGF \u2212 , and NT3 + NT4 + NGF-induced outgrowth.",

Microglia thus plays an important role in the pathology of neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The pathological mechanisms of schizophrenia remain unclear while some recent neuroimaging studies suggest even schizophrenia may be a kind of neurodegenerative disease like AD and PD. There have so far been only a few studies on the relationship between microglia and schizophrenia. Atypical antipsychotic drugs (APDs) are becoming standard drugs for the treatment of schizophrenia because of their less adverse effects and more effectiveness for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. We thus investigate the effects of atypical APDs on the production of proinflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide and ROS by activated microglia, and also try to clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects. As compared with haloperidol, a typical conventional APD, several kinds of atypical APDs significantly inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and nitric oxide by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) + Interferon-\u03b3 stimulated microglia. These results suggest that atypical APDs may have more beneficial effects on proinflammatory conditions in the CNS which may play a crucial role in the pathology of schizophrenia.",

Accumulated preclinical and clinical evidences for the action of lithium in the brain suggest that lithium can affect membrane transport systems, neurotransmitter receptor regulation, second messenger systems, protein kinase C (PKC) regulation, and gene expression. Recent studies showed long term, but not acute, treatment of cultured cerebellar granule cells with LiCl induce a concentration-dependent decrease in proapoptotic p53 and Bax level; and remarkably increased cytoprotective Bcl-2 protein. These results suggest that lithium, in addition to its use in the treatment of bipolar depressive illness, may have an expanded use in improving neurodegeneration. However, regulation of lithium on the dendritic cell was not-well defined. Dendritic cells (DC) are key regulators of immune responses, and were involved in the initiation and maintenance of both innate and the adaptive immune responses. We demonstrate lithium chloride treatment enhanced human monocyte-derived CD86 expression. In addition, lithium chloride increased cytokines, TNF-a IL-8, IL-1b, IL-10 and IL-6 production. However, lithium have no effect on T cell proliferation which assayed by mix lymphocyte reaction.

In particular, the innate immune system seems to be activated, accompanied by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neuroinflammatory processes. Viruses, such as measles, and environmental toxins, such as mercury, which are known stimulators of innate immunity have been implicated in the etiology of autism. These stimuli may interact with genetic variables, as there is an increased prevalence of familial autoimmune disorders in parents of probands with PDD. The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) may be particularly relevant to PDD because (1) it is involved in emotional, social and cognitive modulation, (2) it is induced by vaccination and toxins, (3) it mediates the immune responses to mercury, and (4) it plays a major role in autoimmunity. Recently, a variable number tandem repeat polymorphism in the second intron of the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) gene has been found to be associated with increased risks of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. To test the hypothesis that this polymorphism is associated with autism we are currently examining 116 families (128 probands diagnosed with the ADI-R and ADOS-G, and their parents) using a family-based association test (UNPHASED). Furthermore, we are assessing whether the association with IL-1ra is mediated by the role of this gene in specific disturbances in socialemotional and cognitive parameters. The results may implicate genetic alterations in IL-1 signaling in autism and its relationship with autoimmune processes. Major Depression Disorder (MDD) is a common with prevalence of about 15% for men and up to 25% in women. In recent years, the association of immune system alteration and MDD has been reported on the basis of new observations. Therefore, we decided to do more accurate assessment in determining or excluding the relationship between immune system and MDD. Materials and methods: In patients and control group, we determined TNF \u03b1, FN \u03b3, IL-4 and IL-10 (by ELISA), serum immunoglobulin, serum proteins, and markers of immune system cells include CD 16-56, CD19, CD 8, CD 4, CD 3. Results: This study was include 37 patients (28/9: F/M) with mean age of 39 years and fifteen number control. In cytokines study were observed no significant differences between the patient and control group. In the patient group (moderate grade), there was significant relationship only between IL-10 and IFN \u03b3 (p = 0.04). In control group, the relationship between IL-4 and IL-10 was positive and significant (p = 0.04).",

The importance of NK cell activity in schizophrenia is due to their role in immune surveillance against tumoral and viral cells. These studies aim to explain the low incidence of cancer in schizophrenic patients. But no consistent findings have emerged. Majority of the inconsistencies must be due to the effects of various confounding factors, such as smoking, medications, etc. The purpose of this study was to evaluate NK activity in schizophrenic patients with eliminating the effect of such factors. In this study, we have chosen 30 medication-free schizophrenic patients and 41 healthy sex, age and smoking status matched individuals. NK cell activity of case and control subjects was measured by MTT (Methyl-Thiazol-Tetrazolium) test. Statistical analysis of the data was obtained using SPSS 11.5. NK activity of patients had a mean of 36.93550 \u00b1 26.152416 (Mean \u00b1 SD) and NK activity mean of normal subjects was 22.31171 \u00b1 17.923737. Statistical analysis showed a significant increase in NK activity in schizophrenic patients compared with controls (P = 0.011). Also, NK activity of smoking patients was significantly lower than that of nonsmoking patients (P = 0.02). Other demographic factors did not show any influence on NK activity. The higher activity of NK cells in the schizophrenic patients as compared with the control population could explain the low incidence of cancer in these patients. And decreasing effect of smoking on NK activity in the patients could be one of the responsible factors for the inconsistency in results of different studies. For decades, the relationship between the Immune system and schizophrenia has attracted considerable research in Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI). There are a few etiologic hypotheses connected to this proposed relationship, being Viral infections, Autoimmunity and Activation of Tlymphocyte-Macrophage. This Study focuses on a comparative analysis of the immune function of 30 drug-free schizophrenic patients and 42 healthy individuals who are matched in sex and age and Smoking status. In this analysis, proliferation of T cells in response to PHA (PhytoHaemAgglutinin) mitogen, was measured with MethylThiazolTetrazolium Test (MTT). Serum ANA (Anti-Nuclear-Antibody) level and ACA (AntiCytoplasmic-Antibody) presence and Circulating Immune Complexes (CIC) concentration were measured with Indirect Immuno-Fluorescence and PEG precipitation tests, respectively. The results of these assays were then analyzed with SPSS 11.5. T cell proliferation of patients had a mean of 1.96417 \u00b1 0.830684 and T cell proliferation mean of normal subjects was 3.72971 \u00b1 1.398237. Statistical analysis showed a significant decrease in T cell proliferation in schizophrenic patients compared with controls (P = 0.000). Serum ANA level and CIC concentration were not significantly different between the two groups (P = 0.661, P = 0.102, respectively). ACA was shown to be present only in the case group (P = 0.004).

The frequencies of IL-10 promoter-3575 T/A SNP T allele and IL-10 promoter \u22122763C/A SNP C allele were also significantly increased in patients compared with controls (p < 0.05). Furthermore, comparing to controls, the frequency of IL-10 \u22121082 A allele was significantly increased in all patients (p =0.024), patients with positive family history (n = 63) (p = 0.015), undifferentiated (p = 0.031), non-disorganized (p = 0.011) and nonresidual (p = 0.02) subtypes.

Similarly, the frequency of IL-10 \u2212592 A allele was significantly increased in patients with positive family history (p = 0.044) and non-disorganized subtype (p = 0.03). Our preliminary haplotype analyses suggest that the frequency of IL-10 promoter haplotypes, which are associated with high IL-10 production are increased in schizophrenia. Our results suggest that IL-10 promoter SNPs may be associated with the increased risk of schizophrenia.

Three SNPs; rs3782736, rs7957426 and rs10774450 showed a significant pvalue at the 5% significance level. No haplotype association was found and all associated SNPs were located within the same LD block. In order to confirm these results, all three significant markers were genotyped in an independent case control material, consisting of 1720 Nordic (Norway, Denmark and Finland) MS patients and 1416 Nordic healthy controls. None of the associations from the Swedish case/control material did replicate in the Nordic material. We conclude that the CD4 gene is not of major genetic importance in MS in a Nordic population.",

The enhanced immune response to EBV in the affected twins is in keeping with previous work on sporadic patients. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role in several processes underlying the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). They are involved in transendothelial monocyte migration, myelin phagocytosis and breakdown, oligodendrocyte damage and axonal degeneration. Exposure of cells to high levels of ROS induces oxidative stress, which leads to the activation of the nuclear transcription factor Nrf2. Activation of this transcription factor induces expression of antioxidant response elements (ARE)-regulated genes. These genes encode for endogenous enzymes that regulate cellular redox status and offer protection against oxidative stress and inflammation. Thus, expression of Nrf2/ARE proteins may act as a sensitive indicator of oxidative stress. So far, data on the expression ARE-regulated enzymes in brains of MS patients are lacking. Hence, we investigated the distribution of various endogenous antioxidant enzymes, including heme oxygenase, superoxide dismutase, peroxiredoxins, catalase and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase in different MS lesion types. We showed for the first time that antioxidant enzymes are highly upregulated in active demyelinated MS lesions, particularly in hypertrophic astrocytes and myelin-laden macrophages. We speculate that increased antioxidant enzyme expression may reflect an endogenous defense response and may compensate ROS-mediated cellular toxicity. Compounds that activate the Nrf2-ARE signalling pathway, via expression of detoxifying enzymes, may be a potential therapeutic target for future treatment strategies in MS.",

It is assumed that in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesions reactivation of infiltrating autoreactive lymphocytes is most likely mediated by local antigen presenting cells (APCs), such as microglia/macrophages. Antigen presentation requires major histocompatibility (MHC) antigen-processing, a complex interplay a several proteins belonging to the antigen-processing machinery (APM). In order to evaulate the regulation of APM molecules in relation to MS lesion formation, we investigated the expression of various MHC APM molecules in human brain specimens from MS patients (n =4) by means of immunohistochemistry. In relation to MHC class II, microglia/ macrophates exhibited 2 to 3-fold higher expression of MCH APM molecules in active (early-active, late-active and chronic-active) than in inactive (chronic-inactive) MS lesions. Interestingly, albeit higher frequencies of microglia and macrophages in borders of active lesions were observed, the expression of numerous MHC APM components such as delta, low molecular weight protein-2 (LMP-2), LMP-7, LMP-10, transporter associated with antigen zprocessing-1 (TAP1), calnexin and calreticulin was 1.5 to 2 fold higher in lesion centres than in lesion borders or normal appearing white matter (NAWM). In contrast to this, chronic-inactive MS lesions were characterized by comparable amounts of MHC APM expression in lesion borders and centres. Our data demonstrate microglia cells and macrophages to have the capacity to process and present antigens alike professional APCs. Reduced expression of MHC APM molecules in lesion borders in comparison to lesions centers could suggest antiinflammatory countermechanisms circumventing the broadening of MS-lesions.",

Background: AQPs constitute an evolutionarily conserved family of integral membrane water transport channel proteins.

Methods: AQP1 and AQP4 expression was studied in cell cultures and brain tissues of four conventional MS cases by RT-PCR, Western blot and immunochemistry. Results: Human astrocytes in culture constitutively expressed both AQP1 and AQP4 on the cell surface. AQP4 protein levels were elevated in astrocytes by exposure to IFNG, but not by TNFA or IL-1B, while AQP1 was unaffected by any cytokines. AQP1 and AQP4 protein levels positively correlated with those of GFAP in MS brain homogenates. Varying numbers of non-hypertrophic astrocytes with elaborated processes contacting blood vessels, but neither macrophages nor neurons, expressed intensely both AQP1 and AQP4 in MS and non-MS brains. Conclusions: AQP1 and AQP4 were expressed predominantly in nonhypertrophic astrocytes widely distributed in the whole CNS, suggesting a redundant role of both AQPs in astrocyte water balance, and an involvement of undefined regional factors in the selective lesion distribution in OSMS.",

Recently, evidence is accumulating that chemokines play an important role, not only in the leukocytes recruitment into the inflammatory site, but also in the recruitment of brain parenchymal cells. To elucidate the pathomechanisms of SPMS in terms of glial activation, we have investigated the expression of chemokines, MCP-1/CCL2 and IP-10/CXCL10, and their receptor, CCR2 and CXCR3 in the demyelinating plaques. Immunohistochemical analysis of autopsy brain tissues provided by UK Multiple Sclerosis Tissue Bank revealed that numerous hypertrophic astrocytes were observed at the rim, but not in the center, of the chronic active lesions. Microglia/macrophages phagocytosing myelin debris were also found at the lesion border. In contrast, T cell infiltration was minimal in these plaques. Characteristically, there were abundant immunoreactivities for MCP-1/ CCL2, IP-10/CXCL10, CCR2 and CXCR3 at the rim of the lesions with ongoing demyelination, whereas these immunoreactivities were relatively weak in the center of the lesions, forming chemokine gradients. Double immunofluorescense staining revealed that both chemokines and their receptors were expressed by hypertrophic astrocytes, while only chemokine receptors were expressed by MHC class II-positive microglia/macrophages. In addition, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) that is reported to be one of final effectors for demyelination was predominantly expressed at the rim of the plaque. These findings suggest that chemokine expression by astrocytes plays an important role in microglia/macrophage activation and expansion of demyelinating lesions in SPMS. Targeting chemokines in SPMS could therefore be a powerful therapeutic approach to inhibit lesional expansion.",

The results showed that reactivity for DR molecules varied among microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in all CNS tissue studied and on inflammatory cells in active MS lesions. DR expression was not specific to MS and was seen at different levels in other neurological diseases (OND), and normal CNS tissue. DcR1 was expressed on oligodendrocytes in the CNS of all groups. To examine the functional implications of DR expression, human oligodendrocytes grown in vitro, were exposed to TRAIL, and apoptosis measured by FACS using the TUNEL technique. The findings both in vivo and in vitro show that although oligodendrocytes in MS, OND and normal CNS express DR5 and display apoptosis when treated with TRAIL in vitro, there was negligible evidence of oligodendrocyte apoptosis in and around MS lesions. These findings suggest that the loss of oligodendrocytes in MS is probably the result of a non-apoptotic mechanism and that there is preservation around and within some lesions that may be linked to the presence of decoy receptors.",

We have initiated studies to evaluate the immunopathology of ON. Methods: Pathologic optic nerves were obtained at autopsy from a patient with clinical recovery from clinically isolated ON. Normal optic nerves and ON tissues were probed with antibodies to pathologic antigens including myelin basic protein (MBP) fragment, the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), macrophage markers CD14 and CD64, nitrotyrosine, and cyclooxygenase (COX-2). We also examined myelin basic protein (MBP), the oligodendrocyte marker cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (CNPase), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Results: In the affected pathologic nerve, iNOS + macrophages/microglia, iNOS + astrocytes, COX-2, and nitrotyrosine were observed. iNOS and COX-2 were occasionally observed in the unaffected nerve. Decreased expression of MBP and CNPase was seen in the pathologic optic nerves, along with evidence of gliosis and ongoing myelin degradation indicated by the presence of MBP fragment. Conclusions: The immunopathology of clinically isolated optic neuritis from this individual resembles that observed in active MS plaques. Despite clinical recovery, there was evidence of ongoing inflammation and demyelination.",

As activated macrophages and microglia are thought to be pivotal to the development of inflammatory lesions in the central nervous system of patients with MS, we hypothesize that reduced expression of CD200 is involved in activation of these normally quiescent cells. Therefore, we first study the expression of CD200 and CD200R in post-mortem frozen brain tissue from MS patients and controls by immunohistochemistry. Secondly, we use the laser dissection microscope to isolate well defined areas (rim and centre) of chronic active and chronic inactive white matter MS lesions. In these areas, gene expression profiles of CD200 and CD200R in relation to other molecules involved in myeloid cell regulation are determined by real time quantitative PCR, and compared with normal appearing white matter from both MS patients and healthy controls. Preliminary results show upregulation of CD200 in the rim of chronic active lesions, whereas in the rim and centre of chronic inactive lesions, CD200 is downregulated.",

AMPA receptor antagonists have been shown to protect oligodendrocytes and axons in EAE, without altering the inflammatory response. Only oligodendrocytes, but not axons, are known to express AMPA receptors and axonal damage from excitotoxicity is believed to require the presence of oligodendrocytes [Underhill S.M., Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 27 (2002) , 869.2]. Since axons are lost in chronic demyelinated MS lesions, we examined the hypothesis that axons are vulnerable to glutamate excitotoxicity in the absence of oligodendrocytes. The cuprizone toxicity model was utilized in 4 week-old mice to eliminate oligodendrocytes and myelin from CNS white matter tracts. After 8 weeks of oral cuprizone administration, absence of myelin and oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum was confirmed by Luxol fast blue and anti-CNPase staining. Microstereotactic infusion of the glutamate receptor agonist, AMPA, but not control vehicle, into the demyelinated corpus callosum resulted in substantial axonal damage as assessed by axon-specific Thy1-YFP fluorescent labeling. These results indicate that AMPA toxicity to axons can take place in the absence of oligodendrocytes or myelin. Extracellular glutamate is likely increased in chronic MS lesions due to excess glutamate production and/or decreased glutamate transporter expression. Thus, excitotoxic damage to demyelinated axons is a feasible scenario. Excitotoxicity could therefore contribute to accumulation of axonal loss in MS lesions and may thus represent a target for neuroprotective intervention. D.

Reasons for this attenuated repair might involve inhibitory factors within areas of myelin destruction, failure of demyelinated axons to support myelinating oligodendrocytes, or intrinsic limitations in the capacity of adult oligodendrocyte precursor cells. In the mature CNS, fibres with axonal segments lacking myelin sheaths can be generated experimentally by induction of axonal sprouting. We investigated the ability of axonal sprouting to induce a myelination response in the stratum radiatum and lucidum of the hippocampal CA3 region (srl-CA3) in the adult murine CNS, a region with pure sprouting and no degeneration. Using transection of the entorhino-hippocampal perforant pathway and an oligodendrocyte specific transgenic marker, we demonstrated that axonal sprouting in the srl-CA3 resulted in a significant 28% increase in the number of oligodendrocytes and a marked myelination response with a 41% increase in the length of myelinated fibres. Scattered proliferation of NG2 + oligodendrocyte precursor cells suggested a slow recruitment of myelinating cells. In contrast, in the dentate gyrus where degeneration occurs there was a strong NG2 + cell response but no subsequent change in oligodendrocyte numbers. Our study demonstrates that newly sprouted axons are able to elicit a myelination response in the mature CNS. This points to the healthy axon as a means to stimulate myelin repair in demyelinating disease.",

Methods: We developed a transgenic mouse line that selectively expressed Syncytin-1 in the CNS, together with performing analyses of host responses in brains of MS and non-MS patients and in cultured human neural cells. Results: Implantation of TNF\u03b1 into the corpus callosum of Syncytin-1 transgenic mice caused neuroinflammation, neurobehavioral deficits and oligodendrocyte injury while also activating the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related genes, GADD153/CHOP, BiP, PERK, Grp58/ERp57, OASIS and iNOS, compared to wild type littermate controls. Similar findings of ER stress gene and iNOS induction were observed in the brains of MS patients. Syncytin-1 induced both OASIS and iNOS expression in astrocytes in conjunction with the repressive transcription factor, Egr1, which binds the promoter of ASCT1, a putative Syncytin-1 receptor. Likewise treatment of astrocytes with a nitric oxide donor also suppressed ASCT1. Astrocyte dysfunction resulting from ER stress was characterized by diminished levels of ASCT1 and trophic factors, particularly IGF-1. Inhibition of ASCT-1 in astrocytes resulted in reduced oligodendrocyte viability, which was mirrored by reduced ASCT-1 expression in the brains of Syncytin-1 transgenic mice and MS patients compared to respective controls. Discussion: The mechanism of oligodendrocyte damage and demyelination described herein represents a novel pathway by which over-expression of a human endogenous retroelement protein, Syncytin-1, leads to astrocyte dysfunction with adverse consequences in terms of oligodendrocyte viability and function.",

During a study on mice overexpressing CCL2 (MCP-1) a chemokine involved in monocyte recruitment, in which the chemokine was under control of a myelin basic protein promoter and was produced by oligodendrocytes, we noticed that, widespread evidence of hypomyelination was apparent throughout the CNS in mice up to four months of age, most pronounced in optic nerves and subpial zones of spinal cord. In these areas, oligodendrocytes retained an immature phenotype, structurally and immunocytochemically, the vast majority (>75%) of axons were non-myelinated and of small caliber, the remainder thinly myelinated, and astrocytes and their processes invested the naked axons. Apart from an occasional monocyte within the CNS, breakdown of myelin and oligodendrocyte pathology were not prominent. In older animals, deeper white matter was more normally myelinated but interstitial parenchyma was intensely gliotic and there was some evidence of apoptosis of oligodendrocytes. Electrophysiology for visual evoked potentials showed responses to be delayed and substantially diminished in peak amplitude compared to age-matched, wild-type littermates. Data will be presented on protein levels for the myelination-related gene profile and for developmental pathways associated with oligodendrocyte maturation, which was apparently arrested. These findings underscore the need for the careful analysis of CNS architecture in models involving transgenes expressed by glial cells.

Our previous studies indicate that increased calpain activity correlates with production of the Th1 cytokine interleukin (IL)-2 in activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we hypothesize that calpain expression/activity will correlate with Th1/Th2 cytokine dysregulation in activated PBMCs from relapsing/remitting MS patients and that treatment with a calpain inhibitor will alter cytokine production. In order to investigate a role of calpain in Th1/Th2 cytokine dysregulation, PBMCs from relapsing/remitting MS patients and age/sexmatched controls were pretreated for 1 h with the calpain inhibitor calpeptin (100 \u03bcM) or vehicle (DMSO). Cells were then activated for 24 h with anti-CD3 (10 \u03bcg/ml) + anti-CD28 (5 \u03bcg/ml) and harvested for Western blot analysis of calpain expression and activity. Supernatants were collected for determining levels of Th1 (IL-2) and Th2 (IL-4, IL-10) cytokines. Preliminary data indicate that calpain expression and activity were significantly (p \u2264 0.05) increased in both activated and unactivated PBMCs from remission and relapse patients versus controls. IL-2 production was significantly increased in relapse patients, while IL-4 and IL-10 levels were higher in remission patients. Interestingly, pretreating PBMCs with calpeptin resulted in a decrease in both Th1 and Th2 cytokine levels. These data suggest that calpain plays an important role in the production of cytokines in patients with MS. Supported by NIH-NINDS. Dendritic cells (DC) are potent antigen-presenting cells and are critical for onset of the immune responses generates against infections. Bacteria and viruses have been implicated in autoimmune disease pathogenesis. Indeed, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) relapses are frequently associated with infection, in some instances bacterial. The hypothesis of this study was to establish whether DC from bacteria-infected MS patients modified autoreactive T cells patterns of activation, thus triggering disease exacerbation. CD1 + , CD11c + , CD80 + , CD86 + , CD14 \u2212 , HLA-DR bright DC were separated from peripheral blood during 11 exacerbations linked to bacterial infections and 11 relapses without infections. DC antigenpresenting capacity was assessed with MBP, MOG, GM1, and GM3 specific autologous T cell clones (TCCs). TCCs stimulated with DC from infected MS patients showed maximal proliferation, and induced the secretion of IL-12, IL-17, and IFN-\u03b3 at 10 to 30 times less concentration than after incubation with DC isolated from uninfected individuals. Interestingly, CD1-restricted GM1 and GM3 TCCs incubated with DC from infected MS patients secreted IFN-\u03b3, and IL-12 even in the absence of exogenous antigens. These activation patterns correlate with increased in T cell survival. DC from infected MS patients secreted more IL-12 and IL-18, and showed higher expression of the myeloid differentiation factor 88, as well as molecules CD1, B7-1, B7-2, B7-DC, CD40, CD83 and CCR7, as compared to DC from uninfected individuals. Overall, these results are consistent with the concept that during bacterial infections, DC play a critical role in MS relapse induction.",

Supernatants of the different conditioned PBMCs were added to neuroblastoma cell lines under starving condition in order to study their neuro-protective potential, as measured by neuronal cell count, neurites count or length. Cellular analysis of BDNF production was done by flow cytometry. PBMCs of RR-MS patients secreted lower BDNF (1044 \u00b1 377 pg/ml) compared to HC (1360 \u00b1 386 pg/ ml, p = 0.046). Monocytes was found to be the dominant BDNF producers (28.0%), compared to T cells (1.0%) and B cells (0.8%). Stimulation of PBMCs from HC with either anti CD3 mAb, anti CD40 mAb or LPS enhanced BDNF secretion (1602 \u00b1 666 pg/ml, p = 0.002; 1483 \u00b1 605 pg/ml, p = 0.01; 2940 \u00b1 1052 pg/ml, p < 0.001, respectively). Only anti CD3 mAb stimulation enhanced IFN-\u03b3 secretion (2249 \u00b1 699 pg/ml vs. 31-71 pg/ml in other conditions, p < 0.05). Supernatants of PBMCs that were cultured with anti CD40 or LPS induced protective effect on neuroblastoma cell lines, while supernatants of anti CD3 stimulated PBMCs induced cell death. BDNF secretion from PBMCs of RR-MS patients failed to be up-regulated by anti-CD40. In summary, Lower BDNF production by immune cells in RR-MS is related to dys-regulation of BDNF via CD40 and may contribute the neuronal damage of RR-MS. Activated \u03b3\u03b4 T cells lyse human oligodendrocytes in vitro but the exact mechanism of lysis is unknown. There are many ways in which \u03b3\u03b4 T cells could exert cytotoxicity and we have investigated the possibility that they might participate in antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) via their expression of Fc\u03b3 receptor III (Fc\u03b3RIII, CD16). To investigate if \u03b3\u03b4 T cells derived from MS patients were able to cause specific injury to target cells via ADCC, we established an in vitro experimental system using a humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab (Rituxan\u00ae) as the bridging antibody and CD20 + B lymphoma cells lines as targets. Cytotoxicity was measured with multiple parameter flow cytometry. Our results show that, with Effector:Target ratio (E:T) at or above 4:1, the ADCC-type specific cytotoxicity of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells against the Raji cell line was significantly increased by the presence of rituximab (p < 0.02). Our findings suggest that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, via Fc receptor binding, could lyse potential targets. Antibodies to myelin proteins are increased in both MS serum and spinal fluid, raising the possibility that if \u03b3\u03b4 T cells bind these antibodies, they could become effective targeted killers of oligodendrocytes.",

Human NK cells, CD8 + T cells and gamma delta T cells express NKG2D, a stimulating or costimulating receptor recognizing multiple ligands. NKG2D ligands, usually expressed on stressed/damaged cells are aberrantly expressed on targets during autoimmune inflammatory diseases such as celiac disease and rheumatoid arthritis and can contribute to enhance cytotoxic immune effectors locally. We sought to determine whether NKG2D ligands are expressed on human CNS cells. NKG2D ligands were detected on primary cultures of human adult oligodendrocytes and fetal astrocytes. Proinflammatory cytokines increased their expression on astrocytes, suggesting that under inflammatory conditions, such ligands could be upregulated. In vitro killing assays using activated human gamma delta T cells (or NK cells) as effectors demonstrated that both oligodendrocytes and astrocytes are susceptible to NKG2D-mediated injury since NKG2D blockade consistently reduced the extent of death. Immunohistochemical analyses suggest that NKG2D ligands are selectively detected in MS lesions but are absent from normal appearing white matter. These results imply that the recognition of NKG2D ligands on oligodendrocytes and astrocytes by NKG2D bearing immune effectors could contribute to cytotoxic responses especially in inflammatory conditions such as those occurring in MS.",

Methods: A prospective study including clinical, radiological and/or immunological follow-up of 42 MS-patients during pregnancy and six months into the postpartum period. Groups of healthy pregnant and nonpregnant persons and non-pregnant MS-patients were studied as controls. Laboratory investigations included measurement of intracytoplasmic cytokine production in peripheral blood lymphocytes and subtype analysis of T cells, B cells and NK cells both during and after pregnancy using immunofluorescence staining and FACS analysis. Results: Annualized relapse rate was significantly reduced during third trimester of pregnancy and increased after the delivery.

Conversely, striking inverse correlation occurs between parasite infections and autoimmune diseases. The immune responses of 23 MS patients during viral infections, and 12 MS patients presenting parasite infections were studied. Numbers of IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-12 secreting cells, were higher in PBMC collected during exacerbations associated to viral infections, than during stable disease or exacerbations without infections. In parasite infected MS patients on the other hand, MBP-specific responses showed a significant increase in IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2, and a decrease in IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 secreting cells, compared with uninfected MS individuals. In addition, only viral antigen (Ag) stimulation induced maximal myelin-Ag specific T cells effector response, at concentrations 20 to 30 times lower than native Ag alone. Moreover, MBP-specific T cell clones from parasite-infected patients were characterized by a cytokine profile similar to Th3 and Tr1 T cell subsets, and cloning frequency of CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + T cells was substantially increased in parasite infected MS patients compared both to uninfected and viral infected MS individuals. Overall, these observations suggest that whereas viral infections can increase PBMC response to myelin-Ag causing a Th1-like response increasing the relapse risk, parasite infections are able to induce regulatory T cells that on the contrary, can induce remission of the disease.",

The biological mechanisms behind this phenomenon are largely unknown. Better insight in which natural immune and endocrine mechanisms are associated with clinically suppressed disease in MS can be of relevance for future management of the disease. In the Rotterdam Study on Pregnancy in MS, we aim to investigate the immune alterations that can be observed in the peripheral blood. We here investigated gene expression in the different stages before, during and after pregnancy. Blood monocytes were purified using MACS, RNA was extracted and gene expression was probed using Affymetrix RNA-arrays. Samples were assessed in longitudinal series of 4 time points per patient. After correction for multiple testing (22,000 gene transcripts), in a pilot study more than 100 genes were differentially expressed in the monocyte fraction during pregnancy compared with the non-pregnancy timepoint. The majority of genes was downregulated and most were linked to immune functions, such as chemokine family members and proinflammatory cytokines. This lends support to the hypothesis that during pregnancy also innate responses are attenuated. Significant findings will be confirmed with Taqman-PCR and at the protein level using immunoassays. Moreover data will be correlated to serum Il-10, IL-17 and IL-23 levels (measured by ELISA), as well as clinical disease activity, such as exacerbation after delivery.",

These CD14 + /CD34 + cells are endowed with a high proliferative potential and display differentiation potential toward macrophages, dendritic cells and possibly microglia. Here, we assessed the behavior of blood-circulating CD34 + myeloid cells in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. We analyzed by FACS the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from 10 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), 10 primary progressive MS (PPMS) and 10 healthy control subjects. In parallel experiments, we performed a functional assay by culturing PBMC in methylcellulose supplemented with macrophagecolony stimulating factor. The percentage of CD14 + cells, MHC class II + cells or CD86 + cells was unchanged in MS patients as compared to controls. In contrast, both RRMS patients and RPMS patients showed increased percentages of CD34 + myeloid cells (4.59 \u00b1 0.5% in RRMS patients, 4.57 \u00b1 0.52% in RPMS patients, 2.71 \u00b1 0.23% in controls, \u204e\u204e\u204e p < 0.005, Student's t test). Such an increase was partly due to the specific expansion of CD14 + /CD34 + cells as shown by double-staining experiments. Accordingly, we could generate large colonies of macrophages (at least 50 cells per colony) in MS patients (2 out of 5) but not controls (0 out of 5).

To investigate natural autoantibodies, serum at a 1:10 dilution was assayed on two independent arrays and results analyzed using GeneSpring software. We found that we could distinguish RRMS, SPMS or PPMS from healthy controls by unique antibody patterns, but not by a single antibody reactivity. These antibody patterns were used to analyze the test set and correctly identified 75% of RRMS, 80% of SPMS and 94% of PPMS. The patterns we observed were different from those we found for other neurologic diseases. The discriminating patterns of antibody reactivity demonstrated that IgG was more informative that IgM, however, detailed analysis of IgG1 and IgG4 antibodies did not improve sensitivity.

Among the 66 cases with positive anti-HTLV-I Abs, the incidence of CSF anti-hnRNP A1 Abs were far lower in HAM/TSP (35.0%, n = 40) than in the group of other diseases (57.7%, n = 26). Interpretation: The present study confirmed our previous finding regarding the significant association of CSF anti-hnRNP A2/B1 Abs with MS but it failed to demonstrate any diagnostic value of CSF anti-hnRNP A1 Abs in HAM/ TSP. CSF anti-hnRNP A2/B1 Abs may provide a clue in the diagnosis of MS. [Objective] Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection has been previously reported to be related to various diseases. Neutrophil activating protein (HP-NAP) is capable of activating neutrophils and monocytes. The aim of this study was to disclose the prevalence of HP infection and the immune response to HP proinflammatory protein, HP-NAP, in Japanese patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).",

Methods: Simple and reliable objective measurements of facets of parkinsonism underpin statistical modelling, hypothesis generation and efficacy studies. Results: To date, proof-of-principle that infection contributes to idiopathic parkinsonism (IP) has been provided by case studies and interim protocol analyses of an efficacy study contrasting effect, on the time-course of IP facets, of successful Helicobacter pylori (Hp) eradication vs. placebo, and vs. failure (Helicobacter 2005; 10:267-297) . 'Malignant' IP appears converted to 'benign', but marked deterioration accompanied failure. Categorisation, according to presence/absence of overt Helicobacter infection, was a useful therapeutic tool even in late IP with cachexia. Although Hp infection is overt in a minority of probands, the predicted probability of having the parkinsonian label depends on the serum immunoblot Hp antibody profile, with clinically-relevant gradients between this \"discriminant index\" and disease-burden and -progression. Indeed, as we begin to explore urea-breath-test negative IP, we are finding molecular evidence for infection in gastric biopsies, where there is no growth on routine culture (presumably due to low organism density). Moreover, early experience of open intervention suggests that it might prove as beneficial as in culture-positive cases. Conclusion: This points to a direct or surrogate (not necessarily unique) role of a particular infection in the pathogenesis of IP. With eradication-failure, bolus-release of antigen from killed bacteria, could aggravate an effect of ongoing infection. The apparent importance of Helicobacter in the aetiology/pathogenesis of IP is not confined to those with overt infection.",

Axonal damage beginning at the early stage of MS is responsible for permanent neurological deficits, although its molecular mechanism remains unknown. The aim is to study the prevalence of autoantibodies against Nogo-A and Nogo receptor (NgR) in the serum of MS. Methods: The antibodies were identified in the serum of 30 MS patients, 22 patients with non-MS neurological diseases (OND), and 22 healthy control (HC) subjects by Western blot using recombinant human Nogo-A-specific segment (NAS), the shared segment of Nogo-A and -B (NAB), Nogo-66 (N66), the non-glycosylated form of NgR, the glycosylated NgR (NgR-Fc), and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). Results: None showed IgG antibodies against NAS or NAB. In contrast, 30% of MS, 23% of OND and 32% of HC subjects exhibited anti-N66 IgG, while 27% of MS, 27% of OND and 18% of HC showed anti-MOG IgG. None of HC but 33% of MS and 14% of OND showed anti-non-glycosylated NgR IgG. Furthermore, 60% of MS, 18% of OND and 14% of HC showed anti-NgR-Fc IgG. Conclusions: Because IgG autoantibodies against N66, NgR and MOG are often detected in the serum of MS and controls, they do not serve as a MSspecific marker. We have measured cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum levels of active matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and its tissue inhibitor TIMP-2 by Activity Assay System and ELISA, respectively, in 51 relapsingremitting (RR) multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, grouped according to clinical and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) evidence of disease activity, in 50 patients with other inflammatory neurological disorders (OIND) and in 50 patients with non-inflammatory neurological disorders (NIND). Statistical analysis was performed by Mann-Whitney, with Bonferroni post-hoc correction, and Spearman rank correlation coefficient tests. CSF and serum active MMP-2/TIMP-2 ratios were higher in MS than in NIND (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively) and in MRI inactive than in MRI active MS patients (p < 0.01 and p < 0.02, respectively) whereas CSF active MMP-2/TIMP-2 ratio was more elevated in MS than in OIND (p < 0.05). An intrathecal synthesis of active MMP-2 and TIMP-2 was greater in MS than in OIND and NIND (p < 0.001) and in MRI inactive than in MRI active MS patients (p < 0.05). In addition, a positive correlation (R = 0.303; p < 0.01) was found between serum active MMP-2/ TIMP-2 ratio and MS disease duration. Overall, these results suggest that a shift in MMP-2/TIMP-2 balance towards proteolytic activity of MMP-2 could be relevant in tissue repair of a subset of MS patients with MRI inactive disease and seem to indicate that serum active MMP-2/TIMP-2 ratio may represent a potential surrogate biomarker for monitoring MS disease duration.",

Methods: The expressions of AMs and the levels of 17 cytokines in patients with PPMS were compared with those in SPMS and controls and correlated with the volumes of focal and atrophic changes in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results: The expressions of very late activation antigen 4 (VLA-4), lymphocyte function associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule1 (ICAM-1) in blood and CSF were higher in PPMS than in controls. Comparison between PPMS and SPMS showed higher levels of ICAM-1 in blood and CSF in PPMS, while the level of vascular adhesion molecule (VCAM-1) was higher only in blood. There was no difference in the levels of cytokines in serum or CSF between PPMS and SPMS or controls, but the evidence for intrathecal synthesis of IL-8 and MCP-1 was found in PPMS. The expressions of CSF VLA-4 in PPMS correlated with the total volume of cerebral lesions and the number of diffuse brain lesions in MRI, while the amount of LFA-1 in CSF correlated with the number of spinal T2 lesions. Conclusions: The upregulated expressions of AMs in blood and CSF and evidence for intrathecal synthesis of MCP-1 and IL-8 in PPMS indicate the importance of inflammatory changes in the pathogenesis of PPMS and suggest the use of these molecules as markers of disease activity in this MS subtype.",

High-dose methylprednisolon (HDMP) i.v. therapy has been established for treatment of acute relapses in MS-patients. However, only scant information on the impact of corticosteroid treatment on (auto-) antibodies is available. Objectives: To establish an ELISA test system for detection of serum IgG and IgM Abs directed against refolded recombinant human MOG. To prospectively investigate whether acute relapses and subsequent HDMP therapy have an impact on serum anti-MOG Abs in MS-patients and whether anti-MOG Ab levels might predict the responsiveness to HDMP therapy. Methods: Anti refolded recombinant human MOG ELISA has been evaluated in 184 MS-patients and 188 healthy controls (HC). 25 MSpatients were then prospectively enrolled and serum samples were analyzed in remission before relapse, during acute relapse before HDMP treatment and 6 weeks after HDMP therapy. Results: Anti-MOG IgG (sensitivity 27.7% specificity 89.9%, p < 0.001) and anti-MOG IgM (sensitivity 23.4%, specificity 89.9%, p < 0.001) antibody levels were significantly increased in MS-patients compared to HC. HDMP treatment significantly reduced anti-MOG IgG (p < 0.001) and total IgG (p < 0.01), but not anti-MOG IgM and total IgM Ab levels. Patients with complete remission from acute relapse had a significant increase of anti-MOG IgM Ab levels from baseline to acute relapse values. Conclusion: The findings from this prospective study could be important for future decisions in patients with acute relapses, especially decisions regarding either dosing/duration of HDMP or escalating therapies. We demonstrated that in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) deregulation of programmed cell death (PCD) play key role in inducing or maintaining autoreactive immune phenomenon leading to demyelinating lesions.",

In multiple sclerosis (MS) it is possible to study axonal loss known to occur in the early stage of the disease. Irreversible axonal loss is associated with brain atrophy, and overtime lead to clinical disability. Objective: Investigate whether changes in the area of the corpus callosum (CC) are detected early in patients with probable MS. Methods: Brain MRI were performed in 28 subjects (20 females, 8 males) with a clinically isolated demyelinating event suggestive of MS (probable MS). 24 healthy subjects matched for age and gender served as controls. The mid-sagittal brain MR image was used for measurement of the CC (total area) and its sub-regions (anterior, middle, posterior). Results: The area of the CCn in patients with probable MS did not differ significantly from healthy subjects matched for age and sex. However, the total area of the CCn in the probable MS group significantly diminished from 539.6 \u00b1 81.6 mm 2 at baseline, to 516.9 \u00b1 57.3 mm 2 after one year (p < 0.05). The decrease was mainly attributed to the middle region of the CC that diminished from 227.0 \u00b1 51.3 mm 2 at baseline to 209.9 \u00b1 25.4 mm 2 after one year (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Measurement of CC area and its sub-regions is a reliable tool to detect early changes in the CC. Our findings demonstrate that structural changes can be detected even in patients with probable MS, and thus support the role of early treatment even in patients with probable MS.",

Methods: Total RNA of PBMC incubated with 50 ng/ml rhIFNB in vitro was processed for cDNA microarray and real-time RT-PCR analysis. Results: Among total 1258 genes, IFNB elevated the expression of 107 and 87 but reduced 22 and 23 genes at 3 and 24 h. Upregulated genes were categorized into conventional IFN-response markers, components of IFNsignaling pathways, chemokines, cytokines, regulators of apoptosis and DNA damage, and heat shock proteins. IFNB markedly upregulated CXCR3 ligand chemokines (SCYB11, SCYB10 and SCYB9) active on effector Th1 cells, and CCR2 ligand chemokines (SCYA8 and SCYA2) effective on monocytes, whereas it downregulated CXCR2 ligand chemokines (SCYB2, SCYB1 and IL8) active on neutrophils. Eleven genes including ISG15, IFI6-16, IRF7, TAP1 and TNFAIP6 were elevated in 13 RRMS patients during IFNB treatment for 3 to 6 months. Conclusions: IFNB elevated immediately the expression of chemokines with relevance to early adverse effects in MS.",

However, despite the well documented efficacy, it remains unclear what mechanisms are involved and how Rebif treatment alters the clinical course of the disease. Methods: For all experiments we used cDNA Affymetrix microarrays (U133A). We analyzed peripheral blood samples from 12 RRMS patients, before and 3 months after initiation of Rebif treatment. Data analysis was performed using t-test, TNoM (Threshold Number of Misclassification) and Info-test. Most informative genes (MIGs) were defined as those with pvalue <0.05 in all 3 statistical tests. Results: Rebif treatment resulted in 890 MIGs. MS pathogenesis-related effects of Rebif include adhesion, inflammation and apoptosis. Rebifinduced adhesion effects were characterized by down-regulation of the integrin genes like ITGA2B, ITGB3, ITGAE and ITGB5. Additionally, LIMS1, CD9, CD44 and SELP gene-transcripts, mediating cell adhesion, and TNFRSF4 that directly affects adhesion of activated T-cells to vascular endothelium, were suppressed. The anti-inflammatory effects of Rebif were mainly related to suppression of IL1 inflammatory-pathways and involved over-expression of IL1RN, and inhibition of CXCL5 and TOLLIP that are involved in IL1 activation. The induced pro-apoptotic pathways included up-regulation of apoptotic inductors like CD38 and BCL2, and caspase activators like CARD4, CASP4 and CASP10. The anti-apoptotic genes like TGFB1, SNCA, GPX1 and IGF1R were down-regulated. Conclusions: Short-term Rebif treatment resulted in immunomodulatory effects related to anti-adhesion effects involving integrin family genes, suppression of IL1-related inflammation and stimulation of apoptosis, all important to control RRMS disease activity.",

We used the Affymetrix GeneChip Focus array with more than 8500 different genes displayed to study changes in gene expression in 10 patients treated with IFN-beta1a (30 \u03bcg intramuscularly once weekly). Blood samples for the study of mRNA expression in purified mononuclear cells (MNC) were drawn before the first injection of IFN-beta1a and 14-20 h after the first injection of IFN-beta1a (T1). After three months of treatment new blood samples were obtained before the injection of IFN-beta (T2) and after the injection of IFN-beta (T3). After the first injection of IFN-beta (T1) the expression of 283 genes differed significantly from baseline values (T0; p < 0.05 with Bonferroni correction). Among 135 up-regulated genes, 57 were induced at least two-fold. Among 148 down-regulated genes, 11 were at least 50% reduced. Gene expression at baseline and T2 did not differ significantly. After three months of treatment with IFN-beta, the injection of IFN-beta resulted in slightly less pronounced changes in gene expression, but there was no significant difference in the gene expression profile at T1 and T3.

We investigated in vitro the ability of Interferon \u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) to affect human Treg function as defined by production of IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2. Treg were isolated from healthy donors' blood by immunomagnetic sorting and cultured. IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 mRNAs and proteins were measured by RT-PCR and ELISA respectively. Incubation with IFN-\u03b2 1000 IU/ml significantly reduced IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 in Treg at both mRNA and protein levels (IL-10: mRNA = \u2212 51.8 \u00b1 12.0%, protein = \u2212 35.3 \u00b1 10.3%; TGF-\u03b2: mRNA = \u2212 42.7 \u00b1 16.7%, protein = \u2212 46.9 \u00b1 17.6%; P < 0.001 vs. control in all cases). As we recently reported that IFN-\u03b2 induces the release of endogenous catecholamines from human lymphocytes, we first measured catecholamines in unstimulated Treg by HPLC-ED: we found elevated intracellular levels comparable to those in activated lymphocytes. We therefore tested whether the effects of IFN-\u03b2 could be antagonized by selective antagonists for dopaminergic or adrenergic receptors: the D1-like receptor antagonist SCH23390 completely reversed the effects of IFN-\u03b2. This is the first report showing a direct effect of IFN-\u03b2 on human Treg function. The effect involves the activation of D1-like receptor pathways, likely through the autocrine/paracrine action of endogenous dopamine released from Treg by IFN-\u03b2 itself. In view of the role or Treg in the regulation of the immune response in health and disease, further studies are urgently needed to assess the clinical significance of these findings. Introduction: Interferon \u03b2-1a (Rebif) is an effective treatment known to reduce disease activity and progression in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Using microarray gene-expression analysis we have recently identified 890 genes that characterize Rebif treatment effects in RRMS. Objective: Analysis of Rebif-induced regulatory pathways in order to further elucidate the hierarchy of biological functions associated with treatment effects in RRMS. Methods: Using an integrative model we classified the 890 genes within the Rebif signature into 23 groups, according to their chromosomal location. For each intra-chromosomal group of genes we reconstructed regulatory pathways, using Bayesian networks and identified their regulating genes. Next, we identified common motifs of transcription factors in the promoter region of these regulating genes. Results: The analysis resulted in 71 intra-chromosomal regulatory pathways, regulated by 110 regulating genes. Analysis of the motifs in the promoter region of the regulatory genes identified 48 transcription factors that added information for identification of interacting biological pathways induced by Rebif in RRMS. An interesting example for a previously unknown mechanism identified is the over-expression of zinc finger CCCH type domain containing 1 gene (ZC3HDC1). ZC3HDC1 was found directly regulate caspase recruitment domain family, member 4 gene (CARD4) that plays a significant role in apoptosis. This suggests that ZC3HDC1 is a regulating Rebif inducible gene that indirectly enhances apoptosis.",

Background: Neurodegeneration correlates with progression of disability in multiple sclerosis (MS). IFN-\u03b21a reduces progression of sustained disability in MS, suggesting neuroprotective properties. BDNF and other neurotrophic factors capable of promoting neural cell survival may contribute to \"neuroprotective immunity\" in MS. Design/methods: For in vitro analyses, mitogen-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) obtained from untreated MS patients or from healthy donors were treated with IFN-\u03b21a. Their proliferative activity was compared to the secretion and transcription of BDNF as assessed by standard ELISA and by real-time PCR. Results: Proliferative activity of mitogen-activated PBL was inhibited by IFN-\u03b21a in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, IFN-\u03b21a induced BDNF expression both in activated and in non-activated PBL. Highest BDNF levels were induced at IFN-\u03b21a concentrations between 1000 and 5000U/ml, whereas higher or lower concentrations induced lower BDNF levels. BDNF mRNA levels, other neurotrophic factors and pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines are currently being investigated. In addition, for ex vivo analyses, serum levels and mRNA levels of BDNF are being assessed in blood obtained from untreated or Rebif-treated MS patients. Conclusions: Our results support the hypothesis that IFN-\u03b21a may promote neuroprotection by induction of BDNF expression.",

Tokyo, Japan; 3 University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan Background: CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cells have suppressive auto-reactive and potent regulatory properties. Especially, CD4 + CD25 +high regulatory T cells (Treg) are anergic to antigenic stimulation and actively downregulate activation. Recently, the transcription factor Foxp3 gene has been implicated as a key element in balancing immune responses and is expressed in CD4 + CD25 + Tr cells. The present study investigates whether Interferon (IFN)-\u03b21b affects the inducing CD4 + CD25 high Treg cells and FOXP3mRNA expression. Method: We studied the frequency of CD4 + CD25 high Treg cells by flow cytometry analysis and the level of expression of FOXP3mRNA by quantitative real-time PCR in peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 18 healthy subjects and 18 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients before and after treating with IFN-\u03b21b. Results: The frequency of CD4 + CD25 high Treg cells and the level of FOXP3 mRNA expression in PBMC showed no difference between healthy subjects and MS patients in the remission phase. The mean percentage of the frequencies of CD4 + CD25 high Treg cells in MS patients for 2 years after IFN-\u03b21b treatment (2.7 \u00b1 2.4%) were slightly higher than before treatment (2.0 \u00b1 1.3%) (not statistically significant). Also an increase FOXP3mRNA expression was observed in MS patients at 3 months after IFN-\u03b21b treatment (3.3 \u00b1 3 .5 fold increases), it showed significantly different compared with before treatment (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that IFN-\u03b21b might have played a role in controlling the auto-reactive T cells through an increased of Treg cells and also its relevance to the treatment of MS.",

The treatment efficacy of IFN-\u03b21b for multiple sclerosis is potentially attributable to the immune regulatory properties of the drugs. Method: We compared the expression of Th1-related CXCR3 chemokine receptors and Th2-related CCR4 chemokine receptors on T cells derived from MS patients and those derived from healthy controls. Also, we have investigated the chemokine receptor expressions in MS patients undergoing IFN-\u03b21b therapy.

Results: The percentage of CXCR3-expressing CD4 + T cells in patients with MS was significantly elevated compared with those of healthy controls. Treatment with IFN-\u03b21b reduced the percentage of CXCR3-expressing CD4 + T cells in both responders and non-responders during the first 12 month.

Another factor is affinity, showing significantly higher affinity values for IFN\u03b2-1a treated patients as compared to patients on IFNb-1b (296 +/\u2212 50.7 vs. 265 +/\u2212 31.5; values obtained by titration of antigen-antibody binding using increasing concentrations of sodium isothiocyanate). The potency of binding antibodies (BAB) to neutralize IFNb is also different among the different preparations. Twelve% of BAB positive patients treated with IFNb-1a i.m. are also NAB positive compared to 51% of IFNb-1a s.c. and 37% of IFNb-1b treated patients (P < 0.0001). These biochemical characteristics contribute to the different abilities of the IFNb preparations to induce NAB and to their different dynamic of NAB development. Consequences for treatment decisions and therapy monitoring will be discussed as well as potential strategies to overcome NAB development or reversion to NAB negativity. In Multiple Sclerosis (MS), oligodendrocyte injury is believed to be caused by an aberrant immune response initiated by autoreactive T cells. Increasing evidence indicates that inflammatory responses in the central nervous system are not exclusively detrimental, but may also exert protective effects. Such protective effects are potentially mediated by the local secretion of neurotrophic factors by immune cells. We previously reported that T cells and monocytes produce leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a member of the neuropoietic family of neurotrophic factors, both in vitro and in inflammatory MS lesions. In the present study, we report a reduced LIF production by CD4 + T cells of relapsing remitting MS patient as compared to secondary progressive MS patients and healthy controls. Furthermore, immunomodulatory agents such as leptin, IFN-\u03b2 and simvastatin were studied for their potential to alter secretion of LIF and other cytokines by T cells and monocytes. Low doses of simvastatin, but not IFN-\u03b2 or leptin enhanced LIF secretion by CD4 + T cells of RR-MS patients, but not in healthy controls. We further demonstrated that LIF did not influence viability, proliferation and cytokine secretion of T cells. Together these data provide new information on the regulation of LIF secretion by immune cells. Further insights into the complex regulation of neurotrophic factors such as LIF may prove useful for treatment of MS.",

T-cell lines can also be generated from healthy subjects. Using microarray analyses we identified a unique autoimmune gene expression fingerprint of MOG-responsive T cell lines with over-expression of IGF-BP3, VEGF, BCL-2 and Lifeguard. This imprint is absent in myelinresponsive T-cell lines from healthy subjects. Over-expression of BCL2 suggested resistance of MS autoreactive lines to apoptosis. We thus protracted T cell exposure to antigen during line selection from the commonly used 16-18 days to \u223c45 days, at which time normal human T cells undergo apoptosis. MS T cell lines generated were 93-99% CD4 + oligoclonal (4-9 TcR V\u03b2 isoforms), IFN\u03b3 producing T cells bearing >90% CD45RO + determinants. We stimulated MOG responsive healthy subject T cell lines with the proinflammatory SDF1\u03b1, TNF\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3. Treated cells expressed higher levels of IGF-BP3, VEGF and BCL-2 genes mimicking the autoimmune fingerprint. Autoimmune fingerprint-bearing lines were insensitive to additional cytokine stimulation. While most P-MS patient lines express the autoimmune fingerprint and cannot be further stimulated, several MBP-reactive lines derived from P-MS bear healthy T cell features. This fingerprint enable distinguishing disease-related from healthy lineages within an MS or P-MS individual and enable better line selection for TCV. T cell lines reactive to synthetic myelin peptides were generated from peripheral blood of probable multiple sclerosis patients (P-MS), within three months of their first demyelinating attack. The attenuated autoreactive cell lines served as T cell vaccines in these patients. We analyzed by Immunoscope the TcR V\u03b2 profiles of these lines. These cell lines were >98% CD4 + and >90% CD45RO + . Oligoclonal compositions of TcR V\u03b2 family isoforms of 21 tested were identified. V\u03b215 was present at a very high frequency in 9 of the 12 T-cell lines (75%) from 5 of the 6 patients (83.3%) which were examined. V\u03b29 occurred in 8 of the 12 T cell lines (66.6%) from 5 of the 6 patients (83.3%) examined. V\u03b27, V\u03b25.1, V\u03b26 and V\u03b221 also occurred in higher frequencies of 50%, 42%, 42% and 30% respectively. It is noteworthy that the combination of V\u03b29,15 was found in 5 of the 12 tested lines and the combination of V\u03b2 6, 7, 15, 21 in 5 other lines. Despite the apparent degenerate nature of the autoreactive TcR there appears to be common denominators in myelin antigens because stimulation of PBMC from these P-MS patients with a tetanus toxin epitope did not stimulate these autoreactive populations. Our findings indicate existence of V\u03b2 clusters in P-MS patients which occur in repetitive combinations. These clusters are evident in T-cell lines generated in response to various myelin antigens within a given patient, irrespective of the nature of the specific antigen.",

A previous pilot trial of T cell vaccination (TCV) with activated CD4 + T cells derived from CSF demonstrated safety, feasibility and immune effects in MS patients. A double-blind placebocontrolled trial was performed with early relapsing-remitting MS patients to study the effects of TCV on disease activity as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Twenty-nine MS patients that demonstrated MRI activity in a pre-entry period of 6 months were randomized into active (TCV) (n = 20) and placebo (n = 9) groups. Three immunisations with irradiated CSF vaccines (5-10 million cells) or placebo were administered subcutaneously with an interval of 2 months. Patients were monitored for 12 months after the final immunisation for MRI activity (every 2 months), clinical scores and immune responses. The vaccinations were well tolerated and no toxicity or adverse effects were reported. Anti-myelin T cell responses were reduced after TCV in 16 out of 20 MS patients. The mean number of active MRI lesions and the volume of active MRI lesions and T2 lesions was reduced in the treated group, but not in the placebo group. These differences were however not statistically significant. The mean EDSS scores remained stable in both groups. Patients with a high immune response to the vaccine cells showed a trend for improved MRI and clinical responses to TCV. Despite the lack of statistically significant differences due to the low patient number, this study further demonstrates safety and feasibility of TCV in MS patients, and suggests that possible therapeutic effects of TCV may be more prominent in patients that show high immune responses to the vaccine.",

PBMC were incubated with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 \u03bcg/ml) for 1 h, and then IVIg (0.1-10 mg/ml) was added for 24 h. Moreover, to study the neutralizing effect of IVIg on MMP-9, PBMC were incubated with LPS (1 \u03bcg/ml) for 24 h, and then IVIg (0.1-10 mg/ml) was added for 1 h. MMP-9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 in the supernatant were measured using ELISA. Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney U test. Result: MMP-9 was significantly higher in the MS group than the control group both in the condition with and without LPS. Although TIMP-1 was up-regulated with LPS in both of the two groups, there was no significant difference between the two groups. The MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio was significantly higher in MS group than the control group. IVIg decreased MMP-9 but not TIMP-1 dose dependently both in the two groups. IVIg decreased the MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio dose dependently both in the two groups. Suppressive effects of IVIg on MMP-9 production were not by neutralizing effects.

Treatment significantly decreased migratory capacity of immune cells, correlating well with changes in VLA-4 expression. Effects of a single dose were not saturating and did not persist through the monthly dose-interval. Infusion effects varied across patients but were remarkably stable within individual patients, over multiple infusions. Treatment significantly modulated proliferative responses of immune cells. Interpretation: We provide first proof-of-concept that in vivo natalizumab diminishes migratory capacity of human immune cells.

Conclusion: The data indicate that BHT-3009 is safe and may suppress immune responses in an antigen-specific manner. Background: Anti-tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (anti-TNF\u03b1) therapy, including infliximab treatment, for rheumatic diseases has been associated with rare cases of new or exacerbated neuroinflammatory disorders such as multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis. In multiple sclerosis, anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy may increase disease activity. There is evidence for an increased peripheral T cell reactivity, measured as enhanced IFN\u03b3 production, during anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy of rheumatoid arthritis. This may potentially provoke neuroinflammation, since systemic IFN\u03b3 administration has been demonstrated to exacerbate multiple sclerosis. We therefore hypothesize that the few cases of clinical neuroinflammatory disorders observed after anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy of rheumatic diseases represents the extreme end of a commonly occurring minor intrathecal immune activation, which in most cases does not give any overt neurological dysfunction. Objective and methods: To test this hypothesis, we determined the expression of IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1 and IL-10 mRNA in cerebrospinal fluid cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the levels of nitric oxide oxidation products in cerebrospinal fluid and serum, the cerebrospinal fluid cell counts and IgG indices, in ten patients with polyarthritis before and during infliximab treatment. Results: No significant signs of intrathecal immune activation were recorded. In the systemic compartment, induction of IFN\u03b3 expression during infliximab treatment was demonstrated. Conclusions: Intrathecal immune activation, as measured by the employed assays, during infliximab therapy is not a common phenomenon and we thereby refute our initial hypothesis. Our finding of increased systemic IFN\u03b3 expression demonstrates that a systemic pro-inflammatory component is part of the diverse effects of anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy.",

Activated T lymphocytes cause injury in a cell contact-dependent non antigen-restricted manner. We hypothesize that statins could offer neuroprotection by down regulating T-cell activation, cell-cell contact-dependent interactions and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression. Methods: Statin-and control-treated peripheral blood lymphocytes were co-cultured with two neuronal (SHSY-5Y and NB-1) and one astrocytic cell line (LN18). Functional antibodies directed against CD147, CD98, HLA-DR and HLA-ABC attenuating T-cell activation were pulsed on T cells and then presented to target cells. Neurons were also incubated with different proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Cell functions were assessed by MTT assay, microscopy, ELISA, FACS and zymography. Results: Neurons were highly susceptible to cytotoxicity caused by activated T cells. Neuronal cell viability was restored when T cells were pretreated with statins (which again was reversed by mevalonate) and also when prepulsed with T-cell activation antibodies (CD147 and CD98 but not HLA-DR and HLA-ABC). Proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines did not promote neuronal apoptosis. Further we observed a decrease in MMP-9 in statin-treated cultures. Cell apoptosis was specific to neuronal cell lines as the astrocytic cell line did not show a similar behaviour. Conclusion: Treatment with statins down regulates cell activation markers which mediate the neuronal insult. Cell death on neurons is to be further reconfirmed by MAP-2 immunoreactivity on neurons and detection of nucleosomes in culture medium. Thus, statins may promote neuroprotective properties in neuroinflammatory disorders such as multiple sclerosis.",

Within the B cell population, mature na\u00efve cells remained the dominant cell type, but memory cells were further decreased, in contrast to the relative dominance of memory cells in the depleted T cell pool. One month after treatment the proportion of transitional type 1 (CD27 \u2212 / CD23 \u2212 ) B cells, the recent bone marrow emigrants, increased dramatically, suggesting they are principally responsible for the reconstitution. Also at one month, serum B cell activating factor (BAFF) increased significantly; but by month three levels had dropped and we observed a switch from T1 to mature na\u00efve B cell phenotype. This is in agreement with published work showing the importance of BAFF in na\u00efve B cell maturation and survival. However, ex vivo neutralisation of BAFF did not alter B cell proliferation in our patients.",

Recent experimental data have shown that Forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) is highly expressed in TR cells and is responsible for their function. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) is constitutively expressed in TR cells; it is responsible for the costimulation of TR cells and the direct suppression of effector T cells.

It has been shown that this coincides with a period of lymphopaenia induced proliferation (LIP). Animal models of autoimmune disease employ LIP to induce susceptibility to disease, suggesting that homeostatic proliferation inherently results in the loss of self tolerance. The treatment of multiple sclerosis offers a unique opportunity to study this phenomenon in humans. We have conducted a survey of all autoimmune diseases arising during the treatment of multiple sclerosis with Campath-1H at our institution. The autoreactivity of lymphocytes prior to and following this treatment was measured by challenging carboxy fluoroscein diacetate succinimidyl ester labelled PBMCs with the putative autoantigens myelin basic protein and thyroid stimulating hormone receptor extracellular domain. We report an incidence of autoimmunity after treatment with Campath-1H of 39%. The incidence was greatest in those patients receiving a single pulse of Campath-1H, a group who were also older and had more advanced multiple sclerosis. A variety of autoimmune conditions have been identified, including organ specific, haematological and systemic autoimmunity; the most prevalent was thyroid autoimmune disease. An eightfold increase in the autoreactivity of lymphocytes emerging during LIP, which resides within the CD4 + T cell compartment, is demonstrated. We hypothesise that this may, at least in part, be responsible for the emergence of autoimmunity in patients undergoing lymphocyte depletion for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.",

According to McDonald's diagnostic criteria for MS, the criteria would best apply to patients between 10 and 59 years of age and special care must be taken in making a diagnosis of MS in those who were younger or older. Although some cases of late-onset MS were reported, clinical characters of late-onset MS were still unknown. Therefore we evaluated characteristics of late-onset MS in our hospital. Methods: Thirty patients with MS admitted to our hospital from April, 1991 to March, 2006 . Late onset is defined as onset after 65 years old and we found out three patients (68-77 years old, one woman and two men). Clinical course and MRI findings of these patients were evaluated. Results: All three patients with late-onset MS underwent relapse and remission. The sites of the lesion were optic nerve and spinal cord in one patient, cerebrum and spinal cord in two patients. All their symptoms were temporarily improved after steroid therapy. Two patients with late-onset MS had poor prognosis, but in one patient, subcutaneous administration of Interferon \u03b21b was effective for preventing relapse for 2.5 years. Conclusion: Characters of late-onset MS were similar to Japanese ordinary type of opticospinal form. Interferon \u03b21b therapy may provide good prognosis in late-onset MS.",

However, many papers, researched psychological interventions for MS, were published, but they did not form any definite conclusions. Methods: We used Beck Depression Inventory (Second Edition). To investigate MS depression, 27 MS patients (7 males, 22 females; 24 relapse and remitting type, 2 secondary progressive type, 3 with clinical isolated syndrome; average age: 43) were compared and categorized or examined with respect to age, depressive score, EDSS, morbidity period, those receiving interferon beta 1b therapy and those who did not, total frequency of relapse, and frequency of relapse the last year. Results: There were no significant differences. Between depressive score and EDSS, numbers of cerebral lesions, total frequency of relapse, frequency of relapse in the last year, among patients with high EDSS. Conclusion: Depressive scores in MS patients not associated with any clinical examination in this study may suggest that depression is not constitutive of the disease.",

Although the activation pattern of the TCR repertoire in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) was similar to that in NMO, secondary progressive MS (SPMS) patients with longer disease durations and higher EDSS scores consistently had a smaller number of clonally expanded V\u03b2s than RRMS patients.

Neuromyelitis optica (NMO), or Devic's disease is a disorder of the demyelinating disease spectrum which involves mainly the optic nerves and the spinal cord within the central nervous system (CNS). Recently, abnormalities of the humoral immune system have been shown in cases with NMO, with an antibody against aquaporin-4. Here we aimed to look for NMO IgG in Turkish cases with Devic's disease in comparison to cases with classical multiple sclerosis (MS) and healthy controls (HC). Serum samples from 14 patients with Devic's disease, 14 cases with MS and 15 HC were assessed using an indirect immunofluorescence kit containing monkey cerebrum, cerebellum, intestinum and HEP2 cells. The sections were assessed blinded to the clinical diagnosis. 8 patients with Devic's disease showed staining around the vessels and pial surfaces in cerebrum and cerebellum sections. On the other hand none of the MS cases or HC showed such a staining. 5 out of 8 positive Devic's showed strong binding, and among these 4 had severe clinical involvement. On the other hand, among the cases with Devic's disease that were negative, 2 had severe disease while 4 had milder forms of the disease. However this difference did not reach statistical significance. This relatively small cohort of patients suggest that the presence of NMO IgG might have an association with the disease course and severity.

We conducted a multicentric study on childhood ADEM, acute transverse myelitis (ATM) and multiple sclerosis (MS) by epidemiologic approach from 1998 to 2003 at Fukuoka Prefecture in southern Japan, where almost 5 million people lived. We identified 38 patients with disseminated demyelination of the central nervous system; 26 with ADEM, 4 with TM and 8 with MS. An estimated incidence of ADEM was 0.64/100,000, median age at onset was 5.7 years, and male-female ratio was 2.3:1. The median age at onset (9.3 years) of MS was significantly higher than that of ADEM. Nineteen patients with ADEM (73%) experienced febrile illnesses within one month before the onset. As a prodromal symptom of ADEM, fever was observed in 73% of patients. Initial symptoms included disturbance of consciousness (50%), motor symptoms (50%), and seizures (31%). Laboratory studies revealed pleocytosis (81%) and protein elevation (34%) in cerebrospinal fluid. Administration of high-dose methylprednisolone was effective (84%). Neurological sequelae such as mild motor disturbance occurred in 30%. Compared with previous reports of ADEM in other countries, the onset age and sex ratio in Japan were similar, but the proportions of fever and seizures were higher. There might be distinct clinical features of ADEM in Asian countries.",

Total RNA was extracted from CE sampled at four, seven, 10, 14, 18, 21, 26 and 32 days post-immunization (DPI; n = 4). Complementary DNA was then analyzed by quantitative PCR for \u03b3\u03b4 TCR and house keeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expressions. The value of \u03b3\u03b4 TCR mRNA products was expressed by the ratio to the value of GAPDH PCR products of the same rat. For FACS analysis, mononuclear cells recovered from the homogenated CE sampled at 13 and 17 DPI (n = 6) were stained by anti-rat CD3-FITC or \u03b3\u03b4 TCR-PE monoclonal antibody. The rats developed EAN at 10 DPI, peaked at 14 to 18 DPI then recovered. \u03b3\u03b4 TCR mRNA was negligible at 0 DPI, increased at 4 DPI only transiently then started to increase at 10 DPI again. It reached the peak at 14-18 DPI then recovered to the basal level by 32 DPI. FACS analysis revealed that \u03b3\u03b4 T cell populations among total T cells in the CE were always higher than those in the other organs (peripheral blood, lymph nodes and spleens) of the same rats. Our data suggest two waves of \u03b3\u03b4 T cell infiltration one of which might be proinflammatory while the other might be anti-inflammatory. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) are involved in inflammatory processes such as Guillain Barr\u00e9 Syndrome and its animal model, Experimental Autoimmune Neuritis (EAN). We have investigated the presence of TNF-\u03b1 and iNOS in peripheral nervous system during EAN. At different stages of the disease, spinal roots adjacent to lumbar intumescence, cauda equina, sensitive ganglia and sciatic nerves were obtained from induced-EAN Lewis rats and processed for double iNOS and TNF-\u03b1 fluorescence immunohistochemistry. Large oval TNF-\u03b1 + cells and smaller rounded TNF-\u03b1 + /iNOS + cells were evidenced. All experimental groups, including the control group showed TNF-\u03b1 + cells around ganglia and in perineurium, with slight differences among groups. At the onset of clinical signs, few TNF\u03b1 + /iNOS + cells were found in blood vessels of cauda equina and sciatic nerve. During the acute phase there has been an increase in the amount of these cells around vessels and inflammatory infiltrates in ganglia, cauda equina and the other spinal roots. Just before the peak stage, TNF-\u03b1 + /iNOS + cells in these regions and in sciatic nerve were widely distributed around numerous infiltrates. In the recovery stage, some TNF-\u03b1 + /iNOS + cells have been still found in cauda equina and sciatic nerve vessels, while in the resolution stage they were not evidenced. Evolution of EAN clinical signs may be related to TNF-\u03b1 and iNOS-immunoreactive cells in different nervous regions. Probably these cells are stimulated to produce TNF-\u03b1 and iNOS simultaneously before reaching peripheral nervous microenvironment. Supported by CAPES, FAPESP.",

The pattern of eNOS expression over the course of EAN largely matched that of caveolin-1. Immunohistochemistry showed that, in EAN lesions, intense caveolin-1 immunostaining was seen in ED1-positive macrophages, as well as intensely in vascular endothelial cells and Schwann cells, which constitutively expressed caveolin-1 in normal sciatic nerves. Consequently, we postulated that caveolin-1 expression increased in the sciatic nerves with EAN, possibly mediating either molecular trafficking and nitric oxide generation partly through the activation of eNOS in vascular endothelial cells and Schwann cells, as well as in inflammatory macrophages in EAN and /or cellular apoptosis of inflammatory cells.

Incubation of SC in vitro with 8-Br-cAMP at high concentration simulates many aspects of axolemmal effects on SC. Neonatal rat SC were incubated with l mM 8-Br-cAMP for 6 and 24 h. RNA was extracted from SC and analyzed with Affymetrix microarray gene chips. These chips contain >28,000 genes. Up or down regulation of expression compared to unstimulated SC was set at very high stringency (p < 0.001). We found changes in expression of many genes including several originally associated with the immune system. At 6 h we observed upregulation for genes for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced protein 6, CD200, cytokineinduced neutrophil chemoattractant-2, CD24, CXCL2 and transforming growth factor (TGF)B-induced transcript 4. Down regulation was noted in the gene for TGFB-induced transcript 1. At 24 h there was upregulation of the genes for CXCR4, integrinB4, hypoxia induced factor (HIF)-la responsive RTP801, HIF-la and TGFB-induced transcript 4. Down regulation was noted for genes for IgG Fc binding protein 1, TNFRSF member 12a (receptor for TWEAK), integrinB, integrinB-binding protein 1 and endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide.

The earliest pathological change is lengthening of the nodes of Ranvier in the ventral roots. Saltatory conduction along the myelinated axons depends on the accumulation of voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels at nodes. Paranodal axo-glial junctions flanking nodes are important for the appropriate ion channel clustering. Nav channel dysfunction may cause the initial motor nerve conduction block in axonal Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. To prove this, we examined nodal lesions in an animal model. By immunizing with gangliosides, rabbits produced anti-GM1 IgG antibodies and developed acute limb weakness with a monophasic course. Electron micrographs showed abnormally lengthened nodes in ventral roots from the paralyzed rabbits. Immunohistochemical studies revealed deposit of IgG, C3 component of complement, and membrane attack complex on the nodes in ventral roots from the rabbits during the acute phase of the illness. GM1 epitope was revealed at the IgGdeposited lesions. The number of affected nodes with complement deposit was reduced during the recovery phase. Clusters of Nav channels, \u03b2IV spectrin (a cytoskeletal protein at nodes), and contactin-associated protein (Caspr; axonal component of the paranodal junction) were altered or disappeared on the abnormally lengthened nodes with complement deposit. Anti-GM1 antibodies mediate complement-dependent destruction of nodes of Ranvier and disrupt Nav channel clusters. These findings confirm the hypothesis that Nav channel dysfunction is responsible for the initial nerve conduction block and consequent motor weakness in axonal Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome.",

Although this epidemiologic information has already been reported in Europe and Oceania, it is little known in Asia. We aimed to clarify the crucial prevalence and incidence rate in Japan and performed a large epidemiologic study throughout Japan. This study covered the whole Japanese population and investigated the number of CIDP patients in combination with each sex, age group (adult and juvenile) and geographic distribution. We investigated the prevalence and incidence number of patients in general and university hospitals with either a department of neurology, internal medicine or pediatrics during November 2004 to August 2005. The number of patients was reported by all hospitals with a department of neurology and by randomly extracted hospitals with internal medicine and pediatrics corresponding to its number of beds. The number of Japanese patients used for the calculation of the prevalence and incidence rate follows the national census of 2005. As a result, we clarify that the annual prevalence rate is 1.91/100,000 and the incidence rate is 0.57/100,000 in Japan, which is very similar to the results in other counties. Additionally, both the prevalence and incidence rate are almost the same in each prefecture throughout Japan. In conclusion, the epidemiology of CIDP shows universality not only from the aspect of ethnic distribution but also geographical distribution worldwide as well as in Japan. Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP) is an autoimmune disease that targets the myelin sheaths in peripheral nerve. The target antigen is unknown and there is no linkage to the major histocompatibility (MHC) locus that is involved in protein antigen presentation. As glycolipid antigens are implicated in other autoimmune neuropathies, we investigated CIDP patients for DNA polymorphisms in CD1A and CD1E, members of the CD1 gene family involved in the processing and presentation of lipid antigens to T-cells. Patients with IgM monoclonal gammopathy (MG) associated neuropathy were also investigated. We found that patients with CIDP (n = 23) were more than twice as likely to have the CD1E 01/01 genotype than normal controls (n = 28) (p < 0.01). A negative association between MG neuropathy (n = 15) and CD1E 01/01 was also observed, but this finding did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.018). The association with CD1E 01/01 implicates immune reactivity to a lipid antigen in the pathogenesis of CIDP. Furthermore, the gene product of CD1E 01 may have a higher affinity for a putative CIDP antigen than other forms of CD1E, or homozygosity may result in higher expression of 01, facilitating antigen presentation, and enhancing susceptibility to disease. This points to the CD1E pathway as a potential target for therapeutics.",

According to our clinical and experimental studies, we proposed the diagnostic criteria of CFS. To confirm the usefulness of the diagnostic criteria, we conducted a Japanese nationwide survey of CFS in 2003. Furthermore, we investigated the efficacy of various treatments for CFS. The estimated number of patients was about 340. Detailed medical questionnaires of 84 CFS patients were obtained (males: 49, females: 35, mean age: 57 years old). Mean duration of illness was 6.7 years, which suggested an improvement in the prognosis of this syndrome. However, mean annual frequency of hospitalization (2.7 times) and absence of any patient showing complete recovery indicated that CFS is still an intractable disease. Polyneuropathy (100%), edema (97%), and skin lesions (95%) were the most frequent manifestations, followed by organomegaly (79%) and endocrine abnormalities (78%). On laboratory examination, M-protein (89%) and high serum VEGF (98%) were detected in these patients. These findings surprisingly resembled the previous Japanese nationwide survey conducted by Nakanishi in 1982, but differed from the report of Dispensieri et al. (2003) done in the USA. According to Dispenzieri's diagnostic criteria, 11% of patients were not correctly diagnosed. Our proposed diagnostic criteria, which includes serum VEGF, correctly diagnosed CFS in all patients. Treatment by peripheral blood stem cell transplantation with high dose chemotherapy was increased and most responded well compared to conventional therapy.",

The prevalence of peripheral neuropathy in MS remains controversial. The aim of this study is to perform an electrophysiological evaluation of the peripheral nervous system in patients with MS. Methods: Subjects were 28 patients with MS, 7 males and 21 females and aged between 21 and 51 (mean 34). Motor conduction study in median, ulnar, peroneal and tibial nerves as well as sensory conduction in median, ulnar, and sural nerves were evaluated. Results: There was electrophysiological evidence of peripheral nervous system lesions in at least one nerve in 9 patients. Low compound muscle action potential was noted in 5 patients. Low sensory nerve action potential was noted in 1 patient. Slowed motor and/or sensory conduction velocity or prolonged distal latency was noted in 2 patients. Two patients had a history of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. One patient was diagnosed as having chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy as well as MS. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the peripheral nerve involvement in patients with MS. Further investigations are needed to clarify the immunological background affecting both central nervous system and peripheral nerves. Objectives: To investigate the frequency of MS-CIDP association, and its correlation with clinical profiles. Methods: Consecutive 59 patients with MS and 61 patients with CIDP were studied. Results: Clinical evident association of the two disorders was found in the two patients (3% of the MS patients and 3% of the CIDP patients). In the two patients, MS preceded CIDP by 2 years and activity of the two diseases appeared to be parallel. Nerve conduction studies showed demyelination in the intermediate nerve segments without involvement of the distal nerve terminals. Another MS patient presented subclinical nerve conduction abnormalities suggestive of intermediate demyelination. Conclusions: The frequency of MS and CIDP association is approximately 3%. CIDP associated with MS is characterized by multifocal demyelination in the nerve trunk and no involvement of the distal nerve terminals. Myelin components common to the central and peripheral nervous systems may be target molecules in such cases.",

The long term use of high doses of these immunosuppressants is however limited due to their severe side effects: bone marrow suppression, hair loss, upset stomach and development of hemorrhagic cystitis. In order to assess the beneficial effect of short term treatment with lower doses of the alkylating immunosuppressive drug Cyclophosphamide (CY) on the development of a preclinical model of GBS and CIDP, the experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN) in Lewis rats, a single dose of CY was administered to the animals 14 days post-immunization. The data obtained in our experiment shows that a single low dose administration of CY was highly effective in preventing clinical signs of EAN. These data suggest that CY deserves further consideration for its use in the treatment of both acute and chronic autoimmune peripheral neuropathies. In particular, since the acute phase of human GBS is usually ranging between 2 and 4 weeks, it is possible that one single administration of the drug would be sufficient to influence the course of the disease, thus avoiding the well known side and toxic effects provoked by prolonged exposure to CY.",

Variant type Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (V-GBS) patient's serum has miniature endplate potential (MEPP) frequency increase (MFI; so-called \u03b1-latrotoxin like effect) with anti-ganglioside antibodies, and these correlate to clinical symptoms. Mechanism of MFI is speculated as complement dependent nerve terminal destruction by autoantibody. The autoantibody and complement make membrane attack complex and create a lot of pores on the nerve terminal membrane. At first, the Ca + inflow and concentrate gain increase MEPP frequency. Thereafter, too much Ca + concentration gain injures the nerve terminal, resulting in disappearance of MEPP at the end. We were able to confirm this process on the mouse diaphragm, and we tried immunoglobulin (Ig) and prednisolone (PSL) treatment to this in vitro model. We chose a V-GBS patient whose serum had high MFI and anti-ganglioside antibodies. We prepared a C 57 BL/6J mouse diaphragm preparation bathed in the patient's serum (0.5 cc) and recorded MEPP using conventional grass microelectrode technique. We added immunoglobulin (Ig), prednisolone (PSL) or both of them to the patient's serum. There was complete suppression of MFI when we used 10 mg/ml Ig or 1 mM PSL. 2 or 5 mg/ml Ig did not completely suppress MFI. MEPP frequency increase was not suppressed by 0.1 mM PSL, but the appearance of the MEPP lost fibers was suppressed. One mg/ml Ig and 0.01 mM PSL did not influence the patient's serum action. Although the Ig was effective when the standard clinical dosage was used, 10 times the standard clinical dosage was necessary for make PSL effective. To confirm the synergistic effect of Ig and PSL, we used patient's serum containing the 0.1 mM PSL and 2 or 5 mg/ml Ig. However, there was no complete MFI suppression. We could not confirm usefulness of the Ig and PSL combination therapy by this in vitro model. 1 Kitasato University, Sagamihara, Japan; 2 The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; 3 Institute of Animal Reproduction, Kasumigaura, Japan; 4 Japan Red Cross Hospial, Tokyo, Japan; 5 Nationall Hospital Organization, Nagoya Med Center, Nagoya, Japan",

Those factor-producing cells were also abundantly detected in the hyperplastic myasthenic thymi (H-MG-thymi). AChR (+) cells and myogenin (+) cells were in a subset of them, suggesting that 100-K (+)/AChR (+) double positive cells are matured myoid cells, whereas 100-K (+)/AChR (\u2212) single positive cells their precursors. Numeral increases of myoid cells occurred at precursor stages, followed by concurrent production of large amounts of AChR and growth factors that may affect the AChR specific breakage of the anergic state. 80-K/100-K appear to be a useful hallmark for understanding the immunological state of H-MG-thymi. However, little is known about the mechanisms of development of myoid cells that produce those factors, although recent studies on skeletal muscle development suggested that biglycan, decorin and other factors such as Pax3/7 are differentially expressed in embryonic and fetal myoblasts. In the present report, we use different types of myoid cells cloned from mice and rats, and hyperplastic thymic tissues to correlate between the regulatory factors and the growth factor production. We found Pax3 and 100-K in H-MG-thymi and marked immunostimulatory roles of 80-K/100-K purified from H-MG-thymi.

Thymic abnormalities such as hyperplasia and thymoma are found in most MG patients. Here, we report that modified acetylcholinesterase (AChE) gene expression and properties are involved in these thymic pathologies. Microarray analysis demonstrated attenuation of the general decrease in gene expression, which is characteristic of adult human thymus, in patients with MG-induced thymic hyperplasia. This was accompanied by reduced expression of DNA replication-associated transcripts and by reduced levels of the \"synaptic\" AChE-S mRNA. Thymic extracts from MG patients further presented elevated amounts but reduced hydrolytic activities of the MG-induced AChE-R variant as compared with adult controls, accompanied by translocation of both AChE-R and the signaling protein kinase PKC-\u03b2II from the cytoplasmic to the membrane-associated fraction. To explore possible causal association of the modified AChE splicing pattern with thymic composition and function, we employed up-regulation of specific thymic AChE variants TgR mice overexpressing human (h)AChE-R and TgS mice overexpressing the membrane-associated (h)AChE-S variant. Both showed smaller thymic medulla than strain-matched FVB/N controls, suggesting differentiation imbalances. Intriguingly, TgS mice displayed smaller thymus weight, CD3 + -high mature cell fractions with higher rate of spontaneous apoptosis as compared with controls. In contrast, TgR mice showed heavier thymuses, selectively enlarged CD4 + CD8 + fractions and protection of cultured thymocytes from apoptosis. Together, the overexpression of AChE-R variant could explain the higher number of thymocytes in both the transgenic model and the human thymus associated with myasthenia gravis.",

With this new method of sandwich ELISA using the complex of anti-RyR monoclonal antibody and native form of RyR from rabbit striate muscle as the target antigen, we measured titers of the autoantibody to RyR from serum samples of 80 patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), 34 disease controls and 23 normal subjects. When titers that exceeded the average + 3 \u00d7 standard deviation of normal samples was defined as the positive, 31 patients with MG (39%) turned to be positive. On the other hand, all samples from the disease and normal controls were negative. The positive rate was significantly high in aged and in thymoma-associated patients. Furthermore, it tended to be high in female and in patients with the generalized MG. In spite of no detection of antibodies to RyR from the samples without antibodies to acetylcholine receptor, there was no correlation with these two autoantibodies. These results suggest that our new method is useful to detect anti-RyR antibodies and is expected as the method to recognize the pathophysiological condition of each myasthenic patient with this antibody.",

However its long term effect has not been sufficiently evaluated. Objective: To assess the long term effect of infrasternal mediastinoscopic thymectomy (IMT) and compare with transsternal thymectomy (TT) in myasthenia gravis (MG) patients. Methods: Among 41 MG patients who underwent thymectomy in our institute between January 1997 and December 2000, 16 patients who received IMT and 17 who received TT were enrolled in this study. QMG score and antiacetylcholine receptor antibody (anti-AChR) titer were evaluated before and 5 years after the surgery. Intracellular cytokine of peripheral blood CD4 \u2212 positive T cells were analyzed by flowcytometry in 9 patients who underwent IMT, and IFN\u03b3/IL-4 ratio was calculated. Results: After 5 years, QMG score reduced from 6.9 to 1.9 (p < 0.01) in IMT group and 7.5 to 2.5 (p < 0.01) in TT group. Anti-AChR titer reduced from 68.6 to 40.0 (p = 0.048) in IMT group and 201.1 to 106.2 (p = 0.017) in TT group. IFN\u03b3/ IL-4 ratio increased from 9.40 to 22.28 (p = 0.039). Conclusion: IMT is as effective as TT, and it is considered to be suitable for MG. IMT seemed to alleviate MG symptoms by correcting the Th2 shift.",

Objectives: To investigate whether E-C coupling of muscle is impaired in patients with generalized myasthenia gravis (MG). Methods: A total of 51 patients with MG were studied. Compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) of the abductor pollicis brevis, and movement-related potentials using an accelerometer placed at the thumb tip were recorded after median nerve stimulation at the wrist. The E-C coupling time (ECCT) was estimated by a latency difference between CMAP and movement-related response. Antibodies against ryanodine receptor (RyR) and muscle specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK), as well as acetylcholine receptor, were measured by immunoassays. Results: Compared with age-matched normal controls (n = 31), the mean ECCT was longer in patients with MG (p = 0.01). ECCT had no significant correlation with clinical severity, disease duration, and anti-RyR or MuSK antibodies, whereas the mean ECCT was shorter for patients treated with FK506 than for those not receiving this treatment (p = 0.03). Conclusions: In MG, E-C coupling appears to be impaired, possibly contributing to additional muscle weakness. FK506 may facilitate E-C coupling in MG patients.",

Tacrolimus is authorized for treatment of myasthenia gravis (MG) in Japan, and can result in a reduced requirement for steroids. We have used tacrolimus for 12 patients with severe MG who had experienced an MG-related crisis episode, and observed these patients for more than two years. Just after the critical attack, the patients were treated using plasmapheresis, then with methylprednisolone(mPSL) pulse therapy, and tacrolimus was started during gradual tapering of PSL. Four of the 12 patients received this course of treatment as their initial therapy, whereas the other eight patients had previously undergone treatment without tacrolimus, but had experienced crisis episodes several years after treatment. Five control patients were treated with immunosuppressants other than tacrolimus, such as azathioprine (AZP) or mizoribine; two of these patients were initially treated with AZP but were then changed to tacrolimus after the crisis. Patient response was evaluated based on the MG-ADL scale, the anti-acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR) antibody titer and the serum tacrolimus level. All tacrolimus-treated patients showed an improved MG-ADL scale and required a lower corticosteroid dose, in parallel with an increase in serum tacrolimus concentration, however, the anti-AChR titer did not decrease significantly. These results suggest that, tacrolimus is a potent tool for treatment of MG, even in severely affected patients; tacrolimus is at least as effective as other immunosuppressants and does not show any side effects, although it failed to prevent relapse due to fatigue or infection.",

To assess the incidence of MuSK-MG systematically, we collected sera from 21 different countries in Europe and Asia, from four USA centers and from three Canadian centers. Of the 788 sera negative for AChR antibodies, 201 were positive for MuSK antibodies giving an overall positivity of 25.5%.

This disease is sometimes associated with interstitial pneumonia (IP), which leads to a poor prognosis of the patients. To find out the clinical marker suggestive of associated IP in DM, we investigated intracellular cytokines and surface antigens of peripheral blood lymphocytes using flow cytometry. Methods: Thirteen patients with active DM with (n = 8, mean age 42.5 \u00b1 15.4 yr) or without IP (n = 5, mean age 52.4 \u00b1 24.9 yr) were enrolled in this study. Nine healthy subjects (mean age 41.3 \u00b1 16.0 yr) were used as a control. After separation of mononuclear cells using the Ficoll-Hypaque method, we performed flow cytometry in order to investigate intracellular cytokines and surface antigens, particularly activation markers of lymphocytes. Results: Both DM patients with and without IP showed significant decreases in CD8 + CD25 + (p < 0.05), CD4 + IFN-\u03b3 + (p < 0.05) and CD4 + IL-4 + (p < 0.05) cells and a significant increase in the CD4 + IL-4 + /CD4 + IFN-\u03b3 + ratio (p < 0.05) compared with controls. There was no significant difference in these subpopulations between DM patients with and these without IP. CD8 + IFN-\u03b3 + lymphocytes were significantly decreased in DM patients with IP than those without IP (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Both helper and cytotoxic T cells are activated in the peripheral blood of patients with active DM. CD8 + IFN-\u03b3 + (Tc1) lymphocytes in the peripheral blood may be a key marker suggestive of associated IP in DM.",

Immunization with partially purified skeletal myosin induced severe experimental autoimmune myositis (EAM) in Lewis rats. However, further purified myosin showed only poor myositogenisity and C-protein, a minor component of crude myosin fraction, had strong myositogenisity. To obtain a sufficient dose of the protein, we generated four recombinant C-proteins (SC1-SC4) covering the entire molecule. In addition, we synthesized twelve SC2 overlapping peptides (P1-P12) to identify epitopes for T and B cells. Although all four SC fragments induced EAM, SC2 showed the strongest myositigenisity. Immunopathological examinations revealed that the main feature of SC2induced EAM was the infiltration of T cells and macrophages and that CD8 + T cells infiltrated the muscle at the early stage. Epitope analysis demonstrated that T cells isolated from SC2-immunized rats responded to P5 and that antisera were reactive to P3, P7 and the conformational epitope(s) of the SC2 molecule. Although it was reported that pothogenic T cells were the main effector in human PM, immunization of P5 that contains T cell epitopes failed to induce EAM. On the other hand, intramuscular injection of anti-SC2 mAb induced mild but definite inflammation. These findings suggest that T cell activation is not sufficient to induce EAM and that autoantibodies play an important role in the development of EAM. We also generated recombinant cardiac C-protein fragments (CC1-CC4) and induced experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAC) for comparison with EAM. In CC2-induced EAC, the proliferative response of T cells to CC2 overlapping peptides was not detected, whereas antibodies against various peptides were generated. These findings strongly suggest the importance of the autoantibody generation in autoimmune muscle diseases.",

Moreover, there is the evidence that IFN-\u03b1 can lead the differentiation of the dendritic cells (DCs), that are the most potent antigen-presenting cells, playing a pivotal role of induction of the immune response. This study examines whether or not IFN-\u03b1 and DCs play important roles in pathogeny of inflammatory muscle disorders such as sarcoidosis and polymyositis (PM). The sera of sarcoidosis contained high amounts of IFN-\u03b1, CXCL10/IP10, and interleukin (IL)12p40, while the sera of PM contained moderate amounts of CXCL10/IP10 and IL12p40, in comparison with other neurological disorders (OND) as measured by ELISA. The skeletal muscles in sarcoidosis contained considerable amounts of IFN-\u03b1 and CXCL10/IP10, while PM and OND had little or no elevation of them as measured by real time RT-PCR. Notably, numerous DC-LAMP-positive cells, that had the specific marker for mature DCs, accumulated in epithelioid granulomas of sarcoidosis, whereas PM and OND had little or no DC-LAMP-positive cells by means of immunohistochemistry. These mature DCs produced Th1-chemokine CXCL10/IP10 in close proximity to CXCR3 positive cells. These results define the highly specialized maturation state of DCs, that could lead to the Th1-skewed condition, in regard to the formation of sarcoid granulomas. Several TLR stimulants can produce high amounts of IFN-\u03b1 via the activation of plasmacytoid DCs. We point out the existence of a natural alliance between IFN-\u03b1 and DCs development, instrumental for ensuring an efficient connection between innate and adaptive immunity.",

All patients presented with symptoms compatible with anti-Ri associated PNS. Oligoclonal bands were detected by isoelectric focusing. Ri-specific affinity blotting was used to assess Ri-specific bands in serum and CSF. Results: In 4/5 CSF samples reactivity of IgG bands with recombinant Ri antigen was found. In one patient with absence of oligoclonal bands of total IgG in CSF, anti-Ri-specific oligoclonal bands were detected with the same sample indicating a higher sensitivity of Ri-specific affinity blotting as compared to affinity blotting with anti-human IgG antibodies.

Anti-Voltage-gated potassium channel antibodies (VGKC-Abs) have recently been reported in some cases of reversible LE. VGKC-Absassociated LE is potentially treatable encephalitis that can be diagnosed by a serological test. Objectives: To assess anti-VGKC Abs prevalence rate of LE patients in Japan, we did radioimmunoassay with 125 I-alfa-dendrotoxin (aDTX). We also evaluated the electrophysiological influence of anti-VGKC antibodies of LE patients. Methods: Sera were obtained from consecutive 20 LE patients, consecutive 20 acquired neuromyotonia (NMT) as positive controls, and 20 healthy controls. Serum VGKC-Abs titers were measured by radioimmunoassay using whole rabbit-brain homogenate and 125 I-aDTX. IgG were purified with HiTrap ProteinG and HiTrap Desalting column for following electrophysiological study (patch-clamp). To study the effect of the patients' IgG on the electrical properties of NB-1, we cultured the cells with 5 \u03bcg/ml IgG from the patients or controls for 3 days. In K + current recording, cells were held at the holding potential of \u2212 80 mV, and square pulses (300 ms duration) between \u2212 140 and +60 mV (20 mV steps) were applied at 15 s intervals. Results: Nine of twenty LE patients had anti-VGKC Abs. There was no difference of clinical features between anti-VGKC Abs positive and negative LE. Anti-VGKC Abs of NMT suppressed potassium cation currents on NB-1 cell; meanwhile Abs of LE did not. CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference of clinical presentation between anti-VGKC associated LE and not associated LE. Anti-VGKC Abs of LE patients did not suppress potassium cation currents on NB-1.

The patients present mostly with peripheral nerve hyperexcitability (neuromyotonia with muscle cramps and fasciculations), with central nervous system involvement (limbic encephalitis with memory loss and seizures), or with combinations of these and autonomic symptoms (Morvan's syndrome with additional sleep, cardiac and gut dysfunction). The antibodies are detected by radioimmunoprecipitation of 125 I-dendrotoxin labeled VGKCs extracted from mammalian brain tissue, and their titers range between 100 and 7000 pM. Since dendrotoxin binds to VGKCs Kv 1.1, 1.2 and 1.6, it is not clear whether the patients' antibodies bind to distinct Kv subtypes, and whether the antibody specificities correlate with the different clinical syndromes. We have characterized the antibodies by binding to different parts of the nervous system, comparing with commercial antibodies to the various Kv1 subtypes. We found that IgG antibodies in patients with limbic encephalitis co-localise with antibodies to Kv1.1 in peripheral nerve, spinal cord, cerebellum and the hippocampus, whereas antibodies in patients with neuromyotonia mainly co-localise with Kv1.2 in these tissues. A few patients have antibodies co-localising additionally or exclusively with Kv1.6. These results have been confirmed on cell lines expressing the individual VGKC subtypes. The results suggest for the first time that the clinical expression of VGKC-antibody associated diseases correlates with antibodies specific for a VGKC subtype, and will inform further experimental studies. A set of cancer and systemic autoimmune diseases is accompanied by an autoantibody response to nucleolar protein B23/nucleophosmin. Probably the appearance of B23 autoantibodies is induced by a unique B23 conformation in tumor cells. Thus, it has been demonstrated that the unique B23 conformation in liver tumor likely results from an N-terminal truncation of B23 present in tumor hepatocytes that forms SDS-stable, GB-sensitive oligomers (Ulanet D.B. et al., PNAS 2003, 100, 12361-12366) . We established the structural state of nucleophosmin in different human tumor cells (HeLa, NGP, Hep G2, Jurkat, OSA) and normal mouse tissues (brain, lung, kidney, liver). The SDS-stable oligomeric forms of nucleophosmin were observed exclusively in the tumor lysates. Interestingly, the number of SDS-stable oligomers and their electrophoretic mobilities were different in examined cells. We have also defined the character of N-terminal truncation in HeLa cells.

Previously, we showed that anti-gliadin antibodies in celiac disease bind to synapsin I, a neuronal phosphoprotein involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release. In this study, we sought to further characterize the immune cross-reactivity by determining the epitopes of synapsin I involved in the interaction with antigliadin antibodies. Antibodies were affinity-purified from pooled sera of multiple gliadin-immunized rabbits by column chromatography. The reactive epitopes of synapsin I were mapped by assessing the binding of purified antibody to arrays of overlapping human synapsin Ia/Ib peptides synthesized on cellulose membrane. The designed peptides were 14mers, with an offset of 6 amino acids each. Major immunoreactive epitopes were found to be located in the C domain of synapsin I, corresponding to sections of the protein that are surface-exposed and directed away from the plane of dimerization. These epitopes also form part of the domains shown to have a role in mediating the interaction between synapsin and synaptic vesicles by penetrating into the lipid membrane. The findings in this study suggest that synaptic uptake of anti-gliadin antibodies that bind synapsin I may have a deleterious effect on the regulation of neurotransmitter release, and might be involved in the pathogenesis of the neurologic manifestations of gluten sensitivity.",

One of the major functions of IL-6 is the stimulation of neutrophils. It has been reported that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) IL-6 is increased in progressive neuro-Behcet's disease (BD). Here we aimed to assess any relationship of CSF IL-6 with long term prognosis of neuro-BD. A total of 68 patients (43 males) with BD and various forms of neurological symptoms were included: 13 had primary headache disorders, 40 had parenchymal neuro-BD, 10 had dural sinus thrombosis, and 5 had stroke. Serum and CSF IL-6 levels were assessed by ELISA. There was no significant difference in serum levels of IL-6. Mean CSF IL-6 levels (pg/ ml) were, 4.9, 15.6, 84.3, and 12.1 in the groups with headache, sinus thrombosis, parenchymal neuro-BD and stroke, respectively (p < 0.01). IL-6 levels were increased if the patient was examined at an acute attack, and were correlated with CSF cell counts and total protein levels. When the patients that were independent after at leas 3 years were compared to those that were dead or dependent, increased IL-6 levels were found in the second group; however patients with an elevated CSF cell/protein level at the acute stage also had significantly higher rate of long term disability (p < 0.05). Although elevated CSF IL-6 levels seem to be related to long term disability, still CSF cell/protein levels seem to be good markers, cheap and easy to perform.",

Itoyama b a Miyagi National Hospital, Miyagi, Japan; b Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan Sweet disease is a multisystem inflammatory disorder characterized by painful raised erythematous plaques and aseptic neutrophilic infiltration of various organs. Skin biopsies reveal deep dermal infiltration of mature neutrophils and absence of vasculitis. Sweet disease responds to systemic corticosteroids. We reported cases of Sweet disease with neurologic manifestations as neuro-Sweet disease (NSD), and proposed a criteria for the diagnosis. Cases with benign, but frequently recurrent encephalitis or meningitis accompanied by autopsy verified-Sweet's erythematous plaques without Behcet's mucocutaneous lesions are classified as \"Probable NSD\" in the criteria. In neuron-Sweet disease both sexes of ages 30 to 70 years are affected. Any region of the CNS can be involved. There is a strong human leukocyte antigen-B54/Cw1 association. Systemic corticosteroids are highly effective for most of the neurologic manifestations. We identified 34 \"probable\" cases so far. \"Possible NSD\" in the criteria included HLA-B54/ Cw1-positive encephalitis or meningitis without erythematous plaques. Analysis of 7 such cases revealed that the encephalitis or meningitis were also generally benign especially compared with a relative disorder, neuro-Behcet disease with HLA-B51. Abnormalities on MRI markedly improved in most of the cases after treatment with systemic corticosteroids. It may be more acceptable to tentatively diagnose these cases as \"HLA-B54/Cw1positive benign recurrent encephalomeningitis\", if it is inadequate to diagnose cases without Sweet's erythematous plaques as NSD. Background: Anti-tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (anti-TNF\u03b1) therapy, including infliximab treatment, for rheumatic diseases has been associated with rare cases of new or exacerbated neuroinflammatory disorders such as multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis. In multiple sclerosis, anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy may increase disease activity. There is evidence for an increased peripheral T cell reactivity, measured as enhanced IFN\u03b3 production, during anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy of rheumatoid arthritis. This may potentially provoke neuroinflammation, since systemic IFN\u03b3 administration has been demonstrated to exacerbate multiple sclerosis. We therefore hypothesize that the few cases of clinical neuroinflammatory disorders observed after anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy of rheumatic diseases represents the extreme end of a commonly occurring minor intrathecal immune activation, which in most cases does not give any overt neurological dysfunction. Objective and methods: To test this hypothesis, we determined the expression of IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1 and IL-10 mRNA in cerebrospinal fluid cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the levels of nitric oxide oxidation products in cerebrospinal fluid and serum, the cerebrospinal fluid cell counts and IgG indices, in ten patients with polyarthritis before and during infliximab treatment. Results: No significant signs of intrathecal immune activation were recorded. In the systemic compartment, induction of IFN\u03b3 expression during infliximab treatment was demonstrated. Conclusions: Intrathecal immune activation, as measured by the employed assays, during infliximab therapy is not a common phenomenon and we thereby refute our initial hypothesis. Our finding of increased systemic IFN\u03b3 expression demonstrates that a systemic pro-inflammatory component is part of the diverse effects of anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy.",

Western blotting analysis shown that in males and females the decrease in the level of TH was observed within 1-21 days following intoxication, achieving minimal level between 3 and 7 time-points. However, at the early time-points, males showed greater reduction in striatal TH versus females. In contrast to the aged mice, in young males and females, between 14 and 21 days post intoxication we noticed a gradual increase in TH concentration. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the increases in expression of TNFa, IL-1b and IFNg genes post intoxication were faster in both young and aging males than females. In aged and young males we observed maximal increase in TGFb 1 after 1-day post intoxication. In contrast, in young and aged females TGFb 1 was elevated at later time-points.

Involvement of the brain-derived, innate immune system components such as microglia and complement proteins seems to be established in the last two decades. On the other hand, significance of the acquired immune system, where T cells play a central role, has yet to be unveiled or, even, hardly investigated. We here report the occurrence of T cells in the substantia nigra (SN) of patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). In the SN of many DLB patients, a number of melanin positive cells still remain and active neurodegenerative processes are seen even at the time of death. Immunohistochemistry for CD3 has revealed that more T cells than controls are present in the blood vessels and brain parenchyma in the SN of many, but not all, DLB patients. The number of T cells was not related with the degree of systemic inflammation at the agonal stage or with the number of T cells in the hippocampus of the same patient. Relationship to the degree of alpha-synuclein accumulation was not evident. Our results suggest that a small number of T cells enter the substantia nigra if the process of neurodegeneration is vigorous and microglia is highly activated.

Using a murine model of focal cerebral ischemia we have recently shown accumulation of large numbers of IL-1\u03b2 mRNA-expressing and IL-1\u03b2 immunoreactive cells in the periphery of the infarct. This might reflect induction of IL-1\u03b2 in resident microglia, recruitment of blood-borne IL-1\u03b2 producing cells, presumably blood-borne macrophages or a combination thereof (Clausen et al., 2005) . To address this question, we generated green flourescens protein (GFP + ) bone marrow chimeric mice. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Cell counting revealed thousands of donoer-derived GFP + cells within the infarct and peri-infarct 24 h after MCA occlusion, most of these cells displayed a round or elongated morphology and expressed the microglial-macrophage antigen Mac-1. At this time of observation, no bone marrow-derived cells had transformed into ramified microglial-like cells. Triple-immunofluorescent analysis showed that IL-1\u03b2 protein was located only to infiltrating a small proportion of infiltrating blood-borne macrophages (Mac-1 + GFP + Mac-1 + GFP + ) within the infarct and peri-infarct and to activated resident microglia (Mac-1 + GFP \u2212 ) in the peri-infarct expressed IL-1\u03b2 protein after 24 h of permanent MCA occlusion. At the same time, very few activated microglia (Mac-1 + GFP \u2212 ) located in the periphery of the infarct synthesised IL-1\u03b2 + protein.",

SP-D is present in the circulation, synthesized by endothelial cells and macrophages, and has pro-atherogenic effects in mice. To investigate whether SP-D also plays a role in stroke-induced infarction or in the secondary ischemia-induced inflammatory responses, we subjected SP-D knockout and wildtype (WT) mice to permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (pMCAO). In this model, the acute infarction, results in breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and a predictable microglial-macrophage-reaction. Comparison of mean infarct volumes after 24 h survival revealed no distinction between the knockout and the WT mice. Quantitative PCR showed an ischemia-induced upregulation of the mRNA levels of IL-1beta and TNF which, however, was similar in knockout and WT mice. Immunohistochemical analysis for microglial-macrophage Mac-1 showed activation of microglia and macrophage infiltration into infarct and peri-infarct in both groups of mice. The data suggest that SP-D has no effect on ischemia-induced brain injury and neuroinflammation at 24 h after surgery.

The main purpose of the study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory action of conditioned media (CM) of ischemic neurons in cerebral ischemia. In the study, protective effect of neuron-derived CM was determined both in vivo and in vitro. The CM was collected from a neuronal culture deprived with glucose, oxygen and sera (in vitro ischemia) for 6 h. At the end of 90 min bilateral common carotid artery occlusion plus unilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion (CCAO/MCAO) CM was injected directly into the ischemic brain of S.D. rat followed by 24 h reperfusion. Brain infarct size was then determined. CM-mediated protection of ischemic microglia, astrocytes and neurons were also determined in vitro based on the survival rate, phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK), expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nitric oxide (NO) release of these cells with or without CM. Results showed that CM significantly reduced the infarct size of ischemic brain and increased survival of ischemic brain cells of all three types. Ischemia-induced iNOS expression and NO release were suppressed by CM in ischemic microglia and astrocytes but not neurons. On the contrary, ERK phosphorylation was further increased by CM in all three cell types. These results indicate ischemia-induced brain inflammation and cell death could be prevented by ischemic neuron-derived CM that further suggests a therapeutic value of this CM in future control of cerebral ischemia.",

A short (3 min) cerebral ischemia as well as a three-minute ischemia followed by a second lethal ischemia enhanced the expression of EP2 and EP4 receptors in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus. In tolerance-acquired CA1 neurons, the immunoreactivities of EP2 and EP4 were upregulated after 4 h and 12 h, respectively. The immunoreactivities were most prominent at three days, and were sustained for at least 14 days, consistent with the results of immunoblotting experiments. In contrast, immunoreactivities for these PGE 2 receptors increased in reactive glial cells in the vulnerable CA1 and hilar regions of rats subjected to the lethal ischemia without ischemic preconditioning. Most of the EP2 immunoreactivity occurred in microglial cells and some astrocytes, whereas increased immunoreactivity for EP4 occurred only in astrocytes. These data suggest that ischemia and induction of ischemia-tolerance have different regulatory effects on the expression of EP2 and EP4 receptors, and that PGE 2 may exert its unique pathophysiological functions in relation to delayed neuronal death and ischemic tolerance induction in the rat hippocampus via specific PGE 2 receptors.

Recently, an increasing body of evidence suggests that OPN may play a defining role in the pathogenesis of acute neuroinflammation. Moreover, OPN induction has been detected in a set of macrophages after focal and global forebrain ischemia and it suggests that OPN may play a key cytokine in tissue repair and remodeling within the central nervous system. We have investigated here, using in the semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis, in situ hybridization histochemistry and immunohistochemistry, the spatiotemporal expression of OPN in the rat hippocampus following transient forebrain ischemia. Ischemia-induced OPN mRNA and protein expression appeared in a subset of microglial cells as early as 1 d, and then reached a peak at 3 d postischemia, and returned to basal levels at 7 d. However, at 10 days, OPN expression in the hippocampal CA1 region re-increased in some reactive astroglial cells, and was sustained for 14 d. Expression of OPN in the reactive astrocyte from 10 d post-ischemia is significant results as compared with established papers. These data suggest that OPN may play a key role as a chemotactic factor for astrocytes and microglial cells. In vivo imaging of phagocytic cells is gaining interest for the study of various pathologies in which they are critically involved, such as neurodegenerative diseases, brain tumors, and stroke. We present here the first MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) data obtained in mice with focal cerebral ischemia, showing in vivo labeling of phagocytes with ultrasmall superparamagnetic particles of iron oxide (USPIO). USPIO-enhanced MRI kinetic analysis unravelled an inflammatory response surrounding the ischemic lesion as well as in the contralateral hemisphere through the corpus callosum. These imaging data were correlated with histochemical analysis showing inflammation remote from the lesion and ingestion of nanoparticules by microglia/macrophages. This study shows that MR-tracking of phagocytic cells is feasible in mice, which may have central therapeutic implications in light of the potential neurotoxicity of activated microglia/ macrophages during central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Toll-like receptors (TLR) have an essential role in response to microbial agents and induction of inflammatory responses. Recent reports have indicated that TLRs, such as TLR2 and TLR4 could also regulate inflammatory and immune responses by endogenous stimuli. In this study, we suggest that TLR2-dependent inflammation can be induced by the endogenous stimulation caused by the physical injury in a mouse brain. We used the stab wound method using a stereotaxic injector with a 26-G of disposable syringe to injure the brain physically. The glial cells of the wild type mouse brain were activated by the stab wound as the results of immunostaining for GFAP and CD11-b. However, in the TLR2 knock out mouse, the activation of glia was down regulated than in wild type. The same result was shown on the mRNA expression for GFAP and CD11-b after stab wound in the brain. The induction of the genes was decreased in the brain of TLR2 knock out mice. These results briefly indicate TLR2 has a role in mediating inflammatory responses to endogenous factors in a mouse brain. To investigate the influence of ONTDs on the patterns of glial differentiation, ONTDs were induced by surgery using Hamburger and Hamilton stage 18 or 19 chick embryos. The spinal cord tissues on postoperative days (POD) 5, 7, 10, and 14 were processed to observe astrocytic, radial glial, and microglial differentiations by glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP), vimentin and ricinus communis agglutinin-I (RCA-I) stainings, respectively. Four embryos were assigned to subgroups of each POD and control embryos. In the control group, GFAP positivity was shown faintly at the dorsal midline on embryonic day (E) 10 (corresponding to POD 7), in the ventral one-third of the white matter on E 13 and in the whole white matter on E 17. Embryos with ONTDs showed earlier and stronger GFAP positivity from POD 7-14, especially at the dorsal surface and the adjacent gray matter. In the control group, vimentin staining demonstrated a positive reaction at the midline with positivity in a faint, radial pattern on E 8 and E 10. This had all disappeared by E 13 and 17. In embryos with ONTDs, vimentin positivity was enhanced and persisted from POD 5-14. These findings were prominent along the dorsal surface of ONTDs. No difference in RCA-I staining was found between the control and ONTD groups. The results reveal that ONTD promotes astrocytic differentiation and prolongs expression of radial glial fibers, which seems to be a reaction to the damage caused by exposure of the spinal cord tissue to amniotic fluid.",

We compared the ability of a microglial cell line, primary adult quiescent microglial cells and neonatal microglia. All three cell types are able to activate a CD8 + antigen specific T cell line, but with variable efficiencies as primary microglial cells are indeed less efficient than neonatal cells. Interestingly, it reflects their respective activation state, confirming that adult quiescent microglia needs some activating stimulus to become fully competent. Nevertheless, we also confirmed that these quiescent microglial cells are able to take up, process and present antigens in MHC class I molecules in situ. These results thus open new perspectives in the treatment of cerebral malignancies as new glioma expressed antigens are regularly described.",

We have observed that dendritic cells (DCs), a key cell type in immune responses, have the receptor for CP, and engagement of this receptor has powerful immune consequences. In this study we demonstrate that intratumoral administration of CP into preexisting tumors results in retarded progression of the injected tumor and leads to significant inhibition of growth of other, un-injected tumors in the same animal.

Poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis is one such cellular DNA damage responses. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1) acts as a DNA damage sensor and facilitates the access of other DNA repair factors to the site. New functions of this protein have been recently shown, such as modulating the function of proteins involved in tumorigenic processes. On base of this, we studied the function that PARP-1 may carry out on the genesis and development of the oncogenic process, and specifically those that affect glia. With this purpose we characterized how PARP-1 deficiency would affect the cellular response to a specific oncogenic event. PARP-1 null astrocytes showed a lower rate of proliferation than wild-type cells, maintaining this difference even in the presence of the oncogenic insult. Unexpectedly, glial cells differed from other cell types and neither of the two populations showed features of cellular senescence after an oncogenic stress. Expression of PARP-1 in Adprt \u2212/\u2212 astrocytes rescued the wild-type phenotype. These results allow us to conclude that PARP-1 absence seems to influence, in a negative way, the cell cycle progression, especially in the presence of an oncogenic event. Thus, deficiency in PARP-1 is a proliferative disadvantage for certain tumor cells. To investigate the involvement of galectin-3, a novel substrate for matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and -9, in the process of neurodegeneration in prion disease, the expression and cellular localization of galectin-3 in association with MMP-2 and MMP-9 were studied in the brains of a mouse model of prion disease (scrapie) and human Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD). Both messenger RNA and protein of galectin-3 were significantly increased in scrapie-affected brains, particularly at the time when the abnormal prion protein, PrP Sc , began to accumulate in the brains. As well, we confirmed that galectin-3 was coimmunoprecipiated with MMP-2, but not MMP-9. In addition, we found that galectin-3 binds to normal prion protein, PrP C . Immunohistochemically, galectin-3 was mainly immunostained in B4 isolectin-positive cells (presumably activated microglia), but not in astrocytes, in areas of PrP Sc accumulation and neuronal death in scrapie infected brains as well as in human brain with CJD.",

Bacterial meningitis is characterized by the invasion of neutrophils, and production of cytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6) which cause an inflammatory response that causes to intracranial complications, such as brain edema formation and increase in intracranial pressure (ICP). In this study we investigated the role of the SFKs fgr, hck, and lyn in a murine model of pneumococcal meningitis using fgr \u2212/\u2212 hck \u2212/ \u2212 lyn \u2212/\u2212 triple knockout mice. Intracisternal injection of live pneumococci in wild-type mice caused a significant increase in cerebrospinal-fluid (CSF) leukocyte count and ICP 24 h after infection. In infected fgr \u2212/\u2212 hck \u2212/\u2212 lyn \u2212/\u2212 mice CSF pleocytosis was significantly attenuated whereas the increase in ICP was more pronounced. Cerebral expression of IL-6, CXCL-1, CXCL-2 and G-CSF was increased in infected triple KO mice compared with infected wild-type mice. Lack of SFKs was associated with a worse clinical outcome and higher mortality rate. Moreover, bacterial titers in the brain and in the blood of infected fgr \u2212/\u2212 hck \u2212/\u2212 lyn \u2212/\u2212 mice were 10\u00d7 higher compared with infected wild-type mice indicating an impaired host defense. In vitro studies revealed that in fgr \u2212/\u2212 hck \u2212/\u2212 lyn \u2212/\u2212 leukocytes challenged with pneumococci ROS production was completely inhibited whereas bacterial uptake (phagocytosis) was not affected. These results indicate the SFKs fgr, hck, and lyn play a pivotal role in leukocyte recruitment and bacterial clearance by activating ROS production during bacterial meningitis.",

The aim of the current study was to assess intrathecal synthesis of IgG in patients with NCC. Sixteen patients with the active form of NCC were selected and compared with 21 patients of the control group, which included multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, aseptic meningitis, ischemic cerebrovascular disorder, and chronic headache without pleocytosis. Intrathecal synthesis of IgG was studied by quantitative methods (IgG index, Tourtellotte's formula, and Reiber's diagram) and by a qualitative method (oligoclonal IgG bands) in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid. In the NCC group, intrathecal synthesis of IgG was detected in 12 (75%) and 5 (31.2%) patients by quantitative and qualitative methods, respectively. In the control group, excluding patients with multiple sclerosis and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, intrathecal synthesis of IgG was detected in 2 (11.8%) patients. The intrathecal synthesis of IgG in NCC patients had the same pattern of multiple sclerosis patients. Intrathecal synthesis of IgG was not associated with any variable indicative of an inflammatory process in patients with the active form of NCC. Further studies are required to investigate possible intrathecal synthesis of IgG in the different evolutionary stages of NCC.",

This study aimed to examine the astrocytic response by using Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and Vimentin (VIM) immunostaining in an experimental Encephalitozoon cuniculi infection in the central nervous system (CNS) of immunosuppressed mice. It is known that although VIM expression progressively disappears in astrocytes after birth, reactive astrocytes may soon recover their capacity to express this protein following injury. Adult Balb-C mice were divided into 3 groups: I-mice immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg, twice a week, intraperitoneal route-IP) during the experimental period and inoculated with E. cuniculi (IP); IIimmunocompetent mice inoculated with E. cuniculi; and III-non-infected and non-immunosuppressed mice. The infected animals were killed from 15 to 75 days post-inoculation. Tissue samples were collected and processed for light microscopy investigation. Gram-Chromotrope and Hematoxylin-Eosin staining techniques were performed, as well as GFAP and VIM immunohistochemical staining (avidin-biotin method). Infected mice presented multifocal granulomas in all organs, but the proportion of such granulomas was higher in group I. A lymphocytic, diffuse, non-suppurative menongoencephalomyelitis was observed and spores were seen in the microgranulomas. Increased astrocytic GFAP immunostaining was noted and reexpression of VIM was found in reactive astrocytes surrounding the granulomas. This astocytic response was more intense in group I than in group II and no VIM expression was seen in astrocytes from group III. The parasites were easily identified in Gram-Chromotrope stained sections. E. cuniculi infection developed an intense astrocytic reaction in the CNS, especially in immunosuppressed animals.

We analyzed the B cell repertoire by four-colour flow cytometry and determined the viral load in CSF and blood of these patients. B cell subsets in HIV were compared to patients with other inflammatory or non-inflammatory neurological diseases. The number of B cells and plasmablasts was significantly elevated in CSF of HIV patients compared to both control groups. CSF B cell and plasmablast numbers were higher in untreated clinically asymptomatic HIV infected patients than symptomatic or AIDS patients. Determination of virus loads in both compartments revealed that CSF pleocytosis correlated with CSF virus titers but not with serum virus titers. In CSF and blood a strong correlation between the percentage of plasmablasts and HI virus load was observed. The extent of intrathecal production of IgG also correlated with CSF viral load and the percentage of plasmablasts. Our findings demonstrate a profound early B cell response to HIV in the CNS.

However, the underlying mechanisms regulating SDF-1 production are unknown. In this report, we investigate the role of macrophage, an important cell type in HAD pathogenesis, in mediating SDF-1 production from astrocytes. Our data demonstrates that astrocytes are the major cell population expressing SDF-1 in the brain. Immune activated and/or HIV-1infected monocyte-derived-macrophage (MDM) conditioned media (MCM) induced a substantial increase in SDF-1 production by human astrocytes. Elevated SDF-1 production by astrocytes corresponds to a concomitant IL-1\u03b2 upregulation in infected/activated macrophages. Moreover, MCMinduced astrocyte SDF-1 production is abrogated by IL-1\u03b2 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) and IL-1\u03b2 siRNA treatment of human MDM. These observations provide evidence that IL-1\u03b2 from HIV-1-infected andactivated macrophage plays a critical role in SDF-1 production from astrocytes, and may contribute to SDF-1 mediated CNS regulation during HAD. Trafficking of monocytes through the blood brain barrier (BBB) is one pathway through which human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can disseminate into the central nervous system (CNS). Studies have suggested that inflammation within the bone marrow compartment may be responsible for increased migration of HIV-1-infected monocytes to the CNS and thus contribute to the pathologic events associated with HIV-1 dementia (HIVD). Interestingly, progenitor cells within the bone marrow are refractile to HIV-1 infection, but become susceptible as they differentiate. The TF-1 bone marrow progenitor cell line was selected as a model to study HIV-1 infection during the differentiation process of hematopoietic progenitor cells. The IL-1beta proinflammatory cytokine has been shown to have an effect on bone marrow progenitor cell proliferation. IL-1beta and a variety other of cytokines known to have a role in hematopoiesis (GM-CSF, M-CSF, IL-4) or inflammation (IL-6, TNF-alpha) were studied for their ability to induce differentiation. The effect of IL-1beta was considerably more dramatic than any other cytokine used resulting in CXCR4 and CCR5 upregulation with preservation of CD4 expression, potentially providing a window of opportunity for HIV-1 infection. CD34 and CD38 were downregulated while CD69 was modestly upregulated, indicative of differentiation and activation respectively. Moreover, transient and stable transfection analysis demonstrated that HIV-1 LTR activity was significantly increased following treatment of TF-1 cells with IL-1beta and TNF-alpha. These results indicate that progenitor cell differentiation potentially increases during the course of disease were evaluated, and their possible role as a predictive factor for neurological complications was statistically analyzed. Results: Seventy-six patients were male (67%) and sexual contact was the most common mode of transmission at 91.1%, with heterosexuality the dominating sexual preference (90.8%). Non-compliance to ART was associated with a higher incidence of neurological complications (p = 0.001, Chi-square test). Among all the variables investigated, only serum sodium levels at the time of diagnosis of HIV infection were found to be correlated with the development of neurological complications (p = 0.017, Mann-Whitney U test). Statistically significant declines in CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell counts were observed in association with neurological complications. (p = 0.003 and p = 0.026, respectively). Conclusion: Uninhibited HIV replication causes hyponatremia as a result of dysfunction of the renin-angiotensin system. Neurological complications are known to develop more commonly in patients with uncontrolled infections. This is the first study to establish a link between hyponatremia and neurological complications. Drugs of abuse act as co-factors in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection and in the progression to HIV-1 associated neuronal dysfunction. The effect of cocaine on the expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 and the mechanisms by which cocaine regulates this receptor have yet to be determined in normal human astrocytes (NHA). Recent evidence indicates that cocaine activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinases) to induce cellular changes. We hypothesize that cocaine alters signal transduction pathways in astrocytes leading to neuronal dysfunction in the infected subject. Treatment of NHA with cocaine increased the expression of CXCR4 and extracellular signal related kinase (ERK) as determined by quantitative PCR and western blot analyses. Furthermore, cocaineinduced phosphorylation of ERK occurred in a dose and time dependent manner (1 pM-1 \u03bcM, 15 min) with a maximum response occurring at 1 \u03bcM. No change in total ERK levels occurred. Exposure of NHA to PD 98059, an inhibitor of ERK, prior to cocaine treatment, prevented the upregulation of CXCR4 induced by cocaine alone. These results suggest that cocaine-induced modulation of neuroimmune pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection may be mediated via dysregulation of MAPK and may help to develop novel therapeutic strategies to prevent cocaine induced neuronal dysfunctions.",

Herein, we developed a model of ATN induced by didanosine (ddI) following infection by the closely related lentivirus, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Methods: After treatment with ddI of FIV-infected animals and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) cultures, we investigated neuronal and nerve morphology, neurobehavioral testing, viral load, mitochondrial and neurotrophic factor gene expression. Results: Both FIV and ddI caused titer and concentration-dependent DRG neuronal injury in vitro, respectively, with evidence of an additive neurotoxic effect depending on the neuronal parameter. In vivo FIV infection showed delays in latency to a noxious stimulus, which were exacerbated by ddI treatment. FIV-infected DRG neurons were highly vulnerable to ddI toxicity. The epidermal density of sural nerve endings were reduced after FIV infection, especially with ddI treatment. ddI did not diminish virus replication in DRGs of FIV-infected animals although it suppressed viral replication in sera from the same animals. ddI decreased mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase unit II expression in DRGs of FIVinfected animals, and also in feline lymphocytes. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression was down-regulated by ddI in Schwann cells of DRGs following FIV infection. Conclusion: ddI treatment results in ATN, which was associated with mitochondrial injury and reduced BDNF production by Schwann cells. Hence, BDNF reduction may serve as a potential target for ATN therapy in the future.",

Mabbott Institute for Animal Health, Ogston Building, West Mains Road, Edinburgh EH9 3JF, United Kingdom Neil.mabbott@bbsrc.ac.uk Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) (or 'prion diseases') are neurodegenerative diseases that affect both humans and animals. Natural TSE infections are usually acquired by peripheral exposure, eg: ingestion or via skin lesions. Following exposure, infectivity usually accumulates in lymphoid tissues before spreading to the brain. We have shown that follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) resident in lymphoid follicles are important sites of TSE agent accumulation in lymphoid tissues. Indeed, TSE pathogenesis is critically dependent on FDCs as in their absence, TSE agent accumulation in lymphoid tissues is blocked and disease susceptibility is significantly reduced. Once TSE agents have accumulated on FDCs, infection spreads along peripheral nerves to the central nervous system, a process termed 'neuroinvasion'. However, it is not known from which lymphoid tissue/s TSE agent neuroinvasion actually occurs from. For example, following oral inoculation, PrP Sc accumulates first on FDCs in Peyer's patches and gut-associated lymphoid tissues and subsequently spreads to nondraining lymph nodes and the spleen. Whether efficient neuroinvasion occurs directly following accumulation upon the FDCs that are first encountered within the draining lymphoid tissue (eg: Peyer's patches following oral inoculation) or requires dissemination from FDCs networks within multiple lymphoid tissues is not known. Using mice deficient in various combinations of gut-associated lymphoid tissues we investigate the contribution of these tissues to TSE agent neuroinvasion from the intestine following oral exposure. The identification of the cells, tissues and mechanisms involved in TSE agent neuroinvasion may identify an important process to which therapeutic intervention can be directed.",

Recent epidemiological studies have shown an increased risk of acquiring a new autoimmune disease for subjects having one autoimmune disease. Multiphasic demyelinating autoimmune syndromes and MS can occur concurrently with other autoimmune diseases including autoimmune thyroid disease, autoimmune gastritis, Addison's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, pemphigus vulgaris and scleroderma. In different populations an increased prevalence of multiple sclerosis in adults with type 1 diabetes and their firstdegree relative has been reported before. Method-results: We present three patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus who developed central nervous system demyelinating disease in their follow-up. Patients will be discussed with their common and special clinical, genetic and cranial magnetic resonance imaging findings.",

An important feature of T cells is their ability to become sensitized to specific antigens such that re-exposure to an antigen produces a more robust T cell response. We hypothesized that T cells with prior exposure to motoneuron injury would show increased responsiveness to subsequent motoneuron injury and that these sensitized T cells would enhance neuronal survival. Na\u00efve mice received a sham surgery while sensitized mice received an axotomy of the facial nerve. Both groups received an experimental axotomy of the contralateral nerve 9.5 weeks later. The neuroimmune response was quantified in the experimentally axotomized facial motor nucleus (FMN) for numbers of CD3 + T cells, microglia expressing major histocompatibility complex II, and CD11b + microglial phagocytic clusters. The effect of T cell sensitization on motoneuron viability following injury was determined by counting the number of surviving motoneurons and by measuring the cross-sectional area of motoneurons in representative sections throughout the FMN. The number of T cells was greater in the injured FMN of sensitized mice following the experimental axotomy compared to na\u00efve controls. The enhanced T cell response was not accompanied by improved motoneuron survival. Our data suggest that T cell sensitization occurs in response to neuronal injury and that the increased responsiveness of these cells is not sufficient to promote motoneuron survival. Further research is required to determine whether T cells can alter the functional status of neurons following injury.",

Introduction: In the central nervous system (CNS) NO regulates the proliferation of neural stem/progenitor cells both during development and adulthood. During neuroinflammatory conditions and trauma, NO and its production correlates with disease activity. Methods: We exposed adult NSC cultures from female Dark Agouti rats to the NO-donor, DETA-NONO:ate. The effects of NO on differentiation were assessed by immuno-labeling the cells for neuronal (Tuj), oligodendrocyte-(O4) and astrocyte-(GFAP) lineage markers and with western blotting. Realtime RT-PCR was used to quantify the expression of genes known to be active at early stages of neurogenesis. Results: After exposure to NO, neurogenesis was downregulated and this corresponded to decreased expression of the pro-neural gene neurogenin-2, and \u03b2-III-tubulin. The decreased ability to generate neurons was also found to be transmitted to the progeny of the cells. NO exposure was instead beneficial for astroglial differentiation, which was confirmed by increased activation of the JAK/STAT-1 signal transduction pathway. Conclusion: These results have clinical implications for diseases like Multiple Sclerosis and trauma, where neuroregeneration is impaired by glial scar formation.",

Active maintenance of this cell population declines with aging, which may contribute to decreased repair and plasticity. The environment of the proliferative zones modulates neurogenesis with the critical factors yet to be identified. From CD-1 mice (22 days or 1 year old), the SGZ of the hippocampus was isolated by laser capture microdissection, RNA amplified and hybridized to Affymetrix Whole Mouse Genome GeneChips. The molecular profile differed as a function of age with 398 genes/ESTs showing differentially altered expression. When the SGZ was examined following injury induced by the hippocampal toxicant, trimethyltin, levels for 1083 genes/ESTs were altered. Differential responses with injury occurred as a function of age. Pathway mapping of the molecular profile in the neurogenic environment included the interleukin-1\u03b1 pathway (IL1A, MYD88, TRADD, and TNFRSF1A) in the immature brain and the IL-6 pathway (IL6, IL6, Grb2, RAF1, and MAPK1) in the 1-yearold brain. This pathway difference was seen in both na\u00efve and injured brain. The level of neurogenesis induced by TMT, as identified by BrdU + /NeuN + immunostaining, suggests a greater response in the 22-day-old mouse as compared to the response at 1-year. Age related changes in the SGZ molecular profile may contribute to neurogenesis following injury. Characterization of the age related differences in the neurogenic environment will identify novel signaling factors to promote repair in the adult brain.",

Thus, we sought to study the effect of MSC on T cells and B cells undergoing apoptosis by different stimuli. MSC rescued T and B cells from death when cultured in serum free condition. Similar effect was observed on human isolated thymocytes that were rescued from spontaneous apoptosis. MSC also decreased the percentage of annexin V positive T cells upon the induction of activation induced cell death (AICD). Upon AICD trigger in the presence of MSC, we observed a decreased expression of Fas and FasL, granzyme B and total caspases by T cells. MSC also decreased anti-Fas induced apoptosis of Jurkat T-cells. To study the effect of MSC on B cells apoptosis, we isolated normal germinal center (GC) B cells, a subset undergoing spontaneous apoptosis in secondary lymphoid organs, which can be reverted in vitro by CD40 ligation. MSC rescued GC B cells from spontaneous apoptosis with an efficiency comparable to that of CD40L. These findings are relevant for the use of MSC for multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases as they suggest that MSC have an immunosuppressive effect on lymphocyte proliferation but support their survival in a quiescent state and protect them from apoptosis.",

Intravenously injected adultNSC can migrate and home to areas of damage in the CNS. We therefore investigated the expression (RT-PCR) of integrins and chemokine receptors before and after in-vitro differentiation of adultNSC, their potential involvement in adhesion and migration of adultNSC, and their homing to insulted areas in the brain. Our analysis of several members of integrins and of CCR and CXCR chemokine receptors show that adultNSC express a relatively high basal level of VLA-1 and CXCR4, which are significantly upregulated upon induction of differentiation. CXCR5 is constitutively expressed, albeit in very low levels, and is not upregulated upon adultNSC differentiation. CXCR1 and CXCR3 are not expressed in the undifferentiated adultNSC, but are significantly induced upon differentiation. Analysis of intra-cellular signaling pathways activated by the ligands of the integrins, in particular laminin, suggests the involvement of the ERK pathway and of the upstream signaling mediators Fyn and Grb2. In contrast, activation by the CXCL12 and CXCL13 ligands of CXCR4 and CXCR5, respectively, reduced ERK phosphorylation but increased p38 phosphorylation.",

Olig2 is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor which is essential for the generation of motoneurons and oligodendrocytes. In the spinal cord of Olig2 null mice, motoneurons and oligodendrocytes are completely disappeared. Besides, previous lineage analysis experiments using Olig2-GFP and Olig1-Cre mice suggested that Olig2-expressing progenitors in the pMN domain generate motoneurons and oligodendrocytes, but not astrocytes. So, Olig2-expressing progenitors are expected as possible candidates for the transplantation therapy in demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injury. However, previous lineage analysis systems include some problems, it is not clear whether another cell-type is produced from the pMN domain. For clinical application of Olig2-expressing progenitors, it is very important to reveal whether motoneurons and oligodendrocytes are the only cell types of cells produced from the pMN domain. To elucidate the accurate lineage of Olig2-expressing progenitors, we performed lineagetracing experiments using a tamoxifen-inducible Cre-recombinase inserted into the Olig2 locus. In this study, we demonstrated that motoneurons and oligodendrocytes are derived from the Olig2-expressing progenitors in the pMN domain, and also found that a subset of astrocytes and ependymal cells are also produced from the pMN domain.

In addition to immunity against the vial vectors, the mutant hosts also develop immune responses to the transgenic products that are nonimmunogenic in normal animals. Methods: Fifteen adult female Balb/c mice were divided into three groups and immunized intradermally. The first group received E. coli beta-galactosidase, the second group received plasmid encoding beta-galactosidase, pCBLacZ, and the last five mice received PBS. The animals were immunized four times. Seven days after the last immunization, they received intramuscular injection of pCBLacZ. Result: ELISA for the titers of anti-galactosidase IgG1 and IgG2a showed that the animals treated with protein developed a Th2 predominant immunity and the mice receiving DNA had a preferential Th1 response. Mean numbers of muscle cells expressing beta-galactosidase were much less in the animals immunized with protein or DNA as compared with the little mates. Those were 0, 0.8 and 23.6. Discussion: Gene delivery to muscle is a potential therapy for protein deficiencies such as hemophilia. Patients may have ever received protein therapy years before the application of gene therapy, or they may need repeated gene therapy to keep long-term expression of the transgene. In this study, we demonstrate that pre-existing immunity with either Th1 or Th2 predominance inhibits transgene expression in muscle cells.",

Gluten sensitivity was confirmed by immunological (antigliadin IgA and IgG antibodies, HLA DQ8) and histological tests (small-bowel inflammation). Conclusion: Gluten sensitivity is an important cause of apparently idiopathic ataxia and may be progressive. Antigliadin antibodies are suggested to be directly or indirectly neurotoxic. The mechanisms responsible for neurological complications of gluten toxicity remain uncertain and gluten-free diet does not improve the neurological disability. Objective: to elucidate causality through a clinical clue, lymphopenia, with reference to a candidate infection",

However, recent findings in the animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), implicate a distinct subset of T H 1 and T H 2 cells. This novel T helper cell is characterised by the secretion of IL-17 (T H IL17). As mice deficient in IL-23, lack the T H IL-17 subset IL-23 is thought to drive the differentiation of T H IL17. IL-23 knock out mice are resistant to EAE, whereas transferring only T H IL-17 cells can induce disease. In addition previous microarray data from MS lesions show highly upregulated IL-17 expression. However, so far it is unclear which cell type and distribution is responsible for IL-17 expression in MS. Using double fluorescent immunohistochemistry techniques and confocal microscopy we observed that IL-17 is present in MS lesions in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. Interestingly, astrocytes and to a lesser extent oligodendrocytes were also positive for IL-17 staining, whereas macrophages, microglia and neurons were negative. Higher levels of IL-17 were present inside the lesions rather than in normal appearing white matter and it was virtually absent in white matter from control individuals. Further, we identified IL-23 staining in perivascular DCs. These findings are in line with the recently proposed importance for perivascular DCs in EAE pathogenesis and implies a similar role in MS. It is possible that perivascular IL-23 expressing DCs drive the IL-17 expression visualised in MS brains. This interesting new T cell subset rewards further attention to unravel its role in MS pathogenesis.PP13-02Elevated CSF and serum levels and intrathecal synthesis of active MMP-2 in MS patients with no evidence of MRI disease activity E.

Methods: We performed clinical and neuroradiological examinations and calculated the odds that an HTLV-Iinfected individual of specified genotype, age, and provirus load has HAM/TSP. Results: Anti-HTLV-I antibodies were positive both in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid in all of the patients. Biopsied sample from spinal cord lesions showed inflammatory changes in patient 1. Six of the seven patients examined showed high risk of developing HAM/TSP in virological and immunological aspects. Conclusion: These eight cases may belong to a variant form of HAM/TSP, predominantly involving the cervical cord levels.

There are strong indications that CD163 plays a direct active role in the inflammatory response, and proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators tightly regulate CD163. In multiple sclerosis (MS) there also seems to be a regulation of CD163 expression, in the brain at the lesion site the amount of CD163 expressing cells is increased, furthermore we have recently shown that membrane expression of CD163 on monocytes is decreased in MS patients compared to healthy donors, whereas the soluble form (sCD163) is increased in the plasma of the MS patients. To date the mechanism of CD163 shedding remains unclear, however there have been indications that matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) are actively involved.Furthermore, previous studies have shown that in vitro stimulation with dexamethasone (DEX), strongly upregulates CD163 expression on human blood monocytes. High-dose intravenous glucocorticosteroids (GCs) are frequently Effects of acidic phospholipids on antiganglioside antibodies in GBS: Role of the disialosyl residue Minako Hirakawa 1,2 , Masami Sada 1 , Shoji Tsuji 2 , Susumu Kusunoki 1 1 Department Neurology, Kinki University, Osaka, Japan; 2 Department Neurology, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan[Introduction] We have reported the increase of the activity of the anti-GM1 IgG antibodies in Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome when a mixture of such acidic phospholipids as phosphatidic acid (PA) and GM1 was an antigen in ELISA. In contrast, phospholipids provided no obvious enhancing effect on the anti-GQ1b IgG in Miller Fisher syndrome. One possible reason of such different effects is the difference in the preceding infections, GM1 epitope of pathogens being presented with a phospholipid to the patients. Another possibility is the difference of the physiochemical properties of two antigens; GQ1b has two disialosyl residues having strongly negative charge, while GM1 does not. [Methods] To investigate the former possibility, we sensitized rabbits with a mixture of GM1 and PA (GM1/PA) to see whether the antibodies thus produced show higher titer against GM1/PA or not. To clarify the role of charge influences, we examined the effect of the phospholipids on IgG against GD1b, which shares a disialosyl residue with GQ1b and the terminal Gal-GalNAc structure with GM1. [Results and Discussion] There was no significant difference in the antibody specificities in rabbits sensitized either with GM1 or with GM1/PA. The anti-GD1b IgG activities with anti-Gal-GalNAc specificity were increased when GD1b/PA was an antigen, whereas those monospecific to GD1b were not. Thus, the enhancing effect of PA may not be due to the presence of a phospholipid within the bacteria of the antecedent infection. It may depend on whether the antibody recognizes disialosyl residue or not.",

The homogenate of peripheral nervous tissue from healthy subject was applied to two-dimensional electrophoresis on two or more gels run in parallel. One was stained with SyproRuby used for spot cutting and protein sequencing, and the other gel was electroblotted onto PVDF membrane. The transferred-membrane was immunostained with patients sera, and then immunoreactive spots were visualized by chemiluminescence substrate. Immunoreactive signals of membrane and protein spots on gel were matched by using Decyder software (Amersham Biosciences). The matched protein spots were picked from gel, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS sequencing of tryptic peptides. Over 30 of antigenic proteins reacted on immunoblots membrane with CIDP, GBS and anti-MAG sera. A few immunoreactive spots were detected with leprosy sera and patterns of spot maps varied greatly among individual patients of leprosy. More than 20 spots were successfully matched with SyproRuby stained gels, which were further selected for MS analysis for protein sequencing. In conclusion, serological proteome analysis may provide a useful tool for the identification of novel autoimmune antigens, whose relevance to pathogenically events in autoimmune neuropathies remains to be defined.",

To determine whether C. coli is a causative agent, we examined the hypothesis that production of anti-ganglioside antibodies is induced by ganglioside-mimics on that bacterial lipo-oligosaccharide (LOS), as in C. jejuni-associated GBS. LOSs of both C. coli isolates had very weak reactivities with anti-GM1 and anti-GD1a IgG monoclonal antibodies, whereas those of some GBS-related C. jejuni isolates had strong reactivities. Anti-GM1 and anti-GD1a IgG antibodies from the two patients were not absorbed as much by the LOSs of their isolates as were those of GBS-related C. jejuni strains. These findings do not support the hypothesis of ganglioside mimicry on C. coli isolates' LOSs. We next made a serological assay of recent C. coli infection in 74 patients with GBS, 26 with Fisher syndrome (FS), 49 with other neurological diseases (OND), and 37 normal controls (NC) using the bacterial outer membrane protein as antigen. Eight (11%) GBS and 2 (8%) FS patients had two or three classes of IgG, IgM, and IgA anti-C. coli antibodies. Anti-C. jejuni IgG and IgA antibody titers were significantly higher than those of anti-C. coli (respectively, p = 0.03 and 0.01). This suggests that anti-C. coli antibodies cross-react with C. jejuni protein. We concluded that a C. coli infection was not the cause of GBS in our patients. Both isolation of a microorganism from, and the positive infectious serology of, GBS patients do not always indicate the causal agent.",

The IgG antibodies to GM1, GM1b, GD1a, or GalNAc-GD1a were examined by ELISA. Information on preceding infectious symptoms, neurological findings, electrodiagnoses, treatments, and outcomes was obtained.Results: The anti-ganglioside IgG antibodies were positive in 14 of 32 patients. Patients with preceding gastro-intestinal tract infection were 8 (57%) in positive group (n = 14), but 2 (11%) in negative group (n = 18) (p = 0.01). Neurological findings did not differ between positive and negative groups. Nerve conduction studies showed that 9 patients (64%) in positive group were diagnosed as having axonal pattern, but 2 (11%) in negative group (p = 0.006). All the patients had favorable outcome.

There have been no studies of a large number of PCB patients because of its rarity. Objective: To elucidate the clinical profiles of PCB patients. Methods: Patients presenting progressive weakness predominant in the pharynx, neck, and upper limbs within 4 weeks were recruited. Clinical features, antecedent infections, and anti-ganglioside antibodies were investigated. Results: Diagnoses of 100 patients were pure PCB (n = 32), deep tendon reflexes-preserved PCB (n = 8), GBS overlap (n = 29), Fisher syndrome (FS) overlap (n = 26), and Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis overlap (n = 5). Intratracheal intubation was significantly frequent in GBS overlap than in pure PCB (48% vs. 19%, p = 0.01). Serological test showed that frequent agents of antecedent infections in PCB were (31%) and cytomegalovirus (6%), as in typical GBS, and Haemophilus influenzae was rare (1%) unlike in FS. Antiganglioside IgG antibodies were detected in 68% of the PCB patients and anti-GT1a antibody was the most common (51%), in most cases it had crossreactivity with GQ1b. Anti-ganglioside antibody profiles were similar in pure PCB and GBS overlap populations. Conclusions: Although PCB regularly is accompanied by other overlapping conditions, considerable number of patients was classified as pure PCB, suggesting that PCB is a distinct variant of GBS. GBS overlap was potentially defined as severe condition of PCB. PCB appeared to be closer to GBS than to FS, based on the antecedent infectious agents and autoantibody profile.",

However, some patients have severe sequences and sometimes they have a recurrent GBS. To understand the condition of a patient with long-term rehabilitation and of a recurrence cases, we evaluated long-term prognosis.[Method] We investigate a clinical symptom, neurological examination, nerve conduction study and anti-ganglioside antibody titers of the cases with GBS or FS after the onset from 2 to 17 years.[Results] Only one case out of 26 cases that we were able to evaluate this time, showed serious sequences who had the axonal type of GBS which developed in China. Most cases recovered for everyday life even in the most severe patients group who needed mechanical ventilation. However, the neurological examination showed slight abnormality, and there were many cases to have abnormality for H wave in particular by nerve conduction study. Some cases have a positive of an anti-ganglioside antibody for a long term without the exacerbation and the recurrence of a symptom.[Conclusions] Generally it is thought that an axonal type is poor prognosis, but it is important that there were many good cases as for the long-term convalescence. Objectives: To clarify the neurological disease spectrum associated with autoantibodies against minor gangliosides GM1b and GalNAc-GD1a and to develop a new method for GM1b preparation. Methods: IgG and IgM antibody reactivity against gangliosides GM1, GM1b, GD1a, GalNAc-GD1a, and GQ1b in sera from 6800 consecutive patients who had various neurological conditions. Clinical features and their correlation with those autoantibodies were analyzed. GM1b was produced from asialo-GM1 by means of Campylobacter jejuni sialyltransferase and isolated by column chromatography. Results: The clinical diagnoses for 456 anti-GM1bpositive patients were Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS; 71%), atypical GBS with preserved deep tendon reflexes (12%), Fisher syndrome (10%), Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis (2%), ataxic GBS (2%), acute ophthalmoparesis (1%). For 193 anti-GalNAc-GD1a-positive patients, the diagnoses were GBS (70%), atypical GBS (16%), Fisher syndrome (10%), and Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis (3%). Of the patients with GBS or atypical GBS, 28% of the 381 anti-GM1b-positive and 31% of the 166 anti-GalNAc-GD1a-positive patients had neither anti-GM1 nor anti-GD1a antibodies. Of those patients with Fisher syndrome, Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis, ataxic GBS, or acute ophthalmoparesis, 33% of the 67 anti-GM1b-positive and 52% of the 25 anti-GalNAc-GD1a-positive patients had no anti-GQ1b antibodies. Purity of the isolated GM1b was confirmed by thin-layer chromatography. Conclusion: Autoantibodies against GM1b and GalNAc-GD1a are associated with GBS, Fisher syndrome, and related conditions. These antibodies should provide useful serological markers for identifying patients who have atypical GBS with preserved deep tendon reflexes, ataxic GBS, Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis, or acute ophthalmoparesis, especially for those who have no antibodies to GM1, GD1a, or GQ1b.",

The rat sciatic nerve was put on the recording chamber. Human and rabbit sera with high titer of anti GM1 antibody were applied to a pool located between the proximal and distal stimulation electrodes in the chamber. We stimulated the nerve at the proximal and distal stimulation sites and recorded the compound nerve action potentials (CNAP) at the more distally-situated recording site. Proximally-stimulated CNAP (P) was compared with distally-stimulated one (D). Human and rabbit anti-GM1 antibody-positive sera caused significant reduction of P/D ratio, which suggested conduction block, within a few hours. Human and rabbit control sera did not cause such reduction. Human and rabbit anti GM1 anti-sera that was preheated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min did not produce the conduction block.

            "text": "Anti-GM1 IgG antibodies mediate complement-dependent destruction of sodium channel clusters in peripheral motor nerve fibers Background: The thymus is important for the selection and maturation of T cells. In disease, the thymus is capable of establishing a microenvironment conducive to the survival of auto-reactive T and B cells. A classical example is myasthenia gravis (MG)an antibody-mediated autoimmune diseasein which anti-acetylcholine-receptor (AchR) antibodies are present. In MG, the thymus shows ectopic germinal centers (GC) that are also a source of antibodies. To understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the accumulation of B cells within myasthenic thymi, we evaluated the thymic expression of recently characterized B-cell survival factors, APRIL and BAFF.Methods: We used immunohistochemistry and two-color immunofluorescence to study protein expression of APRIL, BAFF and their receptors-BAFF-R, BCMA and CD138. Using ELISA, we quantified plasma APRIL and BAFF levels. Additionally, BAFF-R, BCMA and TACI mRNA levels in peripheral-blood B cells were quantified in patients and controls by real-time PCR.Results: APRIL and BAFF were abundantly expressed by thymic macrophages. BAFF-R expression was limited to B cells within the GC and was undetectable in thymoma. BCMA-positive plasma cells were abundant in patients with hyperplastic thymi. CD138-postive plasma cells were restricted to the perivascular space and thymic parenchyma. Soluble levels of APRIL and BAFF were not increased in patients compared to controls and did not correlate to anti-AchR levels. Levels of mRNA of BAFF-R, BCMA and TACI were comparable between patients and controls.Conclusions: Intrathymic expression of APRIL, BAFF and their receptors may support survival of autoreactive cells and contribute to MG pathogenesis. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the area of thymic tissue per section (% of the total tissue), Ki-67 (cell proliferation marker) and CD21 (mature B cells, follicular dendritic cells) expression in thymus of patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) and to determine the potential correlation with clinical parameters.Methods: We analyzed thymic compartment in 17 patients (5 males and 12 females; mean age 51.9 years) with MG who underwent extended thymectomy. Two of the patients were in Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) class I, 6 were in class II, and 9 were in class III.Results: Microscopic examination of thymus showed thymic hyperplasia in 8 (mean age 38.6 years), thymoma with hyperplasia in 3 (52.7 years), thymoma with involution in 3 (69.0 years) and involution in 3 (69.3 years). The area of thymic tissue and numbers of the germinal center (GC) for section expressed Ki-67 and CD21 had inverted correlation with age of onset. GC frequencies (GC/ mm 2 of thymic tissue) with CD21 expression were significantly higher in hyperplasia (with or without thymoma) group than in involution (with or without thymoma) group. The area of the Ki-67 expression had positive correlation with MGFA class.Conclusion: Age of onset is the most strongest inverse factor of the area of thymic tissue and the numbers of the GC expressed Ki-67 and CD21. Increased proliferation in thymus accompany advanced disease stage. The thymus is implicated in the pathogenesis of early onset-myasthenia gravis (EOMG) associated with AChR autoantibodies (AChRAb + ). It shows hyperplasia of medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEC) and lymph nodelike infiltrates with germinal centres (GC). AChR is expressed by the rare muscle-like thymic myoid cells, and isolated AChR subunits by TEC. In generalised MG without detectable AChR antibodies, some have antibodies to muscle specific kinase (MuSKAb + ). The thymus is less well studied but is reportedly 'normal-for-age' or atrophic, and clinical benefits of thymectomy are unproven. We have re-assessed thymic samples from 30 AChRAb \u2212 / MuSKAb \u2212 and 14 AChRAb \u2212 /MuSKAb + patients, comparing them with 23 EOMG (AChRAb + ) and 11 non-myasthenic adults by immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescence staining of paraffin-embedded sections. Overall, we found few abnormalities in the MuSKAb + thymi, only 4/14 showing small infiltrates. In \u223c 70% of the AChRAb \u2212 /MuSKAb \u2212 MG samples, however, we found substantial infiltrates (cytokeratin \u2212 areas in thymic medulla), though GC (CD20 + /CD35 + CD21 + ) numbers and sizes were modest (Leite et al., 2005) . We now find that in AChRAb + and nearly 50% of the AChRAb \u2212 /MuSKAb \u2212 MG thymi, there are myoid cells exposed to the infiltrates. In both groups, some mTECs and many 'exposed' myoid cells, particularly near GCs, show deposits of activated C3c (and sometimes C9) complement components. These results further implicate both mTECS in priming specific helper T cells and myoid cells in GC formation with autoantibody diversification/perpetuation. The similarities between AChRAb + and AChRAb \u2212 /MuSKAb \u2212 MG thymi strongly suggest that they belong to the same spectrum.",

The production of the Ab is mainly regulated by cytokines derived from Th1 or Th2 type cells. In this study, 60 MG patients and 23 healthy controls (HC) are included. Among the patients, 17 had anti-MuSK Ab and 18 had anti-AChR Ab only whereas 25 did not have any of these Ab.

However, little is known about their associations with prostate adenocarcinoma.Objective: To identify and characterize PNS and Oncabs associated with prostate adenocarcinoma.Methods: We identified 9 patients with prostate adenocarcinoma associated PNSdefined by PNSEuronetwork guidelinesfrom our PNS databases. Sera were screened for Oncabs using immunohistochemistry, Western blotting and recombinant antigen immunoblotting (Ravo). Results: 7 patients had definite and 2 had possible PNS. 5 had sensorimotor polyneuropathy, 2 myopathy, 1 limbic encephalitis (LE) and 1 lower motor neuronopathy (LMN). All PNS were subacute onset and progressive. 8 developed after (mean 7.6, SD 2.8 months) and one 18 months before cancer diagnosis. 5 patients had Hu antibodies (3 polyneuropathy, 1 LE, 1 LMN). 4 had atypical CNS antibodies. Of this group, 2 patients had strong atypical serum binding to the cytoplasm of all brain neurones, with no binding on Western blots, associated with severe, proximal myopathy.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that prostate adenocarcinoma is associated with PNS, particularly of the peripheral nervous system presenting as polyneuropathy, polymyopathy, and motor neuronopathy. Only 1 patient had a CNS syndrome -LE. Most (5/9; 56%) of our patients had Hu Oncabs. The other 4/9 had atypical CNS antibodies and 2 of these patients had similar serum antibody reactivities associated with a myopathy. Further study will determine the usefulness of these novel myopathy-associated antibodies in the diagnosis and management of prostate cancer.",

However, there are few reports of Tregs in paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS). We analyzed lymphocyte subsets and gene expression related to Treg dynamics in PNS patients to clarify immunological states of PNS.Methods: Peripheral blood was obtained from patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) and small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), anti-Hu or anti-Yo antibody positive PNS, SCLC without neurological complications and healthy controls (HC). White blood cells from the venous blood were labeled with CD3, CD4, CD8, CXCR3, CCR4, CD25, CD62L, CD45RA and CD56 and flow cytometry was performed for analysis of the lymphocyte subsets. To examine the gene expression of Tregs, Treg-rich CD4 + CD25 high CD62L high subsets were sorted by FACS and RNA was extracted from them. Then the mRNA expression of FoxP3, the master gene of Tregs, and TGF-\u03b21 were measured by using real-time RT-PCR.Results: The expression of FoxP3 mRNA was diminished in anti-Hu or anti-Yo antibody positive PNS group compared to SCLC group without neurological symptoms, but no significant change was found in TGF-\u03b21 mRNA expression. The percentage of CD3-CD56 + NK cells in the patients of SCLC was higher than HC. But other profiles of lymphocyte subpopulation did not show significant difference among each group.Conclusion; The results of diminished FoxP3 gene expression in anti-Hu or anti-Yo antibody positive PNS group suggested that exaggerated autoimmunity against tumor and nervous tissue in PNS might be caused by the dysfunction of Tregs.",

The mean age of patients at onset of the PNS was 59 years \u00b1 13 (range: 33-84). 11 patients (30%) were younger than 50 years at PNS manifestation. Among our patients 26 (68.4%) were women, and 12 (31.6%) were men. Men tended to be older than women at PZN presentation (64 years \u00b1 14 vs. 57 \u00b1 12, respectively). 22 patients were classified as having the \"classic\" neurological syndrome. Out of them 5 had limbic encephalitis, 5 had sensory neuropathy, 5 had subacute cerebellar degeneration, and 7 had encephalomyelitis. 11 patients had \"non-classic\" syndromes: 3 had myastenic syndrome, 4 had motor neuropathy, 1 had neuromyotonia, and 3 had sensorimotor neuropathies. In 15 patients the underlying tumour was diagnosed: breast cancer (8 patients), SCLC (4 patients), stomach cancer, myeloma, and ovary cancer. Concluding: PNS may present with varied clinical picture. PNS usually affect patients in their sixth decade of life and above. In our study there was female preponderance (2.2:1) that could be accounted for the association with breast tumours.",

Forty five serum samples from healthy persons were negative suggesting adequate specificity. The concordance of the ravo-PNS blot\u00ae to IHCh/WNE was 100% in the following cohorts: 49 anti-Hu sera, 31 anti-Yo sera, 19 anti-amphiphysin sera and 14 anti-Ma2 (Ta) sera. Of 19 anti-Ri positive sera 1 was negative in the ravo-PNS blot\u00ae, however the positive result of IHCh/WNE was considered as wrong in retrospect. Of 26 anti-CV2 positive sera 3 were negative in the ravo-PNS blot\u00ae; in retrospect one of these positive results in IHCh and WNE was considered as wrong. Six of the AntiMa2 and 6 of the anti-Yo positive sera showed in addition to the positive band weak reactions with the Yo antigen (in case of anti-Ma2 sera) or the Ma2 antigen (in case of the anti-Yo sera). In addition clinically defined study groups (25 paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, 21 limbic encephalitis, 20 breast cancer, 48 small cell lung cancer) altogether revealed a high concordance between both test systems. In conclusion two findings deserve further study: 1. A few CV2 positive sera are missed by the ravo-PNS blot\u00ae; 2. Some positive Yo or Ma2 sera show additional weak cross-reactivity with either Ma2 or Yo antigens respectively. However the data suggest that this blot overall is suitable for the detection of paraneoplastic antineuronal antibodies.",

The purpose of this study is to find active marker(s) of NP-SLE by measuring a subset of serum-antoantibodies and cytokine in CSF. We collected total of 10 NP-SLE patients in our hospital. We have evaluated the symptoms and measured the selected markers in serum and CSF. Serial MRI scan, SPECT, and EEG records were also analyzed. Bilateral basal ganglia involvement was observed 3 out of 10 NP-SLE patients. This was confirmed by T2 weighted and FLAIR image. SPECT data showed the hypoperfusion at front-temporal lobe that reflected some aspect of cognitive dysfunction. We could not see any sign of Parkinsonism in associated with decreased basal ganglia perfusion in our series. Even in the severe cerebral involvement IL-6 in CSF and anti-ribosomal p autoantibody in serum did not always show drastic change. In conclusion, there seemed no association with any auto-antibodies and/or cytokine which reflected the psychotic symptoms in unselected NP-SLE as a surrogate marker. This is probably due to the heterogeneity of NP-SLE pathogenesis. ",

We also conducted immunohistochemical analyses of the spinal cords from 8 autopsied ALS cases and 6 non-neurological disease controls as well as cell culture analyses of relevant cytokines and their receptors. Results: We found that concentrations of G-CSF and MCP-1 were significantly increased in ALS CSF compared with controls. In the autopsied spinal cords, G-CSF was expressed in reactive astrocytes in ALS cases but not controls, whereas G-CSF receptor expression was significantly decreased in large motor neurons of spinal cords from ALS cases. Biologically, G-CSF had a protective effect on the motor neuron cell line NSC34 under conditions of both oxidative and nutritional stress. Conclusion: We suggest that G-CSF has a potentially neuroprotective effect on motor neurons in ALS and that downregulation of its receptor might contribute to ALS pathogenesis.",

However, huperzine A at dose of 0.025 mg/kg significantly increased of AChE amount in stomach compared to control.Discussion: It suggests that short-term administration of huperzine A does not change AChE activities after withdrawal, but indeed it change the amount of AChE, which may be by the way of modulating the express and metabolism of AChE and some of AChE may be inactive. Introduction: Chronic inflammatory reaction in the brain was evident in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and are recently also described in affected regions of the brain in Parkinson's disease patients (PD). Immune cells and neuroimmune molecules such as cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors modulate brain function through multiple signaling pathways Objectives: To investigate the effect of inflammatory processes on the Alzheimer's disease (AD)-and tauopathy-related neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) pathology.Background: AD is the most common form of dementia affecting the aging population. The brains of AD patients show evidence of mild active inflammation, including microglial and complement activation, and presence of inflammatory cytokines. Retrospective epidemiological studies have shown a decreased prevalence of AD among patients taking antiinflammatory agents, with some confirmation in prospective studies. Here we study, in an animal model, the effect of inflammatory processes on neurofibrillary-tangles (NFT), the neuropathology which correlates best with dementia in AD and other taupathies.Methods: We exposed 7 NFT-transgenic (tg)-mice (mutant P301S/K257T tau gene) at 6-7 weeks to experimental-autoimmune-encephalomyelitis (EAE), an inflammatory disease of the CNS, using the myelin-oligodendrocyte-glycoprotein (MOG) as an antigen. As controls we used aged-matched tg-mice not exposed to EAE. At 12 months the animals were sacrificed. Spinal-cords and brains were submitted to neuropathological examinations.Results: A significant higher NFT burden was detected in the spinal-cord of the EAE induced tg-mice relative to controls (p < 0.01), using Gallyas staining. This was further confirmed by immunohistochemistry using anti-NFT Abs. EAE-induced mice showed also a significantly higher degree of neurodegeneration relative to controls, as was indicated by the higher antiglial fibrillary acid (GFAP) immunostaining (p < 0.05).Conclusions: Inflammatory related processes of the CNS accelerate the formation of the NFT pathology. This finding, not reported before, may shed light on the NFT pathogenesis and open opportunities to further investigate anti-inflammatory therapeutic approaches.",

PLOSL is globally distributed, but it is enriched in the Finnish and Japanese populations. Our group has characterized the molecular background of PLOSL by identifying mutations in TYROBP (DAP12 or KARAP) and TREM2 genes. The disease phenotype is identical regardless of the mutated gene or type of mutation. In addition to central nervous system (CNS) and bone, DAP12 and TREM2 are expressed in cells of the immune system. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms and biological processes behind PLOSL, we have analyzed the expression profiles of in vitro differentiated dendritic cells (DC) of PLOSL patients with loss-of-function mutations in DAP12 or TREM2 using Affymetrix microarrays. Differentially expressed genes in PLOSL patient DCs were enriched in certain Gene Ontology classes such as immune response and chemotaxis. In agreement with the microarray data, DAP12/TREM2 deficient DCs also showed morphological changes compared to control cells due to altered F-actin organization. Pathways exposed by the expression profiles of PLOSL patient DCs agree well with the up to date suggested functions of DAP12 and TREM2. In addition, significantly diverging transcript levels were observed for genes with altered expression in other disorders of the CNS and genes involved in the remodeling of bone.

However, the interaction of L with host cell factor(s) remains to be elucidated. A bacterial two-hybrid screening identified clathrin-associated protein AP50 as a target molecule of L, which is a component of clathrin-coated vesicle related to the endocytosis of CTLA-4. Interaction between L and AP50 was confirmed both by far-Western blotting and mammalian two-hybrid assay. Furthermore, we generated a mutant virus, which has mutations in tyrosine motif, putative AP50-binding site in L and the virus was inoculated into SJL/J mice intracerebrally. The mice infected with the mutant virus showed less severe pathological changes than mice infected with wild-type DA. FACS analysis of brain-infiltrating lymphocytes revealed that the cell surface CTLA-4 expression in the mutant virus-infected mice was significantly higher than in wild-type DA-infected mice.

The present study was undertaken to clarify the mechanism of an extensive JHMV infection in mouse brain. A soluble-receptor resistant mutant (srr7) which infects solely in an MHVR-dependent fashion was used to clarify the mechanisms. In mixed neural cell cultures, srr7 infected a limited number of cells, and infection did not spread, although wt JHMV spread and induced syncytia in most of the cells in 24 h. Srr7-infected cells were revealed to be positive for GS-lectin, a microglia/macrophage marker. FACS analysis showed that about 80% of the brain cells stained with anti-MHVR antibody (CC1) were also positive for GS-lectin. Pretreatment of those cells with CC1 prevented virus attachment to the cell. These results show that microglia/macrophages express functional MHVR that mediates JHMV infection. As expected, in microglia/macrophage-enriched cultures, srr7, as well as wt JHMV, produced syncytia in a majority of cells. Treatment by CC1of mixed neural cell cultures, as well as microglia cultures previously infected with wt virus, failed to block the spread of infection, indicating that wt infection spreads in an MHVR-independent fashion. Thus, the present study indicates that microglial cells are the major population of the initial target for MHV infection, and wt virus spreads from initially infected microglia to a variety of cells in an MHVR-independent fashion.",

PVC211 exhibited stronger neuropathogenicity than the A8-V, and induced more severe neurological symptoms such as hind-leg paralysis. These symptoms correlated with the neuropathological spread and intensity in the spinal cord of rats infected with PVC211 than in those infected with A8-V. However, virus titers recovered from infected spinal cords were similar in PVC211 and A8-V infected animals, even though the expression levels of the viral antigens in glial cells were different. Serial studies using chimeric viruses derived from the A8-V and the 57 virus (57-V), a nonneuropathogenic strain of Fr-MLV, proved that the LTR and 5\u2032 leader derived from A8-V, in addition to the env gene of A8-V, are necessary for the neuropathogenesis of A8-V. The recombinant viruses R7c and R7f, which lack the enhancer element of A8-V, induced spongiosis with high incidence rates, although the isolated viral titers of the infected brain were very low level even comparable to the 57-V infection. Immuno-histochemical studies demonstrated that infection with neuropathogenic chimerae, R7c and R7f, induced increased expression of viral antigens than that produced by infection with non-neuropathogenic chimeric virus, Rec5, despite the fact that R7c, R7f and Rec5 all exhibited similar levels of viral proliferation in the brain post-infection. Thus, neuropathology induced by A8 infection is not dependent upon the viral proliferation rate but rather the level of viral antigen expression.Address Friend murine leukemia virus (Fr-MLV) clone A8 causes spongiform neurodegeneration in the rat brain. In the lesions of the brains of animals infected with the virus, neutrophil vacuolation is observed, whereas viral antigens are not detected in neurons. Viral antigens are mainly detected in endothelial cells in the brains of infected animals, and glial cells also express viral antigens. Studies with chimerae constructed from A8 virus and nonneuropathogenic Fr-MLV clone 57 identified that the A8-env gene is a primary determinant of neuropathogenicity, and the 1.5-kb ClaI-HindIII fragment containing the LTR and 5\u2032 leader from A8 are additionally required for spongiosis. After replacement of the A8 enhancer region of the neuropathogenic chimera with the enhancer region of non-neuropathogenic 57, viral titer in the brain was reduced by two orders of magnitude. However, the A8 enhancer region was not responsible for the induction of spongiosis. The region responsible for neuropathogenesis was located in the 0.3 kb KpnI-AatII fragment of A8 containing the R-U5-5\u2032 leader. The chimeric",

Nishiura a , T. Nakamura b , N. Fukushima b , H. Ida a , and K. Eguchi a a First Department of Internal Medicine, b Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan Allicin, a natural organosulfur compound derived from garlic (Allium sativum), has diverse biological activities, such as anticarcinogenic activity, antibacterial activity, antifungal activity, etc. Prosultiamine (Alinamin\u00ae), a homolog of allithiamine synthesized by allicin and thiamine, has a similar molecular structure to allicin. We investigated the in vitro cytotoxic effect of allicin against various HTLV-I-or non-infected T cell lines. The results of MTS assays showed that allicin significantly reduced the viability of all cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Of them, HTLV-I-infected T cell lines derived from HAM/TSP patients (HCT-1 and HCT-4) were more sensitive to treatment with allicin than other HTLV-I-or non-infected T cell lines. The treatment of these cell lines with prosultiamine also showed similar effects to allicin treatment; however, fursultiamine (Alinamin F\u00ae), which does not have a similar molecular structure to allicin, did not induce any cytotoxic effect against HCT-1 and HCT-4, suggesting that an allicin-like structure is involved in the cytotoxicity. The findings, such as the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, the activation of caspase-3, the recovery of cell viability by pretreatment with z-VAD-fmk in HCT-1 treated with allicin or prosultiamine, indicated that cytotoxicity was based on caspase-dependent apoptosis. Very interestingly, the in vitro treatment of peripheral blood CD4 + T cells of HAM/TSP patients with allicin or prosultiamine, selectively targeting HTLV-I-infected cells, significantly reduced the number of HTLV-I-infected cells. Our data indicated that allicin and its derivatives have the significant therapeutic potentials against HAM/TSP. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is observed only in 1-2% of HTLV-1 infected individuals. To answer the question why do some HTLV-1infected people develop HAM/TSP whereas the majority remains asymptomatic healthy carriers (HCs), we analyzed the HTLV-1 sequence variation, HTLV-1 provirus load and host genetic polymorphisms in the cohort of Kagoshima, southern Japan. We found that HTLV-1 Tax subtype, several HLA and non-HLA genes are closely associated with the development of HAM/TSP. Based on these findings, we developed the best-fit logistic regression equation to predict the odds of HAM/TSP. We applied this equation to 181 consecutively ascertained HCs and found a significant association between a high odds of HAM/TSP and two factors: brisk patellar deep tendon reflexes, which suggest latent central nervous system compromise, and flower cell (ATL cell)-like abnormal lymphocytes, suggesting the usefulness of our equation for detecting subclinical HAM/ TSP-related neurological abnormalities. The functional significance of HAM/TSP associated HLA and non-HLA genes were also investigated. We found that two HAM/TSP associated alleles, HLA-A\u204e02 and HLA-DRB1\u204e0101 can recognize immunodominant epitopes of the HTLV-1 proteins, and two out of six HAM/TSP associated non-HLA genes were trans-activated by HTLV-1 Tax protein. Interestingly, this Tax mediated trans-activation was affected by different polymorphisms. Our data indicates that complex virus-host interactions play an important role in determining the risk of HAM/TSP. Patients with HAM/TSP show high HTLV-I proviral load despite increased HTLV-I-specific CTL. High proviral load is a strong predictor for the development of HAM/TSP and CTL play a pivotal role in eliminating the virus; however, it is little known what factors of CTL are related to the proviral load. To elucidate, we evaluated frequency, T cell receptor (TCR) degeneracy, avidity, TCR structural heterogeneity in HTLV-I-specific CTL, HTLV-I proviral load and mutant viruses. We measured CTL frequency specific for Tax11-19 and altered peptide ligand (APL) by intracellular IFN\u03b3 staining using 24 PBMC samples from HLA-A2 HAM/TSP patients. Functional diversity (degeneracy) of CTL was evaluated by a calculation of relative recognition of APL. We collected Tax11-19 specific CTL by tetramer and magnetic beads and investigated TCR heterogeneity of the CTL by CDR3 spectratyping. Mutations of tax gene were detected by sequencing and HTLV-I proviral load was measured by a quantitative PCR. Degeneracy of the CTL inversely correlated with the proviral load and CTL frequency. Patients with high structural diversity of the CTL showed low proviral load and low frequency of CTL. Patients with high degeneracy of the CTL had low frequency of mutant viruses. The TCR avidities were comparable among patients. CTL frequency did not correlate with the proviral load. Furthermore, HTLV-I-specific CTL with high TCR degeneracy efficiently recognize naturally occurring mutant viruses. These data suggest that CTL with high degeneracy may more effectively eliminate HTLV-I than that with low degeneracy and reduce mutant viruses.",

It has been hypothesized that both of these cells are involved in the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP. HTLV-I-infected CD4 + cells are detected in the central nervous system (CNS) in HAM/TSP; however, it is not clear whether HTLV-I-specific CTL infiltrate in the CNS. Recent technology of peptide/ MHC multimer (tetramer or pentamer) greatly improves the detection of antigen-specific T cells in vitro and in vivo.

A frozen spinal cord tissue from an HLA-A2 HAM/TSP patient was subjected, where infiltration of inflammatory cells was evident. The lymphocytic infiltration was dominant in the thoracic cord level and in perivascular area. Migrating cells in the spinal cord were mainly CD8 + cells, to a lesser extent CD4 + cells were detected. In situ pentamer staining revealed that Tax11-19-specific CTL frequently infiltrated in the meninges, perivascular area, and parenchyma. These cells were doubly stained with anti-CD8 antibody; over 15% of CD8 + cells were Tax11-19-specific CTL.

We have previously identified nucleotide sequence configurations within C/EBP site I (C to T change at position 3; 3T) and Sp site III (C to T change at position 5; 5T), which correlate with increased HIV-1 disease severity and HIV-1-associated dementia. To begin exploring the LTR phenotype associated with these genotypic changes, a series of stably transfected cell lines were developed utilizing bone marrow progenitor (TF-1), T (Jurkat), and monocytic cell lines (U-937). To this end, macrophage-, T cell-, and dual-tropic LTRs were coupled to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene. The resulting HIV-1 LTR GFP stably expressing cell lines were examined under basal, chemical or cytokine activation, or in the presence of HIV-1 Tat. The results demonstrate that the integrated LTRs had different expression profiles depending on cell type. In TF-1 cells the 3T/5T-containing LTR drives transcription in all cells but with a lower expressing phenotype, however it could be induced to similar levels as the parental LTR, following stimulation and/or in the presence of Tat. The backbone LTR also plays a role in the resulting phenotype. Future studies will examine the impact of specific LTR sequence variation on viral gene expression both in primary cells as well as in viral replication studies. After implementation of HAART therapy on AIDS, the disease profiles of HIV related neurological diseases and HIV related dementia (HID) have been changed dramatically. In order to understand the mechanism of HID, we have compared the mechanism of the disease onset of HID with that of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraplegia (HAM/TSP), a retroviral related spinal cord disease. HAM/TSP occurs gradually after long incubation period of HTLV-I infection and mainly affects the middle age female, causing spastic paraplegia and urinary incontinence. One common feature of these two diseases is that these occur not in all infected individuals but in small numbers of them. This information has prompted us to compare virus loads and immunogenetic backgrounds in these two diseases. We have found that there are high provirus load before the onset of the diseases and correlation to certain genetic backgrounds. Not all genetic background has relation to the diseases but some have similar effect on the onset of the diseases. We have also found that HAM/ TSP showed minor mutation by dN/dS analysis, though HID showed high but different mutation rate in different compartment. There are high mutations in peripheral blood but low in brain. To find the appropriate therapy and to explore the disease mechanism of HID and HAM/TSP, we believe that comparing information so far obtained from research works of these two diseases is essential.",

Endothelium demonstrated strong BCRP staining in the HIV + or HIV \u2212 brains, while HIVE featured decreased BCRP endothelial labeling paralleling macrophage infiltration. Brain macrophages were positive for BCRP in HIVE, few macrophages showed weak BCRP staining in HIV + and none in HIV-samples. WB performed in the same brain tissues demonstrated 4.5-fold increase of CD68 (macrophage marker) and 18-fold increase of BCRP levels in HIVE (p < 0.02), and HIV + brains showed augmented levels of CD68 (1.8) and BCRP (6 times, p < 0.03) as compared to controls.

Objective: To elucidate the pathogenetic significance of anti-TPI antibody in ACA, we investigated fine specificity of the antibody and its antigenic epitope. Methods: We examined differences in the reactivity of the antibody against TPI and its protease-digested products among groups of ACA, EBV infection without ataxia (EBV-A(\u2212)) and TPI-immunized animal by Western blot. Results: There was a tendency that anti-TPI antibodies in ACA and EBV-A(\u2212) reacted more strongly with TPI from the cerebellar cortical tissue than with ones of the other tissues examined except muscle, compared with the antibodies obtained from TPI-immunized animals. Anti-TPI antibodies in ACA and EBV-A(\u2212) reacted approximately 18 kDa product of the protease-digested material mainly, although the antibodies from TPI-immunized animals reacted with products of various molecular weights. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the products revealed that a main antigenic epitope of the antibodies in ACA and EBV-A(\u2212) was present in the C-terminal 80-100 amino acid residues of TPI. Conclusions: Anti-TPI antibody following EBV infection would have a different epitope from ones of TPI-immunized animals. The facts that anti-TPI antibody from patients with ACA react more strongly with TPI of the cerebellar tissue suggests that the antibody could be related to the pathogenesis of ACA following EBV infection. Activation of microglia after severe seizures is commonly reported, but activation after a single seizure is poorly understood. Microglial cytokine production might account for recruitment of the lymphocytes found in brain after a seizure (Silverberg et al., 2005) . We studied early changes in brain microglia/macrophages after seizure induction by electrical stimulation. C57BL/6 mice (males, 6-8 weeks) received frontal lobe electrical stimulation (15-30 mA, 100 Hz, 0.4 ms train, 1 s duration). Maximal (hind-limb extension) tonic-clonic seizures lasted \u223c60 s, followed by reduced activity lasting \u223c5 min. Mice were perfused, brains harvested, cells separated on density gradients, and cell distributions determined by flow cytometry, using the following markers: CD11b (Mac-1) (activated microglia/macrophages), CD45 (CD45 Lo differentiating resident microglia from CD45 Hi labeled brain macrophages and leukocytes) and anti-MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1). CD11b + CD45 Lo and CD11b + CD45 Hi cells were used to specifically gate the brain microglia/macrophage population. Soon after stimulation (3 h) , the numbers of activated microglia/macrophages increased significantly, further increasing at 6hr, peaking at 24 h and decreasing by day 10. Interestingly, at 3-24 h, the CD11b + CD45 Hi cells contained MCP-1, a chemokine previously shown to recruit lymphocytes into inflammatory sites. By contrast, unstimulated mice had much lower numbers of activated microglia/macrophages detected in brain. Our results demonstrate that a single seizure induces early activation of brain microglia/macrophages producing MCP-1, which may recruit lymphocytes from blood into brain.",

The pathogenesis of HS has not been clearly understood. There are inflammatory factors taking part in the epileptogenesis. We planned to investigate the association between the gene polymorphisms of cytokines in Turkish patients with MTLE-HS. Materials and methods: DNA isolation was accomplished by using standard methods.IL-10, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, TGF-\u03b21b, IFN-\u03b3 were genotyped by using base-specific primers. The sera of 49 patients diagnosed as MTLE and 108 healthy individuals were included. The allele frequencies between groups were determined. In MTLE, the correlations between the genotype of cytokines and the onset of seizures or the presence of febrile seizures (FS) were investigated. The chi-square (\u03c7 2 ) or Fisher's exact test were used to analyze our data. Results: Our results suggest that IL-6 expression shows a significant difference between the patient and the control group (p < 0.05). The distribution of TNF-\u03b1, TGF-\u03b21b, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 genotypes was not significantly different between groups. The presence of high secretory allele of IL-10 was found to be correlated with less occurrence of FS (p = 0.044) and late-onset of epilepsy (p = 0.059).No statistically significant difference was found with respect to other alleles in patients with or without FS. Conclusion: We suggest that IL-6 polymorphisms may have an impact on the pathogenesis of HS in patients with MTLE.

To increase the stability and increase the therapeutic efficacy of such peptide sequences from MOG, we grafted them onto a framework of a particularly stable class of peptides, the cyclotides. They are a recently discovered family of cyclic plant peptides with superb intrinsic stability. The limitations of linear peptides as drugs due to their instability and poor bio-availability can be overcome by using the cyclotide scaffold as a framework for novel drug design, replacing several amino acids for a known peptide epitope active for the treatment of a particular disorder.The structures of the bioengineered peptides was studied with nuclear magnetic resonance and their activity of has been tested in vivo. They were tested for their immunogenicity, encephalitogenicity and protective activities by injecting them with IFA into mice (200 \u03bcg/per mouse per injection), 24, 16 and 8 days before the encephalitogenic challenge with MOG 35-55 . Eight weeks post-sensitisation, animals were killed, blood and lymph nodes removed for T and B cells studies (immunogenicity) and CNS tissue for histology (axonal damage, inflammation, demyelination). Several groups of mice injected with this kind of peptides showed a depression in the clinical score and did not fall ill. This is an exciting result that shows the first active bioengineered cyclotide in an animal model of disease. The structural information about these peptides will be used in conjunction with the results from the activity studies in a feedback loop to design second-generation lead molecules.",

Methods: We created a novel Swedish amyloid precursor protein mutant (APP) transgenic mouse where the IFN-\u03b3 receptor type I was knocked out (APP/GRKO). The animals were biochemically and neuropathologically examined at 14 months of age. To address the effect of IFN-\u03b3 on beta-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1), primary cultured astrocytes and microglia were infected with adenovirus expressing APP Swedish mutant and subjected to biochemical analysis. Results: IFN-\u03b3 signaling loss in the APP/GRKO mice reduced the extent of gliosis, the concentration of diffuse and compact A\u03b2 plaques, and the numbers of astrocytes expressing BACE1 when compared to its APP littermates. IFN-\u03b3-stimulation of mixed glial cultures elicited A\u03b2 production and increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 secretion from wild type (WT) but not GRKO mice. BACE1 expression is upregulated in astrocytes stimulated with TNF-\u03b1. Conclusions: These results suggest that glial activation enhances A\u03b2 deposition through upregulation of astroglial BACE1 by TNF-\u03b1 secreted by IFN-\u03b3 stimulated microglial cells. These data support the notion that proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 are critical for A\u03b2 production in AD.",

Methods: We examined whether T-cells activated by different stimulants affect the clearance of A\u03b2 using primary cultured human monocytederived macrophages. Pulse-chase labeling of aggregated 125 I-A\u03b240 and soluble 125 I-AcLDL, followed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation was employed to analyze the kinetics of their clearance by macrophages in vitro. Bone-marrow derived macrophages from APP transgenic mice and wild type littermates were also examined in the same experimental design. Results: Pulse-chase analysis demonstrated three distinct destinations of A\u03b240 and AcLDL: intracellular retention, degradation, and secretion. Fifty percent of A\u03b2 remains intracellular for as long as 5 days after the pulse, whereas the remaining 50% is secreted in either a degraded or an aggregated form in an approximate ratio of 4:1, respectively. Co-culturing of macrophages with activated T-cells resulted in a significantly increased A\u03b2 intracellular retention and a reduced extracellular degradation. Neutralizing antibodies against T-cell-mediated cytokines, such as IFN-\u03b3, soluble CD40L, and TNF-\u03b1, at least partially, recovered the T-cell mediated effect. Conclusions: These data suggest that the activated T-cells play a role in the suppression of A\u03b2 degradation in mononuclear phagocytes that is mediated through the secretion of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines. These discoveries are the first to provide a potential mechanism for T cellmediated mononuclear phagocyte A\u03b2 degradation.",

Nicoll a a Division of Clinical Neurosciences, b CNS Inflammation Group -University of Southampton, UK Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the commonest cause of dementia in ageing. Over the past decade many studies have focused on neuroinflammation as a harmful feature of AD, with the implication that antiinflammatory therapy may be beneficial. More recently, immunization with amyloid \u03b2-peptide (A\u03b2) has been proposed as a novel treatment for AD. Experimental models have shown that A\u03b2 accumulation in the brain, a key feature of the disease, can be reversed by immunotherapy mediated, at least in part, by phagocytosis by microglia, the cerebral macrophage. We are co-ordinating collaborative clinical and neuropathological follow-up of the patients who where in the original trial of A\u03b2 immunotherapy runs by Elan Pharmaceuticals which started in 2000. Immunohistochemical study of the immunized AD cases examined to date (n = 8) shows that the A\u03b2 plaque removal varies from patchy to almost complete clearance. Doublelabel confocal microscopy was performed with antibody to A\u03b2 and either CD68 (PG-M1; a protein located on microglial lysosomes which therefore reflects phagocytic activity) or HLA-DR (CR3/43; MHC class II). This showed that plaque removal is associated with the presence of A\u03b2 within the lysosomes of activated microglia, indicating that the A\u03b2 has been phagocytosed. In cases of unimmunized AD there was microglial Background. Neurosteroid hormones exert numerous and important effects within the CNS. Adult human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are a promising candidate cell population for use in reparative cellular therapy for neurological diseases, including MS. The observation that gender altered both the clinical course and therapeutic response of MS patients has stimulated much interest into the effects of steroid hormones in pathogenesis. In this study, we examined the neuroectodermal differentiation potential of hMSCs focusing particularly on the effects of neurosteroids in vitro. Methods. The presence of steroid hormone receptors, oestrogen receptors (ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2), progesterone receptors (PR) and androgen receptors (AR) on hMSCs were examined immunocytochemically. Subsequently, hMSCs both from male and female donors were cultured with 17-\u03b2 estradiol (E2), progesterone (PROG) or dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for 7 days. Cells were then examined for the presence of oligodendrocyte precursor markers (nestin, A2B5, NG2, PDGFR\u03b1, O4, GalC) using immunocytochemistry. Results. All neurosteroids examined, significantly modulated the expression of early oligodendrocyte markers. E2 and DHT had the most significant effects on female and male hMSCs, respectively. Maximal effects of E2 and DHT occurred at 100 nM concentration, whereas maximal effects of PROG were seen at 250 nM. The specific receptor antagonists abrogated the increase in A2B5-positive cells seen with E2, PROG and DHT (ICI182780, mifepristone and flutamide respectively) suggesting that ER\u03b1, ER\u03b2, PR and AR play a role in the differentiation of hMSCs. Conclusion. These results suggest a role for steroid hormones in the neuroectodermal differentiation of hMSCs and might have important implications for understanding and modulating tissue repair in MS.",

Ferrari 1 , Debora Giunti 1 , Gianluigi Mancardi 1,2 , Vito Pistoia 3 , Antonio Uccelli 1,2 Abstracts Toll-like receptors (TLR) are an integral part of an evolutionarily wellconserved pathway and have a dual role in embryogenesis and adult innate immune responses. Necrotic cells utilize the NF-\u03baB/TLR2 pathway to induce an inflammatory response which recruits neutrophils to remove damaged tissue and initiate tissue repair. The object of this study was to characterize innate immune responses in human embryonic stem (hES) cells during various phases of differentiation. This information would allow the design of stem cell populations that can function in tissue repair. NF-\u03baB activation and levels of TLR2 and NF-\u03baB inducing kinase (NIK) were evaluated in hES cells at multiple phases of differentiation to mature oligodendrocytes. Cells were harvested at days (0, 10, 21, 28, 35, and 42) . Gel shift mobility assay was used to identify the profile of activated NF-\u03baB dimers. Western blots were used to determine the levels of TLR2 and NIK. The levels of NF-\u03baB activation were highest at days 35 and 42. The activated dimers are principally composed of p50 and RelA proteins. In mice, expression of these two Rel proteins persists into adulthood in regions of neurogenesis. Both NIK and TLR2 levels are higher at the later phases of cell differentiation and thus may be mediating the activation of NF-\u03baB. These studies imply that hES cells at later phases of differentiation may have a regenerative profile. Future studies in vivo are necessary to determine the potential of these cells in the treatment of chronic neuroinflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis.",

However, recent investigations of OEC mediated regeneration have produced variable results. Using a wire knife lesion of the dorsal columns we have investigated whether OECs prepared using different methods influences the success of the regenerative response. Cells were prepared as follows (i) Neonatal nonpurified rat olfactory bulb cells transplanted as a suspension. (ii) FACSpurified neonatal rat OECs transplanted as a suspension. (iii) Adult nonpurified rat olfactory bulb cells transplanted either as a suspension or (iv) in their own matrix (Li et al. 2003, J. Neurosci. 23:721-731) . Two weeks after transplantation, all of the cell preparations had integrated well within the lesion promoting angiogenesis, cavity formation typically seen in control lesioned animals was prevented and a laminin-rich extracellular matrix deposited. Two weeks after lesioning all grafts promoted axonal regeneration into the graft (neurofilament labelling). BDA tracing of ascending dorsal column axons, which allowed individual fibres to be followed, showed that regenerating fibres remained within the transplant even after 3 months. Furthermore L4 dorsal root-evoked cord dorsum potentials (CDPs) of the local collaterals and propriospinal systems assessed electrophysiologically for transplants of adult mixed olfactory bulb cells were enhanced caudal to the lesion suggesting a neuroprotective effect.In summary: (1) The composition of cell transplants containing OECs is not critical for successful regeneration; (2) Regeneration of the sensory fibres within the dorsal columns is restricted to the environment of the cell transplant, and (3) Olfactory cells can exert a neuroprotective effect.",

Neveu.Inserm U643, 44093 Nantes, France Xenogeneic neural cells are rejected within 5-7 weeks following their transplantation into the brain. The rejection process is accompanied by an infiltration of the graft by macrophages/microglial cells, and a sudden apparition of T lymphocytes but to date, nothing is known about a potential role of dendritic cells (DCs) whose major function is antigen presentation to T cells (APC). To study this possibility, rats were sacrificed at days 3, 8, 28, 42 and 63 following the transplantation of porcine ventral mesencephalic cells into their striatum and the presence of DCs were analysed by immunohistochemistry using O \u00d7 62 monoclonal antibody. The high number of DCs infiltrating the grafted striatum at day 42 while the graft is being rejected, give credence to a role of DCs in the rejection of xenogeneic neurons. Interestingly, some DCs were detected as early as day 3 post-grafting. This suggests an early role of DCs in xenograft rejection. In particular, they may initiate the porcine antigen-directed immune response since these APCs have the unique ability to prime naive T cells. Further studies are required to confirm this hypothesis but our present data provide new perspectives concerning the mechanisms of cell rejection in the brain.",

One strategy to overcoming this limitation would be to determine the optimal delivery route leading to significant beneficial effects both in early (prophylactic) and late (therapeutic) treatments. To address this issue, we directly compared the effects of intrasplenic (IS) and intramuscular (IM) electro-transfer of interleukin-4 (IL-4) DNA in the rat EAE model. Macroscopic analysis indicated that the onset of moderate to severe EAE in rats treated with IS transfer of IL-4 DNA (25 \u03bcg) was prevented on a significant level compared with IM 25 \u03bcg of the IL-4 DNA transfer group or the control group in the preventive experiments. More importantly, IS transfer of IL-4 DNA (25 \u03bcg) considerably suppressed the severity of EAE in late treatment experiments while IM transfer of IL-4 DNA (150 \u03bcg) had little effect. The MBP-specific expression of IFN-\u03b3 from stimulated splenocytes was considerably decreased by the IS IL-4 DNA transfer group both in the preventive and therapeutic experiments while IM transfer had this effect only in the preventive protocol. Histological analysis showed that spinal cord inflammation was considerably reduced in the IS IL-4 DNA transfer group. These data provide the first demonstration that IS electro-transfer of IL-4 DNA is more effective both in the prevention and modulation of EAE than IM transfer and that IS electro-gene transfer may present a new approach to cytokine therapy in autoimmune diseases.",
