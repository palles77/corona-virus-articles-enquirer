The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that physicians have at least one patient-applied treatment option for the treatment of external genital and perianal warts. 1 Patients apply imiquimod 5% cream at bedtime three times a week until warts are gone or for as long as 16 weeks. The treated area should be washed with mild soap and water 6 to 10 hours after application. Many patients may be clear of warts after 8 to 10 weeks or sooner. Patients should be informed that new warts may develop during treatment, that the effect of imiquimod 5% cream on the transmission of genital warts is unknown, and that, because imiquimod 5% cream may weaken latex condoms and diaphragms, sexual contact should be avoided while the cream is on the skin. The efficacy and safety of imiquimod 5% cream were evaluated in multicenter, double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled, parallel-design trials. Approximately 900 male and female patients with external genital and/or perianal warts have been evaluated in a clinical trial setting with imiquimod 5% cream.",
