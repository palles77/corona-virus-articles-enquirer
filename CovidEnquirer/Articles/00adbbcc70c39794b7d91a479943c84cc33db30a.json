Maintaining optimal immune function for the prevention of infectious diseases requires good management practices to prevent suppression of the immune system and sound vaccination practices to induce optimal acquired immunity. This article briefly reviews the basic types of immunity, the factors relevant to feedlot cattle that have been shown to suppress immune function, and what is known about the basis of protective acquired immunity against the common bovine respiratory pathogens that cause significant losses in feedlot animals.",

            "text": "The term cell-mediated immunity refers to immunity mediated primarily by T lymphocytes. The T lymphocytes have two basic methods for protecting animals from disease. Some lymphocytes called \"cytotoxic T cells\" make contact with cells presenting foreign antigens on their surface such as viral antigens or antigens from some intracellular bacteria. The T cells specifically recognize the foreign antigens and kill the cell that has them on its surface. This effectively prevents virus from replicating in the cell. The second method that T cells use to fight infection is to secrete cytokines. Cytokines are glycoprotein molecules that activate other cells of the immune system to be more aggressive. This includes macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer lymphocytes. The activated macrophages and neutrophils are more efficient at killing bacteria, especially facultative intracellular bacterial pathogens like brucella, mycobacteria, salmonella, and listeria. The activated natural killer cells are more efficient at killing virus-infected cells. The T cells that secrete cytokines to enhance killing by macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer cells are called \"T-helper I\" cells. T lymphocytes are also essential for secreting cytokines which control the type and amount of antibody produced by B lymphocytes. These T cells are called liT-helper 2\" cells. Therefore, production of a normal antibody response requires T-Iymphocyte help. The activity of the T-helper 2 cells is not usually considered to be part of cell-mediated immunity.",

The antibodies responsible for humoral immunity and the white blood cells responsible for cell-mediated immunity are found in the bloodstream and in the tissues to some extent, including submucosal surfaces; however, they are not found on some mucosal surfaces. Therefore, they can help to prevent invasion through the mucosal surface but are not very effective at controlling infection on the mucosal surface. On some mucosal surfaces such as the lower respiratory tract, reproductive tract, and mammary gland, where IgG and white blood cells are found in relative abundance, they are able to provide a significant amount of protection, but they are not able to function as effectively as in the bloodstream and tissues. Protection on mucosal surfaces is due, in large part, to a special class of antibody called \"secretory IgA.\" Secretory IgA tends to be produced in response to pathogens that enter through a mucosal surface. Secretory IgA is secreted onto mucosal surfaces, where it may bind to mucus and be present in fairly high concentrations. Secretory IgA is resistant to destruction by the proteolytic enzymes on mucosal surfaces that are capable of breaking down IgA and IgM. IgA is the predominant immunoglobulin found in the milk of monogastrics and is important for protecting the gastrointestinal tract of the neonate from pathogens. In ruminants, IgGl is the predominant class of antibody in the milk for protecting the gastrointestinal tract of the newborn. Mucosal surfaces of ruminants tend to have high concentrations of IgGl as well as IgA.",

            "text": "The bovine respiratory disease (BRD) complex has been extensively investigated in recent years, and numerous vaccines and antibiotics have been developed and prescribed for its control. Despite these efforts, BRD is still a major problem, and its pathogenesis and etiology are incompletely understood. Respiratory disease is particularly prevalent during the first 45 days after calves have been weaned, transported, and placed in a feedlot (i.e., shipping fever). 49 The economically important clinical signs, lesions, and death loss in shipping fever usually can be attributed to bacterial pneumonia due to Pasteurella haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, or Haemophilus somnus. These bacteria are commonly found in the nasopharyngeal area of healthy animals. Under normal conditions, the bacteria are unable to move into the lower respiratory tract and cause pneumonia. In fact, the lungs of normal healthy cattle can withstand a challenge with surprisingly large numbers of these bacteria without serious consequences. If the animal is stressed, however, has a respiratory viral infection, or is otherwise immunosuppressed, a severe pneumonia can be established by a relatively small number of bacteria. These observations have led to the concept that BRD has a multifactorial etiology involving a complex interaction between stressors, viruses, and perhaps other immunosuppressive factors that act separately or together to suppress the defense mechanisms in the lung and predispose the animal to bacterial pneumonia.",

Cortisol is responsible for many (but not all) of the effects of distress on the immune system. Several stressors that are sometimes associated with the introduction of cattle to a feedlot have been proven to result in increased plasma cortisol levels. These conditions include castration and dehorning, weaning, handling, forced exercise, acute pain, and transportation. 2 , 23, 41, 97, 99,102 There is evidence that high plasma cortisol concentrations affect several aspects of host defense,89 including decreased antibody response to primary immunization, decreased lymphocyte function leading to impaired cell-mediated immunity, and an inhibition of phagocytic cell ability to enter the tissues and destroy bacteria. The levels of endorphins, catecholamines, insulin, glucagon, growth hormone, prolactin, thyroid hormones, and melatonin are also altered by stress. These hormones may alter immune function as well, but their effects on the immune system are not understood as well as those of cortisol.",

            "text": "A very important effect of elevated cortisol concentration or the administration of pharmacologic doses of glucocorticoids (e.g., dexamethasone) is the recrudescence of herpesviruses such as bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHVl). BHVI can be recrudesced in otherwise healthy cattle by stress or dexamethasone treatment; this can be done even if the animal has an antibody titer. The recrudescence of a latent BHVI infection in an animal under stress can lead to the spread of BHVI throughout a herd. Like other herpesviruses, BHVI is harbored in a latent state in animals that have recovered from an initial infection. Even a modified live virus (MLV) vaccine strain can be recrudesced and shed under the influence of glucocorticoids. 80 One clinical application of dexamethasone has been in the treatment of cattle suffering from bronchial pneumonia to reduce the inflammatory response in the lungs. A short-term improvement in clinical signs often occurs; however, experimentation has shown that when dexamethasone administration was combined with antibacterial and antihistamine therapy for the treatment of bronchial pneumonia in cattle, the outcome was a poorer response to treatment, more relapses, and greater death losses.\u00b7 This occurred because in decreasing the inflammatory response in the lung, the dexamethasone also impaired the activity of the host defense mechanisms, thus allowing increased bacterial replication. 17 In general, glucocorticoids should not be used as a part of the treatment regimen for BRD unless the inflammatory response in the lung is life threatening or the clinician is confident that the antimicrobial agent being used can control the bacterial infection.",

            "text": "The best evidence that viruses play an important role in predisposing to bacterial pneumonia comes from epidemiologic data indicating that a recent serologic conversion to a respiratory virus is associated with bacterial pneumonia and from challenge experiments in which cattle are infected with a virus and then infected a few days later with an aerosol of P. haemolytica or P. multocida. 90 The cattle that are preinfected with either BHVl, parainfluenza 3 (PI3) virus, or bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) virus develop a severe bacterial pneumonia, although the nonvirus-infected control cattle are able to clear the bacteria from their lungs. These viruses may have a number of effects on the antibacterial defense mechanisms in the lung, including impairment of mucociliary clearance, suppression of phagocytic cell function, and interference with lymphocyte function. The relative importance of each of these effects is not known, but it is probably a combination of activities that is responsible for the predisposition to bacterial pneumonia. Studies have shown that simultaneous infection with BVD virus and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) can synergistically increase the pathologic effects of each individual virus. 57 A number of respiratory viruses of cattle can inhibit mucociliary clearance in the ciliated respiratory epithelium (e.g., BHVl, PI3 virus, BVD virus, BRSV).90 Decreased mucociliary clearance is often cited as a primary reason for greater susceptibility to bacterial pneumonia. Evidence suggests, however, that this is not as important as impairment of bactericidal mechanisms within the lung. This conclusion is based on the observations that the rate of bacterial killing within the healthy lung greatly exceeds the rate of mucociliary transport out of the lungs and that the period of increased susceptibility to bacterial pneumonia does not coincide with the timing of the inhibition of mucociliary clearance after viral infection. 48 The current consensus seems to be that suppression of the function of phagocytic cells in the lungs (both alveolar macrophages and neutrophils) is a primary factor in predisposing to bacterial infection. The phagocytic cells are essential for killing bacteria that find their way to the lower respiratory tract and removing them from the lung. The alveolar macrophage is the predominant phagocyte in the healthy lung and is very important in surveillance and removal of foreign material (including bacteria) from the alveoli. If the alveolar macrophages are unable to control the infection or if the lung is exposed to a large challenge dose of bacteria, neutrophils migrate into the alveoli and bronchioles rapidly, and they soon (within a few hours) become the predominant cell type. Neutrophils are quite active phagocytic ally and have potent bactericidal mechanisms, including the generation of toxic oxygen products (e.g., hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical) and the release of cationic antibacterial peptides and hydrolytic enzymes. In addition to being bactericidal, these products also can damage pulmonary tissue. If the infection is not brought under control relatively rapidly, the neutrophils can induce considerable damage in the lung.",

An important aspect of alveolar macrophage and neutrophil function is that they can be activated by cytokines secreted by T lymphocytes. When these phagocytes are activated, they become more \"aggressive\" and are more effective at controlling bacterial infection. By interfering with lymphocyte function, the BRD viruses may inhibit alveolar macrophage and neutrophil activation and leave the animal more susceptible to bacterial pneumonia.",

The characteristics of protective immunity against BHVI are similar to those against other alpha herpesviruses. Antibody titers as measured by a serum neutralization (SN) test can protect the animal against infection. The evidence for this is that the passive antibodies that a calf receives from the colostrum can provide solid protection against infectious challenge. The passively acquired antibody can also prevent an MLV vaccine from inducing an antibody response in a calf. This maternal antibody blockage of an MLV vaccine can even occur if the serum neutralizing titer is very low. If the calf receives a lot of colostrum with a high titer against BHV1, it may be 6 to 8 months old before it is capable of responding to an MLV vaccine by the production of antibody. Even though the MLV vaccine may not induce an antibody response, it is possible that it may induce a memory response in the face of maternal antibody so that if the calf is subsequently exposed to the virulent virus, it may be capable of responding more rapidly to the viral challenge and have some degree of protection. There is evidence to indicate that vaccination in the presence of maternal antibody against pseudorabies virus in pigs (another alpha herpesvirus) stimulates immunologic memory even though an antibody response does not occur. This immunologic memory has been shown to provide partial protection against disease challenge with pseudorabies virus in pigS. 111 There is also evidence that the same is likely to be true for MLV BHVl vaccines used in the presence of maternal antibody in calves. 30 ,70 An important characteristic of herpesviruses is that after an animal recovers from disease, it is latently infected with the virus for the rest of its life. The virus resides in ganglia of nerves in a quiescent state. Even MLV BHVl vaccine has been shown to latently infect cattle. 3o The immune system is not capable of clearing this latent infection. If the animal is stressed or treated with glucocorticoids later in life, the virus is likely to recrudesce and be shed even if the animal has a high serum neutralizing antibody titer. 30, 93, 106 Therefore, serum neutralizing antibody can prevent infection, but it cannot prevent recrudescence and shedding of the latent BHVl. The latently infected animal that is shedding BHVl may not show any clinical signs but is a source of infection for other animals in the herd.",

The E2 gene of BVD codes for the CPS3 protein. This is the major surface glycoprotein and is immunodominant for antibody production. It is a major epitope for virus neutralization. The E2 gene represents one of the hypervariable regions of the BVD virus genome. This hypervariability may be due to selective pressure from the immune system. 26 The heterogeneity of the CPS3 protein (and other less important virus neutralizing epitopes) limits the ability of an antibody response to one strain of BVD virus to protect against a wide array of other possible strains that the animal may be exposed to. The SN antibody titer of a single serum sample may vary from 10-to 100-fold depending on which BVD virus isolate is used in the SN assay. 12, 27 The animal is probably protected against the isolates that the serum can neutralize at a titer of approximately 1 to 32 or greater, but the antibody in the serum cannot protect against the other isolates of BVD virus. In a field outbreak, it is impossible to predict which antigenic type of BVD virus the animal is going to be exposed to.

If this is true, an animal that has developed cell-mediated immunity has better protection against BVD virus challenge. Because MLV vaccines are more likely to induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes than are killed vaccines, they may provide better cross-protective immunity to a variety of BVD virus isolates. This hypothesis fits the commonly held perception that MLV vaccines provide better immunity to BVD virus than killed vaccines, but it remains to be proven experimentally. Recently, two separate genotypes of BVD virus have been defined,88 type 1 and type 2. The type-2 BVD viruses have the potential to produce severe acute infection even in adult animals.

Although not documented, the use of different strains or serotypes of MLV vaccine for each injection has been proposed so as to expand the range of cross protection. The genetic and antigenic instability of BVD virus may result in the emergence of isolates that have reduced antigenic cross reactivity. 20, 56 The importance of the specificity of circulating antibody and effects on cellular immunity due to viral mutation are largely unanswered at this time.",

The opportunities for planned vaccination at noncritical stages of production and during times of minimal stress are available. This makes infection from field strain viruses during critical periods of fetal development less likely. If immunity has declined enough to permit natural infection, it may stimulate an immediate immune response without severe disease consequences, and this may be the basis for maintaining long-term immunity. 53 Depending on the circumstances of each herd, annual, biannual, or less frequent MLV vaccine injections to cows between calving and breeding may be recommended.",

Because recovery from natural infection with respiratory syncytial virus does not engender protective immunity in most species, it is unlikely that vaccination can prevent subsequent infection. Nevertheless, it may still be possible for vaccination to attenuate clinical signs of subsequent infections and reduce time to recovery. One experimental challenge of a small number of calves showed that passive antibodies reduce the pathology associated with BRSV.8 Moreover, there are reports of improvement in gain and feed efficiency.3 Mixed results are reported from studies investigating clinical efficacy of BRSV vaccination of calves on arrival. A statistically significant benefit of BRSV vaccination was shown in auction-or market-purchased and transported calves, with vaccinated calves being two times less likely to be treated for BRD complex (OR=2.0, P<O.OOOOl). Freshly weaned and transported calves were 1.4 times less likely to be treated for BRD complex (OR = 1.4; P<O.OOl). A statistically significant benefit of BRSV vaccination was not shown in the two classes of calves with low morbidity. These included preconditioned calves (P = 0.11) and freshly weaned calves that were not transported (P = 0.75).42 In a Canadian study, results of five separate trials designed to assess BRSV vaccine efficacy were equivocal for calves vaccinated before weaning; however, reduction of treatment rate was reported in calves vaccinated on arrival. No benefit was found for vaccination on arrival of yearling cattle.l1o Two additional trials involving calves 5 ,73 and one trial involving stocker cattle 50 failed to demonstrate a benefit of BRSV vaccination on arrival.

Assuming valid design, execution, and analysis, interpretation of the first group is fairly straightforward. Some studies of arrival vaccination suggest that it does not affect or may even compromise health performance. A well-designed study using IBR MLV and PI3 virus vaccine along with a P. haemolytica toxoid failed to show health performance benefits. 6 This is supported by findings in a multiyear observational study in Ontario, Canada, which reported that administration of respiratory vaccines (IBR virus, IBR-PI3 virus, or IBR-PI3-Pasteurella sp. virus) to calves vaccinated within 2 weeks of arrival was associated with an increased risk of mortality (RR = 2.4). 67 In contrast, subcutaneous vaccination with a P. haemolytica and H. somnus vaccine on arrival reduced BRD complex morbidity from 41 % to 29%. 109 The second type of mixed antigen study is when vaccines are administered several weeks before feedlot arrival. These are often part of a preconditioning or preweaning study. Because an unvaccinated but similarly managed group is rarely included in these studies, the effects of management interventions such as preweaning and bunk acclimation are totally confounded with vaccine effect.
