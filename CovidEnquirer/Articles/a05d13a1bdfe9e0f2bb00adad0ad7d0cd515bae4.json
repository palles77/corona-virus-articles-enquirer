Fecal changes are frequent and can be signs of infection by digestive pathogens (bacteria, viruses, parasites) and indicators of nutritional and environmental stress. The aim of this study was to define a pathological fecal score for weaning puppies, and to study the impact on that score of two intestinal viruses (canine parvovirus type 2 and canine coronavirus). For this, the quality of stools was evaluated on 154 puppies between 4 and 8 weeks of age (100 from small breeds and 54 from large breeds). The scoring was performed immediately after a spontaneous defecation based on a 13-point scale (from 1; liquid to 13; dry and hard feces). Fecal samples were frozen for further viral analysis. Each puppy was weighed once a week during the study period. The fecal score regarded as pathological was the highest score associated with a significant reduction in average daily gain (ADG). Fecal samples were checked by semi-quantitative PCR or RT-PCR for canine parvovirus type 2 and canine coronavirus identification, respectively. The quality of feces was affected by both age and breed size. In small breeds, the ADG was significantly reduced under a fecal score of 6 and 7 for puppies at 4-5 and 6-8 weeks of age, respectively. In large breeds, the ADG was significantly reduced under a fecal score of 5 whatever the age of the puppy. Whereas a high viral load of canine parvovirus type 2 significantly impacted feces quality, no effect was recorded for canine coronavirus. This study provides an objective threshold for evaluation of fecal quality in weaning puppies. It also emphasizes the importance to be given to age and breed size in that evaluation.",

These scales are divided in 4-10 points, with lower grades corresponding to either dry feces or diarrhea, and with an optimal fecal score varying from 2 to 7.5 (Rolfe et al., 2002a,b; Hernot et al., 2005; Allenspach et al., 2007) .

All these factors can affect feces quality and reduce the average daily gain (ADG). Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV2) is frequently isolated in puppies from shelters (Marshall et al., 1984; Vanparijs et al., 1991; Naylor et al., 2001) and was reported to have a major impact on feces quality at weaning (Schulz et al., 2008) . Canine coronavirus (CCV) is also frequently identified in the feces of puppies but its role in the etiology of acute diarrhea remains controversial (Tennant et al., 1993; Yesilbag et al., 2004) . Since weaning is a high risk period for puppies, a tool for precise follow-up of digestive health would be most useful. Scoring systems used in adult dogs cannot be applied to young puppies because of a physiological lower fecal quality prior to the weaning period (Giffard et al., 2004) . No study has defined an abnormal fecal score during the weaning period. The objectives of this study were thus to determine in puppies a threshold in fecal score that could be regarded as pathological, based on its correlation with a drop average daily gain, and to evaluate the association between pathological scores and digestive infection by CPV2 or CCV.",

Five microliters of eluate was used for PCR and absence of PCR inhibitors was checked for (Table 2) . For CPV2, viral load levels have been determined in asymptomatic non-vaccinated, asymptomatic vaccinated or diseased dogs with confirmed parvovirosis (histolopathologic exam and/or positive testing using antigen assays). High and very high viral loads as defined in Table 2 are typical loads in dogs with parvovirosis and correlated to positive antigen testing and detection of wild-type strains of virus, i.e. CPV2a, b or c (unpublished results). In vaccinated dogs the CPV2 viral loads are mostly low or very low but sometimes may be medium especially when the dog has been vaccinated a few days before sampling with high-titer vaccines. Whatever the vaccine used we neither obtained high viral loads of vaccine strain even in the days after vaccination (unpublished results). As far as CCV is concerned, the viral load levels have been arbitrary defined on the basis of several hundreds of tests in asymptomatic or diarrheic puppies from different breeds.",

The maternally derived antibodies (MDA), acquired by ingestion of immunoglobulin-rich colostrum, are essential for the protection of puppies against neonatal infection and death (Day, 2007) . However during the weaning period, MDAs may interfere with an active immune response to vaccine administration, but the low titers do not prevent infection with a virulent virus (Chappuis, 1998) . So puppies are sensitive to infection by intestinal pathogens such as parvoviruses. Most earlier studies considered only the aspects of feces (consistency, color. . .) to define \"diarrhea\" and to evaluate the impact of enteropathogens on feces quality (Finlaison, 1995; Del Amo et al., 1999; Sokolow et al., 2005) . However, young puppies have a higher fecal moisture content (Weber et al., 2003) and a lower fecal quality (Giffard et al., 2004) which may be related to a relatively low total mucosal surface (Paulsen et al., 2003) or to faster gastric emptying (Miyabayashi and Morgan, 1991; Weber et al., 2002) . So, digestive disorders may be overestimated in studies considering all soft feces as abnormal. An objective definition of abnormal feces in puppies appeared desirable. This study was designed to propose a fecal scoring scale for puppies in the weaning period, i.e. at 6-8 weeks of age and to provide an objective definition of an abnormal fecal score, based on a reduction in the average daily weight gain.",

This made it possible to study the effect of breed size on the fecal score. Large breed puppies had more frequently soft and unformed feces. Such an effect of breed size has already been reported in adult dogs. In large breed dogs, such as German shepherds or Great Danes, the fecal moisture content is higher, soft stools are more frequent and the number of defecations is higher than in small breeds (Weber et al., 2001 (Weber et al., , 2002 (Weber et al., , 2003 Hernot et al., 2006) . This difference may be due to a lower mineral absorption and/or to higher fermentative activity reflecting higher intestinal colic permeability and a longer colic transit time, respectively (Herschel et al., 1981; Kirkwood, 1985; Meyer et al., 1993 Meyer et al., , 1999 Rolfe et al., 2002a; Weber et al., 2004) . Distinct pathological thresholds were determined in our study for small and large breeds ( Table 3 ). The proposed definition of abnormal fecal score, based on a reduction in ADG, makes it possible to balance the effects of age and breed size (Fig. 2) . The relationship between infection by enteropathogens and abnormal fecal scores, whatever the age and breed size of puppies, can then be investigated.",

Both viruses were isolated from all feces samples collected. Earlier serological and virological studies had demonstrated that puppies and dogs from kennels and animal shelters are particularly exposed to these infections (Rimmelzwaan et al., 1991; Tennant et al., 1993; Bandai et al., 1999; Naylor et al., 2001; Yesilbag et al., 2004; Schulz et al., 2008) . The high prevalence observed here reflects the high contagiosity of these two viruses. Whereas viruses identified in the feces may sign the excretion of a wild viral strain, the low level of CPV2 detected in 87.3% of the feces may also result from vaccination. Puppies in our study were vaccinated at 5, 6, and 7 weeks of age with a non-adjuvant, modified livevaccine containing a type 2 parvovirus strain. The use of such vaccines has been associated with fecal excretion of Fig. 4 .

This virus is a common pathogen in dogs, but its actual role in acute dog diarrhea remains controversial (Tennant et al., 1993; Yesilbag et al., 2004 ). An interaction between CCV and CPV2 (aggravation of clinical signs in dogs infected by both viruses) was observed in 8 week old puppies under experimental condition (Appel, 1988) .
