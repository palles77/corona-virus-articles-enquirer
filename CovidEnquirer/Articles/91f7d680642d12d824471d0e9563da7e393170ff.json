The present study introduces a hybrid DES-Lagrangian and RANS-Eulerian model for simulating transient particle transport in enclosed environments; this hybrid model can ensure the accuracy and reduce the computing cost. Our study estimated two key time constants for the model that are important parameters for reducing the computing costs. The two time constants estimated were verified by airflow data from both an office and an aircraft cabin case. This study also conducted experiments in the first-class cabin of an MD-82 commercial airliner with heated manikins to validate the hybrid model. A pulse particle source was applied at the mouth of an index manikin to simulate a cough. The particle concentrations versus time were measured at the breathing zone of the other manikins. The trend of particle concentrations versus time predicted by the hybrid model agrees with the experimental data. Therefore, the proposed hybrid model can be used for investigating transient particle transport in enclosed environments.",

Breathing, coughing, talking, and sneezing by an infected person can generate pathogen-carrying particles and can cause the transmission of infectious diseases [2, 3] . Furthermore, infectious disease transmission in commercial aircraft cabins where passengers are in close proximity has become a major health issue [4] . Exhaled pathogencontaining particles generated by an infected passenger can disseminate throughout the cabin and cause infections in fellow passengers [5, 6] . Therefore, it is important to accurately model the person-to-person particle transport in mechanical ventilated spaces in order to improve air distribution design to reduce the infection risk.",

            "text": "In recent years, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has been widely used in modeling airflow field and particle transport in enclosed environments, such as buildings [7] , aircraft cabins [8] , and hospital rooms [9] . For airflow modeling, there are several turbulence models such as Reynolds-averaged NaviereStokes (RANS) models, Large Eddy Simulation (LES), and Detached Eddy Simulation (DES), which have that has been reviewed and tested [10, 11] . For particle modeling, Eulerian and Lagrangian are two popular methods. The Eulerian method often uses the drift flux model for considering the slippage between particle phase and fluid (air) phase. This model performed well in modeling indoor particle dispersion [12e14] . The Lagrangian method with the Discrete Random Walk (DRW) model has also performed very well in modeling and analyzing the particle transport and dispersion [15e17] . Most of the studies mentioned above focused on steadystate particle transport processes. However, particle transport processes can be in an unsteady state. Wang et al. [18] have tested different combinations of the airflow and particle models for steady-and unsteady-state cases. For steady-state airflow conditions, they preferred the RANS model with the Eulerian method due to the reasonable accuracy and low computing cost associated with the model. For unsteady-state airflow conditions, Wang et al. recommended the DES model with the Lagrangian method due to its relatively high accuracy. The reason for using DES rather than RANS model is that RANS model fails to predict correct transient airflow [11] . Moreover, when the airflow field is still developing, the Lagrangian method may have better accuracy than the Eulerian method since it accounts for more physics of airflow and particle motion [18] . But if the DES with Lagrangian model is applied for studying coughing, talking, and sneezing among persons in an enclosed environment, it requires considerable computing cost.",

Approach_3: only DES model, Approach_2a averaged the results between 0.5s and 1.5s as the mean flow field, which was the approach proposed in the previous section. Similarly, Approach_2b averaged the results between 2s and 3s as the mean flow field. When Approach_3 was used, the investigation calculated the airflow fields for 2s with a uniform initial flow field and then averaged the results between 2s and 3s to obtain the mean flow field. Since normally a flow will become stable again after the corresponding boundary conditions have been changed for 2s, we expected that both Approach_2b and Approach_3 could provide an accurate airflow field as a benchmark. Fig. 6 compares the air velocities obtained by the different approaches with the experimental data from Zhang and Chen [15] for the office case. Approach_1 and Approach_3 performed similarly at poles V3eV6. Approach_1 matched better with the experimental data in the middle part of pole V1, but worse at the lower part of pole V1 and middle part of pole V2 than in Approach_3. At pole V7, both the approaches showed significant discrepancies from the experimental data. Therefore, it is difficult to say which approach is better for predicting the airflow field in this case. Since the DES model can provide detailed information on transitional flows, this study used Approach_3 as the benchmark. As shown in the figure, Approach_2b agreed very well with Approach_3. This further confirms that Approach_3 can be used as the benchmark. To verify the t 1 proposed in the previous section, this investigation compared Approach_2a with Approach_3. The results show that they matched very well for the whole field. Although Approach_2a still showed significant discrepancies from the experimental data, it can at least achieve the similar accuracy to Approach_3. Hence, t 1 \u00bc 0.5s was long enough to obtain the accurate time-dependent flow distribution under steady-state boundary conditions. This study has correctly estimated the t 1 for the office case. Fig. 7 compares the airflow fields obtained by the different approaches with the experimental data from Zhang et al. [16] for the cabin case. For easy observation, only Approach_2a and Approach_3 were shown in the figure. It can be seen that Approach_3 showed significant discrepancies from the experimental data. Zhang et al. [16] also reported this phenomenon and concluded that the modeling results were very sensitive to the accuracy of the boundary conditions. It should be noted that the velocity directions at the inlets were not measured in the experiments, which may generate errors for quantitative comparison. Nevertheless, the experimental data still preserved the qualitative character of the airflow field. Similar to in the office case, this investigation used Approach_3 as the benchmark. To verify the t 1 proposed in the previous section, this study compared Approach_2a with Approach_3. In the midsection along the longitudinal direction, both the approaches predicted an upward motion of the airflow field. The quantitative comparison also showed very good agreement in this section. In the cross-section through the third row, both the approaches again matched well with each other for most of the positions. Although differences can be found at some positions at the upper left side of this section, the general airflow pattern was similar between the two approaches. Generally speaking, Approach_2a agreed well with Approach_3. Thus, t 1 \u00bc 0.5s is a reasonable estimate for the cabin case.",

Sub-Section 3.1 has shown that the DES model can be used as a benchmark. Hence, the DES model was used to calculate the jet velocity versus time at different positions. Then the time needed for the jet velocity decreased to the surrounding value can be obtained from the DES results as a benchmark to verify the t 2 proposed. The arrows in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively, show the mouth location and coughing direction. Table 1 lists the input parameters and the estimated t 2 . According to Eq. (12), the jet was associated with the coughing velocity (U 0 ) and the diameter of the mouth (d 0 ). The U 0 was set as 8 m/s for both cases, while the d 0 was set as 4 and 1 cm for the office and cabin cases, respectively, to create jets with different characteristics. The two cases with different jet characteristics are useful to verify the t 2 estimated in the previous section. Fig. 8 shows the results of the jet velocity versus time at different positions from the DES model for both the office and cabin cases. It can be seen from the table that the influence of the t decay on the t 2 was dominating for both the office and cabin cases. This was supported by the DES model calculation as shown in Fig. 8 . The t 2 was estimated to be 6.22 and 2.55 s through Eq. (21) for the office and cabin cases, respectively. The estimated t 2 for the office case was larger than the cabin case, which was also supported by the DES modeling results. As shown in Fig. 8(a) , after the estimated t 2 , 6.22 s, the air velocity had decreased to the surrounding value for the office case. Similarly, after the estimated t 2 , 2.55 s, the air velocity had decreased to the surrounding value for the cabin case, as shown in Fig. 8(b) . The two cases with different jet characteristics show that the t 2 estimated by Eq. (21) is acceptable. Hence, the t 2 Fig. 6 . Comparison of air velocities obtained by the different approaches with the experimental data from Zhang and Chen [15] . can be used as the minimum time in which a cough can affect the room airflow distribution.",

Since only one particle sizer spectrometer was available, the particle concentrations versus time were measured for one passenger at a time. The measurement time for each passenger was set as 500 s, so the entire experiment for measuring 11 passengers took about 2 h. The complete experiment was repeated 3 times on different days.

With such a short source release time in the experiment, the particle concentrations in the cabin may be too low to be detected by the aerodynamic particle sizer, so the data quality would be poor. Therefore, the source release time should be increased to some extent. Although the increased source release time was different from the real coughing case, the experiment was still meaningful since the aim of this study was to provide reliable experimental data to validate the hybrid model. If the source release time had been too long, the experiment might have become a steady-state case. Hence, the source release time still needs to be as short as possible to meet the purpose of this study, while the particle concentrations at the breathing zone of other manikins should be detectable with the aerodynamic particle sizer. This investigation compared the particle concentration versus time at 1A and 2A under three different source release times: 5, 20, and 60 s, as shown in Fig. 11 . It can be seen that a 5 s source release time cannot result in obvious particle concentration peaks. A 20 s source release time can generate a peak concentration that is more than 5 times the background concentration. Although a 60 s source release time can result in even higher peaks, this may be too long for a transient particle transport case. Hence, a 20 s source release time was applied in the experiment.",

The numerical simulation was conducted using the CFD code ANSYS Fluent 12.1. The user-defined function (UDF) was implemented to realize the Eulerian drift flux model. Three grid resolutions (6.4, 8.4 , and 13 million) were tested for CFD grid independence. The 6.4 million grid resolution was sufficiently fine to capture such a flow. When using the Lagrangian method, 500,000 particles with a diameter of 3 mm were generated during the 20 s source release time. The particle source in-cell (PSI-C) scheme [15] was used to translate the trajectories into the concentrations. The time step was set at 0.02 s. The particle deposition was neglected in the simulations due to the large air change rate in the aircraft cabin [8] . The t 1 and t 2 was estimated to be 51 and 22.3 s by using Eqs. (10) and (21), respectively, for the cabin. Fig. 12 compares the numerical results of the transient particle concentrations at the breathing zone of each passenger with the corresponding experimental data. For easy observation, the experimental data were averaged every 15 s. Since the experiment was repeated 3 times, each solid point in the figure represents the average value of the 45 data points (15 \u00c2 3 \u00bc 45). The lower and upper bound of the error bars represents the 10th and 90th percentile of the 45 data points, respectively. The experimental data and modeling results were normalized by the maximum concentration among the monitoring points for the entire experiment. The comparison in Fig. 12 shows that the trend of the particle concentration variation versus time predicted by the hybrid model agrees with the experimental data.",

The rest of the particles dispersed to other locations and also led to peaks but with lower concentrations. The hybrid model over-predicted the concentrations at 1D, 3B, and 3C and somewhat under-predicted at 1C. We suspected that the discrepancies were mainly attributed to the differences between the modeled and measured airflow fields, as shown in Fig. 13 . Observing the experimental data, very limited portion of particles moved backward, which indicated that the general direction of the airflow above 2C was pointing forward. However, the modeled airflow showed the existence of both the forward and backward directions. Therefore, the modeling results showed that a considerable portion of particles moved backward so that the concentrations at 3B and 3C increased. The airflow distribution in aircraft cabins is extremely complicated and difficult to model accurately [16, 27, 28] . Nevertheless, the hybrid model can predict the transient particle concentration distribution for engineering applications.",

In addition, the hybrid model can significantly reduce the computing cost in two aspects. First, the traditional approach for obtaining the time-dependent flow distribution using the DES model is Approach_2b or Approach_3. However, the hybrid model uses Approach_2a, which can save about 75% of the computing time compared with Appraoch_2b or Approach_3. Secondly, Wang et al. [18] recommended using the DES-Lagrangian model for transient particle transport simulations. The hybrid model uses the DES-Lagrangian model in the first few seconds of the flow time and the RANS-Eulerian model afterward. The RANS-Eulerian model can save about 84% of the computing time compared with the DES-Lagrangian model [18] . The ratio of the computing time by the hybrid model to the DES-Lagrangian model is:",

Taking the first-class cabin of the MD-82 aircraft as an example, the t DES\u00c0Lagrangian and t RANS\u00c0Eulerian were 22.3 and 477.7 s, respectively. Then T hybrid /T DES\u00c0Lagrangian was only 20%; that is, the hybrid model can save about 80% of the computing time compared with the DES-Lagrangian model. Therefore, the proposed hybrid model can significantly reduce the computing costs. It should be noticed that a person who is very ill with a respiratory infection tends to cough more than just once. To take this factor into account, the super-imposition method proposed by Gupta et al. [29] can be used together with our experimental or modeling data to estimate the effect of multiple coughs. Furthermore, a lot of people attempt to cover their mouth with their hand or a tissue when they cough. However, a model for predicting exhaled particle transport by coughs with covering the mouth with a hand or tissue is not available, which deserves further investigations. Our study simulated a scenario when a coughing passenger who was at sleep so he/she could not cover the mouth when coughing.",
