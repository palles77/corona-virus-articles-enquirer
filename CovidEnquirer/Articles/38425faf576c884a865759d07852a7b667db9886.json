From this Act the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW) was created. In turn, OLAW developed the requirement for an Assurance Statement to be filed by each organization receiving PHS funds. The Assurance Statement requires the presence of a management program for all vertebrate species. The most recent edition of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NRC 1996) is the key reference and standard for establishing an animal care and management program.",

Their purpose is to help safeguard the health of the animals and personnel. As Fig. 12-1 illustrates, a quality control program is the basis of a protective curtain enveloping the animals. Direct health surveillance of the mouse Fig. 12-1 The mouse's response to experimental manipulations is the product of the interaction of its genome with the numerous environmental factors that may or may not be present. Environmental quality control strives to define those factors impinging on the mouse. Management practices ultimately dictate to what the mouse will be exposed. (Modified from Serrano 1971b and Lindsey et al. 1978.) is the subject of Chapter 11 in Volume 3 and is not discussed here. However, it should be clearly understood that no health surveillance program is a disease prevention program. Likewise, environmental and equipment monitoring systems do not control the environment or equipment located within the animal facility, they only define and identify the situation. These systems are incorporated within the facility to monitor, record events, and notify selected individuals of an alarm condition requiring immediate attention. The ability to record temperature, humidity, light levels, ammonia, CO2, and O2 at the animal cage level can provide valuable data for both research and management of the animals.",

This monitoring point may be a public reception area staffed by a member of the animal facility or an entry area controlled by unique electronic identification cards. Electronic key cards have the advantage of being monitored during use and, if lost or stolen, deactivated. Twenty-four hours a day monitoring of all access points with video recording equipment and archiving of activity is desirable. Conventionally keyed locks are frequently used but do not provide a record of who used the key or whose key was used. Standard metal keys are successful only as long as access to keys is controlled. Frequent changes of lock cylinders are time consuming, expensive, and troublesome for staff and users alike. For tracking and accounting purposes, each key should be uniquely identified. Keys should be the kind that make it difficult to obtain duplicates outside of the organization. Stamping each key \"Do Not Duplicate\" may be only a minor deterrent to duplication. Keys must be accounted for and returned when no longer needed or when employment ends. Withholding the final paycheck in the absence of returning all keys should be considered policy. Security against unauthorized intrusion or use of a facility is expensive to implement, entails a degree of inconvenience for users, and requires continuing education. However, lack of security can lead to significant losses in time, research effort, physical assets, and financial resources.

            "text": "HVAC are among the most critical environmental factors in a vivarium. A discussion of environmental factors must differentiate between the room (macro) environment and the cage (micro) environment. The introduction of the isolation cage by Kraft (1958) proved to be effective in protecting mice from infection with the rotavirus causing epidemic diarrhea of infant mice. Subsequently, static microisolation cage systems, as originally developed by Sedlacek et al. (1981) were widely used during the 1970s and 1980s. These systems were instrumental in the development and use of specific pathogen-free rodents in research (Coming and Lipman 1991; Lipman 1992) . The effect of the filter on the cage environment became evident with the reduction of air changes within the cage compared to the room and the buildup of relative humidity, carbon dioxide, and ammonia concentrations (Besch 1975; Broderson et al. 1976; Murakami 1971; Serrano 1971 a; Simmons et al. 1968; Weihe 1965) . With the added labor of changing cages, in some cases twice per week, including sterilizing cages and water bottles and using sterile techniques within a Class 100 workstation, labor cost more than doubled. The need for improved ventilation within these isolation cages as well as the ability to reduce the change interval presented a challenge.",

Preferably, a continuous permanent record should be maintained of the temperature and humidity. Recording thermographs and hydrographs (portable or fixed) in the room may be adequate where a few rooms are involved. However, a better system is to have sensor probes connected to recorders in an accessible area out of the room. This allows the rooms to be monitored 24 h a day without entry by engineering and security personnel. The best system is a centralized monitoring system, which receives data from several areas and which is under continuous surveillance. However, the more complex monitoring equipment is, the more apt it is to fail. Even with a centralized system, an in-room device for measuring temperature and humidity is often appreciated by the animal care staff and serves as a check on and back up to the central system. Failure of air handling equipment may result in severe stress or even death of animals. Without a record of room temperature and humidity, the cause may never be ascertained if it is related to environmental changes. Direction of air flow, usually room to return (dirty) corridor, can be checked using a smoke pencil with the door opened slightly. In facilities where containment or exclusion of airborne microorganisms depends in part on differentials in air pressure, consideration should be given to installing an inclined manometer for each room. This measures the difference between the high and low pressure areas in inches of water. Generally, 0.1-0.2 in. (2.5-5.0 mm) differential is maintained. Also, a simple mechanical device indicating positive or negative pressure uses a colored ball in a clear tube that penetrates the room wall and can be read from the corridor outside the room (Wiseman 2003 ).",

As filters become dirty, they become more efficient at filtering out particulate matter; however, the volume of air passing through the filter per unit of time decreases. This decrease is expected and, within limits established by the fan manufacturer and the facility engineer, does not present problems. Failure to change or clean filters as required will result in reduced air flow to the animal room, possible imbalance in the air system, and wasted energy. Where HEPA filters are used, prefilters are routinely installed. They should be serviced as needed to prolong the life of the costly HEPA filters. If exhaust air is filtered through HEPA filters to prevent pathogenic microorganisms or particulate toxic substances from entering the environment, the filters must be serviced (installed and removed) by someone trained in handling biohazards.",

            "text": "The probability of first identifying a pathogen in an animal room by monitoring the air is remote; however, quantitative monitoring under specific conditions may prove useful in identifying microorganisms contaminating barrier colonies. Environmental air sampling has been recently reviewed, (CDC 2003) . Microbiologic sampling of air should be part of an epidemiologic investigation or assessment of hazardous environmental conditions to detect contamination or verify abatement of a hazard. Random and undirected microbiologic sampling of air is not warranted. It is important that the level of activity and other conditions in the room be constant between and during sampling periods, otherwise counts will have little meaning. High-volume air sampling can be useful in epidemiologic studies. For example, McGarrity and Dion (1978) recovered polyoma virus from the air of a mouse room while cages were being changed. Usually, monitoring of air for its microbial content is done by one of three methods: (1) settling plates (Petri dishes) exposed to the air for a stated period of time, usually 1 h; (2), high-volume air impact samplers, that is, Andersen Cascaded Sieve Sampler (Andersen Samplers, Inc., Smyrna, GA); and (3) liquid impingers. Settle plates are inexpensive and can give a qualitative picture of the organisms (bacteria and fungi) present if they grow on the culture media used. Do not use settle plates to quantify the concentration of airborne fungal spores (Streifel referenced in CDC 2003) . Methods 2 and 3 will also allow for recovery of some viruses, provide quantitative answers and have the advantage of sampiing, a large volume of air; however, the equipment is more expensive and requires more training to use it properly. The routine monitoring of air for its microbial content should not be part of a quality control program. Examining the animals will undoubtedly provide more useful information.",

Frequency is designated in hertz (Hz) and intensity in decibels (dB). Both humans and animals are more directly responsive to increases in the intensity of a sound than they are to changes in frequency. Humans are most aware of sounds in the 20-20,000 Hz (0.02-20 kHz) range (Turner et al. 2005) . Peak response in mice is between 10 and 20 kHz with hearing responses recorded up to 110 kHz (reviewed by Brown and Pye 1975) . Ultrasound production by mice is recognized with the range of sound extending from 33 to 140 kHz (Sewell 1967) . Holy and Guo (2005) reported ultrasonic vocalizations (30-110 kHz) of a rapid series of chirp-like syllables by B6D2F1 male mice presented urine of either sex of BALB/c mice.

This is especially true in multispecies facilities and in large single-species facilities using considerable amounts of mechanical equipment. Recognized problems with high noise levels usually stem from complaints by people working in the area or from inspections by health safety officers. Physiologic effects of noise on the mice are rarely considered (Pfaff 1974). However, considerable data exist pointing to adverse biologic effects of noise on rodents (Anthony 1963; Gamble 1982; Iturrian and Fink 1968; Kimmel et al. 1976; Seyfried 1979 Seyfried , 1982 Welch and Welch 1970; Zakem and Alliston 1974) . Fletcher (1976) and Peterson (1980) reviewed the effects of noise on laboratory animals. Physiologic effects of noise are considered to be primarily mediated through the anterior pituitary acting on the adrenal gland, and the effects observed are those associated with increased levels of corticosteroids and epinephrine (Anthony 1955; Ackerman 1955, 1957; Anthony et al. 1959) . Eosinopenia occurs but is transitory unless noise exposure is prolonged. Also, the degree of eosinopenia is greater in audiogenic seizure-prone mice. There was a transitory hypertrophy of the fasiculate zone of the cortex of the adrenal glands 5-8 h following exposure to sound. These studies were done at a sound-pressure level of approximately 110 dB in a 10-20 kHz band for periods of 15 or 45 minutes a day over a 30-day period. Busnel and Molin (1978) studied the effects of noise coupled with mechanical development. Their studies utilized a recording of Paris subway sounds at a level of 105 _+ 5 dB, which was not noxious for the auditory organs and an oscillating shaker for 4 and 2 h a day, respectively. Increased numbers of resorptions and birth defects and low birth weight were found in sound and vibration exposed groups of heating mice. Unfortunately, a vibration-only control group was not included in the study. Miline and Kochak (1951) , studying rabbits and guinea pigs, felt that mechanical vibration exerted more of a stress than noise alone (cited in Anthony and Ackerman 1955) . Zoric (1959) reported degenerative changes in the reproductive organs of male mice repeatedly exposed to the noise of an electric bell for 8 h each day. Interference with normal fetal development has been reported following exposure of pregnant mice to excessive noise (Ward et al. 1970 ).",

Movement of cages, racks, and mechanical vehicles provide additional sources of noise. Coupled with this high noise level may be mechanical vibrations that are transmitted to animal rooms. Horns, buzzers, and alarm bells serve as sources of intense noise. Consideration should be given to the use of silent alarms where possible.

Seizures associated with fur clipping, tail tattooing, and fire alarms in FVB mice or mice with an FVB background has been reported. Neuronal necrosis was reported in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus (Goelz et al. 1998) . The use of radios in animal rooms is a common practice, and the sound level as well as the frequency distribution varies considerably. The effect of high-frequency sound from electronic medical devices, radios, and television sets on animals remains to be fully elucidated (Pfaff and Stecker 1976; Turner et al. 2005) . The sound and vibration of air-conditioning equipment may be transmitted through ducts to animal rooms and provide an increased sound level. Canines and primates generate significant noise levels, especially while people are in the room. Housing these species distant from mice is highly desirable, not only for reasons of noise but to prevent transmission of disease, that is, salmonellosis, to the mice.",

As a precaution, it is recommended that areas housing mice be surveyed every few years, or when a significant change in the physical or mechanical structure is made, to determine that noise levels above 4 kHz are less than 70 dB SPL.

Ament (1971) has described three types of cage washers: (1) each phase of the cycle uses fresh water, (2) water from the final rinse is used for the next cycle's prewash, and (3) wash solution is recirculated. Although reusing the detergent containing wash solution saves hot water, detergent, and energy, it is seldom done in rack or cabinet washers today due to the possibility of contaminating the next load. It is standard practice in most situations to save the final rinse and use it for the prewash phase of the next cycle, especially if several cycles are being run consecutively. The objective of washing should be to render the cages and associated equipment (1) physically clean and (2) free of potentially harmful substances including viable vegetative bacteria, carcinogens, and radioactive substances. Even with a properly operating modem cage washer, soil removal may be incomplete. Sansone and Fox (1977) and Fox and Helfrich-Smith (1980) , using sodium fluorescein to simulate a carcinogen, demonstrated the deposition of nanogram quantities of fluorescein on \"washed\" cages when the final rinse from the previous load was used for the prewash cycle in the following load. When dealing with cages exposed to toxic substances, testing washing performance, for example, trace residues, is warranted. In tunnel washers the detergent solutions are used for extended periods and often changed only daily or less often. Detergent solutions become loaded with debris from the cages and redeposit it on the cages. All debris may not be removed in J.",

These studies utilizing Mycobacterium phlei, an organism more heat resistant than M. tuberculosis, determined the minimum water temperature requirements which will produce, with an adequate margin of safety and the most economy, the required cumulative heat factor for sanitization in a commercial multiple tank, conveyor spray-type dishwashing machine meeting the minimum mechanical operating requirements of NSF Standard No. 3 (NSF 1977) . Critical to this work is the use of the concept of cumulative heat factor (CHF) originally developed by Fuchs (1951) . The work of Fuchs in establishing the concept of CHF was reviewed in the first edition (Small 1983 ) and subsequently by Wardrip et al. (1994) . Wardrip et al. (2000) also verified the bacterial killing effects of the wash time versus wash temperatures. When evaluating dishwashers, the temperature used to develop the CHF is that measured at the dish (or cage) surface. Thermal death of organisms is primarily due to the effects of the temperature transmitted from the water impinging on them rather than from the temperature effects transmitted from the object being washed. The CHF is based on the 30 minutes (1800 sec) at 62~ (143~ required for pasteurization of milk, which, in turn, is based on the killing of M. tuberculosis. In the case of M. phlei the 1800 sec required at 62~ (143~ is reduced to 80 seconds at 68~ (154~ and only 15 seconds at 72~ (161 ~ The CHF takes into account the total time an object is subjected to water at temperatures above 62~ This timetemperature relationship is made use of in designing dishwashers and cage washers. In the tunnel washer, initial exposure is to the wash solution at a minimum of 66~ (150~ In most batch cage washers there is a prerinse utilizing the final rinse from the previous cycle prior to its being discarded. This prerinse has the advantage of reducing the soil load in the detergent solution and raising the temperature of the washed items. The relatively low temperature of the detergent (wash) solution precludes \"baking\" proteinaceous waste on the equipment. Also, some detergents specify they are to be used at temperatures between 60 ~ and 71~ (140~176 Detergents may be increasingly corrosive at higher temperatures and they may break down.",

As the water leaves the spray nozzle, it forms droplets, decreases in velocity, and cools. The higher the pressure, the smaller the droplets and, subsequently, increased heat loss. Temperature and velocity decrease as the distance from the nozzle increases; therefore, the geometric configuration of the nozzles and their distance from the object being washed is very important. Because of these factors, measurement of water temperature in the tank or at the nozzle does not accurately reflect the temperature of the water striking a cage surface. The recommended final rinse temperature of 82~ (180~ as measured in the tank takes this temperature drop into account.",

Modem cage washers are equipped to monitor the time and temperature of each portion of the cage wash cycle and print out these data. These data should be constantly reviewed and archived. These real-time monitors and recorders have mostly replaced spot checks for temperature. In the absence of continuous temperature monitoring, spot checks for maximum temperature during one or more cycles daily are warranted. Physical indicators are available which indicate peak temperature during the cycle. However, they do not reflect the CHE A glass tube containing a steel ball held in a wax pellet that melts at 82~ (Zwarum and Weisbroth 1979) is often used. The tube is attached to equipment being washed and examined at the end of the cycle for melting of the wax and dropping of the ball. Heat-sensitive indicator strips designed to turn colors when one or more specific temperatures are reached are also used. Tunnel washers should be constantly monitored for temperature. If wash and rinse temperatures are maintained within acceptable ranges and washed equipment is observed to be physically clean, few if any failures of sanitization will be encountered. However, tunnel washers, because they recirculate the detergent solution which continuously accumulates dirt and waste from the cages, deposit debris laden water on the cages before the rinse cycles. If the rinse cycles are deficient, cages may be free of viable vegetative microbes, but still contaminated with a residue from the debris. Periodic culturing of washed equipment for vegetative bacteria as it exits the cage washer is of value in validating cage washer operation if you can define how it assists management in making decisions. However, with continuous monitoring of the temperature for each cycle in batch washers and continuous monitoring of the temperatures in tunnel washers, the need for culturing washed equipment is greatly reduced. Any of three culture methods can be used (Branson 1972) , the swab method, the swab-rinse technique, or the agar contact plates (RODAC) (Baltimore Biological Laboratory, Becton Dickinson, Inc.) described by Hall and Hartnett (1964) .",

Mineral content of the water, soil load, equipment to be cleaned, and the detergent dispensing system are factors to be considered. Detergent concentration is monitored by a conductivity cell that determines electrical resistance based on a certain concentration in a given water sample. The desired conductivity will vary with the product. In most cases in which a recirculating wash solution is used, an automatic dispenser with an in-line conductivity cell is used. Automatic dispensers may also be used on batch washers. As the detergent solution is diluted by the addition of fresh water, the resistance increases, activating a valve causing the release of additional detergent. When the ionic strength of the wash solution reaches the level preset in the dispenser, the valve closes. For this system to operate properly the conductivity probe in the wash tank must be protected from physical damage and he kept free of mineral deposits. Depending on the amount of use, weekly inspection with periodic cleaning in a descaling solution is suggested. Many detergent manufacturers will furnish equipment to measure detergent concentration. Also, most companies will periodically inspect and service without charge the dispensing equipment they install. This service does not relieve the facilities manager from the responsibility for understanding the equipment and monitoring its operation. Although most manufacturers aim for a 0.2-0.25% use-dilution of detergent, this can vary with the quality of water available. In addition to added cost, excess detergent may damage equipment or result in detergent residues. Determination of the minimal concentration of detergent required will be a matter of trial and error. The main considerations are complete cleaning without damage to the cage and absence of detergent residue following the final rinse. Using detergents formulated for the material being washed is extremely important. Each container of detergent should be verified by its label that it is the intended product. Personnel responsible for operating the cage wash equipment should be trained to recognize the physical nature of approved detergent containers, presence of seals on outlets, and the colors of the products if distinctive. The accidental washing of mouse cages made of high temperature polycarbonate in a solution of a quaternary ammonium disinfectant resulted in severe damage to the cages and leaching of bisphenol A from the plastic. Bisphenol A has estrogenic activity. (Howdeshell et al. 2003; Hunt et al. 2003; Koehler et al. 2003) . Also, see Lipman, Chapter 9, this volume.",

McPherson (1963) used the equivalent of 6.0 ml of 1.0 N HCI (8.5%) per liter of tap water. The pH was maintained over a 7-day period, at which time the water bottles were changed. However, water supplies vary considerably and each user should determine the exact amount of acid required to obtain the desired pH. The pH should be checked with a calibrated pH meter as pH test papers are unreliable in solutions of low ionic strength. If an in-line acidifying system is used, a pH meter should be incorporated and connected to an alarm system in case the pH falls outside the acceptable range. If the alarm is located in the animal area, it is better to use a flashing light than a bell as an indicator of failure. It needs to be recognized that hydrochloric acid-treated water will not eliminate P. aeruginosa from infected mice nor necessarily prevent transfer of organisms from infected to noninfected cagemates by the fecal oral route. However, the elimination of the spread of P. aeruginosa and other bacteria through the water can be expected.",

            "text": "b. CHLORINATION The hyperchlorination (8-20 ppm) of rodent drinking water to control P. aeruginosa and other gramnegative microorganisms has been practiced for many years (Beck 1963; Homberger 1993; McDougal et al. 1967; McPherson 1963; Woodward 1963) . The antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) is most active in an approximate pH range of 5-6.5 (slightly acid). The addition of hydrochloric acid or other acids to lower the pH of hyperchlorinated drinking water to approximately 2.8 cannot be recommended. Concentrations of free chlorine in water decrease from outgassing or combining with organic matter in the water. McPherson (1963) recorded drops in free chlorine from 12 ppm to 0.25 ppm in water bottles after 72 h, with bacterial contamination nearly equal that of tap water without the addition of chlorine. In contrast, Homberger et al. (1993) demonstrated a decline in free chlorine from 6 ppm to 2 ppm in water bottles over a 1-week period. A possible reason for this difference may have been the number of mice per cage and their microbial burden. McPherson's study, done in the early 1960s, used round glass jars as mouse breeding cages in a production colony, whereas Homberger et al. used polycarbonate cages holding only two mice each with well-defined microbial burdens. Either chlorine gas or sodium hypochlorite may be used as a source of chlorine. Chlorine is a highly toxic and reactive element in the free state and extreme caution must be exercised when handling it. If using sodium hypochlorite as a source of chlorine, dilute concentrated solutions in clean containers. Unless the chlorine content is determined by the user, only stock solutions less than 6 months old and stored below 21~ should be used. Household bleach containing 5.25% sodium hypochlorite, diluted 1 ml per gallon of tap water gives approximately 13-14 ppm free chlorine. When purchasing sodium hypochlorite solutions, especially as household bleach, check the label for percentage of sodium hypochlorite and the absence of any other chemicals such as fragrances, detergents, or cleaning \"enhancers.\" It is best to verify with the manufacturer the suitability of the specific product for your intended use.",

Many bottles today are made of plastic, usually polycarbonate or polysulfone. The problems of glass bottles with their weight and attendant dangers of cuts from glass plus the aggravation and lost time make plastic an excellent choice. However, caution must be exercised in washing plastic (see section on cage washing) and interaction between the plastic and any test substance added to the drinking water must be understood. The sipper tube is probably the most difficult piece of portable animal care equipment to clean. Stoppers and sipper tubes need to be examined for cleanliness and condition. Microorganisms form a biofilm on the inner wall of sipper tubes and on the stopper that is difficult to remove by conventional washing techniques. Often, sipper tubes and stoppers are soaked or agitated in a detergent solution or a detergent solution containing chlorine. Failure to rinse the solution from the tube lumen can result in highly alkaline \"soapy\" water when next used. This can result in dehydration and even chemical irritation or bums in the mice. The presence of foam in freshly filled bottles should alert one to the possibility of detergent residue (See section on Cage Washing for test methods). Sipper tubes and stoppers can be sterilized in the autoclave. Autoclaving, however, does not physically clean the tubes and stoppers. Further, centrally generated steam frequently contains one or more corrosion inhibiting chemicals that may affect the mice. As an alternative to sipper tubes, bottles are available with a hole drilled through the neck. The mice lick the water through the hole.",

If desired, this processed water may be also be acidified. The continuous flow and exposure of the water to high intensity ultraviolet light inactivates bacteria and viruses and aids in blocking the development of a biofilm (Wallbank and Lebtag 1985) . A second approach for distribution of water to rack manifolds is a flush system that provides daily flushing of the room distribution and the attached racks to the drain controlled by a microprocessor unit that communicates with the pressure control stations. This design incorporates reverse osmosis filtration with chlorination or acidification. Multiple pressure regulating stations are present and electrically operated valves are used to increase pressure during the manifold flush cycle. Water is discharged to a sink/drain. Following the flush period of a few minutes, pressure reverts to 3 to 5 psi. These systems may have on-line rack flush controlled by a rack mounted electrical valve. This allows for daily flushing of the manifold while the distribution system is being flushed. The size of the flush system RO unit supply must be determined based on the large volumes of water that will be flushed to the drain daily and the cost of the RO water. Sanitizing this system requires filling and flushing the pipes, tubing, valves, and manifolds with a biocide, usually sodium hypochlorite at 20-50 ppm for 30-60 minutes. Both approaches use devices to monitor and record the daily operation of the equipment.",

Its role is not to provide bacteria-free water. In fact, filters frequently serve as a nidus for large numbers of microorganisms, and they should be examined at regular intervals and replaced as required.

A fan circulates air through a coarse (roughing) filter followed by a HEPA filter that is rated to retain 99.97% of particles 0.3 ~m or larger. Critical to the effective use of HEPAfiltered air is the maintenance of the filters. On receipt from the manufacturer, equipment needs to be checked for leaks through and around the filters. Certification of the integrity of HEPA filters is quite involved and is usually done by members of an organization's safety group. Once a portable unit is certified, movement of the unit from area to area should be avoided as integrity of the filters may be disturbed. As the filters accumulate dirt, the velocity of the air coming from the filter (face velocity) will drop. Frequent replacement or cleaning of the roughing filters will greatly prolong the life of HEPA filters and the blower motor. Many units have gauges indicating the face velocity and a control to regulate the blower motor speed. The face velocity should be adjusted to meet the recommendations of the manufacturer. For most applications, a face velocity of between 50 and 90 ft/min is maintained.",

The pressure of the liquid in its container and the pressure within the autoclave chamber must be slowly equalized with the room pressure prior to opening the chamber door.

Most autoclaves in use today have a liquid cycle, which automatically and slowly reduces pressure within the chamber; however, caution should be observed when opening the door.

Each sterilizer should be operated according to the manufacturer's instructions. The highest temperature that is reached during sterilization and the length of time that this temperature was maintained should be recorded and checked for adequacy; this check is the most important means of ensuring sterility. Checks of steam sterilization performance should be carried out at least weekly. A recently developed rapid readout biologic indicator (B I) for measuring the success of steam sterilizer cycles has been described and is commercially available. It is based on the fluorescent detection of a Geobacillus (Bacillus) stearothermophilus (an organism whose spores are particularly heat resistant, thus ensuring a wide margin of safety) sporeassociated enzyme and provides results within 3 h compared to 24-48 h for conventional BI tests using the same organism (McCormick et al. 2003 , Schneider 2004 Vesley et al. 1995) .

Placement of thermocouples or wireless data loggers measuring temperature and pressure in the center of the load followed by culture of samples for thermophilic anaerobes is recommended. Data loggers are small self-contained microelectronic devices capable of repeatedly recording temperature, humidity, or pressure or a combination of these parameters during the sterilization cycle. On completion of the cycle, the data logger(s) are connected to a computer and the data are transferred for analysis. Data loggers are less cumbersome, more reliable, and less time consuming to use than thermocouples. Also, data loggers can be easily used in autoclaves not equipped with a gland, which is usually required for the use of thermocouples (www.mesalabs.com/datatrace/pdfs/Validationf orISO17025Poster.pdf). Use of thermocouples or data loggers with food has the added advantage of monitoring the load for excessive temperature, which may result in subsequent loss of nutrient activity. The use of chemical-based steam sterilization indicators may give an erroneous sense of security and should J. DAVID SMALL AND RICK DEITRICH not be relied on to check the efficacy of steam autoclaves (Lee et al. 1979) . Ethylene oxide (EtO) is widely used in specially designed autoclaves or chambers to sterilize heat-and moisturesensitive instruments and materials. Compared to steam sterilization, it is a more complex, lengthy, and expensive process. EtO finds few uses in animal facilities outside of sterilizing heat-sensitive instruments and items for surgical implantation. EtO is highly flammable and explosive when mixed with air. Prior to December 1995 EO for sterilization was mixed with a chloroflurocarbon. From 1996 onward the FDA has approved the use of 100% EtO and EtO stabilized with carbon dioxide or hydrochlorofluorocarbon (Rutala and Weber 2001) . Before sterilization, objects need to be cleaned and wrapped. EtO sterilizing chambers of various sizes are available that use 100% EtO in single-use containers. A negative aspect of using EtO is the long exposure time required for sterilization followed by a period of \"degassing\" or exposure to room air. Chemically sensitive indicators should be used with each package to show that it has been exposed to the gas sterilization process. Gas sterilizers should be checked with commercial preparations of spores of Bacillus subtilis (an EtO resistant spore). If an EtO sterilizer is used infrequently, it should be checked with each load. Use of EtO is highly regulated by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Time weighted average (TWA) exposures for an 8-h workday and for 15 minutes are 1 ppm and 5 ppm, respectively. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers EtO to be a probable human carcinogen and has ranked it in EPA's Group B 1. Exposure of personnel to EtO must be monitored and records retained for 30 years (ATSDR 2003; CFR 29: Part 1926 .1147 EPA (2006) Air Toxics Website-EtO). Due to its toxicity, all exhaust from EtO sterilizers and aerators for EtO sterilization must be safely vented. All items processed by EtO sterilization need special aeration according to manufacturer's recommendations to remove toxic residues of gas.",

Others ship to distributors who store the products in their own warehouse or facility prior to delivering them to the end user. Factors such as shipment by a manufacturer's dedicated truck versus a commercial common carrier needs to be considered. A second concern is the condition of the dealer's storage facility. When possible, inspection of dealer's facilities on a regular, but unannounced, basis is suggested. The dealer should have a quality control program in place that includes good record keeping, a professionally supervised pest management program, and monitoring of temperature and humidity.

The use of insecticides in a feed storage area cannot be recommended as they may contaminate the feed. Instead, the use of glue boards and sticky traps (for monitoring purposes) coupled with a high level of sanitation with frequent cleaning and inspection is recommended. Although it is ideal to store feed at 15~ or less, this usually is not possible except for small quantities of experimental diets. However, care should be taken that the temperature in feed storage areas does not exceed 21~ (NRC 1996) .

The natural ingredient diet remained satisfactory under all storage conditions, including a sample stored at temperatures varying between 23 ~ and 30~ The semipurified diet showed significant deterioration at 20~ but not at 4~ or below. These limited studies suggest that natural ingredient diets may be stored for longer periods at room temperature than has been previously thought. In a limited study Oller et al. (1985) found no changes in mice receiving an autoclaved diet stored for 130 days. Autoclaved diets often become too hard for mice to chew. Thigpen et al.

Uncoded (open dating) is now generally used. If you purchase feed or bedding from a manufacturer who uses a code, ask for the information necessary to read the code.

            "text": "Depending on the type and quality of bedding purchased, the microbiologic status can vary considerably. Most reputable manufacturers of bedding today are able to supply data describing the general microbial content and chemical profile of their beddings. Many bedding products are natural plant materials, processed into a particular size and form. Unless they are protected from contamination, heat treated or steam sterilized, and properly bagged, they are may contain high counts of microorganisms. These microbes are not necessarily pathogens. An outbreak of murine leptospirosis was associated with the use of unprocessed soft wood sawdust, which most likely became contaminated by wild mice (Stoenner et al. 1958) . In another case, unheated wood chip bedding contaminated with Aspergillus fumigatus altered the immune response of mice exposed to the bedding and was associated with the widespread contamination of several vivarium facilities (Mayeux et al. 1995) . Unless it is known to be free of pathogens, bedding is best stored separate from feed. Different bedding products have various levels of dust content generated during the manufacturing process. Dust can be a problem for both the mice and the people who must work with the bedding. Bedding dust is especially a problem for athymic mice which are prone to developing conjunctivitis due to dust. Thigpen et al. (1989) developed a standard method for measuring the size of bedding particles and the dust content. Bedding storage areas should receive the same considerations as feed storage areas except that the temperature need not be as tightly controlled. It is helpful if the nature of the source(s) and processing of the bedding used is understood. Consultation with suppliers is helpful. Kraft (1980) reviewed rodent bedding materials.",

To meet this goal, a high level of surface disinfection is used to maintain the animal rooms, cages, and equipment associated with changing cages. The concern is that any item or surface contacting the mouse or its cage may serve as a source of adventitious microorganisms. The use of highlevel disinfectants for routine disinfection of environmental surfaces in the mouse room runs counter to the Guidelines (CDC 2003) . However, this use is done with the understanding that mice may become exposed to adventitious microorganisms present on environmental surfaces when outside their cage. This exposure becomes even more of a threat if the mice involved have a compromised immune system. Modem vivariums for mice are often operated on a basis of zero tolerance for the presence many infectious agents.",

            "text": "Selection of the class of disinfectant-detergent agent should be the result of professional judgment. The guidelines for routine cleaning and disinfection of floors and other smooth hard surfaces are as follows: Select EPA registered disinfectants, and use them in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (CDC 2003) . All EPA registered disinfectants are assigned a registration number and have passed basic tests to support claims for efficacy against specific organisms. In-house testing of disinfectants using the various official tests is not recommended (Mallison 1977) . A difference between disinfectantdetergents for the human health care environment and the vivarium environment is that items for use in research animal facilities should not contain perfumes and odiferous essential oils that can affect an animal's metabolism. Regardless of the disinfectant-detergent selected, \"elbow grease\" is an important ingredient in controlling microbial contamination. Cleaning must always precede high-level disinfection and sterilization (Rutala and Weber 2004b) . Although this statement was made with regard to medical devices, it also applies to many environmental surfaces in a mouse vivarium housing disease-free mice with a limited microbial flora. A product compatible with local tap water, not overwhelmed by organic soil, and used properly should give good results (Mallison 1975) . Ability to clean is not assessed by the EPA tests; however, adequate detergency should be a major factor in selecting registered disinfectantdetergents. A physically clean surface is a critical aspect of ensuring decontamination. It may be necessary to preclean a severely soiled surface with a heavy duty detergent prior to use of a disinfectant-detergent. When surfaces are known to be contaminated with pathogens, inactivation of pathogens may take precedence over cleaning. It may be necessary to repeat the decontamination process followed by additional cleaning.",

Each has advantages and disadvantages. Solutions of all three of these disinfectants, under some conditions, are permissive to the survival or growth of gram-negative bacteria (Rutala and Cole 1984) . The substituted phenols exhibit activity against most vegetative forms of bacteria (including Mycobacterium spp.), fungi, and some viruses. They maintain this activity in the presence of moderate soil loads and can be formulated to have excellent detergency. Disadvantages are their toxic nature and the resistance of certain phenolics to biodegradation (Voets et al. 1976) . Skin contact should be avoided as phenolics may depigment skin (Kahn 1970) . Mixed with other chemicals, they may form toxic lethal compounds (Lynch et al. 1975) . A laboratory study has suggested that the rotation of phenolic disinfectantsmone alkaline, one acidmimproved efficacy over time against P. aeruginosa adherent to stainless steel (Conner and Eckman 1993) . This observation may have been influenced by the number of organisms present in the test situation. Under field conditions, emergence of microbial populations resistant to disinfectants does not appear to be a problem. Rotation of disinfectants to prevent selection for resistance is not necessary provided environmental monitoring data show a consistent microbial profile (Kopis 2001) . However, in the pharmaceutical industry at least, rotation of disinfectants used in aseptic processing areas is almost universally practiced (Denny and Marslk 1997) . In a study comparing hospital isolates of antibiotic resistant bacteria to stock cultures of sensitive bacteria only in 1 of 20 comparative trials did antibiotic resistant bacteria exhibit increased resistance to a disinfectant. The authors concluded that the development of antibiotic resistance does not appear to correlate with increased resistance to disinfectants . The question of germicide use and development of bacterial resistance or tolerance to germicides and antibiotics has been reviewed (Favero 2004; Russell 2004) .",

It is reasonable to request that feed and bedding dealers inform you about their pest management program and make available pest management reports pertaining to their facilities. Periodic visits of these dealers with a walk through inspection of their facilities should be a condition of doing business with them. Movement of wild rodents, other mammals, birds, and insects into an animal facility is a constant threat to the health of the experimental animals (as well as to the health of the staff). The level of infestation with pests is an excellent index of the overall management and sanitation of an animal facility.",

A thorough understanding of the biology of the pests likely to be encountered is essential to preventing them from gaining entrance. Knowledge of pesticides and their effects on animals and humans is critical; otherwise, efforts may be wasted, experiments jeopardized, and people endangered by the incorrect selection and application of chemicals. Senior management must be responsible for approving all use of pesticides within and around the vivarium. Many publications are available that provide information on pests and their control (Ebling 1978; Grad 1980; Mallis 2004 ). In addition, anyone with responsibility for the use of pesticides needs to be familiar with applicable federal and state laws. The EPA regulates the use of pesticides under the authority of two federal statues: the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) (www.epa.gov/pesticides/regulating/laws.htm) (EPA 2006) . FIFRA provides the basis for the regulation, sale, distribution, and use of pesticides in the United States. It also authorizes EPA to review and register pesticides for specific uses. The FFDCA authorizes EPA to set maximum residue levels, or tolerances, for pesticides used in or on foods or animal feed (Diederich 2004) .",

If the facility or institution is large enough, perhaps a full-time pest management professional can be supported. Selection of this person must be done with care as he or she will become a member of the vivarium management team and his or her decisions will affect research. Ideally, the person will have experience working with and in research facilities, be knowledgeable about pest management strategies for vivariums, and understand the needs of the vivarium staff and scientists, working with them to accommodate those needs. He or she should also be familiar with current strategies and issues in pest management and be knowledgeable of applicable federal, state, and local laws. As part of the selection process, interviews of prospective candidates with the candidate making a presentation to the vivarium staff on pest control in research facilities should be considered. Management should determine that all required professional licenses, insurance, and bonds are in place and that presented credentials are accurate. Because of the importance proper pest management plays in the operation of a modern vivarium, it may be to the advantage of the vivarium manager if he or she assumes responsibility for the institution's IPM program.",

In modem rodent vivariums the emphasis of an IPM program should be exclusion of pests with zero tolerance for their presence. Management practices should support this position. Facility design should take into account exclusion with a zero tolerance for pests. To this end, it is recommended that budgets for new construction or remodeled space include funds to treat buildings during construction to exclude pests (Tarshis 1964). Total elimination of pests from facilities with established populations is not impossible; however, it is much more difficult and costly than implementing a preventive program during construction.",

            "text": "Monitoring for the presence of pests in animal facilities is important. A surveillance program for escaped laboratory rodents and wild rodents in animal facilities generally makes use of traps in each animal room and in service areas, including the loading docks and cage wash facilities. Traps can be of the common snap type designed to kill or a live trap capable of catching several mice. Also, glue boards and other adhesivebased traps can be used. They have the advantage of being effective in trapping insects as well as rodents. These traps are placed for the purpose of monitoring, not eliminating or controlling, a pest population, should one be present. For humane reasons as well as for monitoring purposes, traps should be examined daily. Packs of gelled water can be added to enclosed live traps to provide a water source. This becomes important when traps cannot be examined every day (Caviness et al. 2004 ). Trapped rodents should form part of the population examined in the vivarium's disease monitoring program. Records of mice caught in animal rooms can be useful indicators of possible disease problems and failures in the physical plant and breaks in the management program. Trapped mice and rats should be handled with the thought that they may be carrying zoonotic diseases. A high percentage of wild rats and mice carry Leptospira spp., and mice may carry lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. In addition, they may also carry a number of other pathogenic bacteria and parasites. By requiring a daily record of mice caught and their coat colors, attention is focused on the problem of cage and room security. Something is wrong if other than albino mice are trapped in a room housing only albino strains. Infestations with rats and mice can be detected by looking for droppings, rub marks, urine, tracks, gnawing marks, nests, and runs and by noticing their odors. Bait stations commonly used outside of and in surrounding buildings need to be monitored for activity. Burrows need to be noted, investigated for activity, depopulated, and sealed (Corrigan 2004; Howard and Marsh 1976; Marsh and Howard 1977; Pratt et al. 1976 ). Amazingly, adult mice can penetrate openings only 10 mm wide (Rowe 1981 ) and, in general, wild mice are very athletic, being able to jump 30.5 cm vertically from a flat surface, jump from a height of 2.5 m without injury, run up rough vertical surfaces, run along wires and ropes, and swim if necessary (Marsh and Howard 1977) .",

Flying insects, usually flies, are also monitored visually. Light traps (LTs) placed indoors near entrances can be useful for both monitoring and controlling flying insects, especially flies (Gilbert 1984; Harris 2006; Kolbe 2004; Lillie and Goddard 1987; Pickens 1989) . LTs make use of blacklight (BL), blacklight blue (BLB), or blacklight green (BLG) fluorescent bulbs in combination with an electrical grid that kills the insect or a sticky panel that traps it. The bulbs produce light in the ultraviolet A (UVA) band, 320-400 nm, with a peak near 365 nm. Most flying insects are phototropic, with their greatest response to light in the UVA band. However, different insects have preferences for specific wavelengths within this band. This allows one to set up a LT with tubes most attractive to the insects of interest. Pickens (1989) showed that combinations of BL and BLB bulbs did not attract more house flies, Musca domestica L., or stable flies, Stomoxys calcitrans L., than were attracted by B L bulbs used alone. BLB bulbs are more effective in attracting insects of the orders Lepidoptera and Coleoptera. BLG bulbs emit UVA and visible green light. This bulb has been shown to attract more flies than a standard B L bulb (Harris 2006) . All UVA emitting bulbs have a limited effective life of about 7000 h. At this point UVA emissions are reduced to 50% or less of original output. Bulbs must be replaced every 10-12 months for the traps to remain effective. It is a good idea to synchronize replacement of the bulbs with the peak of the insect season. Do not use UVB (tanning) or UVC (germicidal) bulbs. They are not effective in attracting insects and can cause injuries.",

In a vivarium, LTs serve useful dual purposes, as monitors and as a means of control; however, they should not be needed in or adjacent to the animal rooms. Flies generally move close to the floor, and LTs are most effective if placed vertically and within 5 feet of the floor (Pickens et al. 1969) . Incorrectly placed, they may attract flies into a facility. LTs should not be seen from outside entrances as they will draw insects into the building. Study of the references and consultation with pest management experts prior to specifying or ordering LTs is recommended. Correct selection and placement are important to derive maximum benefit.

            "text": "Cockroaches frequently enter facilities in feed and packaging material. Corrugated cardboard is a particularly good means for introducing roaches. Sticky traps are frequently used to monitor for cockroaches (Lavendar and Stark 1980) . Control of cockroaches depends on a high level of sanitation, denial of food and harborage, and, where required, selective use of pesticides. The use of nonvolatile blatticides as baits rather than the repeated application of volatile agents reduces the amount of pesticide used. Further, nonvolatile blatticides target specific populations of pests and reduce the chance that mice may be affected (Burden 1980) . Boric acid (Ebeling 1978; Ebeling et al. 1966 Ebeling et al. , 1967 Ebeling et al. , 1968a Ebeling et al. , 1968b Gore and Schal 2004; Slater et al. 1979 ) has been used with considerable success as has silica aerogel (Tarshis 1964). Several insecticides exert a high degree of repellency against the German cockroach, and although there may be considerable initial mortality, surviving roaches will avoid treated areas (Burden 1975; Ebeling 1978; Ebeling et al. 1966) . Boric acid is readily accepted by the German cockroach, and poisoning occurs through both ingestion and by contact. Gore and Schal (2004) and studied the efficacy of borates plus sugar in the laboratory and in hog barns. They recorded a 90% kill of B. germanica in hog barns in 15 days using a 0.5-2.0% aqueous solution of boric acid with any of several different sugars at molar concentrations of 0.05-1.0. Silica aerogel can be repellent; however, if cockroaches cannot escape contact with the dust, it can be highly effective. Placement of silica aerogel in electrical raceways and other dry, closed spaces during and after construction where the substance will not be disturbed has proved effective in eliminating cockroaches.",

These chemicals act like the growth hormones of insects or block development of chitin, the major building block of the cockroach's exoskeleton. The juvenile hormone-like chemicals hydroprene and pyriproxyfen interfere with the cockroach's ability to molt and develop into a sexually mature and normalappearing adult. These analogs of juvenile hormones work slowly by eliminating future generations of cockroaches. Inhibitors of chitin development, represented by the benzoylphenyl urea (BPU) group of chemicals, block development of the cockroach embryo. However, BPUs also affect adults. Used in baits, these chemicals have gained popularity and great acceptance for control of the German cockroach in buildings as people need not come in contact with the product or the cockroaches that feed on it (Barcay 2004) . IGRs are chemicals. Although their use in proximity to research animals appears to be safe, caution needs to be exercised and more research is warranted before they can be recommended for use within animal facilities.",

These flies include the common house fly (M. domestica) and related members of the Family Muscidae as well as members of the families Anthomyidae, Calliphoridae, Drosophilidae, and Sarcophagidae. Flies found in animal facilities should be identified to aid in developing the proper response. Large flies may travel considerable distance and breed some distance from the vivarium. Small species usually breed within the facilities or near by. For help in identifying flies and other insect pests the use of illustrated keys is recommended (CDC 1969) . These keys are out of print, but available from the CDC on a CD (www.cdc.gov/dpdx/HTML/ CDCproducts..htm). Photographs and drawings of flies and other pests are found in Mallis 2004. Spread of disease by flies is based on both experimental studies and on epidemiologic studies of disease (Kolbe 2004 ). More than 100 species of pathogenic microorganisms have been isolated from or associated with flies (Ebeling 1978) . Flies have been shown experimentally to transmit hog cholera virus (Morgan and Miller 1976). Alam and Zurek (2004) isolated Escherichia coli O157:H57 from M. domestica in association with cattle. Zurek et al. (2001) inoculated M. domestica with Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and detected organisms for up to 36 h in the digestive tract.",

Installation of air doors between two interior rooms is recommended (Kolbe 2004) as are LTs (see previous discussion). In both cases, professional assistance is suggested for selection and installation. Depending on the temperature, the house fly completes its life cycle in as few as 6 days (Metcalf quoted in Kolbe 2004) or 8 days (Ebeling 1978) , and most other filth flies have a longer life cycle; therefore, if mouse cages are changed at least weekly and all waste is removed from the room and promptly disposed of, the animal room should not be a source of new flies. Wet mops not washed but left to dry can be a source of small flies. Filth flies lay their eggs in animal feces, garbage, lawn clippings, and rotting food. Therefore, close monitoring of waste removal and disposal by incineration or deep burial becomes essential to a successful fly control program. Migration of flies from nearby areas can be a problem. Although not strong fliers, houseflies can travel 1 or 2 miles and have been known to travel 28 miles (Ebeling 1978; Kolbe 2004) .",

Sticky strips are helpful in reducing the adult fly population in closed areas such as in animal rooms. A newer chemical means of controlling flies is the use of chemosterilants (Jurd et al. 1979) . These methods offer the advantage of not coming in contact with the experimental animals; however, their effectiveness drops if flies are migrating into the area in large numbers. Space spraying, with its attendant problems of animal exposure to chemicals (and possibly people) is still used but rarely.",

The errors will arise not from the animals or the equipment but from the people who are responsible for developing a management policy and style that maintains the health of the animals and the integrity of the physical plant, yet at the same time makes it a pleasant and functional place for both mice and people to accomplish their intended tasks.",
