Several studies of this phenomenon suggest that learning occurs as a result of modification of neural processes at the primary visual cortex in adults. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] The human visual system consists of a highly sophisticated optical processing system that begins when the cornea and lens conduct an optical image onto the retina and leads to a hierarchy of progressive levels of visual processing, starting from light detection and transduction in the eye by photoreceptors through several stages of spatial integration. Each stage forms receptive fields of increasing complexity.",

            "text": "Contrast is one of the most important parameters activating cortical cells involved in vision processing. 6 Responses of individual neurons to repeated presentations of the same stimulus are highly variable, with signal and noise levels imposing a fundamental limit on the reliable detection and discrimination of visual signals by individual cortical neurons. [7] [8] [9] [10] Neural interactions determine the sensitivity for contrast at each spatial frequency, and the combination of neural activities make up an individual's contrast sensitivity function (CSF). 11 The relationship between neuronal responses and perception are mainly determined by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the neuronal activity, and the brain pools responses across many neurons to average out noisy activity of single cells, improving SNR and leading to significantly improved visual performance. 12 Several studies show that the noise of individual cortical neurons can be modulated by appropriate choice of stimulus conditions. 13, 14 Polat et al. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] showed that contrast sensitivity at low levels can be increased through control of stimulus parameters. The typical building block of these visual stimulations is the Gabor patch (Figure 1 ), which efficiently activates and matches the shape of the receptive field in the visual cortex. Polat et al. 13 found that contrast sensitivity in adult human subjects at low levels can be increased by a factor of 2 through specific control of the Gabor patch parameters. This stimulation-control technique is called lateral masking, in which collinearly oriented flanking Gabors are displayed in addition to the target Gabor image. When subjects are practicing contrast modulation under a very precise and subject-specific stimuli regimen, a significant improvement in contrast sensitivity is achieved. It is these neural modifications that are the basis of brain plasticity, which relates to the ability of the nervous system to adapt to changed conditions, sometimes after injury or stroke, but more commonly in acquiring new skills. 1 Brain plasticity has been shown in many basic tasks, 18 with evidence pointing to physical modifications in the adult cortex during repetitive performance. 1 Several studies show that the plasticity of neural interactions resulting from repetitive performance of specific visual tasks lead to improved visual performance, with retention up to 3 years of retesting. An increased range of neuronal excitatory interactions and reduced inhibition 19 were observed in subjects with normal vision and in monkeys. These studies 4, 14 pointed to activity-dependent plasticity of the visual cortex, where the specific connections activated throughout repetitive performance are modified, leading to improved performance, thus underpinning the concept of perceptual learning.",

The NeuroVision (NVC) correction technology probes specific neuronal interactions, using a set of patient-specific stimuli that improve neuronal efficiency and induce improvement of CSF due to a reduction in noise and increase in signal strength, resulting in improved spatial resolution or visual acuity. Initially developed for the treatment of adult amblyopia, NVC has been shown to be effective in inducing a sustained improvement in CSF and visual acuity in patients who were part of a prospective randomized clinical trial of adult unilateral amblyopia. 20 In this U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) monitored prospective masked controlled study (FDA 510(K) approval given in August 2001), 54 adult amblyopic patients (mean age 35 years) were randomized to amblyopic NVC treatment or a placebo vision-training program. Pretreatment visual acuity in both study arms was 0.42 logMAR, and this improved by 2.5 lines to 20/30 in the NVC treatment group, with no improvement in the control group. This increase in acuity was corroborated by a commensurate increase in CSF to within the normal range. These improvements in acuity and CSF were sustained after 12 months.",

The reduction in CSF, pronounced at high spatial frequencies, is believed to result from a low SNR. A low SNR limits performance on letter identification. 23 Generally, it is known that CSF (especially at higher spatial frequencies) is closely related to resolution (visual acuity). Patients with amblyopia also have abnormal neural interactions, 21 reduced excitation, and increased inhibition, an effect that underlies deficient contrast response. Finally, there is mounting evidence that neural plasticity persists in adult amblyopia 22, [24] [25] [26] [27] as in several studies of visual improvement in adult amblyopia in which visual loss in the good eye resulted in improved vision in the amblyopic eye. This challenges the current dogma that adult amblyopia is irreversible and untreatable.",

In simple myopia, in which a ''front-end'' optical defect in emmetropization develops after the critical period, there is often a mismatch between the optical defect and the neural connections formed during early childhood. The neuronal connectivity has developed normally and is capable of processing images efficiently; however, the visual input is subnormal and limited by optical defocus. The visibility of high spatial frequencies is perceived as low contrast even when their physical contrast is high. Thus, CSF is reduced at the high spatial frequencies, resembling the amblyopic CSF, which, as a consequence, degrades visual acuity. In particular, reduced signal strength is expected to degrade letter identification, as demonstrated by Solomon and Pelli's study. 23 In this study, the level of noise was systematically increased; this was followed by a parallel degradation in letter recognition. Activation of neurons in the visual cortex is directly related to signal strength (contrast); when the effective contrast is low, neurons are weakly activated. Thus, the SNR is low, which limits performance on letter identification (visual acuity), as indicated in the previously mentioned study.",

They are widely used in visual neurosciences and have been shown to efficiently describe the shape of receptive fields of neurons in the primary visual cortex. In all experiments, the standard deviation of the Gabor is maintained equal to the wavelength (s Z l). A Philips multiscan 107P color monitor was used to project the interactive VPTs using a standard personal computing system (HP Compaq EVO D220 or equivalent with Intel P4 processor, 256 MB SDRAM or more, NVIDIA Vanta 16 MB 4X AGP Graphics Card or better, and Windows XP operating system).",

A typical VPT comprises 2 consecutive displays; 1 of the pair displays the target Gabor the subject should identify. The target is presented in the first or second of 2 images, each lasting 80 to 320 ms, at an interval of 500 ms. The subject is seated 1.5 m from the screen and uses a 2-button mouse to activate the presentation of each pair of images at his or her own pace. With subjects instructed to keep both eyes open at all times, detection of the target Gabor stimuli in the first of the 2 images requires a ''left click'' response with the mouse, while detection of the target GS in the second of the 2 images requires a ''right'' click for the correct response. Subjects are informed of a wrong response by an auditory response. Depending on the level of UCVA, at the start of treatment, standardized myopic undercorrection in the form of training glasses of \u00c01.0 D or \u00c00.5 D or no glasses are prescribed for the treatment sessions. These glasses are subsequently reduced in power or removed as visual acuity improves. In some instances, to focus treatment visual training on the worst eye, a neutral density filter to fog vision over the better eye is used in the training glasses. Subjects are presented with a series of Gabor stimuli with the following parameters dynamically controlled: number of Gabors, spatial arrangement, global and local orientation, target-flankers separation, exposure time, contrast, spatial frequency ( Figure 1) .",

In retrospect, this is not that surprising in view of the ''memory effect'' of higher cortical learning programs. After all, one never quite forgets how to ride a bicycle. That compliance plays a role in the efficacy of treatment may also explain why some study subjects responded less effectively to treatment, and this remains a limitation to treatment efficacy. Variability in efficacy may also be a reflection of different individuals' ''final cortical potential'' that could be achieved through the perceptual learning process, which in turn is dependent on the state of inherent neural plasticity. This study supports mounting evidence that neural plasticity is retained in the adult brain. Despite the prevailing belief that adult brain cells do not grow and that whatever limited plasticity exists in the adult brain does not involve structural remodeling, recent cortical imaging studies using 2-photon laser scanning microscopy techniques are challenging traditional concepts. Lee et al. 28 confirmed the presence of dynamic structural remodeling and dendritic arbor growth occurring in GABA-positive nonpyramidal interneurons in the visual cortex of mice. Holtmaat et al. 29 recently reported dendritic spine growth in the mouse adult neocortex as a direct response to novel sensory experience by whisker trimming, providing evidence that sensory input might modulate structural and functional synaptic changes in specific neocortical circuits.",
