Compared with medical therapy, and in some instances with invasive mechanical ventilation, it improves survival and reduces complications in selected patients with acute respiratory failure. The main indications are exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, pulmonary infi ltrates in immunocompromised patients, and weaning of previously intubated stable patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Furthermore, this technique can be used in postoperative patients or those with neurological diseases, to palliate symptoms in terminally ill patients, or to help with bronchoscopy; however further studies are needed in these situations before it can be regarded as fi rst-line treatment. Non-invasive ventilation implemented as an alternative to intubation should be provided in an intensive care or high-dependency unit. When used to prevent intubation in otherwise stable patients it can be safely administered in an adequately staff ed and monitored ward.",

It should not, therefore, be used when patients cannot protect their airway. It is not appropriate for all, and the selection of candidates is important (panel 1). For patients with secretion accumulation or a weak cough refl ex, adequate secretion management with manual or mechanical techniques might be advisable before non-invasive ventilation is declared failed or contraindicated. 2, 3 Compared with invasive mechanical ventilation, this type of ventilation achieves the same physiological benefi ts of reduced work of breathing and improved gas exchange. 4 Furthermore, it avoids the complications of intubation and the increased risks of ventilator-associated pneumonia and sinusitis, especially in patients who are immuno suppressed or with comorbidities. 2 We review present and potential uses of non-invasive ventilation in the acute setting, with emphasis on indications outside the intensive care unit. Although continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) does not actively assist inspiration as do all other forms of non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation, we class CPAP as a non-invasive mode unless otherwise specifi ed.",

Investigators of a worldwide prospective survey of mechanical ventilation noted that use rose from 4% of all ventilators started in 2001, to 11% in 2004. 5 It is increasingly being used in many countries, but frequency of use is highly variable. 6, 7 Non-invasive ventilation is used mainly for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and for cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. Use for hypoxic respiratory failure and facilitation of weaning is still infrequent and is mainly done in specialised centres. 7 In Europe, the rate of use of non-invasive ventilation in intensive care units is about 35% of ventilated patients and higher (roughly 60%) in respiratory intensive care units or emergency departments. 8, 9 In North America, this form of ventilation is begun most often in emergency departments, with most patients transferred to intensive care units or step-down units in hospitals that have such facilities. The low rate of use in some hospitals relates to little knowledge about or experience with the technique, insuffi cient technical equipment, and inadequate funding. [9] [10] [11] Despite these limitations, this technique is increasingly being used outside the traditional and respiratory intensive care units, including in emergency departments; postsurgical recovery rooms; 12 cardiology, 13 neurology, 14 and oncology 15 wards; and palliative care units. 16 ",

            "text": "In a matched case-control study, Girou and colleagues 17 showed that compared with endotracheal intubation non-invasive ventilation was associated with a lower risk of nosocomial infections (including urinary tract and catheter-related infections), less antibiotic use, shorter lengths of stay in the intensive care units, and lower mortality than was endotracheal intubation. Furthermore, endotracheal intubation is uncomfortable for patients and increases the need for sedation and analgesia, which is an independent factor for extended weaning. 18 During non-invasive ventilation, the need for sedation is usually less than with intubation so that patients maintain better spontaneous breathing, can wean more rapidly, and Review www.thelancet.com Vol 374 July 18, 2009 251 spend less time in the intensive care units. 19 However, it should not be used in patients with contraindications (panel 1). Such patients need prompt intubation and inadvisable use places them at risk of need for emergency intubation with its attendant morbidity and mortality. 20 Non-invasive ventilation can be used in a wide range of disorders that lead to acute respiratory failure. We examine the evidence lending support to applications which are graded according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine (panel 2). 21 The success of this technique depends not only on the diagnosis of respiratory failure and patients' characteristics but also on when the ventilation is started 22 and the setting in which the patient is treated. 23 Early use of non-invasive ventilation is recommended because the opportunity for a successful start might be lost if delays arise and the patient's underlying disease progresses too far. However, such ventilation can be started too early-ie, when the patient's illness is so mild that no ventilatory assistance is needed and they are more likely to be intolerant than be helped. 24 Thus judgment should be exercised; most practitioners seek evidence of increased dyspnoea and work of breathing (tachypnoea or heightened accessory muscle use). 25 Another advantage of an early start is that patients who are not in immediate life-threatening situations can be managed outside the intensive care units, provided that the ward team has the necessary skills. Hence specialised units (ie, respiratory intensive care, high-dependency) are ideal for provision of non-invasive ventilation to all but the most sick patients because they off er complete non-invasive monitoring systems and higher nurse to patient ratios than are available on general wards.",

Investigators of several meta-analyses [30] [31] [32] concluded that this technique, including CPAP, is better than is standard medical therapy for reduction of intubation rate. Furthermore, they noted that CPAP reduces mortality. This conclusion was not supported in a multicentre trial 33 that compared oxygen therapy alone, CPAP, and non-invasive pressure support ventilation. The physiological improvements were faster with non-invasive ventilation than with oxygen alone but without a statistically signifi cant eff ect on intubation or mortality rates. However, the very low intubation rate (<3%) raises questions as to whether the patients' population was similar to that of other studies. [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] Meta-analyses 30-32 that compared non-invasive ventilation with CPAP alone in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary oedema showed that intubation and mortality rates did not diff er, although investigators of some studies noted more rapid improvements in dyspnoea scores, oxygenation, and arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2 ) with non-invasive ventilation than with CPAP. Nonetheless, because of ease of use, some clinicians regard CPAP as fi rst-line treatment for cardiogenic pulmonary oedema in patients who do not have hypercapnoea. 39 According to the European Cardiology Task Force 40 for diagnosis and treatment of cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, non-invasive ventilation and CPAP are regarded as fi rst-line treatments together with standard medical therapy when acute respiratory failure ensues.",

In patients receiving a solid-organ transplant and who had hypoxaemic acute respiratory failure, such ventilation reduced intubation rate, complications, mortality, and duration of stay in intensive care. 49 In a second study, 50 this technique lowered intubation, complication, and mor tality rates compared with standard therapy in patients with hypoxaemia and bilateral pulmonary infi ltrates and immunosuppression secondary to haemato logical malig nancies, transplantation, or HIV infection. In view of the risk of admitting patients who are immunosuppressed to intensive care, some institutions now use non-invasive ventilation or CPAP early in haematology wards, either via a face mask or helmet, to avert transfer to intensive care. 15 Obesity is an epidemic health and socioeconomic problem in many countries and predisposes people to chronic alveolar hypoventilation, usually in association with obstructive sleep apnoea. Obesity hypoventilation syndrome is defi ned as obesity with hypercapnia and can lead to acute respiratory acidosis during an exacerbation. Some case reports and observational studies suggest that non-invasive ventilation can ameliorate alveolar hypoventilation and avoid intubation in this situation. 51, 52 Patients with severe irreversible chronic diseases often eschew invasive mechanical ventilation when they present with acute respiratory failure and such ventilatory assistance might even be medically inappropriate for terminal stages. 53 Non-invasive ventilation could be used as an intermediate step to relieve symptoms and to achieve survival in hospital in some patients. 54 Two large US studies 55, 56 in patients with acute respiratory failure and do-not-intubate orders reported that roughly half of those treated with this technique survived and were discharged. Underlying disease was an important determinant of survival: patients with congestive heart failure had better survival rates than did those with COPD, and these rates were much better than were those for patients with pneumonia or cancer.",

To manage such patients non-invasively, including those with COPD exacerbations with severe respiratory acidosis (ie, pH<7\u00b730), staff with much experience in this technique are needed, who are prepared to intubate promptly if goals are not met (ie, haemodynamic stability, adequate oxygenation, good cooperation). 65, 66 Delays in intubation of these patients runs the risk of unanticipated respiratory or cardiac arrest with attendant morbidity and mortality. Predictors of failure for non-invasive ventilation for hypercapnic respiratory failure are no improvement or a fall in pH, no change or a rise in breathing frequency after 1-2 h, high-acuity illness at admission (simplifi ed acute physiology score II >34), and lack of cooperation. Predictors for hypoxaemic respiratory failure are no or a minimum rise in the ratio of PaO 2 to F I O 2 after 1-2 h, Nasal pillows Helmet patients older than 40 years (one study), 67 high acuity illness at admission (simplifi ed acute physiology score >34), presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, community acquired pneumonia with or without sepsis, and multiorgan system failure. Hypoxaemic respiratory failure denotes patients with dyspnoea and tachypnoea with ratios of PaO 2 to F I O 2 less than 200 and a non-COPD diagnosis such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute lung injury, or cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. Several clinical trials [68] [69] [70] have studied non-invasive ventilation in the intensive care unit to avoid intubation in such patients, but results are controversial. Major confounders of these studies were the large diff erences between enrolled patients in type of respiratory failure and severity of illness. For example, Confalonieri and colleagues 71 assessed use of this technique in patients with acute respiratory failure due to severe community-acquired pneumonia, including patients with and without COPD. Although non-invasive ventilation signifi cantly reduced need for endotracheal intubation and length of hospital stay, in a subgroup analysis only patients with COPD benefi ted. Observational studies 72, 73 suggest that noninvasive ventilation is not useful for the avoidance of intubation when hypoxaemic acute respiratory failure is caused by community-acquired pneumonia in the absence of COPD.",

Oxygenation improved similarly within the fi rst hour in both groups, and only 31% of patients in the non-invasive ventilation group needed intubation. Patients in the immediate intubation group developed serious complications, especially infections, more frequently than did those in the non-invasive group.

Of these patients, intubation was avoided in 54%, which was associated with much lowered morbidity (by about 40%) and mortality rates (roughly 30%). This fi nding suggests that in real-life situations and in expert hands only about 15% of such patients can be treated successfully with this technique; mainly those with a low severity of illness, not in shock, and rapid improvement in oxygenation after therapy is started.",

Further more, in one study, mortality in the intensive care unit decreased in a subgroup of patients with hyper capnia. 83 However, results from two previous randomised trials 84, 85 showed no reduction in reintubation rates, and one 85 reported a signifi cantly higher mortality in the intensive care unit in the non-invasive group, associated with longer delays in reintubation than in the control group (12 h vs 2 h) . These fi ndings led some researchers to conclude that non-invasive ventilation should not be used for extubation failure. However, only 10% of enrolled patients had COPD, perhaps predisposing to less favourable fi ndings than seen in other studies. Furthermore, outcomes were improved in the group of controls who crossed over to non-invasive ventilation after they met criteria for respiratory failure,which suggests that some patients randomly assigned to this group started too early before they were clearly good candidates. Although controversial, accumulating evidence suggests that this technique has a role in treatment of extubation failure, but mainly in patients with hypercapnic and congestive heart failure who are at high risk for extubation failure. Furthermore, patients should be monitored closely to avoid delays in intubation.",

During CPAP, a constant positive pressure is applied to raise functional residual capacity and open fl ooded alveoli in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary oedema.

The higher pressure is delivered until the inspiratory fl ow rate falls below a target pressure. In this way, pressure-support ventilation allows the patient to set not only breathing rate but also inspiratory and expiratory durations, the feature that distinguishes it from other ventilator modes. Bilevel ventilation, the combination of pressure support to reduce inspiratory work and extrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure to counterbalance intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure, achieves a greater reduction in work of breathing than does either mode alone, at least in patients with COPD. 91 Pressure-control ventilation, 92 like pressure-support ventilation, fl uctuates between high inspiratory and low expiratory pressures, but contrasts with pressure-support ventilation in that the ventilator cycles into expiration when a preset inspiratory time is reached so that the patient is unable to control the duration of inspiration. Proportional-assist ventilation 93 targets spontaneous inspiratory fl ow rate as a surrogate of patients' eff ort and might improve synchrony between patient and ventilator and tolerance in some patients. Although this mode might be more comfortable and needs fewer adjustments than some pressure-support modes, 93 it is more complex to use than pressure-support ventilation and has not been widely adopted.

            "text": "Ventilators and monitoring systems have improved and might be important in the success of non-invasive ventilation. Specifi cally, most new ventilators have modes that compensate for air leaks, improved and sometimes adjustable triggering, systems to achieve best possible synchrony, and minimise rebreathing of carbon dioxide. 104, 105 Additionally, humid ifi cation of the upper airway is important to improve comfort and tolerance. Heated passover humifi diers might reduce work of breathing and carbon dioxide accumulation compared with heat and moisture exchangers, mainly because dead space and resistance are lessened with the non-invasive technique. 106 Eff ectiveness of non-invasive ventilation in specifi c diseases is well documented and quantifi ed ( exacerbations of COPD with a theoretical model that used a decision-tree analysis constructed from a meta-analysis of randomised trials. They concluded that non-invasive ventilation was very cost-eff ective. Plant and co-workers 110 reported that when implemented on a ward, this technique reduces costs (by avoiding admission to intensive care) and improves outcomes compared with traditional medical treatment. Furthermore, the reduced rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia achieved with non-invasive ventilation not only off ers clinical benefi ts for patients but also might have fi nancial advantages for hospitals. For example, the cost of respiratory failure complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia is very high, which creates a strong fi nancial incentive for hospitals to prevent this potentially life-threatening and expensive complication. 111",

            "text": "Non-invasive ventilation has an important role in the management of respira tory failure in acute-care hospitals. Its use to treat acute respiratory failure related to COPD exacerbations, cardio genic pulmonary oedema, and patients in immuno suppressed states has gained wide acceptance. Many other potential applications are undergoing further investiga tion. Furthermore, because intensive care units are often full, use of this technique in other settings is becoming common in many hospitals, but patients should be selected carefully to assure safety. We expect expanded use of non-invasive ventilation as new applications are explored and caregivers develop skill in the technique, but caution should be exercised to restrict use to appropriate applications (ie, avoiding patients with contraindications or excessive delays in intubation). Much variability exists between institutions in how often, with which mode, and in which setting this technique is applied and eff orts should be made to ensure that acquisition of skills helps to narrow these diff erences.",
