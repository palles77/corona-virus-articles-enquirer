Reading and assimilating a broad range and large number of reports as they appear on a daily basis has already become increasingly burdensome. 3, 4 The HealthMap project has begun to address this challenge through automated querying, filtering, integration, and visualization of Web-based reports on infectious disease outbreaks, to facilitate knowledge management and early detection. 5, 8 A freely available Web site operating since September 2006, HealthMap.org integrates data from a variety of electronic sources, including news through the Google News aggregator, expert-curated accounts such as ProMED Mail, and validated official alerts such as World Health Organization announcements. Through the use of automated text processing algorithms, the system classifies alerts by location and disease and then overlays them on an interactive geographic map. It currently processes an average of 30 disease alerts per day; with the default 30-day time window, the system typically displays approximately 1,000 alerts at any particular time. The filtering and visualization features of HealthMap thus serve to bring structure to an otherwise overwhelming amount of information, enabling the user to quickly and easily see those elements pertinent to her area of interest.",

Most notably, GPHIN was able to identify the 2002-2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) well in advance of official reporting. 10, 11 On an ongoing basis, GPHIN also provides a large fraction of initial outbreak reports directly to the WHO for investigation. 1, 2 Another successful online disease alerting service is the ProMED Mail email announcement list, with 38,000 subscribers and a panel of expert moderators.

For example, in the case of the Google News aggregator, the system examines the headline, then the description, which generally consists of the first one or two sentences of the article, followed by the article's body text, and finally, the name of the online news source. Frequently, a publication originating in one area will refer to events occurring in another area, making the publication name and location an unreliable source for the location of the alert. However, articles that don't refer to a well-known location, such as \"Suburban school closed after flu outbreak,\" generally refer to a location near the publication headquarters.

A further disadvantage of the dictionary approach is that the system can only identify locations and diseases already known and stocked in the database. Moreover, a key step in enhancing the parser resolution consists of augmenting the database by capturing correct locations and disease names, often involving careful manual data entry. As national borders shift and names of places change, albeit infrequently, the system must be manually updated to reflect new geography.

Further, the language expert need have only very minimal technical knowledge with respect to natural language syntax or software development to contribute to the dictionary.

For diseases, we will be adding more disease categories and refining our disease taxonomy, as well as tagging diseases with category metadata to allow for improved searching. We will also explore more advanced techniques such as fuzzy matching and Bayesian machine learning for improving the resolution and accuracy of our automated classification algorithms, as well as categorizing alerts by relevancy, clustering similar alerts, and extracting other useful attributes. [27] [28] [29] On the human side, taking inspiration from the highly successful Wikipedia model, 30 we plan to work with networks of experts to evaluate community collaboration as a mechanism for alert acquisition and classification.",

Comprehensive evaluation of these types of systems and data sources is also an important area and part of our ongoing and future research and collaboration with other disease tracking systems such as GPHIN, EpiSPIDER, MedISys, and Argus, would enable an in-depth comparison. With that said, there are a few broad comparisons we can draw between systems. One key area is accessibility: HealthMap is freely available to the public, whereas some systems are currently closed systems, requiring either paid subscription or approved access. Another key area is in the use of automation. While we certainly perform manual curation in maintaining HealthMap, our goal is to maximize automation in order to leverage the human contribution. The value of a full-time staff of language and domain experts to read and analyze reports around the clock should also be addressed as part of a broader research initiative. 6,7",

In particular, adding more languages and expanding our usage of general data sources such as newspapers and blogs will increase coverage and further demonstrate the value of the visualization and filtering features. Moreover, only as time progresses, as more people use the system, and further significant outbreaks unfold in the global disease ecosystem, will we know the true potential of the software, and how best to improve it.",
