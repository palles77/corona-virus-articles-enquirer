Newer, point-of-care test (POCT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based commercial tests are now available. One such test is the cobas Liat influenza A/B and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) assay (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) (Liat), an automated multiplex PCR system with time to result of 20 min [4] . Previous studies have found its performance to be excellent, with sensitivity/specificity in the region of 100%/97.1e100% for influenza A and 97.8%e100/99.5e99.7% for influenza B when fresh prospectively collected samples are tested [3, 5] . However, when testing is performed outside laboratories in the ED, there is increased risk of errors such as testing the wrong sample because of transcription errors or poor use of the equipment by non-laboratory staff. Evaluations of real-world deployments outside laboratories are key to assessing the use of POCT in effective patient pathways.",

Liat appeared to be less sensitive than in earlier studies [3, 5] for both influenza A and B (86.3% and 84.6%, respectively). Importantly, negative Liat patients were retested more often than positive Liat patients (83.9% vs 29.9%; P < 0.0001). This means that the positive Liat results analysed may disproportionally reflect those patients where the clinicians doubted the validity of the result and so requested a second sample. Perhaps also likely is that this represents the performance of the Liat assay outside the research setting. Errors in sample collection, testing and result recording are more likely when performed alongside normal clinical duties. Rather than a weakness, this is viewed as a strength of this study as it demonstrates the actual performance of Liat 'in the field'.",

It was not practical or cost-efficient to prospectively retest original samples in real time. This raises the possibility that samples may have become negative in the interim between the two tests. It should be noted, however, that if Liat gave a positive result and the confirmatory sample gave a negative result, this would represent a false-positive result in the analysis. Falsepositive results only impact specificity (not sensitivity), and this analysis found Liat to have excellent specificity. The key limitation of this approach is the potential for a selection bias stemming from the fact that only 65.4% of Liat results were retested, allowing analysis of the Liat result. Despite this limitation, which may lead to an underestimate of sensitivity, it is felt that the analysis provides useful insights into the performance of the test in a real-world setting, with fresh samples collected by staff prospectively during routine clinical practice being tested in real time during a high-incidence year for both influenza A and B.",
