            "text": "The response to the 2002-03 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), although effective, was hindered by initial confusion about the identity of the causative pathogen, 1 uncertainty about the epidemiology of transmission and spread, 2 and difficulties with the flow of information owing to political rivalries. 3 Recurrence of the SARS epidemic in Toronto highlighted the potential difficulties of containing similar outbreaks of unfamiliar and highly contagious organisms. 4 Naturally occurring diseases such as SARS offer valuable lessons in preparation for a deliberate release of biological agents by terrorists. But there is a darker side to the relation between naturally emerging infections and bioterrorism. Whereas clinicians and policy makers view diseases like SARS as public-health threats, terrorists could see them as weapons of opportunity.",

The mortality rate from SARS during the 2002-03 epidemic exceeded 40% in elderly and debilitated people. 6 SARS also killed people who were young and otherwise healthy. The demographic profile of healthcare workers who died of SARS is comparable to that of military personnel. Therefore, SARS coronavirus has the potential to be employed as a weapon targeted at military units. Moreover the prolonged convalescence of those who survive SARS infection would further strain the resources of the nation or military units attacked. 7 Unlike smallpox, access to SARS coronavirus is not heavily restricted; it is conceivable that the virus could be obtained from the wild. Many deaths from SARS during the 2002-03 epidemic were in parts of the world where security of the remains is not guaranteed. As a result, several nations have access to specimens from which large quantities of SARS coronavirus could be cultivated. Furthermore, the virus could be obtained from the animal species that seem to be its natural reservoirs.",

No clinical, radiographic, or laboratory feature easily distinguishes SARS from other respiratory infections. So an attack coinciding with the influenza season may not be detected until after widespread transmission has taken place. Detection of the epidemic of 2002-03 was helped by a limited geographical distribution, which was the result of the outward spread of the virus from a single focus. By contrast, a deliberate attack would likely be designed to spread the virus and would result in proliferation of new cases over a wide area. As such, the opportunity to contain the epidemic and to follow a forensic trail to identify those responsible would likely be lost.",

Such measures will complement efforts to reduce the likelihood of laboratory accidents involving SARS coronavirus. 8 It may also be time to reconsider current standards for sharing technical information about emerging pathogens. Although dissemination of the genetic sequence of SARS coronavirus could advance research on countermeasures, it could also help those who intend harm. Greater accountability for access to such information is needed. The scientific and clinical communities should direct the structure and application of such regulations.",

Wide distribution of a validated, rapid diagnostic assay for the detection of SARS coronavirus in patients with a suspicious clinical syndrome will be a critical aid to detecting an attack. ",

In summary, PCR was successful in only two cases, suggesting that in 83% of samples the PCR reactions started from less template molecules than is needed for positive identification. 5, 6 This finding is probably the result of several factors: PCR inhibition by co-extracted soil components or degraded collagen, the minute amounts of nucleic acids and high degree of fragmentation of the old DNA in the samples (our attempts to amplify larger caf1 PCR products failed), chemical modification of the nucleic acids, and severe DNA denaturation by alkaline treatment with lime. 5, 10, 13 The poor state of sample preservation is confirmed by the high degree of racemisation of aspartic acid (D/L ratio higher than 0\u00b708) 14 and depleted aminoacid content (14% compared with modern bone).

However, success against a naturally occurring outbreak should not be misinterpreted as evidence of preparedness for bioterrorism. The difficulties in detecting and managing an outbreak of SARS will be magnified in a deliberate attack with this or a similar agent. Success in responding to emerging infections such as SARS should be measured by both our effectiveness in stopping naturally occurring outbreaks as well as our ability to prevent those who would use such opportunities to do harm.Infectious Diseases Vol 4 August 2004 http://infection.thelancet.com",
