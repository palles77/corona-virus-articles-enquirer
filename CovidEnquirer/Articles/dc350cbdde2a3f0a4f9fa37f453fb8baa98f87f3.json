In patients with ARDS pulmonary sepsis probably results from an increased susceptibility of their upper respiratory tract to bacterial colonization, mainly by Gram-negative bacilli from the hospital environment or from the endogenous intestinal flora [l] . Several animal models have been developed to study ARDS. Recently, Campbell et al. [4] demonstrated the devastating effects of nosocomial superinfection with Gram-negative bacteria on the outcome of oleic acid-induced lung injury in anaesthetised, intubated and multi-catheterized baboons. It is not known whether prognostically significant superinfection occurs when pneumotoxins are given to intact animals. This question is particularly relevant to those compounds that lead to respiratory insufficiency and death after a few days of illness, with genera1 debilitation and weight loss, a situation shown to be associated with diminished antibacterial defence [S] .",

Germ-free animals are mainly used in studies of nutrition, immunoiogy and host-parasite relations, radiobiology and metabolism of foreign and endogenous compounds by the gut microflora [ 11, 13, 17 ]. The respiratory system of germ-free animals has not received much attention. Germ-free rats have smaller lungs on a body weight basis than conventional rats [19] and this was also found in the present study. Histologically, the lungs from germ-free animals have fewer alveolar macrophages and lymphoid aggregates [20, 21] . Functionally, the alveolar macrophages from germ-free rats have been shown to be less competent in terms of phagocytosis, chemotactic responsiveness, lysosomal activity, and cytotoxicity [20, 22] . It was therefore conceivable that the inflammatory response to lung cell damage might differ between germ-free and conventional animals. This could in turn influence the prognosis of such damage, regardless of the occurrence of superinfection.",
