            "text": "Late in 2019 a novel coronavirus (named SARS-Cov-2 later on) was detected in mainland China originating from the Wuhan province. The importance of the disease took some time to be acknowledged 1,2 , resulting in a fairly significant number of infected persons who subsequently spread the disease throughout China 3 (all provinces had at least one case on January 30th), then world-wide. This makes it essential to explore the way the epidemic may spread in the near future. In the present work we proposed several scenarios to this aim. While it is obviously hazardous to advance models of epidemics before their course has been completely unfolded, we think that it is helpful to evaluate methods meant to understand their ongoing course. In particular by following how the epidemic developed at places other than its original site of onset, we would be able to detect any unexpected development course that might be used by health authorities to react very early on. This would be extremely useful to detect patterns created by socio-political measures meant to contain the disease or mutants of the virus which would result into higher contagion or virulence, thus prompting a rapid response.",

These viruses have the option to pass from a -gut tropism\u2016 version to a -lung tropism-instance, as was observed for other coronavirus outbreaks). [4] [5] [6] [7] Depending on the infected person or virus spread dynamics, coronavirus effects can be more or less severe: the virus can either preserve its lung tropism with adverse impact or act as a -gut tropism\u2016 version and be relatively harmless. First reports established that the novel 2019 instance also induces gut symptoms 8 . Its genetic build up and evolution is still subject to intense research 9 . This multifaceted behaviour may result in unexpected local courses of the epidemic as suggested in a scenario of a -double epidemic\u2016, as proposed for the SARS 2003 worldwide epidemic 10 , except that in the present situation we would be witnessing the effect of a single epidemic with modulated effects and propagation depending on the affected patients and random virus mutations.",

            "text": "A secondary propagation route Due to the versatility of the virus, in addition to interfering with the immune response, contagion may involve a variety of causes, such as environments contaminated with virus carrier secretions, dirty water effluents, besides the expected direct contamination via aerosols. This makes that the oro-fecal route should be considered as an important complement of contact with the virus (recent information sustains this hypothesis 11 ).This was observed at the Amoy Gardens cluster of cases for SARS 12, 13 . This observation prompted us to include in our model, besides the major respiratory route, a secondary propagation route, which is not a direct human-to-human propagation but rather some indirect vector (or environment element) to/from human. A second important consequence of assuming the presence of an indirect route is that the selection pressure on virus mutants will differ considerably between lung tropism and gut tropism. Finally, there may be a difference in incubation time, the -gut tropism\u2016 version of the virus would possibly cause less fever 14 . This hypothesis is consistent with some propagation patterns, e.g. the first case in Macau, which was not detected at the border, implying that that the affected person did not have fever. We should note that this makes the disease considerably more dangerous in terms of propagation because carriers are, at least for some time \"invisible\" and display a risky behavior 15, 16 .",

We continue with a simulation of the propagation of the epidemic in Shenzhen: the epidemic seems to be relatively under control with a final epidemic size of around 1,000. The next simulation explores the case of Singapore: the results (not shown here) are similar to those of Shenzen, there the epidemic does not appear to be self-sustained; the model predicts an epidemic size of 130.

In addition, the quality of the results given by the model depends directly on the quality of the data input, and it seems likely that some of the reported figures are subject to large error bars; in particular all simulations of this model were done before February 12 th when the accounting procedure for of number of cases was changed in China. Therefore, one should take the exact figures obtained with our simulations with a grain of salt. Yet, the simulation resulting from the model does show some important qualitative features that are now discussed. Specifically, the hypothesis that there exists a secondary route of transmission is meaningful and that two major types of virus effects are present is supported by the simulation data. This has the interesting consequence that it appears that, for the city of Wuhan, the quarantine seems to be effective-of course notwithstanding the need for further quarantine efforts to ensure that it remains under control-. However, since a reservoir is probably present, and the oro-fecal route may be an important propagation factor, the prevention of this transmission element is vital to avoid any resurgence. The first recommendation seems to be the enforcement of strict post-epidemic measures at the possible reservoir sites.",

Our epidemic propagation model, when fit to existing data, indicated that, among all regions analysed (Wuhan city in the Huabei region in mainland China, Singapore, Shenzhen region), the propagation of the disease in the city of Wuhan underwent an original course. It appeared to be substantially facilitated by a secondary propagation route, thus substantiating the beneficial effect of an effective quarantine. The main message of our exploration is that relevant prevention measures that take into account both propagation routes should be implemented to contain the extension of the epidemic to further sites, especially when novel sites are uncovered.",
