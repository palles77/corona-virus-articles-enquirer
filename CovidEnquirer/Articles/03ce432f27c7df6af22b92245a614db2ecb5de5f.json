Here we perform a functional molecular dissection of ORFX, providing insight into the simultaneous orchestration of several overlapping functional elements in a small human-pathogenic RNA virus. We show that ORFX is translated during virus infection, XP knockout mutant viruses are highly attenuated, and XP is a transmembrane (TM) protein that promotes efficient virus release via a viroporin-like activity.

Ribo-Seq is a high throughput sequencing technique that globally maps the footprints of initiating or elongating 80S ribosomes on mRNAs 12, 13 . We infected Caco2 cells and performed Ribo-Seq at 12 hours post infection (hpi). Ribo-Seq quality was assessed as previously described 14 (Fig.   S10 ). Using flash-freezing with no drug pre-treatment (NT), we mapped the translational landscape of the HAstV1 genome ( Fig. 2A) . ORF2 is translated at ~9\uf0b4 the level of ORF1a, whereas ORF1b is translated at ~25% the level of ORF1a, indicating a ribosomal frameshifting efficiency of ~25%. The higher expression of ORF2 is likely a result of higher levels of sgRNA than gRNA in the translation pool. To identify translation initiation sites, we utilized the translation inhibitor lactimidomycin (LTM), which acts preferentially on the initiating ribosome but not on the elongating ribosome 15 . LTM binds to the 80S ribosome already assembled at the initiation codon and occupies the empty exit (E-site) of initiating ribosomes, thus completely blocking translocation. Using this approach, we confirm the two previously known initiation . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

To rule out the possibility of XP directly influencing viral RNA replication, we developed a replicon system comprising an intact astrovirus genome up to the end of ORFX, followed by a 2A-RLuc cassette fused in either the ORF2 or ORFX reading frame, followed by the last 624 nt of the virus genome and a poly-A tail (Fig. 4A) . These replicons provide a direct measurement of translated product associated with activity of the subgenomic promoter. Two ORFX knock-out mutations were copied in both versions of the replicon to evaluate the significance of XP for RNA replication (Fig. 4B ). Experiments were performed in BSR and Huh7.5.1 cell lines, both of which have been reported to support astrovirus replication 16, 17 . Replication was confirmed by an 1200-2100 fold difference in relative luciferase activity between wt and an RdRp knockout mutant (GDD \u2192 GNN) at 9 and 12 hours post transfection (Fig. 4C, Fig. S12A ). The mutations introduced to knock out ORFX had minor effect on luciferase activity when 2A-RLuc was fused in the ORF2 reading frame (Fig. 4C, Fig. S12A ). Consistent with our Ribo-Seq results (Fig.   2C ), luciferase activity for the ORFX reading frame was 14% (BSR cells; Fig. 4C ) and 21% (Huh7.5.1 cells; Fig. S12A ) of luciferase activity for the ORF2 reading frame.

To map the minimal region required for wt levels of sgRNA production in the context of the pO2RL replicon, we gradually truncated the sequence between the start of ORF2 and ORFX. Surprisingly, we found that a replicon containing only the first 4 or 28 nucleotides of ORF2 has very poor subgenomic reporter activity (0.6\u00b10.03 and 12.5\u00b10.1% that of wt pO2RL, respectively). In contrast, including the first 46 nucleotides of ORF2 restored subgenomic reporter activity to 92% of wt (Fig. 4F , S12C).

As expected, neither RNA nor protein levels were affected in cell-derived samples (Fig. 4G ). In contrast, in media-derived samples, XP mutant titers were significantly below wt titers when analyzed by qRT-PCR (fold differences = 0.08 and 0.05, p = 0.002 and 0.003 for AUG vs wt and PTC vs wt respectively; 2-tailed t-tests with separate variances) or virus titration (Fig. 4G ). These analyses indicate the involvement of XP late in the virus replication cycle, with XP potentially acting in either virus assembly or virus release. Since previous structural studies on the HAstV CP 20 and virion 21 have not indicated the presence of any additional proteins in the compact 43-nm virion structure, the more likely role for XP is in virus release.",

            "text": "The data presented here demonstrate the existence of an additional protein, XP, encoded within the human astrovirus genome. XP is important for virus growth, localizes to the plasma membrane, and plays a role in virus release. Viroporins have been reported for many enveloped and non-enveloped viruses and -although they can play roles in virus entry and modulation of cellular pathways -most often they facilitate virus assembly or release 26 . However, no viroporin candidate had been previously predicted for astroviruses. Identifying a viroporin is challenging due to the lack of homology among viroporins from different viruses. Viroporins are typically small hydrophobic integral membrane proteins of around 100 aa in size, with two motifs -an amphipathic \u03b1-helix and an adjacent cluster of positively charged residues; mutation of these residues generally abolishes viroporin activity 27 .

It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/661579 doi: bioRxiv preprint computational approaches, we show that XP fulfils these criteria. XP is capable of permeabilizing cellular membranes and has a distinct N-terminal extracellular topology with one TM domain, thus making XP a candidate class IA viroporin, a class which also includes the influenza A virus M2, coronavirus E and HIV-1 Vpu proteins 26, 28 . Future work will be needed to confirm potential ion channel activity, and characterize ion specificity, structural organisation, and processes affected by XP expression in the context of viral infection. The localization of XP not only at the plasma membrane but also in the perinuclear region raises the possibility that XP may also have additional functions. Whereas the C-terminal \u03b1-helix appears to be associated with the cell-permeabilizing activity, additional functions (if any) of the extended N-terminal domain of XP remain to be studied.",

            "text": "Comparative genomic analysis suggests that the presence of a protein-coding ORF overlapping ORF2 is widespread in mammalian astroviruses. It appears to be almost ubiquitous in genogroups I, III and IV and is probably present in the single genogroup V sequence. It also appears to be present in various unassigned sequences and clades. ORFX frequently has a hydrophobic stretch that is often predicted to be a TM domain and in other cases may represent a non-canonical TM domain refractory to detection with standard TM-predicting software (as appears to be the case for HAstV1). While normally absent from genogroup II astroviruses, an ORFX appears to be present in one clade (herein referred to as IId), whereas in the clade referred to herein as IIc we predicted an ORFY in the \u22121 instead of +1 frame, and accessed via ribosomal frameshifting instead of leaky scanning. Given the sporadic appearance of an overlapping ORF across the genogroup II phylogeny, it seems likely that the genogroup II ORFX and ORFY evolved independently from ORFX in genogroups I, III and IV, and may also therefore have different functions. In contrast, these other ORFXs may or may not have a common ancestor and/or common function (it is unclear to what extent genogroups I, III and IV form a monophyletic group; Fig. S1, Fig. S2 ). The N-terminal ~70 aa of CP are dispensable for particle assembly and likely structurally disordered 20 and may therefore be evolutionarily fairly flexible. Thus, this region of ORF2 may be unusually tolerant to the coding constraints imposed by overlapping genes. Together with the high translation level of sgRNAs at later timepoints ( Fig. 2A) , and the ease with which 5\u2032 proximal ORFs can be expressed (requiring only leaky scanning rather than more complex expression mechanisms such as internal ribosome entry or ribosomal frameshifting 10 ), the 5\u2032 region of the sgRNA may be particularly well-suited to the evolution of an overlapping gene, consistent with multiple independent origins of ORFXs.",

Writing [q1, q2, q3] = c \uf0b4 [m1, m2, m3] + (1 \u2212 c) \uf0b4 [m3, m1, m2] \u2212 [v1, v2, v3], we found c to minimize (q1 2 + q2 2 + q3 2 ) 1/2 , giving c = 0.79 and 0.78 for repeats 1 and 2 respectively. Thus the estimated ORF2:ORFX expression ratios are 0.79:0.21 and 0.78:0.22, i.e. ORFX is expressed at ~27% of the level of ORF2.Permeabilization assay BSR cells electroporated with RNA synthesized in vitro from the different linearized replicon constructs or with transcription buffer alone were seeded in 6-well plates. At 8 h post electroporation, cells were pretreated with 1 mM HB (Invitrogen) in methionine-free media (Gibco, Life Technologies) for 20 min or left untreated. Next, ongoing protein synthesis was labelled with 1 mM AHA (Invitrogen) in methionine free media in the presence or absence of 1 mM HB for 40 min. Finally, cells were lysed in 1% SDS containing PBS supplemented with protein inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and 250 U/ml bensonase (Sigma). Labelled proteins were ligated with 25 \u00b5M IRDye800CW Alkyne (LI-COR) in the presence of CuSO4 (CCT, 100 \u00b5M), tris-hydroxypropyltriazolylmethylamine (THPTA, CCT, 500 \u00b5M), aminoguanidine (Cambridge Bioscience, 5 mM) and sodium L-ascorbate (Sigma, 2.5 mM) for 2 h at room temperature. The final products were lysed, resolved in Novex 10-20% tricine protein gels (Invitrogen), fixed in 50% ethanol and 10% acetic acid for 10 min, scanned on LI-COR and analyzed by densitometry using LI-COR software. Experiments were repeated 3 times. E. coli lysis assay For the assessment of protein viroporin-like activity in E. coli, E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with pOPT constructs, grown in the presence of ampicillin (100 \u00b5g/ml) at 37 \uf0b0C to IPTG) was added to induce protein expression. Subsequently, optical densities were measured for induced and non-induced samples in triplicate over a time course of 180 min post induction. Non-induced, and 60 and 120 min post induction samples were also collected for protein detection by western blot. Fractionation analysis To analyze the cellular distribution of overexpressed XP fusions, electroporation of HeLa cells was performed in full media at 240 V and 975 \u00b5F using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser. At 20 h post electroporation (hpe), cells were washed with PBS and fractionated using a subcellular protein fractionation kit for cultured cells (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal aliquots of whole cell lysate, cytoplasmic, membrane and soluble nuclear fractions were analyzed by western blot using the indicated virus-or cellular target-specific antibodies. Immunofluorescence microscopy For the analysis of intracellular localization of overexpressed XP fusions, electroporation of HeLa cells was performed as described in the previous section.

Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were determined using the Dual Luciferase Stop & Glo Reporter Assay System (Promega). Replicon activity was calculated as the ratio of Renilla (subgenomic reporter) to Firefly (cap-dependent translation, loading control), normalized by the same ratio for the wt O2RL replicon sequence. Three independent experiments each in triplicate were performed to confirm reproducibility of the results.",

(B) Phylogenetic tree of mammalian astroviruses. The tree, calculated with MrBayes, is based on ORF1b amino acid sequences obtained from 221 full-length genomes. Related groups of sequences (indicated by isosceles triangles) have been replaced in the figure by a single representative accession number and virus name; the total number of sequences in each group is shown in red (see Fig. S1 for the complete tree). Genogroups (according to Yokoyama et al. 8 ) are indicated by background shading. Subgroups of sequences, defined for the purposes of this study only, are indicated in blue (Ia, Ib, etc). The tree is midpoint rooted and nodes are labelled sites. The red line shows the probability that the observed conservation could occur under a null model of neutral evolution at synonymous sites, whereas the brown line depicts the ratio of the observed number of substitutions to the number expected under the null model. Inferred elements corresponding to regions of enhanced synonymous site conservation are indicated. (D) Analysis of an alignment of 127 human and 5 feline astrovirus ORF2 sequences. The upper three panels show the positions of alignment gaps (grey), stop codons (black) and AUG codons (green) in each reading frame. Below, is shown the analysis of conservation at synonymous sites.

Quantitative PCR was performed in triplicate using SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad) in a ViiA 7 Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) for 40 cycles with two steps per cycle. Results were normalized to the amount of SINV RNA in the same sample. Fold differences in RNA concentration were calculated using the 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394CT method. For HAstV1 CP quantification, the electroporated cells were seeded on 96-well plates at different dilutions, and at 24 hpe fixed with 4% PFA and permeabilized with 0.5% triton X-100 in PBS. CP was detected using Astrovirus 8E7 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by LI-COR visualization and quantification. For analysis of virus RNA present in infected cells, at 48 hpe cells were washed 3 times with PBS to eliminate extracellular virus and total RNA was extracted using Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep Plus (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcription was performed using the QuantiTect reverse transcription kit (Qiagen) using random and HAstV1-specific reverse primers. For qPCR, hamster GAPDH-specific (GGCAAGTTCAAAGGCACAGTC and CACCAGCATCACCCCATTT) and HAstV1specific primers (above) were used. Results were normalized to the amount of GAPDH RNA in the same sample.
