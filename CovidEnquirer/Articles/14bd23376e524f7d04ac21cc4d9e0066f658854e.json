            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a serious respiratory infection that has been recently reported in Asia, North America, and Europe. Hong Kong is one of the most severely affected cities. At the time of writing, 1755 people have been reported to have SARS and 298 of them died from the disease within a three-month period. In a review of the first 1425 cases, the estimated case fatality rate was 13% for patients younger than 60 and 43% for patients aged 60 or older. 1 Droplet and contact spread through close personal contact is believed to be the main route of transmission. 2 Healthcare workers (HCWs) are particularly at risk of being infected. In SARS hospital outbreaks encountered so far, a significant number of HCWs were affected. All had looked after patients with SARS or had direct contact with their body fluids such as respiratory secretions, urine and stool. Stringent infection control measures and a sophisticated triage policy were required to minimize the nosocomial spread of infection between patients and HCWs. The general guidelines issued by the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong on the management of patients who require hospitalization ('SARS precaution in hospitals-infection control and risk management approach'; available at: http://www. ha.org.hk/hesd/nsapi) may not be applicable for the paediatric population. 3 The Department of Paediatrics at the Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH) is the tertiary referral centre for probable or suspected SARS patients in the New Territories East region of Hong Kong. This article summarizes the details of the infection control measures and triage policy in preventing cross-infection of SARS among HCWs of the paediatrics department during the recent major outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. The information may be useful for other paediatric units in formulating their own infection control plans to prevent the spread of SARS-associated coronavirus in the hospital setting.",

            "text": "Our results suggest that the combined efforts of proper patient triage, as well as stringent infection control and isolation in a hospital setting, could prevent SARS infection in HCWs. Hong Kong has recently experienced two major SARS outbreaksone in the adult medical wards of PWH and the other in a community complex, Amoy Gardens. 7 -9 The common crucial factor contributing to these outbreaks is that the index cases were not identified and isolated at an early stage. In addition, the workload in the medical wards is heavy and bed occupancy frequently exceeds recommended limits. The wards were overwhelmed by acute admission of over 100 SARS patients in one week. Further, HCWs had limited understanding about the mode of transmission of this new disease in the early stages of the outbreak. The combination of these risk factors perpetuated cross-infection among patients and HCWs in the first week of the outbreak. In contrast, the paediatric wards were relatively less crowded and with fewer SARS admissions. Besides, the paediatric wards have already implemented stringent infection control precautions by the time the first child with SARS was admitted. These infection control measures were adapted from the adult intensive care unit of PWH, which has also prevented nosocomial SARS among HCWs. 5 Our results suggest that our preventive strategies are effective against the spread of SARS. Young children and adults with SARS may have different clinical presentations during the early phase of the disease. 8, 10 In Hong Kong, where SARS has spread to the community, a definitive contact history could not be elicited in approximately 10% of adult SARS patients (personal communication, Dr David Hui, Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, PWH). Hence, an effective triage model for hospitalization has to be implemented. The presence of fever (. 38 8C) and symptoms of respiratory tract infection including cough and shortness of breath are currently the most important criteria for suspecting SARS in the emergency department. 3, 11 Our recent report suggests that fever was present in all 10 children with SARS. 10 However, our medical colleagues found that some adult SARS patients developed fever only two weeks after the initial contact exposure, and a small number of them did not even have fever on hospital admission. 8 Rainer and colleagues 11 also suggested that the absence of chest symptoms could not be reliably used to screen out SARS cases. A number of episodes have occurred where elderly SARS patients were initially admitted to surgical wards (i.e. MR area) for unrelated problems. The diagnosis of SARS was delayed for several days and cross-infection among HCWs had already occurred when the symptoms became more apparent. Thus, the prevailing triage system proposed by the Hospital Authority ('SARS precaution in hospitals-infection control and risk management approach'; available at: http://www.ha.org.hk/ hesd/nsapi) is associated with significant pitfalls. 3 One factor for the apparent success of our preventive strategies may be related to the observation that infected children present with more typical SARS symptoms. Thus, febrile children with SARS could be triaged to the UHR area in which a very high level of infection control measures was implemented.",

Children with SARS may also shed a lower viral load when compared with adults. The fact that SARS-associated coronavirus could be isolated in only two of our nine children with probable SARS supports this hypothesis. Thus far, there has not been any reports of a school outbreak in the community. Hence, children with SARS may not be as infectious as adults. Our results suggest that personal respirators (disposable hoods with breathing filters) may not be required when caring for children with SARS.
