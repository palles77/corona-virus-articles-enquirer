To further determine if acute METH treatment induces an autophagic pro-survival response, we monitored different autophagy markers: LC3 vesicular recruitment and LAMP1. To analyze autophagosome formation, we used anti-LC3 immunofluorescence in a cell-based detection system with HUVECs. In 1 mM METH-treated cells, LC3 protein increased in total abundance and was aggregated in vesicular structures ( Figure 1d ). LC3 (ATG 8) is first cleaved by ATG4 to generate LC3-I and then lipidated to produce LC3-II. LC3-II is incorporated into the inner and outer surfaces of autophagosomes, and as such, remains associated with the autophagosome throughout the pathway. The lipidated (LC3-II) form can be detected as a faster-migrating band in western blots. 11, 12 The amount of LC3-II in the presence and absence of saturating levels of inhibitors, which can be used to examine the transit of LC3-II through the autophagic pathway; if autophagy flux is occurring, the levels of LC3-II will be higher in the presence of the inhibitors. Lysosomal degradation can be prevented through the use of protease inhibitors (e.g., pepstatin A and E-64d). 13 Our data demonstrate that the LC3-I/LC3-II conversion occurred rapidly, within 6 h, after METH treatment and was still detectable at 24 h post treatment in the presence of the protease inhibitors pepstatin A and E-64d (Figures 1e and f) .",

Under pathological conditions, autophagy is considered to have a pro-survival role. 24 Therefore, we asked whether suppression of METH-induced autophagy may accelerate cell death. Therefore, two well-characterized inhibitors of autophagy, 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and chloroquine, were used in parallel in this study. 3-MA and chloroquine have different structures, different mechanisms of action and act at early and late stages of autophagy progression, respectively. 3-MA is a class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor that prevents autophagy at the earliest stage of autophagosome formation. Chloroquine is a weak base that concentrates in acidic vesicles such as lysosomes and disrupts vesicular acidification compromising their degradative and recycling capacity. 26 First, we used 3-MA to examine whether inhibition of autophagy can enhance METH-induced apoptosis. HUVECs were either pretreated with or without 3-MA before the addition of 1 mM METH for 72 h. Cells were stained with Annexin V (green) and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. 3-MA markedly increased apoptosis induction by METH at 72 h, as measured by Annexin V labeling. 3-MA alone caused minimal apoptosis at 72 h (Figures 5a and b) . These findings suggest that inhibition of autophagy can accelerate apoptosis. Second, 100 mM chloroquine also significantly increased METHinduced caspase-3 activity (Figure 5c ). These findings suggest that although 3-MA and chloroquine have different mechanisms of action, they both can accelerate METHinduced apoptosis by inhibiting autophagy.",

To further determine the mechanism underlying METH-induced apoptosis in the context of an autophagic block, caspase activity was measured in METH-treated HUVECs using Caspase-Glo 8, Caspase-Glo 3/7 and Caspase-Glo 9 assay systems in the presence or absence of MEK inhibitor PD98059. Although METH treatment alone resulted in modest induction of caspase-3/7, the induction was dramatically increased when cells were pretreated with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (Figure 5e ). We also investigated the effect of knockdown of Beclin1 on the caspase-3 activity of HUVECs. HUVECs were transfected with Beclin1 siRNA. Beclin1 mRNA expression was detected by real-time PCR analysis. The activity of caspase-3 was also measured in HUVECs transfected with Beclin1 knockdown. The results showed that Beclin1 siRNA transfection significantly decreased the mRNA expression of Beclin1 in the transfected HUVECs compared with scramble siRNA transfection (Figure 5f ). METH significantly increased caspase-3 activity in the HUVECs with Beclin1 knockdown compared with METH treatment alone (Figure 5g ).

Furthermore, METH-induced autophagy in endothelial cells was triggered by inactivation of the AKT/mTOR/p70S6K pathway and activation of the ERK1/ 2 pathway ( Figure 6 ). METH-induced autophagy was regulated by the Bcl-2/Beclin1 complex.

            "text": "METH is an illicit recreational drug known to have effects on multiple organ systems. Exposure to METH leads to neurotoxic effects, which include damage to dopaminergic and serotonergic terminals, dopamine release, endoplasmic reticulum stress, activation of mitochondrial death cascades, glutamate release and hyperthermia. 28 In an attempt to better clarify the molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for neurotoxicity, most studies have focused on oxidative stress, activation of transcription factors, DNA damage, excitotoxicity, microglial activation and various apoptotic pathways. 29, 30 More recent studies suggested that METH-induced neurotoxicity may also result from its ability to induce impairment of BBB function. The BBB has a predominant role in actively transporting nutrients to the brain and filtering harmful compounds from the brain back to the bloodstream. This process guarantees the homeostasis of the brain microenvironment, necessary for neuronal activity and proper functioning of the CNS. 31 METH induces a transient increase in the permeability of the BBB in the hippocampus comparing with the frontal cortex and striatum, which can be explained by alterations in the tight junction proteins and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). 32 However, the direct effects of low-dose METH in modulating BBB breakdown are not fully understood. human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y) resulted in induction of autophagy and suppression of autophagy precipitated neuronal cell death. 1 In addition, another study showed that METH triggers an autophagic sequestering process in the dopaminergic SK-N-SH cell line by inducing the expression of LC3-II in a dose-dependent manner. 33 However, no studies to date have investigated the effects of METH at doses seen in METH addicts in BBB endothelial cells. We therefore investigated the functional role of autophagy in low-dose METH on endothelial cells. LC3 and Beclin1 are two key proteins for autophagy function. In this study, we first demonstrate that METH induced higher levels of LC3-II. LC3-II formation is regarded as a reliable biochemical evidence of autophagy as the amount of LC3-II usually correlates well with the number of autophagosomes. 34 In our study, Beclin1 expression was also increased in a time-dependent manner. Beclin1 has a role in the initiation step and is essential for the formation of the autophagosome. The anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 has a negative regulatory role in autophagy by blocking an essential protein in the signaling pathway, Beclin1. 15 METH induces autophagy in the human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cell line by inhibiting the dissociation of Bcl-2/Beclin1 complex and its upstream pathway that leads to cell death. 35 Our data revealed that METH downregulated Bcl-2, which released Beclin1 from its asscociation with Bcl-2 thereby promoting autophagy ( Figure 6 ). Beclin1 interacts with Bcl-2, suggesting cross-talk between two potential programmed cell death pathways. It has been reported that activation of MEK/ ERK downstream of AMPK leads to an increase in Beclin1 expression. 36 To examine if the activation of the ERK pathway is directly related to the increase of Beclin1, we found that MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 prevented METH-induced Beclin1 mRNA and protein expressions in the endothelial cells (Figures 4e and f) .",

Autophagy can serve as a cell survival pathway in some cellular settings by suppressing apoptosis, and in other settings, it can lead to programmed cell death, either in collaboration with apoptosis or as a back-up mechanism when the former is defective. 39 It has been reported that suppression of autophagy precipitated neuronal cell death following low doses of METH. 1 To evaluate the protective or the detrimental role of autophagy by METH in endothelial cells, we determined cell death (Figure 5a ) in HUVECs for up to 72 h. Our results showed an increase in cell death in the presence of 3-MA, an inhibitor of class III PI3k activity widely used to inhibit autophagy. KOR antagonist and MEK1 inhibitor also accelerated METH-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the early autophagic response is a survival mechanism for endothelial cells and were mediated through the KOR ( Figure 6 ). These results help to rule out that autophagy represents a detrimental mechanism. More importantly, our data emphasize that autophagy is an early response to METH-induced stress and may have a protective role in cell death.",
