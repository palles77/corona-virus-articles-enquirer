            "text": "With increasing numbers of persons from industrialized, temperate countries traveling and/or working in tropical lands, there is a marked need for physicians to be able to diagnose accurately and treat tropical diseases with mucocutaneous manifestations. While some studies demonstrate that approximately one-third to two-thirds of travelers returning from tropical countries experience some health problem, diarrhea is the most prevalent complaint. Mucocutaneous problems, however, are among the top five health complaints of the returned traveler, and comprise 10-15% of health concerns of persons returning from the tropics. 1 During international conflicts, soldiers from North America, Europe, and Australia are often required to serve in tropical lands and sometimes develop diseases not familiar to physicians of their home countries. This was the case for French soldiers serving in Vietnam in the 1950s and American soldiers serving there in the 1960s and 1970s. Recently hundreds of American and allied troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan have developed \"Baghdad boils,\" i.e., leishmaniasis, transmitted by sand fly bites ( Fig. 1.1) .",

Furthermore, whether it is the traveler or the immigrant presenting to the physician, many cutaneous complaints are unrelated to the person's travel or national origin, but are the same conditions seen daily in every physician's office.

The carrier may be a friend or relative who is a returned traveler who has acquired a tropical infection and who has not yet developed signs or symptoms. This possibility has recently been given much attention due to the potential spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or avian influenza virus. On the other hand, the contaminated food may have originated in a tropical or subtropic area, such as when oysters from the Gulf of Mexico are shipped to the Midwest USA and are consumed raw. The resulting Vibrio vulnificus or hepatitis A infection thus produces gastrointestinal and cutaneous manifestations in persons who may not have visited the source of the shellfish. Therefore, it is always important to ask about new pets, changes in diet, or any other change in persons with a suspected tropical disease. On the other hand, the traveler may have purchased non-consumable items which are the source of their dermatoses. For example, animal skins used for rugs or blankets may be the source of anthrax. A non-infectious cause may include nickel-containing jewelry, to which the patient has developed contact dermatitis.",

            "text": "Considerations for deciding the differential diagnosis of cutaneous manifestations of tropical diseases and/or of diseases acquired while traveling must be based not only on the type of lesions and systemic symptoms but also on the patient's history of travel. Because the incubation period of various infectious diseases differs widely, it is important to know when the patient traveled. For frequent travelers, the history may become complex if they report having visited many destinations within the past few months. Because vectors differ with the climate, the season of travel is also noteworthy. Even in a tropical country where the temperature is always hot or warm, there may be a dry season and a rainy season. Because seasons are reversed north and south of the Equator, it is important to know the season at the destination. The duration of the stay is significant, not only because it increases the chance of acquiring an infectious disease but also because it tells the physician if the person was in the tropics during the incubation period of the suspected disease. Whether the visitor was only in an urban environment or also in a rural area is relevant. Whereas a sexually transmitted disease could be acquired in either location, an arbovirus or a zoonosis might be more likely in a rural situation. The altitude of the destination could provide a clue to the etiology of the skin condition, as could the type of sleeping condition. For example, a sexually transmitted disease could easily be acquired in a five-star hotel, but an infection transmitted by a flea, louse, or mite would be more likely in someone who slept on the ground and/or in a tent.",

For example, many antimalarials, such as chloroquine, mefloquine, proguanil, quinine, and halofantrine, can cause cutaneous reactions, and chloroquine, doxycycline, and quinine can cause photosensitivity. Interestingly, chloroquine can worsen psoriasis. A number of agents taken to treat or prevent diarrhea can also cause cutaneous reactions, such as quinolones (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, sparfloxacin, levofloxacin), furazolidone, metronidazole, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and bismuth sulfate; quinolones are particularly likely to produce photosensitivity. Antihelmintic medications, such as ivermectin, albendazole, and diethylcarbamazine, can also produce pruritus and rash. Even diethyltoluamide (DEET), used to prevent arthropod bites, can cause an irritant dermatitis when used in high concentrations. Because many medications in tropical countries are sold over the counter and/or have different trade names than in industrialized lands, patients are not always certain what they received if treated during their travel. Likewise, an injection or transfusion given in a tropical country might also carry an increased risk of contamination. A similar risk might be taken by having acupuncture, tattoos, or body piercing in tropical lands, but these procedures can be hazardous even in industrialized countries, because the first intervention is occasionally done by non-medical personnel and the other two are almost never done by medically trained persons.",

An animal bite or scratch should be easy to remember, but the bite of many arthropods may not even be noticed until after a cutaneous reaction has appeared and the responsible fly, mite, or flea has moved on to the next victim. Exposure to some animals may be more indirect. For example, the spelunker (cave-explorer) may inhale aerosolized bat guano and develop rabies without ever touching a bat. A history of swimming, boating, or surfing can be a clue to an aquatic/marine etiology. Such fresh-or brackish-water activities may increase the risk of infection with schistosomiasis or with free-living ameba, while marine activities may be associated with jellyfish stings, contact with the venomous spines of certain fish, or irritant dermatitis from fire coral. A preexisting skin abrasion or laceration or a puncture wound from a sea urchin or sting ray may result in a secondary bacterial infection.",

Three common examples are measles, rubella, and hepatitis B. Until the 1960s measles and rubella were very common sources of infection in temperate countries, but in the twenty-first century they have become rare in industrialized countries, except for imported cases. Worldwide, however, almost one million children die of measles annually ( Fig. 1 .5) and rubella still causes many congenital abnormalities. Measles is still the number one vaccine-preventable killer of children in the world. Morbidity and mortality are often the result of secondary bacterial infections developing in malnourished infants with measles ( Fig. 1.6 ). In east Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and many other parts of the tropical world, hepatitis B is very common and a major source of morbidity and mortality. Although measles, rubella, and hepatitis B should not be a problem in the immunized traveler, many travelers have not received the proper immunizations because they or their parents had unfounded concerns about the safety of the vaccines. This problem continues to grow as more people reach child-bearing age without ever knowing anyone who has suffered from the childhood diseases common in the first half of the 20th century. Therefore, they do not understand that the approved vaccines are a million-fold safer than the diseases they are designed to prevent.",

If syphilis is the cause of the GUD, it may reappear weeks or months later as non-genital cutaneous manifestations in the form of secondary (or tertiary) syphilis ( Fig. 1.7) . A careful history regarding the primary lesion may lead to the appropriate diagnostic tests and therapy. Some STDs may not produce any genital signs or symptoms and the disease may be diagnosed long after the travel (or the non-travel acquisition), making it more difficult to find the source of the infection. Although over 90% of HIV-seropositive persons eventually develop indirect mucocutaneous manifestations of infection, the primary rash of seroconversion (if present) is not noticed by most patients. Therefore, the diagnosis is usually made when the patient develops systemic signs and symptoms (fever, chills, diarrhea, weight loss, lymphadenopathy) and/or develops one or more of the opportunistic infections, neoplasms, or inflammatory skin problems frequently seen in HIV patients. Similar to HIV, primary infection with hepatitis B rarely produces genital lesions. Diagnosis is usually made long after infection due to systemic symptoms or non-specific skin changes such as jaundice. It is noteworthy that hepatitis B is the only STD for which a prophylactic vaccine is available. Therefore, a history of successful hepatitis B vaccination makes this diagnosis less likely.",

There are over 20 HPV types that can cause genital lesions, but most infections do not result in any visible lesions. Because the incubation period of HPVs can be months, or even years, if and when genital lesions do develop, it is often very difficult for the patient to determine the source partner. Therefore, it is usually a challenge for the physician to relate HPV lesions to travel, especially recent travel. Non-oncogenic genital HPV, such as types 6 and 11, result in condyloma acuminatum, which can be treated with cytodestructive therapy, surgery, or with the immune response modifier, imiquimod. Oncogenic genital HPV, such as types 16 and 18, can result in anogenital cancer, the most prevalent of which is cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is the second most prevalent cancer killer of women in the world and Sexually transmitted diseases over 99% of all cervical cancer is caused by HPV. Most cervical cancer deaths are in tropical countries, making HPV one of the world's deadliest tropical diseases (although rarely listed with the other major tropical diseases). There are many reasons why more cervical cancer deaths occur in tropical countries. First, in industrialized countries most women receive regular Pap smears, which result in early detection and subsequent therapy of cervical abnormalities, thus reducing progression to cervical cancer. If cancer is detected, surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy is available. In most tropical countries, regular Pap smears are not the standard of care. Therefore, cervical cancer is often detected too late for successful intervention, even if it is available. Second, there appears to be a genetic susceptibility that allows oncogenic HPV to progress to malignancy. This genetic susceptibility appears to be more prevalent in certain tropical countries. The rarity of male circumcision in many tropical countries appears to be a risk factor for the development of cervical cancer in these males' partners. Third, most of the world's estimated 46 million HIV-seropositive individuals live in tropical countries where no antiretroviral therapy is available. Not only is cervical cancer an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining illness in HIV seropositive women, the same HPV can cause anal cancer, which is a major problem in homosexual men with HIV.",

Except for certain poxviruses which cause orf and milker's nodules, as well as warts and malignancies induced by HPV, viruses rarely form nodules. On the other hand, all subcutaneous and systemic mycoses can induce nodules. Bacterial causes of nodules include Bartonella (verruga peruana and cat-scratch disease), Buckholderia mallei (glanders), Calymmatobacterium granulomatis (GI), Chlamydia trachomatis (LGV), Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis (rhinoscleroma), Leptospira autumnalis (leptospirosis), Mycobacteria spp. (atypical mycobacteria, cutaneous tuberculosis, leprosy, etc.), Nocardia brasiliensis (and other bacterial causes of mycetoma) and Treponema pallidum (bejel, yaws). Protozoan causes of nodules include amebiasis, leishmaniasis, and trypanosomiasis. Almost all helminthic infections that have mucocutaneous manifestations can induce nodules, e.g., coenurosis, cysticercosis, dirofilariasis, dracunculiasis, echinococcosis, filariasis, gnathostomiasis, loiasis, onchocerciasis, paragonimiasis, schistosomiasis, sparganosis, and visceral larval migrans. If the helminthic nodule contains sufficient fluid, it will produce a cyst. Cysts can be seen in helminthic infections such as coenurosis, echinococcosis, filariasis, gnathostomiasis, loiasis, and onchocerciasis. There are also arthropod causes of nodules such as myiasis, scabies, tick granulomas, and tungiasis.",

Herpes simplex virus is a very common cause of ulcers in both tropical and temperate regions of the world. Other causes of GUD are bacterial, e.g., chancroid, GI, LGV, and primary syphilis. Other bacterial diseases that commonly cause ulcers include anthrax, bacterial mycetomas, diphtheria, glanders, melioidosis, mycobacterial diseases (e.g., Buruli ulcer, leprosy, tuberculosis), plague, rickettsia, tropical ulcers, tularemia, and yaws. A number of fungi can form nodules that break down into ulcers, or they can induce ulcers from systemic spread: blastomycosis, chromomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, lobomycosis, mycetomas, paracoccidioidomycosis, penicilliosis, and sporotrichosis. The most common helminthic cause of cutaneous ulcers is dracunculiasis, when the worm erupts from the skin. Two protozoan diseases cause ulcers -amebiasis and leishmaniasis. Arthropod causes of ulcers include myiasis and tungiasis. Many bites (e.g., brown recluse spiders and various snakes), stings (e.g., insect, jellyfish, and scorpion) or venomous spines of various fish can also induce ulcers.",
