Infectious prion proteins are causative agents of many mammalian TSEs, including scrapie (in sheep), chronic wasting disease (in deer and elk), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE; in cattle), and CreutzfeldteJakob disease (CJD; in humans). BSE, better known as mad cow disease, is among the many recently discovered zoonotic diseases. BSE cases were first reported in the United Kingdom in 1986. Variant CJD (vCJD) is a disease that was first detected in 1996, which affects humans and is linked to the BSE epidemic in cattle. vCJD is presumed to be caused by consumption of contaminated meat and other food products derived from affected cattle. The BSE epidemic peaked in 1992 and decreased thereafter; this decline is continuing sharply owing to intensive surveillance and screening programs in the Western world. However, there are still new outbreaks and/or progression of prion diseases, including atypical BSE, and iatrogenic CJD and vCJD via organ transplantation and blood transfusion. This paper summarizes studies on prions, particularly on prion molecular mechanisms, BSE, vCJD, and diagnostic procedures. Risk perception and communication policies of the European Union for the prevention of prion diseases are also addressed to provide recommendations for appropriate government policies in Korea.",

PrP Sc , a scrapie form of a prion known to be pathogenic and misfolded, does not always induce clinical symptoms; therefore, the PrP Sc that induces clinical symptoms is marked as a disease prion: PrP d . However, prions already exist in animals and humans in the cellular form of the protein (PrP C ), which does not have any pathogenic properties. The primary amino acid sequences and the state of modification in both isoforms of PrP Sc and PrP C are identical; however, they have different three-dimensional structures, which give them distinct biochemical and biophysical properties. Also, alterations in amino acid sequences change the conformation of these proteins, resulting in a thermodynamically stable protein variant (PrP Sc ) that can cause diseases in both animals and humans [14] .",

            "text": "When PrP C comes in contact with PrP Sc , PrP C changes into a thermodynamically stable PrP Sc via protein folding; then, PrP Sc converts PrP C into another PrP Sc . After this process is repeated over time, PrP Sc accumulates in the body and results in induction of TSE [15] . Although it is not certain whether TSEs are caused by PrP Sc alone or by a complex reaction with PrP Sc and other factors, such as other proteins, nucleic acids, or pathogens [16] , it is certain that the main causative agent is PrP Sc . However, to explain the replication of PrP Sc within the body, two thermodynamically stable PrP Sc molecules must be separated and combined with other PrP C s. The animal's genetic type and other additional factors should be considered in the process [17] . Therefore, scientists assume that the hypothetical macromoleculeddesignated protein Xdmay play a role in the conversion from PrP C to PrP Sc and continue to search for candidates. At present, dozens of proteins in the cytosol, plasma membrane, extracellular matrix, and lipid rafts are known to interact with PrP C and/or PrP Sc ; however, strong evidence for the identity of protein X has not been revealed yet [18] . Identifying the existence and role of protein X, prion diseases can be prevented and/or treated. Normal PrP C , which is encoded on the gene locus PRNP in the genome of hosts, is a glycoprotein found in neuron cell membranes in animals and humans. PrP C has a w40% a-helical and w3% b-sheet conformation, whereas PrP Sc has a w30% a-helical and w40% b-sheet conformation. The conformational transition from the helices and hydrophobic regions of PrP C is a major cause of the increase of b-sheet composition in PrP Sc (Figure 1 ) [19, 20] . Since the conformational alteration from PrP C to PrP Sc is not immunogenic, the immune system of the organism can hardly distinguish the normal protein structure from the infectious prion structure, except with respect to its stability [21] . Unlike bacteria or viruses, pathogenic PrP Sc cannot be removed by regular alcohol or formalin sterilization processes, and cannot be decomposed by proteolytic enzymes. Moreover, it is resistant to heat, ultraviolet rays, and chemicals. Under three times the atmospheric pressure the materials for prion should be sterilized for more than for over an hour with 2% sodium hypochlorite and 2N sodium hydroxide at 20 C, and equipment should be sterilized for more than 12 hours with the same solution. In laboratories, materials should be disinfected for more than 4.5 hours at 132 C or for 1 hour at 134e138 C by steam sterilization under pressure. Because it responds well to alkaline conditions, highly concentrated sodium hydroxide or phenol is used to decontaminate PrP Sc [22] .",

The disease is transmittable via surgical tools that came into contact with SRM and via blood transfusion. Since blood rarely contains the prion, it was considered safe until a death caused by vCJD from a blood transfusion was reported in the UK, which was alarming to the public. From this case, the UK spent more than \u00a3200 million on a preventive process to protect surgical tools against prion transmission.

The experimental disease-inducing amount of SRM in a single administration is 0.001 g injected orally; 10 g can lead to BSE in all administered cattle [24] . The amount required to induce the disease is very small; a scientific report submitted to the British Council in 2001 states that an amount as small as one speck of pepper may cause the disease [25] . Five grams of an oral inoculum with brain homogenate from a BSE-infected cattle in a primate (Cynomolgus macaques) resulted in the development of a vCJD-like neurological disease 60 months after exposure [26] .",

It is notable that in the study of pathogenic prions, the protein particles have been observed to have many different strains, which are under investigation [27] .

The disease apparently causes an itching sensation in the animals. Other clinical signs include excessive lip smacking, altered gaits, and convulsive collapse [32] .

In the UK, in particular, cow intestines have been used in MBM as a protein supplement since 1972, which accelerated the increase of the occurrence of BSE [1, 38] BSE is a chronic degenerative neurological disease in cows; part of the brain becomes sponge like, and exhibits many different kinds of neurotic symptoms and paralysis, eventually leading to death [39] . In BSE, nerve cells and central nerve tissues take on a spongelike form. After approximately 2e5 years of incubation, the animal dies within approximately 2 weeks to 6 months of development of the disease. Clinical symptoms include extreme sensitivity to external stimuli such as light and sound, neurotic changes (depression and nervousness), positional imbalance, inability to stand straight or move, paralysis in the hind legs, and paralysis of the whole body before death [40] .",

Although BSE does not seem to be transmitted horizontally within species, such findings suggest that more precautionary actions and approaches should [46] . BSE-infected cows show the possibility of selfmutation of the BSE prion, since the prion gene that causes vCJD in humans, which had some mutations, was found in the brains of affected cows. This implies that a wide range of monitoring systems in DNA and/or protein levels is necessary in addition to a strict animal feed policy. Considering the transmission of BSE to humans, control SRM is the most important step to take. Based on recent findings on the relationship between SRM and the occurrence of the disease, the EU developed some guidelines in April 2008 for its member countries to follow regarding SRM. According to these guidelines, the tonsils, whole intestine, and mesenterium are all vulnerable to prions across all ages; the brains, eyes, spinal cords, and skulls of cows that are older than 12 months are considered to be SRM.",

While sCJD is common in older people, vCJD can occur in young people after a short incubation period [58] . There is much epidemiological and laboratory evidence of a strong correlation between variants of CJD and BSE; vCJD differs from other CJDs clinically and histopathologically, and the initial extended exposure of the population to potentially BSEcontaminated food (1984e1986) was geographically and chronologically consistent with the initial onset of vCJD cases (1994e1996), considering the incubation period [1, 59] . The facts that sCJD occurs in old people at the ratio of one to two out of 1 million people and vCJD is frequent in people in their 20s and 30s have led the public to believe that the dietary habits of the younger generation (who tend to eat more fast food such as hamburgers) may be the cause of the disease. However, recent findings suggest that age-related body conditions are the causative factors of the disease [60] . The EU has been establishing countermeasures against the transmission of vCJD via blood transfusion. Current studies are focusing on the possibility of transmission via dental treatment [61, 62] .",

The communication channel for prevention of the epidemic is important. Most of the misunderstandings regarding BSE are due to the absence of or misconception about risk communication and risk management [71] in societies. It is very risky to mention this disease without considering the difference between laboratory findings and field applications in quarantine, particularly when establishing policies that are relevant to daily life [72] . The EU maintains estimations of cow age through a history tracking system called traceability, in which the electronic ear tag of the cow must match its history document before it can be slaughtered. Because of such strict management, BSE outbreak is decreasing in the EU. However, there are still some nonscientific opinions based on the distorted understanding; some people believe that it does not matter to assume a cow's age by examining its teeth while importing SRM and that this disease itself is going to disappear soon.",

In fact, the possibility of BSE and vCJD occurring naturally in Korea is extremely low. The major reason for this is that there are not enough preconditions for such diseases to occur. Korea has historically had few sheep farms. A British national institution reports that one of the main causes of the BSE outbreak in the UK was feeding cows with sheep intestines [25] . However, Korea has not developed sheep farming, so the precondition of the BSE and vCJD pandemic does not exist there. The second reason is that Koreans used to consume cow intestines. For the epidemic to spread, there should be at least some infected entities; after the tipping point (threshold), it becomes an epidemic [76, 77] . Prion diseases have species barriers; within one species, the diseases spread more easily and quickly. However, a step for the multiplication of prions within a species is blocked since Koreans consume cow intestines themselves rather than feeding them to cows. In that respect, it is almost impossible for BSE or vCJD to occur naturally in Korea. If a BSE outbreak is reported in Korea, the cause would likely be from outside the country.",
