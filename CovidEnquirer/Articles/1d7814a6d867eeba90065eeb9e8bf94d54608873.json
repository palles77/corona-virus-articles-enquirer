            "text": "Protein products fractionated from human plasma are an essential class of therapeutics used, often as the only available option, in the prevention, management, and treatment of life-threatening conditions resulting from trauma, congenital deficiencies, immunologic disorders, or infections. Modern plasma product production technology remains largely based on the ethanol fractionation process, but much has evolved in the last few years to improve product purity, to enhance the recovery of immunoglobulin G, and to isolate new plasma proteins, such as a1protease inhibitor, von Willebrand factor, and protein C. Because of the human origin of the starting material and the pooling of 10 000 to 50 000 donations required for industrial processing, the major risk associated to plasma products is the transmission of blood-borne infectious agents. A complete set of measures-and, most particularly, the use of dedicated viral inactivation and removal treatments-has been implemented throughout the production chain of fractionated plasma products over the last 20 years to ensure optimal safety, in particular, and not exclusively, against HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus. In this review, we summarize the practices of the modern plasma fractionation industry from the collection of the raw plasma material to the industrial manufacture of fractionated products. We describe the quality requirements of plasma for fractionation and the various treatments applied for the inactivation and removal of blood-borne infectious agents and provide examples of methods used for the purification of the various classes of plasma protein therapies. We also highlight aspects of the good manufacturing practices and the regulatory environment that govern the whole chain of production. In a regulated and professional environment, fractionated plasma products manufactured by modern processes are certainly among the lowest-risk therapeutic biological products in use today.

This complex biologic material contains hundreds of proteins covering a myriad of physiological functions. Many components still have undiscovered roles. The most abundant proteins, albumin and immunoglobulin (Ig) G, are present at about 35 and 10 g/L, respectively, representing about 80% of all plasma proteins. Less abundant proteins include the protease inhibitors, like a1-antitrypsin (AAT) (1.5 g/L) and antithrombin (AT) (300 mg/L), and the coagulation factors such as factor VIII (FVIII) (a few ng/L), which exhibit potent physiologic activity. Currently, about 20 different plasma protein therapeutics are used for treating life-threatening diseases or injuries associated to bleeding and thrombotic disorders, immunological diseases, infectious conditions, as well as tissue degenerating diseases, thus addressing the clinical needs of countless patients. An updated list of the major therapeutic applications of plasma protein products can be found elsewhere. 1 This industrial process used to isolate therapeutic plasma proteins is known as bfractionation.Q Over 23 to 28 million liters of human plasma are fractionated each year in the world, in batches of several thousand liters, in about 70 factories. Modern plasma fractionation combines manufacturing steps to isolate, in a sequential and integrated manner, the crude fractions that are further purified into individual therapeutic products. Validated dedicated steps inactivate and/or remove infectious agents potentially present in the starting plasma pool. This sophisticated industrial process is performed under highly hygienic conditions in licensed facilities (plasma fractionation plants) that are operated in compliance with good manufacturing practices and following quality assurance principles.",

It is therefore logical that the production of plasma is regarded as an integral part of the manufacture of modern fractionated products. Collection requirements of plasma for fractionation may differ from those relevant to fresh frozen plasma. In a regulated environment, plasma for fractionation is collected by licensed/registered blood establishments (blood centers and apheresis collection centers) that are inspected by the relevant National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs). Compelled by the same safety concerns, the plasma fractionators conduct audits to verify that the contractual plasma collection and quality and safety measures, agreed upon with the plasma supplier, are met. Areas of specific relevance include (a) procedures for donor screening and donation testing; (b) labeling, documentation, and traceability requirements; and (c) the handling of blood and plasma. Such information is part of the marketing license of plasma products and, in Europe, is assembled into a document called the bPlasma Master File.Q Various requirements for the collection of plasma for fractionation have been described in various guides, eg, from the Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention and Pharmaceutical Inspection Cooperation Scheme (jointly referred to as PIC/S), US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and in recent World Health Organization Recommendations. 1 They are summarized below.",

            "text": "Currently, about 35% of the plasma fractionated in the world is obtained by centrifugation of whole blood (brecoveredQ plasma), and 65% is obtained by apheresis. Blood/plasma collection, processing, and storage may affect plasma quality, as well as having an impact on the recovery of the most labile proteins such as FVIII. In particular, risks of activation of the coagulation, complement, and fibrinolytic systems, which may lead to generation of plasma proteases, should be avoided. To better preserve the integrity of recovered plasma and limit risks of activation of the coagulation cascade and of cellular components, (a) good mixing of the blood with the anticoagulant solution (a sodium citrate based solution 1 ) should be ensured from the initiation till the end of the collection process; (b) the duration of the collection should not exceed 15 minutes; and (c) temperature variations of the blood should be avoided. A few hours after donation, whole blood is subjected to a centrifugation that separates the cellular elements (most specifically red cells) from plasma. The mean plasma volume obtained from one whole blood donation is about 220 mL but varies depending upon the volume of collected whole blood (most often 400-450 mL) and donor's hematocrit. Apheresis plasma (also called bsource plasmaQ) is collected from donors through a process where blood is removed from the donor, anticoagulated (generally with a 4% sodium citrate solution), 1 and immediately separated by physical means (centrifugation or filtration, or a combination of both) into components. 3 At minimum, the red cells are returned to the donor while plasma is retained and collected in a container (bag or plastic bottle). The duration of a typical plasmapheresis procedure depends on the number of cycles (and, hence, the volume of plasma collected) and lasts generally from 35 to 70 minutes. Apheresis plasma volume may range from 450 to 880 mL, depending upon the country's regulations and collection protocol. Apheresis plasma can also be prepared as a byproduct of plateletpheresis (bconcurrent plasmaQ), a procedure used primarily for the collection of platelets.",

Pathogenic plasma-borne viruses include HIV, HCV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), West Nile virus (WNV), hepatitis A virus (HAV) and parvovirus B19 (B19). The various complementary safety nets in place during the production chain of fractionated products, from donor selection to industrial product extraction, to optimize safety against these agents are summarized in Table 1 . The importance of viral testing on the safety of plasma products has been reviewed. 1, 9, 10 The extent of viral testing of plasma for fractionation takes into account the ability of validated fractionation processes to eliminate viral risks. 11 Some testing is performed by blood establishments, other by plasma fractionators (Table 1) . Individual plasma donations must be negative for anti-HIV 1 and 2, anti-HCV, and HBsAg. Genomic assays of plasma minipools for nonenveloped HAV and B19 may be performed. 11,12 Relevance of testing for the absence of HIV P24Ag or WNV nucleic acid testing (NAT), which may be justified for the safety of non-virally inactivated blood components, is arguable for plasma for fractionation subjected to robust viral reduction steps of enveloped viruses. The industrial manufacturing pool (usually the cryo-poor plasma that is the first homogeneous pooled plasma fraction) is also tested to confirm the absence of serologic and/or genomic viral markers of HIV, HBV, HCV, HAV, and B19. In spite of the most rigorous donor screening and donation testing, infectious viruses may still be present in plasma fractionation pools. Therefore, the viral inactivation-removal steps that have been deliberately introduced during plasma products manufacture-and that are described below-play a most critical role in ensuring safety. Altogether, these overlapping tests should ensure that the viral load of the manufacturing should is both minimal and significantly below the viral reduction capacity of the manufacturing processes used.",

This process involves successive processing steps at defined ethanol concentrations, associated with shifts in pH, temperature, and osmolality that result in selective precipitation of proteins, most notably IgG and albumin. Precipitates are separated by centrifugation or filtration. In the last few years, the complexity of the fractionation process has increased by (a) the introduction of chromatography to isolate new proteins from existing fractions such as cryoprecipitate, cryo-poor plasma, and Cohn fractions; (b) the integration of chromatography to the ethanol fractionation process to increase IgG recovery; and (c) the implementation of dedicated viral inactivation or removal steps. Chromatography was introduced in the 1960s; however, its application developed mostly in the mid/late 1980s. Anion-exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography are frequently used to capture proteins at physiological pH and ionic strength, therefore best preserving functional activity. 17, 18 Immobilized heparin and monoclonal antibodies are common affinity chromatography ligands. Chromatography is used for 4 specific goals: (a) improvement of products purity, (b) extraction of trace labile proteins, (c) optimization of protein recovery, and (d) removal of viral inactivation agents. Figure 2 illustrates a typical industrial fractionation scheme of standard plasma. Plasma packs (typically for a batch of 2000-4000 L) are opened under hygienic conditions, and plasma is expelled from the containers and thawed at 18C to 48C. Cryoprecipitate is isolated using refrigerated continuous centrifuges, recovered from the centrifugation bowls and frozen at \u00c0308C or colder for storage until further pooling and processing. The cryo-poor plasma is immediately processed for primary chromatographic capture of labile coagulation factors (such as the factor IX [FIX] complex and its components) and protease inhibitors (such as AT and C1 esterase inhibitor [C1-inh]). The prepurified intermediates may be stored frozen until further processing. The coagulation factors/ anticoagulant-depleted plasma undergoes sequential ethanol precipitation steps. This leads to successive precipitations of fibrinogen, IgG and albumin fractions, and intermediates for extraction of other therapeutic proteins, such as AAT (fraction IV-1), or IgM (fraction III).

Use of one, or preferably two, distinct dedicated viral reduction treatments is the current bgold standardQ for all plasma products. The first treatment is performed primarily to inactivate the most pathogenic viruses (HIV, HBV, and HCV), whereas the second reduction step targets nonenveloped viruses but also contributes to added safety against all agents. Most viral reduction treatments are integrated with the protein fractionation process (bin-processQ treatments), but some currently based on heat inactivation procedures are applied on products filled in their final container (terminal treatment). Fractionators are required by regulatory authorities to conduct down-scale experimental validation studies using relevant model viruses to establish the efficacy and robustness of viral reduction procedures. The robustness of the viral reduction procedures in place is exemplified by the absence of transmission of WNV, an emerging virus. 20 Similarly, the lipid-enveloped severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus has been shown to be inactivated by core viral inactivation treatments of plasma products. 21,22 It is also likely, but not proven by validation experiments yet, that avian flu and simian foamy viruses, which also have a lipid envelope, would be inactivated by current processes in place if present in plasma.

Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) can be transmitted by red blood cell concentrates, but to date, transmission has not been identified from plasma or plasma products. Because of its biological nature, the prion agent is thought to be resistant to current viral inactivation procedures used during plasma fractionation. The methods known to inactivate abnormal misfolded prion proteins associated with transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (PrP TSE ) (such as oxidation, treatment with strong base, chaotropic agents, and extreme heat) destroy plasma proteins and, therefore, cannot be used. Still, modern processes of fractionated products would seem to ensure significant removal of PrP TSE , as suggested by experimental spiking studies. 32 As scale-down and experimental transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) spiking models are developed, knowledge on the capacity of manufacturing processes of plasma proteins to remove prions is growing rapidly, although much uncertainty remains because the unknown biological nature of the human plasma associated infectious agent. 33 Several processes for manufacturing FVIII, fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor (VWF), FIX, IgG, and albumin products have been shown to be capable of removing prions in a consistent and reproducible manner. [34] [35] [36] Generally, multistep fractionation processes are thought to be a contributing factor to PrP TSE elimination. Two to more than 5 log removals of spiked prions occur during standard protein purification steps such as precipitation with ethanol or polyethylene glycol (PEG), anion-exchange chromatography, and depth filtration. 34, 35, 37 Mechanism of removal that may encompass an adsorption mechanism is still not fully understood and appears to be influenced by pH and the concentration of the precipitating agent. The partitioning process may reflect some prion aggregation because of prion hydrophobicity and insolubility. The removal capacity of nanofiltration membranes with pore sizes less than 75 or 35 nm has been extensively investigated, 34, 38 and prion removal is likely due in part to molecular sieving. Extent of removal is related to the pore size of the filters and, presumably, to the aggregation state of PrP TSE . Removal is superior with membrane of pore sizes of 15 nm, compared to 35 nm. The nature and origin of the spiking agent used for PrP TSE clearance studies is of critical importance because various spikes differ in size and characteristics. Brain homogenate or brain-derived microsomal fractions from infected animals have usually been used as the source of PrP TSE spiking material. The most reliable and quantitative detection method of PrP TSE is based on animal bioassays, which require many animals and a time frame generally longer than 9 months. In vitro immunochemical methods, such as a Western blot assay, are being used, at least as a first marker of the presence of PrP TSE and associated infectivity, by detecting the protease-resistant fragment. 33 Thus, the risk transmission of vCJD by human plasma products appears remote, but caution should prevail since the biochemical nature of the infectious agent in human blood is not known.",

Several generations of FVIII preparations have been developed since the mid-1980s, providing (a) safety from HIV and then HCV and HBV, (b) improved purity, and (c) enhanced safety from HAV and B19. Current development efforts focus on establishing prion removal. 36 All currently licensed plasma-derived FVIII concentrates are purified from cryoprecipitate. In a typical process, cryoprecipitate is subjected to a combination of aluminium hydroxide adsorption and precipitation, or precipitation only (eg, using glycine), to reduce the level of trace vitamin K coagulation factors (as they may activate FVIII during the downstream purification steps) or load proteins such as fibrinogen. The purified cryoprecipitate extract usually undergoes viral inactivation typically by SD or pasteurization. Many processes include subsequent chromatography by anion exchange, monoclonal antibody affinity (using anti-FVIII or anti-VWF murine antibodies), or immobilized heparin affinity to remove protein contaminants (such as fibrinogen or fibronectin), most or part of the VWF, and the SD agents. 39 Immunopurified FVIII eluate is further purified by chromatography to remove murine IgG ligands that may have leached. Prior to formulation and sterile filtration, some FVIII products are nanofiltered using membranes with a pore size of 35, 20, or even 15 nm if a partial dissociation of FVIII and high-molecular-weight VWF multimers is initiated. Alternatively, some freeze-dried preparations are subjected to heat treatment at 808C or 1008C to inactivate nonenveloped viruses like HAV. Recovery of FVIII, as expressed per liter of plasma, is usually comprised between 100 and 200 IU (1 IU is defined as the physiological activity present in 1 mL of plasma). Factors lowering FVIII yield include cryoprecipitation (ca 30% loss), chromatographic purification (ca 20% to 30 %), and viral heat inactivation (15%-30%). Current FVIII concentrates have a specific activity between 10 and 250 IU/mg. Some products are formulated with human plasma-derived albumin, whereas others contain copurified VWF that helps stabilize FVIII. Purity of FVIII concentrates has not been convincingly demonstrated to enhance immunological safety. Long-term clinical experience indicates that the alleged reduced immunosuppressive effects of immunopurified preparations compared to lowerpurity plasma-derived preparations, as claimed in the late 1990s, were probably unfounded. Processes used that, in part, influence residual VWF, may have an impact on the immunogenicity of plasma-derived FVIII products. Retrospective studies of previously untreated patients show that an SD-treated, nanofiltered, ion-exchange purified FVIII product containing VWF appears to be 2 times less likely to induce anti-FVIII inhibitors in hemophilia A patients than 2 full-length recombinant FVIII concentrates. 40 von Willebrand factor. Because FVIII chromatographic purification removes all, or part, of VWF, FVIII products effective in treating Von Willebrand disease (VWD) are generally low-purity (bintermediate purityQ) preparations prepared from cryoprecipitate by precipitation steps coextracting VWF and FVIII in a ratio of higher than 1. The low purity and the high protein content of these products technically restrict the choice of viral inactivation treatments to pasteurization or terminal dry heat at 808C for 72 hours. One highly purified VWF concentrate, largely devoid of FVIII and, therefore, specific for VWD treatment, is prepared from cryoprecipitate by a 3-step chromatographic procedure (integrated with FVIII and fibrinogen purification processes) using 2 anion exchangers and immobilized gelatin polishing (to remove fibronectin). 41 Viral reduction is by SD, 35-nm nanofiltration, and terminal dry heat at 808C for 72 hours. 42 Fibrinogen. There are 5 registered fibrinogen preparations available for treating a fibrinogenemia or hypofibrinogenemia. 43 Traditional preparations are obtained by multiple precipitation steps of plasma or cryoprecipitate using ethanol and glycine, whereas other modern products are purified by chromatography. Viral reduction is achieved by SD treatment, often complemented by 35-nm nanofiltration or terminal dry heat treatment. Single-step pasteurization at 608C for 20 hours is used for 1 product.",

Over the last few years, assuring the safety of large-pool plasma products has posed formidable challenges to regulatory authorities and fractionators alike. The complexity of the field, encompassing the diversity in blood and plasma product types and manufacturing processes, made it difficult to enact balanced decisions toward ensuring both product safety and guarantee of supply. Since the 1980s, the agencies regulating the plasma fractionation industry have developed a comprehensive set of measures to ensure the viral safety of plasma products. Multiple layers of regulatory oversight of the plasma industry have been established to ensure overlapping safeguards against the risks of the transmission of bloodborne infectious agents. Several regulations, guidances, position statements have been issued by agencies like the US FDA and the European Medicine Evaluation Agency, which are updated as needed. Those cover important safety aspects required at all stages of the manufacturing chain, from activities at blood establishment preparing plasma for fractionation, extending to the manufacturing and distribution of plasma products. Regulatory oversight includes epidemiologic surveillance of the donor population; donor deferral policies and screening practices; mandatory donation testing; testing of manufacturing plasma pools; validation of viral reduction procedures and other production steps; as well as the assessment of product quality, safety, and efficacy for marketing authorization. Most of relevant information on plasma collection is assembled in Europe in the Plasma Master File, which allows establishing key levels of information regarding the quality and safety of the plasma raw material. Post marketing, reports on adverse reactions associated with plasma products should be transmitted to NRAs and could prompt emergency response procedures and product recalls. 10 Some harmonization of the requirements for manufacture and supply of plasma products in the United States, Europe, and Japan is taking place under the auspices of the International Conference on Harmonisation, but much work remains to be done. Such measures, nonetheless, provide the framework through which modern plasma products now exhibit a very high level of quality, safety, and efficacy. However, the rigidity of the regulatory system has been an impediment to more significant technological evolution of the plasma fractionation process because process changes are currently associated to major regulatory work.",
