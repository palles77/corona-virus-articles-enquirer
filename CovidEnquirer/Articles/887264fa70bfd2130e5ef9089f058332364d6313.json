The limit of detection of each STI-MS assay was ranged from 1.739 to 10.009 copies/reaction, using probit analyses. The verification rate for each target organism of the STI-MS ranged from a minimum of 89.3% to a maximum of 100%, using conventional assays and ultrasensitive digital PCR to confirm the STI-MS-positive results. To further evaluate the clinical performance of this assay, 241 clinical specimens (124 urethral/cervical swabs and 117 urine) were tested in parallel using the STI-MS assay and monoplex real-time PCR for each agent. The overall validation parameters of STI-MS were extremely high including sensitivity (from 85.7% to 100%), specificity (from 92.3% to 100%), PPV (from 50% to 100%), and NPV (from 99.1% to 100%) for each target. Conclusion: STI-MS is a useful high-throughput screening tool for detecting mixed infections of STIs and has great potential for application in large-scale epidemiological programs for specific microorganisms of STI.",

            "text": "Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a significant contributor to the global burden in public health and medical care. STIs can cause severe fetal and neonatal death, ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and genital neoplasia. Despite leading to such severe complications, clinical and public health practice sometimes underestimates the importance of diagnosing STIs, and moreover, for scientific research, STIs remain a neglected field. 1 Many STIs are often asymptomatic during the early infection stages, which increase the risk of unrecognized transmission. 2, 3 The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that approximately 357 million new infections of curable STIs occurred each year throughout the world (http://www.who. int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs110/en/). STIs are caused by different microbes, including bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. Unfortunately, infections of different sexually transmitted pathogens often present similar clinical symptoms, so it is almost impossible to distinguish them clinically. 3 Therefore, it is important to develop a sensitive, multitarget, and high-throughput method that can detect various agents responsible for STIs. In addition, rapid and accurate identification is critical for preventing onward transmission, offering immediate intervention, adopting early treatment, and reducing patient management costs. 4, 5 Conventional diagnostic algorithms for STIs include cell culture, microscopic examination, enzyme immunoassay, and other serological investigation techniques. [6] [7] [8] The diagnosis of STIs by culture or serology remains a challenge. 9 Especially for herpes simplex virus and Treponema pallidum detection, cell culture shows low-sensitivity and long turnaround time, making this assay clinically useless. 10, 11 However, over the past two decades, molecular testing has been widely used to detect pathogens associated with STIs. Compared with traditional methods, molecular tests, such as PCR, real-time PCR, multiplex PCR, and microarray, have rapid turnaround times and superior sensitivities. 3, 7, 12 Several commercial kits or systems based on nucleic acid amplification have been developed to detect pathogens responsible for STIs, [13] [14] [15] [16] but these systems still have disadvantages, such as high cost, low sample throughput, and the limited number of pathogens that can be detected in a single test reaction. 3 In this study, the MassARRAY System (Agena Bioscience, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), a detection platform combining endpoint multiplex-PCR with matrixassisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), was utilized to develop a sexually transmitted infection assay (STI-MS) that can simultaneously detect and identify common clinical pathogens implicated in STIs, including herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Treponema pallidum, Trichomonas vaginalis, Mycoplasma genitalium, and Haemophilus ducreyi. Three controversial microorganisms (Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Ureaplasma parvum), still not conclusive evidence whether these agents should be considered pathogens, were also included in the panel in our study. The system comes with some considerable benefits of multiplexing and high throughput, and it has been applied successfully in detecting and confirming various kinds of microbes. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] For each microorganisms included in the STI-MS assay, two different genes were selected as targets. If either of the genes were detected, the corresponding organisms were positive. Such a strategy can avoid false-negative results, thus making our method more sensitive and comprehensive. The performance of the STI-MS was evaluated using clinical specimens from patients with sexually transmitted infections. All STI-MS results were confirmed by real-time PCR and nested PCR. Discordant results were arbitrated by an ultrasensitive digital PCR method.",

Compared to other diagnostic Table 4 Results of confirmatory tests of positive samples by the STI-MS assay and resolution of discordant results following arbitration testing Note: a The total number of clinical samples is 176. Abbreviation: NA, not available. Table 5 Clinical performance of the STI-MS assay for organism identification compared to that of monoplex real-time PCR strategies, STI-MS using MALDI-TOF MS technologies are generally more reliable and can be more easily automated. The STI-MS assay simultaneously detects the nucleic acid from 1 protozoan, 2 viral, and 8 bacterial organisms and analyzes approximately 760 clinical samples within 1 working day. Because of the high sample throughput of this method, the cost of detecting 11 pathogens using STI-MS is less than $4, not including the cost of the nucleic acid extraction. Therefore, the STI-MS method has great potential to be applied in large-scale epidemiological programs for specific microorganisms of STI and provides important information for public health interventions and disease control and eradication.",

Examples of these tested sites include adequate numbers of commonly Neisseria meningitidis and other commensal Neisseria species, which can cause cross-reaction in the screening assays due to their high degree of nucleic acid homology with N. gonorrhoeae. 38 Among the targets used to identify C. trachomatis, a cryptic plasmid has been the most widely used for NAATs. [39] [40] [41] However, it was subsequently shown that sequence variation of cryptic plasmids has been detected in several countries. [42] [43] [44] This demonstrates that false-negative results may occur when a cryptic plasmid is used alone as the target for detection of C. trachomatis particularly when screening clinical samples from this region. Previously, several commercial NAATs used a single target on the pathogens associated with sexually transmitted infections, which led to the emergence of a false-negative diagnostic result, and the infection went untreated and was transmitted between individuals without knowledge before being recognized. 45 To overcome these potential problems, the STI-MS assay uses two targets of each pathogen to increase the sensitivity and specificity and to reduce false-negative results. The results of this study have shown that the STI-MS method was useful for detecting several microorganisms simultaneously with high specificity and accuracy.",

In our study, 40 positive specimens using the developed STI-MS assay were not confirmed by confirmatory tests. One possible cause for the higher number of discrepancies in the clinical specimens for causative agents of STIs may be due to target pathogens with a low concentration, as reported by Van et al in an evaluation of BD MAX assay. 37 Digital PCR has been successfully applied in the field of pathogen detection 46, 47 and is particularly suited to the low-level detection of nucleic acid even with a highly complex background. 47, 48 In the arbitration stage, ultrasensitive digital PCR was performed to resolve discordant results. Thirty-one (77.5%) specimens were confirmed as positive after arbitration testing. To significantly shorten the detection time, ultrasensitive diagnosis methods for STIs are required to detect extremely small amounts of microorganisms directly without culturing the specimen. Based on sensitivity testing, LOD of the STI-MS assay can reach a minimum of 1.739 copies per reaction. Moreover, it was subsequently verified that this method also has a high sensitivity in the evaluation of clinical samples. Thus, when target pathogens with a low concentration in clinical specimens, the STI-MS assay substantially increased our ability to detect potential pathogens and increased the likelihood that an accurate diagnosis will not be missed.",

Most of the previous studies have shown the prevalence of STI ranges from 2.6% to 23.7%, 49 while our study indicates that the detection rate of agents was 68.8% (121/176) among MSM, which was higher than the data in other studies. We speculate that the difference was caused by the improved coverage of screening using this method. Coinfections are frequently encountered among MSM and present a difficult diagnostic challenge for clinical microbiology laboratories. In our study, 55.4% (67/121) specimens were identified as mixed agent combinations, and most of those with multiple combinations included U. urealyticum and M. hominis (35.8%, 24/67). These findings are consistent with those recently reported in a study using a commercial detection kit. 35 As the high detection rates of U. urealyticum and M. hominis might have been caused by infection and commensalism, their roles as pathogens are controversial. 50 However, an earlier study suggested that U. urealyticum and M. hominis combination may be associated with an increased drug resistance. 51 The detection of STIs using the STI-MS approach might be helpful for the timely discovery of mixed agent combinations, and clinicians could prescribe appropriate antibiotics for patients according to the results of identified pathogens.",

Second, the high cost of the equipment and the large footprint of the system limit the application range of the mass spectrometer platform in clinical laboratories. Third, with nearly 8 hours of turnaround time, the STI-MS assay is not suitable for the detection of a small number of samples. Additionally, as anal swabs using in the evaluate stage were archived DNA samples, the limited sample volume prevented us from testing in parallel, using the STI-MS assay and monoplex real-time PCR for each agent. Therefore, additional testing on different sample types (including anal swabs) will be required in the future to evaluate comprehensively the performance of the STI-MS assay.
