            "text": "Nucleocapsid protein plays a critical role in SARS-CoV pathogenesis, and high-level anti-nucleocapsid antibodies are detected in the patients infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Several studies have shown that there exists an interaction between nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) protein. In this paper, we investigate whether the expression of membrane protein can affect the immune responses induced by nucleocapsid DNA immunization. Two recombinant plasmids containing M and N coding sequence were constructed. Moreover, in order to get the antigen for ELISA and in vitro stimulation assay, N protein were expressed and purified from E. coli bacteria. Injection of 20 g of the mixture of pVAX1-M and pVAX1-N into the Balb/c mice could elicit the humoral and cellular responses. The ELISA analysis using the N antigen or inactivated SARS-CoV particles as capture antigen showed that co-injection of SARS-M could enhance N-induced antibody production, especially IgG2a subclass. After lymphocytes were stimulated with 10 g/ml purified N antigen, The CD4+ and CD8+ T cells of N and M plus N group were increased compared with those of control groups, and the M protein could augment the activation of lymphocytes induced by N DNA vaccine. Cytokine ELISA analysis revealed that co-injection of M could enhance the levels of IFN-\u2425, IL-2 release induced by N antigen. Further experiments in field mouse also support the claim that membrane protein can augment the N-specific immune responses. Virus challenge test was conducted in BSL3 bio safety laboratory with Brandt's vole SARS-CoV model, and the results indicated that co-immunization of M and N antigens could reduce the mortality and pathological changes in lung from the virus infection.",

That the SARS genome from Singapore, Canada, Hongkong, Guangzhou and Beijing in China has remained unchanged, as the infection has spread (http://www.nature.com/nsu/030505/030505-10.html) suggests that genetic vaccine maybe an efficient approach to protect from SARS-CoV infection.",

The M gene encodes a protein of 221 amino acids. Analysis of the M protein revealed that a 121 amino acid hydrophilic domain on the inside of the virus particle is believed to interact with the N protein (Qin et al., 2003) . It is further reported that there exists an interaction between SARS-CoV N and M protein and the stretch of amino acids in the N protein may be critical for such protein-protein interactions (He et al., 2004) . Whether the interaction plays role in immune responses induced by SARS-CoV infection is not clear.",

In addition, the basic nature of this peptide suggests it may assist in RNA binding (Marra et al., 2003) . In previous study, N protein is a representative antigen for the T-cell response in vaccine setting (Gao et al., 2003) , and the mice vaccinated with calreticulin (CRT)/N DNA were capable of significantly reducing the titer of challenging vaccinia virus expressing the N protein of SARS virus (Kim et al., 2004) . It has been reported that N DNA vaccine could induce SARS-specific T-cell proliferation and cytotoxic T cells activity, further experiments demonstrate that SARS-N administration could induce virus-specific cellular responses in human cells using SCID-PBL/hu mouse model (Jin et al., 2005; Okada et al., 2005) .

Since analysis of the M protein revealed that a 121 amino acid hydrophilic domain on the inside of the virus particle is believed to interact with the N protein, and additional mammalian two-hybrid assay had proved the possible interactions between SARS-CoV N and the M protein (He et al., 2004) . We suppose that the N antigen maybe reveal more B-cell and T-cell epitopes when the M protein interacts with it. From previous study, linking a Marek's disease virus type 1 VP22 or new castle disease virus to an antigen could improve the DNA vaccine potency (Hung et al., 2002; Termeer et al., 2000) . Because M antigen is also a virus antigen, we suppose that it can enhance the efficacy of the N DNA vaccine. According to this, M antigen is a potential new adjuvant.",
