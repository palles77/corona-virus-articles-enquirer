Owner consent was obtained before sampling. Methods: Fecal samples were collected at admission and 48 hours later. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for ECoV and electron microscopy (EM) were performed on all samples. Results: Only 1 of 258 fecal samples was PCR-positive for ECoV. Electron microscopy identified ECoV-like particles in 9 of 258 samples, parvovirus-like particles in 4 of 258 samples, and rotavirus-like particles in 1 of 258 samples. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: The presence of ECoV in feces of hospitalized adult horses was low. Thus, fecal samples that are PCR-positive for ECoV in adult horses that have clinical signs consistent with this viral infection are likely to be of diagnostic relevance. The clinical relevance of the viruses observed using EM remains to be investigated. K E Y W O R D S anesthesia, anorexia, electron microscopy, fever, gastrointestinal disease, lethargy, PCR",

Historically, electron microscopy (EM) was considered the gold standard for diagnosis of coronavirus in feces. 5, 6 Because of the expertise and equipment required for this technique and its inability to characterize viruses beyond the family level, EM has been augmented in clinical settings by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as this test provides a sensitive and specific diagnostic tool to document the presence of ECoV in feces of horses. 1 Epidemiological information regarding ECoV is limited, 7 and as a result, definitive diagnosis of ECoV in adult horses remains challenging.",

A previously described ECoV PCR technique routinely performed at the laboratory was used 1,6 Briefly, 200 \u03bcg of feces and 2 mL of phosphate buffer solution were vortexed and centrifuged. Nucleic acid purification from 200 \u03bcL of supernatant was performed using a semi-automated nucleic acid extraction system (QIAamp 96 DNA QIAcube HT Kit; QIAcube, Qiagen Valencia, California) according to the manufacturer's instructions and eluted in 100 \u03bcL of diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. Following the manufacturer's recommendations, RNA was converted to complementary DNA as previously described. 6 Equine coronavirus PCR was performed based on a specific 142 base-pair product of the N gene of ECoV (GenBank accession number EF446615). 1 All samples then were amplified in a combined thermocycler/fluorometer (7900 HT Fast; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California) using a standard thermal cycling protocol. 1 A real-time PCR assay targeting a universal sequence of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was used as quality control and as an indicator of fecal inhibition. 1,15 A biological positive control (extracted feces from a horse with ECoV infection confirmed by immunohistochemistry and histology) as well as a negative control (sterile water) were included in each run.",

Although fever, lethargy, and anorexia are the most common clinical signs of ECoV infection, 1,7 these are nonspecific clinical signs that can be present as a result of many different conditions. Thus, we included horses that were hospitalized for gastrointestinal disease because colic, enteritis, and diarrhea have been reported with this infection.3,4,17,18 Horses in the Anesthesia group were included to evaluate the effect that stress (hospitalization, anesthesia) may have had on fecal shedding of ECoV in systemically healthy horses. Only horses that were anesthetized for imaging (CT, MRI, or myelogram) were included in this group to maintain homogeneity of the stressor (hospitalization and anesthesia).",

As a result, ECoV-positive fecal samples are difficult to interpret on their own. Thus, the diagnosis of ECoV infection currently relies on the exclusion of other infectious causes of enteric disease in horses with clinical signs of ECoV along with molecular detection of ECoV in feces or tissue. 3,7 Although this approach is complete, it poses an additional financial burden to the horse's owner. In addition, with this approach, diagnosis may not be achievable in places where testing for multiple equine enteric pathogens is not readily available. Thus, our aim was to determine whether systemically healthy horses and horses with gastrointestinal disorders shed ECoV in their feces at the time of admission to a referral hospital and after 48 hours of stress associated with hospitalization. Based on the fact that ECoV outbreaks have not been reported in referral hospitals, we hypothesized that the overall fecal shedding of ECoV in hospitalized horses would be low. Fecal samples from horses presented to the Washington State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital (WSU-VTH)for evaluation of gastrointestinal diseases or those that were anesthetized for imaging were collected for this prospective study.Prospective, Descriptive study.2.2 | AnimalsAdult horses (>1 year of age) that were presented to the WSU-VTH with clinical signs of gastrointestinal tract disease localized aboral to the stomach and hospitalized for a minimum of 48 hours were included in the Gastrointestinal Disease group (n = 65). Similarly, adult horses (without clinical signs of gastrointestinal tract disease) that presented to the WSU-VTH for diagnostic imaging under anesthesia and were hospitalized for a minimum of 48 hours were included in the Anesthesia group (n = 65).Client consent was obtained from owners before fecal samples were collected. The experimental protocol was reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at WSU-VTH (ASAF# 04793-001).",

Electron microscopy historically has been considered a gold standard for diagnosis of viral presence in feces because of the very low number of false bers 7 and can only identify viruses to the family level.As we hypothesized, shedding of ECoV in the specific hospitalized population evaluated in our study was very low. Only 1 of 258 fecal samples from 130 horses tested in our study was PCR positive for ECoV. The positive horse, an 8-year-old Miniature Horse gelding, was admitted for fever and anorexia of 6 days' duration, and ultimately was diagnosed with colitis. These clinical signs are consistent with ECoV infection.7 Salmonella infection was ruled out based on serial fecal culture. Tests for Clostridia (spp. difficile and perfringens)were not performed.Coronavirus-like viral particles were identified by EM in 9 of 258 fecal samples from 129 horses. Interestingly, none of these horses was PCR-positive for ECoV, suggesting the presence of a novel ECoV/coronavirus-like virus. Further identification of these organisms using deep sequencing would be of interest, but was beyond the objectives of our study. Electron microscopy also identified parvovirus-like viral particles in the feces of 4 horses (3 admitted for colic and 1 for CT of the limbs) and rotavirus-like viral particles in an additional horse admitted for liver disease. The finding of additional viruses was not unexpected. Parvovirus-like particles are not uncommon in adult horses.22 Interestingly, all of these viral particles were identified only in the samples obtained 48 hours after hospital admission.Stress has been shown to affect the shedding of other horse pathogens.[19][20][21] Therefore, it is possible that the stress of hospitalization increased the shedding of these viruses because the initial samples were negative. The clinical relevance of these viruses remains to be determined.Although our results support the overall low prevalence of ECoV in healthy horses reported by others,5,7,13,14 all horses included in the study were from the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Thus, these results may not be readily extrapolated to equine populations in other geographic areas. Moreover, our results should not be extrapolated to foals, where shedding of ECoV infection appears to be more common.23 In summary, we evaluated the prevalence of ECoV in the feces ofclinically healthy adult horses hospitalized for diagnostic imaging or in horses hospitalized for gastrointestinal disease and evaluated the effect of the stress of hospitalization on fecal viral shedding of ECoV. The prevalence of ECoV in feces of the included adult horses was low and supports the findings by others. 5,7 Thus, fecal samples that are PCRpositive for ECoV in adult horses that have clinical signs consistent with this viral infection (fever, anorexia, colic, diarrhea) 2 are likely to be of diagnostic relevance. Although additional testing of other enteric pathogens provides useful information about potential coinfections, our data along with previous work 5 suggests that such tests may not always be required to obtain a definitive diagnosis of ECoV infection.
