In the future, local governments should establish and strengthen eff ective supervision, enforcement of regulations, and legislation. 2 Third, anyone who violates the regulation or law should be much more severely punished than it is today to prohibit similar incidents from happening again. 2 Finally, public awareness of public health and environmental protection issues should be promoted.",

            "text": "More than 16 000 dead pigs were found fl oating in Shanghai Huangpu River last month. 1 It was unbelievable. After investigations, the public and the media focused their attention on Jiaxing, 60 miles southwest of Shanghai, which was thought to be the source of the problem. With the large increase of the pig industry in the area, local farmers have diffi culties in disposing of more than 300 000 carcasses every year, so one explanation is that some farmers thrown dead pigs into the rivers just \"for convenience\". 1 China Central Television has proposed another explanation. For many years, illegally processed pigs have been brought onto the market by black market dealers without being sent to processing pits. Since some such butchers have been sentenced to prison recently, black market traders have stopped buying these illegally processed pigs, and farmers have had to get rid of these dead pigs. 1 Sadly again, this scandal has highlighted some issues in China regarding public health, food safety, environmental protection, and regulation. 2 First, we should improve the management, organisation, structure, and distribution of farms. Second, The H7N9 virus is a new infl uenza virus subtype, and it has not been included in the statutory infectious disease surveillance reporting system of China. No vaccine has been launched yet. The source of H7N9 human infections is unclear, but based on past experience and epidemiological investigation, H7N9 virus might be carried by poultry, in their secretions or excretions. About 40% of the patients have not been in contact with poultry before. China's offi cial media, quoting Gregory Hartl (a WHO spokeperson), stated that although transmission of H7N9 virus between human beings has not been reported yet, there is a risk that mutations in the virus could ease the spread. Moreover, men who are smokers are a susceptible group because of their pulmonary dysfunction associated with smoking. 3 The incubation period of the H7N9 virus is generally less than 7 days. Patients usually present with fl u-like symptoms, such as fever,and cough with little phlegm, which can be accompanied by headache, muscle aches, and general malaise. Patients with severe progression of the disease manifest severe pneumonia, with body temperature over 39\u00b0C and diffi culty breathing. The disease can progress rapidly, accompanied by acute respiratory distress syndrome, mediastinal emphysema, septic shock, disturbance of consciousness, and acute kidney injury.",

However, it is still a great challenge for the Chinese Government to control the infection. Unlike the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic 10 years ago, H7N9 virus does not show signs of human-tohuman transmission, and isolation of patients would not limit the transmission. Immediate culling of infected poultry is an eff ective measure. But more eff orts must be made to prevent further spread of the infection.",
