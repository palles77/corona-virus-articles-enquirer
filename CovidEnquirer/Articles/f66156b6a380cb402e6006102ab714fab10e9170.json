MHVinfected 17CL.l cells were labeled with [zrP]orthophosphate in the presence of actinomycin D and the eytoplasmic RNA was extracted and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. These RNA species range in size from 6.3 X 106 to 6.1 X lo6 daltons. The A59V and JHMV-specific RNAs have identical molecular weights and comigrate in agarose gels. The largest intracellular RNA species is identical to RNA isolated from purified virions, as determined by agarose gel electrophoresis and oligonucleotide fingerprint studies of ribonuclease T1 digests. Oligonucleotide fingerprints of the six subgenomic RNAs show that the sequences they contain are present in virion RNA, confirming their virus-specific nature. The fingerprinting studies also demonstrate that the six subgenomic RNA species make up a nested set. The sequences present in each RNA species are also present in all larger RNA species. These larger RNAs also contain additional sequences consistent with their greater size. The subgenomic RNAs fulfull many of the criteria for mRNAs. Possible mechanisms for generating these RNAs are discussed.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are widespread in nature and have been associated with several diseases in infected hosts (Robb and Bond, 1979a) . Coronaviruses are defined as pleomorphic enveloped particles about 100 nm in diameter which have characteristic bul- bous projections on their surface, bud through the endoplasmic reticulum rather than the plasma membrane, and contain RNA (Tyrell et al., 1978) . Several studies of coronavirus genomic RNA have been reported (Lomneczi, 197'7; Lomneczi and Kennedy, 1977; Yogo et al., 1977; Lai and Stohlman, 1978; Macnaughton and Madge, 1978; Schochetman et al., 1977; Tannock and Hierholzer, 1978; Guy and Brian, 1979; Wege et al., 1978) . These studies have indicated that the coronavirus genome is a large (5.4-8.1 X lo6 daltons) singlestranded RNA which is polyadenylated and is infectious. These properties identify the coronaviruses as positive-stranded RNA viruses. In contrast to the data obtained on coronavirus virion RNA, few data have been published on intracellular coronavirusspecific RNA. Mishra and Ryan (1973) reported that porcine kidney cells infected with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) contained actinomycin D-resis-tent RNA species which sedimented between 18 and 28 S. Robb and Bond (1979b) have studied murine hepatitis virus (MHV)-infected cells and found that deproteinized RNA from virus-specific polysomes sedimented between 10 and 28 S. RNA in this size range was recently demonstrated to code for two MHV structural proteins (Siddell et al., 1980) . Stern and Kennedy (1980a,b) have identified six virus-specific RNA species in cells infected with avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV).",

The cytoplasmic RNA was extracted, denatured with glyoxal, and analyzed by electrophoresis on an agarose gel (Fig. 2) . Seven RNA species, designated l-7 in decreasing order of size, were reproducibly present in JHMV-and A59Vinfected cells. JHMV-infected cells synthesize less RNA5 than A59V-infected cells (Table 1) . Although the band representing JHMV-specific RNA5 is barely visible in Fig. 2 (lane J), this RNA species could be seen with a longer exposure of the autoradiograph, was reproducibly present in infected cell extracts, and can be better seen in Fig. 6 . In addition, three minor RNA species were often observed, although not in every experiment. The largest of these RNAs migrated between RNAs 3 and 4 just faster than 28 S rRNA. Two minor RNAs migrating faster than RNA7 were also sometimes observed. These RNAs were not studied extensively due to difficulty in preparing sufficient material and their inconsistent appearance. No discrete bands were identified in mock-infected extracts. The largest MHV-specific RNA, RNA 1, coelectrophoreses with virion RNA and represents the intracellular form of the genome. In contrast to the size differences we have observed between A59V- . and JHMV-specific proteins (Bond et al., 1979) , A59V-and JHMV-specific RNAs comigrate in agarose gels. The amount of virus-specific RNA synthesized in A59V-infected cells is, however, about 30% greater than that synthesized in JHMVinfected cells as determined by the incorporation of rSH]uridine or [=Plorthophosphate into acid-insoluble cytoplasmic material in the presence of actinomycin D.",

            "text": "The data presented above indicate that MHV-infected cells synthesize at least seven virus-specific RNAs. The largest of these RNAs, RNAl, is nearly identical to virion RNA, as judged by oligonucleotide fingerprinting. The oligonucleotides of the six subgenomic RNAs, RNAs 2-7, are contained in the virion RNA. They are therefore of the same polarity as the virion RNA. Oligonucleotide fingerprints of these FIG. 8 . Oligonucleotide fingerprints of JHMV-specific RNA. JHMV virion (panel V) and intracellular RNAs (panels 1-7) were purified as described under Materials and Methods. The purified RNAs were digested with RNAse Ti, the oligonucleotides separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis, and autoradiographs prepared. The positions of the bromphenol dye marker are shown by asterisks. Unique spots are indicated by arrows. RNAs show them to make up a nested set in which any RNA contains the sequences present in any other smaller RNA plus additional sequences consistent with its larger size. Similar data have been obtained with another coronavirus, IBV (Stern and Kennedy, 1980a) . A \"Northern blot\" analysis using representative and short 3' specific cDNA probes indicates that the six subgenomic RNAs share sequences at their 3' ends (Weiss and Leibowitz, in press ). Furthermore, Stern and Kennedy (1980b) have established a 5' to 3' oligonucleotide spot order for the IBV genome. Their data show that the IBV subgenomic RNAs form a nested set with common 3' ends. Taken together, these data suggest that the MHV-specific subgenomic RNAs map from the 3' end of the genome in a similar manner to IBV. A possible model of this arrangement is shown in Fig. 9 . It is unlikely that any of the six subgenomic RNAs are defective interfering RNAs. The stock virus used in these experiments was 3 passages (A59V) or 4 passages (JHMV) removed from cloning by limiting dilution (Robb and Bond, 1979b) . The low m.o.i. used to grow virus stocks (10m4 PFU/cell) and to initiate infections in these experiments (0.1-0.15 PFU/cell) selects against the generation of defective interfering particles. Furthermore, after 10 serial undiluted passages of A59V and JHMV in 17CL. 1 cells, the RNA gel pattern observed is unchanged from early passage virus (Leibowitz, unpublished data) .",

            "text": "The six subgenomic RNAs are almost certainly mRNAs. They are polyadenylated, as expected of mRNAs, and Robb and Bond (1979) have shown that multiple MHV-specific RNA species spanning the size range of the subgenomic RNAs 2-7 are present on polysomes of infected cells. Furthermore, Siddell et al. (1980) have recently demonstrated that polyadenylated RNA isolated from JHMV-infected cells can be translated in vitro. Using sucrose gradients they were able to partially resolve 1'7 and 19 S JHMV-specific RNA species. Their in vitro translation studies suggest that the 17 S RNA codes for the 60,000-dalton virion nucleocapsid protein (Sturman, 1977; Wege et al., 1979) , while the 19 S RNA codes for the 23,000-dalton virion glycoprotein (Sturman, 1977; Wege et al., 1979) . The relatively large amounts of these two RNAs and their sedimentation properties suggest that they correspond to RNAs 6 and 7. This has recently been confirmed by the in vitro translation of gel purified RNA (Leibowitz and Weiss, in press ; van der Zeijst, in press). Van der Zeijst has also demonstrated that RNA3 codes for the 150,000-dalton protein described by Bond et al. (1979) . This protein is the intracellular counterpart to the peplomer protein described by Sturman (1977) and Sturman and Holmes (1977) . Of the five nonstructural proteins described by Bond et al. (1979) , the 57,000-and 54,000-dalton proteins have been shown to have similar tryptic maps to the nucleocapsid protein (Leibowitz, unpublished data) and are presumably translated from the same mRNA. This leaves the three other nonstructural proteins described by Bond et al. (1979) and possibly a fourth nonstructural protein which has been described by Siddell et al. (1979) to be assigned to RNAs 2, 4, and 5. The in vitro translation of all the MHV-specific RNA species and appropriate characterization of the resulting products will be required for completion of these coding assignments.",

The second mechanism, again, involves the synthesis of a full length negative strand copy of the genome. This is then transcribed to a full length positive strand RNA. The subgenomic RNAs are then derived by nucleolytic cleavage of this full length positive strand RNA. In the third model, the subgenomic RNAs are each transcribed from subgenomic negative strand templates. These templates could originate by nucleolytic cleavage of genome length negative strand RNA or by internal termination of transcription. We have been unable to demonstrate any RNase-resistant, and therefore presumably double-stranded, RNAs in infected cells. Present data are not sufficient to distinguish between these three models or a combination of them. Further experiments using ultraviolet mapping of transcription initiation sites and the use of positive strand probes to identify negative strand templates may elucidate the mechanism of transcription of coronavirus-specific RNA.",
