Surveillance is defined as: the epidemiological study of a disease as a dynamic process involving the ecology of the infectious agent, the host, the reservoirs, the vectors as well as the complex mechanisms concerned in the spread of infection and the extent to which this spread will occur.

Although particularly appropriate to the study of infectious diseases, epidemiological principles are also used to elucidate the causes of non-communicable diseases. the Registrar General that dealt with infectious diseases, occupational diseases, accidents or hazardous work conditions. The importance of keen observation of disease in order to deduce the likely cause has been demonstrated on many occasions. In 1849, 34 years before the identification of Vibrio cholerae by Robert Koch , John Snow (1813-1858), a London physician, proved by epidemiological observation that cholera was mainly spread by drinking infected water and not through the air in the form of miasmas, as was commonly thought at the time. Similarly, William Budd (1811-1880), a general practitioner from Devon, showed in 1873 how typhoid was spread, even though it was not until 1885 that the typhoid bacillus was first isolated in the laboratory. More recently, William Pickles (1885-1969), a general practitioner in Wensleydale, Yorkshire, was able to elucidate many of the epidemiological characteristics of hepatitis and other infections well before microbiological advances were to confirm his observations. From these beginnings the surveillance of infection has assumed national and international proportions. National surveillance is carried out in different countries, for example at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, USA. In the UK, information on infectious diseases and environmental hazards is collated for each devolved of the infectious agent or if the person is infected via an unusual portal of entry; it may also be impaired by immunosuppressive drug therapy, concurrent disease or the ageing process. These properties were particularly evident in the influenza H1N1 pandemic of 2009 when infection was mainly seen in younger persons as those over the age of 60 had acquired immunity from previous exposure.",

A further variable is the dose of the organism, as well as virulence. A small number of organisms of high virulence is usually sufficient to cause disease in a susceptible person, whereas if the organism is of low virulence it often fails to cause disease. Another variable is the portal of entry. Many organisms have a predilection for a particular tissue or organ. For example, the causal organism of typhoid fever, Salmonella typhi, usually causes disease only when it enters the human body through the mouth in food or water (see Ch. 24).",

The increased interest of an investigator or a change in the mechanism of reporting can sometimes result in an increase in the number of reports of illness. It is important to check the previous level of investigation of a clinical entity or alteration in laboratory methods. 3. Establish the extent of an outbreak. Often the number of cases notified is only a proportion of the total number of those affected. It is necessary to seek out the additional cases or vital information may be lost. 4. Identify common characteristics or experiences of the affected persons. An individual history from each confirmed or suspected case is required to detect any common factor among those affected (e.g. eating the same item of food). 5. Investigate the source and vehicle of infection. In addition to ascertaining the general characteristics of the material suspected as being the source or vehicle of infection, appropriate laboratory investigation will often have to be done. Good co-operation with laboratory staff is vitally important. Increasingly, putative links between individuals who present with the same infection or infectious disease are confirmed or dispelled through the typing or sequencing of the genes of the organism involved. 6. Analyse the findings. The data should be analysed by various epidemiological criteria, especially persons, time and place. Denominators should be obtained to calculate attack rates. 7. Construct and test a hypothesis. On the basis of the evidence a hypothesis should be constructed concerning the origin of the outbreak.

Indeed, the spread of the coronavirus, the air-borne infection responsible for SARS, throughout regions of the Far East (China, Vietnam and Singapore) and North America (Toronto), before it was brought under control, demonstrates how effectively inter national travel and overcrowding in major cities can facilitate the transmission of serious air-borne infections.",

If the association is limited to a specific group of persons, with a specific type of illness, who have all been subjected to the same specific infection, then a cause-and-effect relationship can be more strongly suspected. 4. Temporality. This can be of especial importance when persons in particular occupations become infected (e.g. leptospirosis in sewerworkers). The history of working in a particular environment before infection rather than vice versa is particularly relevant. 5. Biological gradient.

The likelihood of veterinary surgeons becoming ill with a zoonotic infection from affected cattle which they have recently been treating seems biologically plausible. 7. Coherence. If all the evidence is coherent (e.g. if the same micro-organism is isolated from the index case, the vehicle of transmission and from the victims), this is strong support for causation. 8.

The beneficial effects of the pasteurization of milk to diminish the number of cases of milk-borne salmonellosis is presumptive evidence of a zoonotic relationship. 9. Analogy.

The organism must always be found in the given disease. 2. The organism must be isolated in pure culture. 3. The organism must reproduce the given disease after inoculation of a pure culture into a susceptible animal. 4. The organism must be recoverable from the animal so inoculated.For many organisms pathogenic to man it is not possible to fulfil all of Koch's postulates; moreover, they are not applicable to the study of the transmission of infection within a population. For this purpose it is more appropriate to consider the following factors, suggested by the medical statistician Bradford Hill, to establish whether a disease is caused by a particular infectious agent:1. Strength. What is the strength of the association? During the cholera epidemic in London in 1854, John Snow compared the death rates among persons drinking the sewage-polluted drinking water of the Southwark and Vauxhall Company with those receiving the purer water of the Lambeth Company; he discovered that the rate in the former was 14 times greater (Table 68 .2).

The microbiologist, the clinician, the epidemiologist, the infection control nurse, the veterinarian, the environmental health officer, and other appropriate personnel, must all be involved; the extent of the involvement will depend on the nature of the infection. Success will depend on the expertise and co-operation of these members of the team.",
