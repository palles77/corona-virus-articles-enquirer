Objectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate a multiplex molecular real-time assay for the routine diagnosis of respiratory viruses, to analyze the symptoms associated with the pathogens detected and to determine the spread of virus during the period. Study design: Respiratory samples were collected from children presenting with respiratory symptoms and attending the emergency unit during the 2010-2011 winter seasons. Samples were tested with the multiplex RespiFinder \u00ae 15 assay (PathoFinder TM ) which potentially detects 15 viruses. Results: 857 (88.7%) of the 966 samples collected from 914 children were positive for one (683 samples) or multiple viruses (174 samples). The most prevalent were the respiratory syncytial virus (39.5%) and the rhinovirus (24.4%). Influenza viruses were detected in 139 (14.4%) samples. Adenovirus was detected in 93 (9.6%) samples, coronaviruses in 88 (9.1%), metapneumovirus in 51 (5.3%) and parainfluenzae in 47 (4.9%). Rhinovirus (40%) was the most prevalent pathogen in upper respiratory tract infections while respiratory syncytial virus (49.9%) was the most prevalent in lower respiratory tract infections. Co-infections were associated with severe respiratory symptoms. Conclusion: The multiplex assay detected clinically important viruses in a single genomic test and thus will be useful for detecting several viruses causing respiratory tract disorders.",

ADV, CoV, MPV and PiV also accounted for lower respiratory tract ARIs as shown previously: ADV infection was shown to lead to severe chronic disease and to the increase in the mortality rate in children [14] , whereas CoV [15] , MPV [16] and PiV [17] can be responsible for severe lower respiratory tract infections requiring hospitalization, especially among the youngest. Flu and flu syndromes were preferentially linked to influenza viruses and older children seemed to be more susceptible to these viruses.

This was exactly the case for our children: all the viruses in the panel were detected in co-infections, not only RSV, but also ADV and CoVs. Martin et al. [21] described similar results. They detected ADV in association with other viruses in 52% of samples and CoV in 50%. They also showed that multiple virus infections were correlated with less severe disease. The relationship between co-infections and illness severity remains uncertain and may depend upon the virus detected. Dual infections involving RSV and RV [22] or RSV and MPV can lead to severe bronchiolitis [23] whereas co-infections without RSV do not [24] . We also analyzed the way viral infections spread during the winter. RSV and IV were epidemic while the frequency of the other viruses changed little. Our study carried out in the winter following the influenza AH1N1pdm09 pandemia shows that IV and RV infections had returned to their pattern. This has also been described in Germany by Gr\u00f6ndahl et al. [25] who showed that the AH1N1pdm09 outbreak had a great impact on the spread of other respiratory viruses, but that the virus infections had return to their usual epidemiologic characteristics the year after.",

It is also much simpler than conventional routine techniques, which need many and various steps and a wide range of technical competence (culture, PCR, immunofluorescence). While multiplex assays are more expensive than monoplex PCRs, laboratories can still choose to perform single PCRs in a strategic stepwise fashion. This strategy may appear to be less expensive but it needs regular revision to take into account the spread of virus(es). Moreover, if several monoplex PCRs are needed, this then can become more expensive than multiplex PCRs. It must also be remembered that diagnosis of co-infections is more uncertain due to a smaller number of viruses tested.",

The most prevalent pathogen was RSV, detected in 382/966 samples (39.5%) of which 219/382 (57.3%) were type A. Three samples contained both A and B. RV was detected in 236/966 (24.4%) samples and IV in 139/966 (14.4%) samples which were mainly type A (95/139 samples; 68.3%). A subsample of 37 IVA-positive samples was subtyped: 33/37 (89.2%) were influenza AH1N1pdm09, the others were seasonal H3N2 IV. CoV NL63, OC43 and 229E in 67, 16 and 5 samples respectively). MPV were detected in 51 samples (5.3%) and PiV in 47 (4.9%) samples (type 1 in 7 (14.9%) samples, type 2 in 3 (6.4%) samples, type 3 in 19 (40.4%) samples and type 4 in 18 (38.3%) samples). More than one virus was detected in 174 (18%) samples. Of the multiple infections, 32.6% involved rhinovirus, 25.3% RSV, 26.9% IV, 48.4% ADV, 14% MPV, 57.1% CoV and 37% PIV. Two viruses were involved in 162 (16.8%) samples(Table 1), three viruses in 10 samples (1%) and four viruses in 2 samples (0.2%).4.3. Viruses detected in upper respiratory infections185/243 (76.1%) samples collected among children with upper respiratory tract infections were positive. RV was the virus most frequently detected in 74/185 (40%) samples, followed by RSV in 49/185 (26.5%) samples(Fig. 2a).4.4. Viruses detected in lower respiratory infections672/723 (92.9%) samples collected among children with lower respiratory tract infections were positive. RSV was the most frequently detected in 335/672 (49.9%) samples. 195/335 (58.2%) were type A while 139/335 (41.5%) were type B. The second most involved virus was RV in 162/672 (24.1%) samples(Fig. 2b).Viruses were detected in 336/360 (93.3%) samples collected among children with bronchiolitis and in 96/112 (85.7%) samples collected among children with pneumonia, RSV being the most frequently detected. Almost all cases of acute asthma (80/85; 94.1%) were positive for at least one virus, with RV being the most frequent.The 156 patients suffering from flu or a flu-like syndrome provided 166 samples, of these 106 (64.6%) were IV positive (69 IVA and 37 IVB). Thirty of the 758 remaining patients were IV positive",
