Restricted water intake and activity also impair adequate processing of dietary fiber and promote stasis. In addition to reducing intake, chronic stress causes increased catecholamine signaling, acting on the enteric nervous system to impair intestinal motility. Once initiated, dysmotility leads to reduced colonic transit, with decreased fecal output, increased dehydration of intestinal contents, dehydration of gastric contents with trichobezoar formation, impaired cecal fermentation, and disruption of the enteric microflora, creating a cycle of further anorexia and worsening stasis. 12, 13 In severe cases, stasis leads to partial or complete obstruction or accumulation of gas within the GI tract (bloat) that can be a life-threatening emergency (discussed later). Clinical signs of GI stasis can include decreased or absent fecal material, anorexia, bruxism, pain with abdominal palpation, decreased GI sounds, dehydration, abdominal distension, gastric tympany, and respiratory or cardiovascular compromise. 14 Severely ill rabbits progress to hypovolemic shock with reduced blood pressure and altered mentation.",

            "text": "Diagnosis requires a thorough history, physical examination, and abdominal imaging (radiographs and/or ultrasound). Radiographic studies of the abdomen in 2 views are essential for examining gastric contents, colonic fecal contents, and, most importantly, severe gas/fluid accumulation suggestive of obstruction, which constitutes a surgical emergency. 15 Trichobezoars are an uncommon cause of stasis in guinea pigs but also require surgical intervention. 16 Laboratory studies (complete blood cell count, biochemistry, and urinalysis) can be helpful for determination of an underlying cause of anorexia, but most have only nonspecific findings of dehydration or possibly elevated hepatic enzymes from developing hepatic lipidosis. 17 Routine GI stasis is treated with comprehensive supportive care (aggressive fluid hydration, pain management, and assisted nutrition) best performed in a hospital setting for close monitoring. Animals should be kept warm in a dark, quiet place to minimize stress. Fluid replacement is achieved with warmed fluids (25-35 mL/kg every 8 hours) and can be given orally or subcutaneously [SC] ), although animals with severe dehydration require more aggressive intravenous (IV) fluids. Anxiety can be minimized with injectable midazolam (0.25-0.5 mg/kg IV/intramuscular [IM] ) and pain controlled with analgesics, such as buprenorphine (0.01-0.05 mg/kg, IM or SC every 4-6 hours), which can later be transitioned to meloxicam after adequate hydration (0.2 mg/kg IM/ SC/by mouth every 24 hours in guinea pigs and 0.2-1 mg/kg IM/SC/by mouth every 24 hours in rabbits). Once obstruction has been ruled out, prokinetic agents, including metoclopramide (0.5 mg/kg SC/by mouth every 8-12 hours) and/or cisapride (0.5 mg/kg by mouth every 8-12 hours) can be used. Simethicone (20 mg/kg by mouth every 8-12 hours) can be used to reduce gas distension and ranitidine (2 mg/kg IV every 24 hours, 2-5 mg/kg by mouth every 12 hours) used in cases with prolonged anorexia where gastric ulceration is likely. Nutritional support is essential and can be performed by syringe feeding (15 mL/kg every 8 hours) of an herbivore critical care formulation. Prolonged nutritional support can be provided by nasogastric tube. Antibiotics should only be used in cases complicated by enterotoxemia and bacterial enteritis. [17] [18] [19] Dysbiosis and Antibiotic-associated Enterotoxemia Diarrheal disease is common and frequently results from alterations in the intestinal microflora balance, 20 or dysbiosis, ranging from mild changes causing soft stools, to pathogenic bacterial overgrowth with more significant enteritis, to life-threatening enterotoxemia. The gut flora is sensitive to any type of environmental change. Frequent causes of dysbiosis include poor diet, hypomotility, stress, toxins, and antibiotic use. Low-fiber, high-carbohydrate diets are the primary risk factor for several reasons: (1) formation of dense masses that prohibit adequate digestion and sterilization by the low pH gastric juice and enzymes; (2) reduced hindgut motility (discussed previously), delaying clearance of luminal bacteria and fermentation byproducts, causing an altered cecal pH and fermentation environment that favors the growth of pathogenic species; and (3) carbohydrate-rich diets that provide a readily available source of luminal glucose for opportunistic organisms, such as Escherichia coli and Clostridium spp. 12, 21 Systemic illness and stress, also acting to reduce motility, can precipitate dysbiosis. Indiscriminate antibiotic use, particularly with narrow-spectrum agents that selectively target beneficial gram-positive bacteria (penicillins, amoxicillin AE clavulanic acid, cephalosporins, ampicillin, clindamycin, and lincomycin), creates optimal conditions for overgrowth of pathogenic species. Chloramphenicol, trimethoprim/ sulfas, and fluoroquinolones are least likely to damage the microflora, and there is a decreased risk with parenteral versus oral administration. 14, 22 Overgrowth of C spiroforme in rabbits causes an often-fatal enterotoxemia due to elaboration of bacterial toxin. Although adults with dysbiosis can develop enterotoxemia, weanlings are most susceptible due to their poorly established flora and high gastric pH. Newborns can also develop toxemia from toxin secreted into the milk of infected mothers. 12 Recently, it has been demonstrated that C spiroforme toxin (binary actin-ADP-ribosylating, iota-like toxin) gains access to enterocytes via the lipolysisstimulated lipoprotein receptor, which is also used by the C difficile transferase and C perfringes iota toxins, causing a secretory diarrhea. 23, 24 In acute infections, rabbits develop watery diarrhea, possibly with blood, that soils the perineum and legs. They become anorexic and decline over 2 to 4 days into a moribund state with hypovolemic shock, leading to death. On necropsy, the cecum, the primary reservoir for bacterial growth, is often covered with petechial and ecchymotic hemorrhage that can spread into the appendix and proximal colon. The mucosa can also contain hemorrhage, thick mucus, gas, or pseudomembranes. 25 In young rabbits (7-14 weeks of age), bacterial dysbiosis and resultant cecal hyperacidity can lead to the proliferation of enteric goblet cells with voluminous mucus production, causing a mucoid enteritis. 26 Although the exact cause is unclear, the disease is predominantly found in intense breeding colonies and is uncommon in pet rabbits. Affected animals have anorexia and develop lethargy, weight loss, and cecal impaction. 25 Clinical symptoms of antibiotic associated enterotoxemia begin 1 to 5 days after antibiotic administration, and include anorexia, dehydration, and hypothermia; diarrhea may or may not be present. Diagnosis is based on clinical history and clinical signs and can be confirmed with polymerase chain reaction or ELISA-based commercial tests for C difficile toxin. Treatment of dysbiosis/enteritis/enterotoxemia involves aggressive supportive care and correction of hypomotility. Correction of dehydration and nutritional deficiencies are critical, as is providing a warm, safe environment with adequate analgesia. For cases of enteritis caused by bacterial overgrowth, fecal bacterial culture and sensitivity can be helpful to guide antiobiotic therapy with broad-spectrum agents, including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (30 mg/kg by mouth every 12 hours) or enrofloxacin (15 mg/kg by mouth every 24 hours). For enterotoxemia, a dual approach of metronidazole (20 mg/kg every 12 hours) and cholestyramine (2 g/20 mL water every 24 hours by gavage) can be used to treat Clostridium infection and bind its toxin, although C spiroforme has widespread intrinsic and acquired antimicrobial resistance. 27, 28 Chloramphenicol (50 mg/kg by mouth every 8 hours) can be used to attempt to suppress Clostridial overgrowth. 14, 22 Preventing dysbiosis with a high-fiber diet and reducing stress is key to prevention. Attempts to correct the dysbiosis have anecdotal success, including transfaunation and commercial probiotics containing Lactobacillus spp, although controlled studies to document their utility are lacking. 29 Exterotoxemia is best avoided by judicious antibiotic use in guinea pigs and rabbits.",

A needle used as a trocar can be passed percutaneously, although this carries a risk of gastric or cecal rupture or peritonitis. If GDV is suspected, emergent surgical intervention is required to reduce the volvulus. After surgical intervention, medical management per GI stasis is used. Simethicone can be used to enhance gas absorption but only after aggressive hydration to avoid a potential foreign body from dehydrated simethicone. 18 ",

            "text": "Although dietary factors (low fiber and excess carbohydrates) can cause soft stools in all guinea pigs, diarrhea from bacterial enteritis is usually seen in weanlings, pregnant sows, and immunocompromised/chronically stressed adults. The most common cause is C piliforme (Tyzzer disease), transmitted by fecal-oral route. Infected animals progress rapidly from onset of lethargy, anorexia, and diarrhea to acute death. Antemortem diagnosis is generally not possible because C piliforme is an intracellular bacterium that does not grow in culture. At necropsy, infections are marked by intestinal inflammation Fig. 1 .

The owners declined emergency surgery and this guinea pig died within 3 hours of instituting supportive care measures. and patchy hepatic necrosis. Treatment has not proved beneficial, and prevention is best achieved by good husbandry and stress reduction, especially during weaning. 14, 34 Salmonellosis from S typhimurium and S enteritidis are less-frequent causes of bacterial enteritis but are highly lethal with greater than 50% mortality. Transmission is generally from contaminated food or water, although fecal transmission also occurs. Infected animals exhibit anorexia, weight loss, light-colored feces with or without diarrhea, weakness, depression, and poor grooming. Infected pregnant sows have a high incidence of abortion. Physical examination frequently reveals hepatosplenomegaly (with punctate necrotic foci in the viscera at necropsy) and conjunctivitis. Salmonella can be cultured from the feces. Because infected animals can become asymptomatic carriers of this zoonotic disease, treatment is not recommended. Preventive measures include thorough disinfection of the environment and proper storage and washing of all fresh fruits and vegetables offered. 14, 35 Other causes of bacterial enteritis include Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, E coli, C perfringes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter freundii, Listeria monocytogenes, and Lawsonia intracellularis. Y pseudotuberculosis can cause distinct clinical presentations: an acute, rapidly fatal (28-48 h) septicemic form; a chronic diarrheal disease with wasting and death within weeks; and a nonfatal infection marked by abscesses of the head and neck lymph nodes. Y pseudotuberculosis can also cause abscess formation in the ileum, cecum, mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, and omentum. Treatment is not advised, because it can induce an asymptomatic carrier state and promote zoonotic transmission. 22 ,35 E coli infection/overgrowth is particularly virulent in weanlings and is marked by anorexia, diarrhea, depression, wasting, and death. At necropsy, yellow fluid and gas are found in the intestines, and there is often focal hepatic necrosis. 35 L intracellularis is most often found in swine but can also infect rodents, including guinea pigs. The intracellular organism infects enteric epithelial cells, causing a proliferative enteropathy marked by diarrhea, wasting, and eventual death. 36 Parasitic disease GI helminth infections are predominately due to the guinea pig roundworm, Paraspidodera uncinata. The nematode develops and resides in the cecum and colon but does not invade the mucosa. Typical oxyurid eggs are shed in the feces, and ingestion leads to infection within 3 to 5 days. Infections are often mild and subclinical, although heavy infections lead to anorexia, diarrhea, weight loss, and poor coat. Treatment is with ivermectin (0.2 mg/kg SC) and prevention by effective sanitation. 22, 34 Cryptosporidium wrairi is a protozoan that targets the small intestine epithelial brush border. Transmission is by ingestion of oocysts from infected food, water, and fomites. Infections are marked by diarrhea, weight loss, rectal prolapse, potbellied appearance, and a greasy coat. Although immunocompetent animals generally recover within 4 weeks and develop resistance, weanlings, juveniles, and immunosuppressed animals often have a more severe course with mortality approaching 50%. Oocysts can be diagnosed on fecal examination, and organisms may be seen on histopathology. Oocysts can be destroyed with 5% ammonia or extremes of temperature. Cryptosporiodosis is potentially zoonotic.",

The link between stress and ulcers can be experimentally demonstrated in rabbits by intraperitoneal injections of epinephrine, because rabbits serve as a model organism for ulcers. 41 Similarly, hypovolemic shock can induce gastric ulcers in rabbits in a matter of hours. 42 In Hinton's review, 2% of the rabbits had solitary peptic ulcers, the majority of which were perforated and found in females dying in the peripartum period. 40 Rabbits with gastric ulcers frequently present with anorexia and evidence of pain, such as bruxism.

Rarely, papillomas occur elsewhere in the mouth, and there is 1 report of a concomitant conjunctival papilloma. 47 Papillomas start as small millimeter-sized sessile lesions and can grow into larger (3-5 mm) clusters of pedunculated papules. The lesions are benign and can persist for as long as 145 days. 48 Rabbit enteric coronavirus The virus was discovered as a cause of rapidly fatal enteritis in young (3-10 weeks) laboratory rabbits. 49 Infected rabbits develop lethargy, diarrhea, abdominal swelling, pleural effusion, and cardiomyopathy and invariably die within 24 hours. At necropsy, the intestine is fluid-filled and the villi are effaced. The virus has hemagglutination activity and can be detected in the feces. A divergent coronavirus strain has recently been identified in game rabbits in Asia. 50 Rotavirus Rotavirus is highly infectious with a high morbidity and variable (generally low) mortality. Weanling rabbits (2-4 months) are most susceptible, and disease severity is increased with coinfection with another enteric pathogen. 51 Antibodies to rotavirus are found in laboratory, commercial, and pet rabbits, indicating it can infect most strains. 52 Infection impairs the sodium solute pumps on the enterocyte surface, impairing reabsorption. 53 Rotavirus infections are marked by anorexia, dehydration, and green-yellow watery diarrhea. The intestines become distended and congested, with petechial hemorrhages, chronic inflammation, and villous atrophy. Diagnosis requires virus identification, and treatment is with supportive care.",

The disease occurs in rabbits over 2 months of age, in part due to its binding to the histo-blood group antigens H, A, and B type 2 oligosaccharides, which are present on the surface of mature respiratory and intestinal epithelial cells. 55 The virus replicates in the liver, causing severe hepatic necrosis and eventual death from disseminated intravascular coagulation. The clinical presentation and course varies from a peracute disease lasting only 12 to 36 hours, followed by sudden death, to an acute or subacute febrile illness with anorexia, diarrhea (or constipation), neurologic, and other systemic symptoms, lasting a few days to weeks, to a persistent/latent disease with continued virus shedding.",

Subclinical infection is common, and disease severity varies with age (worse under 6 months), species of Eimeria, parasite burden, and condition of the rabbit (stress, poor husbandry, and poor diet). Significant disease is marked by diarrhea with possible mucus or blood, dehydration, and weight loss. Intussusception is a complication of severe disease. Diagnosis depends on histopathology and/or fecal identification. Molecular assays have been developed to identify intestinal Eimeria spp. 57 In addition to supportive care, sulfa drugs are most effective at limiting multiplication. Sulfadimethoxine (15 mg/kg by mouth every 12 hours) or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole (30 mg/kg by mouth every 12 hours) can be used for 10 days of therapy. Recovering rabbits develop lifelong immunity. 12 Cryptosporidiosis Cryptosporidium parvum infects the small intestine and causes a self-limited diarrheal illness (4-5 days duration) in young rabbits (peak, 30-40 days old). Illness is accompanied by anorexia, depression, and dehydration. The organism can be identified on histopathology. Other than supportive care, there is no effective treatment. Recently, reports of rabbit Cryptosporidium spp causing zoonotic disease in humans have been reported in several countries. 58 Nematodes Passalurus ambiguous, the rabbit pinworm, is found in most rabbits, and even large parasite burdens are not pathogenic. Adult worms reside in the cecum and colon, and transmission is direct by ingestion of eggs during cecotrophy. Diagnosis is often routine by identification of worms or eggs in the feces, although identification should not prompt treatment in most cases. When treatment is necessary, benzimidazoles, such as fenbendazole (10-20 mg/kg by mouth, repeated in 10-14 days), are effective. 12 ",
