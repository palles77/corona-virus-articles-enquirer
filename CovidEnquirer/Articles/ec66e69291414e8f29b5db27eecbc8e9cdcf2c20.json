            "text": "Positive-stranded viruses synthesize their RNA in membrane-bound organelles, but it is not clear how this benefits the virus or the host. For coronaviruses, these organelles take the form of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) interconnected by a convoluted membrane network. We used electron microscopy to identify murine coronaviruses with mutations in nsp3 and nsp14 that replicated normally while producing only half the normal amount of DMVs under low-temperature growth conditions. Viruses with mutations in nsp5 and nsp16 produced small DMVs but also replicated normally. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) confirmed that the most strongly affected of these, the nsp3 mutant, produced more viral RNA than wild-type virus. Competitive growth assays were carried out in both continuous and primary cells to better understand the contribution of DMVs to viral fitness. Surprisingly, several viruses that produced fewer or smaller DMVs showed a higher fitness than wild-type virus at the reduced temperature, suggesting that larger and more numerous DMVs do not necessarily confer a competitive advantage in primary or continuous cell culture. For the first time, this directly demonstrates that replication and organelle formation may be, at least in part, studied separately during infection with positive-stranded RNA virus.",

In this study, we looked at thousands of infected cells and identified two coronavirus mutants that made half as many organelles as normal and two others that made typical numbers but smaller organelles. Despite differences in DMV size and number, all four mutants replicated as efficiently as wild-type virus. To better understand the relative importance of replicative organelles, we carried out competitive fitness experiments. None of these viruses was found to be significantly less fit than wild-type, and two were actually fitter in tests in two kinds of cells. This suggests that viruses have evolved to have tremendous plasticity in the ability to form membraneassociated replication complexes and that large and numerous DMVs are not exclusively associated with efficient coronavirus replication.",

We chose to work with ts viruses as a pool of readymade replicase point mutants that have been preselected for both robust growth at 33\u00b0C and functional importance, since each of the ts mutations is lethal at 40\u00b0C. We carried out these tests in order both to better understand the connection between organelles and viral RNA synthesis and to examine whether mutation of critical residues produces a detectable effect on the replicative organelle. To do this, we quantified virus release, DMV formation, RNA synthesis, and competitive fitness in a variety of cell types.",

To better understand the functional consequences of activating the ts phenotype of Brts105, we performed a stop/resume assay, which was designed as a simple tool to compare the severity of ts phenotypes. The assay takes advantage of the eclipse phase, during which RNA replication takes place but no new virus emerges, which lasts for 6 h after inoculation (5) . The stop/resume assay works by stopping RNA synthesis 4.5 h after inoculation, during the eclipse phase. After 3 h under stopped conditions, RNA synthesis was then either resumed for 4 h, in order to allow the release of new virus with the participation of previously synthesized components, or kept under stopped conditions (Fig. 2D ). If the resumed titer was significantly higher than the stopped titer (typically about a 10-fold increase), then the ts phenotype was classified as mild, meaning that some residual function or functional components were available after the stoppage period, but if the titer did not increase significantly after resumption, then the ts phenotype was classified as severe.",

Genomic and subgenomic RNA 7 synthesis was quantified using primers specific to the nsp3-encoding region and across the leader-body junction of subgenomic RNA 7, respectively. Brts31 synthesized somewhat larger amounts of genomic and sub- genomic RNA than the wild type at 33\u00b0C, as shown in Fig. 4B . Together, these data demonstrate that efficient RNA production is not necessarily correlated with large or numerous DMVs. DMVs and fitness. To better understand the role of DMV formation in the virus replication cycle, we carried out competitive fitness assays on all the viruses that grew to approximately wildtype titers. In these assays, an equal number of plaque-forming units of wild-type virus and one ts virus were added at low multiplicity to either continuous or primary cells, which were then incubated at 33\u00b0C. Fitness was calculated as the ratio of mutant virus to wild-type virus present in the supernatant at the end of the competition. In this assay, a ratio of 1 would indicate that the viruses were equally fit, higher ratios indicate that the mutant virus is fitter than the wild type, and lower ratios indicate that the mutant virus is less fit than the wild type. Viruses were differentiated by means of plaque assays initiated at 33\u00b0C for 1 h and then continued by incubation at either 40\u00b0C (where only the wild type forms plaques) or 33\u00b0C (where both viruses form plaques). The assay was validated by performing differential plaque assays on pure samples of the wild type and Brts105 (Fig. 5A ). The number of plaques formed by the wild type did not differ significantly at the two temperatures. Brts105 formed plaques in 33\u00b0C plaque assays but not in plaque assays initiated at 33\u00b0C and then continued by incubation at 40\u00b0C (Fig. 5A ). This demonstrated that titers of wild-type and ts viruses can be distinguished by differential plaque assays and that the reversion rate of Brts105 was less than 10 \u03ea5 and therefore would not detectably complicate the interpretation of competition experiments, which typically produced more than 10 6 PFU/ml.",

However, other studies have shown that replicative organelles disappear within about 2 h of treatments that strongly inhibit viral RNA synthesis (14, 15) . In this study, we documented viruses with a range of organelle sizes and prevalence that were sufficient to support wild-type levels of viral growth. This included two viruses of the six tested (Brts31 and Brts105) that replicated normally with half the normal complement of organelles or less. These results extend findings that attenuated nsp4 mutant viruses produce fewer organelles than normal (21) .

This finding was anticipated by a recent study that demonstrated that subcellular compartments that contain double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) (i.e., probable DMVs) were not necessarily sites of active RNA replication (38) . We unexpectedly found that viruses that produced larger and more numerous DMVs did not have a consistent fitness advantage in primary or continuous cells under test conditions. However, it is quite possible that further testing in primary macrophages or live animals would reveal a competitive advantage for increased organelle numbers or increased DMV capacity. A previous analysis of coronavirus RNA replication had shown that viral dsRNA colocalizes well with nonstructural proteins early in infection but that the correlation becomes less clear over time (38) . Nevertheless, these results are the first direct evidence to our knowledge that intracellular RNA synthesis can be at least partially decoupled from formation of replicative organelles. We also report here for the first time that viruses with mutations in all 5 known cistrons of the MHV replicase form either slightly or substantially smaller DMVs, suggesting that while DMVs are formed primarily by nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6 mutants (17), mutations in any part of the replicase locus can potentially restrict DMV formation. This suggests that the size and potentially the form of the replicative organelle may be dependent on factors other than the amount of RNA synthesis, such as the efficiency of polyprotein processing.",

The results presented here should be taken with two caveats: that the effects of the mutations may be indirect, and that comparisons of growth and competition could be performed only at reduced temperature. Although all ts viruses except for Albts22 matched the output of the wild type at reduced temperature, reduced temperature may affect replication and the processes that lead to DMV formation differently.",

However, we could not find a simple explanation for finding that the Brts105 mutation in nsp14, located over 15,000 nucleotides (nt) downstream of the Brts31 mutation, in a domain which had not previously been shown to be essential for DMV synthesis, also reduced organelle formation. While it is possible that the N7 methyltransferase activity of nsp14 is involved in an early step of DMV formation, a more likely explanation is that the mutation alters long-range protein folding or protein processing that occurs upstream of DMV formation, as observed previously for mutations in nsp10 and nsp3 (14, 27) . However, further work will be needed to study the effects of the Brts105 mutation on the function of other essential replicase proteins such as nsp5 (14, 27) or protein complexes such as the nsp10-nsp14-nsp16 RNA cap methylation complex (43) . Notwithstanding, the results presented here constitute the first demonstration of a functional linkage between nsp14 and the DMV scaffold proteins.",
