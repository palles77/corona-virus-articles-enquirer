Comparison of surveillance data on specific topics [1, 2] have provided insight into the impact of different safety strategies, but comparison of different countries' approaches to surveillance and risk assessment has received little attention in the literature. Comparison can provide insight into defining the core characteristics of a transmissible infection surveillance program as well as describe the potential for diversity and adaptation. Furthermore, as surveillance analyses are used extensively for blood services' internal purposes, the breadth of research activities is not well represented in the literature, thus making comparison of programs incomplete without an inside view.",

In 1989, the Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study (REDS) was established with funding from the National Institutes of Health [3] . This study group collected donor data from 6 different blood centers into a single database for analysis facilitated by an independent research center and conducted safety-related studies and donor surveys. Merging data from different computer systems required an elaborate encryption procedure to maintain the anonymity of donors while permitting donations from the same donor to be identified and tracked. However, because it did not include all US donors, it could not identify any unusual trends in centers not involved in the study, and although the centers were geographically diverse, they were not randomly selected and were not necessarily representative of the US blood supply. The largest blood supplier, the ARC, maintains an epidemiology and surveillance department within their research and development division, providing a larger database for transmissible infection surveillance that is now generally considered to be representative of national trends with every donation made to the ARC since 1995, although it has some of the same limitations. Blood Systems, another large blood supplier that has multiple blood collection centers in several US states and is a member of ABC, also has an active epidemiology and surveillance department.",

These blood services were intended to function at arms length from the government to ensure their independence and a clear line of responsibility for the safety of the blood supply. Approximately three quarters of Canada's blood supply is collected and distributed by Canadian Blood Services (CBS) in 9 provinces and 3 territories, with one quarter collected and distributed by H\u00e9ma-Qu\u00e9bec (HQ) in the province of Qu\u00e9bec.",

First, confidentiality of donor data is highly protected in some countries; second, information technology issues can make combining of data challenging; and third, cost can be an impediment. Producing national surveillance data has required creative solutions from countries with more than 1 supplier, but even with these solutions, such programs are likely to produce somewhat more limited data than surveillance conducted in countries with a single national blood program. In the UK, national coordination is achieved through the largest blood supplier and the HPA, and in the United States, the newly established national Biovigilance Network is coordinated by a publicprivate partnership between a government agency (CDC) and a transfusion medicine professional association (AABB). These approaches have some limitations in the level of interpretation possible but, nevertheless, achieve the primary goal of monitoring at a national level. National blood suppliers, on the other hand, can collate all donor and transmissible disease data into a single database in real time and monitor at different demographic and geographic levels. Thus, countries with a single national blood supplier are at a substantial advantage in coordinating and analyzing national data.

Countries such as the UK and France that have a closer association with public health have easier access to public health data, better opportunity to stay current with public health planning, and have a more clearly defined portal for collaboration to address emerging pathogens. Furthermore, surveillance of blood programs parallels the interests of public health surveillance in that a large population is being tested actively (as opposed to passive reporting), and it monitors how well transfusion transmission is being prevented.

In Australia, the various states and territories have different forms of adverse event reporting and tracking and are at different stages in reporting capacity [14] .

Confirming transfusion transmission of a disease is based on a range of data, including patient symptoms indicative of a new infection, pretransfusion patient samples (negative for the marker), a positive patient sample posttransfusion, a traced donor with a positive sample, and genetic sequencing of the pathogen matching donor and recipient samples. It is rare for all of these data to be available because patient pretransfusion samples are often not available, donors are not always traced and/or willing to provide a sample, and sometimes the donor's infection has resolved before follow-up testing. Hence, transfusion transmission is usually considered probable or possible depending on the data available but is less often confirmed. In addition, as patient symptoms may be mild, may not always be attributed to infection, and patients may die because of their underlying pathology without detection of infection, it is generally considered that some infections will not be reported. Hospital reporting to blood centers of potential transfusion transmission may lack the requisite data mentioned above, preventing any conclusion as to the infectious source. Thus, there is a margin of error either way, and the frequency of TTI's may appear less than or possibly even greater than they really are. Because of these limitations, mathematical models of donor data are considered more accurate to quantify the low risks of transfusion-transmissible infections (eg, residual risk estimates).",

There has been continued effort in different countries to adapt and improve this model to address certain deficiencies and to better address their requirements. For example, in the UK, in addition to window period infections, an adjustment for product process errors and test failure [24] is used routinely, although with today's standards of automation and Good Manufacturing Practices in blood donation testing centers, testing error is an extremely rare finding. Others have revised the methodology to estimate the incidence of infection if it is otherwise unknown. For example, a mathematical adjustment [22] and, then in the United States, a method using nucleid acid testing (NAT)-yield donations (those with NATpositive results but not having yet developed antibody) were proposed [22, 32] , which was a substantial improvement for NAT-tested donations (HIV and HCV) because the estimate could now include first-time donors directly. Estimated hepatitis B incidence density is problematic because an adjustment for infections that resolve between donations (thus, not directly detected) is required, as originally proposed in the United States [33] . In France and the United States, more detailed supplemental testing was used to improve identification of such incident HBV cases [34] and to include a hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) yield method [35] . Work has also been done to address estimated residual risk in countries where the data requirements for the incidence/window period model cannot be fully addressed [21, 36] . All blood programs also carry out additional studies to understand various aspects of risk such as risk factors of seroconverting donors [37] and estimating the rate of recent infections [38] . Work to better understand risk in donors who test positive for transmissible infection and future trends is ongoing in all 5 countries in this report. Examples include assessment of trends in infections [39, 40] , assessment of the value of continuing certain testing such as syphilis testing as a surrogate marker for HIV [41] , and assessment of risk with current procedures in place such as the risk of cytomegalovirus in untested units [42, 43] .",

Before introduction, the UK estimated the expected frequency of HCV NAT-positive donations [24] ; these estimates were greater than actual in the first few years. After the implementation of NAT, the yield was evaluated in the United States [32] , Canada [19] , and Australia [20, 21] , showing small gains. To confirm the assumption that NAT yield cases were new incident infections, follow-up (seroconversion) studies in the United States and Australia showed that most donors seroconvert, although a few do not. These rare immunologically silent infections would only be identified by NAT, indicating the 2-fold value of NAT testing for incident infections as well as for these rare infections [45, 46] . In France, evaluation of HIVpositive individuals identified through donor screening with persistently low HIV RNA (without treatment) showed that, in a follow-up study, minipool NAT failed to identify nearly half of these samples, and some could not be reliably detected even by single-donation NAT. Because these people all had positive tests to the antibody, it is clear that dropping the antibody assay could result in some HIV-positive donations entering the blood supply [47] .",

Testing for HTLV, a white cell (leukocyte)associated virus, was implemented in some countries before implementing universal leukoreduction that greatly reduces the risk of transmission [2] . In the UK, where leukoreduction was introduced in 1999, a regional study suggested low prevalence (about 5/100 000 donations) [49] , and only about 6 people per year would be at the risk for developing HTLV-associated disease from transfusion. In 1996, the UK decided not to implement screening, but later, the development of pooled systems for testing made testing a more costeffective option, and it was introduced in 2002. Postimplementation evaluation indicated that the risk of an infectious donation entering the blood supply was reduced to 0.11 per million donations, and, of course, the risk of development of disease would be much less [50] . Initial analysis of HTLV lookback data suggests that leukoreduction is effective in reducing posttransfusion HTLV [51] .",

Thus, monitoring of genotypes within a country's donor population can assist in evaluating risk and can be important in selection or modification of assays and has the potential to identify mutations of viruses. Analysis of viral diversity in transmissible disease positive donors has been carried out routinely in France for more than 10 years [72] and, more recently, commenced in the United States [73] and Scotland. Studies are in the planning stage in England. In addition to the direct application to monitoring transfusion safety, genotyping permits insight into the origins of infections as different genotypes are associated with particular parts of the world.

In addition, very close communication with public health and other blood suppliers was necessary to identify risk areas quickly. In the United States, the coordination challenge was very large, with so many independent blood centers not accustomed to working together at this level. The AABB developed a Web site that allowed independent blood testing laboratories to voluntarily enter their data on donor WNV-reactive cases and later enter the associated confirmatory data. This permitted close to real-time monitoring of donor infections by geographic regions. This system, combined with networking between blood centers, facilitated communication of important data between blood centers near one another so that individual donation NAT could be triggered in adjacent and overlapping areas served by different independent blood centers.",

In both the United States and Canada, these methods are now part of routine WNV surveillance [75, 76] .

By 2007, 7 transfusion transmissions had been reported [79] (5 in the United States and 2 in Canada). This suggested that transfusion transmission was rare, but the symptoms could easily be misdiagnosed such that the true risk was difficult to ascertain. In 2007, after an ARC study showing that about 1 in 4500 donors in selected areas had T cruzi antibodies [80] , the FDA licensed the assay, and most blood operators began testing all donations for T cruzi antibody. A surveillance reporting system similar to that used for WNV was set up and coordinated by the AABB. This Webbased system relied upon voluntary reporting of data from blood testing laboratories and made publicly available a map of the United States with positive donations shown and regularly updated statistics. This provided the first national prevalence data (in donors or the general population) for T cruzi infection in the United States. In addition, studies were done along side implementation to assess the risk factors of T cruzi positive donors, and lookback studies assessed the frequency of traceable units transmitting infection. More recently, US blood operators have been shifting to selective testing policies involving donor qualification, that is, testing a donor once, and if negative, no further testing of subsequent donations is needed.",

In 1996, a new neurologic disease that is always fatal was reported in humans, new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) presumably caused by consumption of bovine spongiform encephalopathy-infected meat, and by transplantation of organs/tissues of infected donors. The UK experienced the largest epidemic of variant CJD (vCJD), with France as the next most affected, and only a few cases in other countries [83] . Although transfusion transmission was initially considered improbable, this view was reconsidered in light of experimental evidence, wider distribution of the infective agent, prions, within patients than with classical CJD, and the eventual documentation of transfusion-transmitted clinical cases.",

Reporting of suspected vCJD transmissions differs from that of other infections and relies on close working between the health protection authority (HPA), the blood services, and the National vCJD Surveillance Unit; to date, the confirmed TTI cases were from among a small group of recipients who were under active surveillance because they had received blood components from donors who later developed vCJD.

            "text": "Malaria is not endemic in any of the countries in this report, but there is an ongoing risk from imported malaria. By far, the greatest risk is from so-called semi-immune donors born or a resident in malaria-endemic countries (particularly sub-Saharan Africa and Papua New Guinea), where the dominant species is Plasmodium falciparum, the most lethal of the 5 species infecting humans. The potential risk of transfusion transmission varies with immigration policy and travel preferences of each country's population. Based on the population rate of imported malaria cases associated with travel to/residence in the World Health Organizationdefined \"high-risk\" countries, France and the UK are at greatest risk from semi-immune donors. However, because of the inclusion of very low-risk travel in different countries' assessment of \"at-risk\" donors, the percentage of donors in this classification varies from about 5% in Australia to about 3% in France and Canada to about 1% in the United States. The surveillance approach is similar in all countries (monitoring community cases and TTIs), but the policy varies with France, the UK, and Australia, applying selective testing policies to more rapidly reinstate healthy donors. These countries also therefore monitor infections in at-risk donors. The United States and Canada apply deferral criteria without the option of testing. Current testing can identify antibodies to P falciparum but not all other species with high sensitivity [86] [87] [88] , and the rare transfusion-transmitted cases of malaria identified in the UK and France relate more to failure to test rather than test failure [86, 89, 90] . In France, evaluation of 2 TTIs that occurred with selective testing in place prompted revision of the policy to reduce the risk. Postimplementation evaluation in Australia showed that testing greatly reduced the impact of deferral, with the recovery of about 8% of annual production of red blood cells and 5% of platelets [91] . Importantly, this was achieved without any apparent change in the risk of transfusion-transmitted malaria.",

However, 2 cases of delayed onset (relapsing) P vivax malaria in Australian donors highlight a previously unreported limitation of the strategy [92] . P vivax is able to sequester in the liver for months to several years before reemerging to cause clinical malaria. Importantly, antibody testing (or for that matter, any other laboratory malaria test) is unable to identify donors potentially at risk for relapse. Highlighting this, both implicated donors had tested antibody negative subsequent to their most recent travel to Papua New Guinea, a country that, along with its neighbors, carries a much greater risk for relapse. Fortunately, no components from the 2 donors were transfused, and the rarity of such makes their impact on recipient safety negligible when compared with the risk from semi-immune donors. Nonetheless, the ABS has already moved to close the gap by implementing a 3-year restriction to plasma for fractionation only (within which testing is embargoed) for donors returning from Papua New Guinea.",

In Puerto Rico, where the ARC is the largest single provider of blood, dengue is endemic year round with annual island-wide outbreaks. The Dengue Branch of the CDC located in San Juan conducts ongoing surveillance for dengue in Puerto Rico. During an outbreak in 2005, NAT using the Gen-Probe transcription-mediated amplification assay was performed retrospectively for an 11-week period to assess the frequency of donor viremia. In total, 12 donations were positive (0.73/1000 donations), and infectious virus was recovered from 3 donations that may have been able to transmit infection [96] , indicating a risk of transfusion transmission. In 2007, during a larger outbreak, higher rates of donor viremia were documented along with a transfusion-transmitted case. Management of risk has included implementing a predonation question regarding dengue-like symptoms and the use of an enhanced postdonation information sheet encouraging donors to call back if dengue-like symptoms develop. Infected donors have been deferred for 120 days from dengue diagnosis or onset of illness, whichever is later. Dengue virus NS1 Ag testing (Bio-Rad, Paris, France) was initiated in March 2010 shortly after a new outbreak for 2010 was declared. Donor screening assays targeting dengue virus RNA would be preferred but are not available because significant funding will be required for commercialization. Apart from Puerto Rico, nearly all dengue cases reported in the 48 US continental states were acquired elsewhere by travelers or immigrants. The last reported continental dengue outbreaks were in south Texas in 2005 and in Key West, Florida, in 2009 and again in 2010. Several autochthonous cases have now been reported in 2 counties in mainland Florida. A small dengue outbreak occurred in Hawaii in 2001 [97] .",

The outbreak on Reunion Island required an immediate coordinated effort on the part of the public health officials and the blood service. Red cells and plasma could be transported from continental France, but because of the shorter shelf life, platelet units still needed to be produced locally, and a pathogen reduction system was quickly implemented (in March 2006, shortly after suspending collection of red cells and plasma) [104] . A collaborative group composed of members from the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Sanitaire des Produits de Sant\u00e9 (French regulator), the EFS, and the INTS coordinated by the InVS estimated the risk of viremia in blood donations during the outbreak. Using public health surveillance data that were ramped up during the epidemic [105] and applying methodology gained from the WNV outbreak in the United States, risk estimates were made for the small outbreak in 2005. Predictions using case reports up until December 2005 were used to make the decision to stop collecting red cells and plasma in January 2006 before the peak of the epidemic. Later, risk estimates were used to recommence blood collection and were confirmed with testing data from platelet collections. In addition, based on the estimates, there were 7 donations expected to have been viremic before stopping collections, but no transfusiontransmitted cases were reported [106] .",

The sudden appearance and rapid movement of another disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and concerns of mutating influenza viruses that could be spread from person to person (such as was postulated for avian influenza) resulting in a pandemic have made their mark in public health planning, and in transfusion services, a comprehensive pandemic plan is now the norm. Influenza has a short phase of viremia, and the risk of transfusion transmission is likely small if not zero. However, in a pandemic situation, there is potential for a disruption to the blood supply because of donor illness decreasing attendance at collection sites and staff illness having a negative impact on processing of blood units as well as other people-dependent processes such as transportation. Pandemic plans therefore focus on these types of issues and include estimated product requirements (which may reduce during a pandemic), plans for staff redeployment, for vaccination (if available) and prophylactic treatment for staff, and alternatives for current processes. These plans also involve interaction with public health and agreements for priority status for treatment for staff and patients.",

This pressure still exists, but the ongoing focus of current policy often relates to assessment of the potential for simplification of the process rather than necessarily addressing further risk. Multiple layers of donor testing and donor deferral policies implemented over the years have a high impact on operational efficiency, and the cost of blood products and reevaluation are necessary because their individual and combined contribution to safety was not always clear at the time of implementation and may have changed as the epidemiology of disease changed in the general population. As part of the evaluation of safety, surveillance of viral diversity is needed to assess the performance of screening assays.",

The emergence of HIV in the late 1970s/early 1980s had a profound effect on the transfusion industry and was the key factor in recognition that surveillance systems specific to blood transfusion were essential, resulting in improved structure of surveillance, although tending to focus on risks based on sexual activities and injection drug use. Emerging infections since then have had different transmission pathways such as arthopod vectors and the food chain. Emerging pathogens have challenged blood programs to draw upon all resources available for a rapid and effective response. The result has been further development of surveillance methodology and response plans, with recognition that the original focus on risk reduction from sexual/drug-related risk of HIV and hepatitis left large gaps in the preventative measures. For example, the emergence of WNV in North America and recognition that it was transfusion transmissible demonstrated how quickly an emerging pathogen could become a serious transfusion risk and highlighted the inadequacy of the current surveillance systems. In the United States, the rapid development of a national surveillance system for WNV served as a basis for the development of surveillance of T cruzi antibodypositive donors and highlighted the need for ongoing interaction between blood services and public health agencies.",

Examples of this include selective testing for T cruzi in the UK, Canada, and the United States with proposals for such strategies under consideration in Australia as well as selective testing policies for malaria in the UK, France, and Australia. The ARC has already commenced selective dengue testing in Puerto Rico, and Australia is currently undertaking a cost/benefit analysis to assess a similar strategy to minimize component losses during seasonal outbreaks. Similarly, an outbreak of WNV in Italy during 2009 with an increased incidence of West Nile neuroinvasive disease have prompted concerns that donors returning to Australia from these countries during outbreak periods posed an increasing risk. After outbreaks in Greece and Russia during 2010, demonstrating similarly increased virulence, the ABS instituted a 56-day restriction to plasma for further fractionation only for donors returning from the defined outbreak regions. Should the expansion of WNV in Europe continue, targeted WNV NAT may be more cost-effective than component restriction and therefore may be considered as an alternative strategy in Australia.",

In countries without these advantages, the effectiveness of surveillance appears to be similar, but collaborative arrangements have developed largely for specific purposes and rely upon the initiative and continued effort of the transfusion community to maintain them. Transfusion surveillance/public health interaction also has potential benefit to community health such as active surveillance for infections and knowledge of risk factors for infections in a healthy low-risk population, but overall transfusion surveillance tends to be a rather underused resource in this area. Because greater collaborative effort between public health and transfusion surveillance has potential to make better use of personnel and resources and improve both aspects of surveillance, it may be a logical future direction.",

Accordingly, the continued reassessment of current safety policy as well as risk assessment for new pathogens has increased the profile of surveillance programs to apply scientific principles to identify options with acceptable safety standards that are not excessive and make better use of finite health care resources.",
