A key determinant of ability to control the outbreak is the relative timing of infectiousness and symptom onset. We provide a method for identifying this relationship with high accuracy based on data from simulated household-stratified symptom-onset data. Further, this can be achieved with observations taken on only a few specific days, chosen optimally, within each household. The information provided by this method may inform decision making processes for outbreak response. An accurate and computationally-efficient heuristic for determining the optimal surveillance scheme is introduced. This heuristic provides a novel approach to optimal design for Bayesian model discrimination.",

The explanation is intuitive: if symptoms appear before infectiousness, then contact tracing and isolation strategies will be effective, whereas for post-infectiousness symptom presentation, broader, non-symptom based strategies must be adopted. Consequently, identifying the relative timing as early as possible in an outbreak is imperative to assessing potential for control and selecting a measured response.",

As an example, First Few Hundred studies are proposed as a first response surveillance scheme following the identification of a novel disease and/or strain as part of national pandemic plans ( McLean et al., 2010; van Gageldonk-Lafeber et al., 2012; AHMPPI, 2014 ) . Following the observation of a first symptomatic individual, their household is enrolled in an intensive surveillance program, so that day of symptom onset for subsequent cases within that household are recorded. Studies of this form were developed for pandemic influenza in 2009 in both the United Kingdom ( McLean et al., 2010 ) and the Netherlands ( van Gageldonk-Lafeber et al., 2012 ) ; and have been instituted in response to a lack of methods for determining disease epidemiology as required for determining a proportionate response to novel outbreaks. In the Australian Health Management Plan for Pandemic Influenza (AHMPPI), First Few Hundred studies are proposed to be implemented following the first case of a novel influenza strain, with households being tracked nationally (but managed at the state/territory level) ( AHMPPI, 2014 ). Methods have recently been developed to characterise transmissibility and severity of a novel pathogen -other factors influencing ability to control an outbreak -based on such data Walker et al., 2017 ) .

The data observed in each model are the number of observations of the relevant transition each day, within each household: data from four illustrative sample households are shown here. (b) Random forest feature importance for the full 14day design, used to construct the heuristic for smaller designs. Each bar represents a feature, so within each day there are (in this case, for households of size 5) 6 features, corresponding to the proportion of households with each incidence count, each day. (c) Resulting random forest accuracy (proportion of test simulations assigned to the correct model) as design size increases, for the true optimal design (solid lines) and heuristic solution (crosses with dashed line). In this case, random assignment would produce accuracy 0.2. (d) Two-class accuracy of random forest model discrimination: this measures the accuracy of discrimination between models with symptoms before or coincident with infectiousness, versus models with symptoms beginning after infectiousness. In this case, random assignment would produce accuracy 0.52 (red dashed line). These results correspond to households of size 5, with 10,0 0 0 training samples from each model, each with parameters drawn from the distributions displayed in Supplemental Figure S1 .

Two compartments for exposed and infectious individuals allows for a broad range outbreak observation dynamics, and allows Erlang-distributed exposed and infectious periods. Under this model, the timing of symptom onset relative to infectiousness is mapped to which transition is observed: symptoms appear either upon infection, between infection and infectiousness, coincident with infectiousness, between infectiousness and recovery, or upon recovery.

A general difficulty with this theory is that practical implementation is at best difficult, and often infeasible. This has led to methods based on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), which requires only simulation of realisations from each model, and is computationally feasible for a wide range of models. Unfortunately, there exists 'a fundamental difficulty' in establishing robust methods based upon summary statistics ( Robert et al., 2011; Robert, 2016 ) ; however, see the recent work of Dehideniya et al. ( Dehideniya et al., 2018 ) . Another approach to model discrimination in an ABC framework has been proposed by Pudlo et al. ( Pudlo et al., 2015 ) . They treat model discrimination as a classification problem, for which machine learning methods are ideal, and in particular propose the use of random forests to perform this task. This approach provides a highly-efficient, and importantly, robust method for model discrimination. Hainy et al. ( Hainy et al., 2018 ) expand on this approach as specifically applied to optimal design for model discrimination.",

We evaluate, using simulated data, the impact of assumptions and summary statistics.

Therefore, transmission dynamics within households can be modelled independently , i.e., with infection only occurring between individuals within a household, rather than between households. Note that this is an assumption which simplifies the simulation process, but it could be modified if necessary. Given this novel etiological agent, we wish to determine if symptom onset occurs at the time of infection, between infection and infectiousness, coincident with infectiousness, after infectiousness, or coincident with recovery (i.e., these are the five candidate models we wish to discriminate). The model behaviours are otherwise assumed identical. To be emphatic, the underlying disease dynamics is identical in all five models, each differing only in when observations are made, corresponding to different timings of symptom onset ( Fig. 1 a) . We focus on selecting between these observation models as the relative timing of infectiousness and symptom onset is critical to effective outbreak management: quarantine can be applied effectively if symptoms occur before (or possibly coincident to) infectiousness. We model the epidemic dynamics in households as a continuous-time Markov chain (Figure 1a ) ( Keeling and Ross, 2008 ) . Individuals transition from susceptible (S) to exposed ( E 1 , and subsequently E 2 ), then to infectious ( I 1 , and subsequently I 2 ), and finally to recovered (R), with rates as described in Table 1 . The model dynamics are general, but explicitly resemble the dynamics of a respiratory virus such as influenza, as potential future pandemic influenza is of substantial concern globally. The collection of First Few Hundred data is included in the Australian Health Management Plan for Pandemic Influenza ( AHMPPI, 2014 ), along with similar pandemic preparedness plans in other jurisdictions, so demonstrating the ability to discriminate models using these data for diseases resembling influenza is highly relevant. As such, prior parameter choices and the overall duration of the observation process (i.e., 14 days) also reflect influenza dynamics.",

Out-of-bag error is an error metric commonly used with random forests, that is calculated using the training data, rather than a separate test set. It relies on the structure of the random forest: in a random forest, only a (randomly sampled) proportion of training data (i.e., simulations) are used to construct each tree, so the remaining training data may be used to test the accuracy of that tree. Aggregating the result across all trees gives the out-of-bag error. In some cases out-of-bag error is prone to bias, so to ensure we are correctly assessing accuracy we instead use a left-out test set. We report accuracy as the proportion of all test samples that are correctly assigned to their generating model. I.e., we test 10,0 0 0 left-out training simulations from each model, and count those assigned the correct label. We also count the number that were assigned correctly to pre-infectious or coincident with infectious symptoms, versus symptom onset after infectiousness has begun: we call this the two-class accuracy .

We call the number of days D being sampled the design size. We choose those days that produce the highest classification accuracy on a left-out test set. This design problem is small, with only ( 14 D ) designs of size D (or 2 14 = 16 , 384 total designs) to evaluate, so we apply exhaustive search in this case; however a combinatorial optimisation algorithm could be applied and would likely be necessary in a more complex design problem to search for the optimal design. Potentially symptom onset data could be made complete for this style of study by, for example, asking each household on which day all individuals with symptoms first presented with them (rather than just the individuals who presented symptoms on the sampling days); although some loss in quality of data might be expected. In other cases it might be necessary to perform a test (e.g., virological testing) as part of the sampling program, in which case choosing optimal designs that are as small as possible can save substantial resources.

Accuracy increased as the design size (i.e., number of days of surveillance) and the number of households increased. The heuristic produced an effectively indistinguishable level of accuracy compared to the optimal across design sizes, both for overall accuracy ( Fig. 1 c) and two-class accuracy ( Fig. 1 d) . The heuristic ensured a substantial reduction in computation time: to produce Fig. 1 c, 39  Fig. 2. (a) Accuracy of model discrimination in designs of size 5, as the number of households increases, and under partial observation. Note that p obs is not a fixed parameter but is sampled from a distribution: The Beta(5,5) distribution has mean 0.5, and the Beta(7.5,2.5) distribution has mean 0.75. Figure S3 shows the equivalent result with a design of size 14. (b) Difference between heuristic designs (coloured points) and optimal designs (black boxes) as the design size increases. Note that we do not evaluate optimal designs of size 1 or 2, and so there are no optimal designs in these columns. (c) Distribution of training sample observations (under each model and number of households) for the most important feature under the heuristic: the proportion of households with 1 case observed on day 2. Each coloured point represents an observation in the training sample. These results correspond to households of size 5, with 10,0 0 0 training samples from each model, each with parameters drawn from the distributions that appear in Supplemental Figure S1 . random forests were required when using the heuristic, compared to 49,107 random forests to produce the optimal results.",

This is consistent with the feature importance used to develop the heuristic ( Fig. 1 b) , i.e., those days that were consistently optimal were those with highest feature importance.

The non-parametric nature of the random forest is able to use small but clear differences between models (e.g., Fig. 2 c) to extract sufficient information to discriminate them. Combining the raw household data to form summary statistics is critical to this: if the raw household data is used rather than the summary statistics, accuracy is substantially lower. While it can be difficult to interpret the classifications made by a random forest-classifier, interrogating key individual predictors (as in Fig. 2 c) provides clarity, and elucidates why feature importance provides a useful heuristic for choosing optimal designs ( Molnar, 2019 ) . The accuracy of model discrimination decreases substantially as the proportion of cases that are asymptomatic increases. This can be compensated by increasing the number of households ( Fig. 2 a) . The outbreaks in which early control is most critical are likely to be those in which most individuals are symptomatic, due to symptoms being strongly correlated with severity, for example hospitalisations and deaths. However, there also exists diseases for which outbreak control is critical, even when the proportion of symptomatic individuals is very low (e.g., poliovirus).",

Most critically, this model discrimination process assumes that the dynamics of the simulated epidemic model and observation models reflect the actual disease and observation dynamics. It is possible to use this method to select between models that differ in dynamics in addition to the observation process; however any increase in the number of models to classify will likely result in increased computation and potentially decreased accuracy. We have chosen to focus on the timing of symptom onset and infectiousness in one general disease process as an example, resembling influenza in both transmission dynamics and prior distributions on parameters. Useful future work could be to perform similar experiments on diverse disease processes, with different lif e histories. It would also be valuable to assess the robustness of the method for discriminating timing of symptom onset versus infectiousness when the underlying disease transmission model is misspecified. We note that selection between different transmission models (rather than observation models) for disease outbreaks has been considered in other studies, for example, assessing models of transmissibility over time for Norovirus from household data ( Zelner et al., 2013 ) .",

Independence between households is also assumed (i.e., that once a household is infected, all subsequent infection events are due to transmission within that household); this is only potentially valid in the case of a large population of households and the early stages of an outbreak. Household size is uniform across households within the simulation; if household size were allowed to vary, data from each household size would need to be evaluated separately, and more households may need to be observed to obtain suitable accuracy. Assessing optimal design for model discrimination given a range of household sizes would be a valuable direction for future work.",
