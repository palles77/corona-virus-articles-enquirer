However, the predominant bacterial species causing pneumonia secondary to respiratory viral infections other than influenza remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to know whether the pathogens causing post-viral bacterial pneumonia vary according to the type of respiratory virus. Methods: Study subjects were 5,298 patients, who underwent multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction for simultaneous detection of respiratory viruses, among who visited the emergency department or outpatient clinic with respiratory symptoms at Ulsan University Hospital between April 2013 and March 2016. The patients' medical records were retrospectively reviewed. Results: A total of 251 clinically significant bacteria were identified in 233 patients with post-viral bacterial pneumonia. Mycoplasma pneumoniae was the most frequent bacterium in patients aged <16 years, regardless of the preceding virus type (p=0.630). In patients aged \u226516 years, the isolated bacteria varied according to the preceding virus type. The major results were as follows (p<0.001): pneumonia in patients with influenza virus (type A/B), rhinovirus, and human metapneumovirus infections was caused by similar bacteria, and the findings indicated that Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia was very common in these patients. In contrast, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus infections were associated with pneumonia caused by gram-negative bacteria. Conclusion: The pathogens causing post-viral bacterial pneumonia vary according to the type of preceding respiratory virus. This information could help in selecting empirical antibiotics in patients with post-viral pneumonia.",

Each viral infection exhibited a specific seasonal distribution, as shown in Figure 4 . Infections caused by adenovirus, coronavirus, type A influenza virus, and RSV occurred mainly in winter; those caused by bocavirus and hMPV occurred most commonly in spring, and those caused by type B influenza virus occurred most commonly in late winter and early spring (a little later than type A influenza). Parainfluenza infection occurred most commonly in spring and summer, although it was roughly perennial. Rhinovirus infection exhibited a perennial pattern.",

Specifi- www.e-trd.org cally, influenza type A/B virus, rhinovirus, and hMPV infections primarily led to pneumonia caused by S. aureus, while coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, and RSV infections primarily led to pneumonia caused by gram-negative rods. In children, M. pneumonia was the most frequent pneumonia-causing bacterium, regardless of the type of preceding virus. Additionally, we found that the incidences of post-viral pneumonia and post-viral bacterial pneumonia varied according to the virus type; hMPV was associated with the highest incidence of postviral pneumonia, while type B influenza virus was associated with the highest rate of post-viral bacterial pneumonia. A previous study reported that there were no significant differences in symptoms, demographic characteristics, and hospital visit frequency between respiratory viral infection patients with and without post-viral bacterial pneumonia 8 . Nevertheless, it is important to distinguish between the two groups, because patients with respiratory viral infection and post-viral bacterial pneumonia exhibit a worse prognosis compared with patients with respiratory viral infection only 9 .

For the treatment of post-viral pneumonia in infants and children, antibiotics with activity against M. pneumoniae (e.g., macrolides) should be considered. In adults, antistaphylococcal antibiotics should be considered when pneumonia occurs in patients with influenza virus (type A/B), rhinovirus, and hMPV infections, while antibiotics against a wide range of gram-negative bacteria should be considered when pneumonia occurs after coronavirus and parainfluenza virus infections.
