            "text": "The newly emerged Duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV) is responsible for considerable economic loss in waterfowlraising areas in China since 2010. Meanwhile, the virulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV) has also caused sporadic outbreaks in waterfowl. The individual vaccines against both diseases are available, however, there is no bivalent or combined vaccine for either disease. Here, we constructed a recombinant NDV-vectored vaccine candidate that expresses the pre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E) genes from DTMUV, designated as aGM/ prM + E. The foreign prM and E proteins were stably expressed in aGM/prM + E and exhibited similar pathogenicity but higher growth kinetics than those of the parental virus. The aGM/prM + E carries a fusion cleavage site in accordance with avirulent viruses that have been frequently isolated from waterfowl, and induced remarkably (p < 0.001) higher NDV-specific hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers than commercially available live NDV vaccines (LaSota strain). The aGM/prM + E also elicited significantly higher (p < 0.05) virus neutralization (VN) titers than commercially available DTMUV inactivated vaccines (HB strain). The aGM/ prM + E not only provided complete protection against NDV challenge but also reduced the gross lesions on ovarian folliculi and provided 80% protection against DTMUV in ducks. We note that the aGM/prM + E vaccine can prevent challenged ducks from shedding of NDV and DTMUV. Our results suggest that the candidate vaccine aGM/prM + E would help decrease NDV and DTMUV transmissions in waterfowl raising areas in China.",

Later, infections and deaths were reported in chickens (Chen et al., 2014b) , ducklings (Lu et al., 2016) , geese (Ti et al., 2015) , pigeons (Dai et al., 2015) , and sparrows (Tang et al., 2013) . Infected layer ducks typically exhibit a considerable decrease in egg production; primary pathologic changes include ovaritis, ovarian hemorrhage, ovarian atrophy and rupture (Wang et al., 2015b) . In broiler ducks and geese, the primary clinical signs include anorexia, depression, retarded growth, greenish diarrhea, ataxia, reluctance to walk, progressive paralysis and grossly swollen spleens (Yun et al., 2012) . Although commercial vaccines have been developed, the outbreaks of this severe contagious disease among domestic fowl have resulted in large economic losses for the poultry industries in China and Southeast Asia (Homonnay et al., 2014; Thontiravong et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2016) .",

            "text": "Duck Tembusu virus is a mosquito-borne Ntaya group flavivirus from the family Flaviviridae. It is a spherical and enveloped virus, approximately 40-60 nm in diameter. The genome consists of singlestranded, positive-sense RNA, approximately 11 kb in length with a long open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a large polyprotein (Su et al., 2011; Yan et al., 2011) . The polyprotein is cleaved by viral and cellular proteases into three structural proteins (Capsid, C; pre-membrane/membrane, prM/M; and envelope, E) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) (Su et al., 2011; Yan et al., 2011) . Among these, E protein is the major virion surface protein and the primary target for neutralizing antibodies (Heinz, 1986) , and therefore, the first choice for subunit vaccine development (Ma et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2015) . However, the glycosylated E protein and the nonglycosylated M protein of flaviviruses are both associated with the lipid envelope (Heinz, 1986) . Moreover, it has been shown that the chaperone-like activity of prM is necessary for the proper folding of E in Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) (Konishi and Mason, 1993; Lorenz et al., 2002) . Hence, expressing both prM and E protein represents a more thorough, promising approach towards vaccine development.",

However, sporadic reports of Newcastle disease virus (NDV), especially in waterfowl, still raise concerns that non-immune waterfowl may play important roles in the dispersal of NDV (Liu et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2008) . Waterfowl are reservoirs of NDV and deaths have been reported (Higgins, 1971) , some of which were caused by a virus of the genotype VII (Jinding et al., 2005; Qin et al., 2008) , a predominant genotype in recent years in China (Zhang et al., 2014) . As documented in the literature (Hu et al., 2009; Xiao et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2015) , there are many advantages to developing a genotype-matching recombinant vaccine against the currently predominant NDV. Concerning the dispersal of NDV and the outbreaks of DTMUV in waterfowl in China, the development of a vaccine effective against both NDV and DTMUV is urgently needed.",

Meanwhile, the commercial inactivated DTMUV vaccines clinically provide partial or no protection because some ducks was infected as early as 1-2 weeks of age and developed severe clinical signs even death .

Vaccination with the recombinant aGM/ prM + E induced strong humoral immune responses against both NDV and DTMUV, providing complete protection against virulent NDV and 80% protection against DTMUV after boosting.

Although there were no significant differences between the mean VN titers (4.0 log 2 ) of the aGM/prM + E-vaccinated group and the DTMUV-inactivated vaccine-inoculated group at 28 dpi, the gross lesions on the ovarian folliculi revealed that two of the 10 ducks in the aGM/prM + E-vaccinated group had clinical signs of DTMUV infection, and four of the 10 ducks in the HB-vaccinated group exhibited typical lesions including ovarian hemorrhage, ovaritis, and regression ( Table 2) . The viral shedding results showed that aGM/ prM + E-vaccinated group had 40% viral shedding in cloacal swabs at 3 dpc, while HB-vaccinated and PBS-inoculated group had 60% and 80% viral shedding respectively at the same time point. The results of viral shedding in the DTMUV challenged groups at 1 dpc together with the oropharyngeal swabs at 3 dpc were 0-30%, indicating low sensitivity of virus isolation by oropharyngeal swabs or at 1 dpc. It is of note that the VN titer of individual ducks higher than 4.0 log 2 can provide full gross lesions protection against DTMUV challenge. As expected, ducks in the PBS mock-immunized group all exhibited greenish diarrhea at 2 dpc as well as typical lesions on their ovarian folliculi at 4 dpc.",

So it would be more practical to use the predominant genotype VII virus as backbones. Additionally, as reported in the literature (Kim et al., 2007; Mase and Kanehira, 2015; Zhu et al., 2014) , waterfowl represent reservoirs of NDV Class I and have been shown to be avirulent. Therefore, based on a recombinant NDV genotype VII , we mutated the cleavage site to match the feature of NDV Class I. During the insertion of foreign sequences, a plasmid with a single E gene insertion (designated aGM/E) was also constructed (data not shown). However, a viable virus could be only recovered from aGM/prM + E. Since secreted E without the prM protein of DTMUV can be expressed by a recombinant duck enteritis virus (Chen et al., 2014a) , a truncated E gene might be necessary for foreign expression. Moreover, our results confirmed that prM is important for protection efficiency, further suggesting that prM is necessary for DTMUV vaccine development (Chen et al., 2014a) . Another report (Zou et al., 2017) showed that recombinant duck enteritis virus expressing the HA protein of H5N1 plus prM and E protein of DTMUV conferred complete protection against a virulent DTMUV challenge, which re-emphasizes the importance of prM in vaccine protection efficacy. Although the aGM/prM + E virus carries foreign proteins, the virion shape was similar to that of the parental aGM virus. Furthermore, the expression of foreign prM and E proteins was confirmed by western blot, and the co-localization of NDV proteins and foreign DTMUV proteins around the cell membrane using confocal imaging of immunofluorescence staining, confirming correct expression patterns.",

Our results showed that the aGM/ prM + E virus does not depend on exogenously added trypsin for its propagation, which differed from the parental virus and our previous findings . The discrepancy might be attributed to the fusion activities of the foreign E protein of flavivirus (Lindenbach and Rice, 2003) because the HA titers of the recombinant virus were higher at pH 5.0 than those at pH 7.2 at 48 hpi (data not shown).",

As expected, inoculation with aGM/prM + E had no adverse effects on the experimental ducks, confirming that the chimeric virus, as well as the NDV vector, were safe. In terms of the efficiency of the aGM/prM + E virus, its mean HI titer was two-fold higher than that of the LaSota vaccine at 14 dpi, suggesting that a stronger immune response could be elicited by the predominant NDV-matched vaccine, as has been reported in the literature (Hu et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2017; Xiao et al., 2012) . After virus challenge, there was no viral shedding for the immunized ducks, which indicates that a two-dose immunization can yield full protection. Although the mean HI titer of the LaSota vaccine was higher than 5.0 log 2 , viral shedding was not prevented even though the virus was not completely shed after NDV infection (Kang et al., 2016) . The sporadic reports of virulent NDV in waterfowl and outbreaks in intensive raising areas may be attributed to the lack of immunization or the efficiency of commercial vaccines. Therefore, our results provide an ideal choice for the control of ND in waterfowl. The mean VN titers of aGM/prM + E virus and HB vaccine were both less than 2.0 log 2 after primary immunization, indicating that one round of immunization was inadequate. The inactivated vaccines of most flavivirus cannot provide sufficient protection in one dose Wang et al., 2015a) , and many recombinant NDVvectored vaccines require a prime-boost strategy . As our results showed, boost immunization of aGM/prM + E elicited a strong antibody response, resulting in VN titers against DTMUV higher than the commercially available inactivated DTMUV vaccine, and the former afforded 80% protection for ovarian lesions in layer ducks compared to 60% for the latter. As to viral shedding, the former afforded 60% protection compared to 40% for the latter. In general, the magnitude of the immune response to live viral vaccines for primary immunization is substantially greater and broader compared to subunit protein or inactivated virus vaccines (Belshe et al., 2007) . Our results revealed that the prime-boost strategy has a better immune effect in terms of not only on shortening the time required to mount an effective antibody response but also strengthening its protective effects.",

Therefore, the bivalent vaccine candidate aGM/ prM + E would facilitate a decrease in the transmission of NDV and DTMUV in waterfowl raising areas in China.",

Groups of 10 ducks were inoculated subcutaneously with 10 6.0 EID 50 of aGM/prM + E or LaSota or PBS as a negative control. At 14 days post immunization (dpi), the ducks received a second boosting dose. The serum samples were collected every 7 days for analysis. (A) The HI titers that aGM/prM + E elicited (indicated by purple dots) were remarkably higher ( *** , p < 0.001) than LaSota (indicated by blue squares) after 14 dpi by two way ANOVA multiple comparisons statistical analysis. The results from the PBS-inoculated group were negative (less than 1.0 log 2 , indicated by green triangles). The mean HI titers are highlighted with hyphen. (B) By two way ANOVA multiple comparisons statistical analysis, the VN titers that aGM/prM + E elicited (purple dots) were remarkably higher ( *** , p < 0.001) than those from the DTMUV inactivated vaccine (indicated by light blue diamonds) at 14 dpi, and significantly higher ( * , p < 0.05) than those from the DTMUV inactivated vaccine at 21 dpi after boosting. The results from the PBSinoculated group were negative (green triangles).
