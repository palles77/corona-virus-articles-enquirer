However, the use of registry data can have unexpected pitfalls. 3 Factors such as ascertainment artefact, subtle changes in defi nitions, better and earlier diagnosis, and even reimbursement considerations can falsely seem to increase incidence in a population. 4 Kaukonen and colleagues have published an analysis of trends in the incidence and mortality associated with sepsis in adults in Australia and New Zealand that carefully avoided these dangers. 5 They showed that, as for the data for children, incidence was rising but mortality was falling. But they also reported signifi cant diff erences in outcome depending on age and presence of comorbidities. The overall crude hospital mortality in patients with comorbidities was 33% compared with just 5% in patients younger than 44 years of age without other underlying complications.",

Knowledge about illness in travellers contributes to the understanding of disease epidemiology in our interconnected world. In addition to their own ill health, travellers serve as sentinels of infectious diseases; moreover, they can also transmit and disseminate infections. [2] [3] [4] Travellers have shown these important roles in emerging infections such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), dengue virus infection, chikungunya infection, and currently Ebola virus disease, and also in antibiotic resistance. [3] [4] [5] [6] The GeoSentinel Surveillance Network, a collaboration between the International Society of Travel Medicine and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has described signifi cant disease epidemiology in travellers, and has also identifi ed emerging infections through travellers such as sarcocystis on Tioman Island and the ongoing dengue outbreak in Luanda, Angola, in 2013. [7] [8] [9] [10] The strength of the GeoSentinel data, including the EuroTravNet data analysed by Schlagenhauf and colleagues, is the large number of reported cases from diff erent parts of the world. The weakness, however, is that they are mainly descriptive and variations in disease patterns over the years might be attributed to evolving travel patterns including changes in destinations and itineraries. Thus, shifts in disease trends should be inter preted with caution because they might simply be related to changing exposure. Moreover, some diseases (eg, dengue fever) also occur in countries not reporting to GeoSentinel, simply because they are not tourist destinations.",

The data reported are best seen as rough estimates, albeit very good ones, in view of the many diff erences between the two samples. It will be important as others cite and use these data to keep some of their limitations in mind. First, estimates of partner incidence from Goldstone and colleagues 3 are of a somewhat older sample of MSM than those used by Zhou and colleagues. 2 Only half of the Zou and colleagues' sample reported older sexual partners. Furthermore, although the entire sample used by Zou and colleagues was from Australia, 2 only 15% of the Goldstone sample was from Australia, 3 and they had markedly lower prevalence of HPV infection compared with the rest of the study sample. Second, the transmission estimates do not account for penile to penile transfer of HPV, such as through frottage. Third, 4-6 years separate the collection of data in the two studies. These diff erences could bias estimates to be somewhat higher or lower than true rates. Despite these and other potential limitations that Zou and colleagues note, their data are novel and valuable.",
