            "text": "The nucleotide sequence of the glycoprotein (G) gene of sonchus yellow net virus (SYNV), a plant rhabdovirus, was determined from viral genomic and mRNA cDNA clones. The G cistron is 2045 nucleotides (nt) long and the G protein mRNA open reading frame (ORF), as determined from the cDNA sequence, contains 1896 nt and encodes a protein of 632 amino acids. lmmunoblots with antibodies elicited against the purified glycoprotein from virus particles reacted with a fusion protein produced in fscherichia co/i, indicating that the cloned ORF encodes the G protein. The 5' end of the G protein mRNA corresponds to nt 5111, relative to the 3' end of the viral (minus sense) genome, as determined by primer extension from mRNA isolated from infected plants, and extends to nt position 7155 on the genomic RNA. A 34-nt untranslated 5' leader sequence and a 115~nt untranslated 3'end flank the ORF on the mRNA. The gene junctions on either side of the G gene on the genomic RNA are identical to those previously described for other SYNV genes and are similar to sequences separating genes of animal rhabdoviruses. The predicted molecular weight of the G protein is 70,215 Da, a value less than the 77,000 Da estimated for the glycosylated G protein from virus particles. The deduced amino acid sequence of the SYNV G protein shares little direct relatedness with the G proteins of other rhabdoviruses, but appears to contain a similar signal sequence, a transmembrane anchor domain, and glycosylation signals. In addition, the SYNV G protein contains a putative nuclear targeting site near the carboxy terminus, which may be involved in transit to the nuclear membrane prior to morphogenesis. o 1991 Academic Press, h.",

            "text": "Mapping and sequencing of cDNA clones of the SYNV genomic and messenger RNAs has revealed that the gene order is similar to that of animal rhabdoviruses (Heaton et al., 1989) . A 144-nt leader RNA(l) is transcribed from the 3'terminus of the negative strand genomic RNA and is followed by six open reading frames that are expressed by transcription of positive sense polyadenylated mRNAs (Milner and Jackson, 1979; Heaton et al., 1989) . The gene order from the 3' to 5' ends of the genomic RNA is I-N-M2-sc4-M 1 -G-L ( Fig. 1) and each gene is separated by a 16-nucleotide consensus gene junction sequence (Heaton el al., 1989) which contains the transcriptional start and stop sites. The SYNV G protein is associated with the viral envelope (Jackson, 1978) and is thought to interact with the matrix protein, Ml, during morphogenesis. The G protein is glycosylated (Jackson, 1978) as revealed by periodic acid-Schiff staining. Recent experiments demonstrate that the nonglycosylated deriva- The map at the top of the figure represents the organization of the SYNV negative strand genome in the 3' to 5' orientation. The headings I, N, M2, sc4, Ml, G, and L refer to the 144-nt leader transcript, the nucleocapsid protein gene, the M2 protein gene, the scRNA-4 gene thought to encode a nonstructural protein, the Ml (scRNA-6) protein gene, the G protein gene, and the L (scRNA-1) protein gene, respectively. The sequenced region (scRNA-2) corresponding to the G protein gene begins at position 51 11 and extends to position 7155 from the 3' end of the genomic RNA. The recombinant RNA plasmids pGL9, pGL7 1, and pSYNV2 were derived from SYNV genomic RNA and PAT-Kl and pAS3-9 were derived from poly(A)+ from SYNV-infected plants. The plasmids are positioned on the map according to their genomic locations. All clones were completely sequenced on both strands by primer-based dideoxynucleotide sequencing. In addition, two other G protein gene clones, pGT572 and pGT573, spanning the entire cistron, were partially sequenced (as indicated by the solid line). The lines with arrows indicate that the clones bridged a junction between the G gene sequence and an adjacent SYNV gene. tive synthesized in tunacamycin-treated protoplasts migrates in polyacrylamide gels slightly more rapidly than the glycosylated form (Jones and Jackson, 1990) . Moreover, the glycosylated derivative has a central role in morphogenesis of SYNV, since normal accumulation of enveloped bacilliform particles in perinuclear spaces surrounding the nucleus (Christie et a/., 1974) is interrupted in tunacamycin-treated protoplasts, where nonenveloped nucleoprotein cores accumulate in arrays around the inner periphery of the nucleus (van Beek et al., 1985) . These results are compatible with a model for morphogenesis of many plant rhabdoviruses, including SYNV, in which the nucleocapsid assembles in the nucleus and buds through the inner nuclear membrane (Francki, 1973; . In contrast, animal rhabdoviruses such asvesicular stomatitis virus and rabies virus (Wunner, 1987) bud through the plasma membrane or cytoplasmic membrane, respectively.",

These clones were designated pGL9, pSYNV2, pAS3-9, pGL71, and PAT-Kl ( Fig. 1 ). In addition, two G protein clones (pGT572 and pGT573), constructed 2 years after the initial clones, were part'k#y sequenced to provide confirmatory sequence da@. Sequencing was performed with Sequenase (USEI Corp., Cleveland, OH), using the dideoxynucleotide method on both strands of these plasmids by using sequencespecific primers on either single-stranded or doublestranded DNA according to the protocol eugges&d by the supplier. Oligo-nucleotide primers were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems automated DNA synthesizer by the University of Cafifomia--Berkeley Department of Biochemistry. To identify the trenscriitional start site for the mRNA, a 2O-nu~~~~~o~jgo~r complementary to the se-2 mRNA was end-labeled with 32P and used to prime reverse traneoription of poly(A)+ mRNA from SYNV-infected plan& (Z&&ma et al., 1987; Heaton et al., 1987; Hillman et al., 1990) .",

Since SYNV mR#As are presumably transcribed in the nucleus and the N protein mRNA has a polyadenylation signal we previously postulated that SYNV might utilize this signal to initiate polyadenylation by host enzymes. However, since the M2 and M 1 (Hillman et a/., 1990) protein mRNAs lack a polyadenylation signal, the occurrence of this signal may be fortuitous. The animal rhabdoviruses that have been analyzed (Rose and Gailione, 1981; Tordo et al., 1986; Koener ef al., 1987; Teninges and Bras-Herreng, 1987; ) have a cytoplasmic mode of replication and lack the putative polyadenylation signal, yet the mRNAs of these viruses are polyadenylated. Moreover, evidence has been accumulated (Banerjee, 1987; Emerson, 1987) suggesting that polyadenylation of VSV occurs via potymerase slippage or \"chattering\" along the uracil tract of the gene-junction sequence. We heve no direct evidence for such a mechanism with SYNV, but the similarity of the SYNV gene-junction sequences to those of other rhabdoviruses (Heaton et a/., 1989) soggeets that the members of this group all utilize common mechanisms for termination of transcription, polyadenyiation, and initiation of downstream mRNA transcription.",

A second possible translational start site is represented by (M), and the asterisk (*) represents the translational stop lated subclones (pGT572 and pGT573) spanning the entire G gene (Fig. 1) were partially sequenced on both strands to provide confirmatory sequence. The clone pGT572 was sequenced from nt 5111 to 5201, 5522 to 6215, and 6555 to 7158 and differences in the nucleotide sequence were located at nt 5798 (C to A) and at nt 5808 (T to C), which respectively maintained the amino acids alanine and leucine. A third substitution at nt 6046 (C to A) resulted in an amino acid change from alanine to aspartic acid. These changes did not affect the predicted open reading frame of the G gene. However, the addition of an adenine on pGT572 at nt 6922 results in a change of the reading frame deduced from the sequence of pAS3-9 and PAT-Kl and shortens the predicted ORF by 30 amino acids. To provide additional sequence in this region, the other recent G gene clone, pGT573, was sequenced from nt 6789 to 7044 and no additions or substitutions of nucleotides occurred that differed from the originally sequenced material. Since three of four clones are in agreement it seems likely that the additional adenine observed in clone pGT572 either is an inconsistency that occurred during the replication of the viral genomic RNA in the host plant or is an artifact of cDNA cloning.",

Our sequencing data reveal that the ORF of the G gene can encode a 70,215-Da protein, which represents the nonglycosylated form. This is in agreement with the observation that protoplasts infected with SYNV in the presence of tunacamycin, an inhibitor of glycosylation, synthesize a G protein of ca. 70,000 M, (Jones and Jackson, 1990) . Glycosylation of the protein is presumably responsible for the reduced electrophoretic mobility to yield an estimated 77,000 M, for the native G protein synthesized during replication in the plant cell. detected specific binding of four lectins (wheat germ sgglutinin, concanavalin A, and the agglutinins of Pisum sativum L. and Lycopersioon esculenfum Miller) to the SYNV G protein, indicating the presence of the sugars IV-acetyl-flo-glucosamine and mannose. Six potential glycosylation sites (Asn-X-SerTThr) are located at nucleotide positions 5259 to 5267 (amino acids 39 to 41 from the first methionine), 5421 to 5429 (aa 93 to 95), 6297 to 6305 (aa 385 to 387) 6645 to 6653 (aa 501 to 503) 6678 to 6686 (aa 512 to 514) and 6765 to 6773 (aa 541 to 543) (Fig. 4) . Chemical analyses of the G protein will be required to determine which of these sites are glycosylated during the infection cycle. The only discernable similarities in location for these glycoprotein signals and the Sigma virus of Drosophila (Teninges and Bras-Herreng, 1987) and IHNV (Koener et a/., 1987) are their presence at the amino and carboxy-termini. Rabies virus has three glycosylation signals on the G protein sequence; one has a location identical to that of IHNV at the amino terminal portion of the ORF, and the second and third glycosylation signals flank the membrane domain (Koener et al., 1987) . VSV has two glycosylation signals on the G protein sequence, one at the midpoint and the second following the membrane domain, toward the carboxy-terminus (Rose et al., 198 1; Koener eT al., 1987) .",

In general, transmembrane proteins contain three domains: internal, membrane spanning, and external. Typically a transmembrane anchor domain includes a 20-to 27-amino-acid stretch of uncharged, primarily hydrophobic residues (Wiley and Skehel, 1990) . The SYNV G protein shares this feature with several other viral glycoproteins including those of VSV (Rose and Gallione, 1981) rabies (Tordo et al., 1986) , IHNV (Koener et al., 1987) , the Sigma virus of Drosophila (Teninges and Bras-Herreng, 1987) and human coronavirus (Raabe et a/., 1990) . Plant rhabdoviruses can be subdivided into at least three groups depending on the site of nucleocapsid formation and assembly of virions . Two groups appear to repJ&ate in the cytoplasm, maturing either in association with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or in membranes associated with viroplasms, and accumulate in the vesicles of the ER or in vacuole-like sacs, respectively . However, the third group of plant rhabdoviruses, which includes SYNV, differs markedly from animal rhabdoviruses because these plant rhabdoviruses clearly undergo nucleocapsid assembly in the nucleus and mature virions accumulate in the perinuclear space formed by the inner and outer nuclear membrane. Cytopathological studies of SYNV-infected plant protoplasts strongly suggest that the virus buds from the inner nuclear envelope into the perinuclear space during the envelopment phase (van Beck et a/. , 1985) . This suggests a model whereby the G protein is localized in the inner leaflet of the perinuclear membrane prior to morphogenesis (Christie eta/., 1974; van Beek et al., 1985) . The available information suggests that the assembled nucleocapsids accumulate at the patches of G protein and that the virions bud through the inner nuclear membrane into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum.",

Although it is not yet clear exactly what mechanism the SYNV G protein uses to penetrate the inner nuclear envelope, one possible nuclear targeting sequence is evident immediately downstream of the transmembrane anchor domain of the SYNV G protein. This signal begins at amino acid position 591 from the first initiation codon and consists of the region Lys-Lys-Lys-Arg, This sequence appears to be characteristic of the nuclear targeting sequences found within the SV40 T antigen (Kalderon et a/., 1984) the infected celt proteins lCP4 and ICP8 of HSV type 1 (McGeoch ef a/., 1986; DeLuca and Schaffer, 1988; Paterson and Everett, 1988; Knipe, 1989) and the polymerase basic protein 1 of influenza virus (Nath and Nayak, 1990) . Additional inspection of the sequences of other SYNV protein genes revealed that the nucleocapsid and the Ml and M2 proteins Hillman et a/., 1990) also contain similar regions that may specify nuclear localfzation (Goldberg, unpublished data). We are currently initiating studies to investigate the roles of these putative transport signals for membrane localization and viral morphogenesis. ",
