The infection may have started with an unowned shelter kitten that was hospitalized during this same period for a severe atypical upper respiratory infection. The causative agent was isolated from blood and nasal swabs from two cats; the electron microscopic appearance was typical for FCV and capsid gene sequencing showed it to be genetically similar to other less pathogenic \u00aeeld strains. An identical disease syndrome was recreated in laboratory cats through oral inoculation with tissue culture grown virus. During the course of transmission studies in experimental cats, the agent was inadvertently spread by caretakers to an adjoining room containing a group of four normal adult cats. One of the four older cats was found dead and a second was moribund within 48\u00b172 h in spite of symptomatic treatment; lesions in these animals were similar to those of the \u00aeeld cats but with the added feature of severe pancreatitis. The mortality in \u00aeeld cats, deliberately infected laboratory cats, and inadvertently infected laboratory cats ranged from 33\u00b150%. This new isolate of calicivirus, named FCV-Ari, was neutralized at negligible to low titer by antiserum against the universal FCV-F9 vaccine strain. Cats orally immunized with FCV-F9, and then challenge-exposed Veterinary Microbiology 73 (2000) 281\u00b1300 : S 0 3 7 8 -1 1 3 5 ( 0 0 ) 0 0 1 8 3 -8 shortly thereafter with FCV-Ari, developed a milder self-limiting form of disease, indicating partial protection. However, all of the \u00aeeld cats, including the three that died, had been previously immunized with parenteral FCV-F9 vaccine. FCV-Ari caused a disease that was reminiscent of Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease, a highly fatal calicivirus infection of older rabbits. #",

            "text": "Feline calicivirus (FCV) is one of the most common viral pathogens of cats, especially in multi-cat environments such as shelters and catteries. FCV infection and disease occurs in acute and chronic forms (reviewed by Studdert, 1978; Reubel et al., 1992) . The manifesting signs of acute disease depends on the route (oral versus aerosol) and strain of virus. Aerosol infection, which is commonly used in laboratory studies, produces a more serious disease than oral infection, with lesions extending further down the respiratory tract. Hoover and Kahn (1975) described the acute disease produced by 10 \u00aeeld strains of FCV. The disease differed only in severity, with the more virulent strains causing fever, depression, dyspnea, pneumonia, and vesicles/ulcers of the tongue, hard palate and nostrils. Lower virulence strains were less likely to affect the lungs, although other signs were similar. Transient mild conjunctivitis and rhinitis, has also been associated with acute FCV infection, but unlike pathogens such as feline herpesvirus, upper respiratory involvement is not the major feature of FCV infection. Pedersen and colleagues (1983) added the feature of`limping' to the FCV disease syndrome. The lameness appears to be associated with acute viremia and localization of virus and/or immune complexes in the joints (Bennett et al., 1989; Dawson et al., 1994) . Following recovery from acute disease, up to one-fourth of cats will shed the virus for a prolonged period of time from their oropharynx (Bennett et al., 1989; Harbour et al., 1991; Dawson et al., 1993a, b) . Although most FCV carriers are asymptomatic, a small proportion will develop a distinct disease syndrome known as chronic plasmacytic/lymphocytic stomatitis or chronic ulceroproliferative stomatitis (Reubel et al., 1992) . This chronic oral disease is progressive and extremely dif\u00aecult to treat and is perhaps the single most important clinical manifestation of FCV infection today.",

Related caliciviruses, such as rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus, have been associated with severe clinical disease and high mortality. Although recognized strains of FCV have not been associated with signi\u00aecant acute mortality, the calicivirus genome is highly mutable (Johnson, 1992; Pedersen and Hawkins, 1995; Geissler et al., 1997; Kreutz et al., 1998; Radford et al., 1998) and more highly virulent strains could arise at any time. The present report describes the sudden appearance and disappearance of a novel strain of FCV, which induced a severe systemic hemorrhagic-like fever and high mortality. The new strain, named FCV-Ari, has weak to negligible cross-reactivity to current vaccine-induced immunity and would pose considerable risk to cats if it were to spread widely among either vaccinated or unvaccinated animals.",

Sequence data were analyzed on a VAX computer using the University of Wisconsin's Genetics Computer Group (GCG) sequence analysis software package (GCG Program manual for the Wisconsin package, Version 8, 1994). A dendrogram (cladogram) was generated by sequence comparison using the Cantor-Jukes correction, followed by distance calculations using the UPGMA algorithm.",

There were no signi\u00aecant past health problems; he tested negative for FeLV and FIV infections and had been parenterally vaccinated against rabies and FPHCV on 10 April 1997 Ari presented on 19 October 1998 with a history of an acute onset of lethargy and anorexia of 2 days duration. A slight lameness in the right foreleg was noted 2 days prior but had spontaneously resolved. The patient had vomited a bile tinged\u00afuid with\u00afecks of red blood. Physical examination revealed fever and a small crusty lesion on the lower lip. Ari returned to the hospital on 21 October 1998 afebrile and alert, but moderately dehydrated and anorectic. Diffuse facial edema with central ulceration were noted, primarily over the muzzle and left pinna; focal crusty and erythematous lesions were also present on the upper and lower lips. Intravenous\u00afuids, metoclopramide and antibiotic therapy were instituted. Ari was afebrile on 22 October 1998 but anorectic. The facial swelling was mildly increased but the central ulcerated areas seemed to be less exudative. The patient's right forepaw was slightly edematous. Ari was still afebrile on 23 October 1998 but remained anorectic; the edema of the right forepaw remained unchanged. The patient was transported to the UC Davis VMTH for additional testing, including blood and nasal swabs for virus isolation and blood for chemistry and coagulation pro\u00aeles. Blood chemistries revealed moderate elevation of CPK, mild elevation of total bilirubin, and moderate hypoproteinemia. There was evidence of a coagulopathy with moderately increased prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times and a slightly prolonged activated clotting time (ACT). A FCV was isolated in cell cultures exposed to both blood and nasal exudate. Ari was still euthermic on 24 October 1998; however, he was anorectic and his entire face was edematous. The facial lesions had coalesced to form large irregular crusts on both sides of the muzzle (Fig. 1) , and the mucus membranes were slightly icteric. A nasoesophogeal feeding tube was positioned and oral hyperalimentation instituted; this therapy that would be continued until his death. Ari seemed more responsive on 25 October 1998, although still anorectic and hypocoagulable. The patient appeared comfortable on 26 October 1998; there was no more vomiting, but the subcutaneous edema of the right foreleg was persisting. Ari was transfused with one unit of whole blood and low level heparin therapy was instituted to counteract a suspected disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). Dextran 70 was given initially as an IV bolus and then maintained as a continuous infusion. Laboratory tests taken in the evening of 26 October indicated a persisting coagulopathy, hypoproteinemia, and hyperbilibubinemia. Ari was alert, responsive, and afebrile on the morning of 27 October; however, he was diffusely edematous, had mild watery diarrhea and exhibited a slightly increased respiratory rate and effort. Laboratory work revealed a decreased hematocrit, hypoproteinemia and greatly elevated ACT. The patient was then given a second unit of cross matched whole blood. The respiratory rate continued to increase throughout the day and a thoracocentesis was performed late that evening and a yellowish-transudate withdrawn. Ari was alert and responsive on 28 October 1998, but still anorectic. The patient received a third unit of whole blood at midday and more pleural\u00afuid was removed. On 29 October 1998, Ari was quiet, responsive and vocal when handled, but polypneic and totally anorectic. A chest tube was placed to facilitate thoracic drainage and the dextran 70 replaced with hetastarch. Ari was still anorectic and lethargic on the morning of 30 October; he was diffusely edematous with small areas of miliary crusting noted in areas of greatest swelling, especially on the distal limbs. Despite treatment, Ari's condition slowly deteriorated and he died on 8 November 1998 from complications of pneumothorax, shock and cardiac arrest. A FCV, genetically indistinguishable from the earlier isolate, was recovered from blood and tissues at postmortem examination.",

The four cats had not been exposed to other agents and were quarantined from other cats through separate ante-rooms, and were cared for by different caretakers. The caretakers took extra precautions in terms of disposable overalls, gloves, boots, and foot baths, as well as separate food and litter sources, to prevent inadvertent infections from the outside. On the morning of 13 November 1998, one of the four cats (97-659) in this group was found dead and the other three animals were depressed and febrile. Gross necropsy \u00aendings showed a reddened and somewhat swollen pancreas with areas of hemorrhage and saponi\u00aecation in peripancreatic mesenteric fat. Several large areas of yellow-tinged subcutaneous edema were observed in the groin and trunks. The lungs appeared grossly congested with many areas of collapse, and there was a small amount of free\u00afuid in the abdomen and chest cavities. The condition of the remaining three cats rapidly deteriorated, in spite of antibiotic,\u00afuid and whole blood therapy. Cat 96-101 was in shock on 18 November 1998 and euthanatized. The remaining two cats (96-179 and 97-680) were still febrile on 19 November 1998 but were becoming rapidly more depressed; a decision was made to euthanatize them rather than to continue symptomatic treatment. Blood chemistry panels taken near the time of death from all four animals revealed mild to moderate elevations in blood glucose, moderately decreased serum total proteins, and mild to moderate hyperbilirubinemia. Gross necropsy \u00aendings in the three latter cats were identical to those observed in the \u00aerst cat. All three cats had reddened and swollenappearing pancreases with hemorrhage and saponi\u00aecation of peripancreatic fat. In addition to these \u00aendings, cat 97-680 had an edematous omentum, ulceration of the skin on the phalanges of the right hindleg, sloughing of the claw on second digit of the right hindleg, an ulcer of the skin under the jaw, a yellowish edema under the tongue and icteric appearing nictitating membranes. Cat 96-179, in addition to pancreatic lesions, had congestion and consolidation of the right lung lobes, an edematous omentum, and splenomegaly. Cat 96-101 had identical lesions on the pancreas and surrounding tissues, but also had subcutaneous edema with yellowing of the tissues of the hind limbs and edema of all four paws. CrFK and Fcwf-4 cell cultures of blood and pancreatic tissue from all four cats yielded FCV. Genetic sequencing of FCV isolates from all four cats showed them to be identical to FCV-Ari (data not shown). Maximum quarantine was initiated at the time of the secondary outbreak; the virus was only handled under the strictest of quarantine conditions, with special isolation facilities, separate caretakers, complete changes of disposable coveralls, gloves, and foot coverings.

The route and dosage were identical to the initial experimental infection study. Both vaccinated and unvaccinated cats became febrile within 24 h, and the fever persisted for 5\u00b16 days (Fig. 4) . The febrile responses were slightly lower and about 1 day shorter in duration in vaccinated versus unvaccinated cats.

FCV exists in numerous overlapping serotypes but is basically a single species (Gillespie and Scott, 1973) . Different strains vary somewhat in the main types of disease signs that they cause Pedersen et al., 1983; Pedersen and Hawkins, 1995) , but these differences are hard to discern from genetic or serologic comparisons (Dawson et al., 1993a, b; Pedersen and Hawkins, 1995; Geissler et al., 1997; TeeWee et al., 1997) . Although original descriptions of FCV infection suggested that it might be a major cause of mortality in young cats, this has not been borne out by subsequent experimental studies. So-called highly virulent strains of FCV, such as FCV-255 (Gillespie and Scott, 1973) , can exist in breeding populations of cats without signi\u00aecant disease; kittens being infected from 3\u00b19 weeks of age when they still have signi\u00aecant levels of passive immunity (Johnson and Povey, 1984) . Clinical disease can be of acute or chronic form. Acute disease, when it is seen, is generally systemic with vesicular involvement of the oral cavity (ulcers on palate, tongue, in\u00afammation of gums and oral fauces), arthropathy (limping) and mild interstitial pneumonia Pedersen et al., 1983; Pedersen and Hawkins, 1995; TeeWee et al., 1997) . Upper respiratory disease is relatively uncommon, associated with certain strains much more than others, and manifested as a mild and transient bilateral conjunctivitis and rhinitis (compare FCV-263351 and FCV-Cook in Pedersen and Hawkins, 1995) . A viremia is detectable during the \u00aerst week of infection (Pedersen et al., 1983) , and oral shedding occurs for several weeks to months (reviewed by Pedersen and Hawkins, 1995) . The source of viral carriage and shedding appears to be the tonsils and surrounding mucosa (Dick et al., 1989) .",

However, catteries and shelters are more common sources of infection than veterinary clinics, an observation which may have been borne out by the theorized index case in this outbreak, a 4-month old female domestic kitten that had been brought into the hospital from a local shelter and treated for a severe atypical viral infection during the period of 17 September 1998 to 26 October 1998. The dates that this particular animal was in the clinic both preceded and overlapped the dates when client-owned cats were exposed. This kitten was receiving almost constant medical attention and contamination of hands, clothes, instruments, etc., would have been dif\u00aecult to prevent under the strictest of conditions. The disease caused by FCV-Ari in both natural and experimental infections appeared to target blood vessels, as evidenced by the severe edema (sometimes with hemorrhage) in subcutaneous tissues and lungs and local necrosis of skin and adipose tissues. Although vasculitis was dif\u00aecult to discern as a distinct lesion in tissues of laboratory infected cats, it was de\u00aenitely a feature of the early skin lesions that were \u00aerst observed on the cat Ria. Loss of vascular integrity was also the best explanation for the signi\u00aecant drop in serum proteins, icteric serum (from breakdown of extravasated red blood cells), variable thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathies. Elevations in CPK also indicated myonecrosis. The noteworthy feature of the infection was its persistence in the blood of those cases that went on to die; virus was still present in the blood of Ari at the time of his death, almost 3 weeks after \u00aerst clinical presentation. Persistence of viremia may also have explained the death of the index kitten after a 6-week course of illness.",

Similarities included the high mortality, acute nature, the tendency to cause more severe disease in older animals, the ease of spread, hepatocyte tropism, and widespread vascular disease.

Both viruses cause severe necrotizing hepatitis and widespread hemorrhaging. The disease caused by the RHDV is particularly severe, with mortalities approaching 100% in rabbits older than 8 weeks of age (Nowotny et al., 1990 (Nowotny et al., , 1991 .

Experiments conducted on an offshore island showed the potential of the virus as a biologic agent, but before a \u00aenal decision for controlled release could be made, the RHDV appeared in wild rabbits on the mainland. The virus spread rapidly, with over 97% mortality on wild rabbit populations recorded for one region of South Australia (Mutze et al., 1998) .",

The virus is de\u00aenitely more virulent than any FCV strain yet tested by one of the authors (NCP) or reported in literature. It was noteworthy that the cats that became the most ill were also among the oldest. RHDV causes a mild self-limiting infection in rabbits less than 8 weeks of age, while the mortality approaches 100% in older animals (Mutze et al., 1998) . Inherent resistance factors also seemed to play a role; some individual cats developed mild self-limiting disease, while others were devastated by the infection. The close genetic relationship of Ria, Ari and Ian could have contributed to the severity of their illness. At least one of the cats (Ari) was also treated with prednisolone early in the course of his infection, in the belief that the disease was some sort of immune vasculitis.",
