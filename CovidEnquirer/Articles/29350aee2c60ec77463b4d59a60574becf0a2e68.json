The challenge substance for immunoglobulin testing was repeated immunization with six-way distemper vaccination (DHLAPP), while the challenge substance for leukocyte subpopulations was treatment with cyclophosphamide. Immunoglobulin measurements were made by capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and leukocyte immunophenotyping by fluorescein isothiocyanate/phycoerythrin conjugation (flow cytometry). A battery of parameters that would be used in a typical regulatory study were taken to aid interpretation of the data generated by these methods. Body weights, food consumption, clinical observations, complete clinical chemistry and urinalysis measurements were taken. Gross pathology and micropathology of sternal bone marrow, spleen, mesenteric and retropharyngeal lymph nodes, thymus, liver and kidney were completed. The ELISA method demonstrated acceptable intra-assay reproducibility for IgM, IgG and IgE, with values in good agreement as reported for radial immunodiffusion. The immunologic challenge demonstrated a biological trend of an increase in IgM that preceded an increase in IgG with no discernible trend in IgE response, and no abnormalities in lymphocyte subpopulations. Principle flow cytometry findings related to cyclophosphamide were that the relative percent of B cells decreased dramatically and progressively after compound administration; being statistically decreased in males on day 22 compared with day \u2212 5. The relative percent CD4 and CD8 contribution increased, but the CD4/CD8 ratio remained relatively unchanged as total white blood cells decreased progressively. The increase in relative percent CD4 (males only) was statistically significant according to a two-sample t-test on days 17, 20 and 22 when compared with the pre-treatment day \u2212 5. There was a relative percent increase in CD5-panT, but absolute numbers were dramatically decreased. We conclude that an organ system approach to assessment of the immune system which incorporates humoral antibody, enumeration of lymphocyte populations and pathologic evaluation of the lymphoreticular organs assists in the interpretation of an adverse toxicological response. The ELISA method for measurement of Igs detected the expected levels of IgG, IgM and IgE due to repeated vaccinations and to cyclophosphamide treatment. The flow cytometry method was acceptable for www.elsevier.com/locate/toxlet : S 0 3 7 8 -4 2 7 4 ( 0 0 ) 0 0 1 7 3 -9 R.D. Jones et al. / Toxicology Letters 115 (2000) 33-44 34 measuring select canine lymphocyte populations and detecting the expected decrease in B cells due to cyclophosphamide treatment. Both methods may be added to a testing battery for assessing immunotoxicity in canine regulatory studies.",

Imunodeficient dwarfism is a relevant model for elucidating the endocrine role of the thymus in its relationships between the neuroendocrine and immune systems in pre-pubertal dogs (Roth et al., 1988) . Moreover, the predictivity of pharmaceutical agent human toxicities by preclinical animal species is almost 50% from dog or primate studies, but very few toxicities are identified from rat studies alone (Olson et al., 1998) . Therefore, the scientific and medical rationale for using the dog as an alternative immunologic model to rodent species extends beyond being the nonrodent alternative in regulatory studies. The use of albino rodent models is often justified on the basis of reduced maintenance costs and ease of reagent development, but recent progress to transgenic models (Burns et al., 1996) seem more conducive to specific hypothesis testing.",

Nonspecific immunoglobulin changes have been successfully used in human occupational medicine to investigate possible immunotoxic potential of pesticide mixtures, air pollutants and to screen for possible atopic immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated disease (Stiller-Winkler et al., 1999) . When the specific antigen exposure is known, it can be injected or exposed to the test subject, to enhance detection of an immunologic response. Some examples of measuring antigen specific response in the dog are vaccination (Barthold et al., 1995) , diagnosis of atopic conditions, parasitisms (Hammerberg et al., 1997) , autoimmune diseases (Jones et al., 1992) and immunologic challenge from injected sheep red blood cells. The capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method was chosen because it has the advantage of enhanced immunologic sensitivity and accuracy compared with existing radial immunodiffusion (RID) methods (Ginel et al., 1997) . Flow cytometry for lymphocyte phenotyping in the dog has been useful in quantifying lymphocyte subpopulations and, coupled with cytochemical methods, the ontogeny and therapeutic sensitivity of myeloproliferative disorders (Modiano et al., 1998) .",

The preferential inhibition of B-cell response may possibly be due to decreased production and surface expression of immunoglobulins (Burns et al., 1996) . In the dog, Medleau et al.

However, the application of these methods to toxicology testing in dog studies conducted under Good Laboratory Practices has been minimal. The ELISA method was chosen because it has the advantage of enhanced immunologic sensitivity and accuracy compared with existing RID methods (Tizard, 1987) . Nonspecific immunoglobulin changes have been successfully used in human occupational medicine to detect possible immunotoxic potential when the antigen exposure is a pesticide mixture or pollutant, and cannot be injected or exposed directly to the test subject of interest. (Stiller-Winkler et al., 1999) . This study found that when multiple vaccinations were administered, a nonadverse humoral antibody response was detectable. The general immunoglobulin response pattern due to administration of a vaccine challenge was typical of an initial IgM response that preceded IgG then, upon subsequent challenge, an enhanced anamnestic response of both immunoglobulins was observed (Tizard, 1987) . Immunoglobulin E in normal dogs was found in extremely low concentrations, but is of major importance in type I hypersensitivity reactions, atopy, and parastisms (Hammerberg et al., 1997; Ginel et al., 1998) . The coefficient of variation was largest for IgG but all were of similar magnitude as previously reported (German et al., 1998) . This vaccination challenge demonstrated a normal functional response of increased IgG and IgM, and a lack of IgE response that did not translate into an adverse toxicological response.",

However, given the thymus involution and pubertal influences that occur in dogs used in regulatory testing (age range, 4 -18 months), it seems appropriate to account for variation in age and sex when measuring immunoglobulins, as has been reported for IgE (Racine et al., 1999) , IgG, IgM and IgA (Schreiber et al., 1992; German et al., 1998) . The decline in IgM and IgG after CY testing may have reflected the half-life of circulating immunoglobulins, considered to be approximately 7 days (Burns et al., 1996) . Additionally, immunoglobulin levels during CY challenge may have been influenced by secondary systemic effects on protein homeostasis and albumin concentrations, known to correlate with IgG (German et al., 1998) . Previous work with CY in the dog (single dose, 10 mg/kg, intravenously) found decreased lymphocyte numbers but no effect on antibody response or lymphocyte blastogenesis (Medleau et al., 1983) .",

The preferential inhibition of B-cell response may possibly be due to decreased production and surface expression of immunoglobulins (Burns et al., 1996) .

Multivariant statistical analysis of data gathered from assessment of the immune system as a whole, as described by Keil et al. (1999) , would seem a useful tool toward attempting to characterize the complexity of immunotoxicities. We conclude that a concordance approach to assessment of the immune system that incorporates humoral antibody, enumeration of lymphocyte populations and pathologic evaluation of the lymphoreticular organs assists in the interpretation of an adverse toxicological response. The ELISA method for measurement of Igs detected a nonspecific biological response following immunization and after CY treatment. The flow cytometry method detected adverse changes in lymphocyte subpopulations after CY treatment. Both methods are acceptable and may be added to a screening battery, if needed for assessing Tier II immunotoxicity, within the framework of existing guidelines for chronic nonrodent regulatory studies.",
