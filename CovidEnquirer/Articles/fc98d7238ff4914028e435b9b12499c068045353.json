The immunological changes that called immunosenescence are known to be responsible for the increased sensitivity of elderly people to infection diseases.",

Including pneumonia, lower respiratory tract infections are the fourth most common cause of death all over the world. In a study carried out in the US, the annual incidence of pneumonia was observed as 24.8 cases/10,000 adults, with the highest rates among adults between 65 and 79 years of age; 63.0 cases/10,000 adults and in patients up to 80 years old; 164.3 cases/10000 adults (Konomura et al., 2017) . In terms of economic impact, two studies carried out in the Netherlands and Japan, sustained remarkable results. The majority of CAP episodes (64%) occurred among patients 50 years and older and these episodes incurred 76% of the costs. The second study included 29,619 patients with CAP aged 65 years and over and reported median treatment costs of US$ 346 per outpatient CAP and US$ 4851 per hospitalized CAP (Klausen et al., 2012; Kothe et al., 2008) . Mortality in elderly patients may be 25% higher than in the general population (10%). In this population group, hospitalization rates are five times more likely than other patients' groups also (Chong and Street, 2008) .",

For mortality risk, available data is useful. Comorbid illness (including cerebrovascular disease, congestive heart failure, and chronic liver disease), higher infection activity index and ineffective therapy were presented along with higher mortality risk in elderly.

The primary purpose of this score is to distinguish patients that could be safely treated in an outpatient setting versus inpatient observation and treatment. The major limitations of the PSI score are its focusing by age and comorbidity and not consider psychosocial variables, infrequent comorbidities, or patient preferences regarding treatment. The CURB-65 is a less complex scoring system only requires six variables to be evaluated at presentation (Table 7) . (Lim et al., 2003) . For severity assessment and hospitalization decision, the usefulness of these scores are presented in Table 8 . In CURB-65, age is an extremely significant variable. These scores highlight that elderly patients with pneumonia are at risk for higher severe disease and poorer clinical outcome, but the limitations of the CURB-65 score that not contain data such as hypoxemia, electrolyte disturbance or the inability to take oral medications. For prediction ICU admission and the risk of death in patients with severe CAP, several other tools have also been designed. The examples include the PS-CURXO80, SMART-COP, and CAP-PIRO scores. All of these guidelinesdexcept onedinclude age as one of the variables associated with poor outcomes. PS-CURXO80 uses age above 80 years old as one of the minor criterion for determining the severity of illness. The SMART-COP scoring system evaluates the need for respiratory and vasopressor support. In this score, age is not one of the severity markers but tachypnea and poor oxygenation are used as an adjustment tool. Rello and colleagues developed the CAP-PIRO score. This score evaluates predisposition, infection, response, and organ dysfunction variables (Espana et al., 2006; Charles et al., 2008; Rello et al., 2009) .

Overall efficacy remain the major factor for many classes of agents, other factors like pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, compliance, safety, and cost must be into consideration. The most common pathogens of CAP are presented in Table 11 according to the severity of illness as judged by the site of care. In terms of analyzing the microbial etiology in elderly, a cohort study with 2149 CAP patients was shown that when patients divided by age, the microbiological diagnosis possibility decreases steadily with age; 65-74 years old, 44%; 75-84 years old, 41%; and 85 years and older, 31% (Cill\u00f3niz et al., 2013) .

Nonresponding to antibiotics generally result in three patterns of clinical approachment (1) transferring of the patient to a higher level of care (2) further diagnostic testing, and (3) changing the treatment.

An international, multicenter observational study for elderly patients is reported that adherence to the 2007 IDSA/ATS guidelines for hospitalized non-ICU elderly patients was cost-effective but was not the most cost-effective strategy in ICU patients (Faverio et al., 2014) . In elderly patients, another important issue is age-related changes for antibiotic therapy that modify tolerability, metabolism, excretion of drugs and the risk of drug-drug interactions. In case of QT prolongation or concomitant medication that prolongs QT, using macrolides or fluoroquinolones is not suggested. In elderly, Achilles tendon rupture has been reported with fluoroquinolones. With aminoglycosides, nephro and ototoxicity must be kept in mind and presence and degree of renal and/or hepatic failure is always evaluated when choosing the antibiotic treatment (Faverio et al., 2014) . Another important risk in the elderly is the frequency of aspiration. Risk factors for aspiration pneumonia are age, male gender, neurologic impairment, Parkinson's disease, lung disease, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, periodontal diseases, poor oral hygiene, vomiting, proven dysphagia, proton pump inhibitor, antipsychotic or sedative drug use. Diagnosing can be challenging, as a diagnostic tool, fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) can be performed at the bedside. The most common pathogens are oropharyngeal flora including anaerobes, Gram-positive cocci, and Gram-negative bacilli. Antibiotics against indigenous oral flora including anaerobes should be administered and both swallowing rehabilitation and oral healthcare management should be initiated. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is often performed for preventing aspiration, but there is little evidence to indicate that it prevents pneumonia. A head-up position, by $ 30 degree and mosapride, a gastroprokinetic agent may be preventing gastroesophageal regurgitation and associated aspiration. Angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and cilostazol have been reported effective for prevention of pneumonia, because these medications increase substance P levels in the airways and plasma, improving both swallowing and cough reflexes. For prevention, also anticholinergic agents, tricyclic antidepressants, diuretics, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors that which cause dry mouth should be administered cautiously.",

Even only advanced age is associated with higher risk of long term-mortality. Other causes of death after following an episode were mainly related to comorbidities, malignancy, COPD and vascular diseases. As are cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, to increase the rehabilitation and nutritional status after a CAP could ameliorate physical dysfunction in elderly. The effectiveness of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines for prevention of invasive infections among elderly individuals and younger adults have documented with epidemiologic studies. Currently, two types of vaccine are available: polyvalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23)d23 pneumococcal serotypes includeddand the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV13). The only difference of PCV13 is the capsular polysaccharides that conjugated to a carrier protein for enhancement the immunogenicity. Pneumococcal vaccine na\u00efve > 65 years old persons should receive a single dose of PCV13 first, followed by a dose of PPV23 1 year later. Prior vaccination with PPV23 at age > 65 years should also receive a dose of PCV13 if they have not yet received one. A dose of PCV13 should be given > 1 year after of the most recent PPV23 dose. In patients who need to repeat PPV23, the period between administration of PCV13 and the new dose of PPV23 should be at least 1 and 5 years since the most recent dose of PPV23 .",

S. pneumoniae is still the most common pathogen. Elderly patients have a significant number of risk factors associated with higher risk for MDR pathogens. To establish supportive measures, systematic evaluation of cognitive, nutritional (hydration included) and functional status must be an important part of the clinical examination. Antimicrobial selection for elderly patients with CAP does not differ from that of younger adults. In clinical practice guidelines, early antibiotic administration and strict adherence to the regimes is recommended. It is not appropriate to restrict intensive care and ventilatory support only on the basis of chronologic age. There is no difference for management the patients with HAP and VAP in this age group. The long-term mortality rate after CAP hospitalization is really high in the elderly population. As prevention, immunization measures must be improved. Vaccination for pneumococcus and influenza and smoking cessation programs may help for decrease the incidence and severity of CAP, especially in this age group.",
