Influenza epidemics and pandemics are responsible for 250 000-500 000 deaths each year (www.who.int/mediacentre/ factsheets/fs211/en/) and >50 million fatalities worldwide in the past century (www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/ basics/past-pandemics.html), respectively. The next influenza pandemic is estimated to cause $60 million deaths [1] . Ideally, vaccination within 2 months of the outbreak can provide effective protection [2] . However, because several months are necessary for vaccine development and administration, the infection risk is heightened during the non-vaccine period. This is further supported by the outcomes of 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak that originated in China, in which the disease was transmitted globally within few weeks, but the first vaccine Phase I clinical study began a year after the outbreak [3] . Logistically, an effective pandemic preparedness plan should include both vaccination and alternative mitigation methods (pharmaceuticalantiviral; non-pharmaceuticalisolation, administrative control, personal protective measures). Therefore, respiratory protection devices are a key non-pharmaceutical intervention that is essential to the global strategy for pandemic readiness.",

Once a subject is infected, nanometer-to-millimeter-sized pathogenic particles can be released while breathing, speaking, sneezing, or coughing, and infect a host respiratory tract via different mechanisms that depend on the aerodynamic size of the particles (d a <5 mm, lower respiratory tract; 5 < d a < 100 mm, upper respiratory tract). Similarly to infection, current respiratory protection devices filter infectious particles in a size-dependent manner. Filtration efficiency, comfort (e.g., breathability), and fit at the face-mask interface govern technical performance. While effective management and availability of control measures are crucial to an outbreak response, the pathogens [ 1 1 4 _ T D $ D I F F ] (virus/bacteria/ fungi) captured on filters are an intrinsic concern because of fear of cross-infection, new aerosol release, and contaminated waste.",

Because viruses and microorganisms can survive for at least a few hours to several days [4] , masks and respirators become a source of infection for the wearer and others, thus limiting them to single use. Infectious aerosols on filters can also be re-released into the environment (i.e., reaerosolization), for example through accidents.

Ethylene oxide treatment of respirators caused deposition of hazardous residues of 2-hydroxyethyl acetate on the straps, and bleach, oxidants, or dimethyldioxirane raised issues of sharp odor and incompatibility with staples/nosepiece [7] . Despite the need for further research, with safety as a preponderant concern, mask recyclability would be beneficial because it would reduce the amount of biohazardous waste and derived risks.

Based on the same mechanisms, with additional electrostatic interactions of charged fibers, masks offer respiratory protection by filtration. The degree of respiratory protection is affected by the technical performance of the mask (filtration efficiency, comfort, faceseal, proper donning/doffing, and pathogen infectivity), as well as the infrastructure (available supplies, policies, and cost). In addition, because virus/bacteria infectivity is maintained on the fibers, the filter becomes a source of cross-infection, re-aerosolization, and environmental contamination.

Chlorine compounds such as N-halamines and iodine-treated filters have been assessed against bacteria (Micrococcus luteus and Escherichia coli) [9] . In addition, surgical masks functionalized with silver nitrate nanoparticles or quaternary ammonium inactivated bacteria (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, and Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively) by interaction with thiol groups (100% reduction in $48 h) and membrane permeability damage ($92% reduction in 1 h), respectively [10, 11] . However, antimicrobial technologies based on silver/copper, reactive oxygen molecules, iodine, and titanium dioxide did not exhibit inactivation properties against MS2 virus [12] . Another approach to inhibit virus transmission involves modification of the filter surface with the antigen-specific antibodies [13] . Despite the merits of each approach, effective protection against virus aerosols is still limited by slow action (rapid inactivation should occur in the order of minutes, not hours) or binding specificity. Recently, salt recrystallization was found to physically destroy viruses on surgical mask filters within few minutes in a strainindependent manner, potentially enabling reuse without separate processing steps [14] . Notably, most studies have focused on the functionalization of the outermost and middle layers of the mask. The final design of the protection device layers should consider the spatial deposition of aerosols within masks and their contact surface.",

Only a prompt and coordinated response among different sectors of society can maintain security from this threat, which can be implemented through the help of technological innovations and comprehensive planning. Unfortunately, despite being recognized as a key technical element in pandemic/epidemic preparedness, innovation in the design of respiratory protection devices has been sparse. In alignment with the strategic plan for pandemic/epidemic preparedness, we anticipate that incorporation of efficient pathogen-neutralization mechanisms can overcome the existing technical (contact transmission, source control, waste) and non-technical (supply shortage, policies, cost) challenges in respiratory protection. Thus, we expect this engaging field to expand further, with the promise to offer enhanced protection to the global population.",

Bacteria-powered biohybrids (Box 1) present new micromachines to perform complex tasks at the micro-and nanoscale. In vitro, biohybrids have demonstrated the ability to selectively sort particles [3] and even build microarchitectures [4] , but real-world applications for bacterial biohybrids have yet to be achieved. However, the biomedical field offers many opportunities to utilize the micromaneuverability and natural sensing capabilities of biohybrids for non-invasive medical applications that are not possible with current technologies, and recent research has been pushing biohybrids towards this goal. Current bacterial biohybrids have the potential to be used for cancer or disease detection, targeted drug release, and even disruption of infectious biofilm sites. However, many challenges with external guidance, cargo loading and unloading, and efficient swimming remain, hindering their use in clinical and therapeutic applications. We present here recent attempts and developments to improve bacterial biohybrid performance and move the field closer to in vivo medical applications.",
