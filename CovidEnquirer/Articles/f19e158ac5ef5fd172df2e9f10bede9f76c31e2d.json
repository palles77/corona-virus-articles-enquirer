In this study, we identified four B cell epitopes from the spike (S) and membrane (M) protein through bioinformatics analysis and constructed a multi-epitope DNA vaccine. Intramuscular immunization of mice with this vaccine was sufficient to induce specific prime as well as a long-term memory humoral immune response to at least two candidate epitopes, S 437-459 and M 1-20 . A DNA prime-protein boost strategy greatly enhanced the antibody generation and the immune sera not only reacted with the lysates of SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells but also neutralized the cytopathic effect of SARS by 75% at 1:160 dilution. The novel immunogenic S protein peptide revealed in this study provides new target for SARS vaccine design; and our work indicated multi-epitope DNA vaccine as an effective means for eliciting polyvalent humoral immune response against SARS-CoV.",

However, the convalescent sera were reported very efficient to neutralize SARS-CoV infection [2] , and spike-mediated infection could be inhibited by sera from SARS patients [3] , SARS patients derived antibodies to S and M proteins efficiently neutralized SARS-CoV infectivity [4] , indicating neutralizing antibodies as one of the important protective immune effectors. The SARS-CoV encodes four major structural proteins, known as nucleocapsid (N) protein, envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) protein and spike (S) protein [5] . M protein plays a crucial role in assembly and budding of virions [6] ; and S protein is critical for the viral binding to its cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2) through the receptor binding domain (RBD) [7, 8] . Hence, identification of neutralization epitopes within S and M sequence may enable the design of epitope-based SARS vaccines [9] . A couple of immunodominant epitopes from S and M protein of SARS-CoV have been identified through online epitope predication software or epitope mapping technologies and used for potential vaccine targets and therapeutic reagents [10] [11] [12] .",

The SARS-CoV protein sequences in the NCBI GenBank database (Genbank AY274119) representing a Canadian Tor2 isolate were analyzed to identify potential B cell epitopes according to the algorithms concerning the hydrophilicity, surface probability, hydrophobicity, antigenic value, flexibility and secondary structure using DNASTAR software. Four segments designated as S 174-195 , S 437-459 , S 556-568 and M 1-20 were selected for construction of multi-epitope DNA vaccine.",

            "text": "The S protein of SARS-CoV comprises major antigenic determinants that induce neutralizing Abs which makes it a major target for vaccine design and immune therapy. Immune response targeted to S as well as M protein was able to neutralize the SARS-CoV infectivity [22] . Taking this into account, three B epitopes from the S protein and one B epitope from the M protein of SARS-CoV were selected and constructed as a multi-epitope chimeric DNA vaccine.

However, only 2 out of the 4 predicted epitopes (S 437-459 and M 1-20 ) were immunologically recognized by immune sera (Fig. 4B ). This may due to the phenomenon of B cell immunodominance tending to focus the immune response on relatively few dominant epitopes in an antigen. First, antigen availability regulates the hierarchy of peptide epitopes. The folding of the serially connected poly-epitope protein may have caused steric hindrance of certain epitopes while exposing others to the BCR. Second, competition for cytokines may also influence the level of B cell priming and expansion. It was interesting that although the M 1-20 epitope was immunogenic and could be recognized by the sera (Fig. 4B) ; Western blotting failed to detect the predicted band corresponding to M protein in the viral lysates.",

            "text": "A DNA prime-protein boost immunization strategy was employed in this study to enhance the effect of multi-epitope DNA vaccine. Prime-boost vaccination strategies synergistically amplify specific immunity; meanwhile selecting T or B cells having greater avidity and increasing the numbers of memory cells specific for a shared antigen in the prime and boost vaccines [26] . As seen in Fig. 5 , the IgG titer induced by DNA prime-protein boost strategy mounted to 10 6 at 8-10 weeks post immunization, much higher than that induced by protein/protein vaccination. The contributing mechanism might be the more efficient stimulation of antigen-specific memory B cells by DNA priming immunization. Maintenance of memory B cell population might be independent of antigen persistence, but memory B cell must be stimulated by antigen to differentiate into short-lived antibody-secreting plasma cells. Therefore, for vaccines to induce long-term protective antibody titers, repeatedly provide or continuously maintenance with antigen in minimal quantities over a prolonged time period is desperately needed for sufficient numbers of memory B cells to mature to plasma cells [27] . DNA transgene expression persists much longer than the cognate protein due to its intrinsic expression property. Exogenous protein degradates in vivo quickly with time; while the plasmid DNA persists and stably expresses the antigen at least for 3 months at both RNA and protein level [28] ; and the longterm stability of plasmid DNA in muscle even lasts for 19 months [29] . In this study, the expression of DNA-encoding gene could be detected at least for 6 weeks in the muscle (data not shown) which explained the best memory antibody response induced by DNA priming after 8 weeks. CD4 + T cells help and cytokines are also required for stimulation of memory B cells. The potent adjuvant properties of CpG nucleotide sequences in DNA vectors is very efficient to stimulate APCs to upregulate the expression of cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules needed for expansion of CD4 + T, B and memory B cells. Therefore, DNA priming strategy was more effective than the protein priming to stimulate functional long-term memory B cell response. This is consistent with lot of recent reports demonstrating the efficacy of DNA prime-protein boost protocols to augment antibody levels [30, 31] .",
