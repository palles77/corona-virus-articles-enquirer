Seroprevalence surveys in Chile among healthcare worker contacts of patients with HPS caused by the Andes virus showed a prevalence of 0% (9) . A report from Argentina showed that cases due to secondary transmission occurred mostly in nonhealthcare workers after prolonged close contact in the prodromal period (10) .

He received 7.16 \u00d7 10 8 nucleated bone marrow cells/kg body weight from a 9/10 human leukocyte antigen -matched unrelated donor. Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis consisted of a short course of methotrexate and cyclosporin A. Neutrophil and platelet engraftment occurred on days 22 and 65 after surgery, respectively. Despite pre-and post-HSCT anti-infective prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole, colistin, acyclovir, and fl uconazole, Enterobacter cloacae sepsis was diagnosed on day 2. After meropenem treatment, blood cultures remained negative. On day 12, fever reoccurred, elevated C-reactive protein values (229 mg/L) and reduced general health were noted, but no bacterial pathogen was isolated. During this period, the patient received antimicrobial drug therapy with meropenem, tobramycin, vancomycin, and amphotericin B. On day 16, his body temperature peaked to 40.6\u00b0C, and a cough and dyspnea without wheezing developed. Chest radiograph results suggested pneumonia with perihilar infi ltrates. Reduced oxygen saturation (pO 2 86%) was recorded transcutaneously, and oxygen supplementation (maximum 4 L/min) was started by face mask (online Appendix Figure, available from www.cdc.gov/EID/ content/13/9/1425-appG.htm). An NPA sample investigated by multiplex PCR (results provided by W. Puppe and J. Weigl; www.pid-ari.net) was negative for adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfl uenza viruses 1-4, infl uenza viruses A and B, coronavirus, reovirus, enterovirus, Clamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis, B. parapertussis, and Legionella pneumophila, but positive for rhinovirus RNA. Retrospectively, the same NPA sample was reanalyzed for HBoV DNA by real-time PCR (7) and showed a viral load of 4.6 \u00d7 10 7 copies/mL (online Appendix Figure) ; specifi city was confi rmed by sequencing.",

Whether the clinical course in this case was more severe or prolonged than it would have been for HBoV infections in non-HSCT children remains unknown due to the lack of long-term observations in immunocompetent children. The dramatic increase of HBoV load in NPAs and viral dissemination most likely resulted from progressive impairment of cellular immunity as indicated by simultaneous CMV reactivation. Moreover, the increased viral load might have also been a consequence of steroid addition to immunosuppressive therapy to control GvHD. The contribution of HBoV to respiratory disease remains ambiguous because 2 NPA samples were also rhinovirus positive. Additional studies are required to investigate the pathogenic role of HBoV in double or multiple infections. Association of HBoV with the patient's continued diarrhea is in accordance with previous studies (8) (9) (10) . Prolonged fecal shedding has important implications for isolation measures in transplantation units. More studies in immunocompromised patients are required to evaluate the spectrum of pathology caused by this emerging virus.",
