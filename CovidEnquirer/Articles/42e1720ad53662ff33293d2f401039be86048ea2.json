There is no evidence that strains within a given serogroup are antigenically distinguishable, even though they may differ in nucleic acid sequence, replication kinetics, and pathogenicity. For example, RV-UMass and RV-Y belong to the same serogroup, but RV-UMass appears to replicate faster in vitro and to be more pathogenic in vivo (Ball-Goodrich et al., 2001) .",

Productively infected cells usually develop cytopathic effects (CPE), beginning with intranuclear inclusions and proceeding rapidly to cytolysis. The kinetics and severity of CPE depend on virus strain and dose and the level of confluence of the cell substrate. High concentrations of input virus can induce intranuclear antigen indicative of replication within 12 hours and CPE within several days, whereas low concentrations may not induce measurable effects for a week or more. Cultures that contain actively dividing cells are more susceptible to viral infection and replication than confluent cultures.",

The prevalence of clinical signs depends on virus strain and dose, host age, and route of exposure. Host genotype is not known to affect susceptibility to infection or disease. In the context of these variables, RV and H-1 serotypes are demonstrably pathogenic after experimental inoculation, whereas RPV is not. Clinical signs of RV or H-1 virus infection are most readily elicited in pregnant or infant rats. Resistance to clinical illness appears to develop by 1 week postpartum (Gaertner et al., 1996) .

            "text": "Epidemiology. The relative prevalence of the three known serotypes has been complicated by the use of generic antigens for serologic testing. This raises the possibility that RPV has contributed to seroconversions attributed historically to RV and/or H-1 virus. The recent availability of serotype-specific antigens (see below) should make differentiation of parvoviral infections more precise. Rattus norvegicus is the only known natural host for RV, H-1 virus, and RPV. Based largely on studies with RV, infections should be considered highly contagious, ratto-rat transmission occurring primarily by contact with infectious animals per se or particulate contaminants, such as animal bedding (Jacoby et al., 1988; Yang et al., 1995) . Both RV and RPV (and presumably H-1 virus) infect renal tubular epithelium which facilitates excretion in urine. There is some evidence that RV can infect intestinal mucosa and lead to fecal excretion (Lipton et al., 1973) , but intestine does not appear to be a prominent target tissue. Intestinal infection is prominent with RPV, although affecting predominantly the lamina propria . Therefore, its contribution to fecal excretion of virus is unresolved. Natural postnatal exposure to parvoviruses of rats appears due to inhalation and/or ingestion of virus or virus-contaminated fomites. Prenatal transmission is secondary to maternal infection. However, it appears to require exposure of dams to large doses of virus and/or virulent strains (of RV or H-1 virus) Jacoby et al., 1988; Fig. 12-3 Acute rat virus infection.

These properties have been clearly established for RV but should be assumed for all parvoviruses of rats. Susceptibility to persistent RV infection depends heavily on age and immunologic status. Infection in adult immunocompetent rats is usually eliminated within 4 weeks, whereas pre-or perinatal infection can lead to persistent infection lasting at least 6 months, despite the onset of antiviral humoral immunity (Gaertner et al., 1989 Jacoby et al., 1991) . Persistently infected rats also can excrete virus for up to 3 months, and episodic excretion over longer periods cannot be ruled out (Jacoby et al., 1988) . Passive immunization with RV immune serum protects rats from acute and persistent infection . Similarly, maternally acquired immunity appears to protect rats born to persistently infected dams (Jacoby et al., 1988) . However, passive immunity is most effective if it is established prior to infection. Antibody administered even 1 day after exposure to virus provides only partial protection against infection. Thus, the potential for persistent infection develops soon after virus reaches its cellular targets. Immunodeficient (athymic) rats, unsurprisingly, are susceptible to persistent RV infection at any age (Gaertner et al., 1989) . Administration of RV-immune serum to infected athymic adults suppresses but does not eliminate virus, which can reemerge after immunity decays . The environmental stability of RV has been demonstrated by Yang and co-workers, who found that virus remained infectious on plastic surfaces for at least 5 weeks (Yang et al., 1995) .",

Virus infection in these tissues has been documented more recently by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization (Jacoby et al., 1987; Gaertner et al., 1993) , indicating that oronasal exposure leads to viremic dissemination. Lesions caused by pathogenic strains are often widespread but most readily detected in liver, which is both susceptible to infection and mitotically active during infancy. Viral replication causes intranuclear inclusions , followed rapidly by degenerative changes, including ballooning degeneration, intensified cytoplasmic eosinophilia, dissociation of histoarchitecture, nuclear pyknosis and karyorrhexis, and cell lysis.

            "text": "Diagnosis. The diagnosis of parvovirus infection depends on the complementary use of several methods. Clinical signs can be dramatic, but occur rarely. Standard pathologic examination can be useful, especially to detect inclusions and/or lesions compatible with pathogenic infection. However, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity is best achieved with tissue sections by immunostaining or in situ hybridization. Fixation of tissues in fleshly prepared paraformaldehyde-lysine-periodate for not more than 16 hours preserves cytoarchitecture and minimizes denaturation of parvoviral antigens and DNA (Jacoby et al., 1987; Gaertner et al., 1993) . Therefore, this method should be used prior to paraffin embedding to permit maximum flexibility in primary and follow-up examination of tissues or cells if parvovirus infection is suspected. Because infections are frequently asymptomatic, serology is essential for primary detection. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) or immunofluorescence assays (IFAs) using virions or infected cells as generic antigens can be used to detect all known serotypes. Alternatively an ELISA using rNS-1 from MPV can detect infection caused by parvoviruses of rats because NS-1 is highly conserved among rodent parvoviruses . Follow-up testing can employ HAI to directly distinguish RV and H-1 virus infection. Additionally, sera positive by ELISA and/or IFA and negative by HAI would suggest RPV infection. However, the sensitivity of the generic assays is higher than that of HAI, so testing of sera with low concentrations of antibody could produce a false-negative HAI result. Neutralization serology also can be used to distinguish among serotypes, as all replicate in at least one established cell line. This option is comparatively expensive, time consuming, and technically more demanding, making it best suited to use in reference laboratories. The most promising emerging strategy for specific, sensitive cost-effective serologic detection employs recombinant, serotype-specific (capsid) ELISA antigens. They have been produced for RV and RPV as recombinant VP-2 (Ball-Goodrich et al., 2002) . Addition of a corresponding H-1 antigen should be straightforward.",

Control and prevention must take into account the ability of parvoviruses to persist in rats and in the environment, and their capacity for both pre-and postnatal transmission.

JACOBY AND DIANE J. GAERTNER potentially affected rats or rat tissues may have been transported, including research laboratories. Cell lines, transplantable tumors, and other biological products, which may be either a source of or exposed to infection, should be tested rapidly by molecular diagnostics, or the RAP method and contaminated items should be discarded. Strategies to eliminate infection depend on multiple factors, including the value and immunologic status of infected or exposed animals and the ability to replace them from specific pathogen-free sources. Selective culling can be attempted if animals are housed in isolation or individually ventilated cages, but one must consider risks posed by persistent infection and environmental contamination. Attempts to minimize further transmission should include use of barrier caging and change stations, limiting personnel traffic, barrier garb, and strict adherence to room order entry and sanitation during cage changing, including heat sterilization of soiled equipment and supplies. Directional air flow should be tested and affected rooms placed under negative pressure. Rederivation can be accomplished by embryo transfer or cesarean section under stringently aseptic conditions. However, offspring should be tested for prenatal infection by contact transmission (which may include testing of foster dams) or pathologic examination of strategically chosen animals (e.g., at least one per litter). It is important to remember that the prenatal transfer of maternal antibody may render derived progeny at least transiently seropositive, yet protected. Therefore, they should be tested to ensure that antibody titers decay completely by 3 months after birth. A reversal of decreasing titer would suggest active infection.",

Mild infection can be clinically silent and revealed first by seroconversion of sentinel or index rats, but clinical signs are common in many outbreaks. They can occur in non-immune rats of any age, usually last about a week, and occur in various combinations and with varying severity (Jacoby et al., 1975; Bhatt and Jacoby, 1985) . Early signs, especially in sucklings, often include squinting, photophobia, and lacrimation ( Fig. 12-15 ). Older rats frequently develop audible sneezing and palpable enlargement of cervical salivary glands. Closer examination may also reveal serous nasal discharge and pawing at the external nares resulting in wet forefeet. Red-tinged discharges containing porphyrin (chromodacryorrhea) may stain periorbital and perinasal skin ( Fig. 12-16 ). Severe ocular inflammation is expressed initially as keratoconjunctivitis, which may resolve quickly or become chronic. Chronic ocular inflammation can lead to corneal opacities and ulcers, pannus, hypopyon, hyphema, and megaloglobus (Lai et al., 1976) (Figs. 12.17 and 12.18) . Ancillary effects attributable to the discomfort of infection include transient anorexia and weight loss (Sato et al., 2001) and disruption of estrus (Utsumi et al., 1978 (Utsumi et al., , 1980 . Additionally, birth rates and fertility in breeding colonies have been observed to markedly decline during acute epizootics. Although morbidity may be high, RCV infection rarely causes mortality.

Immunity offers protection against recurrence of clinical disease, but protection is relatively short-lived (< 6 months) and does not preclude transient re-infection, virus shedding, and a resultant increase in antibody titer (Percy et al., 1990a; Weir et al., 1990a; Percy and Scott, 1991) . Re-infection of seropositive animals implies exposure to antigenically variant strains. This risk is inherent to coronavirus infections because of spontaneous mutations leading to the emergence of variant strains, especially during endemic infection. Infection of immunodeficient (e.g., athymic) rats is persistent (Weir et al., 1990b; Hajjar et al., 1991) . Such rats can sustain chronic necrosis and inflammation in the salivary and lacrimal glands and the respiratory tract, as described below. Additionally, they can excrete virus for prolonged periods because their capacity for immune elimination of infection is impaired. Apart from oronasal and lacrimal excretion, immunodeficient rats can develop urinary tract infection, which makes transmission by contaminated urine likely. In contrast to the prolonged course of RCV infection in athymic rats, Hanna and co-workers found that immunosuppression with prednisolone had a negligible effect on the course of infection, and treatment with cyclophosphamide resulted in only a modest prolongation.",

Sendai virus is an enveloped, pleomorphic, spherical, or filamentous virus of the family Paramyxoviridae. It has a single-stranded RNA genome that encodes six proteins including a surface HN glycoprotein with hemagglutinin and neuraminidase moieties that are responsible for adsorption to host cells, and a surface F glycoprotein that facilitates cell fusion important to virus entry, expressed cytologically as syncytia formation (Brownstein, 1986) . Sendai virus is also known as parainfluenza virus 1 and can be serologically differentiated from strains 2, 3 and 4. It grows well in embryonated eggs and in multiple established cell lines, including BHK-21 cells. Other biological and biochemical characteristics of Sendai virus have been described elsewhere (Brownstein, 1986) .",

Elimination of virus coincides with the onset of antiviral immunity at about 1 week after initial exposure. Because infection is highly contagious and transmitted by aerosol, rapid spread is common. This effect has been documented by Makino and co-workers (et al., 1972) who observed infection in a colony of 500 breeding rats with subsequent outbreaks re-occurring at 8-to 10-month intervals as newly susceptible rats emerged from the breeding program. Signs of respiratory disease and retarded growth among suckling rats occurred during each episode. Endemic infection is punctuated by fresh clinical outbreaks, typical for acute viral infections in which recovery leads to transient maternally derived immunity followed by renewed susceptibility. Antibody responses to virus remain high for at least several months after acute infection, but decline to low or undetectable levels within 9 months. In these contexts, the epidemiologic pattern and risks from Sendai virus infection in rats resemble those described for RCV infection. However, there is no specific evidence regarding long-term risks for re-infection with Sendai virus. Infection has not been described in immunodeficient rats, but one should assume, as for immunodeficient mice, that it would persist in individual animals and that the risks for transmission would be high. There is no evidence for prenatal infection.",

Patterns of infection and lesions are similar in infant, weanling, and young adult rats, but viral clearance is slower in infants (Castleman, 1983 : Castleman et al., 1987 Giddens et al., 1987) . Thus, virus can be detected beyond the first week of infection, whereas older rats generally clear virus by 1 week. This difference is reflected in a slower onset of humoral anti-Sendai virus immunity in infant rats. Infection causes rhinitis with subsequent development of bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Grossly, affected portions of lung are dark red and consolidated. Otitis media may develop in some rats. Upper respiratory lesions begin within 4 days of exposure to virus, but viral antigen can be detected in respiratory epithelium within l-to 2 days. Early lesions are characterized by epithelial necrosis with mucosal infiltration by neutrophils and lymphoid cells, all of which increase in severity during the ensuing week. Bronchiolitis and pneumonia may begin as early as 2 days after exposure to virus and feature necrosis and inflammation ( Fig. 12-27) . Bronchiolar epithelium undergoes necrosis and erosion, which may be accompanied by epithelial hyperplasia. Viral replication occurs in type I and type II pneumocytes and in macrophages, resulting in necrosis and interstitial infiltration by neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes. Pneumonic lesions are most severe at 5 to 8 days, depending on the age of affected rats, with lesions peaking earlier in weanling or young adult rats than in infant rats. Resolution of pneumonia in immunocompetent rats begins within 2 weeks after exposure and is largely complete within 3 weeks. Residual lesions include perivascular and peribronchial accumulations of mononuclear cells, which may last up to several weeks. Some rats may develop interstitial fibrosis.",

The mechanism(s) of persistence is not well-understood, but prolongs risks for transmission.

In historical perspective, a TMEV-like agent called MHG virus was isolated from rats and infected intestine, lung, and brain after experimental inoculation.

Because reovirus Although sampling should utilize index animals, such as antigens are fairly widespread in nature, it is decidedly retired breeders, whenever possible, the most widely ROBERT O. JACOBY AND DIANE J. GAERTNER accepted approach to assess contemporary conditions in a colony is serologic monitoring of strategically placed and exposed sentinels. Sentinels must be immunocompetent, virus-antibody free, and protected from exposure to infectious agents during shipment. The number of sentinels used should reflect assessment of risks to a colony, as illustrated in Chapter 16. Cages of sentinels should be placed, by rack and room, to facilitate controlled exposure to potential sources of infection. One popular configuration for rats housed in conventional wire-top caging is to place sentinels on the lowest shelf of a rack to maximize natural exposure to bedding expelled from overlying cages. Additionally, samples of soiled bedding collected during routine cage changing (e.g., weekly) can be placed in sentinel cages to increase the sensitivity of detection. This strategy also helps to compensate for the use of isolation and individually ventilated caging, which limits airborne transmission of viral agents and by doing so, also may inhibit early detection of infection. However, limited durability of excreted virus in soiled bedding and the potential that small amounts of virus could be diluted to nonimmunogenic levels in pooled bedding samples also must be considered. Targeted selection of soiled bedding samples also can be helpful to trace infection to a sector of a suspect rack or shelf. For this procedure to work satisfactorily, cage positions should not be changed during the testing interval. Sampling intervals for sentinel rats generally range from 30 to 90 days, but, minimally, must be long enough to complete desired exposure and allow opportunity for seroconversion, which typically occurs by 2 weeks after an immunogenic exposure. Sentinel animals can be sampled repeatedly if they remain seronegative, but should be replaced if they develop antibodies. As a general rule, sentinels, regardless of serologic status, should be replaced every 6 to 12 months to permit incremental assessment, such as histopathology.",

Sampling of animal products destined for in vivo use, such as transplantable tumors or blood products, is essential for a sound monitoring program. It also is important, in this regard, to counsel investigators about the hazards of introducing untested biological products into rats.

Tissue selection and preservation should be guided by a differential diagnosis emerging from clinical and gross pathology examinations complemented by a sound working knowledge of viral infections of rats. Such knowledge should account for the possibility that signs and gross lesions will be absent. Table 12 -1 summarizes current recommendations for tissue collection, preservation, and examination. As noted earlier, aldehyde fixation followed by embedding in paraffin wax is generally suitable for routine histopathology. However, we recommend fixation for approximately 16 hours in freshly prepared paraformaldehyde-lysine-periodate (McClean and Nakane, 1974) if immunohistochemistry and/or in situ hybridization are contemplated, because it provides improved 12.

These samples can be used for virus isolation, molecular testing, or antibody production testing, as initial results warrant. Careful attention to minimize contamination during collection of such samples is critical, especially if the option for PCR testing is to be preserved. It also is prudent to complement examinations for potential viral infection with other microbiological testing to assess the possibility for dual infections or emergence of opportunistic bacterial infections secondary to viral infection.",

Is the infection a threat to research at the affected or collaborating sites? What are the options for control and elimination? Are the options epidemiologically effective, minimally disruptive to research, and fiscally sound? What are the options to prevent reinfection? These questions are best addressed through a thorough understanding of the biology and pathobiology of the offending agent and the functional and structural characteristics of the affected vivarium. Characteristics such as mode of spread, environmental stability, duration, and virulence in immunocompetent compared with immunodeficient hosts and known effects on research can lead to well-established actions for containment and elimination that have been illustrated for specific agents in this chapter. Further, working knowledge of viral infections can facilitate extrapolation of what is known to what may be conjectural due to lack of specific data. For example, the predilection of parvoviruses for mitotically active cells should be a generic factor in considering the potential impact of parvovirus infection on research. However, decision-making is likely to become more problematic as the use of genetically altered rats increases. Rats with either targeted or serendipitous alterations in resistance to infection may have correspondingly altered responses to viral infections. This potential is illustrated by cryptic immunodeficiencies in laboratory mice that can occur as unintended sequelae of genetic manipulation. Therefore, it will be important to consider phenotype as integral to risk assessment, and to broaden clinical, epidemiologic, and pathologic conception of the \"textbook\" spectra of infection.",
