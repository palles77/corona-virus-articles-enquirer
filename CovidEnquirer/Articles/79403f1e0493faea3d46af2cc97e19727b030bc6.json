Overall, 18.5% of the samples were positive for the EU wild-type virus. EU genotype vaccine virus was detected in 1.3% and the NA genotype vaccine virus in 8.9% of all samples. The detection of the EU vaccine was significantly higher in pigs vaccinated with the corresponding vaccine (OR = 9.4). Pigs vaccinated with NA genotype had significantly higher detection chances for the corresponding vaccine virus when compared to nonvaccinated animals (OR = 3.34) animals, however, NA vaccine was also frequently detected in non-vaccinated pigs. Concluding, the dynamics of NA genotype vaccine and EU wildtype virus corresponds with studies on PRRSV spread in endemically infected herds. The potential of spontaneous spread of the NA genotype vaccine should be considered in the planning of eradication programs.",

The data was analysed in the light of the vaccination history on farm in order to determine any spontaneous spread of PRRS vaccine virus. However, a full description of the herd factors and practices which might have influenced vaccine spread was not in the scope of this paper. Due to the hierarchical nature of the data (one or several pigs submitted per farm), the expected clustering effect had to be corrected for both the prevalence estimation and the regression analysis. This was achieved by using the respective modules offered by the software package (STATA). Without such adjustment, confidence intervals might have been too narrow and P-values too low, leading to effect overestimation. We therefore consider our results to be less biased and rather conservative.",
