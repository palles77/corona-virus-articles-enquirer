The principle using ELP-tagged proteases for the separation of tag-free target proteins is shown in Fig. 1 . The human rhinovirus 3C protease and small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) protease from yeast were used to demonstrate the proof-of-principle for this method. The human rhinovirus 3C protease is a specific protease that recognizes a peptide LEVLFQ/GP and cleaves between the Gln and Gly residues [14] . SUMO protease can recognize the tertiary structure of SUMO moiety instead of a peptide sequence and cleave in the diglycine motif at the junction between SUMO and the target proteins [15, 16] . Both proteases have been expressed and purified from Escherichia coli [16, 17] .",

The human rhinovirus 3C protease and small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) protease from yeast were used to demonstrate the proof-of-principle for this method. The human rhinovirus 3C protease is a specific protease that recognizes a peptide LEVLFQ/GP and cleaves between the Gln and Gly residues [14] . SUMO protease can recognize the tertiary structure of SUMO moiety instead of a peptide sequence and cleave in the diglycine motif at the junction between SUMO and the target proteins [15, 16] .

The ELP-GFP was purified by ITC as described above. It was shown that highly purified ELP-GFP was recovered after two rounds of ITC (Fig. 2B, lane 4) . To release the ELP tag from the GFP, the ELP-GFP was digested using ELP-3C protease at a protease-to-substrate ratio of 1:100 (w/w) in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA] , and 1 mM dithiothreitol [DTT]) at 5\u00b0C for 16 h. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the ELP-GFP was efficiently digested by ELP-3C protease. After enzymatic cleavage, NaCl was added into the digestion mixtures to trigger the phase transition of ELP, resulting in aggregation of the cleaved ELP tag and ELP-3C protease. After centrifugation at 14,000g at room temperature for 10 min, the supernatants and pellet were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Only the GFP band was found in the supernatants (Fig. 2B, lane 7) .

First, ELP-3C protease is easy to produce in ordinary laboratories because the procedure for preparation of ELP-3C protease is simple, and this can save the cost of buying commercial proteases. Second, ELP-tagged protease as well as the cleaved ELP tag can be removed from the target proteins easily by centrifugation after the triggering phase transition of the ELP, so it saves time, labor, and cost. Third, higher yield of the recombinant proteins can be achieved compared with that of the utility of the self-cleaving ELP tag given that there is no risk of premature cleavage of the fusion protein containing a protease recognition site in vivo. Besides 3C protease, the principle can also be applied to other proteases for various purposes. Unlike 3C protease, SUMO protease from yeast recognizes the tertiary structure of the SUMO tag and releases the target protein with no additional amino acids at the N terminus, which is considered as a robust protease [15, 16] . Therefore, ELP-SUMO protease has also been expressed and isolated by ITC from E. coli (Fig. 2D ). The yield of purified ELP-SUMO protease was approximately 11.8 mg/L. ELP-SUMO protease could efficiently digest the ELP-SUMO-GFP to release the GFP from the ELP-SUMO tag (Fig. 2E, lane 5) . But a band of ELP-SUMO was observed in addition to the GFP band in the PAGE gel after ITC (Fig. 2E, lane 7) , suggesting that the ELP-SUMO was not completely precipitated. To solve this problem, the free ELP protein was added to the digestions to facilitate the aggregation of ELP-SUMO. After triggering the transition of ELP, ELP-SUMO and free ELP were coag- Fig.1 . Schematic map of illustrating purification of recombinant proteins using ELP-tagged proteases. The ELP fusion protein was separated by ITC from the lysate and digested by ELP-tagged protease to release the ELP tag from the target protein. After enzymatic cleavage reaction, another round of ITC was carried out to precipitate the cleaved ELP tag and ELP-tagged protease. Thus, the tag-free recombinant protein with high purity was recovered from cell lysate without chromatography. gregated and completely separated from GFP by centrifugation (data not shown). The final yield of GFP was approximately 17.1 mg/L. ELP-tagged SUMO protease can be applied to isolate target proteins with a native N terminus.",
