Here we present a phylogeny of 18 bat species, each of which is represented in 1,107 orthologous gene alignments used to build the tree. We generated a transcriptome sequence of Hypsignathus monstrosus, the African hammer-headed bat, and additional transcriptome sequence for Rousettus aegyptiacus, the Egyptian fruit bat. We then combined these data with existing genomic and transcriptomic data from 16 other bat species. In the analysis of such datasets, there is no clear consensus on the most reliable computational methods for the curation of quality multiple sequence alignments since these public datasets represent multiple investigators and methods, including different source materials (chromosomal DNA or expressed RNA). Here we lay out a systematic analysis of parameters and produce an advanced pipeline for curating orthologous gene alignments from combined transcriptomic and genomic data, including a software package: the Mismatching Isoform eXon Remover (MIXR). Using this method, we created alignments of 11,677 bat genes, 1,107 of which contain orthologs from all 18 species. Using the orthologous gene alignments created, we assessed bat phylogeny and also performed a holistic analysis of positive selection acting in bat genomes. We found that 181 genes have been subject to positive natural selection. This list is dominated by genes involved in immune responses and genes involved in the production of collagens.",

Estimates of the exact number of species vary, but all estimates show bats represent a large portion of the known mammalian species, representing \u223c925 of 6,400 known species, about 15% (1, 2) . Several characteristics of bats make them inherently interesting, most uniquely their ability to fly and echolocate. Bats are also notorious for harboring viruses that transmit to humans [called zoonotic viruses (3) ]. For instance, bats are the established reservoir hosts for SARS coronavirus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus (1, 4) . Hypsignathus monstrosus, the hammer-headed bat, has been identified as a possible reservoir host of Ebola virus (5, 6) . Marburg virus, a close relative of Ebola virus, has been isolated from Rousettus aegyptiacus (7, 8) .",

Genetic information allows researchers to gain a deeper understanding of the evolutionary origins of such diverse taxa. There are several previous phylogenic analyses conducted with bats across the order Chiroptera (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) . Given the difficulty of obtaining genetic data from a species group with such extreme diversity, there has historically been a tradeoff between number of loci analyzed and number of species analyzed (i.e., more loci can be reasonably analyzed only when a smaller number of species is considered). Some studies tackle hundreds of species at once. Most recently, Amador et al. constructed a tree containing 799 species by performing a supermatrix analysis with maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony methods using up to nine gene sequences per species (16) . Highthroughput sequencing is now lessening the burden of this tradeoff because a number of bats across the order Chiroptera have had their genomes or transcriptomes sequenced in bulk. Two studies have undertaken phylogenetic analyses of these large datasets (13, 15) .",

Ideally, one creates a Significance This work represents a large, order-wide evolutionary analysis of the order Chiroptera (bats). Our pipeline for assembling sequence data and curating orthologous multiple sequence alignments includes methods for improving results when combining genomic and transcriptomic data sources. The resulting phylogenetic tree divides the order Chiroptera into Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera, in disagreement with the previous division into Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera and in agreement with some other recent molecular studies, and also provides evidence for other contested branch placements. We also performed a genome-wide analysis of positive selection and found 181 genes with signatures of positive selection. Enrichment analysis shows these positively selected genes to be primarily related to immune responses but also, surprisingly, collagen formation. set of alignments representing each gene, each of which includes the correct ortholog from each species under analysis. However, accurately assembling short reads, identifying orthologs, and curating/vetting multiple sequence alignments from transcriptomic and genomic data are difficult tasks in an evolving field (17) . In previous studies of bats that employed highthroughput sequencing data, these bioinformatic issues were partially addressed by collecting most of the data at the same time with similar methods: whole-genome sequencing in the case of Tsagkogeorga et al. (13) or transcriptomes in the case of Lei and Dong (15) . However, the complexities of creating high-quality orthologous sequence alignments are compounded when public data from multiple sources are combined because these datasets have been collected with a variety of methods and from either chromosomal DNA or transcribed RNA. These issues may, in part, explain why the phylogenies of bats that have been created to date agree on much of the history of Chiroptera but differ in many ways as well.",

Of particular interest would be genes that have undergone positive natural selection in bats, possibly allowing them to better survive infection by viruses but also likely improving other processes that are specific to bat physiology, immunology, or ecology (18) (19) (20) . Positive natural selection produces in gene alignments an unusually high ratio of DNA substitutions which change the protein sequence (dN) to those that do not (dS), measured by dN/dS > 1 (21, 22) . Limited previous analysis of positive selection in bat genomes has been performed. Typically, selection has been analyzed only in key gene families for specific purposes (13, 23, 24) . These studies yielded interesting results, but we still lack a holistic view of the categories of genes most affected by selection in bat genomes.",

Manual inspection of many multiple sequence alignments of orthologous genes revealed a nonrandom source of error: the species were biased toward segregating by data type (i.e., genomic data vs. transcriptomic data). Some poorly aligned regions would tend to agree within data type but disagree between data types. An example is shown in Fig. 2A . Furthermore, the splits were observed to happen at sharp boundaries highly suggestive of exon boundaries. This effect can be largely explained by the fact that we chose the longest isoforms predicted from annotated genome sequences, even though the longest isoforms might not be expressed at high enough levels to appear in the transcriptomic datasets from a given tissue. Other artifacts in transcriptomic or genomic data assembly and annotation could also contribute to this effect.

By alternate consensus run, we mean the situation as shown in Fig. 2A , where some subset of species has a long run of amino acids which are internally consistent but which disagree from the majority of the sequences. While no substitution pattern in a single column of an alignment can distinguish real biological mutations from artifactual mismatching of isoforms, runs of an alternate consensus sequence are exponentially unlikely as a function of run length according to all site substitution models, so we want to remove them before analysis. Briefly, the MIXR algorithm works as follows. First, we define the alternateconsensus-run score, designed to give high scores to runs where some subset of species is internally consistent but differs from the majority of species. We then find the maximum alternateconsensus-run score for all species bipartitions (divisions of the species into two subsets) in a given alignment, such as the bipartition into transcriptomic and genomic species in Fig. 2A . Finally, exons with significant scores are removed. See Methods for additional details.",

This is correlated with but distinct from the alternate-consensus runs defined for the MIXR algorithm as it is independent of the substitution model used for the MIXR scoring function.

We see that the most significant reduction in secondconsensus runs is due to the exon structure filtering step, and MIXR cleaned up essentially all of the runs which passed the previous two steps. After cleaning, only seven runs of more than three columns were detected, and those were up to only five columns in length. Furthermore, all but one of these alignments contained only species with genome data available, removing the concern of separation by data type. As a second measure of alignment improvement, we checked that the filtered sequences had increased overall sequence conservation.

(A) Some multiple sequence alignments were observed to demonstrate isoform selection biased toward separation of genomic and transcriptomic data, causing nonrandom, nongapped errors segregated by the artifact of data type. (B) The alignment cleaning pipeline. First, each gene derived from genomic data was revisited to choose the isoform which best matches the consensus alignment sequence. Second, exons were filtered by structure, where exons with disagreement about boundary positions in the alignment and exons with >1% length difference between species were filtered out. Last, exons were filtered using the MIXR algorithm described in the text. (C) A total of 3,444 improved genomic isoform selections were performed, shown as a function of the improvement in percent matching the consensus sequence, i.e., (percent matching after) -(percent matching before). (D) Counts of unanimous second-consensus runs after each step of the alignment cleaning pipeline (with steps progressing from top to bottom in the graph). Unanimous second-consensus runs are defined as runs of more than three columns in a row where some minority of bat sequences agree with each other but disagree with those of all other bats. The final output contains only seven such runs with two or more species, and these are only up to three species and five amino acids long. (E) In each step of the alignment cleaning pipeline, weakly conserved sites are filtered at higher rates, enriching the final alignments for conserved sequences. \"Strong,\" \"Weak,\" and \"None\" conservation categories are as defined by Clustal (47) .

The ortholog finding process scores sequences based on length of agreement, which naturally tends to include matching sections in the center. The ends are then more free to vary, with variability expected due to differences in isoform selection, as well as due to incomplete or incorrect transcript assembly. Transcripts tend to have less coverage near the ends and correspondingly poorer assembly. This also helps explain why so many unanimous sites end up being filtered: correctly matched exons will still be filtered if partial assembly results in exons of different lengths.

No data assembly and cleaning strategy, including our own, is perfect, and it is possible that sufficient errors remain in our data as to result in an erroneous topology of such closely related species.

SI Appendix, Fig. S6 , takes a focused look at the data for these five bats in the 100 manually (54) (55) (56) (57) (58) .

(59) proposed that the genus Desmodus be placed sister to the rest of the phyllostomids, which were to have formed the subfamily Phyllostominae.

            "text": "Positive Selection Analysis. Finally, we looked within bat genomes for signatures of positive selection acting on protein-coding genes. We used the PAML software package (61) to identify dN/dS > 1 codons within each of the orthologous gene alignments that we created. We used codon models M8 and M8a, which estimate the evolutionary pressures that have acted at specific codon sites over the entire phylogeny of species included. These models do not consider unique evolutionary scenarios that have affected gene evolution along different branches over the phylogenetic tree like some other models. In M8, the data in each multiple sequence alignment is fit to a model where one group of codons from within the alignment is allowed to evolve with dN/dS > 1. M8a is the null version of this model, where that same category of codons is allowed but is constrained to dN/dS = 1. Because there is one additional degree of freedom in M8, the data will usually fit better to the M8 model (as estimated by a likelihood value). A gene was deemed to be evolving under positive selection when the data are a statistically better fit to M8 than to M8a (P < 0.05 after correction for multiple tests; Dataset S1). We performed this analysis on 10,650 genes that met criteria of having at least six species and 30 codons represented in the alignment. Out of these, 181 genes met the statistical criteria for being subject to positive natural selection, and these genes were hand-curated for function (Dataset S1). Table 2 shows a subset of the genes. Nineteen percent are known to be involved in immunity or the replication cycles of pathogens. Surprisingly, 8% are known to be involved in collagen formation, including 10 out of the 27 top scoring genes for positive selection (Dataset S1). We also looked at the gene ontology (GO) classifications which are overrepresented in the list of genes under positive selection and present this data in Dataset S2. The GO categories most enriched for positively selected genes are dominated by immune responses and collagen formation. *These genes are placed in two categories on this table. \u2020 Relatively little is known about these genes, but they are expressed solely in the testis.",

            "text": "Understanding the evolutionary history of bats is important not just for the study of Chiropteran zoology but also for the study of bats as reservoirs of deadly human viruses. Knowledge of an accurate phylogeny improves analysis of positive selection in bat genomes because dN/dS analysis requires both gene alignments and a phylogenetic relationship of the orthologs being analyzed. Also, the reliable identification of gene orthologs will allow molecular biologists to functionally test differences in these genes from one species to the next (62) . Functional studies such as these will allow us to understand whether some bats have unique features of their immunity that allow them to harbor viruses that are dangerous to humans (63) . Herein, we have curated multiple sequence alignments of thousands of bat genes. Using both genomic and transcriptomic data, we were able to find 11,677 orthologous gene families. To enhance these alignments, we provided transcriptome data for two of these bats, H. monstrosus and R. aegyptiacus, from which we annotated 7,858 and 9,682 genes, respectively. We furthermore developed a general data cleaning method for filtering exons with nonrandom structural errors, in this case observed to result from genomic vs. transcriptomic data. For this method, we developed the MIXR software package which directly detects and removes alternate consensus run artifacts, and is available at http://github.com/hawkjo/mixr. The multiple sequence alignments that we have created for bat genes, both before and after exon filtering, are available for use by the wider bat and virology communities (http://numerical.recipes/chiroptera/). Using these alignments, we examined the history both of speciation and of positive selection in 18 species of bats. This study hopefully sets the stage for continued and more in-depth study of the evolution and functional differentiation of bat genes relevant to immunity and beyond. Using these orthologous gene families, we were able to reconstruct the phylogeny of the order Chiroptera using multiple methods. Due to the sheer scale of the data, we resolved each node in the tree with 100% reported posterior probability, although the topology differed slightly depending on the analysis method. Our results support the division of Chiroptera into the two suborders Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera, in disagreement with the traditional division into Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera. However, we acknowledge that rooting ancient clades continues to be a difficult phylogenetic problem, and further data may shed more light on this issue. We furthermore provide evidence for the placement of M. schreibersii, in which we agree with Hoofer and Bussche, supporting their proposal for the separation of Miniopteridae into its own family (53) . We also provide evidence for the disruption of proposed subfamily Phyllostominae by D. rotundus. Most intriguingly, we saw M. leucogaster placed in the Myotis genus, which will require further investigation.",

Previously, work aimed at describing adaptive evolution in bats primarily focused on their unique traits, selecting families of genes to study for selection. These studies can broadly be divided into two categories, those that dealt with specific life traits, such as echolocation or metabolism related to frugivory (24, (64) (65) (66) (67) (68) (69) (70) (71) (72) (73) , and those that were related to pathogens or immunity (74) (75) (76) (77) (78) (79) (80) . There are three studies that used larger datasets, two of which used whole-genome data (13, 23, 24) . Unlike our study, Tsagkogeorga et al. (13) used genome-wide data to ask which genes might explain the alternative subordinal topologies supported by their data. Similarly, the Shen et al. (24) study was specifically interested in energy metabolism in bats due to their energy-expensive mode of locomotion, flight. Finally, Zhang et al. (23) used whole-genome data available from two distantly related bats, along with orthologs from a number of mammals, and inferred adaptive evolution in the innate immune pathway and DNA damage checkpoint path-way. Our work, in comparison, includes more Chiropteran species and a holistic analysis of selection in the bat genome. The addition of more species, and the generation of a high-confidence tree for these species, gives us better resolution for detecting adaptive evolution specifically within Chiroptera (81) .",

Collagens are a family of structural proteins that form connective tissues in the body, including tendons, ligaments, and skin (89) . The walls of veins, arteries, and capillaries also contain collagen (90) . Collectively, the different forms of collagen constitute the most abundant protein in mammalian bodies (89) . Bat wings consist of a network of collagen (91) , and bats often have injuries on their wings which need to heal quickly (92) . Recently, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, a fungal pathogen that has killed more than 6 million bats, has been reported to damage collagen (93) . It is less clear how pathogens would have placed pressure on collagen-formation pathways in the past, across many species. Alternatively, it seems possible that the demanding physical and physiological constraints inherent in muscle-powered flight put bats at an edge of what is evolutionarily achievable. In that case, one might expect to see, after speciation events, comparatively more positive selection in wing-and flightrelated genes compared with genes involved in other adaptations, with collagen an indicator of the former set.",

To implement this algorithm outline, we needed to define three things: hypothesis bipartitions of species, the alternate-consensus-run scoring function, and the method used to determine significance.",

Both the M8 and M8a models assume the dN/dS value for a given aligned codon is either a draw from a binned beta distribution (with fit parameters a and b) or a draw from a floating bin with parameter dN/dS = \u03c9. The parameter \u03c9 can float to values >1 in M8 and is set to \u03c9 = 1 for M8a. P values were calculated via \u03c7 2 test on twice the difference in reported log likelihoods of the two models, a likelihood-ratio test of nested models.

(A) Some multiple sequence alignments were observed to demonstrate isoform selection biased toward separation of genomic and transcriptomic data, causing nonrandom, nongapped errors segregated by the artifact of data type. (B) The alignment cleaning pipeline. First, each gene derived from genomic data was revisited to choose the isoform which best matches the consensus alignment sequence. Second, exons were filtered by structure, where exons with disagreement about boundary positions in the alignment and exons with >1% length difference between species were filtered out. Last, exons were filtered using the MIXR algorithm described in the text. (C) A total of 3,444 improved genomic isoform selections were performed, shown as a function of the improvement in percent matching the consensus sequence, i.e., (percent matching after) -(percent matching before). (D) Counts of unanimous second-consensus runs after each step of the alignment cleaning pipeline (with steps progressing from top to bottom in the graph). Unanimous second-consensus runs are defined as runs of more than three columns in a row where some minority of bat sequences agree with each other but disagree with those of all other bats. The final output contains only seven such runs with two or more species, and these are only up to three species and five amino acids long. (E) In each step of the alignment cleaning pipeline, weakly conserved sites are filtered at higher rates, enriching the final alignments for conserved sequences. \"Strong,\" \"Weak,\" and \"None\" conservation categories are as defined by Clustal (47). Percent reduction in multiple sequence alignment column counts shown to the right.

Furthermore, the relationships between the ranges of the bats in this clade roughly match our consensus phylogeny: M. ricketti lives in southeast Asia, M. davidii lives in central China, M. leucogaster lives in southeast Asia and central China, Myotis brandtii lives across Europe and parts of northern Asia, and Myotis lucifugus lives in North America",

Total RNA was enriched for mRNA using the Poly(A) Purist Magnetic kit (Life Technologies; AM1922). The mRNA was fragmented using the NEBNext Mg Fragmentation module (NEB; E6150S) and column purified using RNeasy MinElute kit (Qiagen; 74204). mRNA ends were repaired using T4 Polynucleotide kinase (NEB; M0201L) and ATP (Ambion; AM8110G). A final concentration step was run using the RiboMinus Concentration Module (ThermoFisher; K155005). Adaptors were ligated (NEB; E6120L), and mRNA was converted to cDNA (Invitrogen; 18080093). The library was then PCR amplified and size selected. H. monstrosus cDNA was sequenced on Illumina HiSeqs 2000 and 2500, both generating 2 \u00d7 101 bp paired end reads, and R. aegyptiacus cDNA was sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2000 and NextSeq, with 2 \u00d7 101 bp and 2 \u00d7 151 bp reads, respectively.
