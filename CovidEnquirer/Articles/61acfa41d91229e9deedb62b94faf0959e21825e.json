Unlike other rich economies in the rest of the world, however, air quality in HK is poor and transboundary air pollution is a serious concern. For example, the annual average concentration of particulate matter (PM 10 ) in HK was 45 \u00b5g/m 3 from 2000 to 2015, which was more than twice WHO's recommended level of 20 \u00b5g/m 3 . The NO 2 concentration was 63 \u00b5g/m 3 during this period, roughly 1.5 times higher than the WHO's corresponding threshold.",

Our identification strategy builds on the fact that transboundary pollution (i.e., pollution transmitted from mainland China) plays an important role in determining HK's air quality. HK is located near mainland China's Pearl River Delta Economic Zone (PRDEZ), a major manufacturing center. Emissions from heavy industrial activities in the PRDEZ are brought to HK by wind, creating exogenous variations in local air quality. Using instruments based on the combinations of wind direction, air pollution in the PRDEZ, and distance between the PRDEZ and different districts of HK, we show that air pollution causes more people to die from cardio-respiratory diseases. Specifically, we estimate that a 10-unit increase in the Air Pollution Index (API) can cause a 1.77% increase in monthly cardio-respiratory mortality. 2 The elderly are particularly vulnerable to air pollution, with a 10-unit change in the API leading to an 8.41% change in mortality. To understand how the air pollution effect changes over time, we split the sample by different sub-periods and find that the effect has been diminishing in the past two 1 The GDP per capita of the HK is 46,000 USD as of 2017.

First, this study is among the first efforts to estimate the causal health effects of air pollution in a high-income and high-pollution context. Existing literature mostly focuses on developed countries with a low level of pollution, such as the U.S. and the E.U., or developing countries with a high level of pollution, such as China and India. The high-income high-pollution setting is important because the air pollution effect can be non-linear and the pollution-mortality relationship may be altered by better institutional, and socio-economic background (Arceo et al., 2016; Burnett et al., 2014) . Within the small set of studies that focus on HK, most of them are associational studies that may suffer from endogeneity concerns (e.g., Ko et al., 2007; Qiu et al., 2012; Wong et al., 2001; Wong et al., 2002) .",

We also find that the air pollution effect is larger for districts that do not have a hospital with Accident and Emergency (A&E) services, highlighting the critical role of emergency care in saving vulnerable people from dying from air pollution attacks. Several alternative explanations, including dose-response between pollution and mortality, smoking, and avoidance behavior, can be ruled out after further analyzing relevant data. Our finding suggests that a well-established medical system can help mitigate the contemporaneous health effect of air pollution, which also partly explains why HK people can have the longest life expectancy in the world despite breathing relatively dirty air.",

Section III describes our data and presents some stylized about HK and the PRDEZ's air quality. Section IV reports the main findings and Section V discusses the diminishing air pollution effect. Section VI concludes. Air quality is a major concern in HK and transboundary pollution is an important source of HK's air pollution. In the scientific literature, studies have examined how air pollutants from the PRDEZ affect HK's air quality. For example, because of the heavy manufacturing and economic activities in the PRDEZ, particulate matter from the PRDEZ can account for approximately 50% to 60% of average pollution levels in HK and increase to as high as 70% in certain periods (e.g., Wu et al., 2013; Yuan et al., 2006) . Several factors influence the severity of transboundary pollution in HK, including the baseline air pollution levels in the PRDEZ, wind patterns, and distances between the PRDEZ and different districts of HK. Depending on the wind's direction, HK's air pollution can be high or low: when HK is downwind of the PRDEZ, the wind will carry the PRDEZ's pollutants to HK and the air quality in HK will be negatively affected. In contrast, when HK is upwind of the PRDEZ, HK's air quality will be improved as regional air pollutants are carried away by the wind.",

As a result, transboundary pollution remains a controversial and largely unresolved issue between the mainland and HK. Figure 1 presents the annual average of PM 2.5 concentrations derived from satellite data for the region. 4 We observe that air quality in the PRDEZ is significantly worse than in HK. This is 3 \"One Country, Two Systems\" is a constitutional principle formulated by Deng Xiaoping to accomplish the peaceful reunification of China by resolving the sovereignty questions of Hong Kong, Macao and perhaps Taiwan arising from a complicated historical background. Under the principle, mainland China adopts the socialism with Chinese characteristics system, while Hong Kong and Macao have their own governmental systems, legal, economic and financial affairs. 4 The PM2.5 concentrations are derived from Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) satellite data using the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model (van Donkelaar et al., 2014) . The AOD data are extracted from the National Aeronautics reasonable because the PRDEZ has a significant manufacturing sector, while HK has almost no manufacturing. 5 Besides, the northwestern part of HK has higher levels of air pollution than the southeastern part, because it is closer to the PRDEZ. These variations underlay the instrumental variable approach used in this study.",

            "text": "The identification typically relies on the assumption that, after controlling for a set of observed weather confounders and different trends, day-to-day variation in air pollution can be treated as exogenous. A large number of public health studies that rely on time-series models generally find that poorer air quality is associated with worse health outcomes. Early time-series studies mostly focused on developed countries (e.g., Bell et al., 2004; Dockery et al., 1993; Levy et al., 2012; Pope III et al., 2002; Stieb et al., 2002) , while in recent years, there has emerged a literature focusing on developing countries (e.g., Aunan & Pan, 2004; Lai et al., 2013; Lu et al., 2015; Shang et al., 2013) . and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States. For illustrative purposes, we use data from 2006 in Figure  1 . 5 According to the HK government, local emission sources mainly include motor vehicles, marine vessels, and power plants. Details can be found at https://www.gov.hk/en/residents/environment/air/airquality.htm. However, time-series studies often suffer from omitted variable bias because not all confounders can be properly controlled for. To address this issue, researchers often include a large set of fixed effects and include flexible functions of time trends and weather conditions in the model. This introduces several potential problems. First, the estimates from time-series analyses tend to be sensitive to different controls and inclusion of trends, making it difficult to assess which estimates are the most reliable. Second, if air pollution is measured with error, overfitting the time-series model can attenuate the estimates and understate the air pollution effect. As a result, it is difficult to determine whether the poorer health outcomes were actually caused by elevated air pollution levels or by other confounding factors (Chay & Greenstone, 2003a, b; Pope III & Burnett, 2007; He et al., 2016) . For HK, we find that most previous studies rely on time-series models (Ko et al., 2007; Qiu et al., 2012; Wong et al., 2001; Wong et al., 2002) , and similar critiques also apply to those studies.",

In the end, people choose where to live and these choices may depend on pollution and other factors. For example, the wealthier individuals tend to migrate to areas with lower pollution, while the poorer individuals may remain in the polluted areas.

First, many epidemiological studies have investigated the dynamic impacts of air pollution on health outcomes and a general finding is that air pollution can lead to worse health outcomes at a more aggregated level (e.g., Zeger, Dominici and Samet, 1999; Schwartz, 2000; Zanobetti et al., 2000; Zanobetti et al., 2002; Costa et al., 2017; Zanobetti and Schwartz, 2008; Deryugina et al., 2019) . The reason is that people will develop more complex cardio-respiratory diseases with prolonged exposure to air pollution and the affected population will increase over time. Monthly data therefore allows us to capture the air pollution effect in the medium run. Second, our instruments are based on transboundary air pollution from one region to another and it takes time for the transmission to take place. If we use daily data, current-day pollution in PRDEZ may not be able to strongly affect current-day air quality in HK, especially when weather conditions are relatively stable. It is thus conceptually unappealing for the instrument to work with high-frequency daily data.",

As shown in Appendix Figure S3 , there exists a strong correlation between HK and the PRDEZ's air quality. The trend of air pollution in HK has closely followed the trend in the PRDEZ. The air quality deteriorated from 2000 to 2004 and then started to improve in both the PRDEZ and HK. Table 2 summarizes the IV estimates on the impacts of air pollution on different mortality rates. Existing evidence suggests that short-term and long-term exposure to ambient air pollution primarily affects CVR diseases (Pope III et al., 1995; Chen et al., 2013; He et al. 2016; Ebenstein et al. 2017) . We follow the literature and estimate the effect of air pollution separately for CVR (Columns 1-3) and non-CVR causes (Columns 4-6). The dependent variable is the logarithm of the monthly standardized mortality rate per 10,000; the interpretation of the estimated coefficient is therefore percentage change in monthly mortality rate. In all the regressions, district (LTPUG) fixed effects and year-month fixed effects are included. We gradually include precipitation and temperature (and the square of temperature), which are typical confounders in the regressions, to check the robustness of the estimates. We also report the standard errors clustered at different levels to examine the sensitivity of the significance: the LTPUG level, the LTPUG and year level, and the LTPUG and year-quarter level (Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller, 2011) .",

Existing evidence on the gender difference in air pollution epidemiology is far from conclusive and the mechanisms are not yet clear (Clougherty, 2010) . This is because males and females are different in fundamental ways that can affect the pollution-mortality relationship, including time use, smoking, inner dermal absorption and lung function, and the availability of target organs (McCracken et al., 2007; Becklake and Kauffmann, 1999) . We explore the gender heterogeneity in HK and report the results separately for males and females in Table 3 . We find that the impacts of air pollution on males are generally larger and more statistically significant than females. A 10-point change in the API increases the male mortality rate by 2.22%, which is two times larger than its impact on females. In the literature, several other studies also find stronger air pollution effects on males (e.g., Pope III et al., 1995; Galizia and Kinney, 1999; Tanaka, 2015; Ebenstein et al., 2015; Cohen et al., 2017) .",

To address this issue, we conduct a rich set of formal tests following Knittel, Miller, and Sanders (2016) . We first predict air pollution of each HK's air quality monitor using all other surrounding monitors within 20 miles, weighted inversely by distance. The discrepancy between each monitor's predicted pollution level and the monitor's actual recorded value is interpreted as the \"error.\" Second, to test how the \"error\" and its variance depend on the true pollution level and distance to the closest monitor, we run an OLS regression of the \"error\" on the monitor and",

Adding controls and fixed effects significantly change the point estimates and the significance level.

Second, in the most restrictive model (i.e., Column 6), a 10-unit increase in API is associated with a 0.67% change in CVR mortality rate. This estimate is substantially smaller than the IV estimate (1.77%) in Table 2 , suggesting the potential attenuation bias in the fixed-effects models. These findings are consistent with several quasi-experimental studies (e.g., Schlenker and Walker, 2015; He et al. 2016; Deryugina et al. 2019) , which also find that estimates of the air pollution effects obtained using a quasi-experimental design were much larger than estimates obtained from associational approaches.",

The distribution of the errors is displayed in Figure S6 where the division of different time periods is the same as Figure S4 ).

We use the 2-km buffer zone because it roughly divides all the LTPUGs into two groups with equal sample sizes (Appendix Figure S5 ). 16 Table 8 summarizes our findings separately for these two groups. Columns 1 and 2 report the results for districts located within the 2km radius of A&E services and Columns 3 and 4 report the results for districts located outside the radius. The estimates are statistically insignificant for both CVR and non-CVR mortality rates in Columns 1 and 2, suggesting that air pollution is less likely to kill people in districts with A&E services. In contrast, air pollution has a statistically significant impact on CVR mortality for people living far away from hospitals with A&E services. These results suggest that easy access to emergency medical services can reduce pollution-related deaths, which are consistent with our argument that the availability of high-quality medical service is important for mitigating the air pollution effect. In addition, we check the robustness by varying the buffer zones of A&E services to 1.5km and 3km and report the results in Appendix Table S11 . The estimates are quantitatively similar and indicate the same pattern that closer to A&E services is associated with less mortality from air pollution.",

This argument is often used to explain the finding that males are more likely to die from air pollution than females. If this argument were true and if there were fewer and fewer smokers over the years, the air pollution effect could decrease. To examine this hypothesis, we collect data from the HK Government and compare the smoking population over time. We find that, somewhat to our surprise, the percentage of smokers has remained almost unchanged during the entire period (see data in Appendix Table S13 and Appendix Figure S8 ).

We argue that medical improvement initiatives and the development of community-based services implemented after SARS are likely to drive the declining air pollution effect. Empirically, we show people with immediate access to emergency healthcare are less susceptible to air pollution in comparison to those without, and the diminishing impacts are not driven by several alternative explanations. As pre-mature deaths are considered as the largest social cost of air pollution (other costs include morbidity, reduced productivity, etc.), our findings suggest that better socio-economic conditions and a well-functioning medical system can help reduce the damage of air pollution, at least in the short run. Governments and policymakers should thus consider the role of healthcare when formulating air pollution policies.",

First, while a diminishing effect of air pollution on mortality is observed, it does not mean that air pollution becomes less important in HK. The long-term effects of air pollution on mortality and morbidity remain poorly understood. Second, while the heterogeneity results between districts with and without immediate A&E services suggest quality medical service can be important, this finding does not have a causal",

To what extent the A&E services causally affect the air pollution-mortality relationship requires exogenous changes in the A&E service availability, which is missing in this study. Finally, the API is a comprehensive air quality measure and is determined by the pollutant with the highest concentration level in the standard. Our analyses do not identify which between which pollutants are more health-damaging and tell little about how the interactions of different air pollutants can affect human health. Further studies are needed to investigate these issues. Figure S1 . (2011)). The standard errors are respectively reported in the parentheses below the estimated coefficients.

A map of the LTPUGs is provided in AppendixFigure S2.Data for the year of the SARS outbreak, 2003, are dropped in the analysis because it can confound the air pollution effect estimates. Nearly three hundred people died from SARS, but these deaths were not related to air pollution. In addition, during the SARS epidemic, economic activities and daily life of people in HK were significantly changed(Hung, 2003;Siu & Wong, 2004). For example, most people used face masks and avoided going outside during the outbreak, which could affect pollution exposure and reduce their chances of contracting other types of respiratory diseases.",

The vertical solid red line and the vertical dashed blue line indicate the mean and mean plus 2 standard deviations, respectively. We conclude from Figure 4a that the unexplained error is small in magnitude and are not correlated with the true pollution levels. Figure 4b presents the average errors by distance to the nearest monitor, suggesting no clear relationship between the bias or variance in the unexplained errors and the distance to the nearest monitor.In addition, we perform a Monte Carlo simulation to further test the robustness in IV estimates according toKnittel, Miller, and Sanders (2016). For each iteration of the simulation, we construct a 'pseudo-pollution measure' as each district's air pollution level. The pseudo-pollution measure' adds three components compared to the baseline model. In practice, each district's 'pseudo-pollution measure' is constructed from the following equation:(6) \u202b\u074a\u0745\u0750\u0751\u0748\u0748\u0732\u2212\u0740\u0751\u0741\u074f\u0732\u202c ,\u0be7 = \u202b\u0741\u0751\u074e\u0736\u202c \u202b\u074a\u0745\u0750\u0751\u0748\u0748\u0732\u202c ,\u0be7 + \u202b\u0740\u0741\u0750\u073f\u0745\u0740\u0741\u074e\u0732\u202c \u202b\u074a\u073d\u0741\u072f\u202c \u202b\u074e\u074e\u074e\u0727\u202c ,\u0be7 +\u07dc \u00d7 \u202b\u0740\u0741\u0750\u073f\u0745\u0740\u0741\u074e\u0732\u202c \u202b\u074e\u074e\u074e\u0727\u202c ,\u0be7\u0b3f\u0b35 + \u07f6\u123a0,1\u123b \u00d7 \u0da7\u123a\u0732\u202b\u0750\u073f\u0745\u0740\u0741\u074e\u202c \u202b\u074e\u074e\u074e\u0727\u202c \u202b\u0741\u073f\u074a\u073d\u0745\u074e\u073d\u0738\u202c + \u07db \u00d7 \u202b\u0740\u0741\u0750\u073f\u0745\u0740\u0741\u074e\u0732\u202c \u202b\u074e\u074e\u074e\u0727\u202c ,\u0be7\u0b3f\u0b35 \u0b36 \u123b",
