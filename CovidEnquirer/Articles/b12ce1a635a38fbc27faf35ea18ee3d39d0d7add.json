This, with the assistance of fibrin in inflammatory reactions, can result in localization of lesions within the abdomen, although peritonitis can also be more or less generalized. Omental bursitis is an example of peritonitis localized within a compartment, and the peritonitis of traumatic reticulitis is frequently localized by fibrin and adhesions. Blood or fluid in the abdomen can occasionally be localized within a cystic structure but is usually generalized. The peritoneal membrane forms \"ligaments\" between organs surrounded by it, and in some cases these ligaments are involved in bowel entrapments, particularly the nephrosplenic ligament in the horse. Normal holes, such as the epiploic foramen, and congenital or acquired defects in the double layer of peritoneum making up the mesentery can also be involved in entrapments.",

It seems that a horse's peritoneum dries out shortly after death because if examination is postponed for a few hours, apposed serous surfaces stick to each other so that when separated the serosa is drawn into tags; this is especially evident on the diaphragm and viscera touching it. These changes should not be taken as residue of peritoneal inflammation or confused with the fibrous tags of scar tissue that occur on the diaphragmatic surface of livers that have been traversed by many larval nematodes. Distinction should also be made between antemortem and postmortem effusions and discolorations. Some lymph accumulates in the peritoneal cavity after death, and this becomes stained with hemoglobin as soon as erythrocytes in the serosal vessels begin to undergo lysis. Such fluid does not clot and is also present in other serous cavities. Its nature is usually evident because gaseous changes of putrefaction accompany the lysis of erythrocytes. Diffusion of bile pigments through the wall of the gallbladder, the biliary ducts, or the duodenum will stain adjacent viscera. Where hydrogen sulfide from the intestine meets hemoglobin from lysed erythrocytes, greenish black sulfmethemoglobin is produced to discolor the tissues.",

In tissues generally, there is a small excess of filtration at the arteriolar end of the capillary bed over absorption at the venous end of the capillary bed; the excess of fluid is drained from the tissue spaces by lymphatics. These mechanisms are operative in abdominal viscera, but it is to be noted that free fluid in the peritoneal cavity drains through the ventral diaphragm and the sternal lymphatics.

In spite of the large area of peritoneum, fluid absorption from the cavity is virtually limited to those diaphragmatic lymphatics that form an abundantly anastomotic plexus in the muscular portion of the right side of the diaphragm. Vessels penetrate the diaphragm to form a corresponding pleural plexus from which the lymph is conveyed in the sternal ducts to the anterior sternal node, and then via the right lymphatic duct to the vena cava. There are subsidiary pathways that will deliver some peritoneal lymph to the cisterna chyli or thoracic duct, but 80% or more of peritoneal lymph will follow sternal lymphatics.

There is the additional possibility of retarded lymphatic flow, and although there appear to be no measurements of this, the tortuous dilatation of lymphatics in some cases of congestive heart failure are quite suggestive. Ascites occurs in congestive heart failure without edematous transudations elsewhere, especially in dogs and cats, but it should be pointed out that only a minority of cases of congestive failure in dogs and cats is associated with ascites. Excess peritoneal fluid is also part of a generalized dropsical condition in cachectic diseases, anemia, and starvation. Although the mechanisms have not been intensively studied, hypoproteinemia has been given consideration as one of the principal factors. Very probably it is also in those diseases that are known, or presumed, to result in chronic protein leakage and loss, such as gastrointestinal trichostrongylosis and Johne's disease. Hypoproteinemia appears not, however, to be of initiating significance in the edema and ascites of chronic starvation without other accompanying disease; it is suggested in such cases that the fluidretention serves largely to replace wasted tissues, especially adipose tissue.",

Corynebacterium pyogenes, Escherichia coli, or a miscellany of organisms are frequently present in these, and in some the extension of the inflammatory process can be traced up the inguinal canals from castration wounds; in other cases of similar type, the peritonitis is localized to the inguinal and pelvic regions, is adhesive, and causes death from intestinal obstruction. Occasionally, C. pyogenes produces discrete encapsulated abscesses as profuse implants on both visceral and parietal peritoneum.

Mycoplasma hyorhinis and possibly other mycoplasmas may produce a serofibrinous peritonitis that becomes fibrous, with adhesions to a thickened serous membrane; this disease is to be distinguished from Glasser's disease. Small, firm, lemon yellow nodules and flattened disks of inspissated fibrin often are found free in the peritoneal cavity in chronic Mycoplasma infections. Rectal strictures in swine cause a very dilated colon and cecum full of ingesta. The serosa is frequently thickened, white, and covered with fibrin tags, resembling infectious serositis. The thickening is probably caused by subserosal edema and fibrosis but may be due to passage of bacteria or by-products through the intestinal wall. Stephanurus dentatus larvae cause subserosal focal hepatitis and a mild reaction with edema in the perirenal fat and retroperitoneal tissue, and sometimes in the mesentery and local lymph nodes as they move to the kidney. In intestinal anthrax in swine there is an acute gelatinous hemorrhagic peritonitis very typically localized to the mesentery between the intestine and the mesenteric node.

Subcapsular infiltrations occur particularly in the liver, lung, and pancreas, and the pyogranulomatous reaction can develop deep in the parenchyma, particularly of the kidney. In the spleen and lymph nodes there are histiocytic and fibroblastic proliferation and either depletion or hyperplasia of lymphoid follicles. In addition to focal lung lesions, there may be a diffuse interstitial pneumonia, sometimes most severe close to the visceral pleura.

Toxins from peritonitis may be absorbed directly through the peritoneum into retroperitoneal venules and lymphatics or may be carried from the peritoneal cavity via the diaphragmatic lymphatics. Death from toxemia may result before obvious peritonitis develops. The peculiarly efficient diaphragmatic lymphatics remove not only fluid but also particulate matter, including bacteria, and in this way the inflammation may spread via the lymphatics to the pleura and the mediastinal nodes.

The development of ileus has the advantage that exudates are no longer distributed by intestinal movements, but there is also the disadvantage that fibrinous adhesions develop between loops of intestine, and if the animal recovers, they scarify and produce fibrous adhesions that may cause intestinal stenosis. Assessing the age of peritonitis may have significance, such as in iatrogenic rectal perforation, and requires careful gross and microscopic examination of the serosal surface and the adherent fibrin.

The removal and destruction of any particulate matter, including bacteria, from the abdominal cavity is one function of the lowly omentum; it is so generously endowed with phagocytes that their clusters are often visible to the naked eye as small milky spots. These fixed histiocytes are very efficient at ingesting bacteria and, if exposed to opsonins, of destroying them. In the case of Johne's disease, the organisms may be ingested by the macrophages but protected from destruction. When the bacteria are sufficiently virulent, they may proliferate in and destroy the phagocytes. This, no doubt, is why in many instances of acute peritonitis the omentum is first and most severely involved in the inflammatory reaction. It is also a ' 'purpose'' of the omentum to seal off foci of inflammation, and this it does with exceptional efficiency. The omentum is continually moved about the abdominal cavity by bodily and intestinal movements, and it sticks to areas of inflamed peritoneum. Such local omental adhesions may persist indefinitely.",

The severity of the clinical signs varies from slight weakness to quadriplegia, depending on the number and location of the wandering parasites; however, affected animals may remain bright and alert. The lesions produced are fundamentally traumatic; the inflammatory component is less conspicuous. A careful gross examination of brain and spinal cord may show the areas of damage as brown foci or streaks. These are more prominent as black spots in formalin-fixed tissue. The lesions are apt to be confined to relatively small foci, so it is important that the examination be made carefully and the material for microscopic examination taken from suspicious areas.
