            "text": "Drugs and drug delivery systems have to traverse multiple biological barriers to achieve therapeutic efficacy. In diseases of mucosal-associated tissues such as cystic fibrosis (CF), successful delivery of gene and drug therapies remains a significant challenge due to an abnormally concentrated viscoelastic mucus, which prevents ~99% of all drugs and particles from penetrating the mucus barrier and the underlying epithelia for effective therapy, resulting in decreased survival. We used combinatorial peptide-presenting phage libraries and nextgeneration sequencing to identify hydrophilic, close to net-neutral charged peptides that penetrate the mucus barrier ex vivo in sputum from CF patients with ~600-fold better penetration than a positively charged control. After mucus penetration, nanoparticles conjugated with our selected peptides successfully translocated into lung epithelial cells derived from CF patients and demonstrated up to three-fold improved cell uptake compared to non-modified carboxylated-and gold standard PEGylated-nanoparticles. The selected peptides act as surface chemistries with synergistic functions to significantly improve the ability of drug delivery systems to overcome the human mucosal barriers and provide efficient cellular internalization. Our screening strategy provides a biologically-based discovery assay that directly addresses transport through mucus and cell barriers and has the potential to advance drug and gene delivery to multiple mucosal barriers.",

One of the initial and primary barriers is the protective mucus layer lining the epithelia in the eyes, airways, gastrointestinal and cervicovaginal tracts [1] [2] [3] . Mucus is a complex biopolymer composed mainly of water, mucin glycoproteins, lipids, DNA, non-mucin proteins, salts, and cell debris [4] . The mucus layer acts as a transport barrier and can greatly hinder the diffusion of drugs, particles, and other molecules [5] [6] [7] via size filtering, mucociliary clearance, and intermolecular interactions, including electrostatic, hydrophobic, and/or other specific binding interactions [8] . For example in CF, the hyperconcentrated mucus layer traps foreign pathogens, resulting in chronic bacterial infections and concomitantly prevents up to 99% of drugs and particles from penetration needed for successful therapy [9, 10] . As a result, it is a long-standing challenge for drugs to permeate the mucus barrier and reach the underlying epithelia.",

It has been demonstrated that the use of net-neutral charge hydrophilic polymers can improve the transport of nanoparticles and minimize interactions with respiratory mucus [17, 20] , gastrointestinal mucus [21, 22] , and cervical mucus [23] [24] [25] .

Iteratively screening of peptide-presenting phage libraries is a powerful high-throughput method for identification of peptide coatings to a variety of targets with no known lead structures or substrates that can favorably interact with mucus for penetration and desired functionalities. The highly diverse libraries are collapsed to a few leads by performing repetitive rounds of selection against the target, or selection pressure (i.e. biopanning) [46, 47] .",

The na\u00efve phage library was amplified without any selection pressure for three rounds, and these samples were sequenced by high-throughput sequencing to identify overrepresented sequences indicative of fast growers. Selected peptide sequences from Table 1 were not amongst the overrepresented sequences present in the amplified rounds of the na\u00efve library.

However, these nanoparticles must overcome the transport barriers presented by both the mucus and cell surface.

However, this low-throughput sample size (20-100 clones) from traditional Sanger sequencing, while providing valuable information, presents a limited repertoire of the complete sequence space (less than 0.01% of available sequences), and as a result, it is likely that better performing peptides are not identified [53] . Second, the low copy display of peptides on the p3 coat of M13 (i.e. 5 copies versus 415 for T7) has a small surface area and does not allow for multiple interactions with the mucus substrate, which is needed to identify peptides that have desired weak but reversible interactions with mucus needed for penetrating transport [67] . Finally, while previous work focused on phage transport through reconstituted mucin, it is necessary to validate transport in sputum samples of CF patients; building insights from patient samples advances translational aspects in therapeutic applications of the mucus-and cell-penetrating peptide carriers.",

These findings suggest that mucus acts as a selection pressure for unique mucus-penetrating peptides after each round of screening. From selection, a small set of mostly hydrophilic and slightly negative or close to neutral net-charge peptide sequences were selected for subsequent transport studies in patient samples (Table 1) . Of interest, three of the four discovered peptides presented homology to human mucin proteins in a basic local alignment search tool (BLASTp) database search.

The changes in amino acid composition during selection can be attributed due to intermolecular interactions (or lack thereof) between peptide substrates with mucins present in mucus.

Patient 21 presented a greater barrier for phage permeation, which can be explained by the combination between higher solids, disulfide bonds, DNA, and mucin content with low porosities, imposing a challenging barrier for particles and molecules to diffuse through. These findings suggest that the properties governing diffusion of particles in sputum at the microscale are patient-dependent and not controlled only by the mucus composition alone. The permeation of molecules and particles in sputum are most likely governed by a combination of factors, including mesh size, mucin concentration, and physical entanglements between mucin fibers, DNA, and disulfide cross-linking [79] . Patient heterogeneity for CF samples has been previously reported in the literature, with sample variations even between the same patient intra-day, or within the same sample [80] , which suggests that CF sputum properties at the microscale are patient-specific.",

This could be partially attributed to the reduced size compared to the conjugated nanoparticles, since those were uncoated particles. While the addition of peptides and mPEG to carboxylated nanoparticles slightly increased the zeta-potential, the overall net-charge of all the particles remained negatively charged, which could affect diffusion of particles in CF sputum, as previously described. Nevertheless, our findings are in agreement with previous reports in the literature where 40% of uncoated carboxyl-modified polystyrene nanoparticles were able to diffuse in respiratory mucus; those results suggest that particles might be less adhesive to respiratory mucus than they are to cervical mucus, possibly due to interactions with endogenous surfactants present in the airway mucus [20] .",

Cellpenetrating peptides have recently demonstrated the potential to enhance the mucosal delivery of drugs and particles [84, 85] ; however these positively charged peptides form strong interactions with the negatively charged mucin glycoproteins, thereby hindering transport and actually, preventing their ability to achieve cell-penetration [86] . Furthermore, while promising, net-neutral charge polymers and polymer conjugates demonstrate improved mucus transport, they may face hindered cellular internalization and escape [16, [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [87] [88] [89] , thereby dampening the enthusiasm for their therapeutic use. Hence, we confirmed the ability of our peptides to achieve both mucus penetration and cellular internalization by measuring transport of the identified mucus-penetrating peptides conjugated to 100 nm nanoparticles in a co-culture assay of CF sputum and lung epithelial cells possessing the prevalent cystic fibrosis homozygous delta F508 mutation. In CF, the three basepair deletion of codon 508 (known as F508del) results in a loss of a phenylalanine residues on chromosome 7 and is the most common mutation amongst several identified CFTR mutations [90] , with approximately 70% prevalence worldwide [91] . From our transport studies, we found that select mucus-penetrating peptides not only improved the bulk diffusion of phage in CF sputum from patients ~600-fold more than a positively charged control phage clone but also achieved up to 3-fold significantly higher cell uptake of conjugated nanoparticles compared to non-modified carboxylated-and mPEG-conjugated nanoparticles. We also found that the PEG coating significantly decreased cell uptake of nanoparticles by up to 2-fold compared to mucus-penetrating peptides-and noncoated carboxylated nanoparticles. Collectively, these results indicate that the identified hydrophilic, net-neutral charge peptides that have sequence similarity to mucins successfully traverse the complex CF sputum barrier and improve intracellular uptake of conjugated nanoparticles to lung epithelial cells.",

Peptide frequencies over rounds of selection in 60 minutes eluates between two replicates; each point represents a peptide sequence. Heat map represents peptide sequences diversity (i.e. number of unique sequences). The frequencies of specific peptide sequences are reproducible between replicates over three rounds of selection and indicate a convergence of most frequent peptides over rounds, suggesting an enrichment for unique peptide sequences with desired properties (i.e. mucus penetrating).",

Age, gender, and any inhaled medications taken by the patients were recorded. Sputum samples with visible amounts of saliva were excluded from experiments. Biochemical characterization of CF sputum. The sputum of CF patients was characterized for solids content, mucin concentration, DNA concentration, and cystine content. Aliquots of individual sputum samples were pretreated with 20 U/mL of DNase I (NEB, MA) for subsequent fluorometric assays of mucin and DNA concentrations. Mucin concentration was determined by the reaction of 2-cyanoacetamide (Sigma Aldrich, MO) with O-linked glycoproteins of the mucin, as previously described [20, 79]. Briefly, sputum aliquots were diluted 20-fold and homogenized by vortexing for at least 30 minutes.
