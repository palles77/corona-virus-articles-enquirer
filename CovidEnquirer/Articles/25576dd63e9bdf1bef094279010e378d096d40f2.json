The National Interagency Confederation for Biological Research and collaborators rapidly produced and then evaluated anti-Ebola virus IgG immunoglobulins (collectively termed SAB-139) purified from Tc-bovine plasma after sequential hyperimmunization with an Ebola virus Makona isolate glycoprotein nanoparticle vaccine. SAB-139 was characterized by several in vitro production, research, and clinical level assays using wild-type Makona-C05 or recombinant virus/antigens from different Ebola virus variants. SAB-139 potently activates natural killer cells, monocytes, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells and has high-binding avidity demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance. SAB-139 has similar concentrations of galactose-\u03b1-1,3-galactose carbohydrates compared with human-derived intravenous Ig, and the IgG1 subclass antibody is predominant. All rhesus macaques infected with Ebola virus/H.sapiens-tc/GIN/2014/Makona-C05 and treated with sufficient SAB-139 at 1 day (n = 6) or 3 days (n = 6) postinfection survived versus 0% of controls. This study demonstrates that Tc-bovines can produce pathogen-specific human Ig to prevent and/or treat patients when an emerging infectious disease either threatens to or becomes an epidemic.",

However, traditional human-derived and heterologous animal-derived polyclonal immunoglobulins (Igs) and monoclonal antibodies can have lengthy development and/or clinical safety issues [1, 7, 8] . To address these shortcomings, genetically modified transchromosomic bovines (Tc-bovines) were developed that adaptively produce fully human polyclonal antibodies after exposure to environmental or vaccine antigens [9] [10] [11] [12] . After hyperimmunization, Tc-bovine fully human IgG (Tc-hIgG) can be rapidly produced from their plasma [13] [14] [15] [16] . Tc-bovines, depending upon age and size, produce 150 to 600 grams of purified Tc-hIgG per month. Experimental high-titer Tc-hIgGs were produced against several pathogens and demonstrated efficacy in animal models. In a recent study, 2 Tc-hIgG Investigational New Drug applications (ClinicalTrials.gov nos. NCT02788188 and NCT02508584) were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV) [17] and Mycoplasma hominis indications (termed SAB-301 and SAB-136, respectively). SAB-301 was safe and well tolerated in a completed phase I clinical trial with an average terminal IgG elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of ~28 days (d) that is similar to human-derived intravenous Ig (IVIG) [18] . SAB-136 was safe and efficacious in a phase I clinical trial that treated a patient with severe immunodeficiency, hypogammaglobinemia, and chronic M hominis septic hip and polyarthritis. The patient received SAB-136 for 1 year, and the drug was well tolerated with no significant adverse events and displayed and his clinical parameters improved with decreased mycoplasma burden [19] .",

Irrelevant Tc-hIgG did not induce human monocytes or neutrophils for ADMP, antibody-mediated neutrophil phagocytosis (ADNP) or activate NK cells (as measured by expression of CD107a and secretion of IFN-\u03b3 and MIP-1\u03b2 proteins after degranulation) above the background levels established with normal saline (Figure 1A-C) .

The titers of EBOV GP-specific total IgG and the IgG1 subclass antibodies isolated from bovine sera, SAB-139/V3-V4 (Lot 1) and SAB-139/ V6-V8 (Lot 3), were induced and sustained at high titers after V2 as determined by microsphere-based IgG methods [35] ( Figure 1D ). In contrast, the titers of EBOV GP-specific IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 subclass antibodies isolated from bovine sera, SAB-139/V3-V4 and SAB-139/V6-V8, were 10 to 1000 times lower than for total IgG and the IgG1 subclass. Although these titers peaked at V2, they generally declined after additional vaccinations ( Figure 1D ). Because the Fc fragment of different IgG-specific subclasses have varying affinity for cellular Fc receptors on effector cells [36] [37] [38] , we next determined whether the induction of multiple Fc-mediated effector functions (eg, ADMP/ADNP, cytokine expression, activation of NK cells) correlated with an EBOV-GP IgG-specific subclass. To determine whether total IgG or an IgG subclass was associated with a specific function, Spearman coefficients were used to determine correlation. The ADMP activity had a significant positive association with total EBOV GP-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3 but not IgG4, suggesting that ADMP activity is driven in part by antigen-specific antibody titer ( Figure 1A and E) . In contrast, neither ADNP nor NK cell degranulation/activation strongly correlated with any subclass, suggesting that the extent of induction of these functions is not solely based on antibody titer. To determine whether the ability of antibodies to induce a given function is associated with induction of other functions, correlation analyses were performed. Induction of ADMP activity did not strongly correlate with any other function (r s <0.5), yet ADNP activity and NK cell degranulation and activation displayed moderate-to-very strong positive correlations (r s \u2265 0.5) with each other (Figure 1B, C, and E) .",

The in vitro assays to assess SAB-139 included those potentially useful in the clinical setting for patient management (ELISA assay), in the research setting (pseudovirus, PRNT/FRNA, SPR, or effector cell assays), in the GMP production setting for quality control/release specifications (IgG subclass and SPR assays), or in the regulatory setting to address potential patient-safety issues (\u03b1-gal assay) before clinical testing. One consistent observation is that SAB-139/V6-V8 had a higher neutralization titer, total anti-EBOV antibodies, and avidity than SAB-139/V3-V4 in all assays regardless of whether the EBOV variant was homologous or heterologous. A likely explanation is that the affinity of Tc-bovine anti-EBOV IgG1 antibody clones continues to mature during the adaptive immune response after successive vaccinations that target both EBOV/Makona-specific epitopes and EBOV-conserved epitopes. This result likely indicates that Tc-hIgGs derived from plasma from later vaccinations are more potent than those derived from earlier vaccinations. Therefore, dosing of SAB-139 should be based upon the results of postproduction immunogenicity assays for each lot as correlated to future animal model and/or human efficacy observations.",

Results from the recently completed phase I clinical trial in healthy adults for SAB-301 (anti-MERS CoV) [18] indicated that it was well tolerated, but further studies in humans to determine safety and/or immunogenicity will be needed for SAB-139 and other Tc-hIgG products.",

For example, ADNP is initiated after IgG-immune complex Fc binding to the activating receptor Fc\u03b3-RIIIB [40] , which shares the same extracellular domain and therefore similar binding profiles to IgG as Fc\u03b3-RIIIA. In contrast, ADMP is driven through IgG-immunocomplex Fc binding to both the activating receptors Fc\u03b3-RIIA and Fc\u03b3-RIIIA [41] . Thus, differential binding of the SAB-139 IgG antibodies may be related to the differences in Fc-receptors used to drive ADNP and/or ADMP. Natural killer cells only express Fc\u03b3-RIIIA, and, similar to ADNP, activated NK cells degranulate (CD107a expression) [41, 42] and produce cytokines IFN-\u03b3 and the chemokine MIP-1\u03b2 to induce ADCC of infected cells. A growing body of evidence suggests that ADCC may contribute to the efficacy of some monoclonal antibodies against EBOV [43] [44] [45] , and both NK cells and monocytes have been implicated in protection against EBOV [46, 47] disease in NHP models.",

Therefore, SAB-139 should recruit innate immunity effector cells/activity in humans. In addition, the IgG1 subtype, a potent activator of ADCC, comprises 90% of SAB-139 compared with the typical range of 60%-70% in human-derived IVIG products [48] . The ability of IgG1 and/or IgG3 antibodies to induce multiple Fc-domain-mediated effector functions, termed polyfunctionality, has been associated with elite controllers of human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection. This polyfunctionality may have relevance to the efficacy of immunotherapeutics against EBOV and other viral agents [49, 50] . Therefore, SAB-139 may activate more global effector-cell responses in humans than is functionally possible from animal-derived IVIG (nonhuman Fc regions) or human-derived IVIG (proportionally less IgG1).",

More importantly, all infused doses of SAB-139 were well tolerated in all NHPs even when the animals were highly viremic. The results also indicate that low-dose, lower-potency SAB-139 (V3-V4) delivered 1 d after EBOV infection or higher dose, higher potency SAB-139 (V6-V8) delivered 5 d after EBOV infection provided limited or no protection. Of note, NHPs from the LI group were already highly viremic and had blood chemistry abnormalities before or at d 5 postinfection. Therefore, EBOV infection was advanced by the time Tc-hIgG therapy was initiated, and most NHPs succumbed within 2 d (d 7 postinfection) after treatment. Better survival may have been obtained had we delivered more of lower potency SAB-139/V3-V4 at d 1 postinfection or higher potency SAB-139/ V6-V8 at d 5 postinfection, respectively. Alternatively, a more compressed dosing schedule could be implemented up to and including single administration of the total planned dose on the first d of treatment to improve efficacy. However, although this dosing schedule may be practical in a human patient care scenario, administration of such a volume to sedated NHPs in a BSL4 setting was not practical due to time or logistical constraints.

Fatalities occurred in the EI group despite the presence of anti-EBOV GP antibodies at back-challenge and a history of transient anti-NP antibodies during the postprimary infection recovery phase. The mechanism(s) preventing adaptive immunity is not known. We conjecture that SAB-139 delivered 1 d, but not 3 d, after infection bound and masked the epitopes of EBOV GP antigen while also stimulating innate-immunity effector cells via Fc receptor binding causing the release of immunomodulating cytokines. This masking then prevented T and/or B cells from developing an adequate protective-adaptive immune response. However, further studies are needed to clarify the mechanism(s) of this observation.",
