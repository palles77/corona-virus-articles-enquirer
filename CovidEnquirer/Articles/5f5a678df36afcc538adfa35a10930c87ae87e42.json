This study attempted to determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of adult patients with respiratory infection by the coronavirus OC43, NL63 and 229E. Patients and methods: Between January 2013 and February 2014, we prospectively studied all patients with suspected clinical respiratory infection by taking throat swabs and performing a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in search of coronavirus. Results: In 48 cases (7.0% of the 686 enrolled patients; 12.6% of the 381 in whom a virus was detected) the presence of a coronavirus demonstrated. In 24 cases, the virus was OC43 (50%); in 14 cases, the virus was NL63 (29%); and in 10 cases, the virus was 229E (21%). The mean age was 54.5 years, with a slight predominance of men. The most common clinical presentations were nonspecific influenza symptoms (43.7%), pneumonia (29.2%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation (8.3%). Fifty-two percent of the patients required hospitalization, and 2 patients required intensive care. There were no deaths. Conclusion: Acute respiratory infections caused by coronavirus mainly affect middle-aged male smokers, who are often affected by previous diseases. The most common clinical picture has been nonspecific influenza symptoms.",

Pacientes y m\u00e9todos: Entre enero del 2013 y febrero del 2014 se estudi\u00f3 prospectivamente a todos los pacientes con sospecha cl\u00ednica de infecci\u00f3n respiratoria mediante la toma de un frotis far\u00edngeo y la realizaci\u00f3n de una reacci\u00f3n en cadena de la polimerasa en transcripci\u00f3n reversa en tiempo real en b\u00fasqueda de coronavirus.

Conclusi\u00f3n: Las infecciones respiratorias agudas causadas por coronavirus inciden preferentemente en varones fumadores en la edad media de la vida, frecuentemente afectados de enfermedades previas.

            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infections affect the general population. However, these infections have a higher incidence in the early and late ages of life and in immunosuppressed patients, in whom the infections can be more severe. 1 These respiratory infections are frequently caused by viruses, especially the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in children and the adenovirus and influenza viruses in adults. 2 However, the growing use of molecular diagnostic techniques has broadened the spectrum of viruses involved. 2, 3 Human coronaviruses are RNA viruses that taxonomically belong to the Coronavirinae subfamily and are classified into 3 distinct genera. The genus Alphacoronavirus includes the coronaviruses 229E and NL63, while the genus Betacoronavirus contains the coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1. 1 The latter genus also includes the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome 4 and the recently described MERS-CoV, which causes Middle East respiratory syndrome, although its definitive taxonomic position has not yet been established. 5 There are few studies that have focused on defining the virus' role in acute respiratory infections in adults, and those that have analyzed the role of the coronavirus are even scarcer. 2, 6 We therefore believe that our experience with this type of viral respiratory infection is of interest.",

These swabs were used as the only respiratory sample to avoid potential difficulties in the interpretation of the results based on the sample type. The throat swabs were sent to the laboratory in a viral transport medium (MTV, Vircell, Granada, Spain). Only one sample per patient was considered. The samples were processed to detect the various respiratory viruses using a real-time genomic amplification technique (commercial real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction kit), which provides simultaneous and differential detection of 16 different respiratory viruses (Anyplex RV16, Seegene, South Korea). Blood cultures were performed for patients with suspected pneumonia, and serological determinations for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae were conducted. The medical records and epidemiological data of the patients with coronavirus were reviewed. The statistical analysis was performed using the chi-squared test and Student's t-test for paired data.

However, in Brazil, these viruses only represented 1.2% of the cases studied from 2009 to 2010, 9 while in China, the rates were 4.4% 10 and 11.7% 11 for a pediatric population and an adult population, respectively. In a study performed in Canada, 12 coronaviruses only represented 2% of the respiratory samples from adults, which is consistent with that observed by Gaunt et al. 13 in Great Britain (2.3%). However, all of these estimates generally refer to the rate of positivity for a total number of samples analyzed. Thus for the Gaunt et al. study, 13 the rate of etiologic participation of the coronaviruses rose to 8.1% of all the samples positive to any virus. In our study, we detected coronaviruses in 6.9% of the enrolled patients and in 12.6% of those in whom a virus was demonstrated, with readings very close to those measured in neighboring countries, such as France. 8 The distribution of the various types of coronavirus varied widely according to the geographical area. Thus, while only NL63 and OC43 were detected in Brazil, 9 Lepiller et al. 8 observed a predominance in France of the coronavirus 229E (53%) compared to the others (36% for NL63 and 11% for OC43). However, Gaunt et al. 13 observed in their series of 221 cases in Edinburgh that the most common coronavirus was OC43 (50.2%), followed by NL63 (33.9%) and 229E (15.8%). In our study, which was shorter and had fewer cases of infections, the coronavirus OC43 (50%) was also predominant, followed by NL63 (29%) and 229E (21%).",

            "text": "One of the common characteristics of most respiratory viruses is that they usually cause mixed infections, in conjunction with other respiratory viruses. 14 The rates of coinfection vary from 30 to 70% 3,14 ; patients with mixed infections do not have higher rates of morbidity or mortality. 8, 13 The detection of probable mixed infections should be assessed with caution because they can reflect respiratory infections prior to the acute process that motivated the study. The simultaneous detection of several viruses through genomic tests also establishes the possibility that some patients are carriers of any of the detected viruses without them having a direct pathogenic role in the current infection. 3, 14 In our study, the rate of coinfection was not very high (25%). Gaunt et al. 13 reported a 35% coinfection rate, with rhinovirus the most frequent companions (65%); in our study, this virus represented 58.3%. Coinfections with the influenza virus have been described mainly in children, representing 5---10% of the cases. 10 Twenty-five percent of coinfection cases in our series corresponded to the influenza virus, probably coinciding with the seasonal flu epidemic. The detection of a case of RSV coinfection is noteworthy, given that a previous study on RSV did not detect any cases of this type of coinfection. 15 Although they can be detected over the course of the year, the incidence of coronavirus infections adjusts to a seasonal pattern, occurring predominantly in winter months. 2, 6, 13 A number of studies have observed that OC43 presents a pattern with a biannual variation, with a predominance in the first quarter of the year. 13, 16 We detected the incidence of respiratory infections by coronavirus over the course of the year, although the majority (58.3%) occurred between the months of January and March.",
