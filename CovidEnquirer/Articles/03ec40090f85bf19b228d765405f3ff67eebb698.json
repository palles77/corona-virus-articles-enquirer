Our approach captures the main topological and spatial changes from a complex network perspective. We find that the SAAN combines a relatively stable topological structure with a changing multilayered geographical structure. Statistical analysis indicates that the SAAN is a scale-free network with an increasing number of hub cities and has been characterized by small-world properties since 1996. Furthermore, the SAAN exhibits a recently intensified disassortative mixing pattern, suggesting an increasing dependence of small cities on hub-and-spoke configuration for better accessibility. A decomposition analysis is used to disaggregate the SAAN into a hierarchical core-bridge-periphery structure. The core layer consists of capital cities, the most economic vibrant secondary cities, and tourist destinations. This core layer is also densely interconnected with its center of gravity moving towards the north. The periphery layer, comprised of cities in remote areas, sustains a low significance with declining internal connectivity despite a rising number of cities being connected. The bridge layer lies in between both extremes, and is characterized by a high volatility over time. The connections and passengers between different layers increase, especially those between core and bridge after 1996. In our discussion, we trace these changes back to a series of socio-economic and politico-institutional dynamics in Southeast Asia.",

            "text": "Air transportation has emerged as a key facilitator of economic development and social change as it greatly enables the flow of people, goods, capital, and information across space. This is particularly true for Southeast Asia (SEA), one of the most economically dynamic and strategically significant regions in the global economy (Sien, 2003) . In 2015, SEA, which is commonly defined as including Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam (CLMV), Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, Brunei, and East Timor (formerly part of Indonesia) (cf. Rimmer and Dick, 2009) , ranked third in Asia both in terms of its population of 633 million inhabitants (following China and India) and in terms of its economic size with a combined gross domestic product (GDP) of US$2.45 trillion (following China and Japan) (ASEAN Secretariat, 2016) . Important from the perspective of air transport, the region is much more geographically fragmented than, say, the European Union (EU) and North America. The archipelagic geography, further complicated by often-difficult terrain to cross in climatic and physiographic terms, endows air transportation with competitive advantages over road, rail, and water transportation (Zhang et al., 2008) . Or, as O'Connor (1995: 270) has pointed out: \"air transportation is the only effective means for intercity links\" in this region. For example, an express coach covering the 250 km trip from Ho Chi Minh City to Phnom Penh takes at least 5.5 h, whereas the flying time is only 45 min. Meanwhile, travelling by rail from Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur takes about 24 h compared to a 2-h flight. Similarly, a ferry trip between Singapore and Jakarta via Batam can last 26 h while a flight takes < 2 h. As a consequence, the importance of developing efficient and extensive air transport networks has been highlighted in various regional and national policy agendas (ASEAN Secretariat, 2011) .",

However, to date there has been no effort to engage in systematic complex-network analysis of the Southeast Asian air transport network (SAAN). Such a complex network approach has been shown to provide new insights into air transport systems at national (e.g., China; Wang et al., 2011) , macro-regional (e.g., the EU; Zanin and Lillo, 2013) , and global (e.g., Guimera et al., 2005) scales. An analysis of the SAAN may or may not reach similar conclusions, as it entails very different sets of underlying geographic, institutional, and socioeconomic factors (Lordan and Sallan, 2017) . To help filling this gap, in this paper we explore the structural evolution of the SAAN during 1979-2012 from a complex network perspective.",

Taylor et al., 2013) . Indeed, the 'openness' of SEA is clearly visible in the possible extension of the system to Hong Kong (Dick, 2005) , or in the identified functional airline region by including neighboring China and Japan (Guimera et al., 2005) . However, there has been no consensus on how closed a transport or urban system should be to make a regional framing tenable (Kratoska et al., 2005) , while the liberalization/deregulation geography as circumscribed by the move towards open skies in the in the context of ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) and ASEAN Single Aviation Market (ASAM) does lend the region a certain coherence in this context (Liu et al., 2017; Thompson, 2013) .

First, we conduct a statistical analysis to characterize the evolving topological structure of the SAAN over this 34-year period and compare the network metrics with some other major regional blocs. Second, a decomposition technique is employed to unveil the multilayered structure of the SAAN for the years 1979, 1996 and 2012, respectively. By doing so, we shed light on how the topological and geospatial architecture of the SAAN changes over time. To this end, the remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the literature, focusing on the application of complex network theory in the study of the geography of air transport networks. This is followed by a discussion of our methodological framework and data in Section 3. Section 4, then, presents the results of the complex network analysis of SAAN, after which the paper is concluded with an overview of our major findings, the limitations of our approach, and some avenues for further research.",

            "text": "2.1. A growing air transport market in the context of regional integration Southeast Asian countries have very different experiences with regional integration. It is well documented that regional economic integration in East Asia -including a large part of its Southeast Asian component -has been preceded by fast-paced industrial development in Japan and the emergence of newly industrializing countries (NICs) -South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore -since the mid-1960s (Yap, 2014) . Consecutive waves of relocating labour-intensive industries then cascaded down to next-tier NICs -Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand -and later to the Philippines after it introduced a transition towards more liberal economic policies from the early 1980s onwards (Coclanis and Doshi, 2000) . Meanwhile, the three Indochinese economies (i.e. Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia) were trapped in conflicts and isolated from the SEA regional market for more than a decade after 1975. They subsequently embarked on a trajectory of regional economic integration through a fundamental shift in development strategy from a centrally planned economy to a market economy since the late 1980s, as exemplified by Vietnam's Doi Moi reforms (Hill and Menon, 2012) . By 1993, CLMV countries had all embraced market mechanisms, emphasizing export promotion, welcoming foreign investment, and promoting tourism (Thant, 2012) . The flows of trade and investment to these newcomers to regional integration led to the establishment of broader regional production networks. As a consequence, regional integration in SEA has been significantly accelerating since the early 1990s: Tanaka (2009) demonstrates that the intraregional trade has almost doubled over the past two decades and now constitutes a quarter of the region's total trade.",

Since the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was founded in 1967, it has facilitated both improved regional economic integration and air transport connectivity, seeing both as being fundamentally intertwined. A key step was the agreement on an ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) in 1992. The AFTA framework carried a commitment to further enhance regional cooperation by providing safe, efficient and innovative transportation and communications infrastructure networks. This boosted a series of subregional air liberalization initiatives, such as a joint agreement by Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand in 1994 to promote the development of air transport in ASEAN's Northern Growth Triangle. The agreement was later broadened to include the Philippines and Brunei, and was supplemented with a similar CLMV cooperation in 1998, which liberalized air transport between the four countries. Another important step was the 2003 agreement to building the AEC by 2015 in order to move SEA towards an integrated and globally competitive single market and production base. Under this umbrella, Southeast Asian governments have been engaged in concerted efforts to work out an open skies policy similar to the one realized in the EU, namely the ASAM. Against this background, the airline industry in SEA has been evolving from an assortment of individual and highly-protected companies into an increasingly integrated and liberalized system of regional business organizations.",

In line with booming regional economic output and surpassing overall population growth, the total volume of scheduled air passenger traffic within SEA has increased dramatically from 23.9 million in 1979 to 234.9 million in 2012 ( Fig. 1) . , 1979-2012 (Scheduled air passenger traffic from 1979 to 2012 was compiled from the OAG database. GDP and population data for each of the eleven Southeast Asian countries were gathered from World Bank (https://data.worldbank.org/). Since the World Bank GDP data of CLMV countries were incomplete, they were crosschecked and supplemented by data from http://ivanstat.com. Data from both sources were counted in current U.S. dollars (at 2015 prices). There was no GDP information for East Timor before 1999, since it was part of Indonesia. This confirmed the necessity to include it in our longitudinal study to keep geographic and statistical consistency although it has not become a formal ASEAN member yet.). The data in 1979 were standardized as 100 and those in other years were scaled according to this benchmark. These evolutions have drawn considerable attention from air transport geographers. One the one hand, transport geographers have been interested in the positionality of cities and the (geo)spatial patterns of linkages between them, as well as their complex associations with economy, tourism, state policies, etc. For example, Bowen (2000) examined the changes in nodal accessibility of Southeast Asian hubs during 1979-1997 and assessed how different state policies and strategies shaped the development of air transport networks. Rimmer (2000) analyzed the impacts of the Asian Crisis on the geography of ex/ intra-SEA air traffic with particular attention to changes in city-pair routes. On the other hand, researchers have discussed the mixed blessings of deregulation/privatization trends and emerging open skies policies for the Southeast Asian aviation market with regard to airports/ cities, carriers, and air routes (Forsyth et al., 2006; Hooper, 2005) .",

However, there is relatively limited insight into the structural changes of and in the network. An exception is O'Connor's (1995) elaboration of a four-stage model of the historical development of the SAAN. He states that the network begins with \"major destinations and trunk route stops\" due to colonialism; then bypassing some places to exhibit \"new intermediate conditions\" with the development of national/regional economies and the advancement of aircraft technology; then entering into the \"international hub development and proximity\" stage by concentration of feeder connections from small cities; followed by the final \"principal axis shift\" from the traditional west-east to a north-south orientation with an increased vitality of southern cities. Complementing O'Connor's classical spatial analysis, here we attempt to uncover the evolution of overall SAAN structures through complex network analysis, which could provide insights into the network topological structure and multilayered geographical structure.",

Obviously, air transport networks are neither simply random or regular. Therefore, a complex network analysis of their structures starts with topological characterization and pattern recognition, with particular reference to scale-free and smallworld networks. A scale-free network is characterized by a power-law distribution of nodal degree (i.e., a node's number of adjacent neighbors), showing that a few large degree nodes dominate a large number of less connected nodes (Barab\u00e1si and Albert, 1999) . In comparison, a small-world network has a larger density of edges because of a shorter average/characteristic path length (i.e., the average number of edges in the shortest path between two nodes) and higher transitivity (i.e., probability for a node to have its neighbors interconnected) than a random network of the same size (Watts and Strogatz, 1998) .",

In general, these studies examine overall network structures as well as indices for individual nodes, after which the implications of the network analysis results are explored. The presence of scale-free properties is related to the existing literature on hub-and-spoke configurations (O'Kelly, 1998) . Nonetheless, the degree distribution can be very distinct in different air transportation systems, as can the shape of the distribution ranging from (stretched) exponential to power law (with or without cutoff), to two-regime/double power law (cf. Reed, 2003) . Against the backdrop of this diversity, Paleari et al. (2010) compared the structure of air transport networks in the US, EU and China. The results showed that all three airport systems are characterized by a double Pareto-law (i.e. a two-regime power law) degree distribution, but with the distribution declining more rapidly in the EU. Overall, 'small-worldiness' is more universal in non-planar networks (i.e. networks that allow links to cross without creating a node at the intersection) due to the existence of communities, a set of nodes sharing denser connections with each other than with the rest of the network.",

However, with the growing availability of coherent longitudinal datasets, several studies focus on the historical evolution of air transport networks. For instance, Wandelt and Sun's (2015) analysis of international air transport networks from 2002 to 2013 indicated that the scale-free and small-world properties were stable and the network shifted towards symmetric, transitive closure due to the increasing interconnection between each country's neighbors. Burghouwt and Hakfoort (2001) explored the evolution of the European aviation network during 1990-1998, and demonstrated the development of huband-spoke structures notwithstanding there being no evidence for concentration of intra-European traffic on the primary hubs. Lin and Ban (2014) studied both topological and spatial characteristics of the US airline network during 1990-2010, finding stability in topology and an increasing importance of distance in the development of new routes. That is, more and more short-and medium-length (< 700 km) routes have been created, and passengers increasingly need one or more transfers to realize a long-distance connection due to network structure optimization and integration. The evolution of the Chinese air transport network since 1930 was examined in Wang et al. (2014) , indicating a significant improvement of connectivity and a gradual expansion of a core network along with the development of China's economy (cf. Liu et al., 2016) . Rocha (2009) discovered a relatively high and stable clustering coefficient and a slightly declining average path length for the Brazilian airport network, as well as a shrinkage of network routes in spite of a more than doubling of air traffic between 1995 and 2006.",

These authors employ the k-core decomposition method to uncover the multilevel structure of the worldwide, Chinese, and European air transport networks, respectively. K-core decomposition is a technique to hierarchically identify particular subsets of a complex network, called kcores, in which the degree of every node is larger than or equal to k. Each subset is obtained by recursively removing all nodes with degree smaller than a certain threshold k (Ducruet and Zaidi, 2012) . This approach progressively disentangles the complexity of airline networks, thus providing insight into the different layers unevenly contributing to the configuration of the network. Because, as we will see, the SAAN exhibits both high complexity and spatial inequality, such a multilayer analysis is of the utmost interest to help grasping the geographies of the network.",

First, air transport networks have been widely analyzed in terms of the statistical properties of the network structure. However, these studies have primarily focused on the US, European countries, China, and India: the SAAN thus appears under-researched from this perspective. Second, most studies examine the static state of the network in a single year through the lens of complex network theory: longitudinal analysis could help revealing underlying geographic, political and economic factors in the structuration of the network. Third, multilayer/multilevel analysis has evolved into a prominent approach to discover hidden information and extract hierarchical structures from complex networks. However, this approach has not yet been widely adopted in research on air transport networks. Against this backdrop, this paper examines the evolving structure of the SAAN from 1979 to 2012 by means of multilevel complex network analysis, and discusses these with key social and economic changes in the region. In the next section, we will elaborate on the methodology and data used in this study.",

Bowen, 2000) .

(2014) , nodes in the air transport network can be categorized into three distinct layers: core, bridge and periphery. The core layer contains the nodes belonging to the k max -core while the periphery layer includes the nodes in the 1-core; the remainder of the network forms the bridge layer.

            "text": "As can be seen in Fig. 3 , the SAAN's P(> k) fits a power-law function with a scaling exponent of \u03b3 cum = 1.42 in 2012. Therefore, the corresponding exponent \u03b3 for P(k) is 1 + 1.42 = 2.42. Given that this is in the range of 2 < \u03b3 < 3, this characterizes the SAAN as a scale-free network as previously observed for India and Austria as well as, to a lesser extent, for the global level and the US, the EU and Italy (cf. Table 1 ). This confirms our first hypothesis regarding the dominance of a few well-connected cities (hubs) in SEA with a large number of air passenger routes (cf. Bowen, 2000) . The shape of the distribution remains roughly similar between 1979 and 2012, implying that even with strong rewiring at the micro level (see Section 4.2), the overall characteristics of the network have remained roughly the same. Nevertheless, the slope of the degree distribution generally decreased (Fig. 4) , meaning that there are relatively more cities with a large degree. This is above all the result of the recent emergence of Indochina and the continued expansion of Thai, Malaysian and Indonesian cities as indicated in O'Connor (1995) . The minor deviations in some of the years may be attributed to the sensitivity of air transport to sudden events, such as the outbreak of economic crisis in 1997 and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 (Bowen and Laroe, 2006; Rimmer, 2000) . Fig. 5 demonstrates the presence of a negative correlation between a city's degree and the average degree of its neighboring cities for the SAAN in 2012. This points to a disassortative mixing pattern in which high-degree cities such as Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Jakarta and Manila on average have relatively low-degree neighbors. Cebu is an outlier here in that, as a medium-sized city, its average neighbor degree is less than half of the expected value. This can be ascribed to a 'shadow effect ' (cf. O'Connor, 1995) of its major hub, Manila, which confines Cebu's connections to domestic small cities instead of major cities in other countries. In contrast, Singapore neighbors' average degree is higher than expected. This suggests that it is directly connected to many primate cities and secondary cities in other countries, compensating for the relatively smaller number of connections with low-degree cities. Fig. 6 shows disassortativity to be slowly declining from \u22120.14 in 1979 to \u22120.01 in 1995 (pointing to an almost neutral mixing pattern). Since 1995, however, disassortativity has again roughly intensified, although the mixing pattern in 2012 is still not very strong. The two stages identified here are the joint result of a changing diversity of pairs of connected cities and the partial hierarchical structure (Ru and Xu, 2005) . The growing importance of air transport and the integration of more remote local cities into the national and regional development process implies that small cities increasingly rely on hub-and-spoke configurations to attain better accessibility in SEA (Lin, 2012) . Fig. 7 . presents the characteristic path length and average clustering coefficient of the SAAN and a comparable network (i.e. with the same number of edges and nodes) with a random distribution. In the case of the SAAN, L is very close to that of a random network with a turning point in 1996 when the random network's L starts surpassing that of the SAAN. The clustering coefficient is nevertheless continuously significantly higher than that of a comparable random network. Hence, the SAAN exhibits small-world properties from 1996 onwards. One possible explanation for this is that major Low-Cost Carriers (LCCs) came into SAAN, 1979 SAAN, -2012 focus after 1996, such as Cebu Pacific, Lion Air, AirAsia, Jetstar Asia (Zhang et al., 2008) , which has greatly densified the overall intercity air transport network and improved the accessibility of many secondary cities in this region.",

Compared with other regions in Table 1 , the SAAN has a large characteristic path length of 3.12 whereas the worldwide network has a larger value at 4.4. It can of course be hypothesized that L will increase with the scale of the networks because distance and border effects still matter in air transport networks (Matsumoto, 2007) .

As can be seen in Fig. 8 , the core layer has evolved into a well-developed and tightly connected backbone with the gravitational center moving towards the northern part of SEA. This tendency is in line with O'Connor (1995) \"principal axis shift\". In 1979, the 23 core cities were capital cities of economically developed countries alongside a number of large cities in archipelagic countries (i.e. Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia). The core layer had 68 connections connecting 13.85 million passengers. However, the number of core cities in 1996 was almost halved, while the connections between them also decreased to 45 whereas the number of air passengers more than doubled. Cities that remained in the core layer were capital cities of economically developed countries, provincial capitals of East Malay (Kuching and Kota Kinabalu), as well as the second largest city (Surabaya), the most well-developed tourist destination (Denpasar) and the busy domestic hub of Makassar in Indonesia. After a further 17 years, the core layer witnessed a moderate growth in size (18 cities and 87 connections) and a drastic rise in the number of passengers (85.13 million). The layer includes all capital cities of the SEA region except for Vientiane, a number of critical secondary cities and international gateways (i.e. Penang, Surabaya, Medan), as well as the region's important tourist destinations (i.e. Phuket, Siem Reap and Denpasar).",

Initially, the connections between bridge cities were relatively sparse. Air passenger flows were concentrated in the remote parts of East Indonesia around Makassar on the one hand, and a Northwest Burmese group around Yangon on the other hand. The layer mushroomed in 1996 with connections and traffic more than doubling and quadrupling respectively. This is largely due to the emergence of Vietnamese cities as well as a number of Indonesian and Philippine cities that were downgraded from the core layer. In 2012, the number of cities and connections respectively shrank by 12.5% and 32.2%. It is noteworthy that Chiang Mai and Da Nang became prominent bridge cities in the Greater-Mekong sub-region in the face of the rise of Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi and Yangon to the core layer. Besides, Makassar reappeared in this layer after 1996's temporary upgrade into a core city, with the connections between the divided parts of Malaysia being much denser in 2012.",

In a similar vein, the connections between bridge and core layers ascended drastically from 92 to 251, with a parallel growth in air traffic from 5.88 to 114.29 million.

First and foremost, the region's fragmented geographical nature continues shaping the spatial and topological patterns. For instance, especially for remote areas with small population and economic output, Makassar acts as a local hub in Indonesia to handle frequent air links from densely-populated Java to Sulawesi and Irian Java. Given that the Malaysian communities on Borneo are both relatively less developed and isolated from the Malay Peninsula, intense air connections are established to numerous cities in East Malaysia (often through Kuching and Kota Kinabalu). This geographical dispersion of archipelagic countries has placed an unusual dependence on air services as a unifying force to keep the national development project on track (Kissling, 1989) .",

One the one hand, the early NICs, being export-oriented, started to integrate into the global economy, thus reinforcing the significance of their respective international hubs by synergies of soft (e.g. information, telecommunication) and hard (e.g. airport, port, rail and road) infrastructures (Airriess, 2001; Rimmer, 1999; Robinson, 2006) . For instance, with the development of high tech and value-added manufacturing and business services, Singapore has become one of the major investors in other Southeast Asian countries. Therefore, it has geared its soft (e.g. management and amenities) and hard (e.g. new airport terminals) infrastructures (Phang, 2003) towards attracting layover passengers during long-haul inter-continental flights. On the other hand, the lagging CLMV got involved into the regional production network by economic reforms from the late 1980s and joined ASEAN later on (Vietnam in 1995 , Laos and Myanmar in 1997 , and Cambodia in 1999 . In Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi and Da Nang were designated as three development poles and have enjoyed rapid economic growth from a small base, which spurs investment in air transport connections to external economies. In addition, the CLMV subregional cooperation in air transport since 1998 contributes to an improved competitiveness and gradual participation in the international air transport market (Hien, 2003) , ultimately bolstering the capital cities of CLMV in the core layer in 2012. An equally important contributor has been the growing volumes in tourism (Van De Vijver et al., 2014) . This shift leads to mushrooming air connections to Siem Reap (the world heritage site of Angkor Wat), and Phuket and Denpasar (resort islands), all of which are also included in the core layer in 2012.",

Before the 1990s, air services were overwhelmingly state-regulated or even state-operated in SEA. National carriers played an instrumental role the processes of nation-building, serving to integrate various parts of a country on the one hand and reinforcing the positionality of the national capital cities on the other hand (Raguraman, 1997) . Partly in order to cope with the rapid growth of air transport demand, most SEA countries started to permit the entry of private corporations into the aviation industry (Hooper, 2005) , while flagship carriers shifted towards regional and international cooperation and competition. The gradual deregulation of domestic markets promoted joint-venture LCCs, such as Malaysia's AirAsia which is perceived to be a pan-ASEAN carrier (Zhang et al., 2008) . The connections provided by these carriers greatly enhanced the nodal accessibility of most economically vibrant secondary cities and tourism destinations as pronounced in the core layers of 1996 and 2012.",

The emergence of Johor Bahru in the SAAN can be ascribed to the 'spillover effect' of Singapore owing to geographic proximity (Ooi, 1995) as well as its potential to be the secondary airport of Singapore with convenient ground transportation between both places. A similar observation can be made for Clark, an airport city 80 km away from Manila, which is increasingly well connected by its attraction of connectivity from congested Manila airport (Hanaoka et al., 2014) . In our empirical framework, we initially opted to aggregate these airports into 'city nodes', but these findings suggest that a more nuanced reading of connectivity in a city-regional context would have been warranted. This is, of course, in line with Addie's (2014) coining of the concept of aero-regionalism to enhance and reshape our understanding of the relations between aviation infrastructures and their surrounding regional spaces.",

It follows a power-law degree distribution, suggesting scale-free properties as previously observed for air transport networks in India, Austria and, to a lesser extent, in the global, US, EU and Italian networks. The slope of the degree distribution generally decreased, indicating more cities now having a large degree. This is largely due to the emerging hubs in CLMV countries. Meanwhile, the SAAN has been characterized by small-world properties since 1996 when its characteristic path length and average clustering coefficient were both above values of a comparable random network. Furthermore, the SAAN exhibits an intensified disassortativity, showing an increasing dependence of small cities on a hub-and-spoke configuration to access the entire network. However, compared to its EU macro-regional counterpart, the SAAN is far from mature and integrated.",

            "text": "The multilayered structure of the SAAN has changed over time and space, which can be traced back to a range of socio-economic and politico-institutional dynamics. The tourism boom has resulted in the entry of Phuket, Siem Reap and Denpasar into the core layer. And because of the more recent economic development of CLMV, the core layer is now shifting towards the northern part of SEA. Our analysis shows a prominent increase in connections and traffic between the core and other layers. Although more remote cities are integrated into the SAAN, connections between peripheral cities remain almost non-existent, which again suggests an increasing dependence of small cities on hub-and-spoke configuration to access the network. There are, of course, a number of limitations associated with our approach. Our binary (as opposed to a weighted) specification of connections implies that we have focused on the major topological features of the SAAN, but this may result in losing sight on some of the nuances engendered in the edges being unevenly weighted. In addition, our study sheds light on the evolving structure of the SAAN from the perspective of air transport capacity/supply; it would also be interesting to conduct empirical studies from a demand dimension. Our analysis also has its data limitations. First, the network we analyzed is an aggregated one that does not differentiate between types of carriers (i.e. Full Service Carrier and LCCs) and airline companies (e.g. Tiger Airways, AirAsia, Jetstar). Second, the rise and fall of cities in these networks may mesh with changes in other modes of transportation, such as port and railway development, which cannot be identified in our study. With more refined and multiplex data, an improvement in these aspects would provide a more accurate understanding of the structural evolution in terms of development strategies and policies for cities and the air transport industry. And finally, our all-too-straightforward definition of what constitutes a node could be conceptually enriched by triangulating it with research on the diversity of the meaning of airport-cities and airport-regions as per Addie (2014) and Derudder et al. (2010) .",
