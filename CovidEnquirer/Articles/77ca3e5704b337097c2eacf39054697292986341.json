Methods: We conducted a retrospective study in patients who visited the ED of a large hospital in Hong Kong from . We estimated waiting and length of stay (LOS) for individual non-emergent patients registered during day and evening shifts.

            "text": "Waiting time and length of stay (LOS) are two measures commonly used to evaluate the quality of emergency services. A substantial amount of research has been dedicated to identifying factors that contribute to patient LOS in Emergency Departments (EDs) (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . Apart from the patient demographics (e.g., age, sex, race, mode of arrival, insurance status) and clinical factors (e.g., chief complaint, triage category), LOS is highly dependent on factors that are either at the ED or hospital level (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . The former includes disposition status, patient census, and bed occupancy rate, whereas the latter includes hospital census and inpatient bed occupancy rate (3, 4, (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . Similarly, waiting times are another key indicator of ED performance, and prolonged waiting times can increase the risk of health (1, 6, 11, 12) . Although there have been a few studies regarding the effect of non-urgent patients on crowding in the ED, little is known about how emergent patients affect crowding and the consequent service delay to the majority of non-emergent patients in the ED (12) . This is particularly pertinent in the era of increased performance measurement (and potentially reimbursement) of emergency-specific quality metrics globally (such as in the United States (US), the United Kingdom, and parts of Australia, New Zealand, and Canada) and locally in Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, the Hospital Authority has set waiting time targets for patients since 1999, and thus has created intense pressure on health systems to meet these targets (13) .",

Category I is considered critical; Category II emergency; Category III urgent; Category IV semi-urgent; and Category V non-urgent. Essentially, Categories I and II are considered emergent and Categories III-V non-emergent. A&Es are mandated to comply with waiting times determined by the Hospital Authority, which are determined separately for different categories. In Hong Kong's system, most emergent patients are immediately placed in the resuscitation room upon arrival and undergo continuous close monitoring. The emergent patients account for <4% of total ED patients, much less than in the US. In the study A&E, the percentage of critical, emergency, and urgent patients first seen by a medical officer within the recommended time were 100%, 96.8%, and 91.2%, respectively. However, only 67% of semi-urgent patients were seen within 120 min, in contrast to the 75% recommendation (the waiting time target for semi-urgent patients is unofficial There is no target set for non-urgent patients, as they are discouraged from attending A&Es. A typical A&E in Hong Kong is divided into resuscitation rooms where critical and emergency patients are managed, cubicles for patients on gurneys who are mostly urgent, and walk-in clinics where semi-urgent and nonurgent patients are consulted. Non-urgent patients are normally seen 30 min later than semi-urgent patients. There is a fast-track stream for semi-urgent patients with minor injury between 7:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. through which they can jump in front of other semiurgent patients who have arrived earlier. Emergent patients are managed by a resuscitation team consisting of one to two medical officers and two to three nurses. All non-emergent patients are consulted by one medical officer, including non-urgent patients who only need brief check-ups.",

Second, we calculated the median waiting time and LOS, and performed basic descriptive analysis of patient characteristics. Third, we used multiple linear regression to estimate the average waiting time and LOS of individual non-emergency patients to reflect levels of crowding with patient volume upon arrivals. Finally, we assessed the specific associations between the violation of the 120-min waiting time target of semi-urgent patients and the explanatory variables using logistic regression. Odds ratios (ORs) were used to represent the strength of the associations. We adopted the same explanatory variables as in the first analysis. Based on the model, we determined the discriminatory power of forecasting violation cases from the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC [AUC]), where a value of 1.0 represents perfect discrimination and a value of 0.5 represents no discrimination.

The median waiting time and LOS for all patients was 34 min and 112 min, respectively. In general, patients over 65 years old, brought in by ambulance, and admitted, experienced shorter waiting time and LOS than their complementary counterparts. There was no significant variation between genders. Table 3 displays the contribution of patient demographics, clinical factors, crowding factors, and emergent patients on the waiting times of non-emergent patients. Patients who had lower acuity had higher waiting times, and patients who arrived by ambulance and were admitted had significantly lower waiting times, as most of those patients were triaged to Category I-III. The more important finding shown in this table is that emergent patients prolonged a non-emergent patient's waiting time by 14 Service Delay for Non-emergent ED Patients Table 4 presents the results of the multiple linear regression model estimating LOS. Longer LOS were found among elderly patients because they usually underwent further observation after testing and treatment. Patients brought in by ambulance and those admitted had a shorter LOS. This model also shows that emergent patients prolonged a non-emergency patient's LOS by 10.8% (95% CI 10.6-11.0). In other words, given that the median LOS for non-emergent patients was 118 min and the average number of emergent patients arriving during their visit was 1.4, this would increase the waiting time to 16.8 min. Overall, the volume of the earlier arrived patients in different phases of care prolonged a newly arrived patient's LOS except for the negative impact imposed by non-urgent patients in treatment (\u00c00.6, 95% CI \u00c00.9 to \u00c00.2). The patient attributes were significantly associated with the LOS. For example, patients in higher categories stayed longer in the A&E, whereas those brought by ambulance and finally being admitted stayed shorter because most of them suffered from major conditions that require less waiting before the first consultation. Table 5 displays the results of the secondary aim of this study, to determine if emergent patients increase the probability of violating the 120-min waiting time target for semi-urgent patients. The logistic regression model shows that the presence of each additional emergent patient predicted a higher likelihood of violation of the mandate (OR 2.31, 95% CI 2.18-2.45). The subsequent ROC curve demonstrated good discriminative power of a 0.889 (95% CI 0.880-0.898) AUC value, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test provided no evidence of rejecting the model (p > 0.05).",

In addition, the results demonstrate moderate predictive ability of the imminent violation of the 120-min waiting time target for semi-urgent patients. There is high face validity for our results, including the finding that nonurgent patients who could potentially seek primary care in outpatient clinics only underwent brief check-ups in the A&E (most of them only came in the early mornings to collect sick notes). A greater proportion of non-urgent Tables 3  and 4 . The overflow of non-emergent patients engenders the question of how to adequately provide timely care that meets governmental mandates (instituted for the purposes of measuring and improving quality) in A&E service in the context of limited ability to provide adequate service in alternative settings (16, 21, 22) . Although the existing triage categories hardly discriminate the true A&E cases from others that could be managed by primary care facilities, two local studies have found that as much as 57% of the total A&E cases could actually be handled by general practitioners (21, 23) . In fact, our semi-urgent and non-urgent patients are the group most vulnerable to the arrival of emergency patients when staff are reallocated to secure the service targets of urgent patients first. Although there are many reasons for patient preferences to seek care in the A&E rather than general outpatient clinics (e.g., a perception of more ''professional'' service in A&Es, insufficient primary care services, long appointment time for specialist services), there is a push to improve quality by the provision of timely care (16) . Although many other countries may not yet experience this pressure as intensely as Hong Kong, it is not implausible to consider that, given major shifts in health care reform, similar situations will arise in many other parts of the world where Emergency Medicine has rapidly developed.",

            "text": "This research opens up a wide discussion of health care service improvement in Hong Kong and, potentially, elsewhere. Although non-emergency A&E visits have slightly decreased in recent years due to situational factors such as the deterrent of severe acute respiratory syndrome and policy-related factors such as the implementation of emergency fees, this trend has been offset by dwindling A&E personnel and more complexity of the case-mix (15, (24) (25) (26) . Several immediate measures, such as relinquishing treatment of the semi-and nonurgent patients to nurses and opening parallel ambulatory clinics next to A&Es, could be more widely adopted (20, 27) . Although there are no laws that forbid turning away patients or diverting ambulances to other A&Es, morality and ethical concerns preclude such measures as policy (12, 28) . However, the Hong Kong government is considering an expansion of public and private primary care services, such as 24/7 and Sunday/Holiday clinics, and also extending primary care services in private clinics. At the same time, the government may enhance public health education through mass media and communities to prevent inappropriate A&E visits. Nevertheless, even widespread adoption of these measures would be insufficient to address the level of crowding in Hong Kong A&Es, and if hospitals are required to comply with governmental mandates regarding waiting time and LOS targets for patient care, additional nurses and medical officers in walk-in clinics would be crucial to buffer the burden of resuscitating emergent patients. The optimal staffing level in an A&E relies on the calculation of time-varying patient demands and the A&E capacity. Previous papers have studied the application of the time-series method, queuing theory, and discrete event simulation to determine the optimal staffing level (29) (30) (31) . These advances in application of such methods for streamlining A&E processes of care could be applied in many systems and countries.",

            "text": "There are several limitations to this study. First, the study was conducted in a single hospital in Hong Kong, which has its own set of demographic and system-level factors related to input, throughput, and output of the A&E. As mentioned previously, in Hong Kong, A&Es in general Service Delay for Non-emergent ED Patients function similarly to a combination of primary and urgent care centers, along with emergency, due to the need for health care services by an enormous population. Therefore, the results of this study may not be easily generalized to other regions' A&E settings (32) . Second, although the triage system used in our study is based on a five-point scale similar to many other countries, ours is not precisely the ESI, and therefore does not capture triage patterns for each point of the scale in the same way as when the ESI system was adopted (32) (33) (34) (35) . Specifically, in those studies done with ESI, there was a higher proportion of Category II cases (over 28%) and a lower proportion of Category IV cases (below 30%), whereas the corresponding figures are 4.0% and 49.3%, respectively, in this study. The very few Category II cases reflects the fundamental difference in triage systems, that is, that Hong Kong's system has rigorously defined Category II patients, many of whom would be placed in Category I in many other systems. On the other hand, we suspect the disproportionately large number of Category IV patients was partly due to our A&E staff's reluctance to triage patients to Category III, in which the recommended waiting time is much shorter. This disparity between the numbers of emergency and non-emergency patients has also been identified in other local studies (16, 24, 31) . At the same time, we believe that our main finding, that sicker patients of higher acuity significantly impact our ability to deliver care in a timely fashion to the lower acuity patients, is applicable in many other contexts.",
