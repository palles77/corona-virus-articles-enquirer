            "text": "A cDNA comprising the complete genome of West Nile Virus (WNV) was generated by chemical synthesis using published sequence data, independent of any preformed viral components. The synthetic WNV, produced by transfection of in vitro transcribed RNA into cell culture, exhibited undistinguishable biological properties compared to the corresponding animal-derived wild-type virus. No differences were found concerning viral growth in mammalian and insect cell lines and concerning expression of viral proteins in cells. There were also no significant differences in virulence in mice following intranasal challenge. After immunizations of mice with experimental vaccines derived from the synthetic and wildtype viruses, protection from lethal challenge was achieved with similar amounts of antigen. Both vaccine preparations also induced comparable levels of neutralizing antibodies in mice. In addition, the synthetic approach turned out to be very accurate, since the rescued WNV genome contained no undesired mutations. Thus, the first flavivirus based on chemical gene synthesis was indistinguishable from the parent virus. This demonstrates that virus isolates from animal sources are dispensable to derive seed viruses for vaccine production or research.",

            "text": "West Nile Virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne, neurotropic member of the genus flavivirus, family Flaviviridae, and has been identified in Africa, Europe, the middle East, south and central Asia, Oceania (subtype Kunjin), and most recently North America (reviewed in [1] ). In the U.S. WNV activity in human, bird, companion animals or mosquito has been reported since 1999 to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) from almost all states. Besides WNV, the genus flavivirus comprises a number of medically important pathogens including Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), yellow fever virus (YFV), tick borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) [2] . The flavivirus genome is a positive-polarity, single-stranded RNA molecule of about 11,000 nucleotides (nt), which functions as mRNA for translation of the viral proteins. Genomic RNA is infectious when introduced into susceptible cells by transfection [3] . For replication and pathogenesis studies, reverse genetic systems have been established for several members of the genus [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . These systems comprise one or two plasmids encoding cDNA of viral genomic sequence under control of bacteriophage promoters allowing transcription of full-length infectious RNA in vitro. For YFV [4] , DEN-1 [17] , DEN-2 [6, 8, 10] , DEN-4 [11] , TBEV [13, 15] , KUN [9] , MVE [7] and WNV lineage I [19] and II [21] , cDNA comprising the full genome was stably cloned into bacterial expression plasmids, whereas in other reports [5, 8, 13, 18, 20] cDNA was split in two fragments, each integrated in individual plasmids, from which cDNA can be fused together before RNA transcription. An alternative approach was applied to construct a JEV infectious clone, in which the viral coding sequence was put under the control of a eukaryotic promoter and split by introns to circumvent instability during propagation in bacteria [22] .",

The viral cDNA encoding the 7.5 kb genome was assembled from overlapping oligonucleotides and yielded infectious virus after transcription of genomic RNA and inoculation into cell lysates [23] . Taking advantage of the rapid progression of gene synthesis technology (for review [24] ), we intended to adopt such a synthetic approach to produce a flavivirus cDNA system for the generation of a synthetic WNV seed virus for use in vaccine development. In this study we report the generation of a fully functional WNV virus from a completely synthetic source. The whole 11,029-nucleotide WNV genomic sequence was generated by gene synthesis without using natural viral templates. The production and characterization of the resulting West Nile Virus, which fully matched the sequence of the in silico designed viral genome, confirms the feasibility and accuracy of the synthetic flavivirus reverse genetic system.",

Three silent marker mutations were introduced (see also [19] ) allowing the discrimination of the synthetic virus from the corresponding wild-type isolate (see Table 1 ). The six synthetically generated WNV subfragments were ligated stepwise, resulting in two plasmids with corresponding parts of the complete genomic WNV sequence. For this purpose, either unique restriction sites in the WNV sequence were used, or -where appropriate -asymmetric restriction sites were generated in the plasmid vector backbone adjacent to the WNV fragments. Cleavage of these asymmetric sites created overhangs in the WNV sequence by which corresponding fragments could be fused together. Following this strategy, two plasmids were generated, containing either the 5 third (nt 1-3632 under control of a T7 promoter) or the 3 two-thirds (nt 3622-11,029) of the WNV genomic sequence, designated as pWNVsyn-5 TL or pWNVsyn-3 TL, respectively.

[27, 28] ). Usually the starting material for the generation of seed viruses for vaccines or such reverse genetics systems are virus stocks derived from a biological source. This virus is plaque-purified, viral RNA is isolated, transcribed into cDNA which is amplified by PCR and in turn gets assembled into a DNA copy of the viral genome. These approaches bear the risk of introducing mutations selected via plaque purification steps. To minimize this type of mutations we chose to generate a reverse genetics system using a different approach, independent of preformed viral RNA components and animal sources. The feasibility of generating such systems by chemical synthesis of DNA was proven previously, for instance, by the generation of poliovirus [29] , bacteriophage X174 [30] or H1N1 Spanish influenza virus [31] , and SARS-like coronavirus [32] . On the basis of these studies, we report for the first time the generation of an 11,000 nucleotide long synthetic genome of a member of the family Flaviviridae.

Sequencing of a virus genome (usually cloned by plaque purifications prior to sequence analysis) consisting of millions of molecules, results in a 'consensus' sequence, representing the majority genotype having defined biological properties. Biological properties may change, for instance, when pressure imposed by the host selects for changes of the genomic sequence, visible as a new 'consensus sequence' in the sequence analysis. In all of the cloning and propagation steps no mutations changing the wild-type consensus sequence were introduced by PCR using synthetic templates of verified nucleotide sequence proving the accuracy of this approach. Thus the synthetic progeny virus was biologically indistinguishable from its natural parent. Experimental inactivated vaccines derived from WNVwt and WNVsyn were highly immunogenic in animals. Both vaccine preparations induced comparable levels of neutralizing antibodies and led to similar protection results. Only in the low dosing groups of the protection study differences were observed that can be explained by the experimental conditions and the inherent inaccuracies of the biological system rather than by genetic differences in the two viruses. In addition, both virus stocks were indistinguishable concerning their virulence in mice.",

The possibility to synthesize pathogens without need for natural sources, for instance the viruses on the Select Agents List [35] , results in the expansion of the potential availability of select agents (defined as biological agents and toxins regulated by the US Select Agent Rules that have the potential to pose a severe threat to public, animal or plant health). The US government has developed guidance that addresses this issue [36] . WNV -although a biosafety level 3 virus -is endemic in large parts of the world and does not belong to the Select Agents. However, flaviviruses belonging to the tick-borne encephalitis virus complex are on this list. Construction of infectious flaviviruses, involving DNA synthesis, cloning, assembly into larger units, in vitro transcription and transfection steps, is a complex task and can be done in a professional environment only. A recent review on synthetic viruses discusses the dual use concerns in more detail [24] .",

Furthermore, this approach renders passaging, plaque purifications and other steps to achieve satisfactory purity of seed viruses from animal sources unnecessary. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of generating the flavivirus WNV in a completely synthetic approach. Synthetic biology is therefore a valuable alternative to obtain viral seed stocks free from the adventitious agents that might accompany recovery from vertebrate or insect cells.",

            "text": "Construction of the two partial cDNA clones. A schematic drawing of the WNV genome is indicated on the top. Dark gray boxes represent the viral structural and light gray boxes the nonstructural part of the coding sequence. The 5 and 3 noncoding regions (NCR) are indicated as thin lines. (a) Six WNV sequence segments were generated by gene synthesis (vector backbones are not shown). The 5 TL AB segment is corresponding to WNV genomic sequence nt 1-1792, 5 TL CD to nt 1789-3632, segment 3 TL AB to nt 3622-5801, 3 TL CD to nt 5792-8028, 3 TL EF to nt 8022-10,025 and 3 TL GH to nt 10,022-11,029. (b) Fragments 5 TL AB and 5 TL CD were ligated yielding the final 5 partial clone insert (5 TL) and two 3 part fragments were generated by fusing fragments 3 TL AB with 3 TL CD and 3 TL EF with 3 TL GH. (c) Final partial clones, integrated in pBR322, are indicated. The 3 partial clone was generated by ligation of the 3 TL ABCD with the 3 TL EFGH insert, taking advantage of the unique SpeI restriction site.",
