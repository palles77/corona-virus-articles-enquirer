            "text": "This study describes an antibody-dependent NK cell degranulation assay, as a biomarker to assess antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) response in influenza plasma and for antibody therapies against influenza infection. The concentration of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against the hemagglutinin receptor of influenza viruses is a current determinant in protection against infection, particularly following receipt of the seasonal influenza vaccine. However, this is a limited assessment of protection, because: (i) NAb titers that incur full protection vary; and (ii) NAb titers do not account for the entire breadth of antibody responses against viral infection. Previous reports have indicated that antibodies that prime ADCC play a vital role in controlling influenza infections, and thus should be quantified for assessing protection against influenza. This report demonstrates a non-radioactive assay that assesses NK cell activation as a marker of ADCC, in which NK cells interact with opsonized viral antigen expressed on the surface of infected Raji target cells resulting in effector cell degranulation (surrogate CD107a expression). A positive correlation was determined between HAI titers and sustained NK cell activation, although NK cell activation was seen in plasma samples with HAI titers below 40 and varied amongst samples with high HAI titers. Furthermore, sustained NK cell degranulation was determined for influenza-vaccinated transchromosomic bovine intravenous immunoglobulin, indicating the potential utility of this therapy for influenza treatment. We conclude that this assay is reproducible and relevant.",

Influenza viruses are estimated to cause 3-5 million severe clinical infections yearly resulting in 250,000-500,000 fatalities (Stohr, 2002) . Influenza A viruses, including H3N2 and H1N1 subtypes, are involved in seasonal epidemics with pandemic potential (Stohr, 2002) . Immune-mediated protection against influenza viruses is thought to be largely dependent on neutralizing antibody (NAbs) specific against the membrane-distal portion of the viral envelope protein hemagglutinin (HA) preventing binding of virus to target cell sialic acids (Matlin et al., 1981) .",

Demonstration of serotype-and subserotype-(\"subtype-\") specific Ab responses in individuals following suspected infection or vaccination may be accomplished by a variety of methods. For influenza, the most widely used assay to assess antibody (IgG and otherwise) levels is the hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay, which provides a relative measure of the quantity of anti-HA Abs present in patient sera/plasma (Hobson et al., 1972; Katz et al., 2011) . Additional assays that are employed include the neuraminidase inhibition (NI) and microneutralization (MN) assays that are used to detect neuraminidase-specific antibodies and the ability of plasma antibodies to neutralize infectivity of influenza virus respectively. The serological methods described above do not assess the entire breadth of the antibody mediated responses to influenza viruses. Additional serological and cellular effector functions include: (i) complement activation (Terajima et al., 2011) ; (ii) phagocytosis (El Bakkouri et al., 2011; Huber et al., 2001; Ana-Sosa-Batiz et al., 2016) ; and (iii) antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) (Greenberg et al., 1979; Jegaskanda et al., 2013a Jegaskanda et al., , 2016 Jegaskanda et al., , 2014a Jegaskanda et al., ,b, 2013b Vanderven et al., 2016; Zhong et al., 2016; Co et al., 2014; Florek et al., 2014; Jegaskanda et al., 2013d; Srivastava et al., 2013; Jegaskanda et al., 2017 Jegaskanda et al., , 2013c .",

However, if viral particles escape from NAbs and establish infection inside target cells NAbs may no longer be optimally effective, and immune effector cells are then required to recognize and eliminate virally infected cells. NK cells are an immune effector cell type that provides a first line of defense against infections and cell malignancies. NK cells can bind to cell surface antigen-Ab immune complexes via the Fc portion of the antibody. Fc\u03b3RIII is a receptor found on a number of different effector cells, importantly NK cells, and is involved in effector cell recognition of virally infected cells and induction of ADCC (Wren et al., 2013) . CD107a (LAMP1) expression on NK cells has been used as a surrogate marker for the identification of natural killer cell activity (Alter et al., 2004) .",

Assays based on radioactive chromium-labeling of target cells have been used to demonstrate the presence of antibodies capable of ADCC activity (Greenberg et al., 1979) , and to demonstrate the presence of ADCC antibodies in clinical influenza serum samples (Co et al., 2014) . Assays based on assessing CD107a expression of NK cells following incubation on serum-treated plates coated with influenza proteins have been conducted (Jegaskanda et al., 2013a (Jegaskanda et al., , 2014a (Jegaskanda et al., ,b, 2013b Vanderven et al., 2016; Zhong et al., 2016; Florek et al., 2014; Jegaskanda et al., 2013d; Jegaskanda et al., 2017 Jegaskanda et al., , 2013c . These studies have largely used a flow-based ADCC NK cell activation assay using methods that are less physiologically relevant due to the removal of target cell and effector cell interaction. One influenza ADCC study utilized a flow-based method for assessing target cell lysis via membrane-labeling dyes following effector cell interaction (Srivastava et al., 2013) . Influenza-infection of A549, an immortalized human epithelial cell line, has also been utilized for measuring ADCC Ab activity using CD107a expression of NK cells co-incubated with target cells (Jegaskanda et al., 2017 (Jegaskanda et al., , 2013c DiLillo et al., 2014) . Additionally, a bioassay to measure Fc\u03b3RIIIa activation by ADCC-Abs has also been conducted using influenza HA-transfected A549 cells following incubation with human plasma samples and Jurkat (effector) cells (Cox et al., 2016) . Additional non-radioactive ADCC assays are becoming commercially available (Surowy et al., 2012) .",

            "text": "ADCC-mediated clearance of virally infectected cells and ADCC protection following vaccination or natural infection are potentially important immune mechanisms against influenza infection. Immunoglobulin-based therapuetic products such as human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) should also be capable of stimulating an ADCC immune response to be maximally effective therapeutics. Previous studies have demonstrated the capacity of immunized bovine IgG to induce NK cell activation and mediate ADCC immunity to HIV infection (Kramski et al., 2012) . Recently SAB Biotherapeutics has developed a transchromosomic (Tc) bovine system that replaces knocked out bovine immunoglobulin genes with a human artificial choromosome containing full germline sequences of human immunoglobulin (Kuroiwa et al., 2009; Matsushita et al., 2014 Matsushita et al., , 2015 Sano et al., 2013) . These Tc bovine are capable of producing full human antibodies, and have been used to produce polyclonal human IgG against hantavirus (Hooper et al., 2014) , Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) , and Ebola Zaire virus (Dye et al., 2016) . Tc bovine hyperimmunized against pandemic strains of influenza also have the potential to produce a commercially viable IVIG product capable of neutralizing antibody and ADCC-antibody functions. As such, development of a standardized NK cell assay for detecting ADCC activity against influenza viruses could aid in the assessment of: (i) population immunity; (ii) vaccine and therapuetic IVIG treatment efficacy; and (iii) possibly a clinical assay to indicate if an infected individual will or will not progress to severe illness.",

In this study we describe a reproducible and relevant method for assessing NK cell degranulation titer of plasma/ sera samples. Using this assay we determined that Tc bovine IVIG had a high titer of NK cell degranulation antibodies, and thus represents a system that could be used as a countermeasure to rapidly produce fully human antibodies capable of eliciting ADCC responses against pandemic influenza.",

Effector cells for assessing NK cell degranulation were the non-adherent fraction of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors. Donor PBMCs were screened for NK cell degranulation capacity in our lab as previously published (Sun et al., 2017) . Utilizing data from that study, donor PBMCs with a degranulation capacity above 10% of background were utilized for all subsequent experiments described within this manuscript. The preparation of non-adherent PBMCs has been described previously (Sun et al., 2006) . Briefly, cryopreserved whole PBMCs were thawed, washed and brought to 2 \u00d7 10 6 cells/mL in culture medium, and were placed into a 6 well plate (Becton Dickinson MultiwellTM PrimariaTM 6 well; Becton Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) at 3 mL/well. The plate was kept at 37\u00b0C for 1-2 h to allow monocytes to adhere to the plate. After adherence, non-adherent cells were gently collected from the plate into a 15-mL or a 50-mL tube. The non-adherent cells were then washed once and were brought to 1 \u00d7 10 6 cells/mL in culture medium. The cells were left in the 15-mL or 50-mL tube in a humidified 37\u00b0C 5% CO 2 incubator overnight.

The NK cell degranulation assay NK cell degranulation was assessed by the expression of CD107a on effector cells using a modified method described previously (Sun et al., 2017; Chung et al., 2009) . Briefly, on a 96 well U-bottom tissue culturetreated plate (Corning Costar), Raji cells were aliquoted at 100,000 cells/well and washed two times with PBS to remove residual FBS. Virus stock was diluted to a final concentration of 102 HAU per well with RPMI media with 1% BSA, P/S, and 2 \u03bcg/mL TPCK, and aliquoted at 100 \u03bcL/well. Plates were incubated 24 h at 37\u00b0C with humidity and 5% CO 2 . Plates were then washed two times with PBS, and dilutions of 1:200, 1:1000, 1:5000, and 1:25000 of plasma (100 \u03bcL/well) were applied and incubated on ice for 1.5 h. Plates were washed two times with PBS. Target cells treated with plasma were then divided into two parts, one for assessment of opsonization immediately after plasma treatment, and the other for determination of NK cell degranulation. For the opsonization plate, 100 \u03bcL/well of PE-conjugated \u03b1-human IgG (FC gamma-specific, 12-4998-82, EBioscience, San Diego, CA) diluted to 1:200 was added and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. Plates were washed and then antibody opsonization of infected cells was assessed via flow cytometry on the FACS Canto II (Becton Dickinson). For setting up the NK cell degranulation assay, effector cells were collected, counted, and reconstituted in complete RPMI media to a concentration of 1 \u00d7 10 6 cells/mL. 100 \u03bcL/ well of effector cells were added to plasma-treated infected or uninfected target cells (Raji) at a ratio of 1:1 and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. Media was removed and 20 \u03bcL of antibody cocktail containing 1:20 of \u03b1-CD56 (APC), \u03b1-CD3 (PerCp), \u03b1-CD16 (PE), and 1:10 of \u03b1-CD107a (FITC) (BD Biosciences) were added to each well and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 130 \u03bcL PBS. Cells were then assessed by flow cytometry. The CD3 \u2212 CD56 + NK cells were gated and the percentage of CD107a + cells within the NK cell population was analyzed. Effector cells not cultured with target cells were set as a negative control for background CD107a expression. Effector cells cultured with plasma-untreated target cells were set as baseline controls for Ab-independent NK cell activation.",

We assessed cells for viral antigen expression with an \u03b1-HA MAb. Results indicated a rate of infection ( Fig. 1 ) congruent with previous determinations (Srivastava et al., 2013) . Cell populations were either stained right after incubation or fixed and permeabilized to compare overall HA expression vs. HA expression on cell surface (Fig. 1A) . Both indicated HA expression at 24 h following virus incubation with cells; however, this tapered off in the non-permeabilized population with increasing dilution of virus (Fig. 1B) . In contrast, the permeabilized population demonstrated a consistent rate of HA expression (\u223c59-66%) in all dilutions. We believe that the tapering off of HA expression seen for the non-permeabilized cells is likely due to increased non-internalized virions present on the cell surface for the lower dilutions of virus compared to higher dilutions. This results in a higher cell surface staining for HA for lower dilutions of virus compared to higher dilutions without affecting overall intracellular levels of HA. In addition, the mean fluorescence intensity of HA expression was significantly higher in the permeabilized cells than the non-permeabilized cells at all dilutions of virus (Fig. 1C) .",

The titer of Abs capable of stimulating NK cell activation was assessed by determining the fold increase of the NK cell response (Fig. 3C ) and the absolute value of the NK cell response (Fig. 3D ). Fold increase of NK cell response was determined by the fold increase of the CD107a NK cell response for infected cells compared to uninfected cells at each dilution. The absolute value of the CD107a NK cell response was determined as the percentage of NK cells expressing CD107a for infected cells minus the percentage for uninfected cells. The highest dilution of plasma that had both a two-fold increase of CD107a expression and an absolute value of CD107a over one was determined as the titer of NK cell degranulation. We selected 26 samples of human plasma. HAI titers against A/ California/07/2009 ranged from 5 to 1280, organized in low (HAI 5-50), middle (HAI 160-202), and high (HAI 320-1280) groups (Table 1) . Opsonization (presented as binding intensity) to uninfected cells was consistently low. For infected cells, we observed a MFI of 5000 or higher for opsonization of antigen in the 1:200 dilutions in all plasma except for Low10, High1, and High8 (Fig. 4A ). In 1:1000 or higher dilutions, opsonization tapered off dramatically in cells treated with the low titer and middle titer plasma. This phenomenon occurred to a lesser extent with the middle titer group. We observed higher opsonization in the 1:200 dilutions for most of the samples in the high titer group, and continued to see significant opsonization in the higher dilutions with the exception of High1 and High8 plasmas, which consistently showed diminished opsonization akin to the samples with low titer (Fig. 4A) .",

            "text": "Titers of hemagglutination antibodies against the globular head of the HA receptor of influenza viruses is a current correlate of protection from influenza virus infection. Generally, a titer of 1:40 is considered protective (Co et al., 2014; Baz et al., 2013) . However, this varies widely amongst individuals. Children, in particular, usually have experienced less exposure, and tend to require higher titers of around 1:110 to incur a 50% protective rate (Black et al., 2011) . Protective titers can vary even among individuals in similar age ranges (Co et al., 2014) . The HAI assay, which screens for hemagglutination inhibition, is the current means to predict protection. However, this metric has its limitations. In addition to the aforementioned unpredictable and varying range of titers required to incur immunity among individuals, HAI assays determine levels of hemagglutination against the HA globular head alone. The activities of neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies against the HA stalk, or other viral proteins such as the ion channel matrix protein, nucleoprotein or neuraminidase are not detected by this assay. Routine evaluation of vaccine-induced antibody responses and determination of protective titers will potentially benefit from utilizing additional influenza assays such as NI, MN, and ADCC assays. The MN assay, for instance, has demonstrated utility for evaluating influenza serostatus of individuals and evaluating protective titers against seasonal influenza (Verschoor et al., 2015) . Importantly, other immune responses, such as ADCC, have been established as vital in providing protection against influenza viruses (Greenberg et al., 1979; Jegaskanda et al., 2013a Jegaskanda et al., , 2016 Jegaskanda et al., , 2014a Jegaskanda et al., ,b, 2013b Co et al., 2014; Jegaskanda et al., 2013d; Srivastava et al., 2013; DiLillo et al., 2014; Simhadri et al., 2015) .",

Journal of Virological Methods 248 (2017) 7-18 sensitivity as 51 Cr assays often demonstrate low sensitivity and spontaneous release of the isotope from non-lysed target cells (Zaritskaya et al., 2010) . ELISA-based approaches lend themselves well to highthroughput assays. While the method of coating ELISA plates with purified antigen also removes the radioactivity hazard, it also has limitations. The plate-coating method is an excellent means to select for specific antibodies against a given antigen in serum or plasma; however, it removes effector cell interaction with opsonized antigen on an infected cell. Our method returns this cell to cell interaction using Raji cells as the target. In addition, other components in plasma, as well as on the cell surface, may affect binding affinity between the Fc region and the receptors on effector cells \u2212 variables that are removed altogether when antibodies are purified and/or presented with purified antigen alone Srivastava et al., 2013; Wren et al., 2013) . NK cell activation is controlled by a balance of inhibitory and activating signals (Moretta et al., 2001) , and a further advantage of the method described herein is that it could allow for future studies that more deeply assess this NK cell activation/inhibition balance in the setting of influenza-infected target cells and ADCC. Our use of a target cell provides a sound model for assessing the process of ADCC priming in the context of infection with influenza. Furthermore, this method is consistent with reproducibility demonstrated for both opsonization and CD107a degranulation of effector cells (Fig. 3) . Future studies will be needed to determine how well the Raji target cell assay described herein correlates with ELISA-based, including Fc\u03b3R dimer-binding, assays.",

However, it should be noted that this correlation was conducted with a relatively small set of samples, and that the relationship between HAI titer and NK cell degranulation titer is more complicated than the demonstrated correlation herein presented. In our set, plasma with higher HAI titer tended to demonstrate higher ability to sustain NK cell activity/NK degranulation titer. However, NK cell activation was observed in plasma with HAI titers lower than the suggested protective titer of HAI 40. In addition, NK cell activation varied in persons with high HAI titers with endpoint titers ranging from < 1:200 to 1:25,000. This is consistent with what has been previously reported in regards to a weak correlation between HAI and ADCC antibody titers (Zhong et al., 2016; Co et al., 2014) , in addition to what we have observed over multiple experiments. Of particular note, Plasma1 (HAI 1280) and Plasma2 (HAI 640) had vastly different abilities to stimulate NK cell degranulation. Despite having a higher HAI titer than Plasma2, Plasma1 was a poorer inducer of ADCC. This suggests that HAI titers do not strongly correlate with ADCC titers. Recent evidence suggests that HAI-inducing antibodies do not optimally induce ADCC activity Leon et al., 2016) . There have also been reports indicating the presence of cross-reactive ADCC-mediating Ab titers in influenza-seropositive individuals without detectable NAb titers (Jegaskanda et al., 2013a; Jegaskanda et al., 2013c; Terajima et al., 2015) . In aggregate these reports suggests that HAI, a surrogate for NAb titer, does not in all cases correlate with ADCC-mediating Ab titer, and HAI-inducing antibodies may in fact block the induction of ADCC by other antibodies . The correlation we determined between HAI titer and NK cell degranulation titer may be attributed to the overall higher titers of influenza-specific antibodies present in the high HAI samples compared to the low HAI samples. Finally, we have observed a mild correlation between Ag/Ab binding intensity to the surface of infected cells and the NK cell degranulation activity. This suggests that for serum/plasma with or without a protective HAI titer, the opsonization to infected cells is essential for the sample's ADCC activity.",

As such development of alternative therapies, in addition to vaccination, is warranted for preparation for future pandemic strains of influenza. Influenza passive immunotherapy treatments include use of convalescent plasma, hyperimmune immunoglobulins, or monoclonal antibody therapies. Convalescent patient blood products have demonstrated utility in reducing mortality associated with the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic (Luke et al., 2006) and for treatment of H5N1 influenza (Zhou et al., 2007) . In response to the rapid need to generate human antibodies for passive immunotherapy against pandemic strains of influenza monoclonal antibodies, convalescent plasma, and hyperimmune human-derived immunoglobulins are not ideal due to economic, logistic, and time factors. One potential source for rapidly producing fully human polyclonal antibodies for passive immunotherapy is the Tc bovine system. Vaccinated Tc bovines can produce convalescent plasma pools from which human IgG can be purified (150-600 g of Tc human IgG per animal per month). Using our assay and assessing an influenza-vaccinated Tc bovine IVIG therapeutic, NK cell degranulation was specific for virally-infected cells and demonstrated a high titer of NK degranulation antibodies (1:5000). Any additional benefits of influenzavaccinated Tc bovine IVIG therapy compared to human IVIG therapeutics and bovine colostrum IgG therapeutics will need to be further assessed. However, influenza-vaccinated Tc bovine IVIG therapy deserves additional evaluation as a potential therapeutic for critically ill H1N1-infected patients. This therapy has the ability to initiate ADCC antibody responses, which is an important mechanism of protection in already infected patients.",

ADCC-mediated responses to influenza can recognize a broader range of influenza strains than neutralizing antibodies, that generally target a more highly variable region of influenza proteins (Jegaskanda et al., 2014a) . ADCC-mediating antibodies have been demonstrated to the 2009 novel swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus (A(H1N1)pdm09) prior to the 2009 pandemic in individuals greater than 45 years of age who did not have detectable HAI titers (Jegaskanda et al., 2013a) . Furthermore, in studies where NAbs were not detected to A(H1N1)pdm09, non-NAbs titers correlated with protection from severe infection (O'Donnell et al., 2012; Weinfurter et al., 2011) . This demonstrates the utility of assays for assessing ADCC for global influenza surveillance and population immunity. Use of ADCC assays may also drive a shift away from solely assessing the role of neutralizing or HAI-mediating Abs for vaccine efficacy and antibody passive immunotherapuetic assessment. ADCC-mediating Abs can target internal proteins of influenza virus . Targets of ADCC include: (i) HA (Zhong et al., 2016) ; (ii) the intracellular nucleoprotein antigen (Jegaskanda et al., 2017) , that has been shown to be transiently expressed on virally infected cell surface (Yewdell et al., 1981) ; and (iii) neurominidase and matrix-2 proteins (Terajima et al., 2015) . Vaccine induction or therapeutic production of antibodies that target influenza internal proteins via ADCC response may prove to be a new development for influenza vaccine/treatment design.",

(A) Heat map analysis of the average fold increase of the CD107a NK cell response for infected cells compared to matched uninfected controls at each dilution of plasma. Green is for values < 2; yellow is for values \u2265 2; pink is for values \u2265 4; light red is for values \u22656; and dark red is for values \u2265 8. N/A = not available as the value was zero or negative. (B-C) Using 1:200 dilution of plasma an analysis of the NK cell degranulation assay was performed for all human plasma samples. Green triangles, high HAI titer; red squares, middle HAI titer; and blue diamonds, low HAI titer.(B) The absolute value of the CD107a NK cell response, expressed as the percentage of NK cells expressing CD107a for infected cells minus the percentage for uninfected cells, plotted on the y-axis and the fold increase of the CD107a NK cell response for infected cells compared to uninfected cells plotted on the x-axis. Statistical results from a non-parametric Pearson correlation analysis (two-tailed) demonstrated a positive correlation.
