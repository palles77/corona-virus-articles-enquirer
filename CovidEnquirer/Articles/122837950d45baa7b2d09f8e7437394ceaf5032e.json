            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first reported in the Chinese province of Guangdong in November, 2002, and caused an outbreak there in January to April, 2003. 1 A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been identified as the causative agent of this emerging disease. 2, 3 In Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the index case of the SARS outbreak can be dated back to February, 2003 . Since then the disease has become pandemic, with (at the time of writing) 8098 patients and 744 deaths in over 30 countries. 4, 5 The complete genomes of four SARS-CoV isolates have been sequenced independently. 6 Comparison with sequences of other human and animal coronaviruses has shown that SARS-CoV is distinct from them and warrants classification as a new group within the Coronaviridae. [7] [8] [9] SARS-CoV is an enveloped, positive-sense, singlestranded-RNA virus. The genome is about 27 000 bp, encoding the replicase and spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins. [7] [8] [9] In most animal and human coronaviruses, the gene for the spike protein is divided into amino (S1) and carboxyl (S2) regions; the S1 subunit is associated with receptor-binding functions, and the S2 subunit is a conserved transmembrane protein mediating fusion of viral and cellular membranes. 10 The spike protein is also important in viral entry, pathogenesis, 10 antiviral immune response, 11 virulence, 12 and cellular 13 or even species tropism. 14 In general, the spike protein is the most variable region of the genome and has generally been used for genotyping of coronaviruses, as shown by studies on human coronaviruses 15 and on avian infectious bronchitis virus. 16 Therefore, phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV is primarily based on the S1 region of the spike protein sequence.",

We also studied three virus isolates obtained from three patients in Guangdong Chest Hospital during February. All these samples were collected as part of routine clinical management. The epidemiological relations and clinical features of the key patients associated with the Hong Kong and Guangdong isolates Molecular epidemiology of the novel coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome have been described previously. 1, 4, 17 Those relevant to this study are summarised in table 1. These include the presumed index case patient 1 (HKU-33) and patients directly related to him (figure 1). Patient X, the index case of the large outbreak of over 300 cases in an apartment block, Amoy Gardens, was probably indirectly linked epidemiologically to patient 1. [18] [19] [20] To investigate whether apparent differences in transmission and clinical presentation of disease acquired in Amoy Gardens are related to viral genetic differences, the whole genomes of viral isolates from two of these patients (HKU-65 and HKU-66) were sequenced. The full genomes of four viruses from patients with no epidemiological link to patient 1 in Hong Kong (HKU-36) and Guangdong (GZ-43, GZ-50, GZ-60) were also studied.",

Only three viruses in cluster A were from patients from Hong Kong (HKU-33867, CUHK-W1, and HKU-36; figure 2; http://image.thelancet.com/extras/ 03art5344webfigure1.pdf). Since these three patients were recently returned from Guangdong (table 1) and the incubation period of the disease ranges from 1 day to 14 days, all three probably acquired their infections in February directly from Guangdong, rather than from Hong Kong. 1, 18, 24 The other viruses from Hong Kong grouped together in cluster B, together with the virus sequences derived from the presumed index case for the outbreak in Hong Kong (HKU-33a/b), as well as viruses from Canada (Tor2), Singapore (eg, SIN2500), Germany (Frankfurt 1), Italy (HSR1), Singapore, Taiwan, and Vietnam (Urbani).

The M-61576 sequence was derived by direct RT-PCR and sequencing from the urine sample of a patient from the Amoy Gardens outbreak in April, 2003, which is geographically and epidemiologically unrelated to the two Guangdong viruses. This 3 bp deletion leads to deletion of an aminoacid residue and a change of the residue next to it. Isolates HKU-65 and HKU-66, derived from the throat and stool samples, respectively, of two patients from the Amoy Gardens outbreak, were completely genetically sequenced ( figure 3) . With HKU-39849 as the reference strain, there were seven sequence variations. Four were recurrent variations that were found in more than one virus ( figure 3) , and the other three were non-recurrent (data not shown) and located at positions 20485 (ORF1ab) and 27384 (X2) in the genome of HKU-65 and at position 16325 (ORF1ab) in HKU-66.

Although molecular epidemiology cannot pinpoint the initiator of this outbreak with precision, the first virus from cluster B identified in Hong Kong was that isolated from patient 1 (HKU-33). Thus, taken together with the epidemiological data, the molecular epidemiology is compatible with the suggestion 4 that patient 1 was the index case of the outbreak in Hong Kong. The viruses in Canada, Singapore, Taiwan, and Vietnam also belong to cluster B, so the evidence supports the contention that these outbreaks derived from patient 1.",

Why these viruses did not spread in the Hong Kong population when HKU-33a/b did so is unclear. Epidemiological data suggest that a few index cases caused a disproportionate number of secondary cases, the so-called \"super-spreading incidents\". 24 The initiation by HKU-33a/b in patient 1 of the first superspreading incident in Hong Kong may have been simply a matter of chance. Once this had occurred, second superspreading events (as happened in Prince of Wales Hospital and in the Amoy Gardens apartment block) were stochastically more likely to follow from this cluster. An alternative hypothesis is that the viruses of the HKU-33a/b lineage (cluster B) are biologically more predisposed to initiating super-spreading events. This hypothesis needs more detailed investigation. Whether the presence of more than one genetic variant in patient 1 is relevant to the rapid spreading of this virus strain also requires further investigation.",

However, sequence comparison of the two Amoy Gardens isolates did not reveal any significant variations within the S1 gene (figure 2) nor across the rest of the genome (figure 3). This virus is therefore unlikely to have arisen from a different source from that of the major Hong Kong outbreak. The explosive transmission of the virus during the Amoy Gardens outbreak may be explained by an unusual route of transmission. 20 Aerosolisation of contaminated sewage 20 and a role for animal vectors such as rodents 27 have been proposed.",

For convenience of display of a large number of isolates, field isolates with zero genetic distance compared with their subcluster (B1, B2-1, and B2-2) common ancestors are replaced by the subcluster name with the number of isolates shown in parentheses (highlighted in blue). The full phylogenetic tree of the 169 isolates is available at http://image.thelancet.com/extras/03art5344webfigure1.pdf. Viral gene sequences highlighted in red represent key isolates described infigure 1. Sequences previously available in Genbank are shown in bold and italic. Subcluster names are shown on the right of the tree. Total numbers of isolates included in the cluster are shown in brackets. Cluster transition isolates are indicated by blue dotted arrows. Epidemiological details of key viruses are provided in table 1 and figure 1. Other viruses sequenced as part of this study are prefixed with F, M, or A, to represent the month of sample collection (February, March, or April). Sequence alignment of the recurrent critical point mutations that distinguish the groups and subgroups are shown on the right of the tree. All these mutations are non-silent except at 1026 and 1068 (highlighted in green).",
