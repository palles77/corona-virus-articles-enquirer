However, the trainee radiologists (Junior Specialist Registrars (SpRs) in years 2 and 3, Senior SpRs in years 4, 5 and 6) had success and complication rates approaching the target ranges suggested by the Royal College of Radiologists Standards Committee (unpublished). These ranges were derived from a literature review, and used by us as our audit standards (primary success rates 88 -99%, major complications 4-8%, and minor complications 3-15%).",

Riddell and Charig have documented that 24% of the consultant radiologists who perform PCNs out of hours are not performing such procedures as part of their routine clinical practice [1] . Our data indicate that relatively inexperienced operators can achieve acceptable success and complication rates. Many of the non-specialist radiologists who cover the out of hours service will have been trained to perform ultrasound-guided puncture procedures, and may indeed be performing them as part of their routine clinical practice. They should therefore be competent to perform PCNs (to an acceptable level) out of hours. ",
