            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoV) and picornaviruses are plus-strand RNA viruses that use 5\u2032 cap-dependent and cap-independent strategies, respectively, for viral mRNA translation initiation. Here, we analyzed the effects of the plant compound silvestrol, a specific inhibitor of the DEAD-box RNA helicase eIF4A, on viral translation using a dual luciferase assay and virus-infected primary cells. Silvestrol was recently shown to have potent antiviral activity in Ebola virus-infected human macrophages. We found that silvestrol is also a potent inhibitor of capdependent viral mRNA translation in CoV-infected human embryonic lung fibroblast (MRC-5) cells. EC 50 values of 1.3 nM and 3 nM silvestrol were determined for MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E, respectively. For the highly pathogenic MERS-CoV, the potent antiviral activities of silvestrol were also confirmed using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as a second type of human primary cells. Silvestrol strongly inhibits the expression of CoV structural and nonstructural proteins (N, nsp8) and the formation of viral replication/transcription complexes. Furthermore, potential antiviral effects against human rhinovirus (HRV) A1 and poliovirus type 1 (PV), representing different species in the genus Enterovirus (family Picornaviridae), were investigated. The two viruses employ an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-mediated translation initiation mechanism. For PV, which is known to require the activity of eIF4A, an EC 50 value of 20 nM silvestrol was determined in MRC-5 cells. The higher EC 50 value of 100 nM measured for HRV A1 indicates a less critical role of eIF4A activity in HRV A1 IRESmediated translation initiation. Taken together, the data reveal a broad-spectrum antiviral activity of silvestrol in infected primary cells by inhibiting eIF4A-dependent viral mRNA translation.",

            "text": "We have recently identified the natural compound silvestrol as a potent antiviral molecule to inhibit Ebola virus (EBOV) replication (Biedenkopf et al., 2017) . Silvestrol can be isolated from plants of the genus Aglaia. It belongs to the flavaglines, which have a cyclopenta [b] benzofuran skeleton in common (Pan et al., 2014) . Recently, a CRISPR/ Cas-based genetic proof of silvestrol's target specificity for the DEADbox RNA helicase eIF4A was provided (Chu et al., 2016) . This enzyme is required to unwind stable RNA secondary structures in 5\u2032 UTRs of capped mRNAs to create a binding platform for the 43S preinitiation complex which then scans the 5\u2032 UTR for the start codon to initiate protein synthesis (Hinnebusch et al., 2016) . Binding of silvestrol to eIF4A increases its affinity to the mRNA, thereby stalling the helicase to its substrate (Sadlish et al., 2013) . This might lead to depletion of eIF4A from the translation initiation complex eIF4F that recognizes the m7GpppN cap structure of mRNAs (Pelletier et al., 2015) . Silvestrol is cytotoxic at low nanomolar concentrations to a large number of cancer cell lines and was also shown to exert strong antitumorigenic effects in several tumor mouse models (Cencic et al., 2009; Kogure et al., 2013; Patton et al., 2015) . Importantly, in non-cancer cells and primary cells, silvestrol seems to be well tolerated up to low micromolar concentrations (Su et al., 2006; Zhu et al., 2007; Biedenkopf et al., 2017) . The reasons are so far not well understood, however several proto-oncogenes that are sensitive to silvestrol harbor extended 5\u2032UTRs with extensive RNA secondary structure elements. Therefore, it has been https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2017.12.010 Received 5 October 2017; Received in revised form 12 December 2017; Accepted 14 December 2017 proposed that targeting eIF4A by silvestrol might lead to mRNA discrimination during translation (Cencic et al., 2009; Rubio et al., 2014) . Long and structured 5\u2032 UTRs are also often found in capped viral mRNAs like those from EBOV (Weik et al., 2002; Schlereth et al., 2016) . In line with this, we have found that low nanomolar concentrations of silvestrol strongly reduce EBOV titers in primary human macrophages by efficiently decreasing viral protein expression without having cytotoxic side effects at concentrations of effective antiviral activity (Biedenkopf et al., 2017) . Also many plus-strand (+) RNA viruses, such as corona-and picornaviruses, carry long and highly structured 5\u2032 UTRs with important functions in viral replication and/or translation initiation (reviewed in Madhugiri et al., 2016) . We therefore asked the question whether these viruses are also sensitive to silvestrol treatment and if this sensitivity differs among viruses using alternative mechanisms of translation initiation.",

To understand the effects of silvestrol on cap-dependent viral protein synthesis in more detail, we fused the 5\u2032 UTRs of all seven EBOV mRNAs to the firefly luciferase coding sequence in a dual luciferase reporter plasmid (Fig. 1A) . Expression of the fusion genes was driven by the HSV-TK promoter, and the corresponding mRNA transcripts underwent co-transcriptional 5\u2032-terminal capping by the respective host factors. The bicistronic reporter transcripts harbor a hepatitis C virus (HCV) IRES element downstream of the firefly luciferase ORF. This type III IRES directs Renilla luciferase gene translation by a 5\u2032-cap-and eIF4Aindependent mechanism (Bordeleau et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2017) and was used to normalize transfection efficiencies (Fig. 1A) . The 5\u2032 UTR of the mRNA encoding the oncogenic kinase PIM1, known to be highly sensitive to inhibition of eIF4A by silvestrol (Schatz et al., 2011) , served as a positive control, while the unstructured and short 5\u2032 UTRs of the \u00dfglobin and \u00df-actin mRNAs were used as negative controls. Concentrations of 5 or 10 nM silvestrol inhibited firefly luciferase expression of the \u00df-globin construct not at all, and that of the \u00df-actin construct by not more than 10%, whereas the same silvestrol concentrations resulted in \u223c40% inhibition for the PIM1 construct (Fig. 1B) . As a further control we analyzed the 5\u2032 UTR of the classical swine fever virus (CSFV) which contains an eIF4A-independent type III IRES element. As expected, no sensitivity towards silvestrol could be observed in the dual luciferase assay (Suppl. Fig. S1 ). For all seven EBOV 5\u2032 UTR constructs, the inhibitory effects of 10 nM silvestrol clearly exceeded the effects of the negative controls, with firefly luciferase activities decreasing by 23% (VP40 matrix protein) and up to 33% (L, RNA-directed RNA polymerase L). This is consistent with our previous results obtained for EBOV-infected macrophages (Biedenkopf et al., 2017) , where we observed efficient inhibition of viral mRNA translation at 10 nM silvestrol, although the effects of the same silvestrol concentration on reporter gene expression were generally less pronounced than on EBOV replication. In summary, we conclude that the dual luciferase assay is a suitable and reliable system to analyze the eIF4A dependence of 5\u2032capped viral mRNAs as an initial screen before infecting cells with pathogenic viruses.",

Following inoculation of the infected cells with the appropriate virus, silvestrol was added in increasing concentrations ranging from 0.01 nM to 10 \u03bcM and viral titers in cell culture supernatants collected at 24 h p.i. were determined. For HCoV-229E-infected Huh-7 cells, we measured an EC 50 value of 40 nM. The EC 50 values for HRV A1-infected HeLa cells and PV-infected Vero cells were 400 nM and 100 nM, respectively ( Fig. 2 and Table 1 ). To assess the cytotoxicity of silvestrol in these cell lines, CC 50 values were determined in MTT assays. CC 50 values of 30 nM for Huh-7 cells, 160 nM for Vero cells and 5 nM for HeLa cells were obtained (Suppl.

Our findings are in line with the strong inhibitory effects of silvestrol reported previously for a range of cancer cell lines (Schatz et al., 2011) . The data result in very low selectivity indices for this compound if permanent rather than primary cells were used for infections with the respective viruses (SI \u2264 1.6, Table 1 ). Taken together, the data obtained here and in our previous study (Biedenkopf et al., 2017) led us to conclude that permanent cell lines are not suitable for studying antiviral activities of silvestrol and prompted us to use primary cells in subsequent experiments.",

            "text": "In our previous study, specific and potent antiviral activity of silvestrol was observed in EBOV-infected primary human macrophages (Biedenkopf et al., 2017) . We therefore decided to assess potential antiviral activities in human primary cells susceptible to the human corona-and picornaviruses used in this study. Human embryonic lung fibroblasts (MRC-5 cells) were infected with HCoV-229E, MERS-CoV, HRV A1 or PV at an MOI of 0.1 and silvestrol was added to the cell culture medium at concentrations ranging from 0.1 nM to 1 \u03bcM. Again, viral titers were determined 24 h p.i.. For HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV, EC 50 values of 3 nM and 1.3 nM, respectively, were obtained (Fig. 3A , B, Suppl. Fig. S3A, B and Table 1 ). The cytotoxicity of silvestrol was measured using MRC-5 cells that were grown in the presence of varying concentrations of silvestrol for 24 h at 33\u00b0C (corresponding to the temperature used for HCoV-229E and HRV A1 infections) or 37\u00b0C (corresponding to the temperature used for MERS-CoV and PV infections). CC 50 values of > 10 \u00b5M were measured at both temperatures (Fig. 4 , see also Table 1 ). The resulting selectivity indiceswere > 3330 for HCoV-229E and > 7690 for MERS-CoV, demonstrating low cytotoxicity and extremely efficient antiviral activity of silvestrol in primary cells (Table 1 ). The EC 50 values determined for HRV A1-and PV-infected MRC-5 cells were approximately 100 nM and 20 nM (Fig. 3C, D, Suppl. Fig. S3C , D and Table 1 ), respectively, suggesting that silvestrol also displays antiviral activities if the respective virus utilizes eIF4Adependent IRES-driven translation mechanisms. However, HRV A1 was \u223c30to 80-fold and PV \u223c7to 15-fold less sensitive to silvestrol treatment compared with the two coronaviruses included in this study (Fig. 3A-D) , indicating a less prominent role of eIF4A in translation initiation of the picornaviral mRNAs. In summary, the data obtained in this and our previous study (Biedenkopf et al., 2017) demonstrate that silvestrol is a potent antiviral inhibitor in primary cells infected with coronaviruses and EBOV. Importantly, the type I IRES-containing PV and, to a lesser extent, HRV A1 also proved to be sensitive to silvestrol treatment in primary cells. Altogether, these findings reveal a broadspectrum antiviral activity of silvestrol, including viruses with 5\u2032capped and structured 5\u2032 UTRs as well as those containing IRES elements that require eIF4A helicase activity for efficient translation initiation.",

This is in line with several studies that explored the effect of silvestrol in different cancer model systems. For example, no general toxicity of silvestrol could be detected in vivo in the liver, spleen or on blood cells; likewise, no general disease symptoms, loss of body weight or immune suppressive effects were observed (Lucas et al., 2009; Cencic et al., 2009; Patton et al., 2015) . Moreover, silvestrol showed favorable pharmacokinetics in terms of bioavailability and biostability (Saradhi et al., 2011) .

Specific inhibition of cellular factors, such as eIF4A, that promote the translation of structured viral transcripts should limit viral replication to low levels and thus help the immune system in establishing effective antiviral responses. Clearly, the observed antiviral effects of silvestrol need to be characterized in suitable in vivo infection models to validate its promising therapeutic potential. Fig. 6 .
