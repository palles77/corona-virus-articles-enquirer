This protein family includes several homologous proteins and a collection of other proteins lacking sequence similarity except for a Bcl-2 homology (BH)3 motif. Thus, membership in the Bcl-2 family requires only one of the four BH motifs. On this basis, a growing number of diverse BH3-only proteins are being reported. Although compelling cell biological and biophysical evidence validates many BH3-only proteins, claims of significant BH3 sequence similarity are often unfounded. Computational and phylogenetic analyses suggest that only some BH3 motifs arose by divergent evolution from a common ancestor (homology), whereas others arose by convergent evolution or random coincidence (homoplasy), challenging current assumptions about which proteins constitute the extended Bcl-2 family.",

However, past evolution of a protein family, such as the Bcl-2 family of apoptosis regulators, is protohistorically recorded in the genomes of present-day cells. The lack of ancestral sequences is only one of many obstacles to tracing the evolutionary history of genes and their cellular processes. The chronological order of discovery profoundly influences nomenclature and the interpretation of evidence. Also, there are notorious hurdles in obtaining reliable alignments of divergent (but homologous) or dissimilar (analogous but not homologous) sequences, such as BH3 motifs, for use in searching available databases. Despite limitations, comparisons across species have catapulted forward our understanding of biological processes, exemplified by Bcl-2 family proteins [1] . Thus, cross-species comparisons need to be captured and understood to broaden our biological knowledge of Bcl-2 family members and their central roles in normal development and in cancer.",

            "text": "In principle, the Bcl-2 family has been subdivided into several subfamilies based on their composition of BH motifs ( Figure 2 ). We took a closer look at the BH nomenclature. Despite the usefulness of this paradigmatic classification scheme, close inspection of BH motif sequences indicates that subfamily classifications draw heavily on prior knowledge of protein functions (for details, see below). Overextension of computational methods and subjective interpretations of sequence similarities have expanded the Bcl-2 family beyond justifiable limits. To gain a better understanding, we considered the possible origins of BH motifs by applying bioinformatics and phylogenetic concepts to more rigorously identify four distinct subfamilies of the extended Bcl-2 family. Three of these (Bcl2-like, Bax-like, and Bid-like) form a monophyletic group (share a common ancestor) (Figures 3 and 4) and a fourth comprises eight unrelated (or very distantly related) canonical BH3-only proteins ( Figure 2 ). Inclusion of these specific eight in the canonical BH3-only subgroup is also heavily dependent on prior knowledge. Bias in Bcl-2 subfamily nomenclature extends beyond amino acid sequence analysis. Assignment to anti-death or pro-death subgroups is challenging for those family members that lack obvious cell death-related phenotypes (e.g., Bok and Bcl2L13) and for those that can exhibit either anti-death or pro-death activity in different conditions or cell types. For example, Drosophila Buffy, mammalian Bcl-x L , and worm CED-9 are all traditionally categorized as antiapoptotic, but all three have also been shown to exhibit pro-death activity in vivo [7] [8] [9] . Here we illustrate the methodological and conceptual issues that have arisen in defining and classifying the various other BH3-containing proteins reported to date.",

Although several dimer interfaces have been identified between Bcl-2 family members, the best characterized is the interaction of BH3-only proteins with antideath Bcl-2 proteins. The BH3-containing helix of BH3only proteins inserts into a deep elongated binding cleft on anti-death Bcl-2 proteins, resulting in the inactivation of either or both binding partners [10] [11] [12] . By inhibiting BH3only proteins or by directly binding Bax (multi-BH proapoptotic Bcl-2 homolog), Bcl-x L can prevent homo-oligomerization of Bax that otherwise leads to mitochondrial outer membrane permeability (MOMP). Through MOMP, mitochondrial cytochrome c is released to act as a cytosolic cofactor for assembly of caspase-activating apoptosomes, and cell death occurs within a few minutes [13] . Because antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins promote tumor cell survival, BH3 mimetics have been developed as cancer therapeutics [14] .",

Furthermore, when we used InterProScan (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/pfa/iprscan/), a popular motifprediction tool that searches a given sequence against a compilation of protein signatures from different databases (e.g., PROSITE, PFAM), BH4 motifs were not identified in these latter proteins or in the other antiapoptotic (Bcl-B/ Bcl2L10 and Drosophila Buffy) or more distantly related First publication year for proteins with documented or predicted structural similarity with Bcl-2 (above line) and for proteins reported to contain only the Bcl-2 homology (BH)3 motif (below line).

This BH4 is annotated in both antiapoptotic (including Mcl-1, BFL-1/A1, and Buffy) and proapoptotic members (Bax, Bak, BOK, and Bcl2L13). However, the CDD identifier (132900) refers to a protein family (PFAM) signature that captures similarities across all the Bcl-2 family (PF00452), leading to the over-prediction of BH4-containing proteins and misannotation. A more recent effort was made to redefine BH4 as a motif present in most globular Bcl-2 family proteins, including both pro-and antiapoptotic members [18] . However, when we used this novel sequence signature . Although these difficulties do not exclude the presence of an evolutionarily conserved BH4 region among all Bcl-2 paralogs (e.g., defined by specific structural contacts), currently available bioinformatics has not clearly justified this classification as a sequence motif.",

Bcl2L13 is encoded in a tail-to-tail orientation with Bid in vertebrate genomes, suggesting that these two paralogs arose from a tandem inverted duplication, followed by functional divergence based on their antisymmetric distribution of BH motifs. Bcl2L13 has recognizable BH1 and BH2 motifs but a less conserved BH3, the antithesis of Bid ( Figure S1b in the supplementary information online). Bid has a structurally well-defined and functionally important BH3 motif and has also evolved unique functions in apoptosis [21, 22] and in the DNA damage checkpoint [23] [24] [25] . By contrast, Bcl2L13 may have lost its role in apoptosis regulation [26] .",

These eight (plus worm EGL-1) constitute the canonical BH3-only subfamily of the Bcl-2 family and are further subdivided into two groups based on their ability to directly (Bid, Bim, and Puma) or indirectly (Bad, Bik, Bmf, Hrk, Noxa, and in principle Caenorhabditis elegans EGL-1) activate the pro-death function of Bax to kill cells ( Figure S1d ,e in the supplementary information online).

Thus, in contrast to current nomenclature, Bid does not belong to the subgroup of canonical BH3-only proteins, but instead belongs to a branch of the Bcl-2 phylogenetic tree with Bcl2L12, -13, -14, and -15, which generally lack C-terminal transmembrane domains (Figures 3 and S1b in the supplementary information online). Bid is an example of misclassification by applying the BH motif criteria alone; additional evidence strongly argues for an evolutionary relationship (homology) between Bid and the Bcl-2 family. Yet the criterion for direct activatortype BH3-only proteins is defined by the biochemical properties of Bid (activated/caspase-cleaved tBid or its BH3 peptide). Thus, Bid may have additional functions in apoptosis regulation, beyond its BH3.",

Published BH3 motif searches have relied mainly on deterministic sequence patterns, such as the regular expression PS01259 of the PROSITE database (InterPro signature IPR020728). When we applied this pattern to search the database (UNI60/ UniProtKB with sequences 60% identity to avoid multiple copies of the same sequence), it recovered only two of the eight canonical BH3-only proteins, BIK and HRK (see Figure 2 in main text and Figure  S2 in the supplementary information online). Several groups have defined less stringent consensus sequences in attempt to capture more of the canonical BH3-only proteins [59] . Applying their 7-mer as a search criterion, we identified only one additional BH3-only protein (Bim) and 33,558 additional putative hits (see Figure 4 in main text and Figure S2 in the supplementary information online). Similar problems arise with the reported 9-residue [54] , 12-residue [55] , and 13-residue regular expressions [56] , one of which identified 25% of all proteins. The situation deteriorates if reported consensus patterns are modified additum (ad) to capture all of the BH3 sequences that were included in their respective published alignments (see Figures 2 and 4 in main text and supplementary information 3 online). By extending this search to plants, microorganisms and viruses, we identified putative BH3-only proteins in species that lack Bcl-2 homologs with which to interact (e.g., Chlamydomonas, Arabidopsis) and that lack true mitochondria (e.g., Giardia, Trichomonas). Furthermore, there was strikingly little overlap between hit lists, and the number of hits was not significantly different when the proteomes were shuffled or reversed (rearrangements of the same amino acids) (see Figure 4 in main text and supplementary information 3 online). Thus, the number of BH3 motifs identified by these strategies is not significantly different from random chance.",

Our experience with building HMM profiles with BH3-like proteins invariably leads to profile drift in iterated searches, indicating that these sequences collectively contribute noise.

However, a large body of compelling functional and structural evidence supports the existence of a BH3-like motif in Beclin 1. Through this BH3-mediated interaction of Beclin 1 with Bcl-2 proteins, autophagy appears to be functionally linked to the control of apoptosis. Although it seems obvious that the BH3 motifs of Bcl-2 and of Beclin 1 have distinct origins, it is also possible that some BH3-only proteins currently classified as Bcl-2 family members have BH3 sequence similarities due to either random coincidence or convergent evolution (selection of the same residues for identical functional reasons). To further clarify, there is no denial that the core BH3 motif sequence Leu-X(3)-Gly-Asp is present in many proteins and can be aligned by hand in a diagram, but this does not imply that they are homologous or are functionally equivalent. Conversely, the lack of verifiable sequence similarity using currently available bioinformatics does not negate the potential importance of BH3-like motifs in biology. There may be other cases where divergence accumulated over evolutionary timescales, producing proteins that will exhibit similarities only in this short region. Thus, the denomination of BH3-only protein carries some degree of ambiguity because many proteins that logically qualify for this designation belong to different protein families and contain other (non-BH) motifs.",

Furthermore, sequence similarity of BH3 is not sufficient to automatically infer common ancestral origins [31] (Box 1). This raises the question of how BH3 motifs arose in so many diverse proteins. The most logical assumption to explain the functionally and structurally validated BH3 motifs in unrelated proteins is that they arose independently on multiple occasions (homoplasy) owing to specific constraints (either biological or physicochemical), facilitating interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins. The surprising proteome-wide prevalence of potential BH3 motifs (Box 1) suggests that they could correspond to a particular class of short linear motifs [32] used as a binding interface to connect critical components of various biological pathways to the core apoptotic machinery. As in other short linear motifs, the short length of the BH3 signature and the small number of residues involved in functional interaction make BH3 motifs likely to appear and disappear in unrelated protein sequences by random mutation. This scenario does not exclude the possibility of divergent evolution in some instances, such as between the BH3-coding exons of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 homolog Bak and the BH3-only protein Bik, as we previously hypothesized [19, 20] . Moreover, because 3D structure evolves more slowly than sequence, remote homologs may be found among canonical/other BH3-containing proteins as more protein structures are solved.",

Similar difficulties challenge the evolutionary origins of RNA viruses, where high mutation rates obscure ancestral origins [36] . It is hoped that advances in structural genomics and remote homology detection coupled with the growing size of sequence databases will make it possible to capture more ancient evolutionary events and possibly reveal connections between Box 2. Criteria for including or rejecting candidate BH3 proteins Definitive bioinformatic procedures that reliably predict new BH3containing proteins are currently lacking (Box 1) and new, improved methods are needed. Although previously reported BH3 search strategies potentially narrow the list of candidates somewhat, there is little certainty of this. Similar issues plague our ability to accurately predict microRNA targets [62] . Even with improved bioinformatics, additional criteria are needed to avoid logical contradictions and false positives. Using Bid-like proteins as an example, it is reasonable to consider inclusion of proteins with Bcl-2-like 3D structures even in the absence of recognizable BH motifs [63] . Structural determinations and evidence for direct interactions of putative BH3 peptides with confirmed Bcl-2-homologous proteins using fluorescence polarization, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, or surface plasmon resonance have been applied to confirm new BH3 motifs, in addition to cell-based evidence to validate biochemical studies [64] . BH3 candidacy would also be supported by functional conservation in closely related species and by the pairing of a BH3 candidate with its target Bcl-2 family member in the same species or perhaps with an invading intracellular pathogen. In the absence of a host-parasite relationship, candidate BH3-only proteins encoded by non-metazoan species lacking Bcl-2 homologues or true mitochondria are difficult to justify (Box 3). There are potentially many clinically relevant peptides and small molecules that fit into the hydrophobic pockets of various Bcl-2 family proteins and mimic natural ligands. Although not derived from a natural protein, the case can be made to include peptides selected from an artificial library as bona fide BH3 motifs [65] , with the potential appellation of 'BH3-like', 'BH3-mimetic', or 'BH3 functional analog'.",

This could conceivably reflect conservation of function if mammalian Bcl-2 family proteins interface with highly conserved cellular machinery. Consistent with this model, Bcl-x L and Mcl-1 were recently reported to interact with the highly conserved mitochondrial ATP synthase [44, 45] . One potential implication would be that yeast and bacteria encode as yet unrecognized Bcl-2-shaped proteins explaining why they maintain the ability to interact with mammalian Bcl-2 proteins. Pursuit of these answers is seriously compromised until such putative Bcl-2-like proteins are identified in nonmetazoans, and there are equally valid alternative explanations that do not evoke conservation of function. Ectopically expressed mammalian Bcl-2 proteins may use different mechanisms to modulate cell survival/death in yeast by acting on distinct effector proteins. Alternatively, Bcl-2 proteins could act on lipid membranes, such as changing membrane curvature in a manner that does not require specific interactions with foreign proteins. Experimental investigation of yeast is likely to provide tremendous insight into many different cell-death mechanisms and may even reveal as yet unknown mechanisms of mammalian Bcl-2 proteins [46, 47] . However, the epistemic goal in this case would be different: to uncover the mechanisms of action of Bcl-2 family proteins, which is fundamentally different from establishing phylogenetic inferences (Box 3).",

The decoded genome sequences of the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica, the cnidarians Nematostella vectensis and Hydra vulgaris, the echinoderm Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, the urochordate Ciona intestinalis, and the cephalochordate Branchiostoma floridae revealed that these 'earlybranching' metazoan species have a large and unique set of Bcl-2 homologs [48] [49] [50] . These findings destabilize the idea of CED-9 being a prototypical multi-BH protein and that simpler metazoans are necessarily less equipped than Box 3. Do yeasts have BH3-only proteins?",

            "text": "One case in point is the candidate yeast BH3 protein Ybh3/Bxi1 (YNL305C) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is a member of the BI-1 protein family predicted with high confidence to be a multimembrane-spanning protein [66] [67] [68] . The reported assignment of a BH3 motif to yeast Ybh3 was made by visual inspection and the multiple alignment reveals only two fully conserved residues (Leu and Asp) followed by a less conserved amino acid (Asp or Glu). . This candidate yeast BH3 sequence is also somewhat truncated because it is located at the C terminus of the Ybh3 protein and overlaps one of six transmembrane segments, two unprecedented features among BH3-containing proteins. Furthermore, the putative BH3 sequence lacks conservation in orthologous proteins, potentially challenging its functional importance. Although this BH3 was reported to bind Bcl-x L and to promote yeast cell death, two other studies have reported that this yeast gene is pro-survival, not pro-death, consistent with BI-1 function in other species [67] [68] [69] . More perplexing is how this yeast protein might ever encounter human Bcl-x L . Still it is conceivable that non-metazoan species will be found to encode proteins that closely resemble the 3D structure of Bcl-2 family proteins to serve as a potential target of this yeast BH3 [70] . Nevertheless, currently available tools to define BH3 motifs in non-metazoans suggest that Ybh3 is just as likely to reflect a fortuitous event, although this does not negate its utility in research if it binds tightly and specifically to the cleft of Bcl-2. . Bcl-2 homology (BH)4 and BH3 motif searches identify improbable numbers of hits throughout major phylogenetic groups. InterPro signatures and patterns derived from published alignments ( Figure 2 ) were used to scan UniProt KnowledgeBase with reduced redundancy (no more than 60% identity, UNI60; release 2011_12) for sequences containing BH3 or BH4 motifs. Pie charts show the percent of proteins in each of the phylogenetic groups that were identified as hits by the indicated signature search. The total number of hits detected is shown within the pie chart.",

The examples presented here illustrate the difficulty in interpreting functional versus phylogenetic similarities of the diverse BH3 sequence motifs reported to date, and in handling the potentially huge number of predicted BH3-containing proteins. More reliable strategies are therefore needed to identify and classify functional BH3 motif-containing proteins by defined and generally acceptable standards. Distinguishing evolutionary similarities (homology) from other similarities (analogy) will be important to achieve a stable classification scheme for the Bcl-2 family.",

Defining BH4 can be further complicated by divergent sequences present on either side of helix 1 (e.g., the long N-terminal extension of Mcl-1 and the large unstructured loop between the BH4 and BH3 of Bcl-x L ) (Figures 2 and S1c in the supplementary information online)",
