These technologies promise to make significant contributions to diagnostic and vaccine development. Researchers in a number of labs have shown that phage selected from libraries with protective antibodies, raised against whole antigen, can be used as immunogens to stimulate antibody responses that bind native antigen and provide protection in vivo. Others have used the sera of patients with idiopathic diseases to screen libraries, and by this approach have identified candidate antigens involved in immune disease. These may prove useful for diagnosis and, possibly, in determining disease etiology.",

Abs also have a variety of uses as biochemical and cellular markers, affinity reagents, diagnostics and therapeutics. Thus, our understanding of the principles governing the interactions of Abs with antigens (Agns) is of great significance to a wide spectrum of research and applications. Phage-display technology has been used to study Ab-Agn interactions with libraries of two types. Random peptide libraries (RPLs) have been used as a source from which peptide ligands can be identified for an Ab, without knowledge of the site on the Agn that the Ab recognizes (the epitope). Agn-fragment libraries (AFLs; also known as gene-fragment libraries) have served as a means of localizing epitopes to specific areas of protein Agns. In this review, we discuss recent progress with RPLs and AFLs in producing Ab-specific markers and epitope mimics, and as tools for mapping protein epitopes. Major focus is also given to the uses and limitations of these technologies in the development of vaccines and diagnostic tools. For brevity's sake, this review does not cover the significant body of work on peptide mimics of carbohydrate, and other non-protein Agns, nor on their development as vaccine and diagnostic leads. We briefly review Ab-protein-Agn interactions, phage-displayed RPLs and AFLs, and phage as immunogens. This is followed by a discussion of recent advances in the use of these libraries in epitope mapping, improvement of affinity, vaccine design, and in the search for pathogens involved in idiopathic disease.",

Agn-Ab interactions have thus provided an excellent model for elucidating the principles of macromolecular recognition, and especially protein-protein recognition. The molecular surfaces mediating contact between an Ab and an Agn are called the paratope and epitope, respectively. The Ab repertoire has evolved to recognize a vast number of epitopes comprising proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and even small chemical compounds (haptens), including man-made ones. As this review focuses primarily on protein Agns, it is important to distinguish between the general types of protein epitopes and the mechanisms by which Abs bind them. Protein epitopes usually bind Ab in three ways.",

These principles are important in understanding the molecular basis by which peptides functionally mimic protein and non-protein epitopes (by binding the same paratope as the 'native' epitope) and structurally mimic them (by making identical contacts with the paratope to those made by the 'native' epitope). The concept of mimicry takes on added complexity in considering how peptide mimics may function as immunogenic mimics that elicit the same Ab as the corresponding epitope on the 'native' immunogen. Considering the simplest case of a peptide that is a structural mimic of much or all of a linear epitope that elicited a given Ab, such a peptide is expected to function as an immunogenic mimic in eliciting that same Ab, given the proper immunization conditions (e.g. structural format of the peptide, carrier protein [including helper-T cell epitopes], adjuvant, genetic background of the animal). However, one can also imagine the situation in which a peptide binds tightly and very specifically to a targeted Ab, producing, say, the same affinity as the native epitope, but via a different network of contacts with the Ab paratope. Would this peptide make a useful immunogenic mimic? The significance of peptides as structural mimics of an epitope versus purely functional mimics (that contact Ab through different interactions from the 'native' epitope) has yet to be clearly defined as it pertains to immunogenic mimicry.",

AFLs are also called 'gene-fragment' libraries, because they are constructed from cDNA fragments generated by digestion with a nonspecific endonuclease [16] . Unlike RPLs, which can be used in a variety of screenings, a new AFL must be built for each target protein analyzed, and the gene for this protein must be cloned.

Although they were able to generate a strong anti-phage Ab response, only marginal titers of Ab were elicited against the peptide, probably because of the low copy number of the peptide per phage. Indeed, Perham's group [10] showed that pVIII-display induces stronger anti-peptide responses upon immunization, even in the absence of an adjuvant. Meola et al. [19] showed that phage displaying a given peptide via fusion to pVIII produced better anti-peptide Ab responses than phage-borne fusion to pIII, recombinant fusion to human H ferritin or the hepatitis B core peptide, or synthetic peptide in the context of a multiple-antigenic peptide. More recently, our work has shown that the use of synthetic peptide conjugated to phage induces even stronger anti-peptide responses than pVIII-displayed recombinant phage, most probably as a result of an even higher copy number of peptide (NE van Houten, MB Zwick, PWHI Parren, DR Burton, JK Scott, unpublished data). However, the phage carrier did not produce as strong an Ab response as the peptide coupled to the classical carrier protein, ovalbumin.",

On direct titration, the b12 Fab bound more tightly to recombinant phage bearing the peptide (100-200 copies per virion) than to phage to which synthetic peptide had been conjugated at a much higher copy number (see 'RPLs and AFLs as a source of ligands for anti-protein Abs.', below). Thus, perhaps a peptide tethered to a flexible linker is less constrained than the same peptide in recombinant form, linked to the phage coat through a less-flexible peptide bond. In support of this observation, Felici et al. [21] found that a MAb, specific for a discontinuous epitope on Bordetella pertusis toxin, would not bind to an RPL-derived synthetic peptide even though it bound tightly to the phage-displayed version of it. Further, a collaboration between Perham's and Opella's groups has revealed, for two different antigenic peptides, that the structure of the peptide fused to pVIII is stable enough to detect by NMR, whereas the synthetic analog of either peptide in solution gives no resolvable structure [22, 23] . Interestingly, the structural stabilization of both peptides appears to derive from only their 'tethered' state (i.e. their peptidyl linkage to the amino terminus of pVIII), and not from other interactions (such as hydrogen bonding) with the phage coat.",

The strength of the Ab response against phage may be, in part, due to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the particulate nature of the filamentous virion. Significant amounts of E. coli LPS are associated with phage; it probably adheres to the phage coat during phage assembly and/or phage extrusion through the pIV-based outer-membrane pore, a gated ion channel [30] . LPS can be removed by subjecting the phage to detergent before precipitation with polyethylene glycol and sodium chloride. Depending on the size of the single-stranded genome it encapsulates, a phage particle can be > 2 \u00b5m long (wildtype phage are ~1 \u00b5m long). We have found that the Ribi Adjuvant System (Sigma # M 6536) enhances the Ab response to fairly low doses of phage (e.g. 10-25 \u00b5g per subcutaneous injection). Small doses of phage may serve to induce higher-affinity Ab responses, because of more efficient competition for antigen in germinal centers.",

[36] showed that a peptide, identified from screening an RPL with a MAb specific for glycoprotein D of herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1, could be used to confer protective immunity to HSV-1 infection. Moreover, the affinity of the MAb for both the RPL-derived peptide and the 10-residue native linear epitope (mapped with the peptide) were approximately equal, suggesting that the CBRs had been identified. Bastien et al. [37] conferred immunity to respiratory syncytial virus by immunizing mice with phage displaying (via pIII) a previously identified, protective epitope (173-187) of its glycoprotein G. These experiments laid the foundation for the concept that linear epitopes, both from RPLs and AFLs, could induce neutralizing Ab production. Further evidence supporting this has been obtained by Grabowska et al. [38] , who originally mapped a linear epitope on HSV-2 using an RPL and pepscanning. More recently, they showed that immunization of mice with the phage-displayed peptides conferred protective immunity against challenge with a lethal dose of HSV-2, and that survival was dependent on the amount of phage used for immunization [39 \u2022 ]. In similar work, Yu et al. [40 \u2022 ] used protective MAbs that recognize discontinuous (one MAb) and linear (two MAbs) epitopes on the surface-glycoprotein (surface glycoprotein) of murine coronavirus to screen a panel of RPLs. Although all three MAbs isolated binding phage, only one of the selected clones (which mimicked a continuous epitope on the surface-glycoprotein) induced a statistically-significant protective immune response. Interestingly, phage bearing the same consensus sequence as the protective clone, but different flanking sequences, did not induce protective immunity, indicating an important role for the regions flanking the consensus sequence in inducing cross-reactive Abs. Thus, protective Ab responses have been induced by phage-displayed peptides; however, in all the cases mentioned, the immunogenic-mimic peptides corresponded to linear protein epitopes on the cognate pathogens.",

Both mimics of linear and discontinuous epitopes were identified, and immunization of rabbits with some of these phage resulted in HCV-cross-reactive Ab production. Following this approach, Scala et al. [42 \u2022 ] screened two RPLs with serum Abs from HIV-1-infected people and identified phage that reacted with multiple sera. These phage were then used to immunize mice, and the sera from several mice was shown to stain immunoblots of the HIV-1 envelope proteins. Importantly, affinity-purified IgGs from the several mice neutralized HIV-1 primary isolates in an in vitro infection assay using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.",

Although they found peptide mimics of epitopes on T4 phage from both types of library, and both types of mimic were able to elicit significant Ab responses, only the AFL-derived peptides were able to elicit Abs that strongly bound T4 phage, when tested in a stringent in vitro assay. From this, the authors concluded that AFLs constitute a more useful source of immunogenic-mimic peptides than RPLs.

In many cases, there are multiple sites of neutralization that are immunodominant on the Agn or organism, making neutralizing Abs relatively straightforward to elicit. However, if the protein or the organism is difficult to produce, or if neutralization sites are not immunodominant, then the approach of identifying epitope-mimic peptides to serve as immunogenic mimics may be useful. In these cases, it would be helpful to use neutralizing MAbs for the search (rather than PCAbs), so as to limit the epitope-mimics obtained to those involved in neutralization. HIV-1 infection is such a case; although a strong Ab response is elicited against the viral envelope proteins, rarely are broadly neutralizing specificities produced in significant amounts. Moreover, many of the anti-envelope-protein Abs produced bind the envelope proteins in free form, but will not bind them in the context of the viral envelope [33] .",

They screened an RPL with the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, which often contains high concentrations of oligoclonal Abs, whose specificity and role in MS is unknown. Phage displaying the selected peptides were shown to react with both the serum and the CSF of the same patient, as well as with the serum of other MS patients and normal patients, but only sometimes showed cross-reactivity with the CSF of other MS patients. Such reactivity indicates that the CSF Abs from different MS patients did not have the same specificity (the Abs probably resulted from nonspecific immunodysregulation), and that the peptides may be mimicking ubiquitous Agns, not essential to the disease state at the time of the analysis. In further work, Cortese et al [44 \u2022 \u2022 ] studied a phage-displayed peptide, representative of a family of peptides selected with the common motif Lys-Pro-Pro-Asn-Pro. As this was the dominant motif identified, the sera were further tested for their ability to bind a panel of neurotropic viruses. Interestingly, a phage clone, selected for its good reactivity to CSF Abs and sera of MS patients, was shown to cross-react with an epitope present in the envelope glycoprotein B of HSV-1. Moreover, Abs generated against this clone identified a brain-specific protein by Western blot. This brain protein, thus, may be a putative target for HSV-1-induced autoimmune Ab responses. Importantly, this approach may reveal evidence supporting the long-held hypothesis that common viral infections trigger the production of self-reactive CSF Abs in MS.",

Thus, Abs elicited against a phagedisplayed, epitope-mimic peptide cross-react with the native epitope in the context of the whole Agn or pathogen. The basis of such cross-reactivity is unclear. It is apparent, however, that the structure of recombinant peptide is influenced by fusion to the phage coat, and as such, synthetic peptides conjugated to carrier may not be as effective as recombinant phage in inducing cross-reacting Abs [20] . More stringent assays of cross-reactivity are required in assessing the success of an epitope-mimic peptide, whether it be from a RPL or an AFL. Studies should be undertaken to analyze the V genes and structure of the Abs that have been induced by immunization with an epitope-mimic peptide, to allow its comparison with the MAb used to select it. Also needed are structures of the screening MAb, both free and bound to native Agn and to peptide mimic, as well as the corresponding structures of the bound and free MAbs elicited by the immunogenicmimic peptides. Such work should establish whether peptides can indeed be used to elicit the same or similar Abs as those used in the initial peptide selection.

Lower sequence homology, however, was found in the hypervariable regions (especially in CDR-H3), and preliminary structural models suggested significant differences in the Ab combining sites. The best example of immunogenic mimicry of a discontinuous protein epitope comes from Goldbaum et al. [48] . Their work, however, involved not peptides, but anti-idiotypic Abs raised against a MAb. Following the network theory of Jerne and others [50] , they used the well-characterized murine MAb D1.3, which binds a discontinuous epitope on hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL), to immunize mice. An anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) MAb was shown by crystallographic study to behave similar to HEL, in binding the D1.3 paratope via many of the same contacts as HEL. Further, anti-anti-Id Abs raised in mice using rabbit PCAbs against D.13 were also shown to behave as D1.3, in binding HEL, and the anti-Id MAb, via many of the same contacts as D1.3. The K d of the D1.3-HEL interaction was 1 \u00d7 10 -8 M, whereas those of HEL with the two anti-anti-Id MAbs were 1.8 \u00d7 10 -6 M and 3.8 \u00d7 10 -6 M; moreover, the V gene usage, including the HCDR-3 region, of the anti-anti-Id MAbs were very similar to those of D.13. Thus, even though there was significant affinity of the anti-anti-Id MAbs for HEL, it was still lower than that of D1.3 for HEL, and the affinity of the anti-anti-Id MAbs for the epitopemimic (anti-Id) MAb was greater than the cross-reactivity with HEL.

Careful study of the structural and functional features of ligand-peptides and the Abs they bind should clarify the underlying mechanisms behind the development of epitope-targeted vaccine and diagnostic approaches. A protocol that introduces mutations and extends the size of a target sequence, selected from phage-displayed RPLs, was developed to identify improved ligands for HCV-specific serum Abs. The addition of residues at both the peptide amino-and carboxy-terminus (closer to the phage surface) was shown to improve the interaction between peptide and HCV-specific serum Abs; these additions may increase the accessibility of the target sequence at the phage surface, increase the number of residues involved in the binding interaction, contribute to the peptide conformation, or improve phage viability. The authors mapped the accessible surface of filamentous bacteriophage fd particles using polyclonal rabbit serum and three mouse MAbs raised against complete phage. By Western blot analysis, their study identified the major structural component of phage, pVIII (the major coat protein), to be the antigen. (The amino terminus of the pVIII subunit is located at the surface of the virion and consists of an amphipathic helix.) Further, by spot synthesis of overlapping peptides (covering the sequence of pVIII) on cellulose membranes they showed that the three mouse MAbs interacted with a core of 10 amino acid residues located near the amino terminus of pVIII and that extension of the amino terminus did not inhibit binding. Similarly, the rabbit polyclonal Abs recognized a core of 12 amino acids near the amino terminus of pVIII. Subsequently, to define the minimal length of each epitope, a set of amino-terminal peptides containing individual amino acids substituted with glycine, were synthesized. Interestingly, the essential residues identified corresponded with the helical conformation of the amino terminus of pVIII. Five, 10-residue libraries,that together spanned the 50-residue pVIII sequence of M13, were constructed such that most residues were fully or partially randomized. Only the lysine residues, believed to interact with the negatively charged DNA of the phage particle, were not mutated. Interestingly, very few wild-type residues were highly conserved in the first 30 residues at the amino terminus of pVIII, with only Ala10 being completely conserved. The last 20 residues of pVIII, however, appeared intolerant to mutation as no selectants were identified from the libraries spanning those residues (only contaminants from other libraries were identified). Variants of pVIII were shown to increase the display of two different recombinant proteins. The authors showed that bacteriophage displaying RT2, a peptide epitope of the reverse transcriptase of HIV-1, were able to prime an Agn-specific CTL response both in vitro and in vivo. Successful priming also required a T helper epitope; they used pep23, an immunodominant B cell and T helper epitope, also found on HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. It was shown that the T helper epitope could by supplied either on the same or a separate bacteriophage. As expected, their experiments showed that priming of CTLs required expression of pep23 and RT2 on the surface of the same APC. It is unknown, however, how the phage virions were able to target both class I and class II MHC compartments.",

It was determined that about 1% of the produced phage displayed at least one peptide-MHC complex. Also demonstrated was specific binding of the phage-displayed peptide-MHC complex to immobilized recombinant T cell receptors (TCRs) and the TCRs of T-cell hybridomas. Because of the low affinity of the interaction between TCRs and peptide-MHC complexes, and their rapid dissociation, achieving a higher copy number of phage-displayed peptide-MHC complex will be critical for the successful screening of libraries on immobilized TCR.",

The peptides selected with the chicken and horse Abs mostly differed in their minimal overlapping residues, possibly because of intrinsic genetic differences between the two immune systems",

Interestingly, the most antigenic clone, when used as an immunogen, was the least able to induce cross-reacting Abs with the native Agn (glycoprotein G). The phage preparations were administered without adjuvant and the overall levels of Ab were lower in mice given phage preparations that had been pre-absorbed against polymixin B (to remove LPS) than those given samples that hadn't been pre-absorbed; this suggests that LPS provides adjuvant activity to the phage immunogen. The authors noted a variability in the survival of mice between experiments, and suggest that minor differences in the age and size of the animals",

Thus, RPLs were thus screened with HIV-1 positive sera (and counterscreened with HIV-1 negative sera) to select peptides; the phage-displayed peptides were shown to behave as both antigenic and immunogenic mimics of linear and discontinuous HIV-1 epitopes. Of significance, the peptides, when used as immunogens in mice, elicited HIV-1 specific Abs that neutralized HIV-1 isolates in vitro. Also of interest is that the peptides were recognized by the sera of simian HIV-infected monkeys and the sera from long-term nonprogressor individuals showed higher Ab titers to certain epitopes",

Thus, the filamentous phage have the potential to serve as a carrier for responses against both foreign T cell and B cell epitopes. To optimize the phage carrier, immunogenic peptides that are endogenous to phage should be minimized or removed altogether (so called 'de-immunization'), so that the target epitopes, introduced by recombinant means, would be fully immunodominant.

Fierabracci A, Biro PA, Yiangou Y, Mennuni C, Luzzago A, \u2022 Ludvigsson J, Cortese R, Bottazzo GF: Osteopontin is an autoantigen of the somatostatin cells in human islets: identification by screening random peptide libraries with sera of patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Vaccine 1999, 18:342-354. The authors used sera from IDDM patients to screen an RPL in an attempt to identify novel pancreatic islet-related epitopes associated with IDDM. Their screening involved three steps: first, screening with a single serum; second, screening of the enriched phage with two additional serum with different autoantibody specificities (so that the enriched phage are commonly recognized by Abs in all 3 sera); and third, screening and counter-screening with sera from other patients and normal controls. One identified clone, CH1p, was detected by 70% of newly diagnosed IDDM patient sera compared with only 10% of normal sera. Rabbit sera raised against the MAP-conjugated CH1p synthetic peptide selected three clones from a cDNA-expression library constructed from human islet cells; the sequence of this peptide shared 99% homology with that of human osteopontin. However, a radioimmunoassay using recombinant human osteopontin from bone revealed that only ~7% of IDDM sera may contain anti-osteopontin Abs. On the basis of the data presented in the paper, osteopontin is probably an autoantigen, but it is not involved in a common pathogenic mechanism underlying IDDM. The authors demonstrated the usefulness of screening RPLs with serum Abs from infected individuals, even without prior knowledge of the pathogen or its antigenic structure, for 'epitope discovery' and the identification of diagnostic peptides. Twelve RPLs were screened to select peptides recognized by Lyme-disease related Abs but not by background Abs present in negative sera samples. The 22 potential diagnostic peptides identified in the study fell into eight sequence motifs. Interestingly, peptides of the same motif showed similar binding patterns of reactivity with different sera samples but this was not true for peptides with different motifs; this suggests that the sequence motifs represented functional motifs.",
