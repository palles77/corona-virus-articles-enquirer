However, there have been few confirmed reports of FIP in non-domestic felids (Stephenson et al., 2013) . There has been some confusion in the diagnosis of FIP in African lions. Clinical FIP was reported in two lions in a zoo in the USA and was the first indication that FIP may occur in feline species other than domestic felids (Colby, 1970; Colby and Low, 1970) . FIP was also reported in three lions in a zoo in South Africa (Robison et al., 1971) . However, although these reports used the common name \"lion\", the scientific name was not mentioned. Therefore, we cannot confirm whether these cases were African lions. There have been no confirmed reports in African lions to date.",

It is hoped that further investigations will add to the info8rmation about the susceptibility to FIP and the ocular manifestation of FIP in this species. As far as we know, this is the first confirmed case of FIP in an African lion and of ocular FIP in a non-domestic felid.",
