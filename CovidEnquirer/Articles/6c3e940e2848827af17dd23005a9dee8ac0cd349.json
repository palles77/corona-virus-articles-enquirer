The real danger posed by ZIKV is neurological defects like microcephaly and Guillain-Barre syndrome in newborns as well as in adults respectively (3, 4) . Epidemiological studies have also reported sexual mode of ZIKV transmission is further raising the threat alarm worldwide (5) . As on 1st February 2016, the World Health Organization has called a global health emergency that demands the development of safe and effective therapeutics. In 2017, WHO has confirmed three cases of ZIKV in Ahmedabad District, Gujarat, State, India (http://www.who.int/). A recent ZIKV outbreak in 2018 has been observed in India where more than 200 zika cases were confirmed including pregnant women. There is an urgency to develop antivirals against ZIKV. In past months, several bioactive molecules have been assayed either against ZIKV proteins or targeting cellular proteins by employing different approaches like screening new compound libraries or using drug repurposing (6, 7) . Another essential aspect in drug discovery that could not be ignored is the use of natural products which are known to possess enormous structural and chemical variety over any other synthetic compound library (8) . Moreover, natural products deliver a crucial advantage of being pre-selected evolutionary with optimized chemical structures against biological targets (9) .",

The antiviral role of EGCG has been well demonstrated against several viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza virus (FLU), DENV and chikungunya virus, etc (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . In a recent study, EGCG has shown a strong virucidal effect against ZIKV with a probable mechanism related to inhibiting entry into host cell demonstrated by computational finding (16, 17) . However, reports suggest that apart from viral entry inhibition EGCG can also block essential steps in the replication cycle of some viruses (10) . Due to the lack of complete understanding of EGCG inhibition mechanism on ZIKV, we designed our study to find a specific viral protein which could be targeted by EGCG. We have chosen NS3 helicase protein of ZIKV, a crucial enzyme in viral replication which unwinds genomic RNA after deriving energy from intrinsic nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase) activity (18, 19) . In addition to RNA unwinding activity, flavivirus helicases have also been reported to participate in other vital functions such as ribosome biogenesis, pre-mRNA splicing, RNA export and degradation, RNA maturation as well as translation etc (20) . Hence, essential functions of these helicases are making them attractive drug targets.",

Full-length NS3 protein has N-terminal protease activity, and C-terminal is associated with helicase activity. ZIKV NS3 helicase (172-617 residues) is a large protein containing three domains where domain 1 (residues175-332) and domain 2 (residues 333-481) forms NTPase pocket and domain 3 (residues 481-617) in association with domain 1 and 2 forms RNA binding tunnel (21) . Though ZIKV helicase is well structured, active sites at NTPase and RNA binding pockets contain highly flexible or disordered P-loop (193-203 residues) and RNA binding loop (244-255 residues) respectively, which are critical for their specific function (21, 22) . In general, past decade has evidenced the significance contribution of intrinsically disordered proteins/regions (IDRs/IDPs) in almost all biological processes and the regions are considered as novel therapeutic targets (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) . Despite the conversed active site amino acid residues among flavivirus helicases, ZIKV helicase show different motor domain movements and RNA binding modes when compared to DENV helicase (21) . These vital functions of ZIKV helicase encourage to screen for antiviral molecules against its active sites. In a recent study, we have determine the inhibitory potential of a small molecule (HCQ) against ZIKV protease with computational and enzyme kinetics studies (30) . Therefore, in this article, we have used molecular docking and simulation approach to find out a significant binding cavity for EGCG. Further, we have verified our computational findings by in vitro enzyme assay to probe the significant binding of EGCG at NTPase site of ZIKV helicase.",

Similarly, another crystal structure has ssRNA bound at helicase active site which appears suitable for employing virtual screening protocol (as shown in figure 2A ). We have used extra precision (XP) mode in glide suite of Schr\u00f6dinger to dock EGCG firstly at ATPase site and after that at helicase site (as shown in figure 1 and figure 2 respectively). After docking, the extent of EGCG binding at ATPase site was represented in terms of docking score as shown in table 1. A significant docking score (-7.8 Kcal mol -1 ) was observed which is contributed by various hydrogen bonding interactions with key residues of ATPase site such as ARG (202), THR (201), GLY (197), ASN (463), and ASN (417) (as shown in figure 1B, 1C and table1). Another important interaction was observed with ARG (462) which shows salt bridge and Pi-cation bonding with EGCG ( figure 1B and 1C ). More importantly, these interactions were reported at the critical P-loop (residues193-203) and motif VI (residues Q455, R459, and R462) of NTPase binding pocket. Mechanistic studies have already shown that P-loop residues play the most significant contribution in NTP binding and further hydrolysis (21, 31) .",

The glide XP docking poses of EGCG and helicase protein at both binding sites (NTPase and RNA binding site) were used for estimating binding energies by using the Prime suite. In table1, binding energies for EGCG at RNA binding site (-51.312 kcal/mol) was shown which seems slightly higher than at ATPase site (-47.324 kcal/mol). These results show that EGCG molecule can bind at both active sites of NS3 helicase. Further, ADME properties for EGCG molecules were calculated as reported previously by Sharma et al., (2017) (17) . Except, low oral absorption value, rest of the ADME properties of EGCG were within range to declare this molecule as a safe drug candidate. In support of this, a study on cell lines has reported that EGCG is only cytotoxic at concentrations greater than 200uM (16) .",

            "text": "Molecular dynamics simulation studies help in understanding the protein structurefunction such as folding, conformational flexibility, and stability. Hence, we have performed the MD simulations on the apo ZIKV helicase and compared the protein stability when EGCG bound at NTPase site and RNA binding site for a period of 100ns ( Figure 3 and Figure 4 respectively). In figure 3A , the analysis of C-\u03b1 root mean square deviations (RMSD) portrays that the apo ZIKV helicase represented in black did not seem to be stable enough (RMSD =1.75 -2.75 \u00c5) throughout the simulation when compared to the EGCG-NTPase complex represented in red (RMSD = 1.5 \u00c5 to 2.25 \u00c5). Initially the EGCG complex was showing similar fluctuations like apo helicase but after 65 ns the complex was observed to achieve its stability till the completion of simulation course period. In order to understand the conformational fluctuations upon EGCG binding at NTPase pocket, C-\u03b1 root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) at single residue level were compared between apo helicase and complex ( Figure 3B ). In Figure 3B , it was observed that the region around 248-255 was showng higher fluctuations of 4.75 \u00c5 in EGCG complex and lower fluctuations of 2.75 \u00c5 were monitored in region 320-326 in EGCG complex as compared to apo helicase. Notably, studies have shown that the region 248-255 belongs to RNA binding loop (244-255) which is highly dynamic and stabilized after RNA binding (21, 32) . Interestingly, it was noticed that P-loop region (193-203) was not showing fluctuations in EGCG complex and apo helicase as well. Since dynamic P-loop is critical for ATP hydrolysis, it may be concluded that EGCG stabilizes the P-loop dynamics by forming significant interactions with key residues as observed in simulation interaction diagram ( Figure S1C ). In Figure 3C , compactness of the protein structure was measured by comparing the radius of gyration (R g ) in apo helicase and EGCG complex. It was observed that the compactness of protein was maintained stably throughout 100ns simulation period in EGCG complex as compared to apo helicase. This also shows that the dynamic NTPase site is also controlling the overall shape of protein and EGCG is probably stabilising the NTPase site that further maintaining the overall compactness. Further, the analysis of secondary structure elements ( Figure S1A ) revealed that the region 180-185, 300-310, 330-350 and 450-470 shows unstable conformation throughout the simulation time. More deeply, in figure S1B the timeline of percentage index of total contacts was represented and analysis revealed that ARG 462, THR 201, GLU 286 and ARG 459 had retained the contacts throughout simulation period. In figure 3D , the interaction histogram in combination with 2D simulation interaction diagram ( Figure  S1D ) was showing fraction of different interactions (H-bond, hydrophobic, ionic and water bridges) between EGCG and NTPase site residues. It was observed that residues GLU 286 and THR 201 have ionic interaction contribution of 100 %, while ARG 462, ARG 459 and GLY 199 shows the hydrogen bond interaction of more than 70% of simulation time. Figure  1C was showing maintenance of Hbonding throughout the simulation.",

            "text": "In our docking studies, we have observed that EGCG can also bind to the RNA binding cavity near entry site with significant interactions (Figure 2 and Table1). Therefore, we have run the MD simulations for apo helicase and EGCG complex at RNA binding site to compare the overall protein stability and residue level interactions (Figure 4 and Figure S2 ). The RMSD graph ( Figure 4A ) revealed that the apoprotein was showing deviation upto 20ns and attained a stable trajectory after 20ns till it reached 50ns whereas after 55ns again the deviation gradually increased by RMSD of 2.5 \u00c5. In case of EGCG complex at RNA binding site, the deviation of complex was started increasing upto 2.5 \u00c5 till 25ns and thereafter a decrease in RMSD (2.2 \u00c5) was observed and maintained throughout100ns period. This graph was showing that EGCG binding at the RNA site stabilising the overall protein conformation. In figure  4B , the comparison of RMSF was revealing that the higher fluctuations of almost 3.5 \u00c5 were observed in region 320-326 in apo helicase which were further reduced to 2.0 \u00c5 in EGCG-RNA site complex. Interestingly it was noticed that region 248-255 was showing higher fluctuations of 4.75 \u00c5 in EGCG complex at NTPase site ( Figure 3B ) in comparison to EGCG complex at RNA site ( Figure  4B ) which was showing similar fluctuations of 2.75 \u00c5 like apo helicase. Overall, the RMSF plot of EGCG-RNA site complex was found to support RMSD graph. As already mentioned before, region 248-255 contains crucial RNA binding loop which is important for helicase activity (21) . From above comparisons, it may be interpreted as EGCG binding at NTPase site may lead to the conformational changes at RNA binding loop region (244-255) which otherwise were not observed when EGCG bound at RNA site. Further in figure 4C , the radius of the gyration plot was showing that EGCG complex at RNA site had maintained compactness throughout the 100ns period as compared to apo helicase. In figure 4D , the different types of interaction fractions were observed that showed mostly H-bonded interactions were prominent between EGCG and protein. In Figure S2A , the extent of formation of secondary structure elements was analysed when EGCG bound to RNA site throughout 100ns simulation period. Further, it was noticed that H-bonding was maintained throughout the simulation ( Figure S2C ) and mostly residues GLU 413, MET 414 were continuously contacted throughout while residues LYS 431, PHE289 and ASP 410 were showing irregular contacts ( Figure S2B and S2D ). This residues observed in interaction with EGCG at RNA site, have essential role already mentioned in crystal structure of helicase with RNA (21) . For example, LYS410 and ASP410 shows important interaction with RNA sugar bases. Hence our simulation study shows that EGCG may have the capability to significantly bind at RNA site also along with NTPase site.",

Also, the major complications of ZIKV infections are related to pregnant women, therefor it is important to find molecules which are safe and have minimal or no side-effects. Considering the safety point, natural products have always been a great source of drugs or drug like molecules and also these molecules have evolutionary preoptimized biological targets (8) . To find specific biological targets, in silico structure-based drug discovery approaches have revolutionized and fasten the current drug developing strategies. In fact, the molecules which can target specifically viral proteins could act as safe therapeutics against ZIKV (34) . EGCG, a green tea polyphenol has shown significant antiviral activity against several viruses including HIV, HSV, CHIKV and some flaviviruses like HCV, and DENV (10) . Recently, in ZIKV, EGCG inhibitory potential was determined in a cell line based study where probable mechanism was related to interaction of the compound with envelope protein (16) . Previously, we have also supported the EGCG envelope protein interaction with computational study (17) . However, reports suggested that EGCG may target other viral proteins which are important in genome replication and maturation (10) . Due to lack of adequate experimental support regrading EGCG envelope protein interactions and considering the possibility of finding more specific target for EGCG, we have chosen NS3 helicase protein of ZIKV for determining potential inhibitory effects of EGCG. NS3 helicase of ZIKV is an attractive drug target due to its essential role in opening RNA secondary structures during replication (21) . Also, reports suggest that EGCG has shown anti-ATPase activity against bacterial DNA gyrases(33).",

            "text": "In ZIKV NS3 helicase the RNA binding site along with NTPase site has flexible pockets containing critical loop regions needed to perform function (21, 22) . Therefore, we also studied the possibility of EGCG interacting at RNA binding site. This was due to the fact that polyphenols have shown potential interactions with intrinsically disordered regions in proteins and could be seen as novel strategies of drug development against IDPs (38) . Also, literature has shown that viral proteins have several short stretches of disordered regions within proteins and more propensity of intrinsically disordered active sites (22, 24, 39) . Our docking and MD simulations studies are showing that EGCG has the ability to bind at the entry site of RNA binding pocket with significant interactions. More specifically, EGCG is showing different types of interactions (H-bond, ionic, salt bridge) with residues GLU 413, MET 414, LYS 431, PHE289 and ASP 410. In crystal structure, these residues are playing key role in binding to RNA (21) . In our MD simulations, it has also reported that EGCG binding at NTPase site is increasing fluctuations in RNA site which could interpreted as an allosteric relationship between two sites. This observation could be supported by the recent study on DENV helicase where NTPase and RNA sites show allosteric effects.",

Interestingly, the comparison with previous studies illustrate that EGCG can target multiple viral protein such as envelope (16) , protease (37) and now more precisely helicase. Since EGCG has shown virucidal effect against several viruses, therefore EGCG backbone could be used to develop a broad-spectrum antiviral molecule in near future.",

Further, the docking process was initiated by following a series of necessary steps such as protein preparation, receptor grid generation, ligand preparation and finally ligand docking. Protein preparation was carried out by using Protein Preparation wizard in Schrodinger LLC Maestro v11.0. In protein preparation, force field OPLS-2005 was utilized for H-bond network optimization and energy minimization. Cocrystallization artifacts such as missing side chains and loops were filled by using Prime. Protonation states were generated using Epik at pH 7.4. In literature, three crystal water molecules were reported at the substrate binding site, therefore except these water molecules rest were deleted beyond 5 \u00c5 from the ligand. A receptor grid was generated on the centroid of substrate binding site by picking up the atoms of co-crystallized ligand (ATP) in 5GJC and ssRNA in 5GJB. The length of the grid was kept 20 \u00c5. Before final docking step, EGCG molecule was also prepared using LigPrep module of Maestro as described by Sharma et. al. Further, ligand docking was carried out by using extra precision glide (Glide XP) program from Schrodinger (Glide, Version 11). EGCG molecule was docked flexibly at rigid active site on the protein.

A) Purification of NS3 helicase by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. A 10% SDS gel was run and stained with Coomassie dye where final his-tagged NS3 helicase fractions were pooled and concentrated by Amicon (10kDa) centrifugal filter. In this figure, Mprotein ladder (Bio-Rad Precision Plus) and L1 contains purified concentrated his-tagged NS3 helicase protein of ZIKV B) Kinetic parameters (Substrate-Velocity curve) calculated for 80 nM NS3 helicase after varying the substrate (ATP) concentration ranging from 50 \u00b5M to 2500 \u00b5M. C) IC50 calculated for EGCG against NTPase site by incubating 80 nM helicase with varying concentration of EGCG (serially diluted: 1200 nM: 23.40 nM) D) Inhibition constant (Ki) was calculated for 80nM helicase at different concentration of ATP (100, 150, 250, 400, 600 and 1000 \u00b5M) and EGCG concentrations were kept at 0.5 and 0.25 \u00b5M. author/funder.
