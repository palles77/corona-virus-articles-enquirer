            "text": "Background: The protocols of WHO network laboratories facilitated development of rapid diagnosis for SARS coronavirus (CoV) using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays. However, several reports have shown that conventional and real-time PCR assays were very specific for SARS CoV but lack sensitivity depending on the assay, specimen, and time course of disease. Objective: To evaluate an automatic nucleic acid extraction system and two standardized real-time PCR assays for rapid diagnosis of SARS CoV during outbreak and post-epidemic periods in Hong Kong. Study design: Specimens from clinically suspected SARS patients collected during outbreak and post-epidemic periods were tested by an automatic nucleic acid extraction system followed by our first generation conventional RT-PCR and two standardized real-time PCR assays (Artus GmbH, Germany and Roche Diagnostics, Germany). Paired serum samples were assayed for increasing titer against SARS CoV. Results: In the SARS epidemic, Artus and Roche PCR assays exhibited sensitivities of 87% and 85% for respiratory specimens (n = 64), 91% and 88% for stool (n = 44), and 82% for urine (n = 29). A specificity of 100% was exhibited by both PCR assays except Artus attained only a 92% specificity for stool. For post-epidemic period, no SARS CoV was identified among 56 respiratory specimens by all PCR assays. Inhibitors to PCR assays were detected at an average rate of 7-8% among 202 clinical specimens. Conclusion: This study highlights the high throughput and performance of automatic RNA extraction in coordination with standardized real-time PCR assays suitable for large-scale routine diagnosis in case of future SARS epidemic. As no SARS CoV was detected among specimens collected during post-epidemic period, the positive predictive value of real-time PCR assays for detection of SARS CoV during low epidemic requires further evaluation.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is the first pandemic infectious disease of the new millennium, which is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS CoV). This pathogen swept across almost all the continents of the globe, and has currently involved 33 countries and regions, including the mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, North America and Europe (Drosten et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003a; Tsang et al., 2003) . In Hong Kong, as a result of reductions in population contact rates and improved hospital infection control, the epidemic was shown to decline (Riley et al., 2003) . The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that there were 8439 cases of SARS with 812 deaths at the end of the transmission cycle in 2003 (available from URL: www.who.int/csr/sars/country/2003 07 11/en/). Control of the spread of disease relies on rapid diagnosis and appropriate clinical management. Early and reliable detection of the SARS CoV in clinical specimens will determine which patients presenting with fever should be immediately isolated and managed according to strict procedures of infection control. The protocols of WHO network laboratories (available from URL: http://www.who.int/csr/sars/primers/en) facilitated development of rapid diagnosis for SARS CoV using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays. However, several reports have shown that conventional and real-time PCR assays were very specific for SARS CoV but lack sensitivity depending on the assay, specimen, and time course of disease (Peiris et al., 2003b; Poon et al., 2003a; Yam et al., 2003) . This study evaluated an automatic nucleic acid extraction system in coordination with two commercial real-time PCR assays used during this SARS outbreak and post-epidemic periods in Hong Kong.",

For each patient, paired acute-and convalescent-phase serum samples and at least one respiratory specimen were collected for study. Respiratory specimens were collected between days 1 and 5 after admission, whereas urine and stool specimens were collected between days 5 and 10. The acute-phase sera were collected in the first week of illness, and the convalescentphase sera were collected 21 days after the onset of clinical symptoms. Respiratory specimens were assessed by rapid direct immunofluorescent antigen detection for influenza virus types A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and adenovirus (Chan et al., 2002 (Chan et al., , 2004 . Paired serum samples were assayed for increasing titer against SARS CoV as described previously (Chan et al., 2004; Yam et al., 2003) . Nine nasopharyngeal aspirate from patients suffering from unrelated diseases were collected as controls. A clinical isolate of SARS CoV (HKU39849) and two human coronaviruses (OC43 and 229E) were used as positive and negative controls for subsequent PCR assays. After the last reported case of confirmed SARS in early June, another 56 respiratory specimens (45 nasopharyngeal aspirate and 11 throat swab) were also collected from clinically suspected SARS patients during August and September 2003.",

None of the common viral pathogens including influenza virus types A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1,2, and 3 RSV, and adenovirus was detected among 64 respiratory specimens. Using seroconversion as the gold standard for SARS diagnosis, the WHO first generation RT-PCR assay (WHO-HKU) exhibited a sensitivity of 72% (respiratory specimens), 72% (stool), and 59% (urine) with a 100% specificity for all specimens. Sensitivities of Artus and Roche real-time PCR assays were found to be 87% and 85% for respiratory specimens, 91% and 88% for stool, and 82% for urine. A specificity of 100% was exhibited by both real-time PCR assays except Artus attained only a 92% specificity for stool. For real-time PCR assays, viral RNA detected in clinical samples ranged from 0.13 to 10 6 copies for Artus and 0.44 to 10 8 copies for Roche assays. In Fig. 1 , high concordance of results was exhibited by both real-time PCR assays for 134 specimens ( ). Artus detected SARS CoV RNA in two specimens ( ) of SARS-confirmed patients at 1.8 and 0.13 copies whereas Roche PCR assay was negative for these two specimens.

            "text": "Sero-diagnosis for SARS CoV infection is reliable and specific but sero-conversion can only be detected around day 10 of illness and, in some patients, especially if they have been treated with immunomodulator drugs such as steroids, may be delayed until the third or fourth week of the illness (Peiris et al., 2003b; Poon et al., 2003a) . The case-exclusion criteria is defined by absence of antibody to SARS CoV in convalescent-phase serum samples obtained >28 days after symptoms onset. To serve the purpose of rapid diagnosis, first generation in-house RT-PCR (WHO-HKU) assay launched for routine application has been shown to be highly specific but insensitive (Yam et al., 2003; Chan et al., 2004) . In the previous study, manual RNA extraction was performed (QIAamp viral RNA kits, Hilden, Germany) using 140 L sample volume. However, the WHO-HKU assay exhibited a higher sensitivity in this study when compared to previous finding, which is probably accounted by the more efficient robotic system using a larger initial sample volume (220 L) for viral RNA extraction. Standardized PCR assays are expected to facilitate rapid diagnosis of SARS CoV in routine practice. In this study, both commercial real-time PCR assays were significantly more sensitive than WHO-HKU assay as the latter missed mainly samples with low copy numbers of SAR CoV RNA. Artus PCR assay has been shown to detect SARS CoV RNA from 10 4 to 10 9 copies/g lung tissue of SARS patients (Mazzulli et al., 2004) ; this study further illustrated the sensitivity of real-time PCR assays for specimens with low viral load. Recently, the detection limit of Roche and Artus assays was found to be 3982 copies/mL and 37.8 copies/mL, respectively (Hourfar et al., 2004) , which may account for the slightly higher diagnostic sensitivity of Artus over Roche in this study. Using the LightCycler system, the real-time PCR assay generates quantitative results within 1 h, which is much shorter than traditional PCR reactions. As the WHO-HKU protocol is a two-step RT-PCR assay, onestep real-time RT-PCR assays are more suitable for routine diagnostic application to reduce risk of cross contamination. One false positive result was exhibited by the Artus assay, indicating the high specificity of PCR assays for SARS CoV and minimal cross contamination introduced by the robotic system during viral RNA extraction from clinical specimens. Recent study used samples from confirmed SARS patients to verify higher sensitivity of both Roche and Artus assays over first generation tests (Drosten et al., 2004) ; this study further elucidates the specificity of both commercial real-time PCR assays suitable for routine application. The detection rate of PCR inhibitors remained moderately low, demonstrating that coordination of automatic RNA extraction system and realtime PCR assays are efficient for routine screening of SARS CoV with less technologist time. For routine diagnosis, in case of presence of PCR inhibitor, a second sample will be requested immediately to repeat the PCR assay. In our laboratory, one technologist/scientist can perform RNA extraction and real-time PCR assays for 96 samples in a working day (data not shown). We have conveyed another study using stored clinical samples, an in-house real-time PCR assay and four times volume of respiratory specimen for manual viral RNA extraction . Sensitivity of the assay was comparable to the two commercial PCR assays in this study; however, effect of PCR inhibitors due to increase of initial sample volume for RNA extraction was not evaluated in the previous study. It has been shown earlier that testing more than one respiratory specimen will maximize the sensitivity of PCR assays, it was not assessed in this study due to limited supply of commercial kits (Yam et al., 2003) . Rapid diagnosis of SARS CoV by PCR assays is useful during an epidemic. During post-epidemic period, no SARS CoV was detected by all PCR assays used in this study. To monitor reemerging of SARS CoV infection, rapid diagnosis is important not only for timely therapeutic intervention but also for the identification of a beginning outbreak, positive predictive value of PCR assay for a sporadic case with no epidemiological link to other cases such as the recent SARS in southern China requires further investigation (available from URL: http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004 01 05/en/). Nevertheless, detection and quantification of SARS CoV by real-time PCR assays are relevant for rapid diagnosis and treatment planning. To avoid a false alarm for contingency plan towards SARS CoV epidemic, initial positive laboratory tests need validation by a second laboratory in the same region or a repeated PCR assay on another target. Our study highlights the high throughput and performance of automatic RNA extraction and standardized real-time PCR assays suitable for largescale routine diagnosis in case of future SARS epidemic.",
