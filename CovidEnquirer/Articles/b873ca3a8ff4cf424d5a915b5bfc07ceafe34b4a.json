            "text": ", Keywords-screening; Ebola; emerging infectious disease; adherence; travel screening; surveillance BACKGROUND United States emergency departments (EDs) are at the crossroads of medicine and public health. They are a vi-tal component and safety net of the health care system and a frequent access point for those with serious illness (1) . The ED has also become an important site for disease surveillance (2) . Epidemics such as plague, pandemic influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and human immunodeficiency virus have all demonstrated the catastrophic international spread of emerging infectious diseases (3) . With increasing globalization, epidemics are no longer isolated, but instead free to cross borders and oceans with alarming ease (4) . A substantial proportion of the care for travelers and immigrants is delivered in the ED (5) . Consequently, the ED shoulders an important burden of rapidly identifying and isolating patients with the potential to import epidemic emerging infectious diseases-as was the case during the 2014 outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in West Africa (6) . EVD is extremely low in prevalence in the United States, but the implications for failure to identify a case are exceedingly grave. For example, a case of missed EVD that was discharged from an ED in Dallas, Texas in September of 2014 made national news when it placed a community at risk and spread EVD to two health care workers (7) (8) (9) . Based on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations entitled ''Identify, Isolate, Inform'' during the fall of 2014, screening for at-risk travel and personal exposures should be performed on all patients presenting to the ED at the time of registration and triage (6) . As a result of the CDC recommendations, the University of Colorado Hospital and three affiliated community hospitals instituted a Universal Travel Screening (UTS) protocol to identify those patients at risk for importing EVD in the ED. The protocol mandates screening of all comers to the ED for 1) travel to affected countries in the previous 21 days and 2) contact with infected persons in the previous 21 days (Figure 1 ). Nursing or registration staff record responses to both travel screening questions at the time of triage, assisted by electronic medical record (EMR) reminders that prompt staff to complete the screening.",

In one multicenter study in New York City, mystery patients with simulated measles and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome who presented to the ED during unannounced drills were significantly less likely to be given a mask and then isolated when travel screening questions were not asked at triage (10) . Due to the low prevalence of EVD in the United States, it has not been possible to quantify the accuracy of screening. However, even a test with 100% sensitivity will fail the system if the test is not correctly applied to all comers. Unless the UTS protocol is applied to every patient, we may fail to identify individuals who import and transmit emerging infectious diseases such as EVD in our hospitals and communities. Our preliminary observations suggest that a number of patients each day do not have completed travel screening during triage despite the protocol and computerized reminders in the EMR.",

Dates were chosen to correspond with the height of the EVD outbreak and the maturation of a stable UTS protocol at our centers. No specific patient populations were excluded because UTS by definition applies to all comers. The four participating sites are located in three different cities and include an academic tertiary referral hospital and three community-level hospitals, with annual ED volumes ranging from 25,000 to over 110,000 encounters per year. Notably, the hospitals are staffed by three separate physician groups-one hosting a residency program-with different administrative structures.

This confirms previous observations that ED staff failed to screen ED patients for risks for importing EVD with some frequency. Based on this information, we recommend targeted revisions to the UTS protocol to enhance adherence for the inevitable future emerging pandemic threats. Regression analysis identified several statistically significant differences between the adherent and nonadherent groups. Many of these lacked large effect sizes but have plausible explanations. At the hospital level, factors such as increased ED daily census, hospital census, and boarder status are all proxies for the workload placed on ED staff. When the staff and resources are strained, it logically follows that human errors increase and adherence to UTS subsequently decreases.",

First, the gravity of missing a case of imported EVD puts many lives at risk. Second, the individual factors that we identified as most meaningfully associated with nonadherence could conceivably be more common in those patients most at risk for importing EVD. For example, a patient who contracts EVD in West Africa and then travels to the United States may not speak English and require ambulance transport to the hospital, where he or she may be triaged with an ESI level 1 or 2, depending on the severity of their presentation. This would imply that the patients most at risk for importing EVD are the ones that are least likely to be screened by the current protocol. Nonadherence may introduce a selection bias against high-risk groups in our ED population. Of course, there may be other factors outside of a travel screening program that may prompt nurses and clinicians to rapidly identify and isolate a case of imported EVD. For example, we noted that of the 8866 nonadherent encounters that had a documented triage temperature, only 1.3% (n = 112) had a fever > 38.0 C, whereas 1.8% (n = 2493) had a fever out of the 137,824 adherent encounters with a documented triage temperature. That said, a protocol serves to standardize the approach so that the system does not rely precariously on clinician gestalt.",
