ACE is crucial in the control of cardiovascular and renal homeostasis and fertility in mammals. In vertebrates, both transmembrane and soluble ACE, containing one or two active sites, have been characterized. So far, only soluble, single domain ACEs from invertebrates have been cloned, and these have been implicated in reproduction in insects. Furthermore, an ACE-related carboxypeptidase was recently characterized in Leishmania, a unicellular eukaryote, suggesting the existence of ACE in more distant organisms.",

To gain more insight into the bacterial enzymes, we cloned the putative ACE from the phytopathogenic bacterium, Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri, named XcACE. The 2 kb open reading frame encodes a 672-amino-acid soluble protein containing a single active site. In vitro expression and biochemical characterization revealed that XcACE is a functional 72 kDa dipeptidyl-carboxypeptidase. As in mammals, this metalloprotease hydrolyses angiotensin I into angiotensin II. XcACE is sensitive to ACE inhibitors and chloride ions concentration. Variations in the active site residues, highlighted by structural modelling, can account for the different substrate selectivity and inhibition profile compared to human ACE. XcACE characterization demonstrates that ACE is an ancestral enzyme, provoking questions about its appearance and structure/activity specialisation during the course of evolution.",

            "text": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, dipeptidyl-peptidase A, kininase II, E.C. 3.4.15.1, DCP1) is a dipeptidyl-carboxypeptidase that belongs to the M2-metalloprotease family. In mammals, this zinc-dependent metalloprotease participates in blood pressure elevation (review in (Corvol and Eyries, 2004) ), generating the vasopressor angiotensin II (Ang II) from the inactive angiotensin I (Ang I), and by inactivating the vasodilator bradykinin. In vertebrates, somatic (sACE) and testicular (germinal) ACE (tACE) have been characterized. These two separate isoforms are transcribed from two alternate promoters within a single gene (Howard et al., 1990) , which arose from duplication of an ancestral gene (Hubert et al., 1991) . Consequently, sACE possesses two domains (termed N-domain and C-domain, respectively) bearing the highly conserved gluzincin motif HExxH, whereas tACE possesses only one, corresponding to the C-terminal domain of sACE. Crystal structures of both the human N-domain (Corradi et al., 2006) and tACE (Natesh et al., 2003) have shown them to be homologous helical ellipsoids harbouring two large cavities connected by a narrow catalytic channel containing the catalytic zinc and the HexxH motif. Somatic ACE N-and C-domain active sites have distinct enzymatic specificities with respect to in vivo and/or synthetic substrates. Indeed, the C-domain is highly selective for Hippuryl-Histidyl-Leucine (HHL) (Wei et al., 1991a) whereas the N-domain efficiently cleaves the hemoregulatory peptide Ac-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro (AcSDKP) (Rousseau et al., 1995) and Ang 1-7 (Deddish et al., 1998) . In addition, ACE inhibitors (Dive et al., 1999) and chloride ion dependence (Jaspard et al., 1993) can discriminate between the two domains. Both sACE and tACE possess a C-terminal transmembrane domain and are membrane-anchored isoforms, though a post-translational shedding releases active solubilized ACE into the extracellular milieu (Eyries et al., 2001; Oppong and Hooper, 1993) . A single domain ACE homologue, ACE2, has also been characterized in the human (Donoghue et al., 2000; Tipnis et al., 2000) and its structure determined (Towler et al., 2004) . ACE2 is an essential regulator of heart function (Crackower et al., 2002) and has also been identified as a functional receptor for the SARS coronavirus (Li et al., 2003) .",

            "text": "In invertebrates, however, functional ACE-related enzymes exist in insects and in annelids (which belong to the Ecdysozoa and Lophotrochozoa groups, respectively). Interestingly, and though in silico evidence suggest the presence of a two-domain ACE-related protein in mosquitoes (Burnham et al., 2005) , all the cloned genes encode soluble, single active site enzymes (Tatei et al., 1995; Taylor et al., 1996; Wijffels et al., 1996) . In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, two homologues have been cloned and named AnCE (Cornell et al., 1995) and ACER (Tatei et al. 1995) (or Race) , of which AnCE has had its structure determined (Kim et al., 2003) . AnCE and ACER show about 40% amino-acid sequence identities with vertebrate ACEs, share similar enzymatic properties (Coates et al., 2000) , acting on a broad range of substrates and play a key role in development (Crackower et al., 2002) and reproduction (Ekbote et al., 1999; Hurst et al.., 2003) . Molecular and biochemical data from the leech ACE homologue have related it to the N-domain of mammalian ACE (Riviere et al., 2004) . However, no functional ACE is present in the genome of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), despite ACN-1, a homologue that lacks ACE-like proteolytic activity, is crucial in development (Brooks et al., 2003) . Recently, a dicarboxypeptidase, LdDCP, was cloned in a pathogenic unicellular eukaryote, Leishmania donovani (Goyal et al., 2005) . LdDCP, like ACE, is able to cleave a carboxyterminal dipeptide from HHL and is inhibited by captopril, suggesting that ACE may have already been present before the appearance of multicellular organisms. However, LdDCP was not reported to hydrolyse AngI and does not display sequence homology with ACE enzymes. These observations raise questions about the presence of a true ACE in more distant species.",

All these sequences display a great similarity despite phylogenetic distance (for references see http://tolweb.org and (DeLong and Pace, 2001)). The striking sequence conservation in the active region of these putative ACE-like peptidases suggests that the protease activity would be conserved in these ancestral, prokaryotic species. Among them, Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri (X. citri) is a phytopathogen gamma-proteobacteria in whose genome an ACE-like encoding sequence has been annotated. In order to gain more insight into stages in ACE evolution and to investigate its putative activity in unicellular organisms, we report the cloning and biochemical characterization of the expressed recombinant enzyme. We have also generated a homology-based model of XcACE using the structure of tACE to understand the interactions of residues in the active site. This ACE-like enzyme in X. citri is, to our knowledge, the first bacterial ACE-like enzyme ever characterized.",

The transcription of the XcACE gene was suggested by the sequence conservation upstream the start codon and is assessed by the presence of a specific 437-bp RT-PCR product in DNAse-treated, reverse-transcribed total RNA (Fig. 2) . The protein encoded by this gene, referred to as XcACE (Xanthomonas citri angiotensin-converting enzyme), is a 672 amino-acid protein. Hydrophobicity profile (SignalP V1.1 at www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP) indicates cleavage of a putative signal peptide between residues 26 and 27 of the native protein (\u2026RDA\u2195AP\u2026). There does not appear to be a motif encoding a transmembrane domain at the C-terminus or elsewhere in the mature molecule, suggesting that XcACE should exist only in a soluble form. Because of the mutation inserted, the recombinant proenzyme is slightly different from the native one in the N-terminal end (rXcACE: MQGPPVNPRLL vs nXcACE: MNPRLL). However, this difference does not change predictions about the signal peptide (hydrophobicity profile and cleavage site) (data not shown), indicating that the mature recombinant and native proteins have identical primary sequences. The mature enzyme has a theoretical molecular weight of 72 kDa and an isoelectric point of 5.72. Its primary structure includes all the residues implied in zinc (H 429 (Natesh et al., 2004) binding. Thus the soluble, secreted enzyme should possess a single active site like the other ACEs found in invertebrates. Whereas two chloride atoms were observed bound to the human tACE, XcACE appears to be more similar to the N-domain in this respect, as it only has the chloride II binding site conserved (Y 230 and R 567 ), and only one amino acid among the three implicated in the binding of the first chloride atom (W 530 ). The XcACE primary sequence has between 31 and 37% identity with the other known ACEs (human, Drosophila and leech) and 26% with C. elegans ACN-1 ( Fig. 1 and Supplementary data).",

Despite the fact that the recombinant enzyme was expressed in a heterologous system, both native and recombinant forms display almost identical features, indicating a satisfactory purity of XcACE and strongly suggesting that the ACE in X. citri is a functional ACE enzyme in vivo. XcACE, like Drosophila AnCE (data not shown), is active in the absence of chloride ions and less sensitive to variations in chloride ion concentration than human C-domain ACE (Houard et al., 1998) . This characteristic is likely to be due to the absence in the primary sequence of XcACE, as in AnCE, of two key amino acids observed to bind ClI in human tACE (XcACE : R186H and R489K; AnCE : R1867Yand W485F, when compared to tACE). XcACE hydrolyses a broad range of substrates, including human N-and C-domain ACE specific substrates (AcSDAcKP and HHL, respectively). In addition to this dicarboxypeptidase activity, XcACE also acts as an endopeptidase, hydrolysing the C-terminal blocked amidated substrate [Leu5]-enkephalinamide. Western blot results using polyclonal antibody raised against the full-length human sACE protein show a unique band corresponding to XcACE, indicating that XcACE shares common epitopic features with the human enzyme. Molecular modelling allowed us to visualise the structural differences in the catalytic site. Key active site residues such as the zinc-binding motif, His 513 and Tyr 526 (tACE numbering) are conserved in XcACE and many other ACE-like enzymes. However, in line with the assay results, the non-conserved active site residues are neither identical to the C-or N-domain of human ACE, and are the presumed cause of the different substrate selectivity and inhibition profile of XcACE. Comparison of the XcACE model with either the human tACE or N-domain shows that lisinopril fits in the XcACE active site and retains most of the same binding interactions. The exception is in the lysyl pocket, which has features in common with AnCE or the human N-domain including a positively charged residue, lysine (equivalent to Arg 356 in AnCE and Arg 350 in the human N-domain) that appears to affect the overall charge of the pocket (Fig. 5) . Indeed, similar to XcACE, neither AnCE nor the N-domain have as high affinity for lisinopril as tACE (Michaud et al., 1997; Williams et al., 1996) . Furthermore, the difference in affinity of XcACE and tACE for inhibitors with hydrophobic P1 groups (i.e. lisinopril, delaprilat and perindoprilat) could be attributed to the difference in hydrophobicity of the S1 subsite. XcACE has a threonine and tyrosine in contrast to Phe 512 and Val 518 in tACE (Fig. 5) . The N-terminal aspartate, N-acetyl groups and the Cterminal amide of RXP407 are the reported determinants required for its remarkable N-domain specificity (Dive et al., 1999) . Of the four possible residues suggested for N-domain selective recognition of RXP 407 (Corradi et al., 2006; Tzakos and Gerothanassis, 2005) , XcACE only retains the threonine (T 496 in the N-domain) and has a lysine which replaces Arg 500 of the N-domain. This, combined with the hydrophobic P1 group, may be the reason that RXP407 is not a strong inhibitor for XcACE. The affinity of XcACE for fosinoprilat is harder to rationalise as it has been modelled in different conformations for the N-and C-domains of human ACE (Tzakos and Gerothanassis, 2005) . However, XcACE retains all the residues suggested to be involved in inhibitor binding with both domains of human ACE.",

XcACE is soluble and its sequence exhibits a signal peptide indicating, along with the absence of ACE activity in the culture medium, that XcACE is a secreted enzyme which is trapped into the periplasmic space. The constitutive expression could indicate an important function for ACE in X. citri, as a possible role for the enzyme in peptidoglycan remodelling, a critical parameter in environmental adaptation. This is in line with the characterization in the periplasm of other gram negative bacteria of VanX Dalanyl-D-alanine dipeptidase, a regulated carboxypeptidase that is responsible for Vancomycin resistance (Lessard and Walsh, 1999) . XcACE could also participate in X.citri pathogenicity within the cocktail of degradative enzymes required during plant infection. Interestingly, in this regard, ACE inhibitors are found in hydrolysates of plants sensitive to the \"black rot\" caused by Xanthomonas, including rice and soybean (He et al., 2005; Wu and Ding, 2001) . The large number of substrates of XcACE does not exclude a possible function of protein degradation that might generate dipeptides for protein biosynthesis. To this extent, it is interesting to note that ACE is highly expressed in the digestive tract of all metazoan species presenting an active ACE.",

Its presence in eukarya as well as in bacteria indicates that the enzyme could have appeared before the divergence between these two groups. This strongly suggests that XcACE is the most ancestral present-day representative of ACE characterized to date. However, as all completely sequenced genomes of plants, algaes and mycetes lack ACE, caution should be exercised with this hypothesis. The presence of an ACE-like enzyme in bacteria could also be the result of a horizontal gene transfer from eucaryotic to bacterial species. However, conservation in sequences surrounding the ACE gene, suggestive of mobile genetic elements, is not observed within 30 kb of the gene in seven distinct bacterial strains (data not shown). Furthermore, the parasitic bacterial species with an ACE-like gene are all hosted by organisms lacking the enzyme. In addition, not all bacterial species with a putative ACE gene are parasitic. Thus, the presence of ACE in bacteria, like the situation encountered in annelids, is unlikely to be related to parasitism, suggesting that bacterial ACE, represented herein by XcACE, corresponds to the ancestral, original enzyme.",

In contrast, lisinopril, a C-domain-related inhibitor, is less efficient than captopril, related to the N-domain, though most of the residues for binding of both are conserved. Thus, from the biochemical and the structural properties of XcACE it is not possible to ascribe this bacterial enzyme to either the mammalian N-or C-domain of human ACE. The primitive ACE would then not be closer to either domain of the mammalian enzyme, in contrast to what was previously suggested (Coates et al., 2000; Hubert et al., 1991; Lattion et al., 1989) .",

Taken together, our results bring the evidence of the presence of a functional ACE in prokaryotes, in contrast to the previous hypothesis about the latter appearance of ACE during phylogeny. It also appears that sequence/structure conservation of ACE enabled preservation of dipeptidase activity during evolutionary specialisation. XcACE is the most ancestral ACE present-day representative and has features in common to both the N-and the C-domain of mammalian somatic ACE. It is possible that this ancestral ACE was a poorly specialised protease which has acquired its present specialisation over a long evolutionary period. However, the biological function(s) as well as the endogenous substrates and/or inhibitors of bacterial ACE remain to be characterized. To clarify these issues, the use of ACE inhibitors in vivo and the generation of a mutant bacterial strain lacking ACE may be helpful. Some of these functions of ACE might also be conserved in humans, and their characterization could lead to a better understanding of the evolution of this crucial enzyme.",
