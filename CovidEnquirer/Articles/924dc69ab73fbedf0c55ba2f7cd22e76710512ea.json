Either way, the impact of coinfections, in general, is still unclear. [8] [9] [10] Recent studies examining the etiology of bronchiolitis in infants have reported high rates of viral detection. [10] [11] [12] However, these studies have been limited to hospitaladmitted patients, which may lead them to over-or underestimate the true significance of the roles that different viral etiologies may play in determining the severity of bronchiolitis.",

This hypothesis is supported by Miron et al., 10 who used the same method for rhinovirus detection 21 and reported a coinfection rate of nearly 30%. 10 Another advantage of the RT-PCR approach employed in this study is its ability to identify the recently described genotype of human rhinovirus, namely rhinovirus C, which has been associated with a greater clinical impact. 22, 23 RSV was the most common virus found in single-virus infections, whereas rhinovirus, the second most frequently identified virus, was mainly found in coinfections; these results are in agreement with previous findings. 10, 12 Due to the large number of coinfections and the small number of children in each viral category of our study, a comprehensive analysis of the impact of each virus identified in coinfections was not feasible. However, we observed that the detection of RSV in either a single-virus infection or a coinfection did not differ between hospital and ICU admissions. Richard et al. 9 reported an increased risk of admission to the ICU when a dual viral infection was found, but the population in their study included many premature infants and children with underlying chronic illnesses. Marguet et al. 12 did not find a difference in bronchiolitis severity in patients infected with single-virus RSV infections compared to those with RSV-rhinovirus coinfections. The only differences identified were a reduction in the length of stay when an associated rhinovirus infection was present and that patients with a single-virus rhinovirus infection had milder presentations. 12 Interestingly, the identification of enterovirus, but not RSV, showed a significant association with hospital admissions in the multivariate model even though an enterovirus single-virus infection was found in only one patient. Jacques et al. 24 reported a high rate of hospitalization among infants infected with enterovirus with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis, but this finding may be biased by an etiological criterion in the inclusion criteria for the study.",
