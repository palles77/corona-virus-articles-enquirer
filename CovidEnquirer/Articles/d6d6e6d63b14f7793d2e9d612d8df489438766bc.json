We administered a 14-question survey via structured interviews to individuals occupying activated HEICS leadership positions at NCKUH to identify the organization, structure, and function of the HEICS units and subunits they led and the job actions they performed from 25 March to 16 June 2003 Thirty-three of 38 persons (87%) occupying 39 of 44 (89%) activated HEICS leadership positions directly participated in the survey. The participants collectively reported: 1) the creation of four new HEICS unit leader positions and corresponding units during the outbreak, including the infection control officer (administrative section) and SARS assessment, isolation, and critical care unit leaders (operations section); 2) the creation of six new HEICS subunits, including functional areas for fever screening, SARS assessment, and resuscitation outside the hospital, and SARS patient care, SARS critical care, and employee isolation inside the hospital; and 3) the performance of new job actions related to infection control by all HEICS unit leaders. HEICS provides a flexible framework that seems to have assisted NCKUH in the organization of its emergency response to the SARS outbreak in Taiwan, ROC. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier Inc.",

First, HEICS provided a flexible organizational structure that facilitated the creation of new units and subunits and new functions of hospital emergency response as the evolving crisis demanded. This organizational flexibility was imperative because a rapidly evolving infectious disease emergency involving a highly contagious agent had never been encountered before. A major critical adaptation at NCKUH was the establishment of the infection control officer within the HEICS administrative section. Because infection control plays a key role in contagious infectious disease emergencies, it is paramount that the infection control officer has an overall perspective of the entire hospital, a close advisory relationship with the incident commander, and direct communication links with other HEICS managers and section chiefs. The importance of infection control in the emergency response to SARS cannot be overstated, Enforced closure of all hospital entrances/exits except outpatient and ED entrances Enforced traffic control in fever screening subunit and triage unit, and perimeter control in SARS assessment, isolation and critical care units Supervised demarcation of designated traffic routes into, out of, and within hospital, and off-limits areas with yellow tape barriers Enforced restriction of vendor deliveries to 5:00 a.m. at hospital basement entrance * Regional SARS Emergency Network was comprised of the Tainan city health bureau and five hospitals in the city. ** Appointed deputy safety and security officer to participate in survey.

Another critical adaptation was the establishment of a new SARS assessment unit leader and corresponding unit in temporary shelters outside the ED. This unit not only provided several new SARS-related functions in its three subunits, but its outdoor configuration enabled the expansion of ED isolation surge capacity without having to modify the existing ED structure or reduce patient care capacity in the already overcrowded ED. Another key adaptation was the creation of a new fever-screening subunit to screen for fever all persons entering the outpatient entrance of the hospital and the expansion of the triage unit's function to screen for fever all persons entering the ED entrance of the hospital. Because these services were based in temporary areas out-side the hospital, no changes were required in the hospital structure. Paralleling these efforts outside the hospital were the creation of the SARS isolation and critical care units inside the hospital for the management of patients with suspected and probable SARS and the isolation of febrile employees. The creation of these units within functionally overlapping areas enabled the production of in-hospital isolation surge capacity without a major disruption of patient care services. Second, HEICS provided a predictable modular framework that helped NCKUH to logically determine where these new units and subunits were to be placed within the overall organization, enabling their rapid assimilation into the greater whole.",

Although these inactivated units may have been helpful during an earthquake or typhoon, they were unnecessary during the SARS outbreak, which did not cause structural damage to the hospital, generate large numbers of victims, produce victims with minor injuries, produce injuries that could be managed in a delayed manner, or displace dependents of hospital personnel. Fourth, HEICS provided a hierarchical command and control structure that helped infection control policy at NCKUH rapidly evolve as the situation unfolded. Almost daily during the outbreak, the Taiwanese Center for Disease Control recommended new infection control policy to the infection control officer at NCKUH (2) . In other cases, the infection control officer communicated directly with hospitals in Taipei, Hong Kong, and Singapore or accessed the Internet to learn from other's experience with SARS (19) . The infection control officer then used this information to make frequent policy recommendations for infection control at NCKUH to the EOC. The EOC considered these recommendations at their daily meetings and the incident commander made any final policy decisions. New or updated infection control policy was then promptly disseminated to relevant HEICS sections and units through the hospital intranet.",

During the SARS outbreak at NCKUH, every HEICS position was reported as having new job actions related to infection control (Tables 2-5) . At a minimum, every HEICS unit leader had the responsibility to educate the unit members about infection control measures, ensure the use of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE), and monitor the unit personnel for fever (body temperature was checked twice per 8-h shift). Overall, many new job actions related to infection control were required, including activities related to patient isolation, traffic and perimeter control, decontamination, handwashing, and fever screening. Finally, HEICS provided a convenient mechanism for capturing key hospital emergency response activities ac- cording to the job actions of each HEICS position. Knowledge of job actions at NCKUH during the SARS outbreak may assist other hospitals seeking to use HEICS (Tables 2-5 ). In addition, this SARS outbreak demonstrated many of the features suggestive of a bioterrorist attack, including the aerosol spread of infection, predominate pulmonary pattern of disease, multiple patients with similar signs and symptoms, simultaneous presentation, multiple simultaneous outbreaks, and lack of an identified natural vector. Accordingly, an understanding of the implementation of HEICS at NCKUH may help emergency preparedness not only for future outbreaks of SARS, but also for intentional releases of contagious biological agents in susceptible populations (e.g., smallpox, pneumonic plague). This study is also subject to several limitations. Our selection of potential survey participants as occupants of HEICS leadership positions may have led to omissions of information about critical actions performed by nonmanagement personnel. Our structured interview methodology may have encouraged some participants to selfreport more favorable versions of actions than were actually performed (recall bias). Our analysis of the descriptive data may be biased, because three of the authors also participated in the NCKUH emergency response. Our inability to directly survey five persons occupying HEICS leadership positions may have led to an incomplete description of the structure and function of HEICS during the outbreak. Moreover, we did not evaluate the perceived adequacy or success of HEICS by the participants at NCKUH. Finally, we did not evaluate the effectiveness of HEICS at NCKUH during the outbreak or compare HEICS with other systems of hospital emergency management. On one hand, only 38 patients were hospitalized with suspected or probable SARS during the outbreak at NCKUH, three of whom died, suggesting a low burden of disease. On the other hand, no cases of nosocomial transmission occurred at NCKUH, suggesting that the disease was successfully contained.",

We administered a 14-question survey via structured interviews to individuals occupying activated HEICS leadership positions at NCKUH to identify the organization, structure, and function of the HEICS units and subunits they led and the job actions they performed from 25 March to 16 June 2003 Thirty-three of 38 persons (87%) occupying 39 of 44 (89%) activated HEICS leadership positions directly participated in the survey. The participants collectively reported: 1) the creation of four new HEICS unit leader positions and corresponding units during the outbreak, including the infection control officer (administrative section) and SARS assessment, isolation, and critical care unit leaders (operations section); 2) the creation of six new HEICS subunits, including functional areas for fever screening, SARS assessment, and resuscitation outside the hospital, and SARS patient care, SARS critical care, and employee isolation inside the hospital; and 3) the performance of new job actions related to infection control by all HEICS unit leaders. HEICS provides a flexible framework that seems to have assisted NCKUH in the organization of its emergency response to the SARS outbreak in Taiwan, ROC. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier Inc.",
