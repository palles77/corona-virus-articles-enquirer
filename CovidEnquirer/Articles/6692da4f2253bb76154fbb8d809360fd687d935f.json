Various extraction techniques (free fraction, acid hydrolyses and enzyme hydrolyses) and their comparison were carried out for investigation of the metabolism of anisodamine. After extraction procedure the pretreated samples were injected on a reversed-phase C18 column with mobile phase (0.2 ml/min) of methanol/0.01% triethylamine solution (adjusted to pH 3.5 with formic acid) (60:40, v/v) and detected by MS/MS. Identification and structural elucidation of the metabolites were performed by comparing their changes in molecular masses ( M), retention-times and full scan MS n spectra with those of the parent drug. At least 11 metabolites (N-demethyl-6\u2424-hydroxytropine, 6\u2424-hydroxytropine, tropic acid, N-demethylanisodamine, hydroxyanisodamine, anisodamine N-oxide, hydroxyanisodamine N-oxide, glucuronide conjugated N-demethylanisodamine, sulfate conjugated and glucuronide conjugated anisodamine, sulfate conjugated hydroxyanisodamine) and the parent drug were found in rat urine after the administration of a single oral dose 25 mg/kg of anisodamine. Hydroxyanisodamine, anisodamine N-oxide and the parent drug were detected in rat urine for up 95 h after ingestion of anisodamine.",

Therefore, fast and efficient ways to provide accurate information of drug metabolism on the target compounds and their major metabolites are required [1] [2] [3] . In the past, GC with electron capture detection or nitrogen phosphorus detection and HPLC with ultraviolet (UV) spectrophotometric detection, fluorescence detection or electrochemical detection (ECD) were the main methods to detect drugs and their major metabolites in vivo. But these technologies cannot provide high enough sensitivity, specificity and molecular structural information for the qualitative assay of drugs and their metabolites. The coupled GC-MS technology can overcome these insufficiencies, but it often requires time consuming derivatization of the target compound [4, 5] . So, this method is not suitable for the detection of drug metabolites, too.",

LC-MS system allows for the analyses of thermolabile, highly polar and non-volatile metabolites owing to its soft-ionization technique and high sensitivity, and the target compounds can be directly determined in mixtures without complicated sample preparation or derivatization. Compared with LC-MS, LC-MS/MS can give us the maximum amount of structural information and high specificity for qualitative analysis at trace levels. It has been proved to be a powerful approach for the metabolic identification of drugs [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . So, LC-MS/MS technique is frequently the initial choice for metabolite detection and identification. Structural elucidation of drug metabolites using LC-MS/MS is based on the premise that metabolites retain the substructures of the parent drug molecule. MS/MS product ion spectrum of each metabolite provides detailed substructural information of its structure. So, using the product ion spectrum of parent drug as a substructural template, metabolites presented in crude mixtures may be rapidly identified and detected based on their changes in molecular masses ( M) and spectral patterns of product ions even without standards for each metabolite [14] [15] [16] .",

It has widespread activities such as spasmolytic, anaesthetic, acesodyne and ophthalmic effects, and it is often used to treat transmissible shock, hepatitis, nephritis, sugar diabetes and so on [17] [18] [19] . In China, anisodamine was tentatively used to treat patients for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. Despite its important therapeutical values, its metabolism in vivo is not clear yet. Up till now, the works only focused on the quantitative determination of anisodamine in rabbit and human serum by means of thin layer chromatography [20] , micellar liquid chromatography [21] and reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography [22, 23] .",

Besides, there was the molecular ion at m/z 466 in the negative ion full scan LC-MS spectrum of the urine samples, which gave the daughter ion at m/z 175 in its MS 2 spectrum. Furthermore, the m/z 113 ion appeared in the MS 3 spectrum of m/z 466 \u2192 175. This fragmentation (m/z 466 \u2192 175 \u2192 113) is the cleavage feature of glucuronide conjugates [30, 31] . Based on the above discussion, the proposed major metabolic pathway of anisodamine in rats was shown in These metabolites can be investigated further by comparing various extraction procedures (Table 1) . Compared with free fraction, the peak areas of LC-MS 2 chromatograms of M3, M0 and M4 increased markedly, and those of M7-M10 decreased after acidic hydrolyses. The peak areas of M3 and M0 increased, and those of M9 and M10 decreased after enzymatic hydrolysis. These results revealed that Ndemethylanisodamine (M3), the unchanged anisodamine (M0) and hydroxyanisodamine (M4) excreted from rat urine as the free, sulfate conjugated or glucuronide conjugated forms.",

Their LC-MS 2 chromatograms were presented in Fig. 3. The MS/MS product ion spectra of these analytes were shown in Fig. 4. Among them, the retention time, the MS and MS/MS spectra of the molecular ion at m/z 306 (M0, Figs. 3D and 4D) were the same as those of anisodamine standard. Therefore, M0 can be confirmed as the unchanged parent drug. The characteristic product ions at m/z 140 and 122 of the parent drug appeared in the MS 2 spectrum of m/z 158 (M2, Fig. 4B).
