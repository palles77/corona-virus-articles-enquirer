In response to the risk of hospital transmissions to healthcare workers and other patients, maximum precautions in isolation wards aim to limit transmission.",

He lived in the United Arab Emirates and had returned to France for a holiday 5 days before admission. Fever had appeared 3 days earlier. He was initiated on amoxicillin by a general practitioner 2 days before. He was admitted to the emergency department for a persistent fever at 39.5 C with cough, shortness of breath and general weakness. His main medical and surgical history included an aortic prosthesis (Bentall surgery) with a mechanical aortic prosthesis, and a pacemaker implanted in 2002. The neutrophil count was 23 230/mm 3 , thrombocytes were low (97 000/mm 3 ) and the C-reactive protein was elevated (386 mg/L). Chest X-ray was normal. The first hypothesis raised by the emergency department doctor was an infective endocarditis on the mechanical prosthesis. But the geographic provenance, the presence of fever and cough led to classification as a possible MERS-CoV, after case review with The 'Institut national de Veille sanitaire', according to the national recommendation. The patient was placed in the isolation ward 8 hours after admission (H8) through the emergency department.",

Only automatized tests could be collected and analysed. Other microbiological tests, such as blood cultures, should not be sent to the laboratory until MERS-Cov PCR of a superficial or deep airway sample has returned negative [5]. Twelve hours after admission (H12), based on the infectious disease clinical assessment, MERS-CoV diagnosis was no longer considered. Isolation procedures were stopped in the emergency department with the agreement of the 'Institut national de Veille sanitaire' and three blood culture sets were sampled. Cloxacillin and gentamicin were initiated targeting an infective endocarditis. Eight hours later (H20), blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus with negative mecA geneXpert. Trans-thoracic and transoesophageal echocardiographs revealed a mobile echogenic mass of 10 mm on the cardiac valve, along with a thickened posterior ring. Screening for septic embolism showed a cerebral ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke and fungal aneurysm on the left femoral artery. Surgical intervention was performed on day 10 of antibiotic initiation. Surgery was followed with diaphragmatic rupture in the pericardia, and retroperitoneal bleeding. After 17 days in the intensive care unit the patient died.",

There has been no new MERS-CoV infection in France since 2012 and these restrictions are more stringent than the WHO guidelines.
