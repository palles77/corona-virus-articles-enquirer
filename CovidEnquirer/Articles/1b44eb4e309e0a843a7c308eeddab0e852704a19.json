To provide scientific basis for promoting the physical and psychological health of these staff members. Method: The 102 medical staff workers who were exposed to H7N9 patients were recruited through convenient sampling between January 2015 and May 2016. We used a self-reported questionnaire, the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C), to evaluate the PTSD symptoms among doctors and nurses from an intensive care unit (n \u00bc 61), a respiratory department (n \u00bc 20), and an emergency department (n \u00bc 21). We then analyzed the related factors. Results: Around 20.59% of the tested doctors and nurses showed PTSD symptoms. The sample had a mean PCL-C score of 30.00 \u00b1 9.95. The differences in the scores of doctors and nurses with different genders, ages, professional titles, contact frequencies, trainings, and experiences were statistically significant (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Moreover, t-tests and one-way analysis of variance showed that nurses received higher scores than doctors, female participants received higher scores than male participants, and the participants with low professional title and high contact frequency, aged between 20 years and 30 years, with less than five years of work experience, having not received related training and with no related experience obtained higher PCL-C scores than the others (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Conclusion: The PTSD level of doctors and nurses after their exposure to H7N9 patients was high, which warrant further research. Health and medical institutions should pay attention to the physical and psychological health of these staff members.",

A total of 131 laboratory-confirmed cases of H7N9 infection had been documented as of May 21, 2013, among which 36 resulted in death [2] . The number of fatalities related to the virus continues to increase. Most H7N9 patients showed signs of rapidly progressing lower respiratory tract infection, severe acute respiratory distress, septic shock, and multi-organ failure [3] , while only a few manifested moderate illnesses [4] . The H7N9 outbreak not only raised public health concerns but also caused tremendous psychological distress, particularly among doctors and nurses who were exposed to H7N9 patients because these practitioners are among the most vulnerable population during a global event.",

            "text": "Exposure to trauma has been associated with psychological distress and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [5] . PTSD is a state of psychological unbalance following an exposure to traumatic events; people with PTSD often re-experience traumatic events, demonstrate avoidance behavior, and become irritable [6] . PTSD is a severe anxiety disorder that can result in serious disability across several domains of functioning [7] . PTSD symptoms have also been associated with poor quality of life [8] . Kessler [9] found a 7.8% lifetime prevalence of PTSD among the general population and a higher prevalence among the high-risk population. Medical staff members usually work in the front lines at times of epidemics and natural disasters, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, earthquakes, and other fatal epidemics. Harsh environments, depressing settings, and workload pressure can even threaten the lives and impose psychological trauma on these workers and increase their sensitivity to PTSD. Ping Wu [10] evaluated the mental health of medical staff members who were involved in the SARS outbreak and found that about 10% of the respondents had experienced high levels of PTSD symptoms since the outbreak. Meanwhile, those respondents who had been isolated, worked in high-risk workplaces such as SARS wards, or had friends or close relatives who contacted SARS were two to three times more likely to develop high levels of PTSD symptoms than those who were not exposed to the virus. In conclusion, Ping Wu suggested further examinations and interventions on the mental health of medical staff members involved in the SARS outbreak.",

One study reported that probable PTSD cases were significantly more prevalent among older people and residents of SARS-affected regions, thereby indicating that age and degree of exposure could be treated as significant predictors of PTSD [11] . Another study reported the prevalence of PTSD, and they found that female gender, having H1N1 influenza, having family members, friends, or acquaintances with H1N1 virus, and feared of contracting the H1N1 virus were significant predictors of PTSD [12] . However, only few studies have investigated PTSD among doctors and nurses who have been exposed to H7N9 patients.

Afterward, the participants were asked to complete a self-reported questionnaire, the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C), which was developed by an American PTSD research center following the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV [13] . This scale includes 17 items for evaluating three clusters of PTSD symptoms, including intrusive symptoms (Criterion B l-5 title), avoidance symptoms (Criterion C 6e12 title), and hyper-arousal symptoms (Criterion D 13e17 title). The study supported the value of the PCL-C as a screening instrument for PTSD. The reliability and validity of this instrument had been proven in previous research [13, 14] . The total PCL, intrusive, avoidance, and hyperarousal scores had Cronbach's alpha coefficients of 0.94, 0.85, 0.85, and 0.87, respectively, thereby indicating high internal consistency. The test retake correlation coefficients for the total PCL scores were 0.92 (P < 0.001) for immediate re-takers and 0.88 (P < 0.001) for participants with one-week retest intervals. The frequency of stress symptoms occurrence during the past four weeks was rated on a five-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). The total score ranged between 17 and 85, with a higher score indicating a higher chance for these patients to show PTSD symptoms. A previous study [15] suggested that the prevalence of PTSD symptoms could only be ascertained if the PCL-C scores were equal or greater than 38.",

The male and female participants also showed statistically significant differences in their PCL-C scores. The participants aged between 20 years and 30 years received the highest PCL-C scores, and statistically significant differences were observed between the avoidance syndrome and total PCL-C scores of participants aged 31 yearse40 years and those aged >40 years. Those participants with low professional titles and high contact frequency obtained higher PCL-C scores than the others. Those participants who received related training received lower intrusive syndrome, avoidance syndrome, and total PCL-C scores and higher hyper-arousal syndrome scores than those who did not receive such training. Those staff members with less than five years of work experience received higher scores in all dimensions than those who were working for more than five years (Table 3) .",

The increasing number of new H7N9 cases and the high mortality rate among H7N9 patients have attracted public attention, and other countries are becoming concerned about the further spread of the virus outside of China. The hospital environment has a high risk of spreading infectious diseases, particularly the pandemic influenza H7N9. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report the stress symptoms among doctors and nurses during the H7N9 influenza epidemic. Most of these practitioners experienced various stress reactions, and 20.59% eventually developed PTSD. Those doctors and nurses who were exposed to H7N9 patients were prone to developing severe anxiety and stress symptoms. Therefore, examining the PTSD symptoms of these medical workers must be prioritized. Exposure to traumatic events is the immediate cause of PTSD and is essential in diagnosing such disorder. Poton [16] found that medical workers usually manifest the symptoms of their patients after experiencing a traumatic event, but such symptoms were always ignored. Alexander [17] suggested that those people who were repeatedly exposed to traumatic events were prone to suffering all kinds of psychological problems.",

First, nurses come in contact with their patients more frequently than doctors while performing their basic nursing and life care tasks. Second, many nurses have limited knowledge on H7N9. Third, nurses feel nervous, panicky, and helpless when facing epidemics. Moreover, as reported in the literature, females are 2.38e2.49 times more likely to develop lifetime PTSD than males after their exposure to similar traumatic events [18] . Accordingly, the female respondents in this study showed higher PTSD levels than the male respondents.",

This result is in line with the fact that stress symptoms are related to the degree of exposure to a stressful event [20] . However, Declercq found no relationship between the frequency of encountering critical incidents and the occurrence of PTSD symptoms [21] . Jiahong [12] found that knowledge on H1N1 and exposure to H1N1 patients could not predict stress symptoms. However, those medical staff members with different education backgrounds and were working in different departments showed no differences in their PTSD levels. This study has several potential limitations. First, the measures of stress symptoms used in this study may be vulnerable to inherent bias because of their self-reported nature. However, the PCL-C is a validated measure of stress symptoms [22] . Second, the participants were recruited through convenient sampling, thereby introducing some bias in the sample and reducing the generalizability of the results. Third, this study adopted a limited sample, that is, we only focused on those medical staff members who were exposed to H7N9 patients in some cities of Anhui Province between January 2015 and May 2016. Future studies must adopt a larger sample, perform multicenter randomized controlled trials, and use objective and quantitative measurements to evaluate PTSD levels.",

This study analyzed the incidence and risk factors of PTSD among medical workers after their exposure to H7N9 patients.
