We used country and state-level data from 2015 to mid-2017 to infer key model parameters, country-specific disease reporting rates, and the 2018 projected incidence. A 10-fold cross-validation approach was used to validate parameter estimates to out-of-sample epidemic trajectories.",

Model estimates of the timing of the peak in incidence were correlated (p<0.05) with the reported peak in incidence.

To date, there has been limited use of population-based surveys to determine the circulation and seroprevalence of ZIKV in LAC, owing to challenges in interpretation of serological tests that cross-react with other flaviviruses (e.g. dengue). 6, 7 In addition to the reduction in Zika cases there has also been a marked reduction in incidence of reported dengue and chikungunya cases in Brazil, meaning that the role of climatic, and other factors affecting mosquito density, or cross-immunity between arboviruses cannot be ruled out.",

Due to either data unavailability or inaccuracies in the reported number of Zika cases in each country at the time of analysis, such approaches have either not used incidence data at all, [15] [16] [17] fit models to data on other arboviruses 14 or used selected serological surveys or comparing model outputs to incidence data not used within model fitting. 13, [19] [20] [21] Considerably more data are now available across LAC and spanning multiple arboviral transmission seasons.

The timing of the peak in outbreaks has been previously shown to be a useful summary statistic for epidemic dynamics, 32, 33 and preliminary analysis illustrated that annual incidence had a good discriminatory power for the estimating parameters of the model.

Both the reported incidence of cases and modelling results from this study suggest that the transmission of ZIKV had continued until herd immunity was reached, despite major efforts to limit its spread through vector control. Whilst the reported and projected reduction in ZIKV cases is undoubtedly good news for affected communities, it is only because substantial numbers of individuals have already been infected. Therefore, it remains vital to maintain surveillance for congenital and developmental abnormalities and provide long-term care for affected people and families. 38 The aim of this analysis was to assess if cities in LAC were likely to experience ZIKV cases in 2018, to support resource planning and trials. Our modelling results suggest a very low incidence in 2018. This analysis supports the findings of previous mathematical models of ZIKV. 5, 11, 13, 14 In addition, our study provides estimates of incidence and risk for specific cities, estimates of case reporting rates, incorporates parameter uncertainty, includes out-of-sample validation of the model estimates and uses more data than other modelling studies as we incorporate ZIKV case reports alongside ecological data to determine city-specific epidemic trajectories and seasonality curves.",

However, while we predict the outbreak to largely be over in these large cities, smaller more remote cities and peri-urban areas may still have susceptible individuals and experience cases. Should additional sub-national data on the timing of the peak become available, the model fitting and projections can easily be updated. Case reporting rates indicate a lower rate within countries that report only confirmed cases, and the rates within Brazil, El Salvador, Martinique, Puerto Rico, and Suriname align well with other estimates measured using alternative methods. 21, 41, 42 Despite the short-comings in the available data, we present the most up-to-date and robust predictions of Zika incidence in 2018. As the projected incidence is consistently low across all model runs, this finding is quite robust to the variability accounted for in the model. Validation of these findings are necessary through multi-site population representative seroprevalence surveys across LAC to monitor seroconversion to ZIKV, such as in Netto et al.. 19 Reporting of cases within LAC has reduced markedly since the downgrading of ZIKV from a public health emergency of international concern to an ongoing public health challenge (in November 2018). 43 Consequently, it remains difficult to compare these projections to incidence data for 2018. This research has highlighted that within LAC the spread of ZIKV was better represented by a gravity model than flight movements. This may seem surprising as flight data are cited as a source of emerging infections, such as ZIKV. 44 But cars and public transportation are used for most journeys; and the movement of people impacts the spatial spread of vector-borne diseases. 38, 45 Perhaps for highly transmissible infectious diseases movements facilitated by flights are sufficient for predicting introduction of a pathogen in a new population, but this analysis suggests that triggering of a ZIKV outbreak may require more frequent exposure than air travel. The migration patterns assumed within each model are quite different in LAC (see Supporting Information), suggesting that models which have not tested the relative fit of each and use one alone could be prone to errors in estimated spread of ZIKV. In comparison to mobility modelling in North America, Europe and Africa, the mobility patterns in Latin America are not well quantified and require further study.",

            "text": "ZIKV has spread widely across LAC, affecting all cities during 2015-2017 leading to high population immunity against further infection, thereby limiting capacity for sustained ZIKV transmission. The seasonality in ZIKV transmission affected the rate of infection, but due to high connectivity between cities this had little impact on the eventual depletion of susceptible populations. Looking forward, incidence is expected to be low in 2018. This provides optimistic information for affected communities, but limits our ability to use prospective studies to better characterise the epidemiology of ZIKV. The continental-wide analysis illustrates much commonality between settings, such as the relative annual incidence, and the connectivity across LAC, but questions remain regarding the interpretation of the varied data for ZIKV.",

A sensitivity analysis confirmed that only a small number of observations were susceptible to large changes in surveillance prior to April 2016 and after January 2017, making the reported timing of the peak robust to changes in surveillance (Supporting Information S3).The model estimate of new infections within each city was aggregated to the country or state level (for Brazil and Mexico) and scaled to ZIKV cases, enabling comparisons with the available data. The maximal value of R 0 (t) and the best-fitting migration model (including the maximal leaving rate from cities) were estimated in the model fitting procedure. Parameters were estimated using approximate Bayesian computation -sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC) methods.34 ABC methods use summary statistics to estimate model parameters from qualitative epidemic characteristics. The sequential procedure of ABC-SMC means that each model of human mobility could be treated as a parameter. The prior and posterior distributions of selecting each model was used to estimate Bayes Factors to determine the evidence in favour of one model over another. Multiple parameter sets with equivalent fit were produced during the model fitting, and were used to provide the mean and 95% credible intervals (CI) of parameter estimates, numbers infected between 2015-2017, timing of the peak in the epidemic and projections of the numbers of ZIKV cases in 2018. The distribution of the timing of the peak was compared to the data using Bayesian posterior checks. The values correspond to probability that the data take a value less than or equal to the cumulative distribution function of the model, and values between 0.01-0.99 can be interpreted as evidence that the data and model estimate come from the same distribution. For each country the time series of reported cases were compared to the normalised model incidence. We compare the total number of reported cases to the estimated median (and 95% CI) number of infections to estimate the country-specific probability of reporting a case per infection.",

The average number of days where R 0 (t)>1 varied from 116 days days (Costa Rica) to almost year-round transmission (several cities within Brazil (Belem & Salvador) and Colombia (Medellin & Cali), and Aruba and Curacao Islands). The maximal estimate of R 0 (t) was often higher within cities that also reported a longer window of transmission with R 0 (t)>1. However, several cities (including Boa Vista, Aracaju and Natal in Brazil) were estimated to have maximal R 0 (t) values above 2.5 with a relatively small window of transmission within the year. Despite the emergence of the ZIKV epidemic in early 2015 in north-eastern Brazil, the incidence of cases remained relatively low in 2015 (Figure 2D and S5 for plots of Brazilian States). All countries that reported cases in 2015 (Brazil, Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras, Paraguay, Suriname, Cuba, El Salvador, Mexico, and Venezuela) continued to report cases in 2016 and 2017, except for Cuba. For most countries, the largest number of cases were reported in 2016. Belize, Colombia, French Guiana, Honduras, Suriname and several Caribbean islands reported more than 2 cases per 1,000 population in 2016.

The relative scale of the epidemic in the first phase compared to late 2016 (the second phase) varied by country.
