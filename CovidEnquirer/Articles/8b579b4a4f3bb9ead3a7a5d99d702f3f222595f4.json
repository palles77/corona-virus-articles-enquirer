The various types of solids and the composition of the samples influence the results and there is no technique available today which is 100% efficient under varied circumstances. Negative findings may be misleading, because there is no guarantee that the virus cultivation system employed will reveal all the virus types present in the sample. For some sludges it is possible to detect viruses by direct inocula tion in cell cultures. Such a method may give 10-50% recovery, es sentially depending on a balance between the cell-toxicity of the samples, the tenacity of the virus to stick to the solids and the care given the cell cultures. In most methods viruses are extracted from the sample either by elution by high pH (8.5-11.5), by proteinaceous media, with chelating agents, agitation with solvents or by sonication. Adsorption to polyelectrolytes or precipitation at low pH, in both cases followed by elution by means of glycine,trisbuffer with EDTA, or beef extract has given good recovery from seeded samples and positive results from field work. Decontamination of samples is carried out in various ways.",

            "text": "Our first examination of virus in treated and untreated wastewater i90 \u0395. Lund was in the years 1964 and 1965. At first we were quite contended to leave out a spontaneous sediment from our wastewater samples, but when the results from swab samples invariably came out with much more positive samples, as Melnick and co-workers (19 58) had shown, we became suspicious. If a mere squeezing of a swab would do it , viruses in wastewater must be different from proper laboratory sus pensions, in fact the viruses must be solid associated. We became very careful not to let any fraction escape no matter how disagreable the samples were for inoculations (Lund and Hedstrom, 1966 , Lund, Hedstrom and Jantzen, 1969 . Wellings and co-workers (1975, 19 76) showed that 70-90 per cent of influent and effluent samples are solid-associated and point out that the techniques be ing used fail to address the question of solids-associated virus, i.e. virus that is an integral part of a solid as opposed to mere ly being adsorbed thereon. Moore and co-workers (19 74) reported among others that solid associated virus is infectious. It seems that in those years many workers become aware of the importance of the solid-associated virus and agreed with Schaub and Sorber (19 76) when they concluded that \"Many of the methods used to concentrate and assay viruses in natural waters and wastewaters do not recover those viruses adsorbed to suspended material. Although it complicates the problem of recovering viruses, virus adsorption to solids is real and must be considered in the assessment of any water\". Thus most of the virus detection methods for water and wastewater pub lished in those years must be quantitatively less than optimal.",

It seems that we might long ago have taken the consequences of these observations. For instance it seems quite reasonable that in the situation where virus examinations of various wastewaters and treat ments are so difficult and expensive to carry out we might get valuable guidance from analysis of BOD and suspended solids. We are seeking suitable indicators because we realize that faecal coliforms are not very helpful and may be we already have the necessary data at hand for evaluating treatment efficiency by looking at the routine determinations of BOD and suspended solids. Balluz (1977) reports that the efficiency of a treatment plant to remove virus is closely related to its capacity to remove suspended solids.",

When it is remembered that in pri mary settling about half the virus will go with the sludge and that the primary sludge has a volume of about 0.5 per cent of the raw wastewater from which it originates these findings are not surprising. In fact before we get methods for virus demonstration in primary sludge that give more than 10-fold and preferably 100 fold as much virus from sludge samples than from wastewater samples our methods for solid associated virus are probably not good enough, even if the wastewater methods were.",

These models may seem remote for the present subject of methods, but an important conclusion may be drawn: The ability of a soil to adsorb virus par ticles cannot be judged solely on the basis of the various tests which normally are employed to characterize a soil. The adsorption increases with increasing clay content, silt content, ion-exchange capacity and glycerol-retention capacity, but a soil could be ranked lower than other soils in any one or all of these proper ties and still rank highest in virus-adsorption ability. The con clusion must thus remain that although we know of a number of fac tors important also for desorption,. there are a number of unknowns and interactions take place, so that various solids may behave dif ferently under different circumstances. Many times the disagreable solid-associated virus situation has been to some degree avoided by the use of experimental columns and lysometers.

            "text": "None of the methods studied have employed more than a few virus types. Gayal and Gerba (19 79) observed a great deal of variability in the way various viruses adsorb to soil, even strain differences were found. It must be assumed that viruses may vary in a corre sponding way when elution is attempted. In our efforts to obtain good recovery from solids we should, however, stop and think if it matters too much if we get 30 per cent or 99.8 per cent recovery. As long as legislation mentioning exact limits for this or that is forced upon us we can probably accept such a situation.",

Goyal and Gerba (1979) have worked a little with a simian rotavirus and Smith and Gerba (1980) have de-tected rotaviruses in wastewater. That is a beginning. We are at a point where we have to admit that from many points of very the realitively easily grown enteroviruses are may be not the most im portant ones to detect. We now know that we have a need for methods for hepatitis virus, coronavirus, parvovirus in addition to the ones working for reo and adenoviruses. Suitable cultivation methods are not yet ready, but the importance of a number of newer viruses for gastroentestinal troubles in man and animals is recognized. ",

            "text": "Comparisons and evalua tions are difficult because so many variables are at play and few publications contain results obtained with different methods used on the same sample materials. The methods and reported results deal with viruses from various types of wastewater treatment sludges, sediments, soils, mixed liquors, plants and other solid containing materials. The samples examined contain indogenous viruses or seeded virus. Decontamination. Many publications do not contain any information on contamination problems. This seems somewhat surprising, as the samples often must contain bacteria and fungi even after sample treatment. In connection with direct inoculations ether (e.g. Lund, 1971, Lund and R0nne, 1973, Eisenhardt and co-workers, 1977) or chloroform (e.g. Subrahmanyan, 1977, Glass and O'Brien, 1980) have been reported. If ether was used on beef extract eluates samples can become toxic to cell cultures (Nielsen and Lydholm, personal communication), but for eluted samples filtrations seem to be the natural way of decontamination with little risk of losing virus.",
