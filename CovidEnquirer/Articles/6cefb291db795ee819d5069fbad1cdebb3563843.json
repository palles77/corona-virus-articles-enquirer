Symptom diaries were completed for each illness. Results: We followed 119 children (mean age 10 months; range 2-24 months) for 115 child years. The mean annual incidence of RTI per child was 4.2 the first year and 1.2 the second year of the study. At least 1 virus was identified in 67% RTIs. Co-infections were common (27% RTIs), with RhV, CoV, and AdV the most common co-pathogens. PIV was identified in 12% of RTIs with a high incidence of PIV4. The viruses with the greatest impact on our population were RSV, RhV and AdV. Conclusions: Using molecular techniques, viruses were identified in approximately twice as many RTIs as previously reported in a daycare cohort. Infections with newly identified viruses, such as HMPV and CoV subtypes were less frequent and severe than infections with RSV, AdV and RhV.",

[2] [3] [4] RTIs occur more often, and cause more hospitalizations, in children attending daycare centers compared to home care. [4] [5] [6] [7] Given the burden of RTIs in daycare centers, effort should be directed towards the pathogens causing the greatest impact. Few longitudinal studies have evaluated the epidemiology of viral RTIs in daycare, and none have used modern molecular diagnostic techniques. A previous epidemiological daycare study spanning 16 years from 1966 to 1982 identified a viral agent in only 31% of illness events, using standard methods. 2 Newly identified viruses, such as human metapneumovirus (HMPV), the newly identified human coronaviruses, and difficult to culture viruses such as rhinovirus (RhV) and parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 4 have not been similarly examined in the daycare setting.",

Cox regression models were used to determine independent risk factors for illness overall and for virus-specific infections. An indicator term was included in the Cox regression models to adjust for respiratory season and robust standard errors were used to account for multiple illnesses per child. Differences in the presence and duration of symptoms up to 10 days were evaluated using Generalized Estimating Equations with a robust estimator, accounting for multiple illnesses in individual children as described previously. 12 The prevalence of each respiratory virus at enrollment of asymptomatic children was compared to the prevalence at each child's first RTI using McNemar's test. A two-sided p value of <0.05 was considered significant. In analyzing viral loads, the maximal viral load for each discrete illness episode was utilized.",

Several recent publications have suggested that RhV is a significant trigger of asthma and cause of hospitalization, comparable to RSV. [19] [20] [21] A potential limitation of our study is the attribution of acute disease to asymptomatic shedding of a virus. We detected a virus as often in asymptomptic enrollment swabs as in illness swabs, most notably RhV, HCoV and AdV. RhV was detected in 20% of well infants by Van Benten et al., 15 and in 22% of asymptomatic individuals enrolled in vaccine trials. 22 The results of our asymptomatic swabs support the likelihood that RSV, PIV and HMPV are the cause of illness when identified, but more data is needed on the use of PCR for the identification of HCoV, AdV and RhV as the definitive cause of a particular illness.",
