The cleaved protein fused the viral envelop to the host cell membrane, inducing the viral gene to enter the host cell. Subsequent reports demonstrated that trypsin and other host proteases, by cleaving the surface glycoproteins important for membrane fusion, contribute to the spread of infection and the pathogenicity of many types of viruses, including paramyxoviruses and influenza virus [15, 16] . Serine proteases, such as trypsin, transmembrane protease serine S1 member (TMPRSS) 2 and human trypsin-like protease (HAT; also known as TMPRSS11D) are important examples of host proteases responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), which is essential for viral gene entry into the cell and the start of viral replication [17, 18] .",

Other types of serine protease inhibitors, including gabexate and aprotinin, also reduced the viral titers and RNA levels in the cells, and sivelestat reduced viral RNA levels. Camostat reduced the cleavage of an influenza virus precursor protein, HA0, into the subunit HA1. The cells expressed TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS11D (\u00bc HAT) protein at the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm, as well as mRNAs for TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 and TMPRSS11D. These findings suggest that serine protease inhibitors may inhibit the replication of influenza virus in HTE cells through the inhibition of HA cleavage by host proteases. Camostat and aprotinin also reduced the concentrations of the cytokines IL-6 and TNF-a in the supernatants. Among the protease inhibitors studied, camostat may be the most potent inhibitor of influenza virus replication and inflammatory cytokine production during viral replication.",

The precise reasons for the different potency of the inhibitory effects among the cell types are uncertain, but the greater expression levels of TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS11D in tracheal epithelial cells [35, 36] [20] reported that 500 mg/mL leupeptin did not inhibit the virus infection in MDCK cells. The concentrations of protease inhibitors required to inhibit influenza virus infection may differ among different types of epithelial cells.",

In the present study, the titers of the A/H1N1 pdm 2009 and the A/H3N2 influenza viruses in the supernatants were reduced by camostat at the concentrations of 10 ng/mL and above.

However, we added fresh medium containing camostat at two different time points (24 h, 72 h), and cells were incubated in a humidified incubator. We found that the medium volume did not change significantly after 120 h of infection. Therefore, the addition of fresh camostat in the medium would maintain the final concentration of camostat at 10 mg/mL.
