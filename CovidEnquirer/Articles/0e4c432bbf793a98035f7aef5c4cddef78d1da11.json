Central to these differences are the role of vaccines in disease prevention rather than treatment, the concurrent interest of vaccination policy in improving the health of both communities and individuals, and the focus on children in many vaccination programs. Formal discussions of ethical issues related to vaccination once concentrated principally on aspects of clinical research and specific topics regarding vaccine safety and financing. Recent events, such as outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, increases in parental vaccine hesitancy and refusal, and the 2014-15 Ebola outbreak, demonstrate the value and importance of a more comprehensive and sustained examination of vaccine ethics. Such an approach offers important insights into all aspects of the vaccine life cycle, from the earliest stages of research through deployment in national and global immunization programs.",

Here, the physiological consequences of a disease in an individual person must be considered in addition to the specific likelihood of acquiring that disease. As a result of successful vaccination programs, the incidence of many vaccine-preventable diseases is extremely low in the United States and other wealthy countries. This complicates efforts to convey the continued necessity of vaccines to parents, many of whom may have never seen or experienced the diseases being prevented. Globally, the risk of diseases is subject to wide geographical, national, and occupational variability. In all cases, high rates of vaccination among communities are widely credited with preserving the low incidence of many vaccine-preventable diseases. 1 The benefit of high vaccination rates highlights a key difference between the ethics of treatment and the ethics of prevention. Prevention, specifically the prevention of infectious diseases through vaccination, has important implications for individual people and communities. While considerations relative to justice and the allocation of scarce resources have 84 ethical relevance to some treatment decisions, rarely are they primary factors in how care is delivered.",

These values are often in alignment, but for some, they present competing arguments regarding the decision to vaccinate. Central to this debate is herd protection, the indirect benefits that result from high vaccination rates in a community and provide additional protection to vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals alike. For some parents or patients, the benefits of vaccination may be seen as being outweighed by the associated risks and costs, however small or unlikely they may be. This is a particularly possible scenario for vaccines against diseases that have virtually disappeared in wealthy countries partly as a result of successful vaccination programs.

Young children are ethically vulnerable because they cannot exercise their own autonomy to mediate issues of risk and benefit. With a majority of vaccinations in the United States and other countries recommended for children in the first 24 months of life, vaccine recipients are typically among the most ethically vulnerable of populations. Attention by vaccine stakeholders to vaccine-related risks, whether confirmed or alleged, is understandably heightened with respect to children, as is the importance of the potential benefits of routine, on-time vaccination. While striving to make decisions that are in a child's best interests, parents and guardians must navigate a sea of at times conflicting information related not only to vaccines, but also to all aspects of their child's medical care.

While specific requirements vary among states, all require that children receive a series of vaccinations as a condition of attending public schools or state-licensed daycare facilities. 47 Every state allows for exemptions based on medical grounds, and nearly all also accept religious or philosophical reasons, although not every state includes all three types of exemptions. 48 No topic related to vaccine ethics in the United States is the subject of more public scrutiny and, at times, controversy than state vaccination requirements. The debate reflects not only the common tension in public health policy between individual (or parental) autonomy and the public good, but also questions over the role and extent of government intervention to protect the well-being of children. Requirements promote vaccination for individual children, while also striving to limit the potential transmission of diseases among communities to the greatest extent possible. School-entry requirements have long been seen by public health officials as essential to maintaining vaccination rates sufficiently high to preserve herd protection, particularly when other vaccine education and promotion efforts have failed. 49 The high vaccination rates associated with herd protection offer benefits against vaccine-preventable diseases to all members of a community, including those too young to receive vaccines, those unable to do so because of medical contraindications, and those who were vaccinated but did not generate the typical, adequate immune response needed for personal protection.",

However, few contemporary ethical models place autonomy absolutely above all other considerations. Instead, respect for autonomy is typically one of several factors that should be examined in light of other relevant considerations as part of ethical deliberation and decision making. There is a compelling argument that the lives saved and suffering prevented by vaccination outweigh the potential infringement on personal autonomy created by school mandates. While one may be free to make severe in those nations but uncommon or mild in developed countries. Owing to the limited profitability of such vaccines, manufacturers are often reluctant to invest in these efforts, with occasional exceptions for diseases relevant to national security or biodefense. 57, 58 Much of the remaining work, at both early and late stages of development, is therefore supported by private philanthropies, nonprofit entities, and public-private partnerships. These efforts should continue to be encouraged so that the benefits of vaccination may be more equitably distributed among all populations. For vaccines developed by corporate manufacturers, work should continue to develop financing arrangements that ensure that existing products are available to populations in developing countries that in many cases stand to benefit most from them.",

Advocates of this view believe it would clearly signal physicians' unambiguous position on the importance of on-time vaccination, and it would reduce the theoretical risk unvaccinated children would pose to other patients in waiting rooms. Critics, including the American Academy of Pediatrics in a longstanding policy statement, believe dismissal of patients in this context should be reserved for the very rare circumstance when conflicts between the views of the physician and parents present a profound impediment to the provision of care to the child. 52 In nearly all other circumstances, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends continuing to provide care, in hopes that a growing relationship of dialogue and trust between physicians and parents may lead to a changed position over time. Otherwise, children of parents who delay or decline vaccines may be left without advocacy and find themselves cared for by physicians who are willing to accept any (or no) approach to vaccination, a harmful outcome for those children and their communities alike. 4",

Vaccines were central to those planning and response efforts. [69] [70] [71] [72] Within weeks of the identification of a potential pandemic strain of influenza in April 2009, the process of developing seed stocks for an eventual vaccine began. 73 The total time required to produce the first doses of vaccine adhered fairly closely to the long-predicted estimate of 6 months. By the time vaccine was widely available in late 2009, public interest had waned, in part a result of a growing understanding of the relatively modest severity of the virus.",

Among the topics that have received scrutiny are the communication of accurate information about the severity of threats amid uncertainty, the efficiency of vaccine development and the need for greater production capacity and novel technologies, the adequacy of testing and postlicensure safety surveillance, the development of appropriate prioritization strategies, the structure of financing and distribution systems, and the allocation of vaccine to countries in the developing world.
