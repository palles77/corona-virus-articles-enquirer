To induce VRC formation, these viruses extensively rewire lipid metabolism. Disparate viruses have many commonalities as well as disparities in their interactions with the host lipidome and accumulate specific sets of lipids (sterols, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids) at their VRCs. Recent years have seen an upsurge in studies investigating the role of lipids in +RNA virus replication, in particular of sterols, and uncovered that membrane contact sites and lipid transfer proteins are hijacked by viruses and play pivotal roles in VRC formation.",

Viruses interact with host membranes and lipids at various stages of their life cycle. All positive-strand RNA (+RNA) viruses, which comprise many medically and economically important pathogens of humans, animals, plants and unicellular eukaryotes (Table 1) , remodel cellular membranes into unique 'viral replication compartments' (VRCs) to support replication of the viral genome (for review, see e.g. Ref. [1] ). VRCs are generally assumed to support replication by serving as a platform on which proteins involved in genome replication are concentrated and assembled into active replication complexes. Additionally, VRCs are thought to shield the viral RNA from cellular defence systems that patrol the cytoplasm to detect and eliminate intruders (e.g. pattern recognition receptors, RNases). The structure of VRCs and the mechanisms underlying their formation vary greatly between +RNA viruses, but universally depend on cellular lipid and membrane homeostasis. Here we will review how +RNA viruses rewire host lipid metabolism and describe contributions of different lipid categories to VRC formation and functioning.",

VRCs can be subdivided into two morphological classes ( Figure 1 ) (reviewed in Ref. [2] ). Invagination-type VRCs are formed by bending of the donor membrane away from the cytoplasm (i.e. by induction of negative membrane curvature), resulting in a secluded environment that contains all factors required for genome replication. These VRCs are usually connected to the cytoplasm by a narrow pore that allows passing of small molecules such as nucleotides but restricts access of the antiviral defence machinery. Viruses with invagination-type VRCs include flaviviruses, tombusviruses and nodaviruses (Table 1) .",

            "text": "Protrusion-type VRCs are generated by bending of the donor membrane into the cytoplasm (i.e. through induction of positive membrane curvature), resulting in singlemembrane and double-membrane structures. Viruses that generate protrusion-type VRCs include hepatitis C virus (HCV), coronaviruses and enteroviruses (e.g. poliovirus, coxsackievirus, and rhinovirus) ( Table 1) . Protrusion-type VRCs often form a network of tightly packed membranes, which has been proposed to protect and hide the viral RNA [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Biochemical support for this idea comes from work with poliovirus. In isolated poliovirus VRC networks, the viral RNA is protected from RNase digestion, but it becomes RNase-sensitive upon reversible disruption of the network (without the use of detergents, thus retaining membrane integrity) [4] , indicating that the RNA does not reside inside the VRCs. In line with this, pores allowing access to the VRC lumen appear to be absent from single/double-membrane protrusion-type VRCs [5] [6] [7] . Collectively, these data indicate that RNA replication takes place on the cytoplasmic face of protrusion-type VRCs. Importantly, for enteroviruses and HCV it was shown that VRCs are dynamic structures that gradually transform from single-membrane structures into double-membrane and multilamellar structures, reminiscent of autophagic structures [5] [6] [7] . The single/ double-membrane structures likely primarily support genome replication. The role of the multilamellar structures is less clear. In enterovirus-infected cells, they have been implicated in the en bloc release of virions in extracellular vesicles [9 ] . In HCV-infected cells, they may be the result of a cellular stress response [7] .",

[62] ). In yeast, PE methylation is the major route for PC production, which may (partly) occur at MCSs, at least at ER-plasma membrane MCSs [63] . In contrast, the Kennedy pathway is the major pathway for PC biosynthesis in most mammalian cell types. Nevertheless, it is tempting to speculate that viruses alter host lipid metabolism to locally produce PC via in trans PE methylation at ER-VRC MCSs, which would allow in situ PC production at VRCs without the need for relocalisation of the enzymes from ER to VRCs. Which biosynthetic pathway mediates PC biosynthesis at VRCs and whether this involves virus-induced MCSs, remains to be established.",

For example, TBSV accumulates PE at VRCs, possibly as a docking station for the viral replication machinery [64 ] . Correspondingly, replication of TBSV is sensitive to disruptions of PE biosynthesis. The requirement for PE is likely more widespread among tombusviruses, including some that form VRCs in other organelles. It has been speculated that, apart from serving a role in the recruitment of viral replication proteins, PE through its small head group and resulting conical shape may contribute to the induction of the negative membrane curvature that is important for the invagination-type VRCs [65] , but proof for this is lacking.",

PI(4,5)P 2 interacts with a novel amphipathic helical motif in viral NS5A and enhances the interaction between NS5A and the cellular ER-localised Rab1 GTPase activating protein TBC1D20, which is an important host factor for HCV replication [71 ,72,73] . Interestingly, the enteroviral protein 2C harbours a similar motif. Whether the presence of this motif is indicative of the accumulation of PI(4,5)P 2 at enterovirus VRCs, and what the role of PI(4,5)P 2 in enterovirus replication would be, remains to be investigated.

MCSs and PI4P play crucial roles in the biosynthesis of sphingolipids (reviewed in Ref. [74] ). The ceramide transporter (CERT) docks to the Golgi through PI4P and delivers ceramide, a substrate for sphingomyelin (SM) synthesis, from ER to Golgi at MCSs. Emerging evidence points to a role of sphingolipids in +RNA virus replication. This is best studied for HCV. Replication of HCV is sensitive to inhibitors of SM biosynthesis. SM binds the viral polymerase NS5B in vitro, supposedly to recruit it to SM-enriched detergentresistant membranes, and activates the polymerase, although this may differ between genotypes [75] . However, there is no evidence yet that SM accumulates at VRCs and recruits and activates NS5B in HCV-infected cells.",

            "text": "Schematic depiction of OSBP-mediated cholesterol shuttling at ER-Golgi MCSs (based upon the model presented in[12 ]). PI4KIIIb produces PI4P lipids at the Golgi. PI4P serves as a docking site for OSBP dimers. VAP-A/B transmembrane proteins link OSBP to the ER. OSBP transports cholesterol against the concentration gradient from ER to Golgi. A counterflux of PI4P along the concentration gradient provides the driving force for cholesterol transport. In the ER, Sac1 hydrolyses PI4P into PI to keep the PI4P gradient intact. (b) Model of cholesterol shuttling at ER-VRC MCSs as proposed for enteroviruses, cardioviruses and HCV (recently reviewed in[84]). Osh6 and Osh7) to the MCS between ER and the peroxisomes, while p33 also binds VAP at the ER. The ORPs mediate cholesterol accumulation at the peroxisome. Of note, Osh6 and Osh7 were shown to exchange PS instead of cholesterol for PI4P[85 ], suggesting that also PS may be shuttled to peroxisomes through the ER-peroxisome MCS. It has been hypothesised that the MCS slides along the surface of the peroxisome and that cholesterol accumulation primes the membrane for VRC formation in the wake of the sliding MCS[39]. line with the essential role of the PI4K-PI4P-OSBP axis in recruiting cholesterol, enteroviruses, EMCV, human Saffold virus (which like EMCV belongs to the cardiovirus genus), and HCV are all sensitive to pharmacological inhibitors of the respective PI4K and OSBP [13 ,15 ,16 ,19 ,21 ,22-28]. Importantly, not all viruses with protrusion-type VRCs depend on the PI4K-PI4P-OSBP axis. Picornaviruses from several other genera (e.g. The involvement of OSBP in cholesterol accumulation at VRCs suggests that cholesterol, at least in part, originates from the ER. Since cholesterol is synthesised in the ER, it would be logical to assume that VRC cholesterol is newly synthesised. Alternatively, cholesterol from other organelles may be distributed through the ER to the VRCs. Enteroviruses and cardioviruses likely do not rely on newly synthesised cholesterol, but instead depend on redistribution of pre-existing cholesterol pools [32]. Enteroviruses may mobilise cholesterol stores from lipid droplets [15 ]. Furthermore, they enhance endocytosis to increase uptake of cholesterol, which is delivered to VRCs via recycling endosomes [33 ,34]. This latter pathway may also involve a role of OSBP, since OSBP was recently shown to operate at ER-endosome MCSs as well [35 ].For HCV, inhibition of PI4K-PI4P-OSBP-mediated cholesterol shuttling disrupts the lipid environment of the viral proteins and alters VRC ultrastructure[21 ]. The PI4K-PI4P-OSBP-cholesterol system is likely also involved in picornavirus VRC formation, since inhibition of PI4KIIIa or OSBP alters global EMCV VRC organisation[19 ]. Viral rewiring of sterols may support multiple aspects of virus replication, as inhibition of the PI4K-PI4P-OSBP axis and treatments that reduce VRC cholesterol availability also alter proteolytic processing of the enteroviral polyprotein -which is a membrane-dependent process [36] -by viral proteinases[33 ,37].A number of unrelated viruses that generate invaginationtype VRCs also rely on sterols, while there is little if any evidence that they use PI4Ks or PI4P. This process is best understood for the tombusviruses tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV)(Figure 2c), a plant virus that in experimental settings can also replicate in yeast. TBSV forms VRCs in peroxisomes and recruits several ORPs to ER-peroxisome MCSs through its viral protein p33 [38 ]. Moreover, TBSV interacts with the ER-localised VAP homologue Scs2. Observations pointing to direct recruitment of ORPs were also made for the tombusvirus carnation Italian ringspot virus, which forms its VRCs in mitochondria [38 ]. Thus, tombusviruses shuttle sterols to peroxisomes apparently independent of PI4P. How they fuel sterol accumulation is unknown.",
