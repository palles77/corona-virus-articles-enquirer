            "text": "Heifers give birth to approximately 25-33% of all calves born on a dairy. This percentage can be increased by applying sex-biased semen from a number of superior sires, although conception rates are generally low, reaching about 60-80% of that achieved with conventional semen. Consequently, when using superior proven sires, heifers should represent the most advanced genetics in the herd. The genetic merit of artificial insemination (AI)-sired calves from heifers should be superior to that of AI-sired calves from older cows. Rearing and breeding of replacement heifers is critical to survival of the dairy farm because it represents 15-20% of total farm costs. Age at first calving is the single most important variable influencing the costs of raising heifers. Age at first calving could be defined as total days on feed since birth and is a function of the rate at which breeding weight (age) and conception are achieved. Once pregnancy is established, total days on feed become fixed. Costs associated with age at first calving include feed, labor, housing, interest on investment, breeding and veterinary health, and death loss. To reduce the costs associated with rearing heifers, one must reduce age at first calving or reduce feed costs because they represent approximately 60% of the total rearing costs. Reducing age at first calving is more easily achieved than saving on low-cost feeds given the lack of universal availability of inexpensive feeds to most producers. In a recent survey, the average cost to raise a home-grown heifer was US$100 more than that required to raise the heifer on a custom heifer-rearing operation.",

An evaluation of 6 million US dairy cow records from 1960 to 1982, however, found no appreciable change in calving age for any of six dairy breeds. Mean ages (months) at first calving for 1960 and 1982 were as follows: Ayrshire, 28.4, 28.6; Brown Swiss, 28.2, 27.8; Guernsey, 27.6, 27.4; Holstein, 27.3, 27.8; Milking Shorthorn, 27.7, 27.8; and Jersey, 26 .0, 25.9 months, respectively. Since 1980, however, age at first calving has decreased to current mean age ranging from 24 months for Jerseys to 28 months for Ayrshires, with the other dairy breeds falling in between these extremes. Holsteins had the smallest standard deviations for age at first calving (21.2-24.8 months) of any breed.",

Little biological rationale exists opposing the use of high-concentrate rations for dairy heifers, provided the daily gain is controlled and feed ingredients can be used to maintain a healthy rumen environment. Heifers on pasture have increased maintenance requirements, and depending on the nutrient quality of the pasture, less pasture nutrients may be available to support growth. If heifers have adequate high-quality forage, supplementing concentrates may not be necessary, particularly in pasture-based dairy systems.

Follicular waves are induced by increased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion. The largest or dominant follicle of the third wave generally matures during proestrus because of increased pulse secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and secretes estrogen to induce estrus. A preovulatory surge of LH secretion then causes ovulation. Ovulation occurs approximately 24-32 h after the beginning of estrus and subsequently the oocyte (egg) is released into the oviduct. At the site of ovulation, the ruptured follicle transforms into a corpus luteum. The corpus luteum produces progesterone necessary to prepare the uterus for a potential pregnancy. In the absence of a viable conceptus about days 16-17 of the 21-day cycle, prostaglandin F 2 (PGF 2 ) is secreted by the uterus to cause death or regression of the corpus luteum (known Figure 1 Characteristics of the bovine estrous cycle.

Diestrus ends as luteolysis is initiated and proestrus begins. Otherwise, the conceptus secretes a pregnancy signal (interferon-) to preserve the corpus luteum to allow pregnancy to continue. As the corpus luteum regresses in the absence of pregnancy, the dominant follicle continues to mature and will ovulate just after the heifer goes out of estrus, producing the egg that potentially will form a new conceptus upon fertilization.

The objective of this diagnosis is to find nonpregnant heifers so that they can be treated promptly to induce a new fertile estrus. Treatments utilized on nonpregnant heifers can include any of those short-term hormonal methods described previously. Historically, when transrectal palpation occurs, the heifer is given an injection of PGF 2 when a functional corpus luteum is palpated and subsequent behavior is monitored for visual signs of estrus. When synchronization of estrus is performed before first AI, the day of estrus is generally known when palpation occurs. If palpation occurs at 35 days after AI, one is generally correct in assuming that an estrus was not detected at 20-21 days post-AI; hence the heifer is on cycle days 14-15 when pregnancy diagnosis occurs. This is an ideal time to give PGF 2 to induce a fertile estrus. Given similar costs of palpation and a PGF 2 injection, any nonpregnant heifer is generally given PGF 2 and observed for subsequent signs of estrus.

The calving-ease percentage reported for each sire is based on the percentage of births in heifers when the calving difficulty scores were 4 or 5. In the Holstein breed, the average calvingease percentage is about 9%. For heifers, one should use sires with calving-ease percentages that are less than average while not compromising selection for excellent production traits of sires.

The key to efficient reproduction is proper growth and body weight by calving time. Sire selection should emphasize production traits and calving ease to maintain good production but facilitate fewer problems at first parturition. Because heifers are more fertile than their lactating counterparts, the best available proven sires should be used with a much greater cost-benefit ratio. Perhaps, the most effective management strategy to increase genetic progress and maximize profitability on a dairy is to use synchronization of estrus and ovulation before AI in all dairy heifers. Furthermore, using gender-selected semen in replacement heifers available from several of the AI companies is the most cost-efficient application of this new technology because of the greater fertility in heifers than in lactating dairy cows. However, one can expect a reduction in fertility associated with gender-selected semen of 60-80% of that achieved with conventional semen, with the realization of 85-90% of the resulting calves to be females.",
