The viral load, indicated by cycle threshold values, was high in the lower respiratory tract sample but almost undetectable in the throat swab and serum samples. After sequential sampling repeated every 2-5 days, MERS-CoV RNA was detected in sputum until 44 days after symptom onset, although viral RNA was inconsistently detected and patterns of viral load fluctuated ( 2). Other than initial fever (>37\u00b0C), clinical features differed for all 3 patients. The index patient had respiratory symptoms with cough, dyspnea, and myalgia. Patient 2 did not have a relevant medical history and showed mild symptoms. Patient 3 had underlying concurrent conditions and died 16 days after confirmation of MERS-CoV infection ( Figure 1 ). Virus isolation on Vero cells was attempted for each respiratory specimen from the 3 patients. The culture supernatant after inoculation was serially assessed for virus growth by using rRT-PCR and was used for blind passages every 3-7 days after inoculation. After 3 blind passages, cytopathic effect was observed, and we isolated the MERS-CoV strain from South Korea (KOR/KNIH/002_05_2015) from the Vero cells after inoculation by using the sputum from patient 2. We constructed a phylogenetic tree by using the general time reversible plus gamma model of the RAxML version 8.8.0 software (10) and FigTree version 1.4.2 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree) and by using complete genomes of the MERS-CoV isolate from South Korea (GenBank accession no.

(8, 9) . KSA, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; UAE, United Arab Emirates. Because the index patient initially concealed his travel history to Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Qatar, MERS-CoV infection was not considered and the patient was not isolated until MERS-CoV infection was suspected 7 days after symptom onset. Meanwhile, other patients and health care workers had multiple opportunities for exposure to the index patient (3) (4) (5) . The 2 contacts reported here had each been exposed to the index patient. Patient 3 was probably infected via droplet transmission in the hospital room. The hospital room, originally built for 6 persons, had been divided into 2 rooms and lacked ventilation. Furthermore, an air conditioning unit cycled the air in the room with the door and window closed. Thus, poor ventilation might have played a major role in droplet transmission. Detection of MERS-CoV RNA in the respiratory tract varies up to day 33 (11) (12) (13) . In this study, virus was detected in the respiratory tract, inconsistently, for up to 44 days.",
