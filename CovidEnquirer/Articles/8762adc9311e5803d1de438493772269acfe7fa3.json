In our assessment, we accounted for the distribution of incidence within China and the volume of travel from China with the passenger network. This strongly impacts the spatial pattern in the risk of introduction. Yet, our data does not allow distinguishing between travel for tourism or business. Contrary to Europe, where the majority of cases so far were Chinese tourists, it may be expected that cases in Africa will be more business related, given the strong commercial links between African countries and China leading to frequent trips between the two continents.",

For example, a significantly higher incidence in Guangdong than in other provinces would have a stronger impact on the importation risk of countries of cluster #2 than in countries from the other clusters. Also, flight bans put in place by some African airlines' companies serving China [18] may alter the risk in the future. However, the main transporters continue to fly from China to Africa via their hubs in Africa or Middle East (e.g. Ethiopian Airlines, the largest carrier in Africa, today operating almost half of the flights from Africa to China [19]). While certain provinces contribute the largest to the risk of specific clusters of countries, enhanced surveillance at the airports should consider that importation may however still occur from those Chinese provinces that appear to have a lower probability in our estimations.",
