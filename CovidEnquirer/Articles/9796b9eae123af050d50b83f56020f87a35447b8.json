Virions are more resistant to physical stress than genomes but are susceptible to humoral immune control. Virus genomes can be maintained in host cells by limited gene expression and can evade the host immune response. Nevertheless, to exist as a species, virus replication and transfer to a new host are essential. These processes are associated with the production of antigenic proteins that make the virus vulnerable to immune control mechanisms 'warning' the host of the presence of an invader. However, viruses have evolved strategies to evade such immune control mechanisms, and the list of these strategies forms the 'Who's who' of today's immunology.",

Because of the low fidelity of RNA polymerases, viral RNA genomes comprise a collection of RNA species (quasispecies) with random mutations. Therefore, in RNA viruses the generation and selection of variants with different antigenic properties that can evade recognition by neutralizing antibodies is common. Genetic VIRUSES must be extremely successful predators as they depend on living cells for replication. Almost all living species represent prey for a viral invader. Viruses have coevolved with their hosts and therefore have limited pathogenicity in an immunocompetent natural host. In turn, probably as a result of the constant evolutionary pressure from viral invaders, higher vertebrates have developed a complex immune system. Only in the last decade have we have caught a glimpse of what viruses do beyond invading cells for replication. For millions of years viruses have 'studied' cell biology and immunology the hard way, to acquire and defend an ecological niche. It is remarkable that, in the process, individual virus families have targeted many common immunological principles.",

Although this confers the advantage of being able to use mutation to escape immune control, there is little room in the genome to allow immune defences to be encoded by individual genes. The proteins encoded by RNA viruses are therefore multifunctional. This particular constraint is less rigid for DNA viruses as their genome size allows a larger number of genes to be devoted to host control. In the case of herpesviruses and poxviruses, these genes probably account for \u03fe50% of the total genome. variability can also generate variant peptide sequences that are either new antigens or that do not bind to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules at all.",

Viruses protect the membranes of infected cells and the lipid envelopes of virus particles from complement lysis by encoding homologs of inhibitors of the membrane-attack complex.

Inactivation of poxvirus cytokine receptor genes results in virus attenuation in vivo but, interestingly, deletion of the VV IL-1\u2424R enhances virus virulence and the onset of fever, suggesting that the purpose of some immune-evasion mechanisms is to reduce the immunopathology caused by viral infection 18 . Herpesviruses and poxviruses modulate the activity of chemoattractant cytokines or CKs that regulate leukocyte trafficking to sites of infection 16, 18, 22 . Virus-encoded CKs are either antagonists that block leukocyte recruitment to sites of infection, or agonists that could enhance the recruitment of cells that support viral replication or prevent Th1 anti-viral responses. Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) chemokine 1 (MCK-1) activates monocytes in vitro and increases monocyte-associated viremia in vivo 23 . HIV Tat is partially homologous to CKs and is a potent monocyte chemoattractant 24 . Herpesviruses encode many CK receptors (vCKRs) but their function is not clear. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated virus [human herpesvirus ] open reading frame (ORF) 74 is constitutively activated and induces cell proliferation, which might favor virus replication. vCKRs encoded by HCMV and HHV-6 reduce the amount of the factor regulated upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) in tissue culture and/or its transcription and might inhibit CK activity locally 16, 25 . A role for vCKRs in vivo has been shown for MCMV. vCKs and vCKRs might contribute directly to pathology. The angiogenic properties of HHV-8 macrophage inflammatory protein 1 (vMIP-1) could account for the increased vascularization found in HHV-8-associated tumors, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) US28 mediates vascular smooth muscle cell migration and perhaps vascular disease 26 , and expression of HHV-8 ORF74 in transgenic mice results in Kaposi's-sarcoma-like lesions 27 .",

Cellular proteins are degraded by the proteasome, the complex major intracellular protease, and the resulting peptides are translocated by transporters associated with antigen processing (TAP) molecules into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they contribute to the assembly of MHC class I molecules 1, 11, [32] [33] [34] transport either specifically or generally (Table 6 ). Viruses use various mechanisms to modify the maturation, assembly and export of MHC class I molecules. To date, no cellular homologs have been found for the proteins and functions that target peptide processing, transport and MHC maturation. With few exceptions 35 , the viral proteins bind their target molecule directly. There is only limited functional homology and no sequence homology among the different viral effectors. Nevertheless, the general outcome of these functions is the same: downregulation of MHC class I molecules or of some MHC class I alleles. The study of MHC class I regulation has revealed additional genes in herpesviruses of different species [36] [37] [38] , which might affect many cell types or only those tissues relevant for virus maintenance.",

NK cells, the first line of cellular defence against viruses, have receptors for certain MHC molecules. Some of these receptors silence the cytolytic machinery of NK cells and act as killer cell inhibitory receptors (KIR). Other receptors, designated leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LIR), are expressed mainly on monocytes and B cells. Engagement of an NK receptor can alternatively result in NK activation as not all receptors have immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) in their intracellular domains. The HCMV protein UL18 and the MCMV m144 protein, which are homologous to MHC class I, could be associated with NK killing, and UL18 is instrumental in the identification of LIR-1. In addition, the HCMV UL40 protein provides a peptide selectively required for the maturation of the HLA-E molecule, an NK target 39, 40 . However, clinical isolates of HCMV confer a much stronger NK resistance than the laboratory strains sequenced and tested so far, and this resistance is unrelated to MHC class I expression and LIR-1 (Ref. 41) . Clinical isolates carry additional genes, and in vitro propagation has probably led to a loss of certain NK-specific gene functions.",

Adenovirus, MCMV and HCMV affect MHC class II transcription but the target in the signal cascade, although known to be different for these viruses, has not been defined and the viral gene or genes responsible are unknown. At the post-translational level, the HCMV US2 protein, which affects MHC class I, apparently also translocates the DR\u2423 and the DM\u2423 chain into the cytosol for degradation by the proteasome. Another target involved in interference with MHC class II function is the shuttling between endosomal peptide loading and surface expression. Human papilloma virus (HPV) and HIV Nef affect vesicle traffic as well as the function of the endocytic machinery. Accordingly, in addition to MHC class II, other proteins that use this pathway, for example the CD4 molecule, are also affected. ",

Additionally, it is unclear when and why a virus deploys one specific function rather than another. Many questions therefore remain unanswered, including which genes are needed during primary infection to 'conquer the territory'; which genes are required to support active replication; and which genes are required to ensure transmission to a new host in the face of a vigorous host immune response? Moreover, why is there such complexity and functional redundancy? Is there a hierarchy in terms of general importance or do some functions operate only in certain tissues? Is complexity and redundancy a viral strategy that enables viruses to infect individuals resistant to some functions? Are the functions of an individual viral gene modulated by its genetic context, and is there any evidence for cooperativity? To date, we only have limited information because the construction of virus mutants and the in vivo testing of the predicted gene function is still in its infancy and, additionally, owing to the species specificity of many viruses, this information can only be gathered from some animal models.",
