On March 23, the index patient (neonate A), aged 3 days, had feeding intolerance and apnea. A nasopharyngeal swab specimen collected from neonate A was tested using a single-manufacturer rapid RSV antigen detection test (RRADT) at the hospital laboratory; the result was positive. The following day, because of concern about the possibility of more widespread RSV infection, RRADT was used to test nasopharyngeal swab specimens from neonate B, aged 1 month, who had resided in a different hospital room in the NICU and had developed an increased oxygen requirement, apnea, and poor feeding that day, as well as from two asymptomatic neonates who were hospitalized in the same room with neonate A; all three were positive. Later that day, nasopharyngeal swab specimens from the remaining 16 asymptomatic NICU patients were tested using the same RRADT; seven tests were positive, making a total of 11 positives. All 20 RRADTs were performed at the hospital laboratory.",

Sixteen nasopharyngeal specimens were negative for all 18 virus targets; three were positive for RSV-A, including the specimens from neonates A and B and from one asymptomatic neonate whose RRADT result was positive. A nasopharyngeal swab specimen from one other asymptomatic neonate with a positive RRADT tested positive for human coronavirus 229E by PCR. All nasopharyngeal specimen PCR results were confirmed at CDC. Therefore, among 17 specimens that were RSV-negative by PCR, eight were positive by RRADT, for a false-positivity rate of 47%.",
