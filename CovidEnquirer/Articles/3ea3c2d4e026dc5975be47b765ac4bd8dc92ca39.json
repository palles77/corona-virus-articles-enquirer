Hospitals and outpatient facilities funded operating deficits at the expense of capital investment, leading to aged radiographic equipment throughout the system. In clinics and hospitals in Ontario in 2003 it was not uncommon to find equipment in use well beyond the usual expected operating life.

HARP testing as currently mandated is insufficient to assess the entire process of creating an image and transmitting the report. Therefore, HARP testing is but a sampling of the process affecting patient risk and safety, not a comprehensive assessment of the efficacy and safety of the radiographic images and processes. Whenever a radiologist is concerned about the adequacy of the radiography equipment and images, the fact that the equipment has met the standards for HARP testing may have no bearing on the acceptability of the diagnostic image or the accuracy of the final report, Preparedness for pandemics should include the establishment of standards for the equipment and processes to achieve the highest sensitivity for subtle infiltrates, achieved at the lowest possible radiation doses, and communicated in the most timely and effective manner.",

The chief radiologist should be required to sign off annually on the adequacy of the radiography equipment as well as the entire imaging process including working conditions involved in the interpretation of studies and the preparation and communication of the report. The quality of the inventory of radiographic equipment and technology in hospitals and clinics needs to be reviewed regularly. Replacement must be planned for, independent of anticipated government funding. During pandemics radiography may need to be augmented by the use of CT in symptomatic persons with negative radiographs. Planning for pandemics requires planning for surge capacity for CT use. The radiology report needs to be in a format that will enable ongoing surveillance and analysis. This would be facilitated by the use of an electronic medical record. Radiologists should be included as part of the administrative teams dealing with ongoing surveillance for acute respiratory illness. The Chief Radiologist also needs to be a member of any committees dealing with potential pandemics.
