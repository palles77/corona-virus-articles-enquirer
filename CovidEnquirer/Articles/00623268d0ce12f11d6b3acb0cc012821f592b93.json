            "text": "Coronavirus envelope (E) proteins are short ($100 residues) polypeptides that contain at least one transmembrane (TM) domain and a cluster of 2-3 juxtamembrane cysteines. These proteins are involved in viral morphogenesis and tropism, and their absence leads in some cases to aberrant virions, or to viral attenuation. In common to other viroporins, coronavirus envelope proteins increase membrane permeability to ions. Although an NMR-based model for the TM domain of the E protein in the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV E) has been reported, structural data and biophysical studies of full length E proteins are not available because efficient expression and purification methods for these proteins are lacking. Herein we have used a novel fusion protein consisting of a modified b-barrel to purify both wild type and cysteine-less mutants of two representatives of coronavirus E proteins: the shortest (76 residues), from SARS-CoV E, and one of the longest (109 residues), from the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV E). The fusion construct was subsequently cleaved with cyanogen bromide and all polypeptides were obtained with high purity. This is an approach that can be used in other difficult hydrophobic peptides.",

Thus, despite the evident biological interest of coronavirus E proteins, to our knowledge, none of the envelope coronavirus proteins has been efficiently expressed and purified. Our initial attempts to overexpress SARS-CoV E, using poly-Histidine, GST, ketosteroid isomerase (KSI) [25, 26] or maltose binding protein (MBP) fusion tags were not successful. While the first three resulted in very low expression levels, MBP could not be efficiently purified from SARS-CoV E (results not shown).",

It is known, however, that they can be palmitoylated in vivo [21, 32, 33] , and that removal of these cysteines in MHV E resulted in deformed viruses [34, 35] . The study of the role of these cysteines is therefore an objective in their own right. In addition, these cysteines could potentially produce inter or intra-molecular disulfide bonds, leading to sample heterogeneity. Thus, the potential negative effect of disulfide bond formation in the final samples was examined by also purifying these proteins without cysteines. The latter samples may also be more amenable for structural studies.",

Electrophysiological recordings were carried out with a Port-a-Patch automated patch clamp system (Nanion Technologies GmbH, Munich, Germany). First, a planar bilayer was obtained by applying 5 ll of GUV solution onto the borosilicate glass chips, $1 lm aperture, in presence of a slightly negative pressure (\u00c020 mbar). The formation of the planar lipid bilayer on the aperture provided a seal resistance of >10 GO. Then, proteoliposomes containing the protein were pipetted onto the planar lipid bilayer. Currents were amplified with Axon Patch 200B amplifier (Axon instruments, USA). The data were acquired by using Axon Digidata 1322A and analyzed with Clampfit (Axon instruments, USA). The experiment was performed in a symmetric solution of 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM HEPES at pH 5.1, varying the voltages across the lipid bilayer.",

The monomer of wild type SARS-CoV E migrated with its expected mobility in 4-12% Nu-PAGE ($8 kDa) together with several higher oligomers, and mutants SSS and AAA produced only monomers (Fig. 5A ). In the presence of DTT (Fig. 5B) , wild type SARS-CoV E produced only two bands consistent with monomers and trimers, whereas the mutants were unaffected. The difference between triple mutants and wild type in presence of DTT suggests that cysteine side chains are involved in SARS-CoV E inter-monomeric contacts, but this involvement does not necessarily imply the formation of disulfide bonds. The side chain of cysteine is more hydrophobic [46] than alanine or serine, and the latter residues may lead to different secondary structure propensities relative to cysteine [23, 24] .",

For wild type full length SARS-CoV E no simple reversible association 'monomer:N-mer' model could be fitted to the data (N was tested from 2 to 15), probably because of the presence of disulfide bonds. However, in the presence of reductant TCEP, the data could be best fitted to a simple monomer-pentamer self-asso-ciation model (Fig. 6A-D) , with log K a = 17.5 \u00b1 0.2, similar to that obtained previously in similar conditions [19] for synthetic peptide TM in similar conditions. This suggests that the main contribution to pentamerization in SARS-CoV E is provided by the TM domain. The fact that we could fit the data in presence of TCEP to a monomer pentamer model demonstrates that disulfide bonds are not required to form pentamers. When we used the cysteine-less mutants (SSS or AAA) or IBV E and mutant AA, the data could still be fitted to a reversible monomer-pentamer equilibrium (not shown). For IBV E a good fit of the data could be obtained without the need of TCEP, consistent with the observation that no disulfide bonds were observed in SDS (Fig. 5C ). Purified SARS-CoV E has channel activity in lipid bilayers, although the film was unstable and recordings could only be obtained at two potentials ( Fig. 6E and F).",

This is confirmed by the infrared amide I band envelope (Fig. 7B ) obtained after reconstitution of SARS-CoV E protein in lipidic membranes, which shows a predominant band centered at $1655 cm \u00c01 , also characteristic of a-helices, although in some cases (e.g., DMPC) a small shoulder was observed consistent with some b-structure.",

From visual inspection, about 70% of the 1 H-15 N peaks can be detected. Using the triple cysteine mutant did not improve the quality of the spectra (not shown).

Indeed, the fluctuation between measurements observed for SARS-CoV E was not observed previously in TM fragments of SARS-CoV E [18, 19] , in proteolytic fragments after tryptic digestion (Supplementary File), or in similar viroporins, e.g., small hydrophobic (SH) protein from RSV [51] , which do not form large aggregates in SDS and PFO gels.
