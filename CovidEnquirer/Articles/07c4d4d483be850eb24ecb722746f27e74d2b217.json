The risk of virus infection and/or disease in a human population is determined by the characteristics both of the virus, and of susceptible individuals and of the host population such as innate and acquired resistance. In addition, virus transmission is affected by behavioral, environmental, and ecological factors. Virus epidemiology aims to meld these factors using quantitative measurements to provide a rational basis for explaining the occurrence of virus diseases and for directing disease-control measures, in particular the identification of outbreak sources and how best to implement prevention strategies. Epidemiology can also help to clarify the role of viruses in the etiology of diseases, understanding the interaction of viruses with environmental determinants of disease, determining factors affecting host susceptibility, clarifying modes of transmission, and the testing of vaccines and therapeutics on a large scale.",

Indeed, although clinical cases may often produce more infectious virus than inapparent infections, the latter are generally more numerous and, because these do not restrict the movement of infectious individuals, they can provide a major mechanism of viral dissemination. Epidemiologists recognize three different patterns of virus survival in mammalian hosts, distinguished through use of virus reservoirs: acute self-limiting infections with no reservoir, persistent infections with a reservoir in humans, and involvement of an animal reservoir.",

Small-droplet aerosols (<10 \u03bcm diameter particles) can create rapid explosive outbreaks and spread to more distant contacts (>1.8 m). These particles are more likely to settle lower down the respiratory tract. Second, large-droplet aerosols (10 to 100 \u03bcm diameter) sink to the ground more quickly, and therefore transmission needs closer contact between source and recipient (<~0.9 m); spread may be slow, intermittent, and without clustering. These particles are mostly trapped in the upper airways. Third, spread occurs when fomites, including tissues, ward equipment, and household objects become contaminated with respiratory secretions or aerosol droplets and contacts transfer this material to their own respiratory tracts; this mode of spread particularly involves those in close contact with others under conditions of poor hygiene (Box 13.1).",

In temperate climates, arbovirus infections transmitted by mosquitoes or sand-flies occur mainly during the summer months when the vectors are most numerous and active. Infections transmitted by ticks occur most commonly during the spring and early summer months. More interesting, but also more difficult to explain, are the variations in seasonal incidence of infections in which humans are the only host. Table 13 .5 shows the season of maximal incidence of several human respiratory, enteric, and generalized infections. In temperate climates most respiratory infections are mainly prevalent in winter or to a lesser extent in spring or autumn. Annual winter outbreaks of severe respiratory syncytial virus infections in infants are a feature in temperate climates ( Fig. 13 .3); epidemics of influenza also occur almost exclusively in the winter, but these may vary greatly in extent from year to year. Many of the rash diseases of childhood transmitted by the respiratory route reach a peak in the spring. Among the enteric virus infections, seasonality varies with the etiologic agents: the incidence of a number of enterovirus infections (in common with most enteric bacterial infections) is greatest in the summer, but caliciviruses show no regular seasonal patterns and rotaviruses tend to be more prevalent in the winter months. Infections with the herpesviruses (HSV, cytomegalovirus, and EB virus), all transmitted by intimate contact with saliva and other bodily secretions/excretions, show no seasonal variations in incidence; neither do other sexually transmitted diseases. The patterns shown in Table 13 .5 are found in both the northern and southern hemispheres. Different factors probably affect seasonality in the tropics, where wet and dry seasons tend to replace summer and winter. The peak incidence of measles and chickenpox is late in the dry season, with an abrupt fall when the rainy season begins, whereas influenza and rhinovirus infections reach a peak during the rainy season.",

As a result, most people no longer had acquired immunity by the time they reached adolescence. For reasons still unknown, primary infection in older children and adults with poliovirus or hepatitis A is more likely to cause clinical disease, compared to infection at a young age. The consequence was a paradoxical increase in clinical disease following this improvement in living standards. This was exemplified most strikingly in \"virgin soil\" epidemics occurring, long before the vaccination era, in isolated communities with no prior experience of the virus; most of the deaths occurred in adults. Finally, countries with advanced living standards began to see a reduction in the total numbers of infections and of clinical disease, as virus circulation declined even further. Both biological and sociological factors may play a role in these seasonal variations. Measles, influenza, and vaccinia viruses survive in air better at low rather than high humidity, whereas polioviruses, rhinoviruses, and adenoviruses survive longer at high humidity. All survive longer in aerosols, and at lower temperatures. These situations correspond with the conditions prevalent during those seasons when infections due to these viruses are most prevalent. It has also been suggested that there may be seasonal changes in the susceptibility of the host, perhaps associated with changes in nasal and oropharyngeal mucous membranes, such as drying as a result of smoke, central heating, or air conditioning.",

In places subject to monsoonal rains, the onset of the rains early in summer is accompanied by a greatly reduced movement of people, both in daily life and to fairs and festivals.

For many infections, a reservoir is maintained by a natural cycle between a particular arthropod species and a wild vertebrate species, for example a bird or mammal. Domestic species may become involved, with or without showing disease, and these may help amplify the infection and bring it closer to human habitation. Further species including humans may then become infected, but if they do not provide a source for further arthropod infection, they function as dead-end hosts. Finally, for some viruses a human-arthropod-human cycle occurs, either continually or in situations of high arthropod and human population density. Reproduced from Flint, S.J. et al., 2009.

The low body temperature of these species has been thought to favor persistent infection, with recrudescent viremia occurring when normal body temperature returns in the spring. Although demonstrated in the laboratory, this mechanism has never been proved to occur in nature.

In all cases the denominator (total number of persons at risk) may be general, that is the total population in a state or country, or it may be a specific cohort of individuals known to be susceptible or at risk. The latter is often equated with the number of persons in a specified population who lack antibodies to the virus of interest (\"susceptibles\"). In each situation it is imperative to be clear about the nature of the denominator. All rates may be affected by various attributes that distinguish one person from another: age, sex, genetic constitution, immune status, nutritional status, and various behavioral parameters. The most widely applicable attribute is age, which may be linked with immune status as well as various physiological variables. The incidence, or attack rate, is a measure of the number of events over time, for example, per month or per year, and is especially useful for acute diseases of short duration. The denominator includes both the population size and time frame, and incidence rates are usually expressed as cases per standard population size (e.g., 100,000) per standard time (e.g., one year). It will be immediately apparent that two additional aspects are important. First, it is usually the case that not all members of a population are susceptible, for example because of prior infection leading to immunity. Thus, an incidence rate recorded in a total population may produce a lower figure than a more targeted incidence rate based on those who are truly susceptible. Second, with nearly all viruses, not all infected individuals develop clinical disease, and many infections go unrecognized. Thus the incidence rate of clinical disease is invariably lower than the incidence rate of total infections. The ratio of clinical to sub-clinical, or inapparent, infections varies widely between different viruses. For example, measles infections are almost always clinically apparent, whereas less than 1% of those infected with encephalitogenic arboviruses or with polioviruses develop encephalitis or poliomyelitis, respectively (Table 13 .2).",

Control measures look to reduce the value of R to below 1.",

The details of these relationships depend on the mode of transmission [e.g., direct contact transmission, indirect contact transmission (fomite transmission), sexual contact transmission, vector-borne transmission]. Equations used to calculate R 0 have been developed which take into account the impact of life expectancy, duration of protection due to maternal antibody, the duration of protection afforded by a vaccine, etc. Many active immunization policies and programs take such calculations into account.",

This was a particular difficulty in estimating the value of R 0 during the SARS epidemic as a small number of individuals spread the virus to a disproportional greater number of secondary cases. Why this happened remains unclear, but it is known that some persons infected with other respiratory tract infections can shed larger than average amounts of virus. Importantly, this initial variation can be considerable, and greater variation can lead to more severe outbreaks. Fortunately, the value of R 0 for SARS was around 3, somewhat more than for Ebola but considerably less than figures computed for smallpox and measles. Interestingly, SARS is also similar to smallpox in having a generation time (T) of approximately one week and \u03b8 with a value of 0.11. The significance of this is that the quarantine and isolation of SARS cases were predicted as effective, as indeed was the case. Quarantine measures also have the benefit of allowing for more accurate estimates of \u03b8 as the time from contact to onset of symptoms can be accurately defined.",

            "text": "Models have inherent difficulties in predicting just how large an epidemic will be. This in the main is due to the enormous difficulty in measuring how individuals interact with each other within their communities. Most models assume a uniform mix of people, each having the same probability as all others in terms of coming into contact with an infected person. This might be true at the local level, but becomes increasingly invalid as individuals move between communities, cities, and national boundaries. One individual may travel from one subpopulation to another, introducing the pathogen to a completely new population of susceptible individuals. In this case, the size of an outbreak is determined by the behaviors of a relatively small number of infected individuals. In the end, the final size of an epidemic and its duration is determined by the structure of the population as much as it is by R 0 , and estimates of epidemic size need to recognize a series of subpopulation structures through which an infected individual may pass. Therefore epidemics are the result of smaller local outbreaks within subpopulations where most transmission occurs, accompanied by much broader spreading by a small number of infected individuals: increasingly over the past 50 years, this process of seeding has been the result of longdistance air travel.",
