During fall 2015, a universal hospitalwide visitor policy allowing families to identify a fixed list of up to 6 nonparent, nonlegal guardian persons as visitors was adopted with the approval of a family advisory group in an effort to standardize practice across the hospital and reduce the potential risk of acquiring community pathogens during hospitalization.

Health care-acquired respiratory viral infections were defined as a positive nasopharyngeal respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction panel (detects respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1-3, coronavirus, and human metapneumovirus), respiratory syncytial virus antigen, or influenza A or B antigen obtained on or after hospital day 5 in a child without a previous positive test either during or in the 30 days preceding his or her hospitalization. Positive tests obtained before hospital day 3 were defined as infections present on admission. Testing obtained between hospital day 3 and 5 were excluded to account for incubating viruses present on admission. Of note, no viral surveillance screening programs exist at CCHMC; all testing performed is at clinicians' discretion guided by clinical symptoms. No additional infection control interventions directed against respiratory pathogen transmission were implemented between the pre-and postintervention seasons.",
