Pandemic Influenza Advisory Committee, 2008). The risk of under-or misdosing using the disc inhaler was seen as a major barrier for Relenza, especially in those patients that find it hard to breathe and/or have asthma. However, Relenza was recognized as being more appropriate for children with renal insufficiency and pregnant women (Scientific Pandemic Influenza Advisory Committee, 2008) . In addition, a stockpile of Relenza was seen as appropriate to prepare for the possible emergence of Tamiflu resistance. Relenza was also planned for use to prevent and treat influenza in frontline health workers at the earliest outset of Tamiflu resistance emergence (Scientific Pandemic Influenza Advisory Committee, 2008) . On the balance of these factors, the United Kingdom acquired sufficient stockpiles of Tamiflu to treat 25% of the population, including prophylaxis and therapeutic prescription of the antiviral. This stockpile was further increased to cover up to 50% of the population at the outset of the pandemic (Fig. 3 ).",

Preexposure prophylaxic dosing was implemented to prevent infections before individuals were exposed to an infected contact, and postexposure prophylaxis dosing was implemented to prevent infections after an individual has been exposed to an infected contact. The clinical benefits acquired from antiviral treatment were maximal when given within 48 h of symptom onset, most notably reducing the time to symptom alleviation by roughly half of 1 day, increasing to 1 day in cases where influenza has been confirmed by laboratory tests (Team PIP, 2013) . Early treatment with NAIs compared with late treatment significantly reduced mortality in hospitalized patients by 62% (Team PIP, 2013) . Antiviral prophylaxis was more than 80% effective in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza when initiated within 48 h of initial contact (Team PIP, 2013) .

Rates of secondary bacterial pneumonia among patients admitted to hospital with influenza have varied from 0.6% to 46% (Team PIP, 2011b) . Influenza infection predisposes to secondary bacterial infection due to a combination of respiratory mucosal damage and a reduced capacity to mount an immune response to bacterial invasion (Team PIP, 2011b) .

Hence, the risk of sewage work failure from exposure to elevated levels of Tamiflu during an influenza pandemic remains theoretically possible (Slater et al., 2011) . The extent to which sewage works \"fail\" remains the next question. Total failure to treat raw sewage would mean the release of untreated sewage into the receiving rivers, some of which are the source of drinking water for major cities, such as the River Thames is for London. Such a release would result in the loss of fish and other sensitive aquatic lives downstream of any failing sewage works. It remains unclear as to the likelihood of pandemic quantities of drug resulting in incomplete treatment of sewage before discharge into the river. Antibiotics are designed to have a biostatic or lethal effect on a wide range of microorganisms. They are thus capable of inhibiting the growth and function of microorganisms in sewage works . The degree to which this inhibition could and would be observed remains unclear as there are numerous complicating factors that make predicting inhibition of microorganisms in sewage works based on antibiotic concentrations extremely difficult to determine. All sewage works receive relatively high concentrations of a very broad mix of antibiotics all the time Singer et al., 2014) . This constant influx of these drugs and antibiotic-resistant microorganisms into sewage works contributes to the resilience of sewage works as much as it can contribute to the risk of its failure.

Wildfowl is attracted to the nutrient-rich, warm sewage outflows, exposing them to relatively high environmental concentrations of Tamiflu. The colocation of wildfowl and Tamiflu means that there is a risk of the avian influenza virus, naturally found in many wildfowl, to develop Tamiflu resistance. The concentration of Tamiflu predicted to be present in highly sewage-impacted rivers, such as in the United Kingdom, was expected to be sufficiently high to select for the Tamiflu-resistance gene in avian influenza, which would ultimately increase the risk of the next pandemic influenza strain containing the Tamiflu-resistance gene (Gillman et al., 2015; Orozovic et al., 2014) . Application of ozonation to the sewage effluent would potentially reduce the load of antiviral released into the environment (Azuma et al., 2015) ; however, relatively few sewage treatment plants utilize such a treatment option, particularly in the United Kingdom, owing to the high cost and energy requirements.

These include isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and fluoroquinolones. The emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is one of the highest priorities in international public health.

Depending on the parasite, the antimalarial drugs include chloroquine, quinine sulfate, hydroxychloroquine, mefloquine, and a combination of atovaquone and proguanil (Malarone). Resistance to chloroquine has rendered the drug ineffective. The recommended treatment for malaria is currently a combination of antimalarial medications that include an artemisinin and either mefloquine, lumefantrine, or sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine. Quinine along with doxycycline may be used if an artemisinin is not available. Malaria is limited to areas where the Anopheles mosquito can live and reproduce, making the wider spread of this disease somewhat limited; however, the range of the mosquito vector can expand in a changing climate, increasing the risk to regions that might have previously been free of malaria.",

As of 2012, approximately 35.3 million people are living with HIV globally, with 1.8 million deaths from HIV/AIDS in 2010. HIV is transmitted from person to person through sexual contact, through blood, and during pregnancy to the child. There are several anti-HIV drugs: nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, which disable the protein needed by HIV to replicate (efavirenz, etravirine, and nevirapine); nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor, which forces the HIV to make faulty copies of itself (abacavir and combinations: emtricitabine-tenofovir (Truvada) and lamivudine-zidovudine (Combivir)); protease inhibitors, which disable required protein production (atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, and indinavir); entry or fusion inhibitors that block the HIV's entry into the target CD4 cells (enfuvirtide and maraviroc); and integrase inhibitors, which prevent HIV from integrating its genome into CD4 cells (raltegravir, elvitegravir, and dolutegravir). The use of these drugs is sufficiently high that they are now among the most frequently recovered drugs in waste water of countries heavily impacted by HIV/AIDS and reach concentrations over 100 mg/L (K' Oreje et al., 2012 Oreje et al., , 2016 . The implications of very high concentrations of antiviral in the environment and potentially drinking water have yet to be studied.",

There is no curative treatment for MERS-CoV. Symptomatic treatment includes convalescent plasma-containing MERS-CoV antibodies (i.e., blood from patients that have raised antibodies to MERS-CoV) (Publich Health England, 2015) and lopinavir (ABT-378), an antiretroviral of the protease inhibitor class that is nearly 100% bound to plasma proteins.

A massive epidemic of Ebola spread through three West African countries, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, in early 2014 resulting in 28,602 cases and 11,301 deaths, as of early 2016. Recent research has indicated the potential for a broad-spectrum antiviral for such RNA viruses. An RNA polymerase-inhibiting molecule called BCX4430 (Immucillin-A), an adenosine analogue, is incorporated into growing viral RNA strands, preventing further RNA synthesis and therefore viral replication. The biocompatibility of this drug makes it potentially at risk of impacting environmental organisms if the drug was to be excreted intact.

The disease causes sudden onset of fever with accompanying joint pains that can last weeks to years. Fewer than 1 in 1000 of infected individuals die from the disease, mostly the elderly and those with underlying chronic medical problems. The virus is most frequently transmitted from human to human within the blood carried by infected Aedes albopictus or Aedes aegypti mosquito. There are a number of animal reservoirs of the virus, including monkeys, birds, cattle, and rodents. This is in contrast to dengue, for which primates are the only hosts. There is no treatment for chikungunya other than for the fever and joint pain. There remains no vaccine for the disease. As the transmission of chikungunya requires a mosquito vector, it will remain constrained to the geographic range of the mosquito vector; however, it can still reach pandemic levels as the range of the vector is quite substantial (Kraemer et al., 2015) .",

Dengue can be found in other primates and was the original source of the dengue virus. The symptoms of dengue include high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin rash. The incidence of dengue has increased fourfold in the last 20 years. There are no licensed therapeutics available for treatment of dengue. Several antivirals have been investigated for their efficacy in treating dengue, including balapiravir, celgosivir, and chloroquine; however, none have shown beneficial effects on viremia or clinical outcome (Yacoub et al., 2016) . The inability to control the day-biting anthropophilic mosquitoes is the main reason for the global spread of dengue (Yacoub et al., 2016) . Promising avenues for breaking the transmission cycle of dengue have been to infect the mosquito with an intracellular bacterium, which reduces viral replication in the mosquitoes (Yacoub et al., 2016) . The virus' reliance on a geographically restricted mosquito vector limits infection to those who live and visit tropical environments (Kraemer et al., 2015) . Despite that limitation on its range, dengue is common in more than 110 countries and infects 50-528 million people worldwide a year, leading to half a million hospitalizations.",

It more recently emerged in 2014 in French Polynesia to take center stage among the most serious emerging public health issues in the Americas after it was transmitted to South America. The virus is transmitted by the same mosquito as the chikungunya and dengue viruses, typically causing relatively minor ailments such as rash, fever, and headaches within a week of being bitten by the mosquito. The virus has spread to over 17 countries in the Americas by early 2016. The possible link to microcephaly in unborn fetuses has put this relatively minor viral infection on center stage. There are no vaccines for the virus. No antivirals have been reported to be effective for Zika, but one must assume that the experimental treatments used to treat dengue and chikungunya will be tested for their efficacy in this related virus. Zika virus is arguably at the cusp of being considered a global pandemic risk, with increasing cases of its transmission via sexual contact, thereby forgoing the otherwise geographically limited mosquito vector.",
