In RNA viruses genetic recombination is defined as any process leading to the exchange of information between viral RNAs (King, 1988) . There are two types of recombination events: legitimate and illegitimate. While legitimate (homologous) recombination occurs between closely related sequences at corresponding positions, illegitimate (nonhomologous) recombination could happen at any position between unrelated RNA molecules (King, 1988) . In order to differentiate between symmetrical and asymmetrical homologous crosses, Lai (1992) defined the former as homologous recombination and the latter as aberrant homologous recombination.",

            "text": "Sequence rearrangements which suggest the existence of recombination processes have been found in numerous animal RNA viral genomes. The phenomenon of recombination among mRNA viruses was first demonstrated experimentally in the picornaviruses (Hirst, 1962; Ledinko, 1963; Pringle, 1965) and more recently in coronaviruses (Lai et al., 1985) . The defined molecular mechanism of these processes is not known. By analysis of both intratypic and intertypic crosses involving the same genetic markers, Kirkegaard and Baltimore (1986) found that independent inhibition of the replication of parental strains had an opposite effect on the frequency of intratypic crosses, supporting a discontinuous copy choice-based mechanism. Romanova et al. (1986) and Tolskaya et al. (1988) determined the nucleotide sequences at crossover sites in the genome of a number of intertypic poliovirus recombinants. They found that recombination occurred within the genome segments which had the potential to form secondary structure elements (Romanova et al., 1986; Tolskaya et al., 1988) . They proposed a model of recombination in which recombining RNA molecules form a local double-stranded structure. Banner and Lai (1991) found that within a hypovariant l-kb region of mouse hepatitis coronavirus, the legitimate recombination was nearly random, but subsequent passages caused selection at certain locations. This indicated that, at least in coronaviruses, the recombination hot spots resulted from selection rather than from specific sequences. Weiss and Schlesinger (1991) used deleted and mutationally altered Sindbis virus RNAs to study recombination in a region spanning the junction between the nonstructural and structural protein genes. All recombi-nants were found to be illegitimate and contained sequence insertions derived from the parental RNAs. One recombinant contained a stretch of non-Sindbis virus nucleotides (nt). The authors concluded that recombination between Sindbis virus RNAs may be analogous to that observed in bromoviruses (see Section 11,B).",

Nucleotide sequences of these RNAs are known (Ahlquist et al., 1984a) . One of the most-studied aspects of the BMV life cycle is the replication of its RNAs. Both in vitro (Ahlquist et al., 1984b; Bujarski et al., 1985 Dreher et al., 1984) and in vivo studies discovered minus-strand synthesis promoters within the 3'-noncoding region, the last. 134 nt of which form a tRNA-like structure (Ahlquist et al., 1981; Rietveld et al., 1983) . This structure also interacts with several tRNA-specific enzymes (Haenni et al., 1982) . Other sequences responsible for the completion of the replication cycle have been identified on RNA3 within the intercistronic region and in the 5'-noncoding region . The intercistronic region is comprised of the subgenomic RNA4 promoter (Marsh et al., 1988; Miller et al., 1985) as well as signals responsible for regulation of the plus-strand:minus-strand ratio (Marsh et al., 1991~) . The 5'-noncoding region contains internal regulatory sequence motifs (Marsh et al., 1989) that are thought to interact with cellular transcriptase factors in order to initiate plus-strand RNA synthesis (Marsh et al., 1991a) . In addition, a replication signal has been identified on BMV RNA2 by Marsh et al. (1991b) , who demonstrated that deletions of certain coding sequences inhibited the accumulation of this BMV RNA.",

A comparative analysis of amino acid sequences indicated that protein l a has at least two domains: one for a helicase and one for a capping enzyme, whereas 2a represents the catalytic unit. Mutations and deletions in these proteins were used to identify the regions active in RNA replication as well as regions responsible for interaction between them (Kroner et al., 1990; Traynor et al., 1991) .

Alternatively, natural selection processes could select for the best-adapted molecules from a random pool of recombinants. Replication competition between parental and recombi- DM4 RNAs in mixed infections. In fact, all the M4-and DM4-derived legitimate and illegitimate recombinant RNA3s examined, regardless of whether they had sequences derived from either RNAl or RNA2, were very competitive with the parental mutants . This indicated that progeny recombinants easily accumulated, because they easily outcompeted their parental RNAs. Figure 3 shows that all legitimate crossover events occurred within the long (197-to 220-nt) 3' region of M4 or DM4 (homologous among three BMV RNA components) and the corresponding part of either wt RNAl or wt RNA2. The illegitimate crosses were distributed differently. The majority of donor sites were located in the heterologous part of the 3'-noncoding region of wt RNAl or wt RNAZ. The acceptor sites were dispersed along the entire length of the 3'-noncoding region of M4 and region B of DM4.

            "text": "The bimolecular heteroduplex model can explain the occurrence of illegitimate crossovers found for RNA3 mutants containing antisense RNAl fragments. Since the recombinationally active region B of DM4 and the corresponding region of M4 were identical (except the deleted last 6 3' nt), the heteroduplex model predicted that the two systems could generate similar recombinants. However, we observed the unusual distribution of crossover sites on donor RNAl molecules obtained with DM4 infections. Specifically, we found that the majority of DM4-generated illegitimate recombinants contained the last 236 nt of RNA1. Since a short 74-nt RNAl-derived sequence (positions 162-236, counted from the 3' end of wt RNA1) is present within region A in the DM4 construct (Fig. 21 , a modified heteroduplex model can be proposed (Fig. 6 ). In this model three molecules interact. The first interaction is formed between a wt RNAl plus strand and a DM4 region A minus strand. The latter could be a part of the DM4-replicative intermediate. This heteroduplex is called arm B and it is energetically strong, extending theoretically 216 nt. The formation of a strong arm B might hold the donor RNAl in close vicinity of DM4 plus strands (which are also thought to be part of a DM4 replicative intermediate) and help to align and to form a short heteroduplex between plus strands of RNAl and DM4. This heteroduplex is termed arm A. The arm A heteroduplex is similar to the heteroduplexes described previously for M4 and DM4 recombinants (Fig. 41 , but it is energetically weaker than these. Arm C is formed between the plus and minus strands of DM4. The model predicts that crossovers occur between arms A and B by joining the donor RNAl plus strand (at position 236) to the acceptor DM4 plus strand (the position is variable). The main difference between the bimolecular heteroduplex model and the \"T-shape\" model is that the latter includes a supporting minus-strand sequence. This may enforce the observed crossover preferences between the plus-strand recombination substrates. A three-component model was also proposed by Kuge et al. (1986) to describe the generation of DI molecules in poliovirus. However, arm A is not included in that model. In order to obtain experimental data supporting our tricomponent model, construct DM4 was modified to alter the putative structure of the recombination intermediates. Construct DM4CC3 (Fig. 2) contained the 3'-noncoding region of DM4 with a heterologous CCMV insertion at position 162 of DM4 region B. The CCMV sequence represented the last 788-nt part of the RNA3 segment (Allison et al., 1989) . Such a modification was expected to change arms A and C, but not arm B of the putative trimolecular heteroduplex formed between DM4 and RNA1. Since arm B was postulated to be the main force of recombination at position 236 of RNA1, the trimolecular model predicted that DM3CC3 should generate illegitimate recombinants that have the hotspot junction site of RNA1. When tested on C. hybridum, the CCMV insertion significantly decreased the generation of illegitimate crossovers observed before in DM4 infections. The isolation of the recombinant DM4CC3-IA (Fig. 6) , having the invariable 236 nt from RNA1, supported the postulated role of arm B in recombination.",

            "text": "Differentiation between the two favored recombination mechanisms, template switching (TS) and breakage and religation (B+R), is necessary to understand the molecular basis of recombination. To address this question, we took advantage of the fact that the location of illegitimate crossovers generated by PN2(-) and its derivatives could be determined. Moreover, we used the facts that in the above system the ability of heteroduplex formation between the templates was required for recombination and that only RNA3-derived recombinants were detected. The crossovers should occur at the left side of the heteroduplex if recombination occurs according to the TS model (Fig. 5) . The right-side crossovers are less likely, because the unwinding activity of the replicase complex would destabilize the heteroduplex and finally would release the acceptor molecule. On the contrary, the B+R model predicts that the cleavage of both strands should occur within or at the right side of the heteroduplex in order to keep the RNA substrates together until ligation covalently joined them. Left-side digestions would release the long 5' region of RNA3 and the 3' RNAl fragments because of the absence of a double-stranded anchor. The participation of positive or negative strands in recombination does not change the above predictions. The observation that the crossovers found in recombinants generated by PNU-1 to PN4(-) were located invariably at or close to the left side of the heteroduplex favors the TS mechanism. The shift in the location of crossovers in PN6(-) to PN10(-) infections is even more supportive (Fig. 5) . This is because the replicase complex is expected to penetrate easier through the weakened or disrupted left side of heteroduplexes formed between PN6(-) to PN10(-) and RNA-1. Moreover, the presence of one to three nontemplate (mainly uridine residues) nucleotides at some crossover sites indicated the involvement of viral replicase through the enzyme stuttering during the resumption of RNA synthesis. A similar phenomenon has been described for turnip crinkle virus (Cascone et al., 1990) .",

Mutant D 1 had two additional uridine residues 3 nt upstream of the frame-shift insert.

As shown in Table 11 , L-1CP and L-2CP were infectious to C. hybridum, but construct L-3a was not infectious. The latter reflected the importance of the 3a protein for the BMV life cycle. Examination of progeny RNA3 molecules revealed that all local lesions induced with L-1CP and nearly 50% of lesions induced with L-2CP accumulated wt RNA3. In addition, RNA3 molecules containing partially removed inserts were detected. The infectivity of L-SP3' was much higher compared to that of other deletion mutants.

Since the two RNA3 mutants contain 74-nt portions of BMV RNAl within their 3'-noncoding region (seeFig. 21, the hybridization is perfect within the 214-nt-long arm B (only the upper part of arm B is displayed). Arm A is generated by hybridization between upstream portions of the donor RNAl molecule and the downstream parts of the acceptor plus strand of RNA3, and therefore is not perfect. Arm C arises by rehybridization of unwound parts of both SUPPOPTIBG %If DH4 P11A 3( -)",
