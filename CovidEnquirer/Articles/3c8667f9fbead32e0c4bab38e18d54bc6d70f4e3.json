            "text": "Public health (PH) efforts should aim to improve the social, economic, and environmental conditions in which people can live a healthy life. All activities concerning the health of populations are within the PH domain. Given the consequentialist nature of PH, its main goals are to preserve and promote the health of populations and reduce inequalities in health outcomes. 1 The characteristics of the multidisciplinary field of PH, lead to ethical issues being at the heart of the subject: it is a common good, with a preventative approach that is provided by the government. 2 PH is a collective effort, as its goals cannot be achieved by individual efforts; thus, it requires government action in addition to community participation. 2, 3 Public health ethics is a sub-branch of bioethics, which help PH professionals and health-related organizations to make some necessary trade-offs so that public health goals can be realized. The objectives and activities of PH make this area unique in terms of applying and overcoming ethical principles and moral norms. 4 The objectives of PH are related to moral norms, in particular, prevention of harm and beneficence, producing utility (optimization of benefits over harms) and justice. 5 Some PH interventions are still a threat to other moral norms, such as individual freedom and autonomy, privacy, and confidentiality. 5, 6 With the increasing threats of communicable and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and populations with chronic health problems, such as diabetes and obesity, it is necessary for PH professionals and other health-related institutions to address ethical conflicts in their policies and practices. 5 Given the objectives of PH, providing universal health coverage requires informed and correct decision-making, based on empirical evidence and moral judgment. For example, the goal of ending the AIDS epidemic by 2020 is only possible if people are being informed about their illness through voluntary testing and access to healthcare services. In addition, the elimination of stigma and discrimination is one of the key topics that should be addressed when planning for the prevention and control of the disease worldwide. 7 Moreover, the socio-economic burdens of NCDs are particularly severe in developing countries, accounting for 75% of all NCD-related deaths. Thus, in order to achieve sustainable development goals, the WHO has established global governance to address complex issues that could not be managed alone. These interactions have raised a range of ethical challenges, including conflicts of interests and governance issues. Transparency, accountability, and management of conflicts of interests are ethical issues requiring attention to prevent NCDs and chronic diseases. Therefore, policy-makers and governments have been working closely with food and drink industry partners to address a number of determinants and processes, which today are tackled by a set of institutions globally. These new challenges call for tools and methods for overcoming ethical conflicts and maximizing benefits. 8 The American Public Health Association identified 10 essential functions for the effective implementation of PH programs, 9 which resulted in the development of a variety of ethical frameworks. Initially, the following two concerns led to the formation of practical frameworks for ethical evaluation of PH: (i) public involvement rather than individual autonomy; and (ii) prioritization and allocation of scarce resources, especially in developing countries, which has raised the debate on justice. 10 So far, several practical frameworks have been proposed for the ethical evaluation of PH programs, but none are universally approved. 11e13 Most of these frameworks were based on common underpinning assumptions, but they were formed to address ethical issues either theoretically or practically. Kass 11 was the first pioneer who proposed a primary practical framework for ethical evaluation of PH, including six steps, based on two key values of social rights and social justice. Childress et al. 14 conceptualized general moral considerations in PH practice and introduced six justificatory conditions to solve conflicts in the context of PH. In the stewardship model proposed by the Nuffield Council on Bioethics 2007, 15 only practical recommendations for ethical decision-making were mentioned. On the other hand, given the debates raised about priority setting, especially in developing countries, ethical frameworks based on fundamental values of fairness and accountability have been proposed, which combine normative and empirical methods, and the involvement of all stakeholders and partners in policy decisions. 16e18 Thus, to enable legitimate and fair decision-making when considering priority setting in PH policy, the 'accountability for reasonableness' 19 framework was created, which was then developed by health system stakeholders in developing countries specifically for their requirements. 20e22 Given the evolution and specialization of these frameworks, Ten Have et al., 12 proposed a practical framework to evaluate overweight and obesity interventions, after providing an inventory of relevant moral norms. At the heart of the framework is a list of eight questions on the morally relevant features of a program, which is then followed by procedural recommendations for applying the ethical framework. Marckmann et al., 13 proposed an ethical framework to guide professionals in planning, conducting, and evaluating PH interventions. Their proposed framework contains an explicit normative foundation with five substantive criteria, five questions on the morally relevant features of a PH program, and seven procedural conditions to guarantee a fair decision-making process. However, the authors did not assess its practical application to determine the efficiency of the framework.",

In the first round, we emailed the list of general moral norms to 20 Iranian experts with expertise in biomedical ethics or PH policy and asked them to determine the relevance and importance of each of the norms by scoring with a 5-point Likert scale (1: very low; 2: low; 3: moderate; 4: high; and 5: very high). Overall, 14 of the 20 experts responded. Based on received comments and scores, the norms that scored 3 were merged with other norms, and then the median was calculated using a frequency distribution table for each norm. In the second round, the list of revised general moral norms, with median scores resulting from the first round, were emailed to the previous 14 respondents who were then asked to re-score each norm. Analysis of scores on the revised list of moral norms showed that all respondents were in agreement in terms of which components should be used in the structure of a practical framework. (C) After determining and validating the moral norms to be applied as structural components in creating the practical framework, it was further developed in six detailed steps (see the Results section). (D) To assess the efficiency of the framework, Iran's Fourth Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control was evaluated by the final users (program experts) of the framework. After obtaining permission from the head of the Center for Communicable Diseases and Iran's Ministry of Health and Medical Education (who had previous involvement in the project), two group discussion sessions were held with nine experts from the Ministry of Health and its affiliated universities. These experts were specifically chosen by the Director of the HIV/AIDS Control Office. In the first session, which lasted 2 h, after expressing the goals of the meeting and obtaining the oral agreement of participants, they were asked to identify ethical considerations in the form of potential strengths and weaknesses (ethical points) associated with the Fourth Strategic Plan of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control without using the framework. Then, to determine the content validity of the framework, participants were asked to rate the relevance, simplicity, and clarity of the resulting questions using the 5-point Likert scale. After summarizing the responses, the framework was refined and finalized at a meeting with attendance of those experts (content validity index [CVI] \u00bc 96.2%). Then, an evaluation session of the program, which lasted 3 h, was conducted using the developed framework and its application guide with nine previous participants, as followings: 1. Form an evaluation team, consisting of three ministry experts, three university experts, and three experts working in other relevant PH institutions; 2. Specify and balance the list of moral norms in PH policy and practice, in each domain; 3. Answer questions in the form of 'yes' or 'no' by mentioning the potential strengths or weaknesses (ethical points); 12 4. Make recommendations regarding ethical pitfalls based on weaknesses (negative points); 5. Evaluate the program by integrating the results from the evaluation of each domain and decision-making as: (i) the program is acceptable; (ii) the program is acceptable with some revisions; or (iii) the program is not acceptable. (E) In order to determine the total number of weaknesses and strengths (sum of the positive and negative ethical points) that may be obtained by evaluating Iran's Fourth Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control through applying the framework, the program was previously evaluated by three members of the research team. A total number of 50 negative and positive ethical points were elicited, and this was considered the reference point. Finally, to calculate whether there is significant difference between the frequency of provided answers as strengths (the number of positive points) and weaknesses (the number of negative points) before and after applying the framework, the number of ethical points compared with the reference was analyzed using the Mac-Nemar non-parametric test due to the abnormal distribution (confidence interval [CIN] \u00bc 99%).",

The more frequent the burdens of a program, the greater the evidence should be for the benefits. An autonomous choice is a decision that is not influenced by the interference of others or restrictions, such as inadequate understanding and awareness. 25 But in order to increase the effectiveness, they may be morally accompanied by harmful impacts, such as stigma and discrimination. 11 For example, the stigma associated with obesity can cause feelings of worthlessness and loss of will, in addition to lost opportunities, such as employment and access to healthcare services, and ultimately discrimination and inequality, deprivation and undesirable health outcomes. 12 'Stigmatization', 'violation of confidentiality', and 'disclosure of information' are more sensitive to data collection activities. In cases where an infection or disease is on the list of diseases to be reported, the necessary measures for information security should be considered in the program evaluation.

Thus, an analysis must take place to investigate whether the program can be adapted to minimize burdens, while maintaining the benefits, or whether there is an alternative intervention or strategy. Therefore, alternative interventions or strategies need to be reviewed. If there are two interventions or strategies to solve a PH problem, assuming that the benefits are not significantly different, it becomes a moral obligation to opt for the strategy with fewer risks of moral issues, such as autonomy and privacy. In general, less enforcement of compulsory measures and consideration of incentives results in less infringement of individual autonomy. For example, if evidence suggests that a voluntary screening program essentially tests the same number of people as a compulsory program, it is not morally necessary to enforce a mandatory program; or, if a disease surveillance system has the same effect using unique identification codes as it does with the national identification codes, it is morally preferable to use identification codes.",

Respect is one of the fundamental dimensions of well-being that is essential to achieving social justice. 29 Achieving PH goals requires strengthening of the autonomy of the public to enhance creativity and vitality as members of the community. 30 Therefore, we considered respect for all human beings, other species of life, the environment and subsequent generations, instead of relying solely on respect for individual autonomy; and, while emphasizing the protection of privacy and the confidentiality of information, focused on developing the capabilities, responsibility, and empowerment of individuals to choose healthy behaviors and participate in the community. At the heart of our framework, there are five steps to evaluate a PH plan in depth. Considering the consequentialist nature of PH, 2 in the first step of evaluation, focus is on the Table 3 e Procedural evaluation of the PH program.",

Marckmann et al., 13 believe that the first criterion is the expected benefits of the program; in the event of uncertainty about the expected benefits, the implementation of the program should be discontinued, and there is no need to evaluate other criteria. Reducing possible burdens and risks, and increasing effectiveness of the program is one of the main goals of ethical evaluation 11 that hasn't been appropriately addressed by Marckmann et al. Priory setting of healthcare services and allocation of resources is one of the important ethical issues in PH policy and requires the use of cost-value analysis, 27, 31 in addition to cost-effectiveness analysis. These formal analyses provide the systematic, quantitative, and comparative inputs of health interventions, which help us with ethical decision-making (with some limitations). 26 In the fourth step, fairness and equitable distribution was addressed by providing equal access to various population groups and paying special attention to vulnerable and disadvantaged groups. Fairness is a broad concept which includes 'equitable resource allocation, access to all types of care and financing, equity in health outcomes and accountability'. 19 Unlike other frameworks, the specific focus of this step is on the social determinants of health. Kass 11 has also noted the importance of social determinants of health, in addition to access and fair distribution of benefits and harms. In a stewardship model proposed by the Nuffield Council on Bioethics 2007, 15 reducing health inequalities has been mentioned as one of the ethical aims. Unlike the present study, Ten Have et al. 12 focused on avoiding stigma and discrimination. Marckmann et al. 13 mentioned the elimination of financial and non-financial barriers to access programs and emphasized the need for compensation, as we did in the present study.",

Healthy lifestyle is influenced by both individuals and social determinants, including structural factors and living conditions. 33 Therefore, in the fifth step, community empowerment and participation were focused on separately, while other frameworks suggested this issue only as the health-related empowerment 13 and informed choice 34 under the principle of respect for autonomy. While social justice, in addition to distributive and procedural justice, requires capacity building, fostering individual capabilities, and improving well-being dimensions at the level of adequacy, including reasoning and autonomy, to make the right decisions and informed choices. 29 The five steps of our framework consisted of five questions and sub-questions, which makes it very user-friendly. However, the frameworks proposed by Ten Have et al. and Marckmann et al. include eight and five general questions, respectively, on the morally relevant features of a program, without any sub-questions to help users apply it in practice. 12, 13 Regarding the establishment of global governance to address complex issues and the requirement of responding to a range of new ethical challenges, including conflicts of interest and governance issues, 8 the final step of our proposed framework includes evaluation of the fair procedures to ensure accountability, solidarity and public trust. In this step, we have examined the accountability items in detail, as well as the monitoring and evaluation items to ensure implementation of the ethical criteria in practice. The accountability framework was firstly proposed by Daniels and Sabine 17 in 1998, including the four conditions of 'publicity, relevancy, openness to appeals, and enforcement condition'; Marckmann et al. 13 subsequently added the three conditions of 'consistency, participation, and management of conflict of interests'.",
