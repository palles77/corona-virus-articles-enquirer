The most commonly studied migrant nationalities were Brazilian (36%), followed by Chinese (27%) and Filipino (8%). Thematic analysis of barriers to mental well-being among migrants chiefly identified 'language difficulties', 'being female' and 'lack of social support', whereas the primary facilitators were 'social networks' followed by 'cultural identity'. Policy recommendations for authorities generally described more migrant support services and cross-cultural awareness among the Japanese public. Conclusion Access to social support networks of various types appears to be an influential factor affecting the mental well-being of international migrants in Japan. More research is necessary on how to promote such connections to foster a more inclusive and multicultural Japanese society amid rapid demographic change.",

            "text": "Global migration has increased markedly in recent decades and international migrants, in 2016, constituted 3.4% of the global population. 1 International migrants are considered to be 'any person who lives temporarily or permanently in a country where he or she was not born, and has acquired some significant social ties to [their] new location'. 2 Therefore migrants include non-indigenous people who are long-term immigrants, organisational expatriates, international students and migrant workers as well as forced migrants such as asylum seekers and refugees. While motivated by push and pull factors based on perceptions of opportunity, international migration has been well documented to be a stressful and multi-factorial process that can adversely affect health. [2] [3] [4] The 'right to health' of migrants is enshrined in the Declaration of Alma-Ata (1978) and states receiving countries should take a comprehensive approach to healthcare of such sojourners beyond basic infectious disease control. 5 Accordingly, migration is increasingly recognised as a structural socio-economic force that influences health outcomes as a social determinant of health, in general, and mental health, in particular. 6 7 As the world's third largest economy, Japan was home to 2.2 million international migrants in October 2018. This figure represents about 2% of the national population and approximately 200 000 foreign nationals were newly settled during that year. 8 While the number of foreign residents settling in Japan continues Open access to accelerate, the total population of Japan is predicted to decline by 31% from a peak of 126 million in 2016 to 87 million by 2060. 9 This demographic shift is a harbinger of the future as Japan is only the first nation in human history to experience population decline due to 'superageing'. Other high-income nations like South Korea, Germany and Italy are on a similar demographic trajectories and such changes will likely increase the proportion of young foreign national populations. 10 However, unlike other high-income countries with a history of large-scale, institutional health research that includes non-citizens, 11 in Japan, mainly exploratory research has been conducted on the health of migrants.",

To the best of our knowledge, there has been no synthesis of the literature on the mental health or well-being of international migrants to Japan. This systematic review was conducted in order to examine the social determinants of mental well-being among migrants.

Exclusion criteria were: (1) conference proceedings, expert opinions, single case reports or reviews; (2) analysis of international tourists and (3) studies published prior to January 2000.

Figure 1 is a PRISMA flow diagram of our screening process. 15 Data extraction A review library of included studies was made of PDF files using Mendeley referencing software. Data were extracted independently into Excel by the primary researchers (RM, YT). Extracted data (online supplementary table  1) were first author, year of publication, study design, study area (city or region), subject nationality (<4 largest groups are specified), number of subjects, mental health variable assessed, epidemiological tool employed, significant barriers as well as facilitators of mental well-being and subsequent policy recommendations. Non-significant factors presented by the study authors were not included in the extraction. Strategies and data presentation were discussed by researchers throughout the process to harmonise search and extraction strategies.",

These criteria were as follows: consideration of premigration factors; consideration of postmigration factors; inclusion of a non-migrant comparison group; use of a valid measurement tool and justification of satisfactory sample size. A score of 1-5 were assigned to each study based on these criteria. Publications with scores 1-2 were labelled 'poor quality', 3 was considered 'average quality' and 4-5 were of 'good quality'. An experienced third reviewer was consulted (KICO) when assessing quality and potential publication bias.",

            "text": "In total, 55 studies examining the mental well-being of international migrants in Japan were selected for this review (for a detailed selection flowchart see figure 1 ). There were 13 studies examining international university students studying in Japan and one of Brazilian middle school students (the youngest cohort assessed in this study). [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] Eleven studies exclusively examined migrant workers [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] and four studies were on the mental wellbeing of economic partnership agreement care workers specifically. [37] [38] [39] [40] Two studies enrolled non-pregnant migrants 41 42 and eight exclusively analysed mothers. [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] The remaining nine studies were of general migrant populations of a single (n=5) or various (n=4) nationalities. [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] There were 10 studies specifically examining Brazilians of Japanese descent, making them the most studied nation-specific migrant subgrouping in terms of mental well-being. [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] In total, 8 649 migrants were surveyed. This calculation excludes >2 000 migrants reviewed in each of two systematic reviews. 44 46 All subjects were recruited from the community or retrospectively from clinical records. On average three studies per year (range, 1-5) were consistently published on this topic since 2000. Of the included studies, 23 were published in English while the remaining were in Japanese. Their study designs were cross-sectional (n=40; one in four using a comparative population), qualitative (n=7), case series (n=3), mixed methods (n=3) and systematic review (n=2). Most studies were conducted in specific major metropolitan areas, such as Tokyo, Osaka, Sapporo and so on. As study location was sometimes anonymised, it was inferred that almost all studies were completed within central Japan in an urban setting. The number of subjects per study ranged from 3 to 1,252, with a median size of 119. Importantly, a small number of migrants (<75) were explicitly not enrolled in a health insurance plan; the only studies that listed this variable were those of Nepalese 51 or Brazilians migrants. [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] Sample nationalities Of the migrants surveyed, 36% were Brazilian, 27% Chinese and 8% Filipino. Each nationality was exclusively studied in 14, 10 and 3 publications, respectively. The remaining 28 studies examined a mixed international migrant population. The four most numerous nationalities from each report were specifically extracted from a heterogeneous sample population, any remaining nationalities were identified as 'various' in online supplementary table 1.",

Ten studies concluded being female was a barrier to mental well-being; only one study suggested the female sex to be a facilitator of mental well-being. 29 This outlier assessed support-seeking behaviours among students, perhaps suggesting that while Open access female migrants to Japan experience more barriers to mental well-being, they are more likely to reach out for solutions than males; as has been shown previously in other immigrant populations. 71 Previous migration studies have noted that female migrants experience significantly poorer mental wellbeing than the indigenous population. 76 Additionally, several studies on Filipino, Brazilian and Muslim migrants established religiosity as a strong facilitator of mental well-being. 32 41 43 Cultural identity and religiosity as facilitators of mental wellbeing are consistent with previous research on cultural identity and religious beliefs among migrants. 77 Most of the studies surveyed in this review had general recommendations for the Japanese government, health authorities or society at large. As might be expected, the most discussed recommendation was the implementation of various support systems ranging from Japanese language education, medical systems and personal support networks. Such supports, like the provision of translated information and consultation desks, may address barriers for migrants; encouragingly local authorities have or are planning to implement many such mechanisms. 78 Notably absent from such government-backed systems, however, is support for a comprehensive medical interpretation system for healthcare institutions. 79 A more novel suggestion raised by fewer publications was the importance of transcultural education about diversity or appreciation of different cultural backgrounds. This may be due in part to generalisation on the part of mass media and a general lack of awareness among the domestic population as the Japanese the word imin, immigrant, is generally only applied to low-skilled workers. 80 More research about diversity education in Japan may help to address the social determinants of migrant mental health.",

            "text": "Robust sampling in migration research is understood to be difficult because migrant populations are inherently mobile and often prefer to remain unidentified. Thus, migrant research is chronically underfunded as research agencies are reluctant to award grants where rigorous methodology does not exist. 3 Most studies on migrant mental well-being in Japan were community-based and used convenience or snowball sampling. Unsurprisingly, study populations were small, as half of studies enrolled less than 119 participants and only one publication included explicit sample size calculations. 64 The study with by far the largest sample size, used government survey records from Hamamatsu, Ibaraki Prefecture, to study the social connectedness of 1252 Brazilians migrants. 65 There were also four retrospective surveys of institutional medical records over several years identified by our study. 27 52 54 60 Taking into account the difficulty of sampling, samples were viewed as often justifiable to measure specific communities but representative cross-sections of entire migrant populations. In contrast, in their systematic review of immigrant women in the perinatal period, Kita et al surveyed more than 10 studies with large samples sizes that reviewed Japanese medical or governmental records. 46 Improving the rigour in migrant health research in Japan will require more analyses of health records and secondary analysis of government administered surveys like the largescale surveys including migrants that are regularly carried out in the European Union. 81 Next, the representativeness of migrant sampling, in terms of proportionality to the foreign community in Japan, was found to be skewed. The most populous migrant populations represented in our study were Brazilian (37%), Chinese (27%), Filipino (8%) and Korean (4%). It seems that Brazilian migrants and students, particularly Chinese students, have received more research attention in Japan. In reality, according to the Ministry of Justice, the four most populous migrant nationalities as of 2018, in descending order, were Chinese (29%), Korean (18%), Vietnamese (10%) and Filipino (10%). 82 The Nepalese and Vietnamese populations in Japan have exploded since 2015, 8 and related research is only just appearing in the literature. Such research biases are remarkable and may carry across migrant studies in Japan and should be addressed for accurate scoping of migrant health. 83 Migrants to Japan are relatively understudied compared with migrants in other high-income countries, especially in terms of mental health status. While this may be due to their comparatively low proportion in Japan (whereas >12% in both Germany and UK), Japanese society is at a critical juncture with new visa categories launched in April 2019 dramatically increasing the number of foreign workers. 84 Key health policy documents, such as the WHO Japan Health System Review, discuss health equity in depth but still only mention migrant health in passing. 85 As it becomes clear that Japan perhaps needs international migrants perhaps more than the reverse, questions remain about whether Japanese social leaders are prepared to facilitate positive mental well-being to create a flourishing society together with migrants regardless of nationality and socioeconomic status.",

Most of the studies reviewed were cross-sectional and therefore could only describe correlation and not causation so the strength of actionable conclusions may be impacted. As a narrative approach was taken to data synthesis, all studies were given an equal weight regardless of size, level of significance and quality which could have given undue influence to the findings of four publications of lower quality. Heterogeneity testing or subgroup analysis of the surveyed literature was not done as part of a meta-analysis leaving the study qualitative in nature. Additionally, grey literature was not assessed, potentially leaving out valuable findings on this topic. The strengths of this systematic review are its comprehensive nature in terms of search strategy and data analysis as well as examining publications published in Japanese. In this way readers can better understand the diversity of the foreign resident population of Japan from the prospective of mental well-being.",

While promotion of such ties is appropriate, the importance of promoting diversity awareness among healthcare professionals and society-at-large may be under-appreciated. Taken together, our results show that the mental well-being of migrants in Japan requires more investigation about how to best support the integration of international migrants in Japan to actionable government policy.",
