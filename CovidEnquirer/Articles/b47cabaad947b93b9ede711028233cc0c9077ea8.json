[1] [2] [3] Viruses in the Picornaviridae family include enteroviruses (EV), 4 coxsakieviruses (CV), human rhinoviruses (HRV), 5 and poliovirus (PV); viruses in the Caliciviridae family include human noroviruses such as Norwalk virus (NV) and MD145, 2 and murine norovirus (MNV); and viruses in the Coronaviridae family include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 6 and human coronavirus 229E. These viruses can cause outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis (NV), 7 severe systemic disease with high mortality (SARS-CoV), 8, 9 or a severe form of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) 10 associated with fatal encephalitis, paralysis, and myocarditis (EV71). Despite great efforts made in the discovery of preventive and therapeutic measures for these viruses, 11 no antiviral drug or vaccine (except for poliovirus) is currently available. Viral 3Cpro and 3CLpro are cysteine proteases and share a typical chymotrypsin-like folding, a nucleophilic cysteine residue in the active site, and a preference for a glutamine or glutamic acid residue in the primary binding residue (P1 site) of the substrate proteins. 12 The 3Cpro or 3CLpro of these viruses are appealing targets for the discovery of antiviral therapeutics, and the conservation of the proteases may provide an excellent platform for broad-spectrum antivirals for those important viruses. 12 We report herein our design, synthesis, and bio-evaluation of a class of broadspectrum anti-viral tripeptidyl inhibitors as depicted in Figure 1 .",

Hence, a series of tripeptidyl molecules containing an aldehyde warhead of glutamine surrogate at P1, leucine at P2, and arylalanine at P3, such as 1-5, was first synthesized and evaluated.",
