            "text": "Introduction: Pulmonary infiltrates in immunosuppressed patients are common. Yields from bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) has been reported to be between 31 and 65%. The clinical impact of pneumocystis and viral Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing on BAL has not been extensively evaluated in a mixed immunosuppressed patient population. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of immunosuppressed adults with pulmonary infiltrates who underwent BAL at the University of Rochester Medical Center. Only one BAL per patient was included. We compared the rate of positive PCR testing to conventional testing. We then investigated factors associated with positive PCR testing. Finally, we assessed for changes in antimicrobial therapy after bronchoscopy. Results: Three hundred and fifty-nine patients underwent BAL with 249 patients having pneumocystis PCR testing and 142 having viral PCR testing. Pneumocystis identification occurred in 43 patients and viral species identification occurred in 56 patients. PCR testing increased pneumocystis identification compared to microscopy, 14% vs. 5%, p = 0.01, and viral identification compared to culture, 25% vs. 6%, p = 0.0001. Of the patients with positive pneumocystis PCR testing 49% had antibiotics stopped, 66% were started on anti-pneumocystis therapy, and only 6% did not receive treatment. There was no difference in the number of patients with antibiotics stopped based on viral PCR testing results. Discussion: PCR testing increases BAL yield in immunosuppressed patients compared to conventional testing. Pneumocystis identified by PCR only may cause a self-limited infection and may not require antimicrobial therapy. PCR testing should be included in the evaluation of pulmonary infiltrates in immunosuppressed patients.",

Positivity was determined based on reaching a certain DNA threshold and the number of replication cycles required. If positivity is reached prior to 40 replications cycles the sample was considered positive. If positivity is reached after 40 replication cycles the sample was considered negative. Fewer replication cycles (cycle time) needed until positivity suggest higher burden of starting organism, whereas higher replication cycles (cycle time) needed until positivity suggests lower burden of starting organism. Viruses were identified using multiplex PCR (FilmArray Biofire) which identifies: 15 viruses (adenovirus, coronavirus (4 strains), metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, influenza A (3 strains), influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza 1-4) and 3 atypical bacteria (Mycoplasma pneumonia, Chlamydophila pneumonia, and Bordetella pertussis). Pneumocystis jiroveci identification by microscopy consisted of Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver stain and Calcofluor white stain, and conventional identification of viruses utilized standard culture techniques.

Compared to BAL PCR testing noninvasive viral testing occurred less often, 62% of patients and pneumocystis testing occurred in 10% of patients. Multiple factors contributed to that including infectious concern, bronchoscopy setting, and timing of bronchoscopy. Multiplex PCR testing has the advantage of identifying viruses not easily cultured (i.e. coronavirus and metapneumovirus) and faster analysis compared to viral culture [12] [13] [14] 18] . Unlike pneumocystis PCR testing multiplex PCR cannot measure cycle time and determining viral burden is not possible. We recently observed discordance between nasopharyngeal and BAL samples, making BAL testing a reasonable option if clinical suspicion is high for viral infection despite negative noninvasive testing [18] . A delay in starting oseltamavir occurred in two patients because non-BAL testing did not occur. While non-BAL PCR testing can be helpful in making a diagnosis, it is less helpful excluding infections as 19% of patients with positive non-BAL PCR testing had multiple organisms identified on BAL.",

            "text": "Microscopy has identified pneumocystis primarily in the AIDS population [19] with PCR testing increasing pneumocystis identification in other immunosuppressed groups [11, 20] . PCR Positivity rates vary between 0 and 20% in non-BAL tested asymptomatic healthy adults [21] [22] [23] [24] and 14-68% in BAL tested samples from immunosuppressed adults with lower respiratory tract disease [20, 25, 26] . We found a 12-fold increase in pneumocystis identification using PCR in our other immunosuppressed group (connective tissues disease or solid organ transplant) and no change in our HIV/AIDS identification rate ( Table 3 ). The observed increase may be due to immunosuppressive therapies predisposing patients to infection with a lower burden of organism [27] , and may explain why microscopy is typically negative. The increase may also be due to a combination of the lack of specific prophylaxis recommendations in connective tissue disease treatment [28, 29] (only 9% of our patients in this group was on prophylaxis), the increased sensitivity of PCR testing, and the detection of reactivated latent [30] or self-limited pneumocystis infections. Based on our data PCR testing was equivalent to microscopy in diagnosing or excluding pneumocystis in HIV/AIDS patients. As a potential cost savings measure either test could be performed during BAL to diagnose or exclude pneumocystis in HIV/AIDS. Guidelines on using PCR to determine when treatment is necessary after detection of pneumocystis are currently lacking. Both Robert-Gangneux et al. (2014) and Maillet et al. (2014) found HIV/AIDS with pneumocystis pneumonia had lower PCR thresholds indicating a higher burden of organisms compared to non-HIV/AIDS patients they deemed colonized [20, 31] . We observed that HIV/AIDS and microscopy positivity had lower cycle time compared to non-HIV/AIDS and microscopy negative patients (Fig. 1) . We had six patients with PCR positivity only that had negative pneumocystis PCR testing on subsequent BAL testing. We would have expected persistent positivity if colonization occurred. We also had one patient with a cycle time difference of 13 when comparing non-BAL and BAL testing performed at the same time. This large difference makes using a single cycle time difficult in distinguishing when treatment is necessary. We think pneumocystis infection may occur on a spectrum, with high pneumocystis burden (low cycle time) requiring therapy while lower burden (high cycle time) being a self-limited process that may not requiring treatment. Compared to microscopy PCR testing is excellent at excluding disease as both Durand-Joly et al. (2005) [32] and our results found PCR testing to have 100% negative predictive value. (1,3)-Beta-D-Glucan testing calls into question the negative predictive value as we had four patients with positive testing and negative PCR testing. Sampling error could have contributed to these findings. Further studies are needed evaluating PCR cycle time in guiding treatment and comparing (1,3)-Beta-D-Glucan with negative PCR testing.",

Our study included two patients (5%) not treated, 11 patients (31%) treated with concomitant antibiotics along with anti-pneumocystis therapy (four with bacteria on BAL), and 17 patients (48.5%) had antibiotics stopped and treated with anti-pneumocystis therapy only after positive PCR testing. PCR testing led to the initiation of antipneumocystis therapy in 2/3 of patients after positive testing results returned. This approach limits potential toxicities [33] from empiric pneumocystis treatment. We do not think the treatment decisions made based on PCR testing affected morbidity or mortality. Importantly, in instances when BAL cannot be performed, pneumocystis therapy does not appear to decrease yield, as 28% of our patients were on pneumocystis anti-therapy prior to testing (1-4 days) and still had a positive PCR test.",

            "text": "There are limitations to this study. First, this was an observational study relying on data entered into the electronic medical record subject to data entry errors. Second, provider discretion influenced whether patients underwent bronchoscopy as not every patient with pulmonary infiltrates was evaluated with bronchoscopy. Third, some patients had multiple infections (pulmonary and non-pulmonary) and these other infections may have affected antimicrobial management. We could not routinely ascertain what type of infection was of greatest concern at the time of bronchoscopy. Lastly, management decisions post-bronchoscopy were often made by multiple different providers, adding to the variability in management. Further prospective evaluations are needed to better define infection rates with standardized microbiologic evaluation and the impact on management decisions. Pulmonary infiltrates in immunosuppressed patients are a common problem, with etiologies varying depending on of the degree and type of underlying immunosuppression. Guidelines are currently lacking on microbial evaluation based on type of immunosuppression and radiographic abnormality. PCR testing on BAL samples is increasing identification of infections that previously went undiagnosed through conventional testing and allows for tailored therapy based on results. Further studies are needed to help guide when non-BAL and BAL testing should be pursued. Until further studies are completed, thoughtful microbial evaluation by clinicians remains the strongest tool to interpret the significance of testing results. Based on our findings, we propose that pneumocystis and viral PCR testing (both noninvasive and invasive) should be included in the evaluation of all immunosuppressed patients with ground glass opacities on imaging. Furthermore we propose that patients with positive pneumocystis PCR testing may actually have self-limiting infection and that pneumocystis infections may exist as a spectrum of disease. Further studies of this hypothesis are needed. Combined with clinical suspicion PCR testing can be a helpful tool in the managing infection in immunosuppressed patients.",
