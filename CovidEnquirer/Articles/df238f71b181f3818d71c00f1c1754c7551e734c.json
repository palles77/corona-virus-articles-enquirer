The signal sequences of these glycoproteins are located internally in the primary translation product. We demonstrated that this did not interfere with translocation and glycosylation and yields biologically active proteins. The usefulness of sequences that direct internal initiation was extended by using EMCV UTR s to express two and three ORFs from polycistronic mRNAs.",

An MCS fragment was inserted downstream from the T7 promoter, yielding pTUG3, which was further modified to pTUG31 (Fig. 1A ). Sequence analysis of vectors of the pTU-series revealed that a number of nt were lost downstream from the T7 promoter. The sequences which are thought to form a stable stem-loop structure at the 5' end of T7 transcripts (Fuerst and Moss, 1989; Rosenberg et al., 1987) were still present ( Fig. 2A) . et al., 1983) .

Lysates of infected HeLa cells were prepared after metabolic labeling with L-[ 35S]methionine (Amersham Corp.) as described (Vennema et al., 1990) . Analysis by SDS-PAGE was carried out as described (Laemmli, 1970) . Typical results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 3 . The PGal protein was identified by co-electrophoresis of purified BGal (Boehringer, Mannheim) and CBB staining (Fig. 4) . Its identity was confirmed by RIPA using monoclonal antiserum against PGal (Promega, Madison, WI), followed by autoradiography (data not shown). Translation efficiency was determined by incorporation of [ 3sS]methionine. Liquid-scintillation counting of bands cut from stained gels of several experiments showed that 25-30% of the total radioactivity was incorporated into BGal using a construct containing UTR sequences. Using the standard hybrid/T7 system without UTR sequence incorporation into BGal was 3 % ofthe total. The improvement of expression due to UTR sequences was therefore eight-to tenfold. The level of expression was also compared to recombinant vSC (Vennema et al., 1991) which was constructed with the cloning vector pSCl1 (Chakrabarti et al., 1985) , with the 1uc.Z gene driven by the strong late VV pl I. In vSC-infected cells 6-7 % of the [ 3sS]methionine was incorporated into BGal. Production of BGal in the T7/UTR system was therefore approx. four times more efficient than that with vSC. Remarkably, incorporation into other proteins, presumably of VV, in vTNZ + vTF7-3-infected cells was 1.5 to twofold less than in the vTUZ + vTF7-3 and vTF7-3-infected cells. This reduction was not due to methionine limitation since it was also observed when normal medium was used for metabolic labeling, instead of methionine-free medium (Fig. 3C) . The same observation was made with another reporter gene (see section f). Among the affected proteins was the T7 RNA polymerase (indicated with an arrowhead).",

This can be explained by translation through internal initiation of transcripts starting at late VV promoters, located upstream from the IucZ gene in the recombinant genome. Late in infection transcription termination does not occur and therefore long transcripts are synthesized (Mahr and Roberts, 1984) which may span the reporter gene. The same phenomenon was observed with another reporter gene (see section f). To estimate total production levels the amount of accumulated /?Gal was compared to standard amounts of purified /?Gal in CBBstained gels (Fig. 4) . The PGal band was most prominent in lysates of vTNZ + vTF7-3-infected cells; in vSC-infected cells it had about the same intensity as the major VV bands. Comparison to purified /IGal showed that lo4 cells infected with vTNZ + vTF7-3 produced approx. 1 pg flGa1. The amount of /?Gal produced in pTNZ transfected and vTF7-3-infected cells was approximately the same as in vTNZ + vTF7-3-infected cells. In our hands the standard hybrid/T7 system gave approximately half the expression level of vSC. Using similar constructs the same ratio was reported (Falkner and Moss, 1990) indicating that the expression level with our construct in the standard hybrid/T7 system was no underestimate.",

The construct was designated pTFM*. The fusion product was encoded by the first live codons of the EMCV polyprotein-encoding gene and the A4 gene starting from the 12th codon.

To establish if several UTR sequences could be used to express more than one ORF, constructs were prepared encoding two or three different proteins (Fig. 7A) . The reporter genes, cloned into the appropriate vectors, encoded FIPV structural proteins, which were analyzed by RIPA using a polyvalent anti-FIPV serum. The results of infection-transfection experiments are shown in Fig. 7B . Lane 5 shows that the M and N genes were both expressed from pTFMN, at levels slightly below those of pTNFM and pTNFN (lanes 2 and 3, respectively). Cleavage of the signal sequence of the M protein was apparently affected by the presence of the N-terminal extension, which was long and highly charged in this case. During the p&se-labeling experiments an extended precursor was found (Fig. 7B) , indicating that the majo~ty of translation products was initiated at the EMCV polyprotein start site. After chase incubations the precursor was partly converted to the cleaved product (Fig. 6B) . Digestion with EndoH showed that both forms were glycosylated, indicating that the N-terminal extension did not affect translocation (Fig. 6B ). In view of the results with pTFM* (section g), we should consider the possibility that a transmembrane segment provided the translocation signal instead of the internalized N-terminal signal sequence. The signal sequence was cleaved correctly, albeit more slowly than for the wt protein. Construct pTFMNS, having UTR sequences upstream of the N and S genes, induced synthesis of the N and S proteins. Apparently, downstream UTR sequences had a deleterious effect on translation of the part of the mRNA for the M protein, which had no cap and no UTR, since the M protein was readily produced from a monocistronic T7 mRNA without UTR (Fig. 7B, lane 9) . Finally, pTFM*NS was prepared which efficiently expressed three genes. This plasmid consisted of the A4 gene of pTFM* combined with the N and S genes of pTFMNS, and contained UTR sequences upstream from three ORFs. The synthesis of the N and S proteins and the M* protein was driven by this construct (Fig. 7B, lane 8) .",

(1989) ; these investigators changed the EMCV translation start site to contain an NcoI restriction site. In their vector, pTM 1 (Moss et al., 1990) was reported that elimination of this start codon caused a decrease in expression (Moss et al., 1990 ). In our system the translation start site was not modified by mutagenesis but instead the highly efficient EMCV polyprotein start site was used. Internal binding apparently occurs directly at the translation start site of EMCV (Kaminski et al., 1990) . Therefore, changing the position of the start codon may diminish the enhancement achieved with the UTR. (2) Extensive comparison made between expression with and without UTR sequences showed that translation efficiency could be improved eight-to tenfold. Taking into account that 5-10% of the T7 transcripts are capped and translated in the standard hybrid system, the fraction of transcripts involved in translation approaches 100% using EMCV UTR sequences. We were not able to further enhance the expression level by treatment with hypertonic medium (unpublished data) in contrast to previous observations (Elroy-Stein et al., 1989) .",

This occurs by internal binding of ribosomes, Translation effkiency in the hybrid reVV/T7 RNA polymerase expression system was enhanced significantly by EMCV UTR sequences(Elroy-Stein et al., 1989).The aim of this study was to enhance the translation efficiency in the T7 expression system by EMCV UTR sereplaced by the SalI-EcoRI T7 cassette from pTUX, to yield pTUG I. The SmaI, KpnI, Sac1 and EcoRI sites of the pUC MCS were deleted by digestion with SmaI + EcoRI, and the XhoI-Sal1 MCS fragment from pUCX was inserted in the XhoI site, yielding pTUG3. A 170-bp HindIII-NurI fragment, containing the 1ac.Z a-peptide-coding region was deleted from the pUC part, resulting in pTUG3 1. (B) Cloning ofthe IacZ reporter gene. The IacZ gene, starting from the 9th codon was isolated from pSCl1 as a 3-kb BamHI fragment. The fragment was PolIk-tilled-in and ' end of the IacZ gene. The BumHI site in the MCS allowed excision of the 1acZ gene with a start codon. The BamHI fragment was recloned in pTUG31, yielding pTUZ. (C) Construction of UTR vectors.
