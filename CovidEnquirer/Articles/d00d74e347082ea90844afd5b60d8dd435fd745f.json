            "text": "Viruses play an important role in biological mechanisms by which nature maintains a balance among living organisms on earth. The role of viruses in controlling numbers of human beings is illustrated by the impact of variola viruses (smallpox) which killed an estimated 10-15 million people per year until as recently as 1967. Others include influenza viruses, which reduced numbers of humans by some 20 million during the 1918-1919 pandemic, and measles and hepatitis viruses. Eventually mankind rose above all other living organisms with intelligent and innovative resistance to biological mechanisms for controlling its proliferation at the cost of other lives on earth. The role of smallpox was finally eliminated in 1977 by eradication of the virus, and the impact of viruses like influenza, poliomyelitis and measles was restricted by vaccination. Today we have reached the point where man has severely disrupted the balance of living organisms on the planet. It is almost sad to note how nature keeps fighting a seemingly lost battle by bringing in reinforcements in the form of new viruses like the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and mutants of old stalwarts like influenzaviruses with new battle strategies.",

            "text": "Viruses affect all forms of life, from single cellular plants like bacteria and single cellular animals (protozoa), to the highest forms of plants and animals, including man. Remarkable features of virus-host relationships include the variety of mechanisms by which different viruses are transmitted from one host to the next. Some viruses are highly host specific, like HIV, while others are less host specific, like influenzaviruses. Different viruses are designed for specific modes of transmission. For instance, viruses such as HIV, rabies and haemorrhagic fever viruses, are designed for direct inoculation of contaminated body fluids from an infected host into the tissue or blood stream of a new host. Viruses like influenza and measles are designed for airborne transmission and inhalation of air containing the viruses by a new host. Then there is the large group of enteric viruses that primarily infect the intestinal tract and are typically transmitted by the faecal-oral route often involving the ingestion of food and water contaminated with the viruses. However, there are no rules and regulations cast in concrete. There are exceptions to all these principles, allowing viruses to exploit alternative options when it serves their best interest.",

Diarrhoea causes approximately 2.2 million deaths per year, mostly among children under the age of five, and while water is not solely responsible, water sanitation and hygiene are extremely important factors in this death toll (Pru\u00a8ss-\u00dc stu\u00a8n and Fewtrell, 2004) . The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that every year there are 1.7 million deaths related to unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene, mainly through infectious diarrhoea. Some 4 billion cases of diarrhoea annually account for over 82 million disability adjusted life years (DALYs), representing 5.7% of the global burden of disease and placing diarrhoeal diseases as the third highest cause of morbidity and sixth highest cause of mortality (Pru\u00a8ss and Havelaar, 2001) . In addition, waterborne disease is a major threat to millions who live in underdeveloped and informal conditions, or are displaced or otherwise affected by conflicts and disasters. Although the developing world is hardest hit by waterborne diseases, developed countries are also affected. For instance, the largest outbreak of a waterborne disease on record with some 403,000 cases of cryptosporidiosis occurred in 1993 in Milwaukee, a highly developed modern city in the USA (MacKenzie et al., 1994) .",

Undetected diarrhoeal illnesses are common but generally not severe; their significance is often unrecognised and many illnesses are unreported. The societal cost of the so-called ''mild gastrointestinal illnesses'' is several orders of magnitude higher than the costs associated with acute hospitalised cases. In the US, the annual cost to society of gastrointestinal infectious illnesses was estimated as $19,500 million dollars (1985 US dollars) for cases with no consultation by physician, $2750 million dollars for those with consultations, and only $760 million dollars for those requiring hospitalisation. From the data collected during the Canadian studies and based on reported symptoms in the US (population of 300 million individuals) the estimate of the cost of waterborne illness ranges from US$269 to 806 million for medical costs and US$40 to 107 million for absences from work. These figures illustrate the enormous economic costs of endemic gastrointestinal illnesses, even in societies where waterborne disease is not perceived to be a problem (Payment, 2006b ).",

In some cases different strains of a viral species, or even different species of a viral genus, may infect animals.

The hepatitis E virus may be the only meaningful exception to this rule, having strains which seem to infect both humans and certain animals, complying with the definition of a zoonosis (Grabow, 2002; Maluquer de Motes et al., 2004;  Chapter 3).

The 51 antigenic types of human adenoviruses (HAds) consist of a double-stranded DNA genome in a non-enveloped icosahedral capsid with diameter about 80 nm and unique fibres. HAds cause a wide range of infections with a spectrum of clinical manifestations in the gastrointestinal, respiratory and urinary tracts, as well as the eyes. Relevant examples include types 40 and 41, which are an important cause of childhood gastroenteritis, and types 3, 4 and 7 associated with pharyngo-conjunctival fever commonly known as ''swimming pool conjunctivitis''. HAds are excreted by infected individuals in high numbers (enteric HAds in numbers of 10 11 g \u00c01 of faeces) and occur in relatively large numbers in faecally polluted waters, often outnumbering cytopathogenic enteroviruses. They are relatively resistant to unfavourable conditions, notably ultraviolet light. Apart from types 40 and 41, most HAds are readily detectable by cell culture propagation. In view of these features they have been suggested as useful indicators for enteric viruses. The US EPA has included HAds in its drinking water Candidate Contaminant List (CCL) as a group of high-priority viruses for water research, together with the groups of entero-, rota-and caliciviruses.

            "text": "The family Caliciviridae contains the genera Norovirus (Norwalk-like viruses) and Sapovirus (Sapporo-like viruses), which typically infect humans (HuCVs), as well as two other genera associated with infections of a wide variety of animals including mammals, fish, reptiles and insects. HuCVs consist of a single-stranded RNA genome in a non-enveloped 35-40 nm diameter icosahedral capsid, which under optimal conditions displays 32 calicle-like (cup-like) structures on the surface. HuCVs are exceptionally difficult to detect. They do not even seem to infect available cell culture systems since no viral RNA is detectable in cell cultures exposed to the viruses. Much of the initial research on the viruses was, therefore, carried out in human volunteers. Today progress is accomplished by means of molecular techniques. Noroviruses (NoVs) may be excreted in numbers of 10 10 g \u00c01 of stool or more. They are highly infectious and the most common cause of gastroenteritis associated with water and food in all age groups. However, the most frequent routes of transmission are person-to-person contact and the inhalation of contaminated aerosols and dust particles, as well as airborne particles of vomitus. Although clinical symptoms typically including vomiting, abdominal cramps, headache and muscular pain are relatively mild and rarely last for more than 3 days, the socio-economic impact is enormous. HuCVs are notorious for outbreaks on cruise ships, at holiday resorts, hotels, schools and hospitals, causing interruptions with far-reaching implications. Only about 40% of infected cases present with diarrhoea. Since cases with vomiting in the absence of diarrhoea are common, the infection is also known as ''winter-vomiting disease'', even though there is no meaningful seasonal trend. The immune response is poor and immunological protection short-lived, many infections are sub-clinical, and reinfection of individuals by the same HuCV strain is common. Secondary spread occurs often. For further details see Graham et al. (1994) , Monroe et al. (2000) , Duizer et al. (2004) , Maunula et al. (2004) , WHO (2004) , Chan et al. (2006) , Chapter 2.",

Other species of the genus infect animals, for instance, the bovine (ECBO) group of enteroviruses. Enteroviruses are among the smallest known viruses and consist of a single-stranded RNA genome in a non-enveloped icosahedral capsid with a 20-30 nm diameter. Some members of the genus are readily detectable by CPE in cell cultures, notably polio-, coxsackie B-, echo-and enteroviruses. Members of the genus Enterovirus are among the most common causes of human infection, with an estimated 30 million infections per year in the USA. The viruses are associated with a broad spectrum of diseases ranging from mild febrile illness to myocarditis; meningoencephalitis; poliomyelitis; haemorrhagic conjunctivitis; herpangina; Bornholm disease; hand, foot and mouth disease; diabetes mellitus and neonatal multi-organ failure. Chronic infections are associated with conditions such as polymyositis, dilated cardiomyopathy and chronic fatigue syndrome. There is reason to believe that the health implications of enterovirus infections are not fully understood, particularly in terms of the longterm effects of chronic infections that are not readily evident from epidemiological data. Most infections, particularly in children, are asymptomatic, but still result in excretion of large numbers of the viruses that may cause clinical disease in others. Poliomyelitis, which caused severe mortality and suffering for a long time, has almost been eradicated by vaccination, but mutants of live vaccine strains are of concern. Since enteroviruses are excreted in large numbers by many people, they are detected in large numbers in raw and treated water supplies worldwide by techniques commonly used for water analysis. They tend to be outnumbered, at least at times, only by adenoviruses. In view of their common presence, resistance to treatment and disinfection processes, and easy detection of some members, they are widely used in water quality assessment, control and monitoring.",

From here HAV readily spreads via the blood stream to the liver where it may cause serious damage known as acute hepatitis with jaundice a typical clinical symptom. HAV is highly infectious and one of the best-known waterborne diseases with well-defined records of outbreaks and cases. As with many other picornaviruses, up to 90% of infected individuals, particularly children, display no clinical symptoms of infection, but they do excrete the virus, which may cause clinical disease in others. Although the mortality is generally less than 1%, recovery is a slow process that may keep patients incapacitated for 6 weeks or longer, which has substantial burden of disease implications. Immunity acquired by natural infection is typically lifelong, but not vaccinederived immunity, which may constitute risks for immunised individuals later in life.

After various efforts of classification over many years failed, the virus with one antigenic type only has eventually been classified into its own exclusive genus Hepevirus, in its own family Hepeviridae. HEV and HAV share many clinical and epidemiological features, to the extent that they were identified as different viruses only relatively recently. HEV causes acute hepatitis and typical waterborne outbreaks very much like HAV, but there are differences. For instance, the incubation period is longer for HEV. Particularly important is that HEV has a mortality rate of up to 25% in pregnant women. Although HEV seems to occur in most parts of the world at least in animals, clinical disease and outbreaks in humans tend to have a specific geographical distribution, with high incidence in developing countries of India, Pakistan, Mexico and some parts of Africa. As mentioned earlier, outbreaks with tens of thousands of cases are on record for these areas. HAV, on the other hand, causes unprecedented clinical disease in non-immune populations all over the world. Immunity derived by natural infection is lifelong. One of the unique features of HEV is that it appears to be the only known enteric virus that is a typical zoonosis. There seems to be meaningful evidence that the same strains of HEV infect both humans and at least certain animals, notably swine, cattle, goats and rodents. This unfortunately implies that some animals may serve as reservoir for HEV strains that infect humans. For further details see Grabow (2002) , WHO (2004) , Chapter 3.",

HRVs are not readily detectable by CPE in cell cultures.

For enteric adeno-, all entero-and astroviruses there is little if any meaningful evidence of waterborne transmission. Waterborne transmission of rotaviruses has been confirmed, but it is not a common route of transmission. Likewise, more than 30 years ago coxsackievirus infections have once been associated with bathing in polluted lake water, but water and food are not recognised as important vehicles for the transmission of these viruses. The same may apply to polyomaviruses excreted in urine, for which waterborne transmission has not yet been confirmed. Even noroviruses, the most common cause of waterborne disease, are not predominantly transmitted by water. The same applies to hepatitis A and E viruses. Virtually without exception viruses transmitted by the faecal-oral route are predominantly transmitted by routes other than food and water. The most important mechanisms involve personal contact and the transfer of viruses in droplets or the inhalation of viruses in aerosols or airborne particles. For instance, at the height of poliomyelitis epidemics some decades ago, swimming pools were closed not for fear of waterborne transmission of the viruses, but to restrict transmission among bathers by other routes. Likewise, to this day schools and related gatherings are closed at times of outbreaks to prevent the spread by personal contact of typical enteric viruses such as coxsackievirus A16 and enterovirus 71, the aetiological agents of hand, foot and mouth disease.",

            "text": "It is feared that new strains of influenzaviruses may cause pandemics similar to the one that killed some 20 million people in 1918-1919. For a number of reasons, the global impact may be much larger this time (Webster, 1994) . The mutation rate of influenzaviruses is exceptionally high because the single-strand RNA genome consists of eight segments that facilitates recombination among different strains (antigenic shift) in addition to point mutations (antigenic drift). Another important factor is that influenzaviruses have animal hosts, notably birds such as waterfowl and domestic chickens, and pigs, all of which occur in exceptionally large numbers in certain parts of the world. This promotes high-rate multiplication of influenzaviruses with abundant opportunities for mutations and recombinations among human and animal strains. Currently, concerns are that the highly virulent avian influenza A strain H5N1, which recently emerged, may undergo a mutation or recombination changing the host specificity to also infect humans. Human influenzaviruses replicate primarily in the respiratory tract, but avian strains primarily in the gastrointestinal tract of birds. This implies that the viruses are faecally excreted in large numbers into the water on which dense populations of waterfowl occur. Consequently it is feared that water may play an important role in the transmission of influenzaviruses among waterfowl and potentially also from waterfowl to humans. In assessment of the risks involved it should be taken into account that viruses excreted in faeces are not necessarily transmitted to meaningful extent by water as has been explained earlier. There is little information on the mode of transmission of influenzaviruses among waterfowl. Water may possibly not play a particularly important role in the transmission of influenzaviruses among waterfowl because the virus seems to spread equally rapid among birds with restricted exposure to faecally polluted water such as poultry in breading batteries and ostriches in high-density farming units. The most important route of transmission may be direct contact and inhalation of droplets or aerosols, as is the predominant route of influenzavirus transmission among humans.",

Since the virus resembles coronaviruses known to be part of the intestinal viral flora of many people, and it was detected in the stool of patients, an association with waterborne transmission was considered possible.

After ingestion the viruses infect the epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract of the monkey. These cells release replicated viruses into the blood stream of the monkey and via this route they reach central nervous cells in the brain and spinal cord. These cells are highly susceptible to infection by polioviruses. Replication of polioviruses in these cells causes a typical CPE, which results in readily detectable paralysis of the monkey. In addition, the damaged cells are clearly visible by microscopic analysis of brain and spinal cord autopsy specimens. Monkeys inoculated with test samples were observed daily over a few weeks for signs of paralysis. Those that displayed paralysis were sacrificed for microscopic analysis of brain and spinal cord specimens.",

This is illustrated by viruses that successfully infect cell cultures, replicate their nucleic acid and produce capsid components, but fail to assemble complete virions and produce a CPE. These viruses are readily detectable by confirming the presence of their nucleic acid using molecular techniques. However, some enteric viruses seem to even fail to infect cell cultures, which may be due to the absence of viral adsorption sites on the cells. This includes the large group of noroviruses. Since noroviruses are so difficult to detect, much of the early information on these viruses was derived from research in which human volunteers were used to detect the viruses by infection and clinical symptoms of disease (Graham et al., 1994) .",

These techniques are based on the detection of the nucleic acid of viruses by a diversity of procedures including gene probe hybridisation, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR). Important benefits of these techniques include the ability to detect any virus for which the nucleotide sequence of the nucleic acid is known. In addition, the techniques are highly specific and sensitive. Generally, they yield results in a shorter period of time than the isolation of viruses by cell culture propagation. Unfortunately, they also have shortcomings. Among these is the need for special procedures to distinguish between viable and non-viable viruses. Also, it is difficult to obtain quantitative data on the numbers of viruses detected by molecular techniques. The tests are relatively complicated and require well-trained staff and appropriate laboratory facilities. False positive results due to contamination of test specimens, and laboratory environments contaminated with amplicons of viral nucleic acid, are major risks. Research on the improvement and modification of molecular techniques is a high priority in many laboratories worldwide. Recent progress includes assessment of viability by RT-PCR detection of m-RNA (Ko et al., 2003) , and enumeration of viruses by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (Choi and Jiang, 2005; Fuhrman et al., 2005; Ko et al., 2005; Van Heerden et al., 2005b) .",

At least sometimes these incomplete multiplication cycles even go as far as the production of capsid components. Failure to complete multiplication cycles may be due to a number of factors. Among others, it is known that viral infection of host cells and multiplication in the in vitro conditions is less successful than under in vivo conditions in the natural host. Another important factor is that the transformed cell cultures generally used for laboratory work have lost a variety of their original features, including functions required by at least some viruses for normal multiplication (Grabow et al., 1992) . Apart from the detection of m-RNA mentioned earlier, confirmation of the viability of viruses detected by molecular techniques may be carried out by infecting cell cultures followed by molecular detection of the nucleic acid of viruses, which failed to produce a CPE. This offers a sensitive and highly specific procedure for the qualitative detection of viable viruses (Reynolds et al., 1997; Grabow et al., 1999 Grabow et al., , 2001 Fuhrman et al., 2005) .

This is largely because it would be impractical to include recommendations for the wide variety of pathogens that may be transmitted by water. Major considerations included cost, time of analysis, expertise and lack of suitable techniques. This applied in particular to viruses that required complicated and expensive techniques for detection, while many viruses of prime importance remained to be identified and characterised. In addition, not enough information was available on the wide spectrum of viruses involved to define meaningful and practical guidelines for routine quality monitoring. Some recommendations mention an unqualified and undefined ''absence of viruses'', which is basically meaningless because it is practically impossible, and unnecessary, to sterilize water supplies. Some of the recommendations are a little more specific and refer to enteroviruses or enteric viruses. In practice these terms referred to the small group of enteric viruses that cause a cytopathogenic effect in certain cell cultures, because that was the only practical virus detection technology available at the time. Tests for these viruses are basically restricted to an indicator function because very few of them are typically associated with waterborne diseases.",

The principles concerned also played a fundamental role in the establishment of a wide spectrum of water treatment and disinfection processes for preparing acceptably safe water supplies (see Chapter 6). Today, it is possible to even directly reclaim safe drinking water from wastewater. However, as expertise and technology for the detection of pathogens and waterborne diseases were refined, shortcomings in the above approach to the management of drinking water safety were disclosed. For instance, according to Payment et al. (1991) at least in certain situations as much as 35% of household infectious gastroenteritis may be caused by drinking water supplies which meet conventional quality specifications. Cases and outbreaks of waterborne disease associated with conventionally treated drinking water have been reported in many epidemiological studies (Hejkal et al., 1982; Zmirou et al., 1987; Bosch et al., 1991; MacKenzie et al., 1994; Payment et al., 1997; Payment, 2006b) . Shortcomings of widely accepted guidelines for the microbiological safety of drinking water are also confirmed by the detection of pathogens, notably viruses, in supplies that have been treated according to specifications and comply with limits for faecal indicator bacteria (Keswick et al., 1984; Payment et al., 1985; Rose et al., 1986; Regli et al., 1991; Moore et al., 1994; Grabow et al., 2001; Vivier et al., 2004) . For instance, in routine monitoring of drinking water supplies which complied with all specifications, enteroviruses were detected in 17%, adenoviruses in 4% and hepatitis A virus in 3% of 413 samples analysed over 2 years . All viruses detected were confirmed viable by replication of nucleic acid in cell cultures. There is sound reason to believe that these data, as in most other studies, represent an underestimate of the true number of viruses present. The routine monitoring included conventional tests for coliform bacteria and heterotrophic plate counts, as well as tests for somatic and F-RNA coliphages using presence-absence tests on 500 ml samples. By definition the detection of any viruses fail the widely accepted drinking water quality guidelines and specifications referred to earlier.",

This definition of an acceptable risk of infection has since been used worldwide at least as a guideline for drinking water quality. Another approach to the definition of an acceptable risk for drinking water has been defined by the WHO (2004) . This is based on the burden of disease constituted by a water supply, and a limit of 10-6 DALYs has been suggested. Risk assessment analyses carried out on data for viable viruses in drinking water supplies which complied with all requirements for treatment and disinfection reveal that these supplies exceeded the recommended level of acceptable risk of infection (Regli et al., 1991; Haas et al., 1993; Crabtree et al., 1997; Grabow et al., 2001; Van Heerden et al., 2005b) . Available data suggest that the number of drinking water supplies worldwide that comply with this level of an acceptable risk may be rather restricted . The same seems to apply to the virological quality of swimming pool water (Van Heerden et al., 2005a) and other water environments used for recreational purposes (Fuhrman et al., 2005) .",

Reasons are based on major differences in the composition, structure, size and resistance to unfavourable conditions including water treatment and disinfection processes. Other reasons for the absence of a direct correlation in numbers of viruses and faecal indicators include differences in excretion by the general population and infected individuals in terms of numbers, seasonal incidence, epidemics and geographic distribution (Grabow, 1996; Chapter 5) .

Also, the cycle of water reuse is getting shorter which results in a selection for organisms more resistant to treatment and disinfection processes, like viruses and protozoan parasites.

Combined inputs from experts all over the world led to the establishment of a Framework for Safe Drinking Water (WHO, 2004) based on the principles of HACCP (Hazard Assessment and Critical Control Points). Basically the strategy implies that the quality of water is controlled at a selected set of critical control points (CPs) in a multiple barrier drinking water treatment system. Typically, CPs are monitored by testing water quality using physico-chemical and microbiological parameters. However, other parameters may also be used, such as observational monitoring of livestock barriers and the integrity of groundwater sources. Raw water sources may be seen as the first barrier with its own set of control measures for quality protection. Final disinfection at a treatment plant is an important CP, but quality control commences throughout the distribution system. Risk assessment is used to define the quality of the final product, as well as the efficiency of each CP to accomplish the desired final quality.

This includes a need for more data to reliably and effectively monitor the removal and inactivation of viruses at CPs. Available information on the efficiency of a number of treatment processes with regard to viruses may be considered sufficient to initiate the implementation of water safety plans. However, more details are required to comply with the ultimate objectives (WHO, 2004) . For instance, many of the available data are based on research in which viruses were detected by CPE in cell cultures. As has been pointed out earlier, this does not take into account viruses that have been damaged to the extent that they fail to produce a CPE but remain viable and at least potentially infectious. Also, most of the tests were carried out by recovery procedures with restricted and poorly defined efficiency and detected by techniques with questionable reliability in many cases. Most of the data are restricted to readily detectable viruses such as poliovirus, which may indeed serve as reliable indicators for other viruses, but are themselves not associated with waterborne diseases to meaningful extent. Little information is available on viruses of primary importance such as caliciviruses. More accurate data on the behaviour and survival of viruses in treatment processes have to be compared to those of practical indicators in order to establish appropriate routine monitoring procedures for CPs. Definition of ultimate goals for water quality, from which the efficiency of CPs is calculated, requires assessment of risk of infection and burden of diseases at least for representative (model) viruses such as rota, coxsackie B or hepatitis A, on which meaningful data required for these estimates are available.",

It is recommended that each country should have its own realistic targets designed by national authorities that take into consideration variables such as relevance to local conditions including economic, environmental, social and cultural factors. Considerations would have to include public health priorities and burden of disease, as well as financial, technical and institutional resources, and possibly also factors such as susceptibility to infection of communities with compromised immune status due to undernourishment or AIDS. Accomplishing these objectives may not prove easy in a world where over more than 100 years practices and perceptions based on specifications for treatment, disinfection and end-point monitoring for coliforms, got cast in concrete. This seems to be confirmed by slow progress along these lines. The acceptable risk for drinking water of one infection per 10,000 consumers per year was recommended in the USA in 1989. In 2001, this same acceptable risk was accepted as a standard in The Netherlands (Netherlands, 2001) and there are indications that other countries may be moving into the same direction. However, as far as can be established, no country has yet accepted an alternative level of infection risk as an official guideline or standard for drinking water. Many countries, particularly in the developing world, may not find it easy to define their own health-based targets for drinking water based on a risk of infection or burden of disease as recommended. Reasons include lack of expertise and relevant information. It also seems unlikely that countries will readily accept a healthbased target that differs from that in countries such as the USA and The Netherlands because it would basically be a political decision with implications for the image of the country, which affects international relations, trade, tourism and many other aspects.",

WHO (2004) contains a useful summary of available data on the relative survival of bacteria, viruses and protozoa (cysts and oocysts) in selected water treatment and disinfection processes. The table clearly illustrates the difference in resistance of these groups of organisms to drinking water treatment and disinfection processes. Viruses are substantially more resistant than bacteria to disinfectants like chlorine, monochloramine, chlorine dioxide, ozone and ultravioet light, and are less readily removed by processes such as sand filtration and membrane filtration. The data for viruses in this summary refer predominantly to readily detectable viruses such as vaccine strains of poliovirus detected by CPE in cell cultures. Although polioviruses are recognised as exceptionally resistant and serve as sound indicators for the survival of other viruses, the data do not cover viruses damaged to the extent that they fail to produce a CPE in cell culture, but are still viable and at least potentially infectious, as discussed earlier. For further details see Chapter 6.",

            "text": "Pioneer Louis Pasteur said, ''It is characteristic of science and progress that they continually open new fields to our vision''. This is true today as much as it was at his time more than 100 years ago. Although in recent times, particularly since the 1940s, major progress has been made in knowledge about viruses in water, many questions remain unanswered. Among these are a better understanding and appreciation of the public health impact of viruses. This includes the potential health implications of latent infections of entero-and other viruses, long-term effects of viruses such as polyoma associated with cancer and the health effects of many viruses that have not yet been disclosed. The challenges are complex and increase in complexity with the emergence of new viruses and mutants of existing viruses, a process driven by factors such as escalating populations of humans and related animals. Examples include avian influenzaviruses and other respiratory agents like SARS, which are associated with water to an extent that remains to be clearly defined. At the same time, major progress is being made with new strategies for water-quality management. However, the optimisation and application in practice of approaches such as water safety plans based on HACCP principles with healthbased quality targets require more information on viruses. There is sound reason to believe that new tools for the detection of viruses such as molecular techniques, assessment of the health impact of viruses based on risk assessment and burden of diseases, and refined expertise on epidemiological surveillance and interpretation of results are due to ensure exciting progress in the future (Chapter 13).",
