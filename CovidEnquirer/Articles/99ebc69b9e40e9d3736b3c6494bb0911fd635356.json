The damaged tissue displays cardinal signs of inflammation and microvascular injury that, unless resolved, lead to long-term tissue damage with associated dysfunction. Current therapies are limited and are often associated with many side effects. Increasing evidence suggests that members of the formyl peptide receptor (FPR) family, in particular human FPR2/ALX, might have an important role in the pathophysiology of I/R injury. It was recently demonstrated that several peptides and non-peptidyl small-molecule compounds have antiinflammatory and pro-resolving properties via their action on members of the FPR family. Here I review this evidence and suggest that FPR ligands, particularly in the brain, could be novel and exciting anti-inflammatory therapeutics for the treatment of a variety of clinical conditions, including stroke.",

These diseases significantly contribute to the mortality rate and full recovery is unlikely, with the single most important factor being the degree of ischaemic damage at the time of the event. Ischaemia refers to a reduction in blood flow and reperfusion injury is associated with an initial blood-borne neutrophil infiltration, giving rise to an inflammatory response and finally resulting in tissue injury [1] [2] [3] .",

These factors mediate the inflammatory cascade, involving leukocyte rolling, adhesion and transendothelial migration [3, 4] (Figure 1 ). Numerous receptors modulate the host inflammatory response.

Other therapeutic approaches have been explored such as targeting of receptors implicated in regulating and resolving the inflammation associated with I/R. One such family of receptors is the G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) known as the formyl peptide receptors (FPRs), whose involvement in I/R injury has been demonstrated in a variety of different tissues, and thus ligands for FPRs might play a role in host defense.",

[14] used primary microglia cells to demonstrate expression of FPR1 and FPR2/ALX genes; on stimulation with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), these cells undergo FPR2/ALX-mediated activation, leading to the suggestion that the blood brain barrier (BBB), under normal conditions, protects microglial cells. When endotoxaemia occurs, however, microvessels form an incomplete BBB and LPS is able to stimulate microglial cells, which assume macrophage characteristics and thus play a role in the inflammatory process [16] . Increased inflammatory events, such as leukocyte rolling and adhesion, occur in the murine cerebral microcirculation after endotoxaemia (something not observed under normal conditions) and seem to be mediated by FPR2/ALX (Gavins et al., unpublished observations). The increase in inflammatory events such as leukocyte rolling and adhesion observed following endotoxaemia also occurs during stroke. The role of FPR2/ ALX in stroke is of great interest to my research team and the importance of this receptor as a potential therapeutic target is currently being investigated. The role of the FPRs in cerebral I/R is discussed in more detail later in this review.",

Several natural formylated peptides have been purified from bacterial supernatants and exhibit the ability to activate human leukocytes [17] . fMLP is a widely used agonist of the FPR family and binds to FPR1 with approximately 1000-fold higher affinity than FPR2/ALX (K d values in the picomolar to low nanomolar range), resulting in calcium mobilization and neutrophil activation [18] . Evidence suggests that FPR1 and FPR2/ALX activate the same signal response downstream of the receptor, resulting from activation produced by different ligands [11, 19] . FPR2/ALX is a low-affinity receptor for fMLP (K d 430 nM) [11, 20] that produces a chemotactic response at micromolar concentrations. (FPR3 has a K d value of $10 mM [21] ). LXA 4 also interacts with FPR2/ALX (K d $0.5 nM) [22, 23] , inhibiting the pro-inflammatory responses induced by both FPR2/ ALX ligands in neutrophils and non-FPR2/ALX ligands in epithelial cell lines [23] [24] [25] .

In 1998, Klein isolated many small peptide sequences that react with FPR1 and FPR2/ALX [30] , such as MMK-1 (LESIFRSLLFRVM), a potent FPR2/ALX-specific agonist [31] . Other synthetic peptides such as His-Phe-Tyr-Leu-Pro-Met-NH2 (HFYLPM) stimulate both monocytes and neutrophils via FPR2/ALX binding [32] . The peptide fragment of NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (MYFINILTL) is an agonist specific for FPR2/ALX. Other recent screening studies include a 152 GPCR screen that identified a novel 21-amino-acid peptide agonist of FPR2/ALX and FPR3 termed CGEN-855A (TIPMFVPESTSKLQKFTSWFMamide) [33] and a screen for unique non-peptide agonists of FPR1/FPR2/ALX [33] . These screens demonstrate that agonists of FPR1/FPR-ALX have wide chemical diversity and analysis of these and future agonists will enhance our knowledge of ligand-FPR interactions [34] . Both exogenous and endogenous ligands interact with the FPR family. One particular endogenous ligand that has been widely studied is the glucocorticoid-regulated protein annexin A1 (AnxA1), which counteracts leukocyte extravasation ( Figure 1 ) [35] [36] [37] . Using calcium binding assays and L-selectin shedding protocols, Walther et al. demonstrated that AnxA1 N-terminal-derived peptides act on human neutrophils through FPR1 [38] . It was then shown that AnxA1 peptides initiate chemotactic responses in human monocytes, desensitizing cells to subsequent stimulations [39] .",

In particular, targets activated by endogenous anti-inflammatory mediators could be used for drug discovery for both I/R and other disease states because they are likely to have fewer side effects and their application would be similar to mechanisms that the body uses to reject inflammation [60] . One particular endogenous ligand of interest is the 37-kDa protein AnxA1, whose involvement with the FPR family has been widely studied and which affords protection in a number of I/R models. Initially, cardioprotection by AnxA1 was observed in rat myocardial I/R injury [64] . It was not until 2001, however, that La et al. [53] investigated the mechanistic and molecular basis of AnxA1 action and demonstrated that the pharmacophore responsible for cardioprotection lies within amino acids 2-12, with correct alignment being crucial [53] . A clinical application was hypothesised on the basis of cardioprotection being retained by the AnxA1 Nterminal peptide Ac2-26 (also termed AnxA1 Ac2-26 ) when administered 60 min into reperfusion [53] . Boc2 administration demonstrated for the first time that FPRs are involved in the cardioprotective properties of AnxA1. Histology demonstrated that neutrophil influx into the Review Trends in Pharmacological Sciences Vol.31 No.6 myocardium induces AnxA1 expression, which was absent in sham and na\u00efve animals.",

Schematic of how the FPR agonist AnxA1 could reduce inflammation in the brain following I/R injury and exert neuroprotection. Neutrophils are activated after I/R injury. They roll, adhere and migrate into the tissue. AnxA1 is released from neutrophil cytosolic granules to the cell surface, where it interacts with FPRs in an autocrine or paracrine fashion. Administration of AnxA1 (or the N-terminal peptide Ac2-26) causes the leukocyte detachment from endothelial cells. Resident cells, such as microglia, are also activated by I/R injury and, like blood-borne cells, release a plethora of damaging mediators such as reactive oxygen species, cytokines (TNF-a, IL-1b) and leukotrienes. The involvement of AnxA1 in these processes might be similar to that observed in the peripheral microvasculature, namely to promote resolution. The receptors that mediate this process in stroke remain unknown, although evidence suggests that FPR/ALX plays a role.",

The actual contribution of resident cells versus blood-borne cells has yet to be fully quantified and might explain why clinical trials targeting one specific aspect of the inflammatory cascade have failed. A neuroprotective role for AnxA1, mediated via FPRs, has been demonstrated in studies using a middle cerebral artery occlusion model combined with IVM to quantify cerebral cellular interactions following stroke [54] . Peptide AnxA1 Ac2-26 decreased infarct volume, leukocyte adhesion and markers of inflammation. Microglia might, in part, contribute to these inflammatory responses [54] . Both blood cells and microglia express mouse Fpr2, which might have mediated the effects of peptide AnxA1 Ac2-26 in this study. Further studies are being performed to validate this theory, with current data suggesting that microglial cell inhibition reduces brain inflammation post-I/R (Gavins and Perretti, unpublished data). Figure 2 demonstrates how AnxA1 could act in an autocrine and/or paracrine fashion with the members of the FPR family to reduce inflammation by (i) causing detachment of leukocytes within the microvasculature and (ii) inhibiting the production of cytotoxic proinflammatory mediators by activated microglial cells, both of which are thought to play a role in cerebrovascular events such as stroke [54] .",
