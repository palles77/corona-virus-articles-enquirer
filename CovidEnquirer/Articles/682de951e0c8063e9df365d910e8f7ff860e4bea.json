            "text": "Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) is now the most common acquired gastrointestinal emergency in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The initial clinical manifestations may be indistinguishable from other neonatal infections and NEC is suspected when gastrointestinal signs predominate. These include abdominal distension and tenderness, retention of feeds with ileus, blood in the stool, peritonitis and bowel perforation. Pneumatosis intestinalis (intramural gas) or intrahepatic venous gas are radiological hallmarks of NEC which some authorities (Kliegman & Fanaroff, 1984) require to confirm the diagnosis. In the absence of intramural gas (14% of cases) histopathological examination of tissue collected at the time of surgery or postmortem is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Necrotising enterocolitis usually affects the terminal ileum and ascending colon although in severe cases the whole bowel may be involved.",

            "text": "It appears that NEC is a disease with multiple causes and multiple contributory factors. Unknown factors alter the gut mucosa directly or indirectly and thus alter the defence mechanism of the gut against infectious agents. If the gut mucosa is damaged feeds are not well tolerated and gas produced by intestinal bacteria may pass through the friable mucosa to become lodged in the submucosa. The friable mucosa also facilitates the absorption of intestinal organisms and/or their toxins leading to further local damage, peritonitis and bacteraemia. The primary event in the pathogenesis of NEC is generally thought to be an ischaemic insult to the intestine with resulting localized hypoxia. A number of events may lead to ischaemia or hypoxia in the newborn baby especially if pre-term. In addition to intrauterine distress, birth asphyxia, respiratory distress and local trauma resulting from aggressive neonatal care, Lloyd (1969) suggested that newborn babies may exhibit the diving reflex shown by certain mammals in which, during an hypoxic episode, cerebral perfusion is protected at the expense of less vital organs, such as the gut. Experiments by Touloukian et al. (1972) and Alward et al. (1978) Barlow et al. (1974) provoked bloody diarrhoea in rats subjected to profound asphyxia. While many events in the early life of a premature neonate may result in periods of hypoxia or intestinal ischaemia none of the controlled trials have reported an increased incidence of hypoxia among babies who went on to develop NEC (Frantz et al., 1975 , Kliegman et al., 1982 .",

Patients with confirmatory or severe signs and symptoms of NEC were classified as stages II and I II. (19783) . Although a condition indistinguishable from NEC has been recognized for more than 150 years it is generally believed that the incidence has increased with the advent of modern neonatal intensive care (Lawrence et al., 1982) . NEC predominantly affects premature neonates in intensive care units. There is widespread variation in incidence between and within units. Variation within a unit is due to periodic clusters of cases superimposed upon less frequent endemic cases. The incidence of NEC in the UK is not known, but in the USA the overall incidence among premature babies is quoted as l-2% increasing to 5% during local outbreaks (Kliegman & Fanaroff, 1981; Brown & Sweet, 1982) and it has been estimated that 200@4000 newborn infants per year develop NEC (Wilson et al., 1981; Brown & Sweet, 1982) . The incidence increases markedly with increasing prematurity and may reach 12% if premature infants who survive until enteric feeds are begun are included. More mature babies are not immune to NEC and 10% cases occur among term neonates (Polin et al., 1976; Kliegman & Fanaroff, 1981) . Prior to the development of symptoms 90-95% NEC patients have received human milk or formula feed. In the study by Krousoup (1980) only 3% of 298 NEC patients developed symptoms before their first feed. Intramural gas is not a feature of those cases which develop before the introduction of milk feeds. Early suggestions that human milk protects the infant from NEC have not been borne out by subsequent investigation.",

            "text": "Considerable effort has been made to establish the nature of the initial insult which damages the intestinal mucosa and therefore predisposes a baby to NEC. Fetal hypoxic stress, birth asphyxia, respiratory distress, umbilical arterial catheterisation, overfeeding, exchange transfusions, congenital heart disease, liberation of plasticisers from intravenous equipment, hyperviscosity and specific bacterial and viral pathogens have all been considered. Lake & Walker (1977) proposed that these factors operated by increasing the mucosal permeability of the gut to pathogenic bacteria or their toxins and in early uncontrolled studies many of these factors were implicated in the aetiology of NEC. Subsequent controlled investigations failed to demonstrate any association between NEC and the various high risk factors which had been suggested nor were any differences recognized between NEC babies and other NICU babies matched for gestational age, birthweight and duration of stay in the NICU (Ryder et al., 1980; Stoll et al., 1980; Kliegman et al., 1982; Yu et al., 1984) . There still remains no satisfactory unifying explanation for NEC. The early outbreaks of NEC and the way in which cases clustered lead to the obvious conclusion that NEC represented another manifestation of neonatal sepsis (Kliegman, 1979) . The known association between Clostridium di.ciZe and pseudomembranous colitis in adults and the finding of this organism in the faeces of neonates suffering from NEC lead to serious consideration that this species of Clostridium or clostridia in general might be responsible for NEC. Early workers specifically implicated C. perfringens (Kleigman et al., 1979) , C. butyricum (Howard et al., 1977) and C. dificile (Cashore et al., 1981) in the pathogenesis of NEC. Subsequently it has been shown that these organisms are part of the normal neonatal gut flora (Smith et al., 1980; Richardson et al., 1983; Westra-Meijer et al., 1983; Bolton et al., al., 1984) . Attempts to implicate clostridial toxin in the pathogenesis of NEC have been equally unrewarding.",

Thomas et al. (1984) sought unsuccessfully to show that the concentration of toxin was higher in the faeces of babies with NEC than in asymptomatic controls. They concluded that C. dificile was unlikely to be involved in the pathogenesis of NEC. These workers failed also to demonstrate the alphatoxin of C. perfringens in the faeces of 33 babies with NEC, however, for various reasons were this toxin produced locally at the site of a necrotic lesion it may not be detectable in faeces. Viruses (Chany et al., 1982; Mogilner et al., 1983; Rotbart et al., 1983 ) and coliforms also have been implicated in outbreaks of NEC, but the evidence is unconvincing. Studies by Frantz et al. (1975); Bell et al. (1978a) and Westra-Meijer et al. (1983) suggest the possibility that the isolation of KZebsieZZa spp. from the faeces of premature neonates may be more closely related to NEC than the isolation of clostridia. These authors all report significantly higher isolation rates for Klebsiella spp. in NEC patients than in control groups (P values ranging from 0.005 -O-03). Bell et al. (1979) also examined the bowel flora of neonates in relation to the incidence of NEC. They noted a direct relationship between the incidence of NEC and colonisation rates for Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli from the stomach and faeces of babies. They concluded that the variation in incidence of NEC correlates with the predominant bacterial flora in the NICU concerned. Stanley et al., (1977) also reported a decrease in the incidence of NEC coincident with a change in the dominant faecal flora, Klebsiella spp. being replaced by Serratia spp.",

This suggests that the bacteria cultured from clinical cases of NEC might not actually be those that initiate the disease. In contrast to these findings, when healthy control neonatal animals with a normal gut flora were contaminated with Staph. aureus etc. they showed no ill effects. Neither did adult animals who, having first been rendered germ free, were then contaminated with a pure culture of an enteritis producing bacterium. Lawrence et al. (1982) suggest that neonates in the highly protected environment of a NICU may be in a similar situation to the germ free animal and that heavy colonization of the neonatal gut with one of a number of bacterial strains may lead to gut damage. The development of NEC in babies recently removed from the NICU because of good clinical progress (St011 et al., 1980) may be considered analagous to the removal of the germ free animal from its isolator.",

They suggest that because of the isolation and clinical cleanliness of the unit premature babies are colonized with fewer strains of bacteria. The risk of monocolonization is high and if the organisms involved are toxin producers then the toxic products of bacterial growth can be absorbed through the immature gut wall and lead to intestinal damage-the start of NEC. The widespread use of antibiotics in NICU's may further reduce the range of bacteria with which premature babies may become colonized. In contrast to this situation healthy babies are rapidly colonized by a succession of micro-organisms from their mother and the environment.",

In contrast in two other hospitals where neonatal care was less aggressive there was only one case of NEC during the same 3-year period.
