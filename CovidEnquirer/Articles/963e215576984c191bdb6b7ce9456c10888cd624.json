            "text": "There is worldwide concern about an imminent influenza pandemic. In this event, affected patients will back up in emergency departments (EDs) 1 and ambulances, 2 placing their staff at increased risk of infection. These considerations highlight the importance of transmission prevention strategies in the protection of ambulance and ED personnel. Currently, their personal protective devices include gloves, gowns, shoe covers, appropriate filter masks, and positive-pressure isolation hoods. 3 These barriers are sometimes ineffective because they are overwhelmed by prolonged exposure and large viral loads 4 or because they are not used properly, in time, or at all. [5] [6] [7] Reducing the shedding of infectious particles from contagious patients may provide additional protection for ambulance or ED personnel. Although it is commonly recommended that surgical masks be used on potentially infectious patients during periods of patient triage or transportation, it is readily acknowledged that such masks do not provide full protection from infection transmission. 3 Standard N95 masks may be more effective in containing potentially infectious particles but will not be suitable for most influenza patients ill enough to seek medical care, because these patients will require oxygen (O 2 ) therapy. O 2 therapy is commonly administered with the nonrebreathing O 2 mask, which is not designed to contain any respiratory droplets. In fact, these masks may actually increase the dispersal of respiratory droplets by jetting them through the mask's open side vents. 8, 9 Somogyi et al 8 reported that the use of the Hi-Ox 80 mask, which is designed specifically to deliver high fractional inspired O 2 concentrations (FIO 2 ), can provide respiratory isolation if a bacterial-viral filter is placed on its outlet port. However, the mask is expensive, unfamiliar to many, and not likely to be widely available in numbers sufficient for use as a first-line O 2 mask in the case of a pandemic.",

Our approach in designing such a mask was to add a nonrebreathing O 2 manifold to the familiar N95 mask, which provides excellent viral and bacterial filtration and is already widely distributed. We tested the effectiveness of this \"N95 O 2 mask\" in providing supplemental O 2 and compared it to the nonrebreathing mask and to the Hi-Ox 80 mask. We then tested the effectiveness of the N95 O 2 mask in protecting the wearer from microparticles in the environment and compared it to the criterion standard in this regard, the N95 mask. We also tested how well the N95 and the N95 O 2 masks retained microparticles originating from inside the mask. Finally, although the nonrebreathing mask is not designed to provide respiratory protection or isolation, we included it in particle testing because it is common, at least in our institutions, to find health care workers who believe it confers some level of protection to the wearer or the health care provider.",

In phase 3, we tested the masks' isolation function (ie, the effectiveness of each mask in containing microparticles generated inside the mask). We did not include the Hi-Ox 80 in particle testing, because its protective and isolation function would be that of the particular filter placed on its expiratory port, and this information is already well documented (eg, see Dellamonica et al 10 ) .

The manifold consisted of a 1-way valve, an O 2 inlet port, and an O 2 reservoir ( Figure 1 ). The Hi-Ox 80 mask was modified by placing a bacterial-viral filter (DAR Sterivent Mini; Mallinckrodt DAR, Mirandola, Italy) on its expiratory port. 8 Subjects were fitted with the Hi-Ox 80 and initially asked to breathe normally (resting condition). An O 2 flow of 2, 4, or 8 L/minute was selected randomly by draw. We chose these O 2 flow rates for 2 reasons. First, the Hi-Ox 80 is rated to provide clinically useful FIO 2 at these flows. 11 Second, using lower flows with O 2 masks may be necessary in case O 2 supplies become limited, as when treating mass casualties (eg, during a pandemic). Subjects were not told of the O 2 flow being administered. Once end-tidal PCO 2 (PETCO 2 ) and end-tidal PO 2 (PETO 2 ) reached a steady state (defined as less than a 2 mm Hg change in PETCO 2 during 2 minutes), minute ventilation, PETCO 2 , and PETO 2 were recorded for 2 minutes. Subjects were then asked to increase their minute ventilation sufficiently to reduce their PETCO 2 by 10 mm Hg below their resting values (hyperventilation) and maintain that level of PETCO 2 . Once steady state was achieved at the target PETCO 2 , minute ventilation, PETCO 2 , and PETO 2 were again recorded for 2 minutes. Subjects then reestablished steady-state resting ventilation, after which the test was repeated for the other 2 O 2 flow rates. After testing the Hi-Ox 80 at all 3 flow rates, the other 2 masks were tested (in random order) using the same protocol. The Hi-Ox 80 mask was tested first because it is the only mask that permits measurement of minute ventilation. We were then able to use the PETCO 2 to match the minute ventilation when testing the other masks.",

Six of the subjects were hospital employees who had been previously fit-tested with N95 masks. We therefore used the same model of N95 mask for their tests. The remaining 4 subjects who were not previously fit-tested were arbitrarily supplied with the 3M model 1870. Although there is a possibility this may have introduced variability in our data, the arbitrary use of masks simulates cases in which this mask would be applied to a patient as an infectious barrier. Each mask was prepared in advance by inserting a gas sampling port into the mask material ( Figure 2 ). The particle generator was turned on and infused microparticles freely into the closed room for 20 minutes before subject testing to increase the atmospheric particle concentration in the room to more than 200/cm 3 . The test mask was placed on the subject's face, and subjects were instructed to breathe normally. After at least 2 minutes, we recorded particle concentrations outside the mask and then from inside the mask for 30 seconds each.",

            "text": "Because no controlled studies outlining the full mechanisms of person-to-person transmission of influenza have been published, 16 we must make certain inferences from animal studies and observational and inoculation studies in humans. It appears that influenza is transmitted by droplets (\u03fe10 m), aerosolized droplet nuclei (\u03fd10 m), and by direct and indirect contact (see Bridges et al 16 and Salgado et al 17 for reviews). During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks, it was assumed that reducing the dispersal of respiratory droplets from infected patients would help control the spread of infection. To this end, the World Health Organization guidelines state: \"suspected cases should wear surgical masks until SARS is excluded.\" 3 Health Canada guidelines similarly recommend that a surgical mask be placed on the patient \"until SARS is excluded or the patient is admitted into the room.\" 18 However, it is also recognized that a surgical mask \"does not provide adequate respiratory protection to the wearer [ie, health care worker] if the infection is airborne.\" Recent studies in vitro have demonstrated that surgical masks can allow the penetration of more than 80% of virions 27.5 nm in diameter 15 -besides those that escape from the gaps in the mask seal to the face. The same would obviously apply to the isolation function of a surgical mask when worn by a contagious patient. Although quarantine of the patient may be effective in limiting contacts, it does not reduce the infectious load on those who enter the room and approach the patient or who participate in direct patient care. 19 When O 2 is administered to a patient, respiratory isolation is even more problematic. Our study confirms earlier work demonstrating that standard O 2 masks do not provide effective containment of droplet or nuclei-sized particles and, furthermore, may even contribute to the pattern and extent of spread. 8, 9 These considerations would be of greatest concern to such front-line health care workers as emergency medical services (EMS) and ED personnel who are required to attend symptomatic patients before any definitive diagnosis is made. The intensity of exposure is increased for these personnel for 2 reasons. First, they may have to provide high-risk interventions such as O 2 administration 9 and endotracheal intubation. 6 Second, the duration of exposure will likely be prolonged because filling of inpatient and critical care areas will result in Table E1 (available online at http://www.annemergmed.com).",

Indeed, increased airflow resistance and the perception of increased work of breathing were commonly experienced by health care workers after prolonged N95 mask use during the SARS outbreak in Toronto. The increased resistance to breathing is likely due to moisture obstructing the pores in the mask material. Increased breathing resistance would reduce the ability of breathless patients to tolerate long-term use of the N95 mask. Although no detailed studies evaluating the duration of effectiveness of the N95 mask have been done, 21 these considerations indicate that the N95 O 2 mask may be best suited for short-term use, such as during ambulance transport, hospital triage, and transport from one hospital ward to another (eg from the patient room to the diagnostic imaging department). On the other hand, the inspiratory flow resistance may actually be less than that of the original N95 because the N95 O 2 mask includes an O 2 reservoir that provides the major part of the inspiratory volume, leaving only small volumes at low flows at end inspiration to be inhaled through the mask filter material.",

Furthermore, the modification of the N95 mask for O 2 delivery retains the same filtration function as the N95 mask. This is the first study to confirm that the N95 mask, as well as our modified version of the mask, is effective in retaining microparticles originating inside the mask in vivo. Assuming that the kinetics of microparticle distribution studied in humans is a suitable model to study the risk of transfer of infection in humans, we conclude that for O 2 -requiring patients, the N95 O 2 mask appears to provide protection and isolation performance equivalent to that of the N95 mask, whereas the nonrebreathing mask would provide none at all. Additional clinical studies are needed to confirm that O 2 administration through this N95 O 2 mask is well tolerated by patients and that its use actually reduces the risk of disease transmission from infectious patients to health care workers. NRM, Nonrebreathing mask. *The protection function of each mask was quantified by measuring the concentrations of particles inside the mask and expressing each discrete measurement as a percentage of average external concentrations. *The isolation function of each mask was quantified by measuring the external particle concentrations while infusing particles into the mask and expressing each discrete measurement as a percentage of change from the average background concentrations.
