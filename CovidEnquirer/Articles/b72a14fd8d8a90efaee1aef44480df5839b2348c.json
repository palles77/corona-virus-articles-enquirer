            "text": "Interactions between medications administered to a patient contribute to concomitant morbi-mortality and, in many cases, could be preventable. A study carried out in Denmark upon 26 337 patients with at least 2 prescribed medications detected 21 293 different combinations, of which 4.4% carried a risk of producing a severe interaction. In this same study, 1.2% of hospitalisations were related to medicinal interactions. 1 In Spain, the APEAS study 2 found that 47.8% of adverse events detected in the primary health care field were due to medications, of which 3.5% were a consequence of medicinal interaction. Another published study reveals that 9.9% of the population over 65 years of age is at risk of clinically significant interactions. The study notes that there is an exponential growth in the risk of interactions being produced with a higher number of medications. 4, 6 Polymedication could therefore present a risk of interaction. In Australia 14% of the general population uses more than 4 medications, and in the population over 75 years of age this figure increases to 40%. Data from the UK indicates that 30% of the population over 75 years takes more than 4 medicines. In Spain, a study carried out in a rural area with basic health care indicated that 11.37% of the population was over 65, with an ageing population of 65% and an average prescription rate of 4 medications, and a greater number of prescribed medicines tallying with increased age. 7 However, management of medicinal interactions in clinical consultation is not easy. The introduction of new technologies PALABRAS CLAVE Interacciones medicamentosas; Bases de datos; Evaluaci\u00f3n de calidad in primary health care and hospitals has brought a development in the form of computerised clinical history, which has opened up the possibility of incorporating decision support systems (DSS) with regard to interactions, which alert the user at the moment of prescribing medicines and report on possible courses of action. However, the introduction of these systems is not yet widespread. According to an investigation carried out in Spain in 2007, computer-assisted prescription is in place in only 22.4% of hospitals. 8 In primary health care, the development of electronic prescription has not apparently been accompanied (thus far) by tools for the clinical management of interactions. However, many have incorporated complete databases in consultation format, in order that the clinic may utilise them at their discretion and in specific cases.",

And it is here where the range in databases and sources of information regarding interaction is such that it usually becomes impossible to manage physically. Furthermore, in a study carried out on just 5 databases, 9 it was found that the quality was very unevenly spread and the concordance was scarce, making it difficult to pinpoint real clinical importance in each of the interactions. 10 The objective of this study is to assess the structural quality of various drug interaction databases (DID) in order to be able to subsequently create a decision support system.",

Although not global in character, these can be considered a reference for the vast Latin American territories. Given that the majority of these were recovered from the grey literature, it is logical to assume that there should be a similar pattern in other languages; in other words, there are databases in any given language which are not referred to in scientific articles and, therefore, they are difficult for researchers of other languages to find. 21 Along with the issue of language, the question of which drugs are included is also pertinent, not just due to their quantity but also their relevance. In other words, those DIDs which include all medications from a specific market (eg, Bot-Plus or Medinteract, which include all medicines registered in Spain), can be of more use in that particular market compared with other databases which may have more medicines listed yet exclude some which are commercialised in that country.",

However, when evaluating the possibility of incorporating a DID into educative programmes, electronic prescription systems or a clinical task, it is possible that certainty, clinical significance and help with decision-making are more relevant. certainty makes reference to the fact that in a medical setting based on evidence, the interaction should have sufficient bibliographical references and the DID authors have classified the interactions according to some scale portraying level of evidence, as is seen in Drug Interaction Facts. The relevance assumes that some scale of severity is used, as can be found in Medinteract or Lexi. The abundance of medicinal interactions leads to, in some clinical practice environments, the need to prioritise attention towards those which are most severe. Particularly with computerised systems, it is necessary to obtain a \"good\" interaction signal or noise, for which criteria of severity is essential. 25 Lastly, knowledge of medicinal interaction is especially important if clinical action is to take place in order to prevent its occurrence. For this reason is seems essential for authors that the DIDs include a concrete description of the clinical management of a patient suffering with the relevant interaction, as can be found in, for example, Lexi or Micromedex.",

Each DID has its own protocol, as can be seen with Drug Interaction Facts or Hansten, which depends particularly on the severity and scientific evidence of the interaction in question. Recently a study was published which attempted to create a procedure for establishing the clinical significance of interactions. 26 However, the proposal has certain significant problems, such as not accounting for the idiosyncrasy of the patient, not being validated by studies on concrete groups of medicines, and proposing a final ranking based on severity and documentation. Although this is reasonable, the 2 categories require prior definition. All of this makes difficult the task of creating a standardised procedure for establishing clinical significance. 27 The wide range of information sources regarding existing medicinal interactions poses a major problem to professionals when compiling and evaluating information regarding a specific interaction coming from a specific source. We therefore consider that this study provides information which could be of interest for the practice of health professionals.",
