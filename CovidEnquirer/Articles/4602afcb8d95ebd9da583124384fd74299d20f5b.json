Trypsin and the respective protease 11 without SPINT2 incubation were used as controls. Cleavage of HA0 was analyzed via Western Blot and the 12 signal intensities of the HA1 bands were quantified using the control sample without SPINT2 incubation as 13 a reference point to illustrate the relative cleavage of HA with and without inhibitor (Figure 2A and B-D) . 14 Trypsin cleaved all tested HA proteins with very high efficiency that was not observed with matriptase or 15 KLK5 ( Figure 2B -D). However, H1N1 HA was cleaved by matriptase and KLK5 to a similar extent without 16 and with 10nM SPINT2. 500nM SPINT2 led to a relative cleavage reduction of about 70% and 50% for 17 matriptase and KLK5, respectively (Figure 2A and B). KLK5-mediated cleavage of H3N2 HA was reduced by 18 about 10% when KLK5 was pre-incubated with 10nM SPINT2 and by about 60% when 500nM SPINT2 was 19 used (Figure 2A and C).

First, we co-transfected the 2 full length TMPRSS2, HAT and matriptase with HMPV F in VERO cells. The F protein was then radioactively 3 labeled with 35 S methionine and cleavage was examined by quantifying the F0 full length protein and the 4 F1 cleavage product. We found that TMPRSS2 and HAT were able to efficiently cleave HMPV F while 5 matriptase decreased the expression of F, though it is not clear if this was due to general degradation of 6 protein or lower initial expression. However, matriptase demonstrated potential low-level cleavage when 7 co-transfected ( Figure 3A and B). We then examined cleavage by the exogenous proteases KLK5, KLK12 8 and matriptase.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/752592 doi: bioRxiv preprint grows significantly better in cell culture compared with HMPV. First, we tested whether cleavage 1 inhibition by SPINT2 resulted in the inhibition of cell-cell fusion. As described above, matriptase and KLK5 2 were pre-incubated with 10nM and 500nM SPINT2 and subsequently added to VERO cells expressing 3 A/CA/04/09 (H1N1) HA or A/Shanghai/2/2013 (H7N9) HA. Cells were then briefly exposed to a low pH 4 buffer to induce fusion and subsequently analyzed using an immune fluorescence assay. When matriptase 5 and KLK5 were tested with 10nM SPINT2 and incubated with VERO cells expressing H1N1 HA, we still 6 observed syncytia formation ( Figure 4A ). However, 500mM SPINT2 resulted in the abrogation of syncytia 7 formation triggered by cleavage of the respective HA by matriptase and KLK5. We made the same 8 observation when we tested KLK5 and H7N9 HA ( Figure 4B ). Matriptase-mediated H7N9 HA syncytia 9 formation was inhibited by the addition of 10nM SPINT2 ( Figure 4B ). To ensure that cell-cell fusion 10 inhibition is a result of HA cleavage inhibition through SPINT2 but not a side effect of SPINT2 treatment 11 per se we expressed A/Vietnam/1204/2004 (H5N1) HA in VERO cells and treated them with the inhibitor. 12 H5N1 HA possesses a HPAI cleavage site and is cleaved intracellularly by furin during its maturation 13 process. SPINT2 does not inhibit furin and is not able to cross cell membranes. Thus, SPINT2 can not 14 interfere with the proteolytic processing of H5N1 HA and therefore this control allows to examine whether 15 SPINT2 interferes with cell-cell fusion. Figure 4C shows that H5N1 HA forms large syncytia in the absence 16 of SPINT2 as well as in the presence of 500 nM SPINT2. Hence, we conclude that SPINT2 does not have a 17 direct inhibitory effect on cell-cell fusion. 18",

CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a in the in vivo cleavage of H9N2 HA and our results described above suggest a role for matriptase in the 1 activation of H7N9 (19, 44) . At 18 hours post transfection we infected MDCK cells with A/CA/04/09 (H1N1) 2 at a MOI of 0.1 and subsequently added SPINT2 protein at different concentrations. Non-transfected cells 3 served as a control and exogenous trypsin was added to facilitate viral propagation. The supernatants 4 were harvested 48 hours post infection and viral titers were subsequently analyzed using an immuno-5 plaque assay. SPINT2 initially mitigated trypsin-mediated growth of H1N1 at a concentration of 50nM and 6 the extent of inhibition slightly increased with higher concentrations ( Figure 5A , Table 3A ). The highest 7 tested SPINT2 concentration of 500nM reduced viral growth by about 1 log ( Figure 5A , Table 3A ). We 8 observed a similar pattern with cells transfected with human matriptase ( Figure 5B , Table 3A ). Growth 9 inhibition started at a SPINT2 concentration of 50nM and with the application of 500nM growth was 10 reduced by approximately 1.5 logs ( Figure 5B , Table 3A ). When we infected cells expressing TMPRSS2 with 11 H1N1 and added SPINT2, viral growth was significantly reduced at a concentration of 150nM. Addition of 12 500nM SPINT2 led to a reduction of viral growth of about 1.5 logs ( Figure 5C , Table 3A ). We also tested 13 whether SPINT2 could reduce the growth of a H3N2 virus because it is major circulating seasonal influenza 14 subtype. However, TMPRSS2 and matriptase do not seem to activate H3N2 viruses (19, 45) . Hence, trypsin 15 and SPINT2 were added to the growth medium of cells infected with A/X31 H3N2. Compared to control 16 cells without added inhibitor SPINT2 significantly inhibited trypsin-mediated H3N2 growth at a 17 concentration of 50nM ( Figure 5D , Table 3A ). At the highest SPINT2 concentration of 500nM viral growth 18 was reduced by about 1 log ( Figure 5D ). 19",

Other 10 synthetic and peptide-like molecules designed to inhibit very specific serine proteases such as TMPRSS2, 11 TMPRSS4 and TMPRSS11D (HAT) were only tested with those proteases and their potential to inhibit other 12 proteases relevant for influenza A activation remains unclear (53-55). Currently, the most promising 13 antiviral protein inhibitor is camostat which is already approved in Japan for the treatment of chronic 14 pancreatitis (56). Recently, it was demonstrated that camostat inhibited influenza replication in cell 15 culture and prevented the viral spread and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV in mice by inhibition of serine 16 proteases (55, 57). However, camostat was applied prior to the virus infection and it was administered 17 into the mice via oral gavage (57) . A previous study showed that SPINT2 significantly attenuated influenza 18 A infections in mice using a concentration that was 40x lower than the described camostat concentration 19 and intranasal administration was sufficient (26). Our current study suggests that SPINT2 is able to 20 significantly inhibit viral spread during an ongoing infection and does not need to be applied prior or at 21 the start of an infection. The mouse study also showed that SPINT2 can be applied directly to the 22 respiratory tract while camostat that is currently distributed as a pill and therefore less organ specific. In 23 addition, camostat is synthetic whereas SPINT2 is a naturally occurring molecule which may attenuate 24 .

Future research 1 will be conducted to test if SPINT2 can be applied more efficiently via an inhaler and to explore potential 2 side effects in mice studies. However, when we tested the potential of SPINT2 to inhibit viral replication 3 in a cell culture model we were only able to achieve growth reductions of approximately 1 -1.5 logs after 4 48 hours with a concentration of 500nM SPINT2. One potential explanation is that 500nM SPINT2 was 5 unable to saturate the proteases present in the individual experiments and was not sufficient to prevent 6 viral growth. In addition, the continuous overexpression of matriptase and TMPRSS2 may have produced 7 an artificially high quantity of protein that exceeded the inhibitory capacities of SPINT2. This problem 8 could be solved either by using higher concentration of SPINT2 or by optimizing its inhibitory properties. 9",

SPINT2 did not express any cytotoxic effects up to a concentration 12 of 10mM, significantly above the therapeutic dosage required for inhibition. In comparison with other 13 studies, the SPINT2 concentration we used here were in the nanomolar range while other published 14 inhibitors require micromolar concentrations (53-55). However, we believe that future research will allow 15 to fully utilize the potential of SPINT2 as a broad-spectrum antiviral therapy. Wu et al., recently described 16 that the Kunitz domain I of SPINT2 is responsible for the inhibition of matriptase (28). In future studies we 17 will explore whether the inhibitory capabilities of SPINT2 can be condensed into small peptides that may 18 improve its efficacy. Its ability to inhibit a broad range of serine protease that are involved in the activation 19 of influenza A suggest that a SPINT2 based antiviral therapy could be efficient against other pathogens 20 too. TMPRSS2, for example, not only plays a major role in the pathogenesis of H1N1 but is also required 21 for the activation of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and HMPV (58, 59). Currently, treatment options for these 22 viruses are very limited and therefore SPINT2 could become a viable option if its potential as an antiviral 23 therapeutic can be fully exploited. 24 .

These viruses are believed to be activated by furin 3 and pro-protein convertases that belong to the class of subtilisin-like proteases (61). Preliminary data 4 from our lab demonstrated that SPINT2 did not inhibit furin-mediated cleavage of HPAI cleavage site 5 peptide mimics as well as peptides carrying described furin cleavage sites (data not shown). In addition, 6 furin acts intracellularly and we have no evidence that SPINT2 is able to penetrate the cell membrane and 7 thus inhibiting proteases located in intracellular compartments. Therefore, it seems unlikely that SPINT2 8 is able to inhibit furin in cell culture-based studies or in vivo experiments. 9",
