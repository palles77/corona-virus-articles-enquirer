            "text": "RNA viruses carry out selective packaging of their genomes in a variety of ways, many involving a genomic packaging signal. The first coronavirus packaging signal was discovered nearly thirty years ago, but how it functions remains incompletely understood. This review addresses the current state of knowledge of coronavirus genome packaging, which has mainly been studied in two prototype species, mouse hepatitis virus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Despite the progress that has been made in the mapping and characterization of some packaging signals, there is conflicting evidence as to whether the viral nucleocapsid protein or the membrane protein plays the primary role in packaging signal recognition. The different models for the mechanism of genomic RNA packaging that have been prompted by these competing views are described. Also discussed is the recent exciting discovery that selective coronavirus genome packaging is critical for in vivo evasion of the host innate immune response.",

            "text": "The concluding stages of viral replication typically involve assembly and egress of progeny virions from the infected cell. At this point viruses must address a critical issue consequential to their parasitic status -genome packaging. The most fundamental formulation of the packaging problem is: how do viruses ensure the specific incorporation of their genomes into assembled virions, faced with competition from numerous other nucleic acid species in the infected cell? For RNA viruses (most of which are cytoplasmic), the solutions that have evolved to overcome this problem vary considerably, according to the needs imposed by the wide range of lifestyles and replication strategies that RNA viruses can follow. A broad array of positive-strand RNA viruses (picornaviruses, flaviviruses, alphaviruses, coronaviruses, and retroviruses) and negative-strand RNA viruses (rhabdoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and orthomyxoviruses) are generally held to selectively package genome-length RNA of the correct polarity and to exclude other viral and host species. This process occurs with a high degree of efficiency, although noteworthy exceptions can be found. For example, retroviruses package abundant amounts of host 7SL RNA (Onafuwa-Nuga et al., 2006) , and arenaviruses incorporate entire ribosomes (Sarute and Ross, 2017) .",

            "text": "Specific packaging is often mediated by well-defined cis-acting RNA sequences or structures within the viral genome, designated packaging signals (PSs). One of the most intensively studied PS elements, named psi, is contained in the 5\u2032 leader region of the HIV genome. The mechanism by which psi functions remains to be fully resolved, but recent studies have revealed that genome dimerization promotes the folding of psi and neighboring RNA elements into a conformer in which the genomic splice donor site is sequestered (Keane et al., 2015 (Keane et al., , 2016 . These and other structural features suggest how the viral Gag protein selects unspliced genomic RNA and how packaging is coupled to dimerization of the pseudodiploid retroviral genome. Another well characterized PS occurs within the nsP1 coding region of the genome of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and is highly conserved in many other alphaviruses. This element consists of a cluster of short stem-loop structures, each containing a GGG loop motif, which appear to contribute additively to the efficiency of genome packaging (Kim et al., 2011) .",

Although bi-and tri-segmented viruses may depend upon stochastic processes in order to accumulate virions with a complete genome, a recent analysis by single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization has shown that most individual influenza virions have a full complement of eight genome segments (Chou et al., 2012) . Segment-specific PSs map near the termini of each segment, but how the network of segment-segment interactions is established is not yet precisely defined (Bolte et al., 2019) .

Picornaviruses and flaviviruses, most of which lack a PS, tightly couple packaging to RNA replication (Nugent et al., 1999; Barrows et al., 2018) . In particular, for poliovirus no clearly defined PS has ever been uncovered, despite extensive searches (Jiang et al., 2014) . Moreover, exhaustive recoding experiments appear to rule out the existence of cryptic PSs in the poliovirus genome (Song et al., 2017) . This has led to the hypothesis that polio capsid protein-replicase interactions are sufficient to ensure the specificity of genome packaging. An alternative view that is developing for many other icosahedral positive-strand RNA viruses is that there exist multiple dispersed (and in many cases, poorly defined) genomic PSs. These are postulated to serve as recognition sites for capsid subunits, which cause collapse of genomic RNA into a more condensed configuration through protein-protein interactions. The resulting compacted intermediate structure then recruits additional capsid subunits to complete assembly of the virion shell (Borodavka et al., 2012; Mendes and Kuhn, 2018) .",

They have long been studied, in part because of their significant impact on livestock and companion animals. In humans, four coronaviruses, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1, generally cause upper respiratory tract infections and are prevalent worldwide. Of paramount concern to human health, however, are two deadly coronaviruses that emerged just in this century (de Wit et al., 2016) . The first of these, the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), originated in bats. SARS-CoV caused an outbreak of atypical pneumonia that began in China in late 2002, spread worldwide, and was extinguished by mid-2003 through the rigorous application of public health measures. All told, the SARS epidemic was characterized by high human-to-human transmission and a case-fatality rate of 10%. Although SARS-CoV was eliminated from the human population, very closely related coronaviruses persist in bat reservoirs, posing a constant threat for reemergence. The second most noteworthy human coronavirus is the one responsible for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), an outbreak of severe pneumonia that began in Saudi Arabia in 2012. At present, MERS is confined to the Arabian peninsula, from where cases have sporadically dispersed to other parts of the world. Like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV has an ancestral origin in bats, but its proximal reservoir is dromedary camels, and transmission from this source in ongoing. In contrast to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV does not spread as efficiently through human-to-human contact; nevertheless, it has an alarming case-fatality rate of 36%. The emergence of these two previously unknown coronaviruses has stimulated efforts to fully understand all aspects of the molecular biology of members of this family.",

S, E, and M are embedded in a membrane envelope derived from the site of budding, the Golgi-endoplasmic reticulum intermediate compartment. The nucleocapsid resides in the interior of the virion envelope.

The downstream end of the genome contains the genes for the structural proteins in the invariant order S-E-M-N, as well as interspersed accessory genes. The 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome contains two open reading frames (rep1a and rep1b) encoding the viral replicase-transcriptase polyprotein, which is expressed by a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism. The replicase is cotranslationally processed into 15 or 16 subunits designated nonstructural proteins (nsps) that carry out RNAsynthesis functions common to most RNA viruses, as well as a collection of enzymatic activities unique to coronaviruses and other members of the nidovirus order (Ziebuhr, 2005) .",

DI RNAs are extensively deleted gRNAs that retain the necessary cis-acting RNA elements that allow them to propagate by parasitizing the replicative machinery of the parental virus from which they originate. Comparisons of naturally arising and engineered DI RNAs that were either able or unable to be packaged into purified virions allowed the localization of the MHV PS to a portion of the replicase gene (Makino et al., 1990; van der Most et al., 1991) . A more detailed study finely mapped the PS to a 190-nt segment of rep1b (Fosmire et al., 1992) . This locus is some 20 kb downstream from the 5\u2032 end of the genome, distant from cis-acting RNA elements required for viral RNA replication. As would be expected, it only appears in gRNA and not in the nested set of sgRNAs. Further mutational analysis identified a proposed 69-nt substructure within the 190-nt segment as the minimal functional PS (Fosmire et al., 1992) . However, subsequent studies found that larger forms of the PS were more efficient for packaging of DI RNAs or heterologous RNAs into virions of helper virus or into virus-like particles (VLPs) formed from expressed structural proteins (Bos et al., 1996; Narayanan and Makino, 2001) . Moreover, it was shown that bovine coronavirus (BCoV), another lineage A betacoronavirus, recognizes the PS of MHV, and reciprocally, MHV recognizes the PS of BCoV .",

These repeat units are spaced at regular intervals, with a two-fold quasi-symmetry centered around an internal loop. It was noted by Chen et al. (2007) that their model has a different RNA fold than the previously reported 69-nt substructure of Fosmire et al. (1992) , and it is not in complete accord with that earlier study. The 95-nt bulged stem-loop structure was shown to be in good agreement with in vitro chemical and enzymatic probing experiments. It is also strongly supported by phylogenetic criteria (Fig. 2B ). The terminal loop and the repeat units are absolutely conserved in every currently known lineage A betacoronavirus. All other stem segments are preserved by covariation of base pairs. In contrast, wider divergence is allowed in the central internal loop, where numerous nucleotide substitutions or small insertions occur. Notably, the PS of equine coronavirus (EqCoV), a close relative of BCoV, contains a deletion that precisely encompasses the central bulge and one of the repeat units (Fig. 2B) .",

The PS RNA encodes a segment of nsp15 that is absent from the nsp15 sequences of betacoronavirus lineages B, C, and D, as well as those of alpha-, gamma-, and deltacoronaviruses (Fig. 2C ). The encoded polypeptide corresponds to a surface loop of MHV nsp15 (Xu et al., 2006 ) that does not exist in the nsp15 structures of SARS-CoV (Joseph et al., 2007) or MERS-CoV (Zhang et al., 2018) . Thus, there is no basis for the presumption that the same region of nsp15 contains the PS for either SARS-CoV (Hsieh et al., 2005) or MERS-CoV (Hsin et al., 2018) . The ancillary positioning of the PS-encoded protein loop suggests that this PS was a late acquisition during the evolution of the coronavirus family. Alternatively, it remains possible that this PS was originally present in a common ancestor of all coronaviruses and was subsequently lost from most of them; however, the advantage provided in vivo by selective gRNA packaging (see below) makes such a scenario less likely.",

This same segment was shown to contain the 5\u2032 cisacting elements necessary for RNA replication.

Among the features that are conserved across all genera is an articulated bulged stem-loop, denoted SL5, which straddles the 5\u2032 UTR-nsp1 boundary. In the alphacoronaviruses, as well as in all betacoronavirus lineages except lineage A, a set of substructures emerge from the apex of SL5. For TGEV, these SL5 insertions consist of three smaller stem-loops displaying repeats of the motif UUCCG(U/C) (Fig. 3B) ; three highly similar repeat units appear in all other alphacoronaviruses. Moreover, for the lineage B, C, and D betacoronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SL5 contains two or three repeating substructures, each with the loop motif UUUCGU. The repetitive nature of these elements, akin to that of the lineage A betacoronavirus PS (above) and to those of the PSs of alphaviruses (Kim et al., 2011) , led to the proposal that these are the corresponding PSs of the alpha-and betacoronaviruses in which they occur (Chen and Top, a schematic of the coronavirus genome (gRNA), typified by that of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). The 5\u2032 end contains the rep1a and rep1b genes, which encode the viral replicase-transcriptase, while the 3\u2032 end contains the structural protein genes S, E, M, and N. Also at the 3\u2032 end of the genome are accessory genes (unlabeled), the locations and numbers of which vary for different viruses; those shown are for MHV. Under the genome, to the right, are the nested set of subgenomic mRNAs (sgRNAs), of which MHV has six. To the left is a schematic of the virion, depicting the essential structural proteins: spike protein (S); membrane protein (M); envelope protein (E); and nucleocapsid protein (N).",

For the prototype gammacoronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), an early study was able to show packaging of a constructed 5.9-kb DI RNA composed of a mosaic of genome segments, although further localization of a PS was not pursued (Dalton et al., 2001) . For the deltacoronaviruses, genome packaging studies may be delayed by the fact that currently only one species from this genus, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), can be propagated in vitro (Hu et al., 2015) . However, the hallmarks of a coronavirus PS appear to be its insertion into a highly conserved region of the replicase gene and its display of repeated units of RNA sequence and structure. These criteria draw attention to a 104-nt RNA segment of the rep1b gene of some deltacoronaviruses that contains six small stemloops, five of which present a repeated GUAC loop motif (Fig. 3C ). This segment falls within a 40-amino-acid insertion at the nsp13-nsp14 junction that is present in roughly half of the known deltacoronavirus species, including bulbul coronavirus (BuCoV), but is absent from other members of the genus, including PDCoV.",

This allowed the complete disruption of PS RNA primary sequence and secondary structure in a manner that did not modify the product of the nsp15 gene in which it resides. Analysis of extensively purified virions revealed that the silPS mutant, in contrast to the wild type, packaged large amounts of sgRNAs in addition to gRNA (Fig. 4A) . The same loss of RNA packaging specificity was observed in another mutant in which the PS was entirely deleted. Moreover, it was shown that the PS was fully functional if deleted at its native site and transposed to another locus downstream of rep1b (but still unique to gRNA).

The minimally defective growth phenotype of PS mutants was at first surprising, because the prior studies with DI RNAs had fixed the notion that the PS is necessary for packaging of an RNA species into virions. However, the latter may only be true for DI RNAs, because in order to be packaged they must compete with the (PS-containing) genomes of helper viruses. In the intact viral genome the function of the coronavirus PS resembles that of the alphavirus PS, which confers selective packaging of its gRNA over that of a single, more numerous sgRNA. PS-negative alphavirus mutants, like their coronavirus counterparts, package both gRNA and sgRNA (Kim et al., 2011) . In contrast, PS-negative alphavirus mutants have much more severely growth-defective phenotypes, likely reflecting a limitation on the amount of RNA that can be accommodated by an icosahedral capsid. The helical coronavirus nucleocapsid, surrounded by a pleomorphic membrane envelope, is apparently considerably more tolerant to the inclusion of extraneous RNA.",

To address this issue, Athmer et al. (2018) examined viral replication in the mouse and discovered that packaging plays a decisive role in evasion of host innate immunity. This was most dramatically demonstrated by constructing the set of 20 silPS mutations in the highly neurovirulent JHM strain of MHV. Mice infected with the MHV-JHM-silPS mutant had decreased weight loss and greatly enhanced survival, compared to the substantial weight loss and nearly 100% mortality of those infected with wild-type MHV-JHM. Additionally, the mutant produced lower viral titers in the brains of infected mice and was cleared more rapidly than the wild type. This attenuation was shown to be strongly dependent upon type-I interferon (IFN) signaling, as virulence of the MHV-JHM-silPS mutant was almost completely restored in IFN alpha/beta receptor-knockout (IFNAR -/-) mice. However, the mutant remained attenuated in either mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein-knockout (MAVS -/-) mice or in toll-like receptor 7-knockout (TLR7 -/-) mice. These results indicated that neither MAVS nor TLR7 signaling alone can account for attenuation, suggesting that the two pathways are redundant or else that other circuitry is involved in initiation of the IFN response to the packaging mutant virus.",

This might suggest that MHV genome replication introduces base modifications to gRNA that are absent from, or inefficiently applied to, sgRNAs during transcription. A different, but less likely, possibility is that the PS itself antagonizes an innate immune sensor. Irrespective of mechanism, the critical in vivo impairment of MHV packaging mutants argues that gRNA packaging selectivity must be an essential property of all coronaviruses. Alternatively, coronaviruses that fail to maintain gRNA packaging selectivity would need to have evolved activities that suppress the particular components of innate immunity that become activated by packaging-negative virions.",

From this work it was found that, although the PS was bound more efficiently Left, the primary sequence and RNA secondary structure of the wildtype (wt) MHV PS was disrupted with 20 coding-silent mutations to create a mutant designated silPS (Kuo and Masters, 2013) .

Further pursuit of this observation by Narayanan et al. (2000) led to unexpected results. These investigators characterized the N-M interaction in infected cells, showing that anti-N antibody could coimmunoprecipitate M protein, and conversely, anti-M antibody could coimmunoprecipitate N protein. Moreover, pulse-labeling experiments demonstrated that M protein brought down by anti-N antibody was mostly unglycosylated; the O-glycosylation of MHV M protein occurs in the Golgi. Therefore, M and N associated in a pre-Golgi compartment assumed to be the virion budding site. Most significantly, in contrast to the precipitation of the full spectrum of viral RNA species by anti-N antibody, anti-M antibody coimmunoprecipitated only gRNA. Finally, it was found that the N-M interaction could not be initiated merely by coexpression of N and M, suggesting a requirement for some other viral component.",

However, intracellular association of M protein with a given DI RNA correlated completely with the packaging ability of that DI RNA, which, in turn, was absolutely dependent upon the presence of the PS. Furthermore, it was shown that in MHV-infected cells N protein became bound to an expressed (nonreplicating) nonviral RNA (CAT gene RNA), whether or not it harbored the PS. Only the version of CAT gene RNA containing the PS was bound by M protein and was packaged into virions.",

Here it was shown that anti-M antibody precipitated CAT gene (PS+) RNA, but not CAT gene (PS-) RNA, from cells that were expressing both M protein and N protein. Remarkably, the same result was obtained if only M protein, but not N protein, was expressed. Finally, it was demonstrated that CAT gene (PS +) RNA was packaged into VLPs produced solely by expression of the MHV M and E proteins, in the absence of N protein. These results strongly implied that M protein (possibly with the assistance of E) is the viral component that recognizes and binds to the PS, and that formation of a nucleocapsid with N protein is not required for packaging specificity.",

            "text": "The presence in the coronavirus N protein of two distinct RNAbinding domains, the NTD and the CTD, is an unusual characteristic for an RNA virus nucleocapsid protein (Chang et al., 2014) . To probe the functional significance of this arrangement, a genetic study was carried out in which each of these domains in the MHV N protein was substituted by its counterpart from the SARS-CoV N protein (Kuo et al., 2014) . The NTDs and CTDs of MHV and SARS-CoV have 44% and 35% amino-acid identity, respectively. This degree of homology was expected to be sufficiently close to allow such substitutions to be viable, while also being sufficiently divergent to uncover sequence-specific interactions between N protein domains and other viral components. Indeed, both substitutions were well tolerated by MHV, and neither affected the N protein-M protein interaction or the fidelity of the leaderbody sgRNA junctions formed during transcription. However, substitution of the CTD profoundly affected packaging. Notably, the SARS-CoV CTD substitution mutant had the same packaging-defective phenotype as that of the silPS mutant (above, Fig. 4A ), despite having a completely wild-type copy of the PS. By contrast, the NTD substitution mutant had a wild-type packaging phenotype. Further construction of partial SARS-CoV chimeras of the MHV N CTD showed that substitution by just a 30-amino-acid central region of the SARS-CoV CTD was sufficient to abolish packaging (Fig. 4B ). As discussed above, the MHV PS is unique to lineage A betacoronaviruses, and the genome of SARS-CoV (a lineage B betacoronavirus) does not contain a homolog of this RNA structure (Chen and Olsthoorn, 2010) . Thus, the SARS-CoV N protein likely would not have evolved to recognize the MHV PS. This outcome was reinforced by the subsequent demonstration that a mutant with a substitution of the even more divergent N protein CTD of the alphacoronavirus TGEV also exhibited a packaging-defective phenotype (Kuo et al., 2016b) .",

The NTD displays a beta-platform presenting a potential RNA-binding groove rich in basic and aromatic amino-acid residues, the latter of which are speculated to be able to form sequence-specific contacts with RNA bases. The CTD dimer, on the other hand, is a rectangular slab with a putative RNA-binding groove on one face that is lined with basic residues thought to be best suited for nonspecific interactions with the phosphodiester backbone.

Such substitutions abolished packaging, but it could not be concluded that this defect was solely due to M. The construction of SARS-CoV M chimeric mutants was possible only because they also incorporated substitution of the SARS-CoV domain N3, the carboxy-terminal tail of N protein that is necessary and sufficient for virion assembly interactions between N and M. To clarify this outcome, multiple previously isolated MHV domain N3 mutants (all containing wild-type MHV M protein) were screened for their packaging ability, and some were found to have lost selective packaging of gRNA. As with the CTD mutants, packaging-defective domain N3 mutants had the same phenotype as that of the silPS mutant but had a completely intact wild-type PS. Comparison of packagingcompetent and packaging-defective viruses allowed mapping of the packaging defect to a 9-amino-acid segment of domain N3 (Fig. 4B ) that was adjacent to, but distinct from, key residues that interact with M protein in virion assembly (Hurst et al., 2005) .",

However, these two sets of results are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and they possibly will be brought into alignment by further work. The apparent discrepancy between the outcomes of the two approaches may be analogous to the difference, discussed above, between the observed role of the MHV PS in DI RNA systems as opposed to its role in the intact viral genome. At this stage, the currently available data suggest three types of models for how coronavirus packaging selectivity is achieved (Fig. 5) .",

In this proposed mechanism, the largely acidic domain N3 is originally sequestered by the CTD and then becomes dislodged, directly or indirectly, only as a result of the CTD binding to the PS (Fig. 5A) . This may come about because the PS competes for the same site on the CTD that is occupied by the N3 peptide, or alternatively, because binding of the PS induces a conformational change in the CTD that frees N3 from a separate site. The resulting CTD-PS interaction would nucleate cooperative binding of N monomers along the whole length of the gRNA, with each monomer releasing its N3 domain to bind to an M monomer endodomain. The key feature of this model is that domain N3 is not available to interact with M protein until the CTD has bound to the PS. Thereby, RNA molecules that do not contain the PS are excluded from packaging, even though they may be nonspecifically bound by other N monomers.",

Although N protein is most likely the first virion structural protein to encounter the genome during, or shortly following, gRNA synthesis in the replication compartment (Bost et al., 2001; Stertz et al., 2007) , its initial mode of binding to gRNA is proposed to be the same as that to all sgRNAs. The specific binding of M to the PS is thus envisioned to trigger formation of the helical ribonucleoprotein by N and concomitant incorporation of the nucleocapsid into nascent virions (Narayanan and Makino, 2001; Narayanan et al., 2003) . This would suggest that in each assembled virion, there exists a unique point of protein-gRNA contact, between M and the PS, which cannot be discerned at the current level of resolution of ultrastructural work (B\u00e1rcena et al., 2009; Neuman et al., 2011) .",

A more productive approach might be to target basic amino-acid residues in the M endodomain that are common to lineage A betacoronaviruses but are not conserved in the other lineages. For N protein, a similar strategy applied to clusters of charged surface residues of the CTD could pinpoint interactions with domain N3 or the PS. Complementary biochemical investigations need to be undertaken to examine the RNA-binding properties of full-length N protein, as well constructs of the CTD and CTD-N3. The methods used in many recent studies to examine N binding to nonspecific RNA and DNA (Chang et al., 2009 (Chang et al., , 2014 ought to now be applied to PS RNA.

Understanding virion assembly cannot be separated from the need to more generally comprehend the molecular details of coronavirus N-N and N-RNA interactions. Although structures are currently available for 6 NTDs and 4 CTDs from different viruses, there is as yet no structure for an RNA-bound complex of either of these domains. Likewise, no structure has been solved for an entire N protein, with or without an RNA ligand, but a recent low-resolution cryo-EM reconstruction of MHV N has taken the first step in that direction (Gui et al., 2017) . At the next level, we lack a clear picture of the coronavirus nucleocapsid. More basically, we lack even fundamental parameters, such as the stoichiometry of N to RNA. One speculative model of the nucleocapsid has 7 nucleotides of RNA being bound by one monomer of N (Chang et al., 2014) ; however, another estimate places this ratio at 14 to 40 nucleotides per N monomer (Neuman et al., 2011) . A high-resolution nucleocapsid structure would provide details of how each NTD and CTD encapsidates gRNA and why the helical coronavirus nucleocapsid is much more flexible than the helical nucleocapsids of rhabdo-and paramyxoviruses. Similarly, a more detailed model of M protein structure, oligomerization, and M-N interactions in the virion would be highly valuable, although this will be a still more technically daunting achievement.",

Additionally, more precise elucidation of packaging-specific oligomeric interactions could uncover molecular targets that would hinder the escape of drug-resistant viral mutants (Tanner et al., 2014) .",

Circles denote basepairs in double-stranded sections that co-vary between MHV and one of the other viruses; additional base-pairing covariation is found among different strains of MHV and of HCoV-HKU1 (not shown). Triangles denote bases in single-stranded sections that differ from MHV; the shaded rectangle indicates the part of the structure that is deleted in EqCoV. (C) Amino-acid alignment of part of the nsp15 subunit of the replicase-transcriptase. Highlighted in red is the segment encoded by the PS of lineage A betacoronaviruses. This segment is absent from all other lineages and genera, here represented by SARS-CoV (betacoronavirus, lineage B), MERS-CoV (betacoronavirus, lineage C), TGEV (alphacoronavirus), IBV (gammacoronavirus), and PDCoV (deltacoronavirus).
