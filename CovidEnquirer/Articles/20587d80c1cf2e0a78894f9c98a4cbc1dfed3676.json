Most CPE can be readily observed in unfixed, unstained cell cultures, under low power of the light microscope, with the condenser racked down and the iris diaphragm partly closed to obtain the contrast required in looking at translucent cells. A trained observer can distinguish several types of CPE in living cultures (Plate 2-2 and Table 2 -2), but fixation and staining of the cell monolayer is necessary in order to see details such as inclusion bodies and syncytia.

Some viruses multiply readily in cell culture on primary isolation; the time at which cytopathic changes first become detectable depends to some extent on the number of virions that the specimen contained, but, far more important, on the growth rate of the virus in question. Enteroviruses and herpes simplex virus, for example, which have a short latent period and a high yield, often show detectable CPE after 24 to 48 hours, destroying the monolayer completely within about 3 days. On the other hand, cytomegaloviruses, rubella, and some of the more slowly growing adenoviruses may not produce detectable CPE for several weeks. Since the cell cultures may have undergone nonspecific degeneration during this period it may be necessary to subinoculate the cells and supernatant fluid from the infected culture on to fresh monolayers. CPE often appears soon after such \"blind passage,\" either because this enhances the titer or selects variants adapted to grow better in the cultured cells. PLATE (Shelokov et ah, 1958) , is due to the incorporation into the plasma membrane of newly synthesized viral protein that has an affinity for red blood cells (Plate 2-2D). Hemadsorption can be used to recognize infection with noncytopathogenic viruses, as well as the early stages of infection with cytocidal viruses.",

Nearly all of the viruses that were k n o w n at that time can be grown in the cells of one or another of the embryonic membranes, namely the amnion, allantois, chorion, or yolk sac ( Fig. 2-1 Davis et al., 1967.) Eggs are inoculated 5-14 days after fertilization, depending on the state of development of the membrane it is proposed to infect. A hole is drilled in the shell, and virus is injected into the fluid bathing the appropriate membrane. Following incubation for a further 2 -5 days, viral growth can be recognized by one or more of the criteria listed in Table 2 Embryonated eggs are rarely employed now for viral isolation, but the allantois produces such high yields of certain viruses, like the influenza viruses and avian adenoviruses, that this system is used both by research laboratories and for vaccine production.",

Dulbecco (1952; Dulbecco and Vogt, 1954) introduced to animal virology a modification of the bacteriophage plaque assay that is now used very widely for the quantitation of animal viruses. A viral suspension is added to a monolayer of cultured cells for an hour or so to allow the virions to attach to the cells, then the liquid medium is replaced with a solid gel, which ensures that the spread of progeny particles is restricted to the immediate vicinity of the originally infected cell. Hence, each infective particle gives rise to a localized focus of infected cells that becomes, after a few days, large enough to see with the naked eye (Plate 2-3). (From Kilbourne, 1969; courtesy Or. E.D. Kilbourne.) Various materials have been used to form the gel with which the cell monolayer is overlaid shortly after inoculation. They include agar, methylcellulose, tragacanth, and starch gel. Agar has been most commonly employed, but suffers from the disadvantage that it contains sulfated polysaccharides that inhibit the growth of some viruses; however, this inhibitory substance can be neutralized by the addition of DEAE-dextran to the agar. Of course, the gel must also incorporate the usual nutrient medium required to maintain the cells in a viable condition.",

Serial dilutions of virus are inoculated into several replicate cell cultures, eggs, or animals. Adequate time is allowed for virus to multiply and spread to destroy the whole cell culture, or kill the animal, as the case may be. Hence, each host yields only a single piece of information, namely, whether or not it was infected by that particular dilution of virus. A more economical procedure can be used with viruses such as vaccinia that produce localized skin lesions in an animal like the rabbit. Twenty or thirty skin sites can be separately inoculated, each giving an all-or-none answer equivalent to the death or survival of a cell culture or a mouse. A good example of an accurate quantal assay is the titration of influenza viral infectivity in squares of allantois-on-shell maintained in vitro in plastic trays, the test being read by hemagglutination (Fazekas de St. Groth and White, 1958) .",

            "text": "Efficiency of Plating. In their pioneering quantitative studies of the multiplication of bacterial viruses, Ellis and Delbriick (1939) introduced the term efficiency of plating (EOP) to give a numerical value to the plaque count obtained with the same phage preparation using different susceptible bacteria as host organisms. The absolute EOP is defined as the plaque count relative to the total number of viral particles in the sample. Luria et al. (1951) , using electron microscopic counts, showed that the absolute EOP of the T-even phages could approach unity. In animal virus systems, the absolute EOP is always low and often very low, ranging from 1 0 -1 to 1 0 -6 . In other words, depending on the virus-cell combination under study, the proportion of virus particles in the suspension that score as infectious ranges from an upper limit of about 10 to as low as 0.0001%. This constitutes a major difference between bacteriophage and animal virus systems and has been a major cause of difficulty in animal virus genetics. Several factors contribute to the low plating efficiency of animal viruses. A certain proportion of the virions in any given suspension are noninfectious; most of these were once infectious but have been inactivated during growth or preparation, others are genetically defective in that they lack a complete genome or are completely \"empty\" (see Chapter 3). However, the major contribution to low EOP comes from the low susceptibility (i.e., high resistance) of the assay systems available, and a great deal of effort has been devoted to improving the efficiency of certain model systems so that genetic and biochemical studies can be performed.",

Similarly, using phenotypic mixing of Newcastle disease virus as an index of mixedly infected cells, Granoff (1961) obtained evidence which suggested that the majority of virions that were nonplaque producers contributed something to the yield from doubly infected cells, which yielded phenotypically mixed virus and both parental genotypes.",

Most work on infectious viral DNA has been carried out with polyoma virus, which on extraction yields three different forms of DNA molecule (see Chapter 3). These are a closed circle double-stranded supercoiled form (sedimentation coefficient in neutral conditions, 20 S), a relaxed form (sedimentation coefficient, 16 S) resulting from at least one scission in one of the strands, and linear double-stranded molecules of varying length, which may result from double-stranded breakage of the viral nucleic acid or may be cellular DNA from pseudovirions (Winocour, 1969) .

Possible explanations include the following: (a) difficulty in preparing nonfragmented DNA, an unlikely explanation with adenoviruses, (b) a topological requirement-uncoating may have to occur at a specific cellular site, (c) an internal viral protein associated with the DNA may perhaps serve to modify transcriptional patterns, and (d) these viruses may contain undetected polymerases.

More clearly than any other observation, it showed that the viral genome was the repository of all viral genetic information. In the laboratory, it has extended the host range of viruses; for example, poliovirus RNA will infect many cells and animals that are resistant to infection with poliovirions due to the absence of cellular receptors for the viral capsid (see Chapters 6 and 11). This demonstrates clearly that such \"resistant\" cells are in fact capable of supporting viral growth if a mechanism can be found for facilitating the entry of undegraded viral RNA into the cell. With a few viruses, notably SV40, the use of infectious DNA has been of great assistance in dissection of the functions of the genome. Persistent failure to demonstrate infectivity of the nucleic acids of some viruses led to the successful search for polymerases in their virions. Finally, infectious viral nucleic acids provide a convenient model for studying the more general problem of introducing functional nucleic acids into vertebrate cells. Although early attempts at mammalian gene transfer by isolated DNA (Szybalska and Szybalski, 1962) have not been repeated, the range of such possibilities was dramatically broadened by the claim that a metabolic lesion in a mammalian cell could be repaired by introducing the necessary gene via the DNA of a transducing bacteriophage (Merril et ah, 1971) .",

Such viruses can, therefore, bridge red blood cells to form a lattice. The phenomenon, known as hemagglutination, was first described by Hirst (1941) , who then went on to analyze the mechanism of hemagglutination by influenza virus. In this case, the hemagglutinating protein (hemagglutinin) on the virion is a glycoprotein, which occurs in the form of many short projections (see Plate 3-15). The virus will attach to any species of erythrocyte carrying complementary receptors, which are glycoproteins of a different sort. Hemagglutination by influenza and the paramyxoviruses, but not other viruses, is complicated by the fact that the virion also carries an enzyme, neuraminidase, which destroys the glycoprotein receptors on the erythrocyte surface and allows the virus to elute, unless the test is carried out at a temperature too low for the enzyme to act (4\u00b0C). About 10 7 influenza virions are required to cause macroscopic agglutination of a convenient number of chick erythrocytes (conventionally 0.25 ml of a 1% suspension of red cells). Thus hemagglutination is not a sensitive indicator of the presence of small numbers of virions, but because of its simplicity it provides a very convenient assay if large amounts of virus are available. The viral suspension is diluted serially (usually in twofold steps) in a plastic tray using a calibrated wire loop, and erythrocytes are added to each well. Unclumped red blood cells settle to form a \"button/ 7 whereas agglutinated cells form a \"shield\" (Plate 2-4).",

For example, influenza viruses can be concentrated and purified by adsorbing the virus on to red blood cells at 4\u00b0C. The cells are then washed free of impurities and the temperature is raised to 37\u00b0C. The enzyme neuraminidase, which is an integral part of the virions, begins to act and destroys the viral receptors on the red blood cells so that the viral particles are released. The red cells are then removed by low-speed centrifugation (Ada and Perry, 1954). However, for most animal viruses no such convenient short cuts are available, and purified suspensions are obtained by the sequential application of different fractionation techniques. Because the customary starting materials are large volumes of medium, infected cells or body fluids, containing small numbers of virions, the first step of purification often involves concentrating the viral particles by salting out with ammonium sulfate, precipitation with polyethylene glycol or ethanol, or adsorption onto, and elution from, ionexchange resins. The host components that are different in size from the particular virus under study are usually separated by differential centrifugation; low-speed centrifugation deposits large pieces of cell debris and subsequently high-speed centrifugation is used to pellet the virus.",

The solutes most commonly used in such gradients are buffered sucrose and glycerol, although for those viruses that are unaffected by solutions of high ionic strength, salts such as potassium bromide and tartrate are also satisfactory. The gradients are formed directly in the centrifuge tubes by mixing together solutions of different solute concentrations in such a way that there is a continuous linear gradation of density from the top to the bottom of the final column of liquid. The sample of virus is layered onto the gradient and during centrifugation sediments as a band through the gradient at a rate (sedimentation coefficient, S) which is determined by the size and weight of the viral particles, and which can be predicted by classic centrifugation theory. The centrifugation is usually stopped when the band of virus has traveled onehalf to two-thirds the length of the gradient, and samples are collected by piercing a hole through the bottom of the centrifuge tubes, or pumping a dense solute through the bottom of the tube and monitoring the effluent as it passes from the top. The viral band is located optically (with a spectrophotometer) or by radioactivity. virions are suspended in solutions, usually of alkali metal chlorides such as cesium chloride, which have high density and low viscosity. During high-speed centrifugation, the metal ions form a stable density gradient whose steepness is a reflection of the balance that is established between the tendency of the heavy metal ions to sediment through the solvent and their back-diffusion rate from more to less concentrated areas. Once the gradient is established the viral particles migrate to a position in the centrifuge tube where their density and that of the supporting medium are equal. When equilibrium is reached, the centrifuge is stopped, the bands of virus are collected, and the solute removed by dialysis or by passage through Sephadex columns.",

Because reassociation of the polynucleotide strands is a bimolecular reaction, the kinetics of reannealing are second order, and the rate of the reaction depends on the concentration of the nucleic acid, its size, its complexity, and the salt concentration in the solution (Wetmur and Davidson, 1968; Britten and Kohne, 1968) . The formation of native nucleic acid can be assayed by hydroxylapatite chromatography or by the use of nucleases which differentiate single-and double-stranded nucleic acids. A good example of the use of liquid hybridization in animal virology is the determination of the number of copies of viral DNA in transformed cells (see review by Gelb and Martin, 1971) . Small amounts of highly radioactive viral DNA are allowed to reanneal in the presence of large amounts of DNA either from virus-transformed or from control cells. Because the rate of reannealing of the radioactive viral DNA is proportional to its concentration in the solution, hybridization occurs faster in the presence of DNA from transformed cells than in the presence of control cell DNA's. By following the kinetics of the annealing of the radioactive DNA it is possible to determine directly the number of viral copies in DNA extracted from transformed cells (see Chapter 13).",

If the solution contains any labeled nucleic acid sequences which are complementary in base sequence to the DNA immobilized on the filter, then reannealing will occur. The extent of the reaction can be determined by measuring the amount of radioactivity specifically absorbed to the filters. This basic method has been used to detect the synthesis of virus-specific RNA in infected cells. However, many other uses have been described and many variations of the technique are available, for example, competition hybridization, in which filters containing immobilized DNA are reacted first with an excess of unlabeled RNA and then with smaller amounts of radioactive RNA. If the unlabeled RNA contains sequences which completely overlap those of the radioactive RNA then no label will adsorb to the filter because all the available sites on the DNA will have been saturated. If the sequences of the two RNA's are different then hybridization of the labeled RNA will occur. By using experiments of this sort it has been possible to determine which particular segments of viral genomes are transcribed into RNA at different times after infection. Clearly hybridization of nucleic acids is a powerful technique, and because of its simplicity and sensitivity, it has become an essential tool for the study of nucleic acid metabolism in virus-infected and transformed cells.",

In this method, acrylamide is polymerized to form cylinders or slabs, and the mixture of proteins under investigation is added to the top of the gel. When an electric current is applied across the ends of the gel, the proteins in the mixture migrate through it as bands at speeds which are governed, on the one hand, by the net charge of the protein molecules in the buffer conditions used, and, on the other hand, by the pore size of the gel. The smaller protein molecules pass through the pores formed by the polyacrylamide cross-links more easily than the larger proteins, and so they migrate faster. By adjusting the acrylamide concentrations within the range 5-15%, gels with pore sizes suitable for the separation of protein molecules with a wide spectrum of molecular weights can easily be generated. The position of the protein bands is determined either by staining the fixed gel with dyes like Coomassie Brilliant Blue, or by autoradiography, or by cutting it into small segments and counting the amount of radioactivity in each fraction.",

Before being placed on the gel the proteins are dissociated into their constituent polypeptide chains. The most commonly used conditions are heating to 80\u00b0C for a few minutes in the presence of reducing agents such as dithiothreitol or \u00df-mercaptoethanol, and the anionic detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The detergent binds to the separated polypeptide chains and gives all of them an overall net negative charge. The polypeptides separate in the gel entirely on the basis of their size; all charge differences are eliminated. Given that certain precautions are taken, the method gives a catalog of all the polypeptides present in a particular viral preparation, and as long as the polypeptides are not derived from glycoproteins, which behave anomalously in the system, the method gives extremely accurate estimates of the molecular weights of the polypeptides under study, (b) Nondenaturing conditions. These are sometimes used in order to keep the proteins in a native state, so that the separation in the gels is not of constituent polypeptides but rather of entire proteins. Since the migration of proteins without bound SDS is a function not only of their size but also of their overall charge, the buffers are tailored to match the characteristics of the particular protein under study.",

It is then a simple matter to dissociate the subunits into their constituent polypeptide chains by heating in sodium dodecyl sulfate and \u00df-mercaptoethanol, and to determine by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the precise composition of the morphological subunit in terms of the number of each species of constituent polypeptide and how they are bound together. The method cannot be applied universally, since it depends on successful disruption and separation of morphologically identifiable subunits, but at its best [see, for example, Rueckert's (1971) work with EMC (Chapter 3)] the technique provides an elegant and satisfying correlation between chemical and morphological subunits.",

The reactants diffuse through the agar at a rate inversely related to their molecular weights. Where antigen and antibody meet in \"optimal proportions\" a sharp line of precipitate forms in the agar. If several antigens and their corresponding antibodies are present, as in the case of most unpurified preparations of virus and of unabsorbed antiviral sera, each antigenantibody complex forms a discrete line.

On the other hand, the method does not lend itself readily to quantitation, i.e., it gives no accurate idea of the \"titer\" of the unknown antibody or antigen. Moreover, rather high concentrations of both reagents are necessary to ensure the formation of a visible line. It should be appreciated that as a rule purified viruses cannot be used as antigen in gel diffusion, because most virions are too large to diffuse through the agar at a satisfactory rate; crude preparations, on the other hand, usually contain most of the antigens of the virion in \"soluble\" or small particulate form, although some antibodies will react only with assembled virions and not with isolated coat proteins. This can present something of a technical problem, because if a particular antigen is present in particles of different size, several precipitin lines may result. Many of these drawbacks are overcome by an important new development whereby gel diffusion is rendered much more sensitive and can be quantitated (Schild et al., 1972) . Antigen, which can be whole virions but is preferably \"soluble,\" is incorporated throughout the agar; the lower the antigen concentration the higher the sensitivity of the test. Antisera placed in wells diffuses out and forms a precipitate with the antigen. The test is quantitated by measuring the diameter of the circle of precipitate. Sensitivity is increased by staining with thiazine red after washing out unprecipitated antigen (if \"soluble\"). Even greater sensitivity can be achieved if the antigen is radioactively labeled with 125 I, by autoradiography, or by counting a punched out circle of agar in a scintillation spectrometer.",

Accordingly, the CF test, as usually performed, will demonstrate substantial \"crossing\" between serotypes with a given group of viruses if those serotypes share common group (\"family\") antigens (e.g., adenoviruses). In this sense, it is not a highly specific test, since it does not always allow one to discriminate between antibodies to different serotypes. It is also not a particularly sensitive test, in that antibody titers determined by CF are lower than those obtained in neutralization or HI tests on the same serum. Yet, this is the test of choice for the preliminary screening of a serum for antibody, when one has little idea of even the group to which the causative virus belongs. For example, a single CF test using any adenovirus serotype as antigen will detect serum antibodies provoked by any other adenovirus serotype. Once \"groupspecific\" antibodies have been determined in this way, the neutralization or HI test can be invoked to identify \"type-specific\" antibodies, should that information be required.",

For example, if one wishes to know what class of antibody molecules which specifically react with a given antigen are present in serum, the following approach could be used. A sample of the serum is subjected in the normal way to immunoelectrophoresis in agar gels on glass slides. Antiglobulin serum is then diffused into the gel so that arcs of precipitation occur, corresponding to the different classes of antibody. The slides containing the agar and reagents are thoroughly washed and the radiolabeled antigen is diffused into the gel. The slides are again thoroughly washed, stained, and subjected to radioautography.
