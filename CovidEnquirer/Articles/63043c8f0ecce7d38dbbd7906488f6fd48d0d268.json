Systems that require human involvement to actively collect data or enter it into a dedicated system are likely to be abandoned or become less effective after many years of data collection with no real events [14] . Systems that run continuously in the background are more efficient and allow generation of data on the background incidence and variability of different clinical syndromes. Additional benefits of these systems include improved recognition of naturally occurring outbreaks and facilitation of research with large emergency department databases. These systems are generally designed so that individual patient identifiers are not sent to the central database, but public health reporting is exempted from Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements for patient consent to share information [15] .",

Syndromic surveillance has been found to correlate with activity of some common viruses, such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [16] , but the more difficult task of detecting the first cases of a new outbreak has not been seen. Even with these surveillance systems in place, the initial detection of a bioterrorism event may still result from laboratory identification of anthrax, smallpox, plague, or Ebola virus. It is unlikely that any syndromic surveillance system would have detected the United States mail-related anthrax cases of 2001 before the first case was identified through laboratory testing of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Unfortunately, microbiologic identification in the laboratory usually takes a couple of days, during which the outbreak may spread beyond easy containment. Investing in rapid laboratory testing methods that could be performed during emergency department evaluation might improve early detection. The real test will be when the next outbreak or bioterrorism event occurs.",

It occurs naturally as a zoonotic disease of persons who handle contaminated animal products, such as hair or hides.

Anthrax was studied as a possible weapon by the United States when it had an active biological weapons program, and has been weaponized by other countries [17] . Anthrax bacteria are easy to cultivate in the microbiology laboratory and can be readily induced to produce spores. The Soviet Union produced weaponized anthrax in ton quantities during the cold war era. An outbreak of inhalational anthrax occurred near a Soviet bioweapons facility at Sverdlovsk in 1979, resulting in 77 infections and 66 deaths, with some victims becoming ill up to 6 weeks after exposure [18] . The Japanese cult group Aum Shinrikyo attempted several attacks with anthrax in the 1990s but were unsuccessful [19] .",

The goal was to vaccinate 500,000 health care workers, but only a very small number actually received the vaccine. Many health care workers declined vaccination because of concerns about adverse reactions [45] . An advisory panel recommended against routine vaccination of emergency physicians because of concern that even a small risk for adverse reactions outweighed the minimal benefit that could be expected from smallpox vaccination in the absence of smallpox transmission anywhere in the world [46] . In the event of even a single smallpox case or a credible imminent threat, the benefits of smallpox vaccination would become clearer. Performing a rigorous scientific analysis of the risks and benefits for smallpox vaccination is impossible, because the true risk of a smallpox attack is unknown. The probability that any individual physician would be among those to see the first few cases of a smallpox outbreak is extremely low. Because smallpox vaccine can provide protection up to several days after exposure, a strategy to ensure timely vaccination of exposed health care workers and the general public if a smallpox case is identified would avoid the risk for unnecessary adverse reactions to smallpox vaccine while smallpox does not exist. Emergency and infectious disease physicians should work with public health authorities to ensure that these mechanisms are in place.",

Brucellae are facultative intracellular pathogens, and replication and spread seem to occur through lymphatics and hematogenous dissemination. Brucella species can survive for many weeks in soil or water. B suis was weaponized by the United States in the 1940s and 1950s; other countries are also suspected to have weaponized brucellae. Brucella organisms are highly infectious when aerosolized; consequently, inhalation will be the most likely route of infection during a terrorist attack. The organism could be spread as a slurry in bomblets or as a dry aerosol [61] .",

The infection tends to localize in tissues with large numbers of macrophages, such as lung, spleen, liver, central nervous system (CNS), bone marrow, and synovium. Symptoms vary because of the widespread nature of infection. In most instances, the intermittent fever phase lasts for several weeks, followed by a period of remission, during which symptoms may wane or disappear altogether. The fever and other symptoms then recur. This pattern of periodic febrile waves and remission can last for months or even years. Although chronic cases of brucellosis can be very debilitating, the disease is rarely fatal. Fever, chills, sweats, anorexia, headache, and malaise are common manifestations.

After an incubation period of several days, symptoms begin as fever, headache, and myalgias. Conjunctivitis, relative bradycardia, and leukopenia may be present. Jaundice occurs secondary to hepatitis, and gastrointestinal bleeding may also occur. Death can occur 7 to 10 days after onset. Treatment of yellow fever is supportive.
