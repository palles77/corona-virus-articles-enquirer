            "text": "Coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) possesses a membrane glycoprotein (M) which is targeted to the Golgi apparatus (GA). We used immunocytochemistry with an organelle-specific antiserum to investigate the morphologic changes of the GA during infection of L2 murine fibroblasts with MHV-A59. Twenty-four hours after infection the GA was fragmented and translocated in the center of syncytia, while the microtubular network was also rearranged displaying radiating elements toward the center of syncytia. Two fusion-defective mutants, which contain an identical amino acid substitution in the cleavage signal sequence of the spike glycoprotein (S), induced fragmentation of the GA. However, the GA migrated only partially to the centers of syncytia during infection with these mutants. Revertant viruses, in which the above mutation was corrected, had fusion properties and GA staining similar to wtMHV-A59. Experiments with brefeldin A (BFA), which induces redistribution of the GA into the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), revealed that an intact GA for a period of 4-16 hr postinfection, is required for coronavirus replication and syncytia formation. Thus, during MHV infection, syncytia formation is associated with fragmentation of the GA, followed by a previously undescribed phenomenon of migration of the organelle into the centers of syncytia. The fragmentation of the GA, however, may occur without the formation of syncytia. Therefore, two distinct mechanisms may be responsible for the fragmentation of the GA and its subsequent migration to the center of syncytia. \u1b67",

Uninfected cells, however, had completely recovered from the BFA effect 16 -24 hr later. These on the morphology and kinetics of coronavirus infection.

In uninfected L2 cells incubated for 1 hr When cells were treated continuously with BFA during infection there was dispersion of the GA, lack of syncytia with 5 mg/ml of BFA, immunostaining with anti-MG-160 showed a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern consistent formation, and no detectable viral titers (Fig. 4) .

However, when the BFA treatment began 12 hr or more after viral infection cells had diffuse staining of the GA when observed 8 hr postinfection as did uninfected cells inoculation, there were relatively minimal effects on syncytia formation, and viral titers were 1-2 logs lower as following a similar treatment with BFA.

Therefore, when cells were infected with MHV-A59 inoculation and continued through the entire infection or 1, 3, or 5 hr after inoculation, there was no significant prior to or at the same time of treatment with BFA, the effect of the drug on the GA was not abolished 16 or effect on the ability of the virus to form syncytia 24 hr by cisternae derived from the intermediate compartment between the ER and the Golgi stacks, thus acquiring two membranes in one step (Sodeik et al., 1993 (Sodeik et al., , 1995 . The second wrapping cisternae in vaccinia virus assembly is derived from the trans Golgi network (Schmelz et al., 1994) . In CMV, ultrastructural as well as biochemical studies suggested that short-term exposure of infected cultures to BFA during the late infectious cycle primarily prevented Golgi-dependent processes, e.g., envelopment of naked cytoplasmic nucleocapsids in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and normal processing of glycoprotein B (Eggers et al., 1992) . In Uukuniemi virus, a member of the bunyaviridae, immunofluorescent staining indicated that G1 glycoprotein expressed alone localized to the GA. G2 expressed alone was associated with the RER (Melin et al., 1995) . Coronavirus MHV M glycoprotein (previously known as E1) is targeted to the GA and contains a retention signal for the GA (Machamer et al., 1990; Swift and Machamer, 1991; Armstrong and Patel, 1991) . Previous reports have shown that the GA undergoes rearrangement (Ho et al., 1990) and fragmentation (Campadelli et al., 1993) in viral infections. The data presented here detail the changes in the morphology of the GA in cells infected by a virus which induces the formation of syncytia. In coronavirus infection, the virus displays Cultures were incubated with virus (\") for 1 hr and exposed to BFA (\u0656) for various periods.

If BFA was introduced after be unique to coronaviruses as it was not associated with or before this stage (4-16 hr), there was no effect on other fusion and syncytia forming viruses such as Sindbis viral replication, assembly, and maturation. These results virus infection (Ho et al., 1990) or herpes simplex virus suggest that the interval of 4-16 hr postinfection is the infection (Campadelli et al., 1993) . Since the aggregation most significant period requiring an intact GA for viral of the fragmented GA in the centers of syncytia has not replication and syncytia formation.
