Of note is the high rate of underlying comorbidity in patients with MERS (table). Since the fi rst cases were reported in April, 2012, from Jordan, most cases have been reported from Saudi Arabia where the Hajj, the largest religious mass gathering, takes place annually. Given the predicted population movements out of Saudi Arabia, potential for worldwide spread of MERS-CoV exists according to Kahn and colleagues. 2 By contrast, Breban and colleagues 3 calculated that the risk of MERS-CoV to have pandemic potential does not exceed 5%, but they did not take into account the eff ect of Hajj mass gathering in their scenario.",

Nevertheless, this spread of resistance probably led to increased use of colistin, the last available antibiotic to which P aeruginosa are susceptible. In turn, this rise in colistin use unsurprisingly resulted in the emergence in 2010 of strains resistant to all available drugs-a situation that could not be much worse.",

Edelstein and colleagues compared patients infected with VIM-2-positive P aeruginosa with those infected with P aeruginosa insusceptible to carbapenems probably by other variable mechanisms of resistance, which are not described. The results did not clearly point to specifi c risks for acquisition of the epidemic strain. The more frequent use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in patients infected with VIM-2-producing strains suggests that such patients were exposed to high-risk procedures or to highrisk units for prolonged periods. In this regard, Edelstein and colleagues' report largely confi rms what was already known. Specifi c control measures are not suggested.",

Was mortality lower in patients infected with non-VIM-2-producing P aeruginosa strains? To what extent mortality was attributable to resistance was not addressed by the authors. More sophisticated epidemiological methods would have been needed to provide an answer. Thus we cannot assess the true clinical consequences of this epidemic.",

At a time when the G8 has issued a statement 2 about their concerns about antimicrobial resistance, clinical epidemiologists have to provide decision makers with quantitative estimates of the resulting medical and economic burdens of disease and eff ects on public health so that appropriate responses can be made. This is the second major warning from Timothy Walsh's group-3 years ago, they reported 3 the dissemination of NDM-1, another potent enzyme that hydrolyses carbapenems. Let's take global action before a third and maybe even worse report of antibiotic resistance. 4 However, we reported rapid acquisition of other respiratory viruses in pilgrims during their stay in Saudi Arabia-most notably, rhinovirus-emphasising the potential of these infections to spread in the pilgrims' home countries on their return. 5 The 2013 mandatory meningococcal vaccination campaign for Hajj was started on Aug 19, at our institution. Early results of the first week show that pilgrims preparing for Hajj this year were younger and less likely to present with comorbidity than in 2012; however, 48% had at least one disorder for which the Saudi MoH recommends to postpone the performance of the Hajj. Although our results cannot be extrapolated to all Hajj pilgrims, they clearly show that a substantial proportion of European pilgrims departing from southern France are unlikely to heed the recommendations set out by the Saudi MoH.",

Such measures have already been highly accepted by pilgrims. 6 The presence of MERS-CoV neutralising anti bodies in dromedary camels in Oman and the Canary Islands might provide a clue as to a potential source for human infection, although the presence of MERS-CoV in camels has not been established. 7 We recently investigated the willingness of French pilgrims to consume raw camel milk if offered during their stay in Saudi Arabia; 41% said that they would drink it if offered. 8 Given that camel milk consumption in the Middle East is associated with several zoonotic infections, we recommend that Hajj pilgrims be cautioned against consuming unpasteurised dairy products. Following recent isolation of MERS-CoV from the faeces of a bat in Saudi Arabia, we recommend people avoid contact with both farm and wild animals. 9 *Philippe Gautret ",
