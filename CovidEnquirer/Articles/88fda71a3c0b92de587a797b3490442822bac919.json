            "text": "A real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the detection of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) RNA in clinical samples is described. The assay is based on TaqMan technology, consisting of two primers and one probe labeled with the reporter dye 6-carboxyfluorescein that binds selectively to the transmembrane-protein gene of BCoV. The BCoV real-time RT-PCR assay was able to detect the tested BCoV and BCoV-like viruses (canine respiratory coronavirus and bubaline coronavirus), whereas other common viral pathogens of cattle were not recognised by the established oligonucleotide set, thus showing that the test was specific for bovine-like CoVs. The detection limit of the assay was 20 BCoV RNA copies (1-log higher with respect to traditional gel-based RT-PCR) and the reproducibility was satisfactory, thus allowing for a sensitive and accurate measurement of the viral RNA load in clinical samples. Two hundred and twenty clinical specimens (92 rectal, 82 nasal and 46 ocular swabs) were subjected to gel-based and real-time RT-PCR. By conventional amplification, 43 rectal, 54 nasal and 34 ocular samples tested positive, whereas the TaqMan assay was able to detect the BCoV nucleic acid in 49 rectal, 60 nasal and 37 ocular swabs. The rapidity and high throughput of the BCoV TaqMan assay makes this method a powerful tool for a sensitive and specific diagnosis of BCoV infection in cattle.",

            "text": "Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is a group 2 coronavirus (CoV) that is responsible for different clinical forms of disease in cattle, including enteritis in newborn calves, \"winter dysentery\" in adult cows, and respiratory signs in calves and cows. The same virus strain could also be responsible for the simultaneous appearance of enteric and respiratory disease in the same animals as well as in calves and cows (Decaro et al., 2008a,b) . It is thought that BCoV is able to cross the species barrier very frequently, giving rise to bovine-like CoVs which can infect different mammals. The bovine origin of some group 2a CoVs has been suggested for viruses such as human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43 (Vijgen et al., 2005) , porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) (Vijgen et al., 2006) , canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) (Erles et al., 2003) and other ruminant CoVs (Hasoksuz et al., 2007; Jin et al., 2007; Decaro et al., 2008c) .",

However, these techniques have been proven to be poorly sensitive and often inconclusive due to the presence of pleomorphic CoV-like particles in clinical samples, virus instability in the environment, time-consuming procedures, or presence of maternally derived antibodies in the faeces (Sato et al., 1977; Dea et al., 1980; Saif, 1990; Sato and Akashi, 1993) . Because of its higher sensitivity and versatility, the detection of viral nucleic acid by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been established as the diagnostic gold standard for a number of infectious diseases. Several reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR-based methods have been developed for the detection and identification of BCoV and BCoV-like RNA in faecal and respiratory specimens of cattle (Tsunemtitsu et al., 1999; Cho et al., 2001; Erles et al., 2003; Takiuchi et al., 2006) . However, none of those RT-PCR assays were designed to be quantitative. In addition, PCR assays are frequently exposed to risks of carryover contamination, especially when a high sample throughput is required.",

When compared with a classical RT-PCR protocol, the processing time required by TaqMan RT-PCR is shorter, the contamination risks are lower because of the lack of post-PCR steps and the specificity is increased by the probe hybridisation. The assay was also able to detect the nucleic acid of bovine-like CoVs (CRCoV and BuCoV). Other BCoV-like CoVs, such as HCoV-OC43 and PHEV, that were not included in our analyses, should be tested in order to assess whether they can be identified by the established assay.

In fact, when the clinical samples collected from affected cattle were processed, real-time RT-PCR was able to detect BCoV RNA in seven rectal, six nasal and three ocular swabs that tested negative by conventional amplification. In contrast, only one faecal sample gave a positive result by gel-based RT-PCR and tested negative by the TaqMan assay. Sequencing of the M gene of this BCoV revealed the presence of two mismatches in the probe-binding region that prevented the correct annealing of the TaqMan probe (data not shown). CoVs are thought to mutate at high frequency like most RNA viruses as a consequence of the high error rates of the RNA polymerase that are predicted to accumulate several base substitutions per round of replication (Jarvis and Kirkegaard, 1991; Lai and Holmes, 2001) . The high strain variability of CoVs has been identified as a limiting factor for efficient PCR amplification of their genomic RNA. For instance, molecular methods to detect all feline calicivirus strains have not yet been developed even when conserved regions of the viral replicase gene complex were chosen as a target for amplification (Marsilio et al., 2005) . In order to reduce false-negative results related to strain variation, TaqMan oligonucleotides were designed in a very conserved region of the M gene. The same gene was taken into account for the design of primer/probe sets which were used in real-time RT-PCR assays for CCoVs, that proved to be very sensitive ensuring correct amplification of strains with different geographic origin (Decaro et al., 2004 .",
