The incidence and characteristics of HMPV have not been well described in pregnant women. As part of a trial of maternal influenza immunization in rural southern Nepal, we conducted prospective, longitudinal, home-based active surveillance for febrile respiratory illness during pregnancy through 6 months postpartum. During 2011-2014, HMPV was detected in 55 of 3,693 women (16.4 cases/1,000 person-years). Twenty-five women were infected with HMPV during pregnancy, compared with 98 pregnant women who contracted rhinovirus and 7 who contracted respiratory syncytial virus. Women with HMPV during pregnancy had an increased risk of giving birth to infants who were small for gestational age. An intervention to reduce HMPV febrile respiratory illness in pregnant women may have the potential to decrease risk of adverse birth outcomes in developing countries.",

Many adults with HMPV infections do not seek medical care, and among those who do, many are not tested for viral infections (11). Walsh et al. followed prospectively enrolled young adults (18-40 years of age), healthy elderly adults (\u226565 years of age), and high-risk adults (those with symptomatic lung disease) over 4 consecutive winters (32) . That study found that 4.3%-10.6% of young adults experienced HMPV infection in any given year, higher than the proportion noted in the healthy elderly (2.2%-6.4%) or the high-risk cohort (2.9%-8.6%), supporting our finding that HMPV is a major pathogen among young adults. These findings also align with the proportion of maternal respiratory swabs positive for HMPV in our study (6.7%), although only 55% of participants in the Walsh et al. young adult cohort reported fever (32) . The HMPV seasonality demonstrated in this subtropical area is somewhat earlier than the seasonality documented in other settings in the Northern Hemisphere, with most cases typically occurring in January through April (2, 4, 6, 11, (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) . Although most research has been done in temperate climate zones, a study from India demonstrated only 1 HMPV peak over the 3-year study period, which suggests that HMPV may exhibit a nonannual cycle in this setting (37) .",

            "text": "We found that febrile illness due to HMPV during pregnancy is associated with increased SGA risk (risk ratio 1.7; p = 0.031). Infants who are born SGA are at increased risk for poor growth and early death, particularly in developing countries. Reasons for SGA births include maternal malnutrition, use of drugs or alcohol during pregnancy, intrauterine infection, maternal anemia, or hypertension during pregnancy (38) . Rates of hypertension, maternal smoking, and alcohol use are low in this cohort, and we found no difference in body mass index between pregnant women with and without SGA births. It is possible that a systemic inflammatory response due to HMPV febrile respiratory illness may be associated with increased risk of SGA, although it is not clear why this would be due to HMPV alone rather than febrile respiratory illness in general. No difference was noted in LBW or PTB between infants born to women with and without HMPV during pregnancy. Overall, the observed incidences of LBW and PTB in this cohort were slightly lower than previous estimates in the region, reflecting an overall improvement in health in the population. Among all women enrolled, 25% gave birth to an LBW infant, compared with 30.4% in previous studies; 13% gave birth preterm, compared with 18.3% in previous studies (15, 39) . In the parent trial of maternal influenza immunization, influenza vaccination during pregnancy was effective in prevention of influenza infection in infants and was also associated with increased birthweight (20) . This finding suggests that prevention of potential respiratory illness during pregnancy may decrease the risk of adverse birth outcomes.",

            "text": "Limitations of this study included the relatively small number of women with HMPV during pregnancy. We observed most outcomes at rates at 10%-50%, but with only 25 women having HMPV during pregnancy, we had the power only to detect risk ratios of 1.6 to 3.5. A further limitation was the collection of swabs only in cases of febrile respiratory illness; asymptomatic or afebrile infections would not have been captured. Because previous studies have found that adults with HMPV are often afebrile, with fever reported among 0-55% of adults, we likely underestimated the true incidence of HMPV (6, 11, 32, 34, 40) . Preceding respiratory viral infections may increase risk for secondary bacterial infections, such as pneumococcus and staphylococcus. Unfortunately, in this study we did not test for bacterial infections and thus cannot assess whether these had an effect on clinical outcomes. The study was confined to a single rural district, which may have limited the variation in risk factors, such as caste and education. However, this region of Nepal (in the plains along the border with Bihar, India) is broadly representative of South Asia, a region with a population density and birth rate among the highest in the world. Few studies of HMPV have been conducted in these types of settings, particularly among pregnant women, which is notable because the presentation and clinical outcomes of disease may differ in regions of the world with high rates of household density, malnutrition, and indoor air pollution.",

These data may help providers to make decisions about therapeutic care, particularly as more inexpensive viral diagnostic tests become available. Finally, as attempts to develop a vaccine or antiviral therapy for HMPV are currently under way, the identification of risk factors for infection and for severe disease is crucial to identify groups that would benefit most from these advances, and to help develop focused prevention strategies.",
