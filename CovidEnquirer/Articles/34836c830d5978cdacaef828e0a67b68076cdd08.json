Duchaine: Technologies of interest will depend on the situation and the point source of microbial contamination, for example, a person coughing in an emergency room, a patient vomiting in a hospital ward, or a student vomiting in a classroom. The intervention of choice must be relevant for the site, for instance, a hospital versus a shopping mall. Portable indoor air decontamination devices may be used in smaller areas, such as classrooms, but devices that would allow global decontamination (eg, at a hospital or a shopping mall) would be more challenging. When possible, routine and continuous air treatment may be better than an on-site intervention.",

One example is the use of UVGI in air circulation ducts if the potentially generated ozone can be effectively removed to avoid its entry into occupied zones. The technology of choice must be safe when people are present, while also being energy efficient. Further, it must not only be effective, but also scalable to suit the site of use. The results of testing in an aerobiology chamber can be much different than those in a large area, such as a hospital or a large shopping mall, where there are on-going changes in the air quality parameters. The debate continues as to whether indoor air for breathing should be treated in the same fashion as water for drinking.",

However, in situations of very close contact between 2 people, it is virtually impossible to prevent exposure to airborne pathogens.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that CFD has been used to assess the design and performance of an aerobiology chamber to test the behavior of microorganisms in indoor air.

            "text": "There are a lot of data for surface disinfection that suggest a general hierarchy of resistance. Do you see the same hierarchy for aerobiological studies? When norovirus is detected in air from a contaminated area, what is the source? It is less likely from direct breathing, but rather from vomit or fecal aerosolization of norovirus. If norovirus is primarily transmitted by touch, then is it important to decontaminate the air if air transmission does not cause infection?Dr Duchaine: The source is the patients themselves. The sampling device was present where the actively emitting patients were, and they may have vomited or had diarrhea. There may be up to 10 12 virus particles per gram of diarrheic feces, and this would be part of the aerosol. Surfaces are cleaned, but if an airborne route exists, this explains how other patients some distance away become infected. One way to prevent spreading of infections is to decontaminate the air. For the first part of your question, droplet nuclei need to come in contact with the product for an appropriate period of time. Unlike surface testing, the air decontaminant contact time is longer.Audience member 5: How do you compare the resistance levels of the different categories of organisms (bacteria, virus, and fungi) in air?Dr Sattar: You need to develop comparative data, but one would expect differences in comparing liquid disinfectants to air treatments. For liquid disinfectants, there is a larger volume to infectious agent ratio. In air, the ratio is not the same, and the testing dynamics are different. Therefore, one cannot compare liquid disinfection testing to air decontamination. There is a need to consider surrogate organisms for each of the 5 categories because there are practical and ethical issues to deal with in working with actual pathogens. For example, M [Mycobacterium] tuberculosis can spread by air, but it is a relatively slow-growing pathogen and difficult to obtain in viability titers high enough for aerosolization. Also, how can we grow enough of the SARS virus to contaminate an aerobiology chamber? If regulators allow the use of surrogate organisms for testing environmental surface disinfectants, why can their use not be extended to air testing?Audience member 7: We should not limit ourselves to key pathogens, such as respiratory, as less known ones can become a problem. Could infection or airflow be modeled through adjoining rooms or halls, rather than in a chamber? That might be beneficial to better align with the real world.Dr Zargar: Modeling of a furnished chamber can be used as the starting point for simulation of a hospital room. Modeling of the ventilation system in any such setting would be crucial.Audience member 2: Following up on the hierarchy question, AD [Antimicrobial Division of the U.S. EPA] for registration purposes allowed 60% glycol products to have an air sanitization claim. Data are required to support this, so registrants must provide the data. This testing is in its infancy. As more data become available, a hierarchy for air decontamination can be developed. Selecting surrogates also is still in its infancy and currently is supported by historical selection.Mr Rubino: It is time to close the session, and I would like to thank ASTM International for supporting this workshop. Special thanks to Dr Sattar, Dr Mitchell, Dr Ijaz, and the rest of the team, as well as to the speakers.",
