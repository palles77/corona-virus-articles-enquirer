S1). Analysis of the receptor binding motif (RBM), a portion of the receptor binding domain 87 (RBD) that makes contact with ACE2, revealed that most amino acid residues essential for ACE2 88 binding were conserved in 2019-nCoV-S but not in the S proteins of SARSr-CoV previously 89 found not to use ACE2 for entry (Fig. 2B). In agreement with these findings, directed expression 90 of human and bat ACE2 but not human DPP4, the entry receptor used by MERS-CoV (20), or 91 human APN, the entry receptor used by HCoV-229E (21), allowed 2019-nCoV-S-and SARS-S-92 driven entry into otherwise non-susceptible BHK-21 cells (Fig. 2C), indicating that 2019-nCoV-S 93 like SARS-S uses ACE2 for cellular entry.",

For initial insights into 2019-nCoV-S protease choice, 101 we employed ammonium chloride, which elevates endosomal pH and thereby blocks CatB/L 102 activity. Ammonium chloride treatment blocked VSV-G-driven entry into both cell lines studied 103 while entry driven by the Nipah virus F and G proteins was not affected (Fig. 3A), in keeping 104 with expectations. Moreover, ammonium chloride treatment strongly inhibited 2019-nCoV-S-105 and SARS-S-driven entry into TMPRSS2 -293T cells while inhibition of entry into TMPRSS2 + 106 Caco-2 cells was less efficient, which would be compatible with 2019-nCoV-S priming by 107 TMPRSS2 in Caco-2 cells. Indeed, the serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate, which is 108 active against TMPRSS2 (24), efficiently blocked 2019-nCoV-S-driven entry into Caco-2 109 (TMPRSS2 + ) but not 293T (TMPRSS2 -) cells while the CatB/L inhibitor E64d had the opposite 110 effect(Fig. 3B).

Moreover, it is noteworthy that ACE2 expression is not limited 124 to the lung and that extrapulmonary spread of SARS-CoV in ACE2 + tissues was observed (29, 125 30). The same can be expected for 2019-nCoV, although affinity of SARS-S and 2019-nCoV-S 126 for ACE2 remains to be compared. 127 Priming of coronavirus S proteins by host cell proteases is essential for viral entry into 128 cells and protease choice can determine zoonotic potential (31).
