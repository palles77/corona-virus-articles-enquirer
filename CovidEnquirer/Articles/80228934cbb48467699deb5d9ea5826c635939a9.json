Intuitively, this million-year claim seems dubious. I questioned the equation used in the Fouchier calculation and the extremely low probability of escape that he employed in the calculation, and I outlined an alternative approach (4).

The probability (P 1 \u03ed 0.0001) is 20 times lower and is an estimate for differences between BSL3 and BSL3\u03e9 labs. The final probability (P 1 \u03ed 1 \u03eb 10 \u03ea6 ) is Fouchier's estimate (3) . To make his estimate, Fouchier itemizes the various safety measures in his lab and generously reduces the probability for each safety measure but admits that it is a guess: \"the magnitude of this increase in safety is not known.\" Finally, the discussion here of probabilities has been restricted to LAIs, but there are other routes of escape, such as mechanical failure and removal of live virus from BSL3\u03e9 containment accidentally or for hostile purposes.",

This would lead to an intolerable number of fatalities even using Fouchier's low P 1 estimate. Potential fatalities for the enterprise and the fatality burden for each lab in the enterprise were quantified for his very low P 1 of 1 \u03eb 10 -6 in my published criticism (4) of Fouchier's million-year calculation.

Although biosecurity measures have improved greatly over the years, human nature has not.

For a wide range of R o values, Lipsitch and coworkers have calculated the probability of uncontrolled spread (see Fig. 4a in their study [9] ). For a single infected individual with an R o of 2, the probability of an uncontrolled outbreak ranges from 10% (spread of R o s) to 80% (uniform R o ). Thus, the pandemic likelihood from a single infected individual is potentially large.
