Level D personal protective equipment should be worn: Disposable gloves and a laboratory gown should be worn at all times when handling specimens, and a dental mask and goggles should be worn when there is a risk of splashing from opening the specimen container (glasses are insufficient, and so goggles or a facial shield should be worn on top of glasses). After testing has been completed, all protective equipment should be removed and hands should be washed before leaving the testing area. When removing the protective equip-ment, care must be taken not to contaminate the hands and body; an N95 mask should be worn when there is a high risk of aerosol production. ii. Class II biosafety cabinet (BSC): A laboratory gown (long sleeves, covering the whole body, opening at the back) and disposable gloves must be worn. After completing work at the BSC, hands must be washed after removing gloves. iii. Other safety devices -Use of safety equipment installed by the manufacturer e.g.) Centrifuge double cover When infectious specimens are centrifuged, the specimen should be loaded and unloaded from the bucket and rotor inside the BSC. b. When handling specimens outside the BSC, minimize unintended contact with the specimen. c. After work on the specimen has been completed, the BSC is sterilized with 70% alcohol. d. Any objects that contact the infectious specimen should be disposable if possible, and if they become contaminated by the specimen, they need to be autoclaved before disposal. 7) Specimen handling during common tests (biochemical, hematological, and other tests) a. When hematological or biochemical tests are performed using blood, serum, or urine specimens, standard precautions should be taken, as with any ordinary clinical specimen. b. Use a BSC when producing smears (cytospin, etc.) or counting the number of cells in bodily fluids other than blood (e.g. BAL). c. Respiratory specimens and other body fluids (including feces) are infectious specimens, and must be processed at a class II biosafety cabinet. d. Tests that should be performed in standard precaution i. Pathological tests of tissue that has been fixed in formalin or inactivated by another method ii. Molecular tests using nucleic acid extract iii. Examination using an electron microscope after fixation in glutaraldehyde iv. Testing bacterial and fungal cultures in a microbial laboratory v.

Diagnostic tests for infectious specimens, other than isolation or culturing of MERS-CoV iv. Nucleic acid extraction from infectious specimens v. When producing smears for microscopic observation, specimens should only be moved outside BSC after inactivation of MERS-CoV by chemical or heat fixation. * Take care that neither the devices nor the bench inside the BSC are contaminated, and in the case of contamination, decontamination must be performed. e.g.) Dangerous actions -specimen pipetting (use filter tips or disposal droppers), specimen splitting and dilution (an absorbent, non-permeable mat must be used when moving specimen to the bench), excessive or rapid force during pipetting (to-deliver types are safer than to-contain types), disposing of disposable pipette tips in a waste container holding an antiseptic solution (the waste container should be used inside the BSC), using syringes (do not use if possible), burning (burners and alcohol lamps should not be used), writing (no writing is allowed inside the BSC) * BSC decontamination: Fumigation must be performed when the filter needs to be changed. f. Isolation or culturing of MERS-CoV requires BL3 equipment and protocols. 8) Environmental infection control a. All waste materials contaminated with infectious specimen, test tubes, pipette tips, and other disposable items are collected in a Y-bag, taped, and autoclaved before disposal. Syringes and needles are placed in a medical waste container, and collected and incinerated by a certified waste management company, in accordance with the Wastes Control Act. b. Contaminated disposable items are placed in a Y-bag immediately, in the place that they were used. c. Sterilization method: At least 15 minutes at 121\u00b0C, 1 atm, by autoclave d. Environmental surfaces (devices, surfaces of objects, etc.) contaminated with blood, body fluids, secretions, or excrement i. Disinfectants : 70% alcohol or 0.5% sodium hypochlorite ii. Specimens of feces or body fluids are disposed through the sewage system, in accordance with sewage regulations.iii. When disposing of liquid waste, care must be taken that it does not splash. 9) In the case of contact with infectious respiratory specimens from an infected patient without the proper protective equipment against aerosols, the KCDC guideline to treat the person who contact with confirmed case is followed e.g.) Spillage accident, specimen splashing onto an unprotected face during processing ",
