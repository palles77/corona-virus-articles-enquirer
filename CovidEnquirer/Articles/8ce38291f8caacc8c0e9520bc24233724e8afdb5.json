The 106 patients were divided into two groups according to the serious condition of the diseases. The pattern (consolidation, ground-glass, nodules, and reticulation), distribution, and extent of abnormality on the HRCT were evaluated in both groups. The dates of the onset of symptoms of the patients were recorded. Results: The predominant CT findings in the patients at presentation were unilateral or bilateral multifocal asymmetric ground-glass opacities alone (n = 29, 27.4%), with unilateral or bilateral consolidation (n = 50, 47.2%). The consolidation had peribronchovascular and subpleural predominance. The areas of consolidation were found mainly in the posterior, middle and lower regions of the lungs. Reticular opacities were found in 6 cases of the initial MDCT scan. The extent of disease was greater in group 1 patients requiring advanced mechanical ventilation, with diffuse involvement in 19 patients (63.3%) of group 1 patients, and only 15/76 (19.7%) of group 2 patients (p < 0.01, 2 test). 20 cases (19%) of the 106 patients had small bilateral or unilateral pleural effusions. None had evidence of hilar or mediastinal lymph node enlargement on CT performed at admission or later. Conclusions: The most common radiographic and CT findings in patients with S-OIV infection are unilateral or bilateral ground-glass opacities with or without associated focal or multifocal areas of consolidation. On HRCT, the ground-glass opacities had a predominant peribronchovascular and subpleural distribution. CT plays an important role in the early recognition of severe S-OIV (H1N1).",

It is therefore important that clinicians and radiologists be able to recognize chest CT findings of H1N1 influenza in high-risk groups so that they order specific antiviral therapy as soon as possible, especially in the countryside without appropriate diagnostic tests to confirm the diseases [3] . Multi-slice CT (MSCT) is the best technique to detect the early pneumonia compared with other techniques. In this article, we review initial HRCT findings characteristics of 106 patients who were hospitalized for pneumonia with presumed/laboratory-confirmed novel S-OIV (H1N1) in order to detect pneumonia with H1N1 earlier.",

The other patients had no CT scans but bedside anteroposterior-projection radiographs because their serious condition. The studies were performed on a 10-MDCT scanner (Sensation10, Siemens Healthcare) or 16-MCT scanner (lightspeed 16, GE Healthcare). The protocol used was as follows: end-inspiratory acquisition, 120 kV, 150-200 mA s, and 2-mm reformation. The images were viewed on both lung (window width, 1400 HU; level, \u2212700 HU) and mediastinal (window width, 350 HU; level, 40 HU) settings. The reconstructions were made in 2 mm-slice-thick and lung settings. 26 of the initial CT scans were obtained using a variety of CT scanners and protocols at other hospitals before the patients were transferred to our hospital.

The abnormalities were further characterized as consolidation, groundglass opacity, nodules, and reticulation. Ground-glass opacities were defined as hazy areas of increased opacity or attenuation without obscuration of the underlying vessels. Consolidation was defined as homogeneous opacification of the parenchyma with obscuration of the underlying vessels. Nodular opacities were defined as focal round opacities. Reticular opacities were defined as linear opacities forming a meshlike pattern. The involvement was categorized as unilateral or bilateral. If the involvement was deemed bilateral, the process was categorized as symmetric or asymmetric in nature. The distribution was categorized as focal, multifocal, and diffuse. Focal was defined as a single focus of abnormality, multifocal as more than one focus, and diffuse if bilateral and involving the equivalent of the volume of one or both lungs. Predominant distribution was also assessed as being in the upper, middle, or lower lung zone and as being in a random, predominantly central or peribronchovascular, or peripheral (outer third of the lungs) location. The presence of associated hilar, mediastinal lymph node enlargement, or pleural abnormalities was also assessed. Any additional lung findings were recorded. To assess changes that occurred over time, the CT scans in some patient were examined in sequence. The pattern, extent, and distribution of abnormal CT findings were compared with findings in the same region on previous and subsequent CT scans. The date of the onset of symptoms and the date of the earliest CT scans of all the patients were recorded. We evaluated the interval days that between the onset of the symptom and the initial CT scans.",

None of our patients with H1N1 had normal CT findings at presentation. The HRCT findings at presentation in our patients were similar to those described by the reports [6] . The predominant radiographic findings in the patients at presentation were unilateral or bilateral multifocal asymmetric ground-glass opacities alone (n = 29, 27.4%), with unilateral or bilateral consolidation (n = 50, 49.2%), nodular opacities or reticular opacities ( Table 1 ). The initial MDCT scan displayed a pattern of rounded, multiple, peripheral ill-defined ground-glass opacities, including two patients who are pregnant ( Figs. 1 and 2) . The sharp demarcation between the areas of involved and uninvolved parenchyma can been seen on CT scans. The consolidation had peribronchovascular and subpleural predominance. The areas of consolidation were found mainly in the posterior, middle and lower regions of the lungs, but there was no difference between the two groups (Table 1) . Reticular opacities were found in 6 cases of the initial MDCT scan (Fig. 3) . There was no difference between the pattern of disease of the two groups ( Table 2 ).

The one patient in group 1 who had focal disease involving only unilateral lower zones was admitted to ICU for dyspnea and died after 2 days. On CT scans, swelling of brain stem and bilateral thalamus were found (Fig. 6 ).

The modes of transmission of influenza viruses in humans, including S-OIV, are thought to occur mainly through the dissemination of large droplets and possibly small-particle droplet expelled when an infected person coughs [7, 8] . The most common clinical findings at presentation are fever, cough, dyspnea, and respiratory distress [7] . Although most cases of swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV) have been self-limited, fatal cases raise questions about virulence and radiology's role in early detection. Frequently reported complications of H1N1 influenza have included pneumonia, bacterial coinfection, acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) and exacerbation of underlying medical conditions, such as congestive heart failure. The majority of fatal outcomes in the United States have been related to pulmonary complications [9, 10] .",

The histologic changes of pneumonia in H1N1 are characteristics of influenza though not pathognomonic. Autopsies have shown that the main pathological changes associated with S-OIV infection are localized to the lungs [11] . The lungs typically show diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) [12] . In the early phase of the disease (<10 to 12 days), features of the exudative inflammatory phase of diffuse alveolar damage are predominant. There are hyaline membranes, alveolar septal edema, hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes and fibrin thrombus in the vascular lumen. That is corresponding with ground-glass opacities and consolidations on CT scans. The following additional histopathological features have also been reported: inflammatory infiltrate below the endothelium and partial loss and adherence of the endothelium in intrapulmonary blood vessels; pneumonia foci with intraalveolar exudates without evidence of bacterial colonies [12] ; necrotizing bronchiolitis [11] ; extensive hemorrhage [11] ; pleuritis; interstitial pneumonitis; cytopathic effect in the bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells and epithelial hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia of the large airways [13] . In cases with longer disease duration, changes consistent with the fibrous proliferative phase (organizing diffuse alveolar damage) and the final fibrotic stage (interstitial fibrosis) have been observed [14] . One contributing factor for death in our patients may have been delayed admission and delayed initiation of oseltamivir or mechanical ventilation. Possible mechanisms of damage include direct injury to the respiratory epithelium with a secondary cytokine storm [2] . 5 . A-34-year-old man with laboratory-confirmed S-OIV (H1N1). Chest CT acquired at admission (3 days after symptom onset) showed a peripheral distribution of patchy ground-glass opacities (A). With progression of the symptoms, chest radiograph obtained 2 days after hospital admission (B) showed bilateral areas of consolidation in mid and lower lung zones. He was admitted to ICU on the same day for mechanical ventilation. The ground-glass opacities were located throughout the upper and lower regions of all lobes in a peribronchovascular distribution. CT scan obtained on the third days after A (C) showed diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities, areas of consolidation predominately in subpleural and dependent lung regions. Fig. 6 . A 5-year-old girl with laboratory-confirmed S-OIV (H1N1). Chest CT scan obtained 6 h after the onset of fever showed focal ground-glass opacities in right lower lobe (A).

An interesting observation on the HRCT scans was the distinctive peribronchovascular and peripheral distribution of the disease. This appearance is similar to that seen in cases of organizing pneumonia. The similarity of typi-cal CT findings in cases of S-OIV and in cases of early severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been previously raised [17, 18] . We also noted that similarity in our group of patients. During the initial phases of both diseases the virus cause exudative inflammatory alveolar and interstitial edema that result in both MDCT finding dominated by ground-glass opacities (GGO) [18] . Severe cases can develop radiologic and pathologic findings of diffuse alveolar damage rapidly and the patients present with hemoptysis, even acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [19] . In addition, both diseases showed no centrilobular nodules, tree-in-bud pattern, cavity, pleural effusion, or mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy [20] . However, 19% of the patients with pleural effusion were found in our group of patients. The absence of centrolobular and treein-bud opacities further decreases the suggestion of bronchiolitis and small-airway inflammation at the level of the secondary lobule. Radiologic recovery from H1N1 can be complete, but computed tomography images often show persistent GGO and reticular opacities, some of which reflect pathologic findings of fibrosis. Long-term follow-up imaging of survivors shows gradual decrease of GGO and reticulation with persistent air trapping in some patients. The latter is evidence of small-airway disease that cannot be detected on CT scans at the onset of the disease [19] .",
