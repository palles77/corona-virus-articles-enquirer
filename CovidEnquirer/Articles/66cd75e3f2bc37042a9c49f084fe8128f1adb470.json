Five experimental diets were formulated to provide 40% crude protein and 11% dietary lipid (dry matter basis) with the yeast-based protein source replacing Special Select\u00ae menhaden fish meal at 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of dietary protein. Ten juvenile cobia (initial weight 11.5 g/fish) were randomly stocked in triplicate 300 l circular fiberglass tanks (n = 30 treatment \u2212 1 ) and hand-fed the diets based upon total tank biomass two times daily at 0900 and 1400 h. Fish were group weighed weekly to monitor performance and adjust feeding rations. Water temperature and salinity were maintained at 27\u00b0C and 15\u2030, respectively. At the end of the feeding trial, weight gain, ranging from 86% to 512%, and feed conversion ratio values, ranging from 1.9 to 5.8, were significantly affected by the inclusion of the yeast-based protein source, with decreasing values as inclusion levels of the yeast-based protein source rose above 25% of dietary protein. Cobia fed the diet containing 25% of dietary protein from the yeastbased protein source had equal weight gain and feed conversion ratio values as fish fed the control diet composed of 100% fish meal (503 vs. 512 and 1.9 vs. 1.9, respectively). Biological indices including hepatosomatic index, visceral somatic index and muscle ratio were all similarly affected by inclusion of the yeast-based protein source, with significant impacts when inclusion levels rose above 25% of dietary protein. As with the weight gain and feed efficiency ratio values, fish fed the diet containing 25% of protein from the yeast-based source had similar values as those observed in the control animals.",

            "text": "Fish meal is generally considered to represent the \"gold standard\" dietary protein source for carnivorous fishes. However, even though the animal feedstuffs and competing industries have increased demands for fish meal, global production of this commodity has remained relatively stable over the last decade, and supplies are unlikely to improve (FAO, 2004) . Indeed, the increasing scarcity of suitable protein sources for human consumption may result in the use of industrial fish for the plate Aquaculture 257 (2006) 393 -399 www.elsevier.com/locate/aqua-online resulting in a further weakening in supplies (Craig and McLean, 2005) . Already, aquafeeds account for N 50% of variable operating costs of intensive aquaculture operations, with protein representing the most costly feed ingredient (Bassompierre et al., 1997) . If aquaculture is to continue to expand to meet global demands for seafood products, development of cost-effective and sustainable dietary formulations will be mandatory (Catacutan and Pagador, 2004) . This only can occur through significant reductions in the dependence of the aquafeed industry upon fish meal supplies. Because fish meal represents a finite resource and as it has become more expensive over time (FAO, 2004) , it is not surprising to find that the aquafeed industry has sought out alternative, less expensive, protein sources. For alternative or supplemental proteins to be useful however, they must possess certain characteristics. Alternative proteins must be competitively priced relative to fish meal on a unit protein basis. They cannot negatively impact fish performance (digestibility, growth, disease resistance, etc.) or product quality and must be commodities (i.e., traded internationally) (Hardy and Tacon, 2002) . As well, alternative proteins must not be environmentally degrading with respect to nitrogen and phosphorus discharge and should be easily handled, stored and amenable to pelleting. Due to the aforementioned restrictions, there exists, at present at least, only a limited number of potential candidates. These include the pulses, oilseeds, grains, rendered animal meals, processing discards and fishery by-catch. Soybean meal in particular represents one of the most widely used alternate protein sources employed by aquaculture, due to its global distribution, cost, relatively high digestibility, good amino acid profile and high protein content (Storebakken et al., 2000) . Nevertheless, soybean and other alternative protein meals each contain a variety of anti-nutritional factors that negatively impact production performance of cultured fish (Francis et al., 2001) .",

            "text": "An issue of more recent concern relates to that of biosecurity and food safety. Western consumers have, due to enhanced education and increased access to scientific and media services, become more sophisticated in their purchasing decisions. In an age of bioterrorist threat, outbreak of unusual z\u00f6onoses (e.g., transmissible bovine spongiform encephalitis, severe acute respiratory syndrome), increasing health concerns related to chemical contaminants (Hites et al., 2004) and the advent of genetically modified organisms, more attention than ever before is being given to food quality and safety (Reid et al., 2004) . This shift in consumer eating patterns has stimulated production of organic foods. As of the early 1980s, aquaculture represented the world's fastestgrowing food production sector. However, since 1999, for many countries organic agriculture has supplanted aquaculture's position as the leading food production growth industry (FAO, 1999; El-Hage Scialabba and Hattam, 2002) . This trend continues on a global basis and includes a growing organic aquaculture segment. Interest in organic aquaculture is based primarily upon the potential profitability of the organic sector (Craig and McLean, 2005) . Although no official statistics are available with respect to organic aquaculture production, estimates suggest that in 2000 it did not exceed 5000 tons, which represents 0.01% of global aquaculture output (Bergleiter, 2001) . This negligible quantity of certified aquaproduce underscores the difficulties inherent in achieving organic aquaculture standards. The principal problem encountered relates to sourcing organic feed and nutrient resources (Tacon and Pruder, 2001) . Based on current estimates of certified organic aquaculture production and anticipated growth of the industry, it has been predicted that organic aquaculture harvests will achieve 1.2 million tons by 2030 (El-Hage Scialabba and Hattam, 2002) . If such an increase is to be realized however, new sources of certifiable feeds must be found. The search for organically certified alternate proteins, especially for carnivorous species, represents a greater challenge than securing alternative proteins alone. The present study was initiated with this in mind. The carnivorous cobia was used as an experimental animal whereas organically certified yeast-based proteins were employed as the alternative protein source.",

Debate continues to surround the certifiability of by-catch from commercial fisheries, as well as by-products and processing wastes from aquaculture, fish and meat processing industries as organic aquafeed ingredients. Moreover, questions remain regarding the palatability and amino acid avail-ability of such products (Li et al., 2004a) . Challenges also are met when considering vegetable protein sources, especially for use in feeds for higher level carnivores such as cobia. Most plant proteins harbor anti-nutritional factors and have low biological value due to essential amino acid deficiencies and/or imbalances and poor digestibility (Hardy, 1996; Francis et al., 2001) . These issues may be amplified with organically certified plant proteins where delayed field operations, poor soil moisture, competition by weeds, and reduced mineralization of organically certified manures throughout a growing season, may each severely impact crop production and quality. Moreover the risks of contamination of organic crops, especially for grains and pulses, by traditional and genetically modified harvests, are of serious concern (Hanson et al., 2004) . The use of fermentation technologies for the production of single cellbased products surmounts all the preceding problems besides providing a totally biosecure production environment.",

            "text": "The present investigation demonstrates that, at a minimum, 25% of the fish meal component in cobia diets can effectively be replaced by the yeast-based protein source utilized in the present study without any negative consequences to animal performance. Concurrently, these studies represent the first demonstration of fish meal replacement with an organically certified alternate protein in cobia feeds. It is highly likely that the level of this yeast-based protein source could be increased substantially since cobia production characteristics only began to decrease following 50% inclusion rate of the yeast-based protein source. These results are thereby similar to observations for other species of juvenile carnivorous fish in which fish meal was replaced using yeast-based products by 30-50% without negative impact (Beck et al., 1976; Rumsey et al., 1990; Oliva-Teles and Goncalves, 2001) . Only two other studies have examined fish meal replacement in cobia diets; both used traditional soybean meal and were able to achieve 40% substitution without detrimental effects upon cobia weight gain and feed conversion (Chou et al., 2004 : Wang et al., 2005 . Juvenile cobias fed the diet containing 100% of dietary protein from the yeast-based protein source were severely compromised with respect to all production and biological parameters examined, returning low weight gain response, reduced FCR values and poor survival. One reason underlying the decreased performance of animals fed the 100% yeast-based diet was most likely product palatability. It was observed that there was a significant amount of feed remaining in the tanks assigned to the 100% yeast-based diet after feeding. Although feed intake was not directly measured, this observation indicates that palatability was poor in this diet. Additionally, amino acid analysis of the diets did not indicate a severe nutrient deficiency with respect to essential amino acids such as lysine and methionine. Likewise, the significantly reduced biological indices (lower VSI, HSI, muscle and liver lipid) in fish fed this diet can be attributed to their extremely low growth rates. It appears that for cobia and other marine carnivores, a blend of alternate protein sources will be required if fish meal is to be effectively replaced without negative impact upon production performance (Craig and McLean, 2005) . Another feature of dietary yeasts and yeast products are their immunostimulating properties. A wide variety of studies, with a broad range of species, have illustrated enhanced non-specific immune activity, particularly under conditions of immuno-depression and environmental stress (Lara-Flores et al., 2002; Olvera-Nova et al., 2002; Li and Gatlin, 2004; Li et al., 2004b; McLean and Craig, 2004; Bagni et al., 2005; Choudhury et al., 2005) . While immune response was not specifically tested in the present study, the significantly heightened plasma protein concentrations observed in cobia fed the diet containing 25% of dietary protein from the yeastbased protein source may indicate a beneficial immunological impact of inclusion of this product in aquafeeds for cobia. It is noteworthy that this species demonstrates elevated hematocrit levels, an obvious indicator of the high metabolic activity, and thus, rapid growth, observed in cobia.",
