Firstly, Nepal is an emerging tourist destination and 2020 has been declared \"Visit Nepal\" year with an expected 500,000 tourists. Among the total number of tourists in 2018, 153633, the second-highest number, were Chinese tourists, with the highest influx during February and December. 6 COVID-19 outbreak coincides (similar to SARS) with Chinese new year during which the Chinese travel extensively, increasing chances for transmission. 7 Study into coronavirus infections in Nepal, has shown the incidence to be higher in winter (December-February). 8 Furthermore, Nepal shares northern border with China with several border crossing points. Several Nepalese students study in China and in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.",

The infected 32-year-old male had returned on January 9 to spend winter holidays in Nepal. He had prior knowledge about the outbreak in China and visited the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH) in Kathmandu on January 13. 3 Taking into account his travel history, he was isolated and was given supportive treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The throat swab sample of the person was sent to the WHO Collaborating Center, Hong Kong and was tested positive. There weren't any complications, except for a surge in temperature to 102\u00b0F on January 14, which then subsided on January 16. Upon clinical improvement, he was discharged on January 17, with a total 4 days in isolation. On January 25, the test results came back confirming COVID-19, although the man had been discharged. He was requested to remain under self-quarantine. Negative results for COVID-19 were given by consecutive follow-up tests on January 29 and 31. 9 Currently, Nepal, under the leadership of the Ministry of Health and Population, has taken various steps to prevent COVID-19. Monitoring teams and health desks have been established at major border check-points and cities such as Kathmandu, Lumbini, Chitwan, Pokhara, Bhairahawa and Ilam. 3 24-hour-operating health desk has been established at the Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA), Kathmandu (the only international airport in Nepal) to screen incoming persons with infrared thermometers along with a dedicated ambulance service to promptly transport suspected cases. 3 Any person with fever (>100\u00b0F), cough or shortness of breath are referred to STIDH. However, the sensitivity of such screening has not been assessed and its effectiveness could be reduced by asymptomatic cases. 10 To curb this issue, focus could be diverted towards improving awareness among travelers about the symptoms of COVID-19 and the algorithm to follow thereafter. Considering the possibility of travel of infected cases, high vigilance coupled with a strong response plan is required to address the current risk of COVID-19. In this regard, a directive Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jtm/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/jtm/taaa024/5762315 by guest on 12 March 2020 from the Government of Nepal is vital for educating the public to respond to the outbreak through necessary precautions and inform travelers about possible risk. Likewise, it is necessary to identify and contain suspected cases from the site of origin for which the capacity of the primary health system needs to be strengthened. COVID-19 and past outbreak scenarios should be a learning experience for Nepal not only on emergency management but also towards developing a strong surveillance system and taking preventive actions for similar events in the future.",
