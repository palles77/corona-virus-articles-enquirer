We constructed a human behavior integrated hierarchical (HiHi) model based on the SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, and Recovered) model, the Wells-Riley equation, and population movement considering both spatial and temporal dimensions. The model considers more than 7 million people, 3 million indoor environments, and 2566 public transport routes in Hong Kong. Smallpox, which could be spread through airborne routes, is studied as an example. The simulation is based on people's daily commutes and indoor human behaviors, which were summarized by mathematical patterns. We found that 59.6%, 18.1%, and 13.4% of patients become infected in their homes, offices, and schools, respectively. If both work stoppage and school closure measures are taken when the number of infected people is greater than 1000, an infectious disease will be effectively controlled after 2 months. The peak number of infected people will be reduced by 25% compared to taking no action, and the time of peak infections will be delayed by about 40 days if 90% of the infected people go to hospital during the infectious period. When ventilation rates in indoor environments increase to five times their default settings, smallpox will be naturally controlled. Residents of Kowloon and the north part of Hong Kong Island have a high risk of infection from airborne infectious diseases. Our HiHi model reduces the calculation time for infection rates to an acceptable level while preserving accuracy.",

The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic affected about 30 countries and resulted in 8422 cases and 916 deaths globally between November 1, 2002, and August 7, 2003 [1] . According to the data provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), from April 12, 2009 , to April 10, 2010, approximately 60.8 million H1N1 cases and 12,469 deaths occurred in the United States [2] . The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) also causes severe respiratory illness with a high case-fatality rate in humans [3] . As of July 21, 2017, it had attacked 27 countries and induced 2040 cases, including at least 712 deaths [4] . Viral or bacterial respiratory infections are the cause of more than 10% of the 6 million global annual deaths [5] . Hong Kong has a high population density and has been badly affected by SARS [6] , H1N1 [7] , and H7N9 [8] . For example, from November 1, 2002, to August 7, 2003 , approximately 20.8% of the global SARS cases and 32.8% of the SARS deaths occurred in Hong Kong [9] . Therefore, a study of airborne infectious disease transmission at the city level in Hong Kong can provide information that the local government needs to plan for, and deal with, emergencies.",

Simulation of infectious disease transmission based on mathematical models such as SIR [10] , SEIS [11] , SIRS [12] , SEIR [13] , and complex networks [14] is generally very fast, but these models do not reflect micro-patterns such as personal contact, which are essential for studying the effects of intervention at the personal and building levels. Models based on human behavior use simulated human activity at hourly intervals to calculate infection probabilities [15, 16] , but are significantly limited by computational power. Most studies of human behavior and infectious disease transmission have focused on a single space, such as a hospital [17] , a cruise ship [18] , or an office [19] . The total population considered in these studies is usually no more than 50,000; when the total population in a study is several million, it is very computationally complex to simulate all human behavior that occurs in many different indoor environments. are to be simulated [20] . However, if we combine these two types of models, most of their disadvantages can be solved and simulations can be accurately conducted within an acceptable amount of time.",

We constructed a human behavior integrated hierarchical (HiHi) model to simulate airborne infectious disease transmission in Hong Kong, which has more than 7 million people, 2.5 million homes, 700,000 offices, 30,000 classrooms, 30,000 restaurants, 54 hospitals, and 2566 public transportation routes. For indoor environments, the simulation accounts for human behaviors and considers transmission patterns in a typical home, office, school, restaurant, hospital, and on public transportation. To reduce computer storage requirements, we determined mathematical patterns for indoor infectious disease transmission in each different type of indoor environment. Airborne infectious disease transmission at a city level was then simulated by combining mathematical equations for locations at a more granular scale (building and room) with daily human behavior.",

According to the known progression of smallpox infection, the latent period is the initial 11.6 days and the infectious period lasts from day 11.6 to day 32.39, including the first 2.49 days of the symptomatic period [28] . Infected people usually show symptoms during the infectious period, at which point the majority either go to hospital or stay home until they have recovered. We assumed that 50% of infected patients go to hospital, 45% stay at home, and the rest make no changes in their behavior [20] . This study extrapolates common human behavior in rooms and buildings in a city. If a simulation included all human behavior in every indoor environment, the calculation time would be unacceptably large. Because most human behavior that occurs in a room, a building, or even a city is fairly regular, infection in an indoor environment can be well represented by a mathematical pattern. Fig. 2 shows how a mathematical model and behavioral model are combined in this study. At each scale, personal attributes, indoor environment variables, human behavior, and infection probability at the lower scale of a room or a building are simulated as input values, and the output value \"Infection Probability (P)\" is then summarized as a mathematical pattern that can be imported into the higher scale. In this study, the infection probability is defined as the probability of a person being infected in 1 h. In Fig. 2 , using buildings as an example, P 2 , which is the infection probability in the building, is calculated from four primary indices: infection probability at the lower scale (room) (P\u2032), personal attributes (P R ), indoor environment variable (E R ), and human behavior in a room (B R ). Personal attributes include resistance (age and gender); indoor environment variables include total population and population density in a building, ventilation, hygiene, temperature, humidity, and building size (number of floors, offices/classes, public rooms including conference rooms and toilets); and human behavior includes the frequency of visits to public rooms, visits to other offices/ classes, wearing of a mask, and hand washing. Based on these secondary indices, we can simulate airborne infectious disease transmission in a particular indoor environment, and an infection probability can be obtained. For example, there are millions of buildings in Hong Kong. Each building has fewer than hundreds of rooms, and each room has fewer than hundreds of people. Based on this method, the calculation time can be drastically reduced if the simulation can be hierarchically classified.",

The \"same block\" percentage for the Home and School category (the probability that a person has a home address and a school address in the same block) is much higher than that for the Home and Office category. In other words, students are more likely to go to school in the block in which they live than adults are to work in the block in which they live. In addition, Hong Kong Island and Kowloon have a higher concentration of offices and schools than the Outlying Islands.

Time spent at an office or a school is from 9:00 to 13:00 and 14:00 to 18:00, with lunchtime from 13:00 to 14:00. People will travel to and from their homes on foot or by bicycle, private car, or public transportation based on the distance between, and the location of, their homes, offices, and KSUs (the detailed selective mode is introduced below). At 13:00, the people who work in offices and study in KSUs will have lunch in a nearby restaurant or canteen. After 18:00, everyone is assumed to go home. \u2022 In China, people spend about 90% of their time indoors [33] .

In the work stoppage and school closure scenarios, the peak number of infected population is about 1.6 million or 2.6 million, respectively, and transmission is partially controlled. Work stoppage is a more efficient control of infectious disease transmission than school closure. If necessary, both work stoppages and school closures can be put in place, as shown by the green line in Fig. 5 . In this case, the transmission is controlled naturally and the peak number of infected people is never more than 1800. Therefore, combining work stoppages with school closures is a very efficient strategy for protecting residents from airborne infectious disease. However, this is an ideal scenario.

Fig. 6 shows the effects of different personal decisions on infectious disease transmission. The green line shows the results of the hospital group, and the purple line shows the results when all of the infected people stay home. (We assumed that infected people make a random decision during the infectious period.) The number of infected people is much lower in the scenario where most of the infected people decide to go to hospital. In the case of all infected people staying home (purple line), the infection spreads very quickly because many people have already spread the disease before they decide to stay home. In other words, the efficiency of transmission prevention is low if infected patients stay home, and no other measures such as work stoppages and school closures are taken during the early stage of the outbreak. The red line (case 6) shows the results when 90% of the infected patients stay home and the other 10% take no measures. The percentage of infected people increases to 57% of the population after 115 days if there are no other controls. Comparing the black and purple lines, we can see that staying home is more helpful in controlling disease transmission than taking no measures. If all infected people go to hospital, the hospitals will run out of beds.

Fig. 7(a) and (b) show the infected population and cumulative infected population within 365 days. The red line is the baseline with the default settings (Vent = 1). Vent is the ventilation rate in each indoor environment compared with the default settings. When Vent = 2, the peak infectious population is delayed from day 130 to day 300, and the cumulative infected population after 1 year is three quarters of the cumulative infected population under Vent = 1 conditions. When Vent increases to 5, the smallpox will be generally controlled without any additional measures, and the cumulative infected population is less than 3000 after 1 year. However, a high ventilation rate signifies a serious waste of energy, especially in Hong Kong. Therefore, balancing ventilation and energy consumption is very important. In an airborne infectious disease outbreak, governments and residents should control the ventilation rates in public and private indoor environments and take other measures such as wearing masks, hand washing, and vaccination.",

More than one third of the population will become infected. We also found that the number of infected people increases slowly during the first several weeks and then sharply increases between days 60 and 150.

Our simulation also shows that at its peak, three out of every seven people would be infected. Focusing on the infection risks of different places, we determined that the number of people infected during their daily routines (at work or school) is twice the number of those infected at home [45] . This value is 1.4 because we assumed that people stay at home instead of going outside. Based on smallpox data collected in London from 1950 to 1965, the peak number of infected people occurs about 20-22 weeks after the beginning of an outbreak [46] . Due to the higher population density in Hong Kong, this peak will occur at about 19.75 weeks, which is when the most people will become infected by smallpox on 1 day. A smallpox outbreak will be naturally controlled after 150-200 days if no steps are taken to control it. If 50% of the population is vaccinated, the infection risk decreases to 29% [47] . We found that under a no-control scenario, a smallpox outbreak tends to stabilize after day 200. In the case of 50% vaccination, the infection risk becomes 27% if no other control measures are taken. Research has also indicated that the increasing trend agrees with Eq. (9) (R 0 is the basic reproduction number; T G is the generation time). Smallpox is less infectious (R 0 = 4-10) and has a much longer incubation period (T G \u2248 21) [48] .",
