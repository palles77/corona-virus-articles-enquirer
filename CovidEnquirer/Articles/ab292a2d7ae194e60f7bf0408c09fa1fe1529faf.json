Objectives: This paper describes a PCR-hybridization-immunoenzymatic assay (PCR Adenovirus consensus \u00ae ) used to detect Ad and identify Ad species in respiratory specimens. Results: On seven representative serotypes Ad 12, Ad 3, Ad 7, Ad 11, Ad 1, Ad 8, Ad 4, the mean genome equivalents per ml and the mean 50% infectious doses per ml were 10 6.3 and 10 4 , respectively. Using 362 nasal aspirates from children, Ad were detected by immunofluorescence (IF) and culture in 97 cases (27%), by the PCR-Ad hexon method in 107 cases (29.5%) and by the PCR Adenovirus Consensus \u00ae method in 113 cases (31.2%); 13 samples were found positive by both PCR and negative by the IF and culture methods; five samples were only positive according to the PCR Adenovirus Consensus \u00ae method. The sensitivity, specificity, predictive positive value and predictive negative value of the PCR Adenovirus Consensus \u00ae method were 97.9%, 93.2%, 84%, 99.1%, respectively. The method identified the species (sp) from 91 positive amplicons: 1 Ad sp A, 44 Ad sp B, 42 Ad sp C, 3 Ad sp E, and 1 Ad sp F; 85 isolates were identified by IF or the neutralisation in culture, and 86 by a PCR-RE digestion method. The PCR Adenovirus Consensus \u00ae detected six positive samples that were negative according to the IF and culture methods, and it identified the precise species of nine IF-positive and culture-negative nasal aspirates. Conclusion: The PCR Adenovirus Consensus \u00ae technique is more efficient than the classical IF or culture techniques for the detection of Ad in respiratory samples. An internal control is included to validate the screening results, and specific probes are used to identify the Ad species.",

            "text": "Ad isolates can be identified to the species level by the haemagglutination inhibition test and the neutralisation tests (Hierholzer, 1995) . The limitations of the neutralisation test are the need for the availability of type-specific antisera and the need to test multiple antisera against a single isolate. For that reason most laboratories choose to limit the test to the Ad that are most frequently isolated from patients with respiratory tract diseases: Ad serotypes 1, 2, 5, 6 from species C, Ad serotypes 3, 7 from species B1, and Ad serotype 4 from species E (Schmidtz et al., 1983) according to the recently amended classification system (Benk\u00f6 et al., 1999) (formerly subgenera). However, other Ad serotypes are oc-casionally detected in respiratory infections, especially in immunocompromised patients (Hierholzer, 1992) . The use of IFA and ELISA to detect antigens provides a rapid diagnosis, but requires significant levels of antigens for detection, and is generally less sensitive than the culture method. The value of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the diagnosis of Ad infections has recently been assessed. Most of the PCR assays used rely on the detection of sequences in the hexon gene region (Allard et al., 1990; Hierholzer et al., 1993; Morris et al., 1996; Raty et al., 1999) , whereas others use sequences in theVA RNA gene (Kidd et al., 1996) , the pIX gene (Akalu et al., 1998) or in the fiber gene (Xu et al., 2000) . Non-nested and nested PCRs have also been developed for the detection of the six species of Ad. These methods are based on the comparison of the migration of amplimers (Kidd et al., 1996) , the analysis of restriction enzyme profiles (Elnifro et al., 2000) and the use of multiplex PCR (Na et al., 2002; Pring-Akerblom et al., 1999; Xu et al., 2000) . Finally, a method based on a combination of PCR and restriction endonuclease digestion has been developed for the rapid identification of species and serotypes of Ad (Allard et al., 2001) .",

NCI-H292 and MRC5 cell cultures were used for the viral isolation technique. The immunofluorescence assay was systematically carried out in cultures exhibiting cytopathogenic effects and on NCI-H292 cells that had been incubated for 5 days. Ad serotypes were then identified using the classical neutralisation test in cell cultures and ATCC neutralising antibodies (Hierholzer, 1995 . One generic probe characterizing the Ad group and seven specific probes corresponding to Ad A, Ad B1, Ad B2, Ad C, Ad D, Ad E, Ad F are provided in the kit. However, an internal control, a composite plasmid containing sequences recognized by the primers flanking a plasmidic sequence, with thermodynamics similar to those of the viral sequence has been added to follow the inhibition of the amplification. This control is hybridized with a specific probe. A negative control of the amplification is performed for each experience with the premix amplication using sterile water. A negative detection control, human amplified product, is provided in order to determine the cut-off value. After detection of the positive samples with the generic probe, the species of the virus involved is determined using the specific probes on the same amplified product. (iii) PCR Ad hexon: We used the two hexon gene primers described by Hierholzer et al. (1993 Hierholzer et al. ( ) (positions 2728 Hierholzer et al. ( -2750 Hierholzer et al.

(iv) Serotyping: The results obtained with PCR Adenovirus Consensus \u00ae were compared with those obtained with the neutralisation test and the test described by Allard et al.

The technique described by Allard et al. (1990) amplifies a 308 bp fragment partially located in the P1 domain of the hexon gene. In comparison with the culture method, the sensitivity of the Allard method was 93% for species C (types 1, 2, 5, 6) and only 50% for Ad 3 and Ad 7 belonging to B1 species, which are particularly involved in the respiratory diseases (Morris et al., 1996) . Hierholzer et al. (1993) described a PCR method, which amplifies a 161 bp fragment located in the P2 region of the hexon gene associated with hybridisation to a fluorescent probe. In a study on 103 samples including 68 respiratory samples, the same number of positive samples were obtained with the culture method, the direct IF method and with the new PCR method. The PCR detection of Ad sequences may not reflect an active viral infection because some Ad (especially Ad 1, 2, 5, 6 from species C) can induce a latent infection. Some authors have suggested combining a PCR method with in situ hybridisation for positive samples (Matsuse et al., 1994) . Raty et al. (1999) compared techniques for the detection of Ad on 268 nasopharyngeal specimens obtained from soldiers affected by acute respiratory infections. According to the culture method, 59.1% of the samples were Ad positive compared to 31.9% for the antigen detection method and 62.9% for the PCR method using a crude isolate extracted by \"boiling.\" In this PCR method, the primers were located in the hexon gene (Allard et al., 1990) and an internal control was included for each sample, to avoid false negative results. Two samples (0.7%) were shown to contain inhibitors. Compared to the culture method, the sensitivity and specificity of the PCR method were 94% and 85%, respectively; 15 samples were positive according to the culture method and negative according to the PCR method. In our study on 362 nasal aspirates, the sensitivity and specificity of the PCR methods were higher: 97.9% and 93.2% respectively for the Adenovirus Consensus \u00ae PCR, and higher: 96.9% and 95% for the PCR hexon method. Eighteen samples were positive according to the Adenovirus Consensus \u00ae PCR and negative according to the IF and culture methods. These cannot be false positives due to contamination because: (i) 13 were confirmed as positive with a second PCR method and (ii) the five others were confirmed on a second extract. These samples probably contained a low viral yield, below the detection limits of the IF and culture methods. Alternatively, these Ad strains may have been uncultivable or virtually uncultivable (Hierholzer, 1992) . Finally, the Ad Consensus \u00ae PCR, method appeared to be more sensitive than the hexon PCR method with the screening probe, and was even more convenient following the introduction of an internal control for each sample, which reduced the number of false negative results by displaying inhibitors.",

These techniques are time-consuming and are not suitable for clinical diagnosis. Kidd et al. (1996) proposed a one-step PCR method able to screen and to identify Ad species associated with the study of the enzymatic restriction profile (Kidd et al., 1996) . The size of the amplified fragment varies in the different species and according to the number of copies of the VA RNA gene. Indeed, the A, B2 and F species, have one copy of the VA RNA gene, whereas the B1, C, D and E species have two copies, leading to 240-290 bp amplified fragments for the first group and 490-520 bp fragments for the second. To discriminate between members of each group (A, B2, F and B1, C, D, E) they analysed the enzymatic restriction profiles of the amplified products. On 200 Ad culture isolates, only 3% of the results were discordant with the seroneutralisation results. Our PCR, AdV Consensus \u00ae method, uses different primers to Kidd et al. (1996) , located in the same VA RNA region, and specific probes to identify each Ad species. Seventy-six of the species identified by culture seroneutralisation were confirmed by the AdV Consensus \u00ae method. In addition, six Ad detected by direct IF and not isolated by culture were identified as being B1 and C species, and six others, negative according to IF and culture, were detected and identified as being B1, C, and F species.",

The technique described by Allard et al.

This method gave good results on 51 Ad prototype strains and 44 variant strains. Thirty-four of the 40 clinical samples (including eight respiratory samples) were positive according to both the PCR and the culture methods. Six were not amplified and had to be further tested by nested PCR, but the amplimer was too short to be analysed by restriction endonucleases. We compared this identification technique with the conventional seroneutralisation technique and the AdV Consensus \u00ae technique on the 160 nasal aspirates of our study. Five of the 91 Ad strains, amplified and identified by the AdV Consensus \u00ae technique, were not detected by the Allard method: one Ad 3 and two Ad sp B1 (not detected by culture), one Ad sp C and one Ad sp F (not detected by culture).",
