The fusion proteins contained an N-terminal, Ulp1-cleavable 6xHis-Sumo tag. All proteins were expressed in BL21 (DE3) cells using standard protocols, and purified with a two-step Ni-affinity chromatography followed by cleavage of the tag. RNA contaminated samples of IFIT1 and IFIT5 were passed over a Mono Q 4.6/100 PE (GE Healthcare) or HiTrap Q HP 5ml (GE Healthcare) in 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and eluted over a shallow salt gradient. To recover IFIT5 that co-purified with RNA from E. coli, the contaminated fractions were incubated in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 with 5 M NaCl, and buffer exchanged in an Amicon Ultracel (30kDa cutoff) concentrator several times until the bound RNA flowed through (purity was determined by A 260 :A 280 ratios). A final gel filtration step using Superdex75 or Superdex200 (GE Healthcare) columns was carried out in 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol and 3 mM DTT (IFITs 1, 3 and 5) or 20 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 150 mM NaCl and 3 mM DTT (nIFIT1).",

To generate the various PPP-RNAs for crystallization, we used several dsOligo templates (oligoCT 7 , oligoUT 7 , oligoAT 7, BioCorp DNA, Supplementary Table 4), which encoded 3 templated positions of C, U or A. By ensuring that each reaction contained only CTP, UTP or ATP, the final product was guaranteed to have sequence homogeneity. The typical non-templated n + 1, n + 2 products of T 7 transcription were observed (see crystallization section). The reactions were cleaned up by phenol/chloroform extraction, and precipitated with ethanol. For gel-shift assays, a 44nt PPP-ssRNA (Supplementary Table 5 RNA was purified from the in vitro transcription reaction using RNeasy kit (Qiagen). 7SK-as RNA for gel shifts was prepared using the SP6 MEGAscript kit (Invitrogen). 5'monophosphorylated RNA was obtained by adding guanosine 5'-monophosphate (Sigma-Aldrich) at a 5:1 ratio to GTP in the in vitro transcription reaction, and capped RNA by adding cap analog (m7G(5')ppp(5')G, Epicentre) at a 4:1 ratio. 5'-OH RNA was prepared by CIP (New England Biolabs) treatment of ppp-RNA.

In contrast, the sugar pucker of N2 is the typical C3\u2032-endo. In c, the 5\u2032-phopshate of N3 is not shown for clarity. residues, and Van der Waal contact residues are circled with green lines. Residues are coloured by the subdomain from which they originate. Only residues within a 4 \u00c5 sphere were considered as Van der Waal contacts, and polar contacts were cut-off at 3.2 \u00c5. *The Van der Waal contact between Phe339 and the second cytosine base occurs only when the base adopts a syn conformation (see Supplementary Fig. 10) . In Fig. 5c , the only IFIT5 residue that interacted with the 5\u2032-triphosphate and was not critical for binding was the metal coordinating residue Glu33, which only led to partial loss of binding when mutated to alanine. One explanation for this is that the loss of the negative charge from Glu33 is partially alleviated by the immediately adjacent Asp334 (Supplementary Fig. 8 ). Y156F in IFIT5 had little impact on binding, presumably because the interaction also involves significant Van der Waals contact between Y156 and the base (N1). H287A, which hydrogen bonds to the second ribose sugar also led to only a partial loss in binding, presumably because the next residue, Gln288, provides a redundant interaction in this region. Interestingly, IFIT1 Q42E, which would interact with the \u03b2-and \u03b3-phosphates (based on IFIT5), did not lead to loss of binding in IFIT1. This may be related to the natural substitution of nearby Thr37 in IFIT5 for arginine (R38) in IFIT1, which possibly replaces the Gln41 interaction with the 5\u2032-triphosphate group. ",

Predicted cut sites that lie within helices or are important for folding are most likely protected from the proteases. The most probable cut sites (scissor-like schema) indicate that trypsin has many potential cut sites within loops resulting in complete degradation of the protein. Chymotrypsin has fewer potential cut sites, which can result in the stable fragments observed in c. Elastase most likely cleaves only at Ala432 resulting in an ~47 kDa fragment. Addition of RNA results in a dramatic protection against trypsin and chymotrypsin cleavage, since most of their probable cut sites are N-terminal and are likely to be stabilized in the compact form of IFIT5 with RNA. Moreover, many of the Nterminal loops are in close proximity to the RNA binding pocket in the bound form. On the other hand, Ala432 is further away from the RNA in the bound form (b), and is likely to be exposed and still accessible to elastase, explaining why the ~47 kDa fragment arises even after adding the RNA. c, SDS-PAGE gels used to construct the composite gel in theFigure 4of the main text.",
