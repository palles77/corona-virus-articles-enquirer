The superior diagnostic yield of multiplex PCR means that a pathogen is detected rapidly in a much greater proportion of patients, so therapy can be quickly tailored to the responsible organism. In some situations, this will allow narrowing of antimicrobial therapy: for example, identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae facilitating a change of antibiotics to penicillin, in geographical areas with a low prevalence of penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae . In other cases, it may facilitate a change or escalation of antimicrobial therapy: for example, the identification of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) which would not be covered by empirical regimens in many areas. The absence of detection is also helpful: the sensitivity when compared to culture of molecular assays is very high so can reassure clinicians that organisms are not present and so support decisions to stop unnecessary antibiotics or to deescalate antibiotics that were used empirically to cover organisms subsequently not detected.",

Many of these organisms have predictable resistance patterns when interpreted with local epidemiological data. Gadsby et al. developed and internally validated their own syndromic molecular assay for pneumonia. They used this to test sputum samples of 323 adults admitted to hospital with CAP 16 . Their assay detected a pathogen in 87% of patients (as opposed to 39% of patients using only routine culture). As a result, they proposed that 77% of antibiotic prescriptions in CAP could have been deescalated based on results from multiplex PCR testing. The majority of these potential interventions involved stopping clarithromycin when atypical organisms were not detected or 'narrowing' antibiotics when a likely sensitive pathogen had been detected.",

The ResPOC trial was a pragmatic randomised controlled trial that tested patients with community acquired acute respiratory illness using the BioFire Respiratory Panel (which tests comprehensively for respiratory viruses and atypical bacteria) at the point-of-care. It found that patients who were tested with the FilmArray were significantly more likely to receive a single dose or shorter course of antibiotics 24 than those who were not.

The qualitative bacterial targets are Chlamydia pneumoniae, L. pneumophilia and M. pneumoniae . Resistance gene targets are 5 carbapenemases ( bla KPC , bla NDM , bla OXA-48 , bla VIM , bla IMP ) , one ESBL ( bla CTX \u2212M ) and two MRSA genes ( mecA/C and MREJ) . The viral targets are Influenza A, Influenza B, Rhinovirus/Enterovirus, Adenovirus, RSV, Coronavirus , human Metapneumovirus , and Parainfluenza viruses (types1, 2, 3 and 4). The assay is validated on several sample types; sputum (including expressed sputum), bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and endotracheal aspirates. Sample preparation takes 5 min and the test has a run time of around an hour and 15 min. A Pneumonia plus panel is also available which has an additional Middle-Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS CoV) target.The negative percent agreement (NPA) is the specificity of a test when compared to a non-reference standard. Some authors use this when reporting results in lieu of specificity as a result of the imperfect nature of current diagnostics. The NPA of bacterial detection between culture-based methods and the FA pneumonia panel varies between different or ganisms but is consistently very high. In the manufacturers dataset only two organisms on the panel have an NPAbelow 95%: H. influenzae (91.4% [95% CI 89.3-93.1%]) and S. aureus (91.2% [95% CI 89.1-93.0%])",
