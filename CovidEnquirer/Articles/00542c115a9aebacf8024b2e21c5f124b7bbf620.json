The specimens were stored at \u221270 \u2022 C until further tested. Informed consent was obtained at admission from parents. The possibility of hMPV infection was excluded by nested RT-PCR using specific primers to amplify a part of the F-gene as previously described (van den Hoogen et al., 2004) . Clinical definitions were: croup was hoarseness of voice, barking cough, and inspiratory stridor due to laryngeal obstruction; tracheobronchitis was cough and rhonchi and no laryngeal obstruction or wheezing; bronchiolitis was expiratory wheezing with or without tachypnea, air trapping, and substernal retractions; pneumonia was rales or evidence of pulmonary consolidation on physical examination or radiograph; bronchial asthma was acute wheezing occurring three or more times in children of any age or occurring one or more times in children aged >3 years. The diagnoses of the patients were croup in 29, pneumonia in 290, bronchiolitis in 257, acute bronchitis in 40, upper respiratory tract infection in 21, and bronchial asthma in 190. The median age was 15 months (range = patients ranged from 1 to 192 months in age): children 5 years of age or younger constituted 92.7% (759/827) of the study population.

            "text": "This is the first report of HCoV-NL63 infections in Korean children hospitalized with acute respiratory disease. HCoV-NL63 circulated in Korean children during 2004-2006. Coronaviruses are divided into three different groups: group 1 (HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63); group 2a (HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1); group 2b (SARS-CoV); group 3, but human pathogens are only found in groups 1 and 2. Coronavirus HCoV-NL63 infections have been reported in the Netherlands, Australia, Japan, Canada, USA, France, and Hong Kong (Arden et al., 2005; Bastien et al., 2005; Chiu et al., 2005; Ebihara et al., 2005; Esper et al., 2005; Vabret et al., 2005; van den Hoogen et al., 2004) , which suggest that this newly discovered human coronavirus has a worldwide distribution. Although, we did not include a healthy control group, HCoV-NL63 presence in the nasal aspirates of children with acute respiratory disease, in the absence of an alternate etiology, suggests that it may have a role in the illness. However, the causal association HCoV-NL63 cannot be established without including a healthy control group. The incidence of HCoV-NL63 in patients with respiratory disease of unknown etiology is reported to be 1.2-9.3% (Esper et al., 2005; Moes et al., 2005; Suzuki et al., 2005; Vabret et al., 2005) . In this study, the positive rate of HCoV-NL63 (1.7%) was comparable to that of Australia and Japan (Arden et al., 2005; Suzuki et al., 2005) . The differences in HCoV-NL63 positivity rates among several studies may be due to the characteristics of the study populations and the collection time of respiratory specimens. In a Japanese study, HCoV-NL63 was detected in 2.5% of hospitalized children with acute bronchiolitis suggesting that it plays an etiological role in bronchiolitis (Ebihara et al., 2005) . In this study, HCoV-NL63 was associated with croup in most of the positive children (9/14, 64.1%), which is consistent with a recent report showing strong association between HCoV-NL63 infection and croup (Moes et al., 2005) . However, others have reported that mild and nonspecific symptoms are frequent in HCoV-NL63 positive patients and that detection occurred occasionally in healthy children (Boivin et al., 2005; Moes et al., 2005; Suzuki et al., 2005) . In this study, HCoV-NL63 infections occurred in previously well patients which is consistent with what was found in previous studies (Arden et al., 2005; Chiu et al., 2005; Ebihara et al., 2005) , although others have reported that many children with HCoV-NL63 infection had an underlying disease such as prematurity or cardiac disease (Esper et al., 2005; Moes et al., 2005) .",

These results indicate that the 1a gene of HCoV-NL63 is a highly conserved region which aids in its detection by RT-PCR. We do not think that our results are false positives because cross contamination controls were negative and all positive RT-PCR results were confirmed by a second run. Although some reported high frequency (75%, 9/12) of mixed infection (Boivin et al., 2005) , we detected co-infections with HCoV-NL63 and another respiratory virus in only two cases.",

In this study HCoV-NL63 was detected in spring and winter of 2004, and spring of 2006. Although a comparable number of specimens were included, we could not detect HCoV-NL63 in the respiratory specimens during winter [2005] [2006] . It is known that outbreaks of other coronaviruses including HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 occur every second year (Monto and Lim, 1974) . Our results show that outbreaks of HCoV-NL63 infections do not occur every year: further studies are needed to confirm the pattern of periodicity of outbreaks in Korea. Phylogenetic analysis showed that different strains are cocirculating in Korea, which is similar to findings in other countries (Arden et al., 2005; Bastien et al., 2005; Moes et al., 2005; Vabret et al., 2005) .",
