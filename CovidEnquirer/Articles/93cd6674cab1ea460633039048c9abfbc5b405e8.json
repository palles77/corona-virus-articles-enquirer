(L. chinensis) extracts against the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). Methods: The anti-M. tuberculosis activity of M. azedarach and L. chinensis extracts were evaluated using different indicator methods such as resazurin microtiter assay (REMA) and mycobacteria growth indicator tube (MGIT) 960 system assay. The M. tuberculosis was incubated with various concentrations (50-800 mg/mL) of the extracts for 5 days in the REMA, and for 4 weeks in MGIT 960 system assay. Results: M. azedarach and L. chinensis extracts showed their anti-M. tuberculosis activity by strongly inhibiting the growth of M. tuberculosis in a concentration-dependent manner in the REMA and the MGIT 960 system assay. Particularly, the methanol extract of M. azedarach and n-hexane extract of L. chinensis consistently exhibited their effects by effectively inhibiting the growth of M. tuberculosis in MGIT 960 system for 4 weeks with a single-treatment, indicating higher anti-M. tuberculosis activity than other extracts,",

Conclusions: These results demonstrate that M. azedarach and L. chinensis extracts not only have unique anti-M. tuberculosis activity, but also induce the selective anti-M. tuberculosis effects by consistently inhibiting or blocking the growth of M. tuberculosis through a new pharmacological action. Therefore, this study suggests the potential of them as effective candidate agents of next-generation for developing a new anti-tuberculosis drug, as well as the advantage for utilizing traditional medicinal plants as one of effective strategies against tuberculosis.",

            "text": "Recently chronic infectious diseases including tuberculosis, hepatitis, filariasis, leishmaniasis, amoebiasis caused by Entamoeba histolytica, as well as acute infectious zoonosis such as malaria, Middle East respiratory syndrome, influenza and Ebola, have been occurred or persisted in various countries, particularly, in less-developed countries globally. Furthermore, the prevalence of tuberculosis has still been causing a serious global challenge of drug-resistant tuberculosis such as extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) despite various efforts and studies worldwide. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) is one of the major infectious factors causing the highest mortality through the co-infection with HIV/AIDS as well as the most dangerous infectious bacteria causing resistant strain through fast infectivity and the adaptability against environmental variation. Recently, it was estimated that 9.0 million people in the world were confirmed as new tuberculosis cases in 2013, and 1.1 million of them had HIV-positive response. Particularly, tuberculosis cases co-infected with HIV/AIDS showed high-infection rates in the African region compared with other countries, and most of tuberculosis cases in 2013 and 2014 occurred in Asia (56%) and the African region (29%) [1, 2] . In these aspects, various studies for the inhibition and/or the treatment of tuberculosis have been carried out in anti-tuberculosis drug discovery/development field. However, the current anti-tuberculosis drugs not only showed the limit that can't inhibit the increase of the tuberculosis patients, but also caused various side effects. Recently, the global pharmaceutical companies for the development of novel/effective anti-tuberculosis drugs are testing the repurposed compounds such as PA-824, SQ109 and linezolid through chemical remodeling of the existing drugs, as well as newly developed compounds such as Q203, TMC207, pyridomycin, and thiophenes in clinical trials [1, [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Nevertheless, the rapid emergence of tuberculosis including MDR-TB and XDR-TB is still inducing serious concerns and problems in the public health field worldwide. Recently, various extracts and/or natural products derived from medicinal plants or traditional oriental medicine were studied or reported for discovering novel anti-M. tuberculosis candidate drugs, which are being progressed for developing antituberculosis drugs of more effective/safe next-generation [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Furthermore, various medicinal plants of oriental medicine have been utilized as traditional resources for treating diseases and/or symptoms such as diabetes, arteriosclerosis, hepatitis, parasite, cancer both \"in vivo\" and \"in vitro\" [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .",

            "text": "The recent zoonotic diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome, avian influenza and Ebola have been occurred in various countries worldwide through diverse infectious pathways, particularly, in Asia, Middle East and Africa. Furthermore, the serious infectious pathogens such as influenza, M. tuberculosis, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus have strongly enhanced their infectivity and viability through resistance or adaptability to drugs as well as environmental variation for the past decades, which induces serious difficulty to treatment and prevention of the disease as well as the development of the effective drug. In particular, these diseases have caused high risk symptoms to young children whose immune function is low and the elderly who have other underlying diseases or complications compared with normal adults. In this aspect, tuberculosis is a disease to cause infection through droplets, which has been causing high mortality and prevalence rate compared with other contagious diseases worldwide. Tuberculosis was one of the leading causes of death among various infectious diseases in 2013 and 2014 globally, particularly, in Africa [1, 2] . It is the most dangerous infectious disease causing complications such as bronchiectasis, emphysema, and pneumothorax through chronic symptom. In addition, the rapid increase and appearance of XDR-TB/MDR-TB imply an urgent need to develop anti-tuberculosis drugs of effective/safe next-generation for treating tuberculosis. Until recently, despite various efforts to discover and to develop new anti-tuberculosis drugs, the development of effective/safe anti-tuberculosis drugs is still facing with direct or indirect-difficulty including the cost or time as well as the economic aspect and the profitability of pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, the overuse of antibiotics and antibacterial drugs has rapidly increased the prevalence and incidence rate of resistant-tuberculosis such as XDR-TB and MDR-TB, which has caused more difficulty to treat tuberculosis-patients compared with the past. In addition, the current anti-tuberculosis drugs induce various/serious side effects including hepatotoxicity, ototoxicity, and nephrotoxicity. In this aspect, as one of feasible alternatives for overcoming limitations of the drug's side effects, particularly, including rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol and moxifloxacin, various studies for developing anti-tuberculosis drugs were reported from active substances derived from traditional diverse medicinal plants and biological resources [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . However, antituberculosis agents of effective/safe next-generation that can be utilized or used as potential/novel first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs, particularly, the extracts, natural products, and/or semi-synthetic compounds, have not yet been reported in the global pharmaceutical market. In this perspective, the new pharmacological activity of medicinal plants used in oriental medicine or traditional medicine can provide the advantages of both the safety and efficacy compared with newly developed drugs such as semi-synthetic compounds or biomedicine, which may be used or utilized as one of effective/feasible strategies for developing antituberculosis drugs of effective/safe next-generation. Moreover, the plants selected from the existing medicinal plants through new pharmacological action may increase the potential which can be utilized as a useful/feasible resource for developing new substances in a medical field. For these reasons, this study has been focused on major key points for the discovery of new candidate substances as one of different strategies for developing anti-tuberculosis drugs, which has included crucial factors such as the minimization of side effects and the safety of drugs, as well as the finding of novel pharmacological activity and function of the medicinal plants used in Korean traditional medicine. In these aspects, M. azedarach and L. chinensis are medicinal plants that are used as biological resources of traditional oriental medicine in Korea, Japan and China as well as various countries and regions globally, which include various bioactive substances. Until recently, pharmacological activity and function of them have been variously reported as follows: (1) the aqueous extracts from M. azedarach induce the effect of wound healing by activating the growth of keratinocyte [24] ; (2) the pediculicidal activity of ethanol extracts of M. azedarach [25] ;",

However, despite the pharmacological activity or actions of them identified through these studies, their anti-tubercular activity have not yet been reported in both \"in vitro\" and \"in vivo\". For this reason, this study has been begun from hypothesis that M. azedarach and L. chinensis may strongly inhibit or block and effectively modulate the growth of M. tuberculosis. As mentioned above, the results of this study showed novel anti-tubercular activity of M. azedarach and L. chinensis extracts by effectively inhibiting the growth of M. tuberculosis through their novel pharmacological activity and properties. Particularly, anti-M. tuberculosis activity and the ability of M. azedarach and L. chinensis extracts were obviously demonstrated through different M. tuberculosis susceptibility-indicator assays such as the REMA and MGIT 960 system assay, and they consistently showed their anti-M. tuberculosis activity by strongly inhibiting the growth of M. tuberculosis for 4 weeks with a single treatment (400 mg/mL and 800 mg/mL) in MGIT 960 system assay, respectively. In addition, the specificity and differences in anti-M. tuberculosis activity of them were obviously confirmed in the MGIT 960 system assay compared with the REMA assay, and the methanol extract of M. azedarach more effectively inhibited the growth of M. tuberculosis compared with those of L. chinensis extracts. These results imply that the intracellular signaling-pathways for replication as well as key-proteins for regulating cell cycle in cytoplasm that accelerate the growth of M. tuberculosis and/or functions of the cell wall of M. tuberculosis are strongly inhibited or deactivated by the binding of the extracts. Furthermore, the extracts showed higher anti-M. tuberculosis activity in M. tuberculosis H37Ra than M. tuberculosis H37Rv in the MGIT 960 system assay, and it suggests that these results can be associated with differences in pathogenesis and virulence of the two strains or different pathogenic phenotypes between H37Rv and H37Ra.",

The bacteria were adjusted to a density of 2 \u00d7 10 6 CFU/mL in fresh culture broth.Finally, the bacterial suspensions were inoculated into all wells of a 96-well microtiter plate containing final concentrations (50-200 mg/mL) of M. azedarach and L. chinensis extracts and anti-tuberculosis first-line drugs (1.25-5.00 mg/mL). M. tuberculosis growth controls containing no anti-M. tuberculosis first-line drugs and blank controls without inoculation were also included. The 96well plates, covered with lids, placed in a plastic bag, were incubated at 37 C for 5 days. After incubation, 20 mL of freshly prepared 0.05% (w/v) resazurin solution was added to all wells, and the plates were re-incubated at 37 C for 36 h. A change in color from blue to pink indicating bacterial growth was observed after 36 h of incubation. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was expressed as the lowest concentration of the drug that inhibited M. tuberculosis growth or prevented change in color of the resazurin solution from blue to pink based on a REMA. anti-M. tuberculosis effects of M. azedarach and L. chinensis extracts against the growth of M. tuberculosis, the drug susceptibility testing of the strain was further performed using the BACTEC\u2122 MGIT 960 system (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Sparks, MD, USA). In brief, 100 mL of a suspension of M. tuberculosis culture, adjusted to 9.6 \u00d7 10 6 CFU/ mL, was inoculated in an MGIT growth media tube with BACTEC\u2122 MGIT 960 growth supplement (Becton, Dickinson and Company), which were incubated with different concentrations (25-800 mg/mL) of the extracts and anti-M. tuberculosis first-line drugs (10 mg/mL), and M. tuberculosis growth controls containing no anti-M. tuberculosis first-line drugs were also included.
