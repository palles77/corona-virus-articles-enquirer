Profound respiratory fatigue and exhaustion from increased work of breathing for days before admission contribute to the acute danger of an exacerbation. In asthma and COPD, the immediate goal is to guard against hypoxia with supplemental oxygen and to relieve dyspnea with short-acting beta-agonist bronchodilators with or without ipratropium bromide. The main goal is to avoid further respiratory compromise and failure. The 30-day mortality from acute COPD exacerbation is between 11% and 26% (more fatal than acute myocardial infarction), and approximately 340 patients with COPD and 10 asthmatics die each day in the United States. [2] [3] [4] The management of both diseases is similar. The fundamental difference from the home setting is close respiratory monitoring by registered nurses and respiratory therapists. In addition, noninvasive ventilation (NIV), particularly for patients with COPD, is available, and prevents the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, and associated risk of pneumonia. In severe stage 4 COPD, direct admission for hospice can be considered. Patients with asthma and COPD are hospitalized when they cannot manage at home, often indicated by the failure to improve with frequent albuterol use over a 2-or 3-day period. In both diseases, antibiotics and intravenous corticosteroids may shorten duration of symptoms and length of hospital stay, and prevent respiratory failure. On hospital discharge, patient with asthma or COPD benefit from outpatient transitional care services and instructions for follow-up care to ensure patient safety and prevent hospital readmission.",

Some asthmatics do not show responsiveness until they have had 2 to 3 weeks of corticosteroid treatment. 4 Although smoking is a risk factor for emphysema and COPD, only 20% of chronic smokers develop COPD. 6 The following questions can help differentiate between asthma and COPD, but this needs to be put into the context of the clinician's suspicion, experience, and patient response to treatments. 4, 7 Of note, patients with ACOS may have all the symptoms mentioned here; therefore, consider consulting a pulmonologist. In summary, both patients with asthma and those with COPD respond very well to bronchodilators.

Well-controlled asthma (per the Asthma Control Test [ACT] is a score of 20 or more) is obviously preferable to very poorly controlled asthma (ACT score 15). Asthmatics are at risk for several complications during and after surgery, including impaired cough, atelectasis, acute bronchoconstriction, mucous plugging, hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and respiratory infection. The likelihood of complications is related to the severity of the patient's asthma and degree of symptom control before, during, and immediately after surgery. 4 The following are recommendations to help reduce the risk of complications during preoperative and postoperative elective nonemergent surgery.",

For select patients with history of high-dose ICS therapy (high-dose ICS is 500-2000 mg/d), stress doses of corticosteroids may also be indicated; clinically relevant adrenal suppression has been reported. 4, [37] [38] [39] If possible, an attempt to improve lung function preoperatively (FEV 1 or peak expiratory flow rate) to the patient's personal best or predicted values is recommended. A short course of oral corticosteroids can be considered in addition to daily controller drug therapy. Consider allergy or pulmonary consultation preoperatively if questions remain or the risk of pulmonary complications is considered very high.",
