However, as with gene therapy, a major barrier to progress is the lack of methods to achieve and measure efficient delivery for systemic administration. We have developed a positive-readout pharmacodynamic transgenic reporter mouse model allowing noninvasive real-time assessment of siRNA activity. The model combines a luciferase reporter gene under the control of regulatory elements from the lac operon of Escherichia coli. Introduction of siRNA targeting lac repressor results in increased luciferase expression in cells where siRNA is biologically active. Five founder luciferase-expressing and three founder Lacexpressing lines were generated and characterized. Mating of ubiquitously expressing luciferase and lac lines generated progeny in which luciferase expression was significantly reduced compared with the parental line. Administration of isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside either in drinking water or given intraperitoneally increased luciferase expression in eight of the mice examined, which fell rapidly when withdrawn. Intraperitoneal administration of siRNA targeting lac in combination with Lipofectamine 2000 resulted in increased luciferase expression in the liver while control nontargeting siRNA had no effect. We believe a sensitive positive readout pharmacodynamics reporter model will be of use to the research community in RNAi-based vector development.",

            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful approach for suppressing expression of specific genes in mammalian cells, either as a basic research tool to elucidate gene function, or in a clinical setting for therapeutic application. 1-3 Therapeutic strategies eliciting RNAi involve targeting exogenous genes from pathogens or endogenous genes playing a role in the disease process. Since the landmark discovery of RNAi in 1998, the number of in vivo studies involving siRNA has greatly increased with thousands of studies now reported and >30 clinical trials involving siRNA-or shRNA-based drugs having been opened. 4, 5 Although local delivery of siRNA may be very effective in some settings [6] [7] [8] [9] , for many diseases, delivery to disseminated or body-wide targets is required. There have been several steps towards enabling systemic delivery of siRNA, including both improved chemistry to increase serum stability and reduced immunostimulation, 4,10 coupled with delivery strategies such as hydrodynamic injection, 11, 12 liposomes and lipid-based nanoparticles, [13] [14] [15] polyplexes, 16, 17 ligand-siRNA conjugates, [18] [19] [20] and inorganic particles. 21, 22 However, there remain major challenges in studying the performance of siRNA given intravenously. Biodistribution has been studied by fluorescence, 23, 24 radioactivity, 25, 26 or complexation with magnetic nanoparticles, 27 although tracing techniques may intrinsically alter pharmacokinetics of the labeled molecules and the time window of usefulness for such studies is limited by siRNA catabolism.",

Techniques to assess siRNA activity (or \"pharmacodynamics\") are dependent on the nature of the molecular target, for example, where siRNA targets mRNA encoding specific enzymes, pharmacodynamics can be assessed by measuring inhibition of enzyme activity. Unfortunately, such assays are highly invasive, preventing timeresolved assessment in the same animals, and it can be very easy for researchers to miss spatially off-target effects. In principle, every target-expressing cell type in the body must be evaluated to assess whether siRNA activity is truly restricted to the intended target. One way to address this limitation on study of pharmacodynamics involves the use of transgenic reporter mice or disease models that ubiquitously or selectively express reporter genes such as GFP or luciferase, to test the ability of siRNA to silence expression at the target site. 28, 29 However, such systems are not ideal since models generating selective expression of the target reporter gene mRNA in a specific organ will skew the data to give a desired outcome; while ubiquitously expressing \"negativereadout\" models suffer from high levels of background from nontarget tissues, giving an intrinsic poor signal-to-noise ratio.",

We have previously developed an inducible in vitro system using the lac repressor in which siRNA activity results in a positive readout of luciferase expression. 30 Based on the well-characterized E. colilac operon, 31 in the absence of lactose the lac repressor (lacI) binds as a homotetramer to the lac operators (lacO) located within the promoter region, blocking transcription of the downstream gene (Figure 1a) . Lactose (or its synthetic analogue isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)) causes a conformational change in the repressor causing it to vacate the operators allowing RNA polymerases to gain access to the promoter and initiate transcription. When the repressor is removed from the operator, transcription from the lac operon resumes. Introduction of siRNA targeting the lac repressor mRNA will reduce levels of repressor protein allowing expression of a reporter gene, in our case luciferase, downstream of a lacO-containing promoter, thus giving a positive readout of RNAi activity. Scrable et al. independently developed a system in which the bacterial lac expression system was \"mammalianized\" via appropriate codon usage, to generate a working transgenic mouse model in which luciferase expression was regulated by the lac repressor but could be induced by IPTG administration in the drinking water. [32] [33] [34] Using the Scrable constructs, we have recreated the mouse model here, and in doing so, we have created and tested the first transgenic mouse model in which every cell of the animal can potentially reveal every site of siRNA biological activity. The advantage of this system is it provides noninvasive readouts that allow time-based measurement of body-wide effects of siRNA and therefore provides a platform for comparing and developing siRNA vector systems.",

Cells that received non-Lac targeting siRNA (including siRNA targeting the bacterial version of the repressor) showed no reduction in lac expression. Importantly, siLac#3 had no effect on the level of luciferase expression when codelivered with pHDLacOLuc (Figure 5b) , confirming this sequence has no off-target effect on luciferase mRNA. Having identified a potent sequence, a second siRNA containing serum stabilizing modifications (siSTABLE-siLac#3) was synthesized in preparation for in vivo delivery applications. Cotransfection of siSTABLE-siLac#3 with pLacIR reduced repressor expression to levels comparable with the unmodified siLac sequence (Figure 5c ); a control siSTABLE sequence having little effect. siLac#3 and siSTABLE-Lac#3 were then assessed for their ability to restore luciferase expression using a transient cotransfection assay involving delivery of up to four components, including the reporter (HDLacOLuc) and repressor (LacIR) plasmids.

As expected, the lac repressor-mediated fall in luciferase expression was fully restored on induction with 5 mmol/l IPTG. Importantly, the codelivery of siRNA targeting the repressor (siLac#3 or siSTABLE-Lac#3) also fully restored luciferase expression, while control siRNAs (siHBsAg and siSTABLE-Cont.) had no effect. These results confirm that siLac#3 and siSTABLE-Lac#3 are capable of downregulating lac repressor in cells bearing the dual expression system mediating a rise in reporter gene expression.

            "text": "Scrable et al. previously developed the luciferase-expressing lac repressor model in order to visualize the dynamics of gene expression in real-time in the living mouse. [32] [33] [34] We have recapitulated the model here to provide a positive readout of siRNA activity. Originally, Scrable et al. reported that upon IPTG induction body-wide luciferase expression fell back to 34% of the induced levels after 48 hours and returned to initial background levels after 7 days. The mice generated in this study appeared to have more rapid kinetics since luciferase expression returned to background within 24-48 hours of IPTG removal. As a result, they appear to be more responsive than the animals from the first study possibly as a result of greater repressor protein expression. Luciferase expression was variable among the single transgenic offspring of the HDLacOLuc-424 founder mouse. However, significant repression of luciferase expression was observed in the double transgenic progeny mice resulting from a cross with the LacIR-866 line in which lac repressor expression was robust and ubiquitous. Luciferase expression levels within the individual double transgenic mice were stable for over 12 months in some cases, with changes (increased signal) only observed due to hair loss in more elderly mice. Despite the significant degree of luciferase repression in the HDLacOLuc x LacIR mice, only 2 of the 28 individuals examined (1005 and 255) showed levels of luciferase expression that were as low as wild-type or LacIR mice. Consequently, in our hands from these particular matings, the system appeared to be slightly leaky and complete repression was rarely obtained. There is also a high degree of animal-to-animal variability in the luciferase expression in the double transgenics that needs to be addressed before widespread practical application as a test model. Further inbreeding may help to reduce the variability between individuals. We believe the situation of incomplete repression could be improved through the use of additional regulatory factors such as the genetic switch proposed by Deans et al. 36 These authors have developed a cassette comprising a short hairpin RNA construct that targets the reporter gene but whose expression is under the control of another repressor (Tet) which in turn is regulated by lac operator sites located within its promoter. Consequently, in the off state, the lac repressor prevents expression of the reporter gene and represses the expression of the Tet repressor. At the same time, expression of the hairpin RNA can occur that further reduces any residual reporter gene expression. Induction can be achieved with IPTG allowing reporter gene expression through the combined release of lac from the operator sites located within the reporter gene promoter and also the promoter of the TetR resulting in TetR expression and repression of the short hairpin RNA expression. With reference to our system, one would envisage that siRNA targeting the LacR would function in the same manner as IPTG (thus giving rise to luciferase expression) but in a system less prone to leakiness.",

            "text": "Application of uncomplexed naked siSTABLE-Lac#3 into thigh muscle failed to induce a luciferase signal presumably since the siRNA does not enter cells effectively in the absence of an entry mechanism such as electroporation. In contrast, Lipofectamine 2000 complexation of serum stabilized siRNA at a dose of 1 mg/kg administered by the i.p. route resulted in a threefold increase in luciferase expression (compared with negative control siRNA) in peritoneal organs confirming the potential of the model to identify siRNA activity. No expression was observed when the dose was reduced to 0.3 mg/kg (data not shown). As Lipofectamine 2000 is not a particularly sophisticated in vivo delivery vector, it is likely that more effective vehicles will yield greater responses. Furthermore, the limit of detection may be reduced when induction is obtained in organs at greater depth from the skin. One application of the model would be to compare the commercially available delivery systems to determine those that are optimal for each researcher's particular requirement. Shen and colleagues at Abbott laboratories have developed a positive-readout cellular model based on the Tet repressor system in which Tet repressor protein binds to Tet operator sites located within the luciferase promoter. 37 Use of specific siRNAs to target the tet repressor results in an increase in luciferase expression and thus a positive readout of siRNA activity. By encoding this system in cancer cell lines, they were able to implant tumor xenografts into nude mice and rats and compare a range of delivery vectors for tumor targeting. They concluded that 2.5 mg siRNA/kg formulated in DODAP-based liposomes (Avanti Polar Lipids) or SNALP-based liposomes 26 were the only systems capable of delivery to liver tumors following intravenous injection. While this is a very valuable assay system it cannot provide information regarding activity of the siRNA in the rodent cells (i.e., off target in terms of cellular targeting). This can only be achieved through use of transgenic models in which every cell expresses the reporter system such as the one described here. While our mice would be refractory to developing human tumor xenografts, it would be possible to encode the repressor system into a mouse tumor line that could then provide a model of tumor targeting. Alternatively, we envisage that orthotopic tumor models could be developed where targeting to specific organs or metastases might provide a more realistic model.

The authors demonstrated that inhibition of blinding choroidal neovascularization from a model of age-related macular degeneration in mice was as effective using control nonspecific siRNA as by administration of siRNA targeting VEGFa or VEGFR1 and that the effects could occur via cell surface toll-like receptor-3 (TLR3), its adaptor TRIF and induction of interferon-\u03b3 and interleukin-12. The use of a positive-readout reporter system would help to address some of these issues of RNAi versus TLR3 activation. For example, injection of a cocktail of siRNA targeting VEGFa or control together with siLacor control into the eyes of our reporter mice given laser-injury induced choroidal neovascularization (a model predictive of efficacy in humans) could help show if suppression of choroidal neovascularization effects were mediated by RNAi where luciferase induction would be observed or by TLR3 where no luciferase signal would be seen.",

The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and blocked in 5% dried milk in Tris-buffered saline pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) at room temperature for 60 minutes. The blot was then washed three times with TBST and incubated with mouse anti-LacI clone 9A5 primary antibody (Millipore UK, Watford, UK) diluted 1 in 1,000 at room temperature for 2 hours. The blot was then washed three times with TBST and incubated with goat antimouse IgG-HRP secondary antibody (Dako, Ely, UK) diluted 1 in 5,000 at room temperature for 1 hour. The blot was washed and the bands visualized by chemiluminescence using ECL western blotting detection reagent (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) on a ChemiImager (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA), and analyzed using Fluorchem 8000 software. Each blot was stripped and reprobed with sc-5286 anti-\u03b1-tubulin antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) diluted 1:1,000 as a protein loading control.",

HDLacOLuc transgenic mice were generated by isolating the transgenic construct from pHDLacOluc via BglII/BamHI digestion (Figure 1b) followed by PvuI digestion to leave a 2.7 kb isolated fragment which was purified and diluted to 5 ng/\u03bcl in microinjection buffer (10 mmol/l Tris-HCl pH7.4, 0.1 mmol/l EDTA). LacIR transgenic mice were generated by isolating the transgenic construct from pLacIR via KpnI/SacI partial digestion (Figure 1b) to give a 7.5 kb fragment isolated and purified as described above. Three-week-old female B6CBAF1 mice were superovulated and mated. The resulting fertilized oocytes were collected from the oviduct of plugged female mice and cultured until two clear pronuclei were visible. The purified HDLacOLuc or LacIR transgenic constructs were microinjected into one of the pronuclei and injected embryos were cultivated overnight to the two-cell stage. Two-cell embryos were then reimplanted into the oviduct of pseudo pregnant CD1 foster mothers at 0.5 days after coitum. Between 18 and 19 days later, pups were born from the foster mothers. Ear biopsies from these pups were taken, DNA extracted and PCR performed to identify transgenic founder mice. Founder mice were mated with C57BL/6J mice and the resultant pups genotyped to confirm germline transmission of the transgenes. These F1 transgenics were mated with C57BL/6J mice to produce an F2 generation and establish the line. Double transgenics were established by mating HDLacOluc F2 transgenic mice with LacIR F2 transgenic mice. Offspring were genotyped to identify individuals carrying both transgenes.",

Template DNA obtained from ear biopsies was amplified using the thermal cycling conditions; 94 \u00b0C for 15 minutes, followed by 35 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 60 seconds, 55 \u00b0C for 60 seconds, and 72 \u00b0C for 40 seconds and ending with a single completion stage of 72 \u00b0C for 5 minutes. The reaction conditions were generated in an Applied Biosystems 7000 Sequence Detection System. The standard amplification reaction contained QuantiTect Probe PCR mastermix (which includes HotStarTaqDNA Polymerase, Tris-HCl (pH8.7), KCl, (NH 4 ) SO 4 8 mmol/l MgCl 2 , dNTPs, and ROX passive reference dye) (Qiagen), to which was added 400 nmol/l forward primer and 400 nmol/l reverse primer. Two microlitres of template DNA from each sample was added. Positive controls were performed using 1-5 ng of plasmid (HDLacOLuc or LacIR) DNA, while negative controls were performed using water instead of template. As a further control, the integrity of the sample DNA was confirmed by PCR using murine Connexin 31 primers (forward primer 5\u2032-CTGGACTCTGACATGTGCACATAC, reverse primer 5\u2032-CTACATGCAGGATGACCAGCATAG).",

(a) Luciferase expression in HDLacOLuc F1 mice placed supine and analyzed using the IVIS imaging system; Individual F1 mice (660, 661, and 662) descended from the HDLacOLuc-424 founder were imaged 3 months apart to study long-term expression. 673-5, 676-5, and 677-3 are pups from the F1 generation of founders HDLacOLuc-673, HDLacOLuc-676 and HDLacOLuc-677 respectively. wt is a wild-type C57BL/6J mouse. Colors range from purple showing lowest expression through dark blue, light blue, green, yellow to red showing the highest expression. (b) Post mortem luciferase expression in the liver, fallopian tubes and ovaries, spleen, heart, kidneys, lungs, and head of mice 660, 661, and 662 (left to right); the position of each organ is illustrated. (c) Western blots illustrating lac repressor expression (a 38 kDa band as indicated) in organs from individual F1 mice descended from the LacIR-339 or LacIR-866 founder mice, or a wild-type C57BL/6J control mouse. Alpha tubulin was used as a loading control in each case. For LacIR-339 20 \u03bcg of total protein was added per lane in the top blot, which was increased 6-, 12-, and 60-fold for kidney, liver, and lungs, respectively in the bottom blot.",
