This policy approach is grounded in the knowledge that approximately 70 percent of emerging diseases in humans originate from other species, and that this species crossover is precipitated by stresses to environmental systems such as habitat change and biodiversity loss. Remote sensing tools apply well to this approach due to the multitude of variables that can be measured across borders in real-time. This paper explores the challenges and opportunities of using satellite remote sensing to monitor biodiversity loss in real time, with a goal of predictive surveillance for emerging disease events. Key findings include that (1) certain emerging disease events are preceded by biodiversity changes that can be observed from space; (2) refining quantitative assessments of biodiversity loss is a critical next step; and (3) biodiversity loss as observed from space merits inclusion in emerging disease surveillance programs as a complement to in situ and epidemiological surveillance data.",

This paper proposes the use of space-based Earth observation, as a complement to robust in situ monitoring and epidemiological surveillance, as a timely and necessary interdisciplinary approach to getting ahead of the EID curve.

The field of epidemiology is intimately linked with spatial analysis since its genesis: in 1854, as cholera decimated the Soho district of London, a physician by the name of John Snow famously began tracking the cases as they emerged on a map of the city (Fig. 1 ) [8] . Geographic clusters of individual cases quickly emerged along unique corridors of the city's streets. This methodology yielded a critical insight: the clusters occurred along shared routes of water distribution [8] . The geospatial patterns, which existed neither in the lab nor in the isolated clinical context, extended the Cartesian relationship of disease transmission into another dimension. Patterns portend predictability, which offers public health officials an opportunity to intervene.",

Real-time alert systems, such as the healthmap.org project (Fig. 2) , have expanded the scope of disease mapping by integrating a broader range of data sources through advanced text mining through newspaper reports and social media [10] .

It is critical to note that such an extrapolation would be beyond the state of what the current data support. For example, associations between ecological change and the propagation of malaria have been shown to be inconsistent, and in some cases biodiversity seems to be associated with increases in human infection rates [20] . Importantly, this example is of an endemic or established pathogen, the ecology of which no longer behaves in accordance with the body of evidence presented here. The need to distinguish between these two distinct states of infectious agents in the context of ecological change is discussed in depth by Hosseini et al. [22] , who suggest that the differences between the terms \"hazard\" and \"risk\" may play a role in misunderstandings. In the case of EIDs with origins in wildlife, diverse ecosystems present a hazard of high pathogen diversity; this paper is concerned with measuring the risk of an outbreak. While drivers of endemic infectious disease, especially vectorborne pathogens such as malaria, have shown promise as targets of remote-sensing based surveillance programs, these efforts must be considered separately from the approach described here as they involve different assumptions of both hazard and risk.",

Here, we consider ecosystem disruption in general. However, both [46] and [47] present findings that suggest disruptions are more likely to promote outbreak events when they incur in such a way as to fragment previously intact ecosystems of a certain minimum diameter. These findings are important for the remote sensing community, because adoption and refinement of EBVs can facilitate real-time measurement of tropical forest fragmentation to a more robust degree than previous methodologies. Specifically, fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation and leaf area index can supplement the methodologies utilized in these studies to broaden our scientific understanding of how ecosystem change promotes spillover events. Does loss of specific keystone species in tropical forest ecosystems, such as tree species that provide food sources to bat populations, play an outsized role in promoting zoonotic spillover, or are outbreaks more likely irrespective of the nature of the disruption? Does clearing of tree species of a certain age or density matter? Further characterization with EBVs can provide important insight into these questions.",

Advances in remote sensing and computational ability suggest that observing this disruption at a spatial and temporal resolution sufficient to provide this early warning might soon be possible. Applying satellite-based EBVs to characterize ecosystem intactness and fragmentation in real time should be the focus of future work on this topic.",

The proposed systems architecture of this surveillance tool is described in supplementary figure 1 , which describes a spatial reduction approach: beginning at the level of the geographic boundaries of pathogen risk, moderate resolution imagery can be used to define areas of ecosystem intactness, similar to [37] and expanded upon in Refs. [46] and [47] . SRS EBVs are used to identify statistically significant changes in this intactness, or fragmentation, in real time. From here, higher resolution and airborne imagery can be tasked using a \"tip and cue\" strategy to validate or invalidate alerts. Finally, positive identifications can be reported to partners in the field for manual analysis. This system is in its early stages, and we plan to incorporate system design suggestions from a wide variety of partners during the development phase.",
