Family comprises 5 genera recognized by ICTV: Influenzavirus A, Influenzavirus B, Influenzavirus C, Thogotovirus and Isavirus, and 2 proposed genera e Quaranjavirus and Influenzavirus D. Influenza A viruses are most variable of all orthomyxoviruses being the cause of influenza epidemics and pandemics. Now 18 hemagglutinin (HA) and 11 neuraminidase (NA) subtypes of influenza A virus are recognized. Most of them have waterfowl as a host. Only influenza viruses of H1, H2 and H3 subtypes are known to cause pandemics and circulate in human population for considerable time. Only sporadic cases of infection on human-animal interface by influenza A(H5), A(H6), A(H7), A(H9) and A(H10) were observed.",

In so called \"Asian flu\" pandemics in 1957e1958, caused by influenza A(H2N2) virus around 1e2 million lethal cases were registered [1] . This virus emerged in humans following antigenic shift resulting from reassortment between circulating human H1N1 influenza virus and avian H2N2 influenza viruses. This reassortant 1957 pandemic viruses possessed the HA (4), NA (6) , and PB1(2) gene segments of an avian H2N2 virus while the remaining five were of human H1N1 virus origin [2] . Pandemic started in Northern China in February 1957 [3] and in several weeks spread to South East Asia. In USSR first cases were registered in Central Asia (Tashkent, Dushanbe, Almaty), first wave of pandemic reached European part of USSR in the end of May 1957 [4] . Mortality rate in Leningrad in 1957e1959 was near 1.5% of population [5] . In 1968 influenza A(H2N2) virus was superseded by influenza A(H3N2) virus.",

In 1968 influenza A(H2N2) viruses were superseded from circulation in humans by [12] . Conventional PCR has many disadvantages in diagnostic use due to laboriousness, high risk of contamination and long turnaround time. Several protocols for influenza subtyping using conventional PCR were published [21, 22] . Recently, Hoffmann and colleagues described RITA, realtime RT-PCR assay for wide spectrum of influenza A viruses, including H2 strains [13] . Yet, we had no opportunity for experimental comparison of RITA and our protocol for influenza A(H2) detection. In this study, two sets of primers and TaqMan probes were designed based on the conserved regions of the HA gene of influenza A(H2) viruses. Conserved regions were identified by analysis of Shannon entropy distribution. Developed assays successfully passed in silico evaluation and were selected for further experimental evaluation. rRT-PCR efficiency was experimentally estimated to be around 100% fulfilling MIQE criteria for PCR assays [23] . Described primer/probe H2-1 and H2-2 sets showed different specificity on different influenza strains. H2-2 set demonstrated false positive results on some seasonal influenza A(H1N1) strains and pooled influenza positive control (PIPC). Thus H2-2 was considered to be inappropriate for use and excluded from further experimental evaluation.",

Obtained LOD is higher, than those for the real-time quantitative RT-PCR targeting the M gene, which are usually used as the \"gold standard (e.g. 10 0.3 TCID 50 /ml for H7N9 assay [24] , 10 1.3 EID 50 /ml for CDC Influenza 2009 A(H1N1)pdm Real-Time RT-PCR Panel [25] ), but we consider it acceptable for qualitative RT-PCR testing. Using artificial human specimens we demonstrated that developed H2-1 assay is suitable for use on human specimens containing diverse interfering substances. In summary, a realtime RT-PCR assay (H2-1) for detection of the influenza A(H2) viruses was designed, and was shown to have adequate sensitivity and specificity. Availability of realtime RT-PCR assays for potentially pandemic influenza viruses is important for pandemic preparedness, making easier early identification of pandemic strain.",
