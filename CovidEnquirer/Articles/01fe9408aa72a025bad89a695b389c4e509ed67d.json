Yet public health systems in developing countries are underfunded, understaffed, and in many cases struggling to deal with the existing burden of disease. As a result, developed countries are beginning to expand assistance for emergency preparedness to the developing world. Given developing countries' weak infrastructure and many competing public health priorities, it is not clear how to best direct these resources. Evidence from the U.S. and other developed countries suggests that some investments in bioterror and pandemic emergency preparedness, although initially implemented as vertical programs, have the potential to strengthen the general public health infrastructure. This experience may hold some lessons for how global funds for emergency preparedness could be invested in developing countries to support struggling public health systems in responding to current health priorities as well as potential future public health threats.

            "text": "I mproving the capacity of developing countries to respond to emerging diseases and especially influenza pandemics is essential to reduce both transmission around the globe and the human toll of outbreaks in the developing world. Investing in this capacity in developing countries is thus increasingly seen as a shared concern within the global community. As a result multilateral and bilateral donors committed a total of US$582 million in loans and grants to buttress the response capacity of developing and middle-income countries. 1 While there is broad agreement on the need for additional funding, there is less clarity on how the funds should be spent. Although the developed world has invested its bioterror-and pandemic-preparedness dollars and euros into building highly specialized emergencyresponse capacity, it is not clear whether this could or should be replicated in the developing world, where public health infrastructure is weak due to years of underinvestment and where there are urgent, competing public health priorities that by necessity take center stage. 2 This article examines the value of a multiple-use approach to emergency preparedness in the develop-ing world-one that aims to build capacity for both emergency preparedness and current core public health activities. Such an approach could offer developing countries an opportunity to strengthen their public health system platforms, allowing them to respond to multiple priority diseases rather than creating specialized programs that will likely be difficult to sustain in the longer term. First, it reviews evidence from developed countries on the impacts of emergency preparedness for bioterrorism and pandemic influenzawhich require similar public health system responseson public health departments and the overall public health system, focusing on investments proven to have substantial collateral impacts on other public health activities. It then explores how similar multiple-use investments could be made in the developing world.",

            "text": "There is growing concern that the world is facing an influenza pandemic caused by a mutated avian virus. In 2003/2004, an outbreak of the H5N1 subtype of influenza A killed or caused the destruction of 150 million birds in Asia-the largest such outbreak in history. Two hundred and five people were infected with an overall case fatality rate of 56%. 3, 4 If H5N1 or a similar virus improves the efficiency of its human-to-human transmission, such an outbreak could precipitate a major global pandemic. 1 Globally, other emerging diseases, such as Ebola, Marburg; drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB); and others are also on the rise. 5 Jungles and other ecosystems in low-and middle-income countries have frequently been the source of emerging diseases. The Ebola, Marburg and Lassa hemorrhagic fever viruses, as well as the virus responsible for Rift Valley Fever, are native to Africa. 6 H5N1 influenza spread from migratory birds in Asia to birds in Africa and Europe in 1996 -a path that could be followed by a more lethal human form of the virus. 7 At the same time, the public health infrastructures in developing countries that must contain these new threats are weak and stretched thin with the current disease burden. Indeed, health systems in the lowestincome countries suffer from insufficient health system funding, large shortages of health workers, and dilapidated infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. 8, 9 In 2003, for example, 34 of the 46 countries in the WHO African region spent less than US$34 per capita on health, the minimum amount recommended by the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, with 29 of the countries spending US$20 or less. 8, 10 As a result, many countries struggle to provide routine immunization and healthcare services for common disorders, much less offer routine surveillance of influenza-type illness.",

            "text": "Recent experience with emerging diseases suggests that weak outbreak notification and containment may lead to high mortality and morbidity. 6 In the 2000 -2001 Ebola outbreaks in Uganda, a lack of gloves, masks, and gowns, as well as inconsistent sterilization in hospitals, increased the rates of transmission of the disease to healthcare workers and other patients. 11 People who become infected often have higher fatality rates because supportive or curative treatment is not routinely available, and a lack of information about disease transmission may delay the seeking of treatment. 5 The link between poverty and high epidemic mortality is confirmed by historic experience. Vital registry data from the influenza epidemic of 1918, which likewise may have originated in birds, showed a 30-fold difference in mortality rates between some of the mostand least-developed regions of the world; this is thought to be due in large part to the effects of poverty, including the lack of supportive care, as well as poor nutrition and high levels of comorbidity. 12, 13 While experts note that even in the U.S. a major influenza epidemic would likely overwhelm the public health capacity, epidemiologic modeling suggests that if a global influenza pandemic similar to that of 1918 were to have happened in 2004, 96% of the deaths globally would have been in developing countries, with 59% in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, two of the world's poorest regions. 12, 14, 15 The mortality rate would be 1.6% in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia versus 0.2% in the wealthy countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). 12 Preparedness and Public Health Systems in the Developed World",

            "text": "The 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the subsequent release of anthrax shocked the U.S. into taking stock of the emergency response capacity of its public health systems. Significant additional funding to strengthen this capacity followed. In the U.S., the biodefense preparedness budget increased from $294 million in 2001 to $3 billion in the next year and to $5.2 billion in 2004. Of the funds committed since 2001, $3.6 billion was spent on state, local, and hospital preparedness, representing a substantial infusion of new money into public health systems that had seen little new funding in the preceding decade. 16 At the same time, the European Union (EU) established the Health Security Committee to develop a health information system, EU-wide surveillance, a database of the medicines stock, a facility to disseminate medicines and specialists, and health-specific protocols for a coordinated EU response to an attack. 17 By 2006 a growing concern about the possibility of pandemic influenza of avian origin in the U.S. led to an infusion of another $3.8 billion into preparedness activities. 18 The bulk of preparedness budgets in the U.S. was allocated to a range of related health activities intended to respond to acts of bioterror, emerging infectious diseases, and later pandemic influenza. Bioterror and pandemic preparedness investments included the upgrading of disease surveillance, hospital capacity to handle mass casualties, patient isolation systems, laboratory diagnostics for new biologic agents, and the enhancement of command and control structures as well as communication among health and emergency services agencies. 19 Public health officials became concerned that the singular focus on new threats might overshadow the traditional activities of public health departments and hospitals and weaken their ability to tackle existing challenges. 20 -23 Among the negative effects observed was the diversion of staff in hospitals and public health departments from routine activities to meetings and training sessions on preparedness, and reduced attention to nonbioterror-related concerns. Implementing new preparedness activities while maintaining ongoing activities proved to be a challenge. 20, 24 For example, the program to vaccinate health workers against smallpox-one of the most prominent bioterror-preparedness activitiescaused many health departments to defer or cancel other core public health activities, because of the burden of program work and the required monitoring for adverse effects. 17, 25 While infectious disease response may have received a boost from preparedness funding, chronic disease programs lost ground because of the diversion of managers' attention. 20 -22 However, not all preparedness funding was earmarked restrictively, and health managers were able to direct some of the preparedness funding to investments such as infrastructure-human resources and communication-which proved to have multiple uses. 19, 21 As described below, these investments were found to improve both the general functioning of public health departments and hospitals and their ability to handle traditional health threats (Table 1) .",

Yet in the developing world, even basic laboratory facilities that, according to the WHO, should be able to perform malaria microscopic evaluation and hemoglobin, HIV, and glucose testing are scarce. This is compounded by a lack of diagnostic equipment and trained technicians, weak monitoring, and inconsistent or absent standards for laboratory testing. [35] [36] [37] Ministries of Health are often unaware of the actual (as opposed to \"on paper\") functionality of a given laboratory or hospital, making response planning difficult. 38, 39 Laboratory-medicine experts have called for major investment in African laboratories, exhorting donors to build within, rather than circumvent the existing laboratory infrastructure to avoid the creation of redundant parallel systems. 35 While governments recognize the need for investments in laboratories in principle-74% of African countries have a national laboratory policy-these plans have not materialized in many countries, due in part to shortages of financial and human resources. 40 A promising example of the development of laboratory infrastructure is the Pasteur Institutes, a network of research laboratories in 30 developing countries, including some of the poorest countries in Africa: Central African Republic, Senegal, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Niger, Cameroon, and Madagascar. The Institutes conduct research on locally prevalent infectious diseases, train local scientists, and facilitate technology transfer in laboratory medicine. [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] The international community's focus on AIDS has brought substantial new resources to developing countries, particularly in Africa, and this has also translated into better laboratory capacity. Thus, 90% of African countries responding to a WHO survey reported that they now have the capacity to screen for HIV antibodies at the district level. 40 New investments could expand these laboratories' capacity to diagnose other infectious diseases.",

The need for better health data is great: The WHO estimates that it receives accurate cause-of-death statistics from only 31 of its 193 member states. 46 As a result, the WHO has launched a global partnership for improved health information systems, the Health Metrics Network. This network supports developing countries in assessing their health information systems and improving their coverage of vital registration, as well as providing training on international health information standards (e.g., ICD classification). Cambodia, for example, is working with the Health Metrics Network and the Japanese International Cooperation Agency to scan and analyze 11 million birth and death records and to conduct a national census that will, for the first time, include information about mortality and causes of death. 47 Countries such as Sierra Leone are undertaking the assessment of health information systems and making 10-year strategic plans for improvement. 48 Health information systems could also be used to gather information on the actual (rather than planned) functionality of health posts, centers, and hospitals that would be valuable for a wide range of health planning activities.",

An example of a successful approach is the Malawi emergency human resources program, a 6-year training and salaryimprovement program financed by the UK's Department for International Development (DFID). The program aims not only to increase the number of front-line health workers (Malawi has one doctor per 62,000 people) but also to build capacity within the Ministry of Health for better health system management and planning as well as analysis of health data. 61 Trained and paid community health workers who are linked to and supported by the health system can also play a vital role in surveillance, communication, and outbreak-control activities. 62, 63 Training higher-level public health personnel is also important. Pandemic planning requires mathematical modeling of disease and mortality projections and their corresponding impacts on health service utilization, health costs, and other health system process indicators. Such modeling requires epidemiologists and biostatisticians as well as health planners, economists, and administrators. The same people can also perform a wide variety of essential public health tasks, such as monitoring the incidence of priority infectious diseases (e.g., HIV/AIDS) and estimating the impact of seasonal epidemics (e.g., malaria). Health economists can assist countries in estimating the resources required to respond to an emergency and to expand the health system to tackle existing morbidity.",

For example, nearly 40% of urban Ugandan teenagers who attend high school reported looking for health information on the Internet, suggesting that it is emerging as a powerful tool for health education. 66 In many developing countries, health education materials for existing diseases, whether for the public or for health workers, are often of low quality, may not be in local languages, and are often outdated. 67 Investing in health communication would thus benefit broader health goals.",

For example, evidence is emerging that focused and locally specific media campaigns can result in the increased use of modern contraceptives. 69, 70 Other promising avenues to communicate health information include the use of soap operas, radio broadcasts, plays, and village informal communication networks, particularly in countries where literacy and access to technology are low. 71, 72 Table 1 is a summary of possible multiple-use investments in developing countries.",
