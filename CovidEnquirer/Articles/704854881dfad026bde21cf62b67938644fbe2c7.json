The objective of this study was to estimate the median amount of money ED personnel would be willing to pay for preventing nosocomial severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Methods: A contingent valuation approach with close-ended format was used. During the study period from June 15, 2003 through June 30, 2003, a convenience sample of all medical personnel working in the ED of National Taiwan University Hospital was carried out. Participants were interviewed by a standard questionnaire and were asked to choose whether or not they would pay at a specified price to purchase a hypothetical SARS vaccine. A logistic regression model was created to evaluate the relationship between willingness-to-pay and the log of the price offered in the bid questions. The median and mean amounts of willingnessto-pay were calculated. Results: A total of 115 subjects were interviewed and most were nurses (68.7%).",

Nine medical personnel developed illness that met the criteria for the World Health Organization case definition of suspected or probable SARS. 3 A comfortable protective device that is suitable for long-term usage in EDs or vaccination may be needed to fully protect medical personnel in EDs from nosocomial transmission of SARS. Until such an ideal protective device or vaccination is available, medical personnel in EDs will continue to face the psychologic stress associated with the risk of contracting a potentially fatal illness.",

            "text": "Several formats of WTP survey questions, such as open-ended questions, closed-ended questions with dichotomous choice, and payment card questions, are currently in use. Many CVM researchers still do not agree about which valuation question is the most appropriate. 4, [15] [16] [17] Open-ended questions has been used in early CVM applications but are relatively difficult to answer. A payment card valuation question is an improvement over the open-ended valuation question, but some arguments exist as to whether there are range and centering biases. 15, [18] [19] Following the recommendation and praxis of some health economic studies, [8] [9] 17, 20 the closed-ended question with dichotomous choice was used in this study. The advantage of the dichotomous choice question is that each respondent is asked a single valuation question that is relatively easy to answer. The major disadvantage is that the CVM researcher only learns the threshold of each respondent's WTP, and more sophisticated econometric methods are necessary to develop an average WTP amount. 15 Even with adjustments for some important factors, values for other populations may differ. Our results included both the median amount subjects would be willing to pay and also the corresponding percentage of gross domestic product per capita to allow comparison of our results with studies from other countries. However, as with other studies in health care, extrapolation of population results to the behavior of particular individuals must be made with caution. Participants were not actually forced to pay the amount they claimed they would have been willing to provide; 21 nonetheless, the decrease in WTP as bids increased suggests that subjects were price-sensitive, notwithstanding the hypothetical nature of this transaction.",
