JIA is a heterogeneous group of inflammatory disorders primarily affecting the musculoskeletal system. The most common symptoms of JIA are persistent joint swelling, pain and stiffness. JIA normally affects the load bearing joints of the knee and foot, with movement limited by pain [3] . Adverse outcomes can present to varying degrees regardless of disease subtype, but persistently inflamed joints are a major risk factor [4] . The main outcomes include limitation of joint function, joint structural damage due to erosions and in severe cases disability or death. JIA subtypes vary considerably in the pattern and severity of joint inflammation, disease progression and outcome.",

To effectively manage and minimize the effects of recurrent synovitis however, an early and accurate diagnosis is essential [7] . Successful clinical management can be induced in most (54%) JIA patients with polyarticular disease, using combined anti-inflammatory treatment (NSAID and Methotrexate MTX) [8] . Even so, nearly half the patients will have relapses after treatment is discontinued. The rate of relapses may be influenced by residual synovial inflammation at the time when immunosuppressive treatment is withdrawn. Once the disease is in clinical remission, it is important to know when it is possible to withdraw immunosuppressive drugs, without inducing a flare because of their potentially serious side effects [9] . For a clinician there are three main concerns: maintaining disease remission, prevention and pre-empting disease spread and ultimately averting permanent joint damage and disability. If there was a predictive test that would allow disease progression to be forecast and therefore modify treatment accordingly, significant benefit could be provided to patients.",

What is clear though, is that no single agent or process is wholly responsible, but rather the interaction of these processes resulting in a characteristic protein expression pattern with a particular inflammatory nature. Proteomics is therefore an ideal systems biology approach to examine the multifaceted processes at work in arthritis [15] . In addition multiplex diagnostics are more likely to reflect the true complexity of the arthritis disease process. Fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE) was applied in this study as the spectrally distinct Cy dye fluorophores permit multiplexing of corresponding synovial fluid and plasma from an individual patient. The inclusion of an internal pooled standard (composed of all experiment samples), on each gel allows proteome comparisons to be made between patients and biological variation between body fluids to be reliably quantified.",

On the other hand it is equally important to assess the systemic molecular foundations of the disease, which may not be clinically apparent. From a practicality viewpoint it is also preferable to be able to quantify biomarkers in plasma as it is more easily accessed with less trauma to children in particular, who may suffer repeated bouts of joint inflammation. The plasma proteome is not only composed of haemostatic proteins confined to the vascular system but also transient secretions of proteins from tissues as a part of normal developmental/aging processes or disease. The proteomic profile of plasma therefore encodes the physiological state of the tissues it is circulated around. However many authors caution that the most meaningful diagnostic plasma proteins are also likely to be found at the lowest abundance, since they are released from tissue into the blood with temporal and spatial restrictions [16] . Moving further upstream of plasma to a biofluid proximal to the disease site is therefore likely to be more fruitful in the initial phases of biomarker candidate discovery.",

Briefly, the gel spots were washed with 50 mmol/L NH 4 HCO 3 /acetonitrile (1:1), followed by dehydration with acetonitrile. The proteins were reduced in 10 mmol/L dithiothreitol/50 mmol/L NH 4 HCO 3 for 1 h at 56\u00b0C and alkylated in 55 mmol/L iodoacetamide/ 50 mmol/L NH 4 HCO 3 for 2 h at room temperature. The gel pieces were washed several times in 50 mmol/L NH 4 HCO 3 , followed by dehydration with acetonitrile. The proteins were digested overnight with trypsin (Promega, modified trypsin) at 37\u00b0C, and the resulting peptide mixtures were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass fingerprint and/or MALDI-TOF/TOF peptide sequencing at Alphalyse A/S (Odense, Denmark). The instrument used was a MALDI-TOF/TOF Autoflex III from Bruker Daltonics (Bremen, Germany). Mass spectra were acquired in the 500-3000 m/z scan range. The mass accuracy was calibrated to within 50 ppm using calibration standards (standard peptide calibration mix from Bruker Daltonics) before each run. The peaklist was generated with Bruker Daltronics Flexanalysis 3.0 software using the Sophisticated Numerical Annotation Procedure (SNAP) algorithm, a signal to noise ratio of >3, a quality factor of 20 and median baseline subtraction. The peptide masses obtained were used to query the non-redundant sequence database (NRDB-NCBI 2007.07.06) for protein identification using the Mascot database search program version 2.10.03. A list of excluded contaminant ions and species restriction was not used. The NRDB database contains 4,655,816 entries and is maintained and updated by the European Molecular Biology Laboratory. Database search parameters considered: (i) that the trypsin enzyme cleaves on the C-terminal side of KR unless next residue is P, (ii) no fixed modifications, (iii) carbamidomethyl cysteine and oxidation methionine variable modifications, (iv) up to 1 missed cleavage permitted with no fixed modifications (v) peptide tolerance set at 60 ppm for the precursor ions and (vi) 0.7 Da mass tolerance for the fragment ions. The acceptance criteria for PMF based identifications was a minimum Mascot score of 50, using a 95% confidence interval threshold (p < 0.05). The peptide ions identified in this study by MALDI-TOF and further CID MS/MS analysis independently matched to single protein entries in the database. Protein identifications were independently verified at Queen's University Belfast by nanoelectrospray-ionization (nESI-MS/MS) from a similar Coommassie colloidal blue stained gel. Digested peptides were extracted in 5% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile in ultrapure water with sonication for 6 min. After a gel pellet was formed by brief centrifugation, the supernatant was desalted using a C18 ZipTip (Pierce Biotechnology Inc., Rockford, USA) and dehydrated in SC 210A Speed Vac vacuum evaporator (Savant Instruments Inc., Hicksville, USA). Desalted peptide digests were subjected to nESI-MS/MS with a LCQ Deca ion trap-mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, USA), operated with dynamic exclusion via LCQ Tune software (version 1.1). MS/MS data was recorded over a 400-2000 m/z scan range, with positive polarity and 35 kV collision energy. MS/MS data was collected by Xcalibur (version 1.1) and integrated using the Interactive Chemical Information System (ICIS) peak detection algorithm software provided by Finnigan as default. MS/MS ion search was performed by Mascot search engine (version 2.10.03) (Matrix Science Inc., Boston, USA), using the database NCBInr (2007.05.12) containing 4,914,404 sequences. The following are the standard search parameters: (i) trypsin cleavage, (ii) no fixed modifications, (iii) no constraints on protein mass or mass value, (iv) peptide and MS/MS tolerances set at 1.2 and 0.6 Da, respectively and (v) peptide charge was set at 2+ and up to 1 missed cleavage permitted.

A certain amount of 'leakiness' between the two fluids could be anticipated due to a breakdown in the integrity of the synovial capillary network, commonly observed in a range of rheumatic disorders as joint inflammation progresses [34] . The signal from a particular biomarker is likely to diminish with distance from the disease and in particular with dilution into the plasma.

Continuous drainage from and replenishment into the intra-articular space ensures the synovial fluid proteome remains in flux [33] . Although capillary ultrafiltrate is the base solution for synovial fluid, secretions are made by the local synovial lining cells. Size selectivity has been proposed on the theory that the hyaluronan lining the synovial space is able to filter proteins such as albumin by steric exclusion [35] . The rate of trans-synovial fluid loss and molecular sieving effects are determined by the chain length of hyaluronan concentrated at the synovial membrane surface [36] . Our observation of albumin isoforms at variable stages of degradation across synovial fluid and plasma may reflect molecular sieving between the synovial endothelium and the joint fluid or a differential rate of degradation between the two fluids.",

By virtue of the definition of the extended oligoarticular patient subgroup (become polyarticular after 6 months of initial diagnosis) we consider that both prediction of disease evolution and subgroup discrimination are possible by the proposed protein biomarker panel. The ability to predict disease course would be a powerful tool in the limitation of adverse outcome such as disease extension, as it may flag such patients for more effective/aggressive treatment strategies at an earlier stage in the disease process than is currently possible. The authors consider the collection of samples at the earliest stage in the disease course an important feature of the current study and vital in the discovery of biomarkers which not only 'describe' the initial disease processes, but may also act as sentinels to predict subsequent disease outcome. By cataloguing the protein profiles and identities which best describe the joint status as disease progresses, it may also be possible to monitor therapeutic response over time. Furthermore joint proteome records could help predict disease spread and joint damage. Considering the heterogeneity of patient outcome in JIA, therapeutic suppression of synovial joint inflammation, while neglecting the systemic components of chronic disease, may not represent the best possible way to manage nonresponsive disease. Longer lasting remission could be possible by taking systemic sentinels into account.",

The differences noted are currently being validated with a larger independent patient cohort, where alternate methods of expression and functional analysis will be used to further corroborate the proteomic findings. The proteins identified could act as criteria to prevent disease extension to allow earlier, more aggressive therapeutic intervention.",
