We examined the hypothesis that bacteria and viruses may modulate this heterogeneity and that interactions between bacterial and viral infection may affect changes in airway bacterial load and the clinical features and inflammatory responses of exacerbations in patients with COPD. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Outpatient Department, London Chest Hospital, London, UK. Patients: Thirty-nine patients with COPD. Measurements: We prospectively studied 56 COPD exacerbations, obtaining clinical data and paired sputum and serum samples at baseline and exacerbation. Qualitative and quantitative microbiology, polymerase chain reaction detection for rhinovirus, and estimation of cytokine levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were performed. Results: A total of 69.6% of exacerbations were associated with a bacterial pathogen, most commonly Haemophilus influenzae. Rhinovirus was identified in 19.6% of exacerbations. The rise in bacterial load at exacerbation correlated with the rise in sputum interleukin (IL)-8 (r \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.37, p \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.022) and fall in FEV 1 (r \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.35, p \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.048). Exacerbations with both rhinovirus and H influenzae had higher bacterial loads (10 8.56 cfu/mL vs 10 8.05 cfu/mL, p \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.018) and serum IL-6 (13.75 pg/mL vs 6.29 pg/mL, p \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.028) than exacerbations without both pathogens. In exacerbations with both cold symptoms (a marker of putative viral infection) and a bacterial pathogen, the FEV 1 fall was greater (20.3% vs 3.6%, p \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.026) and symptom count was higher (p \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.019) than those with a bacterial pathogen alone.",

The remainder was analyzed for inflammatory cyto-kines. 2, 11, 13 Sputum interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Systems; Abingdon, UK). 2 Contemporaneous blood samples were obtained, centrifuged at 4\u00b0C, and serum decanted and stored at \u03ea 80\u00b0C for subsequent analysis of IL-6 levels using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Systems).",

Correlations were assessed using the Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficient (two tailed), as appropriate. Continuous variables with normal distributions were compared by t test, whereas those with nonnormal distributions were compared by the Mann-Whitney U or Wilcoxon signed-ranks test. Changes in parameters from the stable state to exacerbation were assessed using a paired analysis of the stable sample data taken preceding the exacerbation studied; p values \u0545 0.05 were regarded as significant. In the analysis of changes in parameters between stable state and exacerbation, the prior stable sampling point closest to the subjects corresponding exacerbation was used creating a data set of paired baseline and exacerbation samples for each exacerbation. The analysis of group data was initially adjusted for repeated measures by selecting the first exacerbation sampled per patient (n \u03ed 39) to assess the changes in measured indexes from baseline to exacerbation. These observed changes were comparable to the larger data set of 56 exacerbations (in 39 patients), which was therefore used to compare individual exacerbation characteristics and etiologies, as in previous studies. 5 Multivariate analysis was performed using a multiple linear regression analysis. Data analysis was performed using statistical software (SPSS version 10.0; SPSS; Chicago, IL). Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the 39 patients in the East London COPD Cohort sampled during the study. Fifty-six paired stable and exacerbation samples were obtained from 39 patients for this analysis. Of these 39 patients, 15 were receiving long-term oxygen therapy, all patients were receiving long-term inhaled corticosteroids (median, 500 g/d; IQR, 400 to 1,500 g/d of beclomethasone equivalents), no patients were receiving long-term oral corticosteroids, and all patients received regular inhaled bronchodilators. The remainder of the patients did not have an exacerbation during the sampling period (n \u03ed 26), did not report an exacerbation to the study team, received antibiotic treatment before sampling, or were unable to provide an adequate sputum sample (n \u03ed 14). The sampled patients did not differ significantly in terms of baseline characteristics from those who were not sampled (Table 1) . Table 2 shows the stable and exacerbation FEV 1 , airway bacterial load, sputum IL-6 and IL-8, and blood IL-6 levels for all the 56 sampled exacerbations and on a per-patient basis (n \u03ed 39). In both analyses, the mean FEV 1 fell at exacerbation and the mean airway bacterial load rose significantly. Exacerbations were associated with increased airway inflammation in terms of sputum IL-8. The rises in levels of sputum and serum IL-6 did not reach statistical significance.",

The findings demonstrate that changes in lower airway bacterial load are associated with the variability in inflammation and lung function seen at exacerbation in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, effects that were more pronounced in proven rhinoviral and putative viral infections. These data also suggest that pathogens associated with more severe exacerbations, such as H influenzae, may act at least in part via a greater stimulus to inflammation, associated with higher airway bacterial loads. Patients with more severe disease in this study demonstrated greater rises in airway and systemic inflammation than those with milder disease.

A relationship between airway inflammation and airway bacterial load has previously been described in the stable state, 1,16 -22 with higher loads associated with greater falls in FEV 1 over a 1-year study. 11 A number of previous studies 8, 18, 19 have identified that bacterial pathogens are commonly found in the lower airway at exacerbation with higher loads than in the stable state. 9 However, the effect of rising numbers of bacteria on the nature of exacerbations has not been investigated. These findings suggest that changes in bacterial load may play a role in the heightened levels of airway inflammation characteristic of exacerbations. However, evidence for an association between changes in bacterial load and indexes of exacerbation severity does not prove causality; it is possible that changes in airway bacterial load may simply be a secondary phenomenon to other causes of inflammation. Indeed, the findings of this study show that the key changes in symptoms and lung function at exacerbation were observed when the synergistic effects of viral and bacterial infection were found. In vitro and intervention studies are required to differentiate the exact contribution of a particular pathogen or pathogens to the inflammatory and pathophysiologic changes at exacerbation.",

These findings compliment previous work 19 of the role that strain changes of particular bacterial species play in the etiology of exacerbations. This has identified the role that a new antigenic stimulus to the airway immune system plays in the pathogenesis of an exacerbation. It is feasible that acquisition of a new bacterial strain or type may not only provide a direct antigenic stimulus but also overcome the established host/pathogen balance allowing bacterial proliferation, and thus a further inflammatory stimulus due to greater bacterial numbers. To date, studies to determine the possible interactions between viral infection and bacterial strain changes have not been performed; these may provide information on the complex mechanisms that result in triggering exacerbations.",

In our cohort of influenza-vaccinated patients, we have previously demonstrated that HRV is the most commonly isolated virus at exacerbation. 5 Rhinovirus can be isolated from lower airway samples 6 and is associated with greater levels of inflammation than nonviral infections. 6 Similarly, we have shown that colds, a marker of putative viral infections, 6 are associated with more severe exacerbations. In this study, systemic inflammation (serum IL-6), exacerbation symptoms, and lung function changes were all more severe when evidence for both bacterial and viral infection was present. It is possible that this effect may have been due to the separate additional inflam-matory stimuli of two separate pathogens in the airway; however, this explanation is not supported by the multivariate analysis that indicated a synergistic effect on lung function in addition to the individual effects of each pathogen type. Furthermore, these exacerbations were associated with higher bacterial loads than when both pathogens were not present, which may suggest a synergistic interactive effect of viral infection which allows greater proliferation of airway bacteria. Viral infection therefore may impact on exacerbation severity indirectly by increasing bacterial load in addition to the direct effects of viral infection itself, eg, heightened inflammation or airway hyperresponsiveness, independent of other pathogens. While HRV is the most common virus identified at exacerbation 5 and hence the target of investigation in this study, a number of other respiratory viruses have been identified in the airway during these events, for example coronavirus. 5, 7 The role of these other viral pathogens and atypical bacteria at exacerbation remains uncertain 24, 25 and requires investigation.",

The role of bacterial infection and therefore potential bacterial-viral interaction is likely to vary with disease severity and therefore prevalence of bacterial colonization. 10, 18 Indeed, we have shown that the degree of airway and systemic inflammatory response at exacerbation was related to baseline disease severity. This suggests that the severity of inflammatory response may progress with disease severity, which is in agreement with the findings of a longitudinal analysis 31 of exacerbations. Further studies are required to determine if these findings can be extrapolated to COPD patients with milder disease. Indeed, the observed heterogeneity of exacerbations is likely to be further modulated by the relative frequency of particular pathogens and hence may show seasonality; this may explain differences in associated cytokine responses found in studies 2 of comparable sample size. Similarly, differences in the technique of sampling, spontaneous or induced sputum, may affect the observed results. However, we have previously demonstrated the two techniques are comparable in assessing lower airway inflammation. 13 Therapy must also be considered important when considering factors modulating inflammatory responses. The patients sampled for this study were all receiving inhaled steroids both at baseline and when sampled at exacerbation. It is possible that the inflammatory responses observed at exacerbation were modified by effects of this treatment. 32 A statistical analysis of this effect was not feasible due to the ubiquity of inhaled steroid use in this patient group. Therefore, the modulating influences on the nature of exacerbations are numerous. It is probable that any individual factor plays a contributing rather than a definitive role in determining the nature and severity of a particular exacerbation, and furthermore that potential interactions between these factors further modulate the characteristics of these events.",
