Two samples were positive for >1 common respiratory viruses, and PIV was not detected (online Appendix Table, available from www.cdc.gov/EID/ content/15/5/806-appT.htm). The age of the patients infected with the newly described viruses ranged from 4 months to 11 years (median 2.7 years). The most frequent clinical symptoms were fever, rhinorrhea, cough, sore throat, wheezing, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia (Table) . Although the specimens were collected from symptomatic children and a wide range of viruses were screened for by highly sensitive methods, less than one third of the samples were positive. Perhaps if we had collected nasopharyngeal swabs or aspirates, the percentage of samples that tested positive would have been higher.",

However, the effect of the so-called emerging respiratory viruses on the children of Brazil is yet to be clarifi ed. Few studies have demonstrated the circulation of HMPV among Brazilian children (4, 14) , and to our knowledge, none have described the circulation of HBoV, HCoV, or HPyVs as respiratory pathogens in Brazil, although 1 study did report the presence of HBoV in the stools of Brazilian children with gastroenteritis (15) . Our fi nding that HMPV, HBoV, HCoV-HKU1 or HCoVB-NL63, or the newly described KIPyV or WUPyV was present in 9.2% of the tested samples suggests that these viruses could be important respiratory pathogens in the country. However, further investigative studies that include appropriately matched control groups will be necessary to demonstrate that these novel viruses act as etiologic agents of respiratory disease in Brazil.
