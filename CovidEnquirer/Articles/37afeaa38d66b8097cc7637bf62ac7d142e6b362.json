            "text": "To have epidemic potential, a pathogen must be able to spread in human populations, but of human-infective RNA viruses only a minority can do so. We investigated the evolution of human transmissibility through parallel analyses of 1755 virus genome sequences from 39 RNA virus genera. We identified 57 lineages containing human-transmissible species and estimated that at least 74% of these lineages have evolved directly from non-human viruses in other mammals or birds, a public health threat recently designated \"Disease X\". Humantransmissible viruses rarely evolve from virus lineages that can infect but not transmit between humans. This result cautions against focussing surveillance and mitigation efforts narrowly on currently known human-infective virus lineages and supports calls for a better understanding of RNA virus diversity in non-human hosts.",

Therefore, we did not attempt a discrete traits analysis for host range 125 but compared the known non-human hosts for L2 and L3/4 viruses at the species/subtype and 126 genus levels (see Supplementary Materials). At the species/subtype level human viruses also 127 found in non-human primates were most likely to be L3/4 rather than L2; those also found in 128 birds were least likely (Figure 4) . At the genus level the pattern was similar (Spearman's rank 129 correlation of coefficient estimates by host category = +0.89, P<0.01) but the confidence In keeping with earlier work 15 , we used RNA-dependent RNA polymerase protein-based 136 phylogenies in our main analysis. However, we tested the possibility that alternative 137 phylogenies would generate different numbers and distributions of transitions between traits 138 by constructing alternatives trees based on surface protein sequences ( Figure S8 ). We obtained 139 results that differed minimally from our main analysis, most importantly that an estimated 71% 140 of L3/4 lineages have L1 ancestors (see Data File 9) .",

Our selection procedure resulted in a data set with only 145 28% of virus sequences from human hosts, but it is still likely that the phylogenetic diversity 146 of viruses from non-human hosts is greatly underestimated relative to that from humans 3,14 , 147 noting that for many mammal/bird taxa no RNA viruses at all have yet been reported. There 148 will also be gaps in our knowledge of IT level: some viruses originally classified as L1 have 149 been subsequently found to human infective; and some viruses originally classified as L2 have 150 been subsequently found to be human transmissible as epidemiological data accumulates 6 . As 151 new virus sequences are added and IT levels are assigned or (occasionally) re-assigned it is 152 entirely possible that the estimated ancestors of some L3/4 viruses will change. However, we 153 anticipate that the impact of such changes across the whole data set will be to strengthen our 154 main conclusions. This is because we anticipate that far more L1 viruses will be added than 155 L2, and more L2 than L3/4, continuing the current trend ( Figure S1 ). For this reason, we 156 consider our estimate that 74% of L3/4 viruses arose from L1 lineages to be conservative.",

Viruses circulating in the non-human reservoir may not be infective to humans (L1) or have the potential to infect or infect and transmit between humans (L2 and L3/4 respectively). Virus lineages in the reservoir may acquire (thick grey arrows showing rates a, b and c) or lose (thin grey arrows) the capacities to infect and/or transmit in humans through genetic drift -these traits are not under direct selection in the non-human reservoir. L2 and L3/4 viruses in non-human hosts may cross the species barrier and enter human populations. L3/4 (but not L2) viruses may then spread and evolve independently in the human population (multiple grey arrows).
