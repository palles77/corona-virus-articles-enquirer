One hundred and three serum or plasma samples were selected and tested: 70 were positive by both tests, 24 were negative by both tests. The in-practice test produced five false positive and four false negative results. The sensitivity of the in-practice test was 95% and the specificity was 83%. When the titres were compared it was found that the in-practice test results were significantly correlated with IFA titres but the degree of correlation was not likely to be clinically useful. The IFA titres of the four false negative samples were found to be low (less than 40) which suggests that even a cat with a false negative result is still unlikely to be excreting FCoV.",

These kits contain combs of test strips: each test strip has three reaction areas: a positive control, a negative control and the test area (see Fig. 1 ). The kits were stored in a refrigerator at 4\u00b0C, as per the manufacturer's instructions. Five kits used were from one batch and 5 kits were from a second batch. The kits were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The kits were brought to room temperature before use. The samples to be tested were thawed to room temperature. Five microlitres of sample were added to each sample well, and the test was run as per the manufacturer's instructions. The comb was dipped in a series of wells for specific lengths of time, and agitated vertically every 2 minutes. When the reaction was completed the comb was allowed to dry before being read by comparison with a colour scale supplied with each kit (Fig. 2) . A reading of 1 to 6 was obtained by comparing the shade of grey of the dot with that of the card. As this is a subjective assessment, two independent readers were used. The positive control dot was aligned with the reading of 3, so that readings of 3 or over were considered positive, readings of 2.5 or less were considered negative. The manufacturers classification of 'low positive' for values greater than 0 but less than 2.5 was not used as early experiences with the kit had suggested that these were usually negative on IFA. Dots that appeared darker than level 6 were counted as 6.",

The value will vary according to the prevalence of FCoV in the practice and the intended use of the kit. The most useful application of this test is likely to be in the screening of cats before entry into FCoV-free households. As the false negative cats had low IFA titres and these are associated with a relatively low prevalence of virus shedding it therefore follows that the false negative results are less of a problem. We would not recommend putting an Immunocomb positive cat into a FCoV-free household as there is approximately a 33% risk that he or she will be excreting virus (Addie and Jarrett, 2001) . The Immunocomb only missed 4 of 81 seropositive samples. Thus the Immunocomb is an adequate screening test for testing cats for entry into FCoV free households.",

This is because of the poor correlation and the inability to clearly distinguish between high and low or moderate titres. For example, the finding that an IFA titre fell from 1280 to 320 to 40 over a period of time would indicate that the cat was in the process of eliminating a FCoV infection and should be isolated from sources of re-infection. The Immunocomb could not detect that change. IFA is recommended for this purpose.",
