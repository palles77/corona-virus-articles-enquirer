With the increase of concentration of Triton X-100 in the system, the intrinsic fluorescence intensity, synchronous fluorescence intensity, fluorescence polarization, zeta potential, and morphology of Hb all changed gradually, and the ribavirin located on the Hb surface was dissociated and released out. When the concentration of Triton X-100 was higher than 1\u00d710 \u22125 mol\u22c5L \u22121 , the stronger interaction of Triton X-100 with Hb was predominant.",

The site of the interaction and association is mainly at the residues of the alkaline amino acid [1, 2] . Generally, the interaction is mostly electrostatic action, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic action, and van der Waal force [3, 4] .

An isosbestic point is reached at approximately 550 nm. So, ribavirin affects on Hb structure, i.e., the content of metHb increases but the content of hemichrome decreases. There does not appear new absorption peak, which implies that ribavirin and Hb may not form a complex. The absorption peak of ribavirin appears only at 208 nm.

When c R reaches approximately 2.5\u00d710 \u22125 mol\u22c5L \u22121 , the intensity changes little. On one hand, there is a furan ribose group and a ternary-nitrogen imidazole in ribavirin molecule. So, the interaction of ribavirin with Hb involves hydrophilic action and hydrogen bonding. Ribavirin changes the Hb micro-environment and the residues of the amino acids move into the inner of Hb. These lead to the decrease in fluorescence intensity. On the other hand, ribavirin may be adsorbed or located on Hb surface, which causes the residues of Hb to be partially shielded. These also lead to the decrease of fluorescence intensity. At high ribavirin concentration, the interaction and the shield gradually reach a saturation point and equilibrium.

These indicate that Triton X-100 can modulate the Hb structure from metHb to hemichrome and can lead to the partial recovery of the original structure of Hb. In the Hb/ribavirin/H 2 O system, the intrinsic fluorescence intensity and the synchronous fluorescence intensities of Hb at \u2206\u03bb=15 nm and \u2206\u03bb=60 nm increase gradually with the increase of Triton X-100 concentration (Fig.7) .

When Triton X-100 concentration increases to (2\u22125)\u00d710 \u22126 mol\u22c5L \u22121 , all the intensities can be almost returned to that while Hb solely exists in the same concentration of Hb.

In the Hb/ribavirin/H 2 O system, the polarization increases first slowly and then rapidly with Triton X-100 concentration (Fig. 8) . The decrease in interaction between ribavirin and Hb makes the freedom of movement of Hb and the polarization increases. On one hand, when Triton X-100 is added to the system, ribavirin located on the Hb surface is released out. On the other hand, the viscosity of the system increases with the increase of Triton X-100 concentration. The decrease of the freedom of movement of Hb also results in the increase in polarization. Therefore, the polarization apparently changes slightly if Triton X-100 is less than 5\u00d710 \u22126 mol\u22c5L \u22121 . When the concentration of Triton X-100 is larger than 1\u00d710 \u22125 mol\u22c5L \u22121 , the effect of Triton X-100 is predominant, and the polarization shows an obvious change. Fig.9 shows the effects of Triton X-100 on the zeta potential of Hb and the system conductivity in the Hb/ribavirin/Triton X-100/H 2 O system. With the increase of Triton X-100 concentration, the zeta potential decreases rapidly at first and then slowly. The Triton X-100 can decrease the dielectric constant of the system, thereby resulting in the release of ribavirin. The tryptophan and tyrosine wrapped in the interior of Hb by ribavirin are drawn back to the original states by the stronger interaction of Triton X-100 with Hb. Therefore, the negative charge and zeta potential of Hb decrease and the conductivity increases. The Hb structure may gradually return to the original state. When Triton X-100 concentration increases to the range of (2\u22125)\u00d710 \u22126 mol\u22c5L \u22121 , the zeta potential rebounds to its original value. If the Triton X-100 concentration is very high, the stronger interaction of Triton X-100 with Hb is the most dominant. The zeta potential shows a continuous decrease.",

Fig.11 shows that the Hb concentration depends on the Triton X-100 concentration, c T (rc), required to recover completely the Hb behavior in the system. c T (rc) increases linearly with Hb concentration. The slope of the straight line is approximately 1.5, from which it is obvious that the binding of Hb with a particular number of Triton X-100 results in the recovery of the behaviors of Hb. In addition, the linear relationship indicated by the line that passed through the origin point indicates that most of the Triton X-100 added is bound to the protein. The mixing ratios at low Triton X-100 concentration can be regarded as the actual binding number of the surfactant, i.e., 1.5. The Triton X-100 molecules are bound to an Hb molecule. The binding is not steady because no new peak is found in the Fig.9 Zeta potential (a) and system conductivity (b) vary with Triton X-100 concentration in Hb/ribavirin/Triton X-100/H2O system UV-Vis and fluorescence spectra of Hb. As is well known, the binding behaviors of a surfactant to a protein were extensively examined in the initial stage. The present statement is slightly contradictory to the results reported so far: even over a low surfactant-concentration range, the binding to a protein has generally been accepted to proceed according to an equilibrium relationship with a free surfactant monomer of a particular concentration. Here, it should be noted that the above estimation is made using the changes in behavior of the protein induced by the binding of the surfactant.",

When ribavirin concentration increases to approximately 82% of the total ribavirin concentration, f r shows a slow and nonlinear increase. Some molecules of ribavirin embedded in Hb are still released out because more Triton X-100 induces changes in the Hb structure.
