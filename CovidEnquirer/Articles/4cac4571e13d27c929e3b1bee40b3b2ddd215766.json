            "text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe form of acute lung injury. It is a response to various diseases of variable etiology, including SARS-CoV infection. To date, a comprehensive study of the genomic physiopathology of ARDS (and SARS) is lacking, primarily due to the difficulty of finding suitable materials to study the disease process at a tissue level (instead of blood, sputa or swaps). Hereby we attempt to provide such study by analyzing autopsy lung samples from patient who died of SARS and showed different degrees of severity of the pulmonary involvement. We performed real-time quantitative PCR analysis of 107 genes with functional roles in inflammation, coagulation, fibrosis and apoptosis; some key genes were confirmed at a protein expression level by immunohistochemistry and correlated to the degree of morphological severity present in the individual samples analyzed. Significant expression levels were identified for ANPEP (a receptor for CoV), as well as inhibition of the STAT1 pathway, IFNs production and CXCL10 (a T-cell recruiter). Other genes unassociated to date with ARDS/SARS include C1Qb, C5R1, CASP3, CASP9, CD14, CD68, FGF7, HLA-DRA, IGF1, IRF3, MALAT-1, MSR1, NFIL3, SLPI, USP33, CLC, GBP1 and TAC1. As a result, we proposed to therapeutically target some of these genes with compounds such as ANPEP inhibitors, SLPI and dexamethasone. Ultimately, this study may serve as a model for future, tissue-based analyses of fibroinflammatory conditions affecting the lung.",

It is associated with SARS-CoV infection and characterized by pulmonary oedema, accumulation of inflammatory cells and resulting severe hypoxia. ARDS can initiate the activation of local inflammatory mediators that eventually spill over into the general circulation and resulting a systemic inflammatory response (SIR) (Bhatia and Moochhala, 2004) . As a consequence of SIR, an excessive cytokinemediated systemic leukocytes activation will lead to the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Owing to the development of ARDS, SARS-CoV infected patients often suffered from MODS, thus explaining its high mortality. Therefore, it is crucial to elucidate the key inflammatory mediators in ARDS to characterize novel therapeutic targets ultimately aiming to stop or ameliorate the disease progression.",

In this study, we characterize the inflammatory mediators involved in the development of ARDS in SARS-CoV infected patients by investigating the gene expression profiles linked to the physiopathological changes occurring in the lung. We show 26 genes that are significantly up-regulated and 5 genes that are significantly downregulated in the progression of the disease.

(mean expression \u22651.5) in the disease samples versus the control samples (refer Table 3 ). We used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to study the functionality of these over-expressed genes (refer Supplementary 2). From this list of 92 genes, the statistical analysis showed 26 genes significantly (p < 0.05) over-expressed and 5 genes significantly (p < 0.05) suppressed (refer Figs. 3 and 4, Table 4 ) in the progression of disease (early versus late disease stage). As summarized in Table 4 , the transcriptome of SARS-CoV infected patients in late disease stage was characterized by the high expression of genes coding for chemokine (IL-8), complement component (C1QB), antibacterial response protein (TLR2), cytokine receptor (IL1R1 and TNFSF5), apoptosis-related cystein protease (CASP3 and CASP9), immunoglobulin receptor family member (CD4 and CD14), growth factors (FGF7 and IFG1), transcription factors (IRF3 and NFIL3), major histocompatibility complex antigen (HLA-DRA), receptors (ANPEP, C5R1 and MSR1), protease (HP, USP33 and SLPI), cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM8) and genes of miscellaneous functions (BPI, CD68, MALAT-1, RAB31 and S100A8). In contrast, notably low expression levels of cytokine (CLC and CXCL10), cell adhesion molecule (ITGA2B), transcription factor (STAT1) and protease (GBP) were found in patients of late disease stage. Through the use of Ingenuity \u00ae Pathway Analysis, we demonstrated that the list of over-expressed genes were involved in immunological response (refer Fig. 5 ). Only a handful of genes appeared to be involved in this network analysis (with known and reported functionality), hence it highlights the novel insights in our study that majority of the over-expressed genes with important roles in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection still remains unreported.",

Here, we will discuss the roles and importance of the list of genes that are up-or down-regulated in the pathogenesis of ARDS in SARS-CoV infections. In our study, bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) appears as the highest expressed gene in the late disease stage. It is a major constituent of neutrophils with anti-inflammatory properties and plays an integral part in innate immunity (Elsbach, 1998) . Interleukin-8 (IL-8), another gene that is significantly overexpressed in disease samples, has been reported to cause airway inflammation and plays the role as neutrophilic activator in the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis. IL-8 has been also shown to upregulate in the lung samples of SARS-CoV infected macaques (de Lang et al., 2007) . Reports by Aichele et al. (2006) showed both BPI and IL-8 were released from neutrophils in a time-dependent manner following bacterial encounter in cystic fibrosis patients. In accordance to these studies, our data demonstrates up-regulation of BPI and IL-8 in SARS-CoV infections, presumably in an attempt to activate the immune response to combat the SARS-CoV infections.",
