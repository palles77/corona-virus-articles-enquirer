Although still an evolving process, computational models now play instrumental roles, not only in directing the selection of key experiments, but also in the formulation of new testable hypotheses through detailed analysis of complex immunologic data that could not be achieved using traditional approaches alone. Immunomics, which combines traditional immunology with computer science, mathematics, chemistry, biochemistry, genomics and proteomics for the large-scale analysis of immune system function, offers new opportunities for future bench-to-bedside research.

            "text": "The need to handle this rapidly growing immunological resource has given rise to the field known as immunoinformatics. Immunoinformatics, otherwise known as computational immunology, is now an essential component of modern immunology research. It lies at the interface between computer science and experimental immunology, and represents the use of computational methods and resources for the understanding, generation, processing, and propagation of immunological information. Historically, immunoinformatics began over 90 years ago with the theoretic modeling of malaria epidemiology [1] . At that time, the emphasis was on the use of mathematics to guide the study of disease transmission. Since then, the field has expanded to cover all other aspects of immune system processes and diseases. Immunomics, which combines traditional immunology with computer science, mathematics, chemistry, biochemistry, genomics and proteomics for large-scale analysis of immune system functions, offers new opportunities for future bench-to-bedside research. Computational systems immunology, which aims to study the complex protein-protein interactions and networks, allows a better understanding of immune responses and their role during normal, disease and reconstitution states. Syndromic surveillance, which focuses on monitoring disease trends using health-related data, allows early detection and response to potential outbreaks. This article provides an introduction to the growing literature in this area, with special emphasis on the latest trends and future directions. [2, 3] The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotype influences individual immune responses against specific antigens. As of January 2009, 3304 alleles had been identified and deposited in the IMGT/HLA Database [4] . Since a fully heterogeneous indivi-dual may possess up to six different HLA class I alleles and an equal number of class II alleles, the theoretical number of HLA haplotypes is greater than 10 12 . Binding studies showed that HLA class I binding peptides and the core of class II binding peptides are Drug Discovery Today Volume 14, Numbers 13/14 July 2009 REVIEWS predominantly nine amino acids long. Consequently, the number of potential nonameric peptide candidates easily exceeds 10 11 . The astronomically high diversity of the immune system components, and also the complexity of its regulatory pathways, demands new approaches for accelerating immunology research. An immunoinformatics strategy, which combines database design, mathematical modeling and high-performance computing, provides a highly parallel, rational solution and works effectively on a massive scale.",

A total of 27 immunological databases are currently (January 2009) described in the Nucleic Acids Research Molecular Biology Database Collection (http://www3.oup.co.uk/nar/database/c/). Some of these databases are reviewed below (Table 1) . Immune epitope databases [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] are useful for major histocompatibility complex (MHC), TR and IG-binding analysis, with direct implications in component vaccine design and analysis of host-pathogen interactions. Important sources of MHC ligand data include the SYFPEITHI database [5] , which contains >4500 records of MHC ligand data and peptide motifs; the HIV Molecular Immunology Database [7] , which stores information on 905 HIV-1 cytotoxic T cell epitopes, 1023 HIV-1 helper T cell epitopes and 1448 antibody-binding sites and the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) [10] , which records data related to IG and T cell epitopes for humans, non-human primates, rodents, and other animal species. Immune sequence databases are valuable for research in autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases, cancer, immunotherapy and immunoprophylaxis. IMGT 1 , the international ImMunoGe-neTics information system 1 (http://imgt.org), serves as a central resource for IG, TR, MHC, and related proteins of the immune system of human and other vertebrates [11] . IMGT contains five databases: (1) IMGT/LIGM-DB [12] with 132,746 IG and TR sequences from human and 232 vertebrate species; (2) IMGT/ MHC-DB with sequences of 2292 HLA class I alleles, 1,012 HLA class II alleles, and 106 non-HLA alleles; (3) IMGT/GENE-DB [13] with 1922 genes and 2988 alleles of human, mouse, rat and rabbit IG and TR genes; (4) IMGT/PRIMER-DB with 1864 primer records of IG and TR from 11 species; and (5) IMGT/3Dstructure-DB [14] with 1562 records of IG, TR, and MHC proteins with known 3D structures. The Immuno Polymorphism Database (IPD) [15] consists of four specialist databases: (1) IPD-KIR contains the allelic sequences of 233 killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors; (2) IPD-MHC details the MHC sequences of a number of different species; (3) IPD-HPA stores data which define the human platelet antigens; (4) IPD-ESTAB provides access to the European Searchable Tumour Cell-Line Database (ESTDAB), a cell bank of immunologically characterized melanoma cell lines.",

The availability of experimental data is a necessity for developing efficient and robust machine-learning models to predict various molecular targets. Methods based on structure-guided design are likely to become very powerful in the years to come, with the rapid increase in structural data generated by molecular biology initiatives. Cellular automata that utilize sophisticated mathematical formulae to describe a wide range of complex virus-host relations were also reported. Specific examples include simulating cognate recognition and response in the immune system [30] , modeling B cell maturation [31] , and analyzing MHC polymorphism under host-pathogen co-evolution [32] .",

A successful example was the worldwide eradication of smallpox. The aim of vaccination is to prime the immune system in order to generate immunological memory so that a heightened immune response will be mounted upon exposure to the specified pathogen. Vaccines may be live attenuated whole organisms, killed micro-organisms, subunit antigens or toxoids. Vaccines based on killed pathogens may fail if the pathogen is denatured by extreme heat or chemical reactions. While it is possible to design attenuated vaccines using weakened forms of pathogens, subunit or peptide-based vaccines is generally preferred to reduce the risk of adverse reaction such as clinical manifestation of disease. In the past decade, computational methods for mapping immunogenic epitopes have been actively developed to facilitate the discovery of suitable vaccine candidates. An overview of these methods is described in this section.",

The B cell receptor (BCR)binding site is primarily hydrophobic, consisting of six hypervariable loops of variable length and amino acid composition. B cell epitopes can be either continuous or discontinuous. Approximately 10% of B cell epitopes are contiguous, consisting of a linear stretch of amino acids along the polypeptide chain. Most B cell epitopes, though, are non-contiguous in nature, where distant residues are brought into spatial proximity by protein folding. It has been reported that not all residues within an epitope are functionally important for binding, and the specificity could be reduced or eliminated by single-site amino acid substitution.

One of the biggest challenges in this field is the lack of standards in defining B cell epitopes which has a direct impact on the selection and development of appropriate tools for analysis [33] . Current efforts are primarily focused on the design of predictors for continuous epitopes, in part, due to lower complexity in system development, and also because the experimental design of conformational epitopes is non-trivial. Propensity scales are commonly used to guide the mapping of B cell epitopes. Hopp and Woods [34] introduced the use of hydrophilicity scales for locating protein antigenic determinants. Pellequer et al. [35] applied the use of turn propensities for the analysis on 85 continuous epitopes in 14 proteins. Other amino acid propensities were also proposed, but the effectiveness of such an approach has, so far, been controversial. A benchmark on the performance of 484 amino acid propensity scales for B cell epitope prediction revealed that the best set of scales and parameters performed only slightly better than random [36] . Machine learning techniques have been applied, but also achieved limited success for predicting continuous epitopes [37] . On the contrary, structure-based predictors for B cell epitope mapping are gaining dominance, due to (1) the rapidly increasing number of three-dimensional (3D) structures of antibody-antigen complexes available in the PDB and in IMGT/ 3Dstructure-DB, and (2) the ability to predict both continuous and discontinuous epitopes. In fact, the use of structural data parallels the noticeable shift in B cell epitope prediction methodologies over the past few years, away from sequence-derived properties to much more structure-guided designs [38] .",

Tools for predicting MHC class I binding in higher vertebrates have also been reported [41] . Dynamic activities over the past 2 years have also seen at least six reports of algorithms that attempt to simulate the cell-mediated immune system by integrating the different sub-components of the antigen processing and presentation pathway such as TAP, proteasome, and MHC [42, 43] .

Standards for assessing protein allergenicity are still in their formative stages. The World Health Organization (WHO) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) proposed guidelines for evaluating allergenicity of genetically modified foods. According to the Codex alimentarius, a protein is potentially allergenic if it possesses an identity of 6 contiguous amino acids or 35% sequence similarity over an 80 amino acid window with a known allergen. Although these recommendations are in place, their inherent limitations are starting to become apparent and exceptions to the rules have been well reported [44] . Computational algorithms have been actively developed to help assess the allergenic potential of genetically modified food crops, bio-pharmaceuticals and various other products on the consumer market [45] . An example was the use of the FASTA3 algorithm with k-nearest-neighbour (kNN) classifier for assessing potential food allergenicity of newly introduced proteins [46] . The use of Fourier transform to detect compact patterns in allergens was also reported [44] . Implementation and controlled comparisons of allergen prediction systems is difficult, however, due to poorly defined standards for identifying allergenicity and the lack of experimental non-allergenic sequences. Many new allergen prediction systems use hypothetical or inferred nonallergenic sequences for system training and testing. At present, information is limited about the usefulness of much of these systems, and significant costs may be incurred in implementing, improving and managing these systems, as well as investigating false alarms. As more experimental validations are performed, the relative value of the different approaches will be known and it should be expected that the current FAO/WHO recommendations will also be refined.",

            "text": "Cancer progression is a form of somatic evolution in which certain mutations provide cancer cells with a selective growth advantage. A number of cancer genome projects are currently underway to identify novel mutations that drive tumorigenesis. An example of a targeted approach for assessing mutations and cancer risk has been reported by Kaminker et al. [54] , in which the algorithm CanPredict was used to indicate how closely a specific gene resembles known cancer-causing genes. Protein-protein interaction networks provide valuable information on tumorigenesis in humans. Hern\u00e1ndez et al. [55] has recently studied the coordinated function of cancer proteins in the human interactome. This work gives a good indication that cancer proteins are central to information exchange and propagation, and are specifically organized to promote tumorigenesis. Jonsson and Bates [56] performed a detailed analysis of cancer proteins in a human interactome constructed by computational methods, and showed that cancer proteins exhibit a network topology that is different from normal proteins in the human interactome. A number of computational models for classifying cancer subtypes based on epigenetic marks have also been reported. Specific examples include the use of SVMs for discriminating between acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia [57] , as well as the use of Manhattan distance and average linkage algorithms for hierarchical cluster analysis of human colorectal tumors [58] . Cancer epigenetics will be a major growth area in this domain, with the maturation of key initiatives such as the European Union (EU) funded CancerDip Consortium.",

The next few years will see increased interest in the use of cluster computing and distributed systems for large-scale data analysis and screening. With the explosion in the number, variety and sophistication of resources and analysis tools, the challenge is to integrate the strengths and not the weaknesses of each approach. Computational algorithms that model different aspects of the human immune system and disease have been described [42, 43] . On the other hand, cellular automata have also been proposed for exploring a wide range of virus-host relations [30] . The different bioinformatic and mathematical modeling approaches, in combination with advances in computational infrastructures, allow the construction of new models that are orders of magnitudes more complex than those currently available and facilitate a system-level understanding of the structure and dynamics of cellular and organism functions. Already, a number of 'system biology' approaches for immunological studies, such as the EU funded ImmunoGrid project [59] and the National Cancer Institute's Integrative Cancer Biology Program [60] have been reported. With the increasing availability of correlative data and maturation of key technologies for systems biology, it should be expected that many more such system-driven approaches will be developed that could lead to improved understanding of development and homeostasis of immune system processes.",
