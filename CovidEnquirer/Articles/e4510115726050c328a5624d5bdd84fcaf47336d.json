In countries where foods are produced and procured from many countries much more than the need, spoilage up to a certain level is not considered serious. However, in many countries where food production is not efficient, food spoilage can adversely affect the availability of food. With the increase in world population, serious consideration needs to be given on not only increasing food production but also reducing food spoilage, because in some countries it could reach 25% or more. The acceptance qualities of a food can be lower because of infestation with insects and rodents, undesirable physical and chemical actions, and microorganisms' growth. Microbial spoilage occurs either because of microbial growth in a food or because of the action of some microbial enzymes present in the food (Ray, 2005) .",

The first case generally contains many types of microorganisms, such as bacteria, yeasts, and molds (also viruses) from different genus, maybe more than one species from the same genus, and even more than one strain from the same species. However, when the same food is spoiled, it is found to contain predominantly one or two types, and they may not even be present initially in the highest numbers in the unspoiled or fresh product. Among the different species initially present and capable of growing in a particular food, only those with the shortest generation time under the storage conditions attain the numbers rapidly and cause spoilage.",

L. plantarum is commonly found in many fermented food products including sauerkraut, pickles, brined olives, Korean kimchi, Nigerian Ogi, sourdough, and other fermented plant material, some cheeses, fermented sausages, and stock fish. The high levels of this organism in food also make it an ideal candidate for food spoilage. Its growth rates have been found to be higher on fat than on lean beef and pork tissues (Vanderzant, Savell, Hanna, & Potluri, 1986) .",

S. thermophiles is found in fermented milk products, and is generally used in the production of yogurt and cheese. It helps make reduced-fat cheese with similar characteristics to regular, full-fat cheese. These bacteria are selected because they produce exopolysaccharide that give reduced-fat cheese a similar texture and flavor as regular cheese. In addition, S. thermophiles produced low moisture cheese and decreased the cheese bitterness (Awad, Hassan, & Muthukumarappan, 2005) .",

Due to changes in the design of industrial food processing and increasing international trade, highly thermoresistant sporeforming bacteria are an emerging problem in food production. This type of bacteria is considered a major threat in heat-treated foods. Spore-formers causing food spoilage are particularly important in low-acid foods (pH $4.6) packaged in hermetically sealed containers, which are processed by heat (Setlow & Johnson, 2007) . Certain spore-formers also cause various types of spoilage of high-acid foods (pH ,4.6), while psychrotrophic spore-formers have also been recognized to cause spoilage of refrigerated foods (Moir, 2001; Setlow & Johnson, 2007) . Both, chemical and physical treatments used in the food-processing industry are not enough to eliminate the spores (Carlin, 2011) . Endospore formers may thrive in different parts of the foodprocessing plant (Kalogridou-Vassiliadou, 1992) . A number of agents cause spore activation, including low pH, some chemicals, and sublethal heat. Although spores are metabolically dormant and can remain in this state for many years, if they receive the proper stimulus and conditions, they return to active metabolism through the spore germination (Setlow & Johnson, 2007) .",

Thermophili acidophilic spore-forming bacteria such as Alicyclobacillus can also cause spoilage of acidic beverages. They grow without the production of gas and no changes in the appearance of the beverage containers are observed. Unfortunately, this type of spoilage is discovered only when the consumer opens and begins to consume the product. The economic losses might be extremely high. Generally, bakery products are specifically spoiled by Bacillus species while different Clostridium species classically contaminate refrigerated vacuum-packed meats (Andr\u00e9, Vallaeys, & Planchon, 2016) . There are three main differences between Clostridium and Bacillus genus. The first difference, as commented earlier, is that Clostridium is strictly anaerobic, while Bacillus is an aerobic bacterium. The second difference is the spores. Clostridium forms bottle-shaped endospores, while Bacillus forms oblong endospores. The last difference is that Clostridium does not form the enzyme catalase, while Bacillus secretes catalase to destroy toxic byproducts of oxygen metabolism (Maczulak, 2011) . Microbial spoilage of food is usually indicated by changes in texture or the development of off-flavors. The primary sources of food contamination are probably soil and air. Being a soil resident Bacillus and Clostridium species are part of the microbiota of plant raw materials (used as ingredients for many foods), attached as vegetative cells or spores (Heyndrickx, 2011) . The main groups of bacteria that cause deterioration of food are described as follows.",

In addition, A. acidoterrestris is able to grow over a temperature range of 25 C to 60 C (Yamazaki, Teduka, & Shinano, 1996) . The most likely cause of contamination of the fruit is from soil contamination during harvesting. The heat resistance of the spores is such that pasteurization will not guarantee freedom from the organism (Brown, 2000) .

A marked softening of the meat without evident reduction in bulk is characteristic of C. putrefaciens (Sturges & Drake, 1927) .

Increasing in temperature reduces the time of thermal processing since at 61 C requires 2\u00c06 min, whereas 67 C demands 6\u00c017 s to reduce B. abortus counts in milk (Kronenwett, Lear, & Metzger, 1954) . Similarly, B. suis could also be destroyed by pasteurization as reported for milk heated at 62 C for at least 7 min (Park, Graham, Prucha, & Brannon, 1932) . The pH value can also influence the development of Brucella spp. since the optimal range of pH is between 6.6 and 7.4, which is close to that observed for milk (pH 5 6.6\u00c06.7). However, in pH values lower than 4.1\u00c04.5, the development of these bacteria is inhibited (Falenski et al., 2011) . However, the consumption of unpasteurized food increases the risk of brucellosis. The infection in humans mainly occurs by contact or consumption of raw or undercooked meat, unpasteurized milk, and dairy products and raw fish. The occupational exposure is the main cause of transmission in humans in farmers, slaughterhouse workers, veterinarians, and researchers (Franco, Mulder, Gilman, & Smits, 2007) . The clinical manifestations associated with brucellosis are wide: intermittent fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, night sweats, progressive deterioration in visual function, periorbital pain, and periodic generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and other impacts in hepatobiliary, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and integumentary systems. However, the information available about this disease is limited (Atluri, Xavier, de Jong, den Hartigh, & Tsolis, 2011; Franco et al., 2007; Sohn et al., 2003) .",

In food-related cases, milk was the source of infection (European Food Safety Authority, 2016). Regarding studies that evaluated Brucella spp. outbreaks, an outbreak in Nigeria in the late 1970s occurred due to the settling of nomadic populations after the local civil war. After this event, improvements were done in intend to reduce future outbreaks but the combination of pastoralist movements and growing demand for food poses the risk of Brucella outbreaks in recent days (Ducrotoy et al., 2014) . In Arab countries, the incidence of human brucellosis was reported high in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Palestinian Authority, Syria, Jordan, and Oman, where the main species was B. melitensis. In addition, the consumption of unpasteurized dairy products was associated with brucellosis in Algeria, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Palestinian Authority, and Syria (Refai, 2002) . Brucellosis is also considered as a travel disease. The occurrence of new cases in regions where this illness is under control is usually traced back to endemic regions along with consumption of contaminated nonpasteurized milk products (Norman, Monge-Maillo, Chamorro-Tojeiro, P\u00e9rez-Molina, & L\u00f3pez-V\u00e9lez, 2016) . The occurrence of new cases in areas with low or zero cases of brucellosis can also be associated with gastronomic habits of immigrants as reported for Moroccan immigrants in Spain. All nine cases in this outbreak were caused by consumption of unpasteurized raw milk (Ramos et al., 2008) .",

Although the microbiological counts of food from the day of infection were not determined due to delay onset and reporting, the most probable infected food were king prawns and chilli sauce. Cross-contamination between raw chicken liver and cooked food was suggested to explain this outbreak (Farmer, Keenan, & Vivancos, 2012) . Similarly in Barcelona (Spain), a Campylobacter outbreak was caused by poor food handling hygiene and deficient kitchen facilities. Raw chicken meat contaminated cooked food served to primary school children in canteen that means indicated cross-contamination (direct transfer of bacteria to cooked food).

Y. enterocolitica is commonly found in many farm animals (particularly pig), mammals (e.g., rodents, dogs, and cats), surface water, and sewage. This species is the main common cause of yersinosis in humans (Bottone, 1999) .",

The D-value at 50 C was reported between 17.4 and 26.3 min, while at 55 C the time was reduced to 0.65\u00c01.96 min, and at 60 C, the D-value was in the range of 0.07\u00c00.97 min (Bolton et al., 2000; Doherty et al., 1998) . In milk, D-values of Y. enterocolitica at 57.2 C (4.6\u00c014.7 min) and 62.8 C (0.18\u00c00.96 min) were dependent on the strain (Lovett, Bradshaw, & Peeler, 1982) . The control of pH value is also an important factor in the growth of Y. enterocolitica since these bacteria can develop in values between 4.5 and 8.5 (Bhaduri, Buchanan, & Phillips, 1995) . Yersinosis, particularly from Y. enterocolitica, displays diarrhea and abdominal pain as main symptoms although pseudoappendicitis (similar to appendicitis but without inflammation) may occur in older children and young adults (Rosner, Werber, H\u00f6hle, & Stark, 2013) . Yersiniosis was third most common zoonotic disease in Europe Union in 2015 with 7202 cases (average of 2.20 cases per 100.000 habitants). Y. enterocolitica was the most common species in all reported cases. Although yersinosis cases usually increase during May\u00c0August period (summer), the average rate decreased since 2008 (from 2.33 to 2.20 cases per 100.000 habitants) (European Food Safety Authority, 2016).",

The suggested cause of infection was raw food: sashimi (from fish and cattle liver), raw Tako (octopus), and semiboiled pig's ear (Lai et al., 2014 ). An outbreak in Pennsylvania, United States in 2011, was caused by consumption of glass-bottled pasteurized milk contaminated with Y. enterocolitica. A total of 22 cases were registered along with one death. The most common symptoms were diarrhea and fever although abdominal cramping, nausea, sore throat, and rash were also reported (Longenberger et al., 2014) . Similarly, in Finland an outbreak caused by contaminated raw milk affected 43 people in 2014. Microbiological assays revealed that Y. pseudotuberculosis was the pathogen and associated the contamination to single producer. The contamination occurred in the filter and after the notification; the producer recalled the milk (P\u00e4rn et al., 2015) .",

Food microbiology has undergone considerable development in recent years, largely due to predictive modeling (McMeekin et al., 2008) and risk assessment (Augustin, 2011) . In spite of that, its application in diverse areas of the food industry to improve the safe food security is still limited. According to Augustin (2011) , the microbiological risk assessment related to probabilities and severities of adverse health effects for consumers have to include four steps: (1) hazard identification, (2) exposure assessment, (3) hazard characterization, and (4) risk characterization. This risk analysis for improving food control systems is necessary to develop the different processing methodologies for the elimination of these microorganisms, such as heat treatments, chemical based on acidification or the combination of them. Besides, in the last years, emerging technologies such as plasma and advanced oxidation have been developed. However, not all of them are efficient in eliminating spores due to the morphological features that provide resistance to hostile conditions. Because of their ubiquitous nature, bacterial spore-formers are widely located in all types of foods. From the beginning of the 20th century, it has been studied the spore-forming bacteria, especially the pathogenic species, but rapidly, spoilage spore-forming bacteria were also investigated (Remize, 2016) . Indeed, in recent years, there has been an increasing interest in spore-forming bacteria, because they are considered a major risk in heat-treated food production plants. Mesophilic spore-forming bacteria belong essentially to two taxonomic groups: the Bacillales order and the Clostridium genus, depending on whether they are aerobic or not. Bacillales gathers aerobic, facultative aerobic, or facultative anaerobic bacteria. The Bacillaceae family covers 19 genera including Bacillus and Anoxybacillus, which comprise several thermophilic species, whereas inside the genus Clostridium a total of 168 species are described (Garrity & Bergey, 2009 ). The order Bacillus, Clostridium, Sporolactobacillus, Soporosarcin, and Desulfotomaculum are capable of forming endospores. For food microbiology, the first two have a special interest because of the problems caused by some species of these orders.",

It has been isolated from other species such as B. subilis, B. licheniformis, and B. pumilus that have gained great importance due to the type of pathology that they produce (Scheldeman et al., 2006) . Diarrheal disease is often associated with protein rich foods (meat, vegetables, puddings, and milk products) and is thought to be caused by vegetative cells (ingested as viable cells or spores) that produce enterotoxins in the small intestine (Abee et al., 2011) . The emetic disease is often associated with starch-rich foods (fried and cooked rice, pasta). It was identified for the first time in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s, when microorganisms from B. cereus were linked to several outbreaks caused by eating cooked rice. The B. cereus emetic toxin, cereulide, produces the emetic disease that is present in foods before ingestion (Abee et al., 2011) .",

The anaerobic status of these bacteria is a strong driver for niche differentiation compared to Bacillales representatives. Besides, they can be differentiated based on their biochemical activities, including saccharolysis and proteolysis. The first four members produce powerful toxins released from vegetating (growing) bacteria, that is, C. botulinum, produces the most powerful toxin known to man, which is the key virulence factor responsible for the pathogenesis of disease. Its action is the reverse of that of tetanus toxin, that is, it prevents muscle contraction, leading to flaccid paralysis of important muscles. It inhibits the release of acetylcholine at motor nerve endings in the parasympathetic nervous system. This potent toxin is relatively heat-resistant (although destroyed by temperatures .60 C). C. difficile is found in the feces of 3\u00c05% of humans, in the gut of several animals and in the environment. The organism produces at least two potent toxins that are responsible for severe and occasionally fatal diarrhea. C. perfringens produces a number of potent toxins, the most important of which is the a-toxin (phospholipase C), which causes host cell lysis and finally C. tetani produces an extremely potent single toxin (tetanus toxin) which underlies the pathogenesis of tetanus. Tetanus toxin consists of two components, including the neurotoxic \"tetanospasmin\" and the hemolytic tetanolysin. The toxin prevents muscle relaxation, leading to persistent contraction of facial and body muscles.",

According to several authors (Piggot & Hilbert, 2004; Sonenshein, 2000) sporulation occurs in response to a high cellular density, nutritional limitations, or cellular communication. The resistance of spores is developed during the sporulation. These spores are metabolically dormant and resistant to heat, radiation, desiccation, pH extremes, and toxic chemicals (Setlow, 2000) . The dormant spores also monitors the environment around theirs, and when conditions are again favorable (presence of germinants as nutrients such as amino acids, sugars, purine nucleosides, or other agents as lysozyme or salts) for growth, the spore germinates and goes through outgrowth, ultimately being converted back into a growing cell (Paidhungat & Setlow, 2002) . The transition from spore to vegetative cell involves three distinct phases: activation, germination, and growth. In Fig. 3 .1, schematic diagram of the sporulation and cycle of germination of the B. subtilis can be observed.",

They are composed of an internal membrane, a cortex, an external membrane, a coat, and possibly an exosporium. Each layer presents specific structural, biochemical, and permeability properties (Remize, 2016) . Exosporium is a thin delicate covering made of proteins. Inner and outer spore coats are composed of layers of spore-specific proteins. The cortex is composed of loosely linked peptidoglycan and contains dipicolinic acid, which is particular to all bacterial endospores. This acid cross links with calcium ions embedded in the spore coat and contributes to the extreme resistance capabilities of the endospores because it creates a highly impenetrable barrier. Finally, they contain the usual cell wall and, cytoplasmic membrane, nucleoid, and cytoplasm. The core only has 10%\u00c030% of the water content of vegetative cells; therefore, the core cytoplasm is in a gel state. The low water content contributes to the endospores' success in dry environments. Schematic example of spore-forming bacteria structure is depicted in Fig. 3.2 . ",

B. cereus and C. botulinum have been detected worldwide in soil samples (Dodds, 1993) with levels in soil that can reach 10 5 \u00c010 6 spores/g of soil (Lund, 1986; Te Giffel, Beumer, Slaghuis, & Rombouts, 1995) . The spores ingested with fecal and other soil materials colonize the gut of animals and may develop a symbiotic relation with their hosts (K\u00f6nig, 2006) . Besides, soil contamination can transfer to plant material (silage) and to feed. According to Magnusson, Christiansson, and Svensson (2007) , the major cause of contamination into foods is related to dispersion of spores by fecal material of warm-blooded animals. Indeed, the microorganism, C. perfringens is a common colonizer of the gastrointestinal tract of mammals (including man) (Brynestad & Granum, 2002) and C. botulinum has been identified in cow and pig feces collected in abattoirs (Dahlenborg, Borch, & R\u00e5dstr\u00f6m, 2003) . On the other hand, food-processing facilities can be also the source of spores in foods, in fact milking machinery and apparatus have been indicated as sources of milk contamination (Scheldeman, Pil, Herman, Vos, & Heyndrickx, 2005) . Specifically, Svensson, Ekelund, Ogura, and Christiansson (2004) have noticed the presence of a persistent B. cereus spore, due to their resistance to cleaning operations because many of them have strong adhering properties and ability to form biofilms (Auger et al., 2009) . Overall, it is worthy to say that processed foods are increasingly a mixture of multiple ingredients and additives, each bringing its own sporeforming bacteria into the final food products. Works in the literature clearly demonstrate that the origins of B. cereus spores are very diverse, depending on factors such as the microbial ecology, animal feeding, the farming management, the climate, and the hygienic practices during food processing.",

Physical methods of inactivation of microorganisms are those, based on the use of temperatures and modified pressures with the aim of altering cell structures or essential biomolecules for their metabolism as high-pressures (HPP) and ionizing radiations (ultraviolet and infrared). Regarding the first methodology, Zhang and Mittal (2008) reported successful conditions with HPP for the inactivation of spores of various species. However, these authors affirm that due to the complicate intrinsic and extrinsic factors, HPP conditions should be verified case by case for required sterility. It has been studied that the effect of infrared radiation on the inactivation of spores, due to this radiation is quickly converted to heat, producing an intense local heating on spores (Mamouni, Tang, Wu, Vlahovic, & Yang, 2011) . Explanation is based on local heating over the spores produce mechanical abrasion causing the germination by the activation of the lysis enzymes (Dong, Tang, Wu, Vlahovic, & Yang, 2013) . These enzymes are present in the spore in an active form, but they do not act until they are activated by the mechanical damage.",

Spores are extremely resistant to a variety of chemicals, including acids, bases, oxidant and alkylating agents, aldehydes and organic solvents. However, treatments with strong acids can eliminate spores, probably due to the rupture of the inner membrane (Setlow, 2006) . On the contrary, treatment with a strong alkali is less effective because they can be reactivated with an adequate recovery by lysozymes (Setlow, 2006) . Within emerging technologies, we can highlight plasma and advanced process of oxidation based on radical generation. Plasma has been reported to inactivate both vegetative cells and bacterial endospores. Three basic mechanisms have been attributed to the inactivation of spores: (1) DNA degradation by UV radiation, (2) volatilization of compounds of the spore surface by UV photons, and (3) erosion of the spore surface by the adsorption of reactive molecules as free radicals (Philip et al., 2002) .",

In addition, the pigments in the mycelium (black, purple red, gray, etc.) are also characteristic. Molds are characterized by the development of hyphae (a mass of branching, interwined filaments), which result in the colony characteristics (known as a mycelium). In general, most molds require less available moisture than required for most yeast and bacteria and the optimal temperature for most molds range from 25 C to 30 C. In addition, molds grow on the surface of food (they require free oxygen for growth) and in a wide range of pH values (from 2 to 8.5), but the majority is favored by an acid pH.

They can be transmitted in different ways but the infection of the cells lining the intestinal tract and dispersed by shedding into the stool or through emesis were the most important foodborne infections. Several different viruses may cause a single disease, as determined by the tissue or organ that is affected, or one virus may cause a unique disease due to the nature of its interaction with the body (Rosenthal, 2009) . Numerous viruses can be found in the human gut, but only few are commonly recognized as important foodborne pathogens. According to the type of illness that they produce, viruses can be classified into three groups (Koopmans & Duizer, 2004) : G Viruses that causes gastroenteritis G Enterically transmitted hepatitis viruses G Viruses that cause illness after they migrate to other organs, such as the central nervous system or the liver.",

Symptoms of foodborne parasitic infections vary greatly depending on the type of parasite. Helminthic infections can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, muscle pain, cough, skin lesions, malnutrition, weight loss, neurological, and many other symptoms depending on the particular organism and burden of infection.

People acquire trichinosis by consuming raw or undercooked meat infected with the Trichinella parasite, particularly wild game meat or pork. Even tasting very small amounts of undercooked meat during preparation or cooking puts you at risk for infection. Several different species of Trichinella can cause human disease; the most common species is Trichinella spiralis, which has a global distribution and is the species most commonly found in pigs. However, there is an increasing number of reports of Trichinella britovi as a cause of human infection caused by meat from domestic pigs (Gamble, Zarlenga, & Kim, 2007; Pozio, Rosa, & Morales, 2001) . Trichinosis is considered a zoonosis because infection occurs after ingestion of raw or poorly cooked meat from infected animals. One to two days after the ingestion of heavily encysted meat, trichinae penetrates the intestinal mucosa, producing nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea and sometimes, vomiting. The larvae begin to invade striated muscles about 7\u00c09 days after the initial symptoms. About 6 weeks after the initial infection, encystment occurs, accompanied by tissue pain, swelling, and fever (Jay et al., 2005) .",

This roundworm infection is caused by two closely related genera and species: Anisakis simplex and Pseudoterranova decipiens. Both of these organisms have several intermediate hosts and generally more than one definitive host (Jay et al., 2005) . The transmission of this disease occurs when infective larvae are ingested from fish or squid that humans eat raw or undercooked (Sakanari et al., 1988) . The noninvasive form of anisakiasis is generally asymptomatic, resulting in tingling throat syndrome when worms are released from seafood following digestion and migrate up the esophagus into the pharynx, where they subsequently may be expectorated (Sakanari & McKerrow, 1989) . In the invasive form, worms typically penetrate the mucosa of the stomach or small intestine, resulting in epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, usually 12 h after consumption of the infected seafood (Hayunga, 2007) . In some chronic cases, the only treatment is the removal of the larvae via endoscopy or surgery.",

The parasite is protected by an outer shell that allows it to survive outside the body for long periods and makes it very tolerant to chlorine disinfection. While this parasite can be spread in several different ways (as food contaminated with Cryptosporidium oocytes), water (drinking water and recreational water) is the most common way to spread the parasite. Generally, C. parvum infects the border of the intestinal epithelium and causes villous atrophy. Immunocompetent patients develop a profuse diarrhea accompanied by epigastric cramping, nausea, and anorexia (Ortega, 2007) .",

Infections are acquired principally by ingestion of food and water containing oocysts, ingestion of animal tissues containing cystic forms or transplacental transmission (Dubey & Beattie, 1988) . The unsporulated oocysts require 24 h outside the host to differentiate and become infectious. When the oocysts are ingested, the sporozoites are released and they invade epithelial cells and rapidly multiply asexually, producing tachyzoites. Choriorentinitis is frequently observed in adults who acquire the infection. Other symptoms as fever with rash, headache, muscle aches, and pain and swelling of the lymph nodes were described (Jay et al., 2005) . In immunosuppressed patients, toxoplasmosis could be reactivated from latent infections (Reiter-Owona et al., 2000) . Toxoplasmosis can also be acquired by transplacental transmission when a pregnant woman becomes infected. Most infected children do not show any signs of the disease until later in life, when they may present with choriorentinitis and mental retardation (Ades, 1991; Brady-McCreery, Hussein, & Paysse, 2003; De Marco, Ceccarelli, Frulio, Palmero, & Vittone, 2003) .",

Most human infections result from the ingestion of contaminated water or food or direct fecal-oral transmission. Giardia is protected by an outer shell that allows it to survive outside the body for long periods. Five different species of Giardia have been described (G. muris, G. lambia, G. agilis, G. ardeae, and G. psittaci) (Erlandsen & Bemrick, 1987; Ortega, 2007) . Giardia can be observed in the form of trophozoite and the cyst. The cyst is the infectious form and is relatively inert. After cysts are ingested, excystation occurs in duodenum after exposure to the acidic gastric pH and the pancreatic enzymes. The majority of Giardia infections are asymptomatic, but they can present a chronic diarrhea. Symptomatic patients present with loose, foul-smelling stools, and increased levels of fat and mucus in fecal samples. Flatulence, abdominal cramps, bloating, nausea, anorexia, and weight loss are common. Fever is occasionally present at the beginning of the infection (Ortega, 2007) .",
