However, live attenuated vaccines often elicit reduced immune responses and protection against heterologous variant strains because commercially available vaccines are unable to confer a wider spectrum of protection against these viruses. Vaccination using two heterologous attenuated vaccine strains has been recommended to circumvent this limitation and can provide a wider spectrum of protection against some field variant IBV strains [11] . However, it is still difficult to determine the combinations of attenuated heterologous viruses that may confer a more effective protection against variant IBV strains [1, 11] . Additionally, live attenuated IBV vaccine strains can be involved in the emergence of more pathogenic recombinant IBV variants [1] .",

In fact, -IBV antibodies of IgG and IgA isotypes as well as T cell (TCD8)-mediated immune responses, particularly at mucosal sites,  have been consistently associated with effective protection against IBV infection elicited by previous infection or by vaccination  with live attenuated IBV vaccines [7-9, 17, 18, 21, 27]. However, antibody and TCD8 memory immune responses induced by  combining live heterologous and inactivated homologous vaccines against variant nephropathogenic IBV strains as well as the  correlation of these immune responses for conferring effective protection induced by the vaccination regime against this IBV pathotype remain to be better characterized. Nevertheless, it has been reported that inactivated vaccines when used without priming with live attenuated vaccines induce poor systemic immune responses and no effective protection against tracheal ciliostasis, renal lesions, and loss in egg production caused by virulent IBV strains [1, 4, 26] . In Brazil, since the last decade, despite the frequent use of Massachusetts IBV vaccines, a high number of variant IBV isolates have emerged; these strains have been phylogenetically classified by S1 gene sequencing under a separate genotype of Brazilian strains (BR-I genotype) [5, 12, 13, 16, 19, 24, 36] . In addition, some BR-I IBV strains have been characterized as nephropathogenic strains after experimental infection of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens [12, 14, 15] . Recently, protectotype analysis of some nephropathogenic BR-I IBV strains demonstrated that Massachusetts live attenuated vaccines conferred only partial protection to tracheal and kidney tissues [12, 14] , although the combination of Massachusetts and 793B live attenuated vaccines improved protection against these BR-I nephropathogenic strains [12] . Additionally, virus neutralization tests (VNT) showed that some BR-I genotype strains do not belong to the Massachusetts serotype [5, 34] .",

Forward and reverse primer sets for the quantification of relative expression by qPCR of the three genes were designed to anneal to specific exons of the genes in a manner that only mRNA would serve as the template for amplification during real-time qPCR (Table 1 ) [29] . Another primer set specific for a region of S1 gene (forward-5\u2032-CACGTGATGTTGGTAACACCTCTTTT-3\u2032 and reverse 5\u2032-CCGCGGAGAACGTCTAAAACGACG-3\u2032) of IBV [27] was used to quantify the viral load in tracheal and renal tissue samples collected from all experimental groups.

The relative expression of CMI responses genes in tracheal and renal samples of vaccinated or non-vaccinated and infected chickens was measured as fold-change relative to the non-vaccinated and non-infected group (negative control group), and the gene expression from each tissue sample was standardized using the Cq value of GAPDH for the same tissue sample [27] .",

We hypothesized that the significant differences in the expression of Granzyme homolog A gene could be ascribed to the increased expression of this gene by effector cytotoxic effector T cells (CTLs), which are present in higher numbers in IBV-infected tissues of the Vac. Group. However, we also assumed that immature TCD8 cells were strongly recruited to the IBV-infected tissues of both the Vac. and Non-vac. Groups, in which these T cells proliferated, thereby increasing the expression of CD8\u03b2 gene but not that of Granzyme homolog A.

Conversely, it can be speculated that Granzyme homolog A is also produced by natural killer (NK) cells, but in our study, the kinetic profile of Granzyme homolog A gene expression in the Vac. Group was associated with the expression of CD8\u03b2 gene, which is an exclusive marker of CTLs [23, 28, 29] . Interestingly, CTLs are associated with the clearance of virus-infected cells and effective protection against another nephropathogenic IBV (Gray strain) in na\u00efve chickens receiving adoptive transference of memory TCD8 cells [9] .",

Additionally, the antibody and CMI memory responses induced by this vaccination protocol are relevantly associated with the protection status of chickens vaccinated and challenged with a nephropathogenic IBV strain, highlighting the importance of these immune responses to confer protection against this pathotype of IBV and stressing the potential of combining heterologous live attenuated vaccines with homologous inactivated vaccines for efficiently controlling infection caused by nephropathogenic variant IBV strains, such as those of BR-I genotype.",
