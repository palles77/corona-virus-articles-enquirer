            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in southern China in late 2002 and caused a global outbreak with a fatality rate around 10% in 2003. Ten years later, a second highly pathogenic human CoV, MERS-CoV, emerged in the Middle East and has spread to other countries in Europe, North Africa, North America and Asia. As of November 2017, MERS-CoV had infected at least 2102 people with a fatality rate of about 35% globally, and hence there is an urgent need to identify antiviral drugs that are active against MERS-CoV. Here we show that a clinically available alcohol-aversive drug, disulfiram, can inhibit the papain-like proteases (PL pro s) of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Our findings suggest that disulfiram acts as an allosteric inhibitor of MERS-CoV PL pro but as a competitive (or mixed) inhibitor of SARS-CoV PL pro . The phenomenon of slow-binding inhibition and the irrecoverability of enzyme activity after removing unbound disulfiram indicate covalent inactivation of SARS-CoV PL pro by disulfiram, while synergistic inhibition of MERS-CoV PL pro by disulfiram and 6-thioguanine or mycophenolic acid implies the potential for combination treatments using these three clinically available drugs.",

Ten years later, when SARS had almost been forgotten, a second highly pathogenic human CoV, MERS, caused the severe respiratory syndrome in the Middle East and then spreading to other countries due to human activity (Zaki et al., 2012) . MERS-CoV has infected at least 2100 people with a high mortality rate of 35% since 2012 (http://www.who.int/csr/ don/7-november-2017-mers-saudi-arabia/en/). Because of international travel and climate change, we cannot rule out the possibility of the emergence of additional highly pathogenic CoVs in the near future (Menachery et al., 2015 (Menachery et al., , 2016 . Thus, the development of antiviral drugs effective against CoVs is urgently needed.",

PL pro is responsible for the cleavage of non-structural proteins (nsp) 1, 2 and 3 while M pro cleaves all junctions downstream of nsp4 (Perlman and Netland, 2009 ). In addition, PL pro can deubiquitinate or deISGylate host cell proteins, including interferon factor 3 (IRF3), and inactivate the pathway of nuclear factor \u03ba-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB), resulting in the immune suppression of host cells (Clementz et al., 2010; Frieman et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2014; Zheng et al., 2008) .

It is known to irreversibly inhibit hepatic aldehyde dehydrogenase (Lipsky et al., 2001) . Recent studies indicate T that disulfiram is able to inhibit other enzymes, such as methyltransferase, urease and kinase, all by reacting with important cysteine residues, suggesting broad-spectrum characteristics (Diaz-Sanchez et al., 2016; Galkin et al., 2014; Paranjpe et al., 2014) . In addition, there has been a clinical trial investigating the usage of disulfiram for reactivating latent HIV in order to make it accessible to highly active anti-retroviral therapy (Elliott et al., 2015) , and the drug has also been shown to act as a \"zinc ejector\" with respect to hepatitis C virus NS5A protein (Lee et al., 2016) . However, the effect of disulfiram on viral cysteine proteases is still unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that disulfiram is an inhibitor of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV PL pro s, and furthermore that disulfiram acts on MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV PL pro via different inhibition mechanisms. Moreover, we investigated the synergies between a number of known PL pro inhibitors and disulfiram, and our results point to the possibility of using combination treatments involving disulfiram and other clinically available drugs against CoVs.",

The target protein was purified from the fraction of soluble proteins via nickel affinity chromatography, then loaded onto an S-100 gel-filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with running buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol). For the crystallization of SARS-CoV PL pro in complex with glycerol, the reductant was removed and 50 \u03bcM disulfiram was added to each buffer during the purification process. The purity of the fractions collected was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the protein was concentrated to 30 mg/ml using an Amicon Ultra-4 30-kDa centrifugal filter (Millipore).",

The inhibition of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV PL pro s by disulfiram PL pro s are cysteine proteases that use the thiol group of cysteine as a nucleophile to attack the carbonyl group of the scissile peptide bond Han et al., 2005; Verma et al., 2016) . Inhibition can be expected if the catalytic cysteine of a PL pro is interfered with or modified (Cheng et al., 2015; Chou et al., 2008) . Disulfiram is known to be a thiol-reactive compound that can covalently modify cysteine residues (Diaz-Sanchez et al., 2016; Galkin et al., 2014; Lipsky et al., 2001; Paranjpe et al., 2014) . To determine whether disulfiram can inhibit coronaviral PL pro s, the DUB activity of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV PL pro was measured in the presence of various concentrations of disulfiram. Interestingly, disulfiram showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on both proteases with IC 50 values in the micromolar range ( Fig. 1) . Next, to elucidate the kinetic mechanisms of the interactions between disulfiram and the two PL pro s, the proteolytic activity of each enzyme was measured in the presence of various concentrations of a peptidyl substrate and disulfiram. The results were then fitted to different kinetic models (competitive, noncompetitive, uncompetitive and mixed inhibition). Surprisingly, disulfiram showed a noncompetitive inhibition pattern against MERS-CoV PL pro ( Fig. 2A ) but a competitive inhibition pattern against SARS-CoV PL pro (Fig. 2B ). This inconsistency is quite intriguing since the two enzymes share a similar overall structure and an identical catalytic triad (Bailey-Elkin et al., 2014; Chou et al., 2014; Lei et al., 2014; Ratia et al., 2006) , albeit the inhibition constant (K is ) of disulfiram for MERS-CoV PL pro is 4.4-fold higher than that for SARS-CoV PL pro (Table 1 ). Perhaps this discovery should not be surprising given that disulfiram is also a noncompetitive inhibitor for Citrullus vulgaris urease with a K is of 67.6 \u03bcM (Diaz-Sanchez et al., 2016), while its IC 50 for Giardia lamblia carbamate kinase is 0.6-1.4 \u03bcM (Chen et al., 2012) . Similarly, a previous study mentions that their compound 4 also has different recognition specificity for the two PL pro s . Our study once again suggests broad-spectrum potency for disulfiram, given the versatility it shows even against two coronaviral PL pro s.",

            "text": "The inconsistent inhibitory effect of disulfiram against the two PL pro s suggests that the binding modes of disulfiram on the two enzymes may be different. To verify this, multiple inhibition assays using disulfiram and other known PL pro inhibitors, including 6TG, MPA and NEM, were performed (Fig. 3) (Chen et al., 2009; Cheng et al., 2015; Yonetani and Theorell, 1964) . Interestingly but not surprisingly, we found that disulfiram displays a synergistically inhibitory effect with either 6TG or MPA on MERS-CoV PL pro , with the lines in the Yonetani-Theorell plots intersecting above the x-axis and \u03b1 values below 1 in both cases (Fig. 3A and B) (Copeland, 2000) . In contrast, in the case of SARS-CoV PL pro , each of the plots displays two parallel lines and both \u03b1 values are significantly higher than 1 (Fig. 3C and D) , suggesting that binding of disulfiram and of 6TG or NEM are mutually exclusive on SARS-CoV PL pro (Copeland, 2000) . Since 6TG is a competitive inhibitor of both PL pro s (Cheng et al., 2015; Chou et al., 2008) , the contrasting synergy of disulfiram and 6TG on the two PL pro s confirms the inconsistent inhibitory pattern of disulfiram (Figs. 2 and 3) . Furthermore, MPA has previously been shown to be a noncompetitive inhibitor of MERS-CoV PL pro and to work synergistically with 6TG to inhibit MERS-CoV PL pro (Cheng et al., 2015) . Combining those results with our results regarding the binding synergy of disulfiram and 6TG or MPA (Fig. 3A and B), we propose that disulfiram may occupy a third binding site on MERS-CoV PL pro , neither a site at the active center nor the MPA binding site. Next, we evaluated PL pro inhibition in the presence of disulfiram combined with 6TG and/or MPA by proteolytic assays using a peptidyl substrate. We found that the IC 50 of disulfiram against MERS-CoV PL pro showed a 1.6-fold decrease in the presence of 15 \u03bcM 6TG and a 5.2-fold decrease at 15 \u03bcM 6TG when it was tested in combination with 150 \u03bcM MPA (Table 2) . For comparison, in the case of disulfiram against SARS-CoV PL pro , there is no enhanced inhibitory effect in the presence of 6TG or NEM. Our results suggest a potential for using the above three FDAapproved drugs in combination treatments against MERS-CoV. Incidentally, previous studies have suggested that MPA may be used in combination treatments with interferon against MERS-CoV (Chan et al., 2013) . The experiments were repeated to ensure reproducibility. Kinetic parameters such as K M , k cat and K is from the best-fit results are shown in Table 1 . In the presence of disulfiram, the best-fitted kinetic parameters and K is were determined in accordance with competitive (Eq. (3)) or mixed inhibition (Eq. (4)) and noncompetitive (Eq. (2)) inhibition models for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV PL pro , respectively. c The value is \u03b1K is , the inhibition constant for the enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex. d K inact and k max values are from the best fit to the saturation equation (Eq. (7)).",

            "text": "Previous studies suggested that disulfiram can bind to the zincbound cysteines in hepatitis C virus NS5A protein (Lee et al., 2016) . As there are four cysteines bound to a zinc ion in PL pro s ( Fig. S2C and S2D ) (Bailey-Elkin et al., 2014; Chou et al., 2014) , we performed zinc ejection assays to test whether these zinc-bound cysteines may be a candidate for the aforementioned \"third binding site\" occupied by disulfiram on MERS-CoV PL pro . In the present study, the zinc-specific fluorophore, FluoZin-3, was used to identify the release of zinc ion due to the binding of disulfiram to the enzyme (Fig. 4A) . Unexpectedly, we observed significant zinc release in the presence of disulfiram not only from MERS-CoV PL pro but also from SARS-CoV PL pro . This result indicates that disulfiram may bind not only to the active site but also to the zinc-binding sites in SARS-CoV PL pro . Following this finding, we tried to fit our inhibitory results to a mixed inhibition model (Fig. S1 ). The two K is for the enzyme-substrate and enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complexes were 6.0 and 43.8 \u03bcM, respectively, showing a 7.3-fold difference in the binding affinity for the two putative binding sites (Table 1 ). This significant difference may explain why the inhibitory pattern of disulfiram against SARS-CoV PL pro looks more like competitive inhibition. Next, the thermostability of the two PL pro s in the absence and presence of disulfiram was evaluated (Fig. 4B) . Not surprisingly, the melting temperature of both PL pro s decreased 10-15\u00b0C in the presence of disulfiram. These results conform to our earlier finding that the release of zinc ion can destabilize PL pro (Chou et al., 2012) . 6)). (C) The observed inactivation rate constants (k inact ) from panel B were replotted against disulfiram concentration. The solid line is the best-fit result in accordance with the saturation equation (Eq. (7)). Kinetic parameters K inact and k max corresponding to the best-fit curve are shown in Table 1 .",

            "text": "Disulfiram is known to covalently modify cysteine residues and leave a diethyldithiolcarbamate (DDC) moiety to inactivate the carbamate kinase of Giardia lamblia (Galkin et al., 2014) . In the presence of 5 mM \u03b2ME, however, the inhibitory effect of disulfiram against PL pro s is minor and the IC 50 is larger than 300 \u03bcM (Table 2 ). This suggests that the reductant can protect the enzyme and, therefore, that disulfiram may inhibit the enzyme by modifying the cysteine in the catalytic triad (Cys112-His273-Asp287). To further investigate this possibility, the DUB activity of the enzyme was measured after incubation with 200 \u03bcM disulfiram for 1 h followed by removal of the small molecules using a Sephadex G-25 column. This treatment resulted in an 84% loss of activity, suggesting irreversible inhibition of SARS-CoV PL pro by disulfiram (Fig. 5A, right panel) . Similarly, in a previous in vivo study, disulfiram-treated aldehyde dehydrogenase showed 77% enzyme inhibition as compared to the activity of the control (Lipsky et al., 2001) . Next, the disulfiram-treated SARS-CoV PL pro was incubated with 5 mM \u03b2ME for 10 min, after which activity was measured to test for re-activation. We found that 30% of the enzyme's activity was restored after treatment with \u03b2ME (Fig. 5A, right panel) . The rescuing effect of the reductant suggests that the modification was due to the disulfide bonding interaction between the enzyme and the inhibitor. However, in the case of MERS-CoV PL pro , we found that treatment with disulfiram resulted in an irreversible loss of activity which was not rescued by the addition of the reductant (Fig. 5A, left panel) . Previous studies have suggested that the release of zinc ion following treatment with EDTA will lead to a 62% loss of PL pro activity (Chou et al., 2012) . This result is consistent with the effect of disulfiram on PL pro s. Also, the inability of the reductant to rescue the DUB activity of MERS-CoV PL pro , suggesting that disulfiram cannot influence its active site, is compatible with disulfiram's noncompetitive mode of inhibition of the enzyme.",

By fitting the data to Eq. (6), different k inact values at various concentrations of disulfiram were determined and then plotted versus those disulfiram concentrations (Fig. 5C ). The saturated curvature suggests a slowbinding phenomenon due to covalent inactivation (Copeland, 2000) , a conclusion supported by the irrecoverability of enzyme activity after disulfiram removed (Fig. 5A) . Best-fit analysis determined a K inact of 5.4 \u03bcM and a k max of 0.011 s \u22121 (Fig. 5C and Table 1 ). Interestingly, the K inact value is close to K is , indicating that disulfiram may inactivate the enzyme very soon after binding. For comparison, previous studies have indicated that 6-mercaptopurine and 6TG are also slow-binding inhibitors against the same enzyme, albeit enzyme activity was recovered after removing the inhibitors (Chou et al., 2008) .",

            "text": "The structure of SARS-CoV PL pro in complex with disulfiram should allow us to understand the binding mechanism more clearly. Accordingly, we attempted to crystallize SARS-CoV PL pro in the presence of disulfiram. Unfortunately, although crystals of the protein were formed in the presence of 0.4 mM disulfiram, the crystal structure showed only \u03b2ME-like electron density near the active-site cysteine with no omit electron density shown near the zinc-binding site ( Fig.  S2A and S2C ). \u03b2ME is a reducing agent that is added into the purification buffer to stabilize the protein, and which is also known to reverse the effect of disulfiram (Table 2, Fig. 5A and Kitson, 1975) . To avoid this effect, we eliminated all reducing agents from the purification process, added 50 \u03bcM disulfiram into all purification buffers, and then attempted to crystallize the protein purified under these conditions. Although we were able to grow crystals under different crystallization conditions, we again obtained an unexpected result, as the only omit electron density near the catalytic site was fitted as a glycerol molecule ( Fig. S2B and S2D ). This result might be due to the crystals having been cryoprotected in reservoir solution supplemented with 25% (v/v) glycerol. Nevertheless, the binding of \u03b2ME and glycerol near the active site suggests that the active site may be accessible to disulfiram. Next, using the aforementioned two complex structures, a disulfiram and a DDC molecule were docked into the glycerol and \u03b2ME binding sites, respectively (Fig. 6) . DDC may be able to covalently bind to residue Cys112 in a manner similar to that of \u03b2ME (Fig. 6A ), while disulfiram may be able to occupy the glycerol site (Fig. 6B) . Interestingly, in the docking structure of the PL pro -disulfiram complex, we can see that one sulfur atom of the disulfide bond of disulfiram is within 4 \u00c5 of residue Cys271 at blocking loop 2 (BL2), which is very important for substrate and inhibitor binding Ratia et al., 2008) . For comparison, there is a valine at the same site in MERS-CoV PL pro (Bailey-Elkin et al., 2014; Chou et al., 2014) . To verify the possible inhibitory effect of disulfiram due to binding to residue Cys271, inhibition of the SARS-CoV PL pro C271A mutant by disulfiram was measured (Fig. S3) . Interestingly, we can see a 4.4-fold increase in IC 50 ( Table 2 ) compared with that for inhibition of wild-type SARS-CoV PL pro by disulfiram. In addition, the decrease of the melting temperature of the C271A mutant following treatment with disulfiram is 6\u00b0C, lower than that of wild-type SARS-CoV PL pro treatment with the same inhibitor ( Fig. 4B and C) . These findings suggest that disulfiram may inhibit SARS-CoV PL pro partly via the residue Cys271 and support the reliability of the docking of disulfiram on the glycerol binding site. Based on our kinetic and structural results, we propose kinetic mechanism schemes for the inhibition of the two PL pro s by disulfiram (Fig. 7) . Similar to the mechanism in the case of disulfiram-treated urease (Diaz-Sanchez et al., 2016) , disulfiram may form a covalent adduct with SARS-CoV PL pro and then leave a DDC on the active-site Cys112, preventing downstream acylation and thereby inactivating the Fig. 6 .

The red dashed lines show putative polar interactions while the black dashed line shows the distance between residue Cys271 and disulfiram as 4.0 \u00c5.

In contrast, disulfiram shows a noncompetitive inhibitory effect against MERS-CoV PL pro and can synergistically inhibit that enzyme with 6TG and MPA.",
