This process of adaptation might have been pivotal in the switch from aborted outbreaks to the international pandemic of SARS-CoV in 2003-04. 14 We report detailed clinical and virological information for two related cases of MERS-CoV disease, after nosocomial transmission of the virus from one patient to another in a French hospital in April, 2013.",

            "text": "Patient 2 was admitted on April 26, at a time when pneumonia was already present in patient 1 and MERS-CoV was present in the bronchoalveolar lavage sample taken on the same day (although this result was not available at the time). For the next 3 days, the two patients shared the same room with no specifi c isolation measures other than standard precautions. 9-12 days after this exposure, patient 2 developed symptoms suggestive of lower respiratory tract infection (fi gure 3). In patient 2, infection with MERS-CoV was confi rmed 2 days later on an induced sputum sample. This timeframe is at the high end of the 1-9 day incubation period reported in the two secondary cases from the UK 10 and of the 2-10 day incubation period of SARS. 23 In view of the very small number of patients for whom a well-defi ned window of exposure for MERS-CoV is available, this fi nding of human-to-human transmission through exposure during the upper range of reported incubation periods suggests that incubation periods beyond 10 days might be possible with MERS-CoV, with important implications for the duration of the quarantine needed to rule out infection in contacts. Furthermore, patient 2 had not recently travelled abroad, excluding any other source of contamination. However, the exact route of transmission from patient 1 to patient 2 remains unclear. Nosocomial transmission of MERS-CoV has been suspected in patients and health-care workers with respiratory symptoms in Jordan in April, 2012, and in an ongoing hospital outbreak with more than 20 cases in Saudi Arabia. 24 Person-to-person transmission was further documented from one patient to two family members in the UK 10 and for two cases reported in Tunisia. 8 As for SARS-CoV, transmission through large respiratory droplets is currently thought to be the most likely route of MERS-CoV transmission between the two patients we describe. No aerosol-generating procedures were used with patient 1. The presence of diarrhoea in 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 patient 1, possibly linked to MERS-CoV infection as previously described with SARS-CoV, 25 might also have been a potential source of contamination of the environment. Systematic detection of MERS-CoV in stools of future patients might be important to document shedding of the virus through faeces and its potential contribution to viral transmission. During the hospital stay in Valenciennes, no personal protective equipment was used, and we did not record any secondary trans mission in more than 100 health-care workers assessed for the development of symptoms or tested by RT-PCR for the presence of MERS-CoV (unpublished). Similarly, patient 2 was discharged from the hospital to his home and, up to now, no secondary cases have been detected in some 40 contacts. Low virus shedding in the upper respiratory tract might contribute to reduced transmis sibility, although serological investigations will be needed to better assess the extent of transmission. The under lying disorder and immuno suppressive treatment of the two patients probably contributed to their increased susceptibility to the infection, and such background should be added to the list of criteria associated with increased suspicion of MERS-CoV infection. The risk that on acquisition of mutations MERS-CoV might become increasingly transmissible between human beings must also be kept in mind and continuously assessed as suggested. 26 Contributors BG, AF, and SvdW jointly wrote the report. BG, JP, LeM, CS, NE, XL, FV, and DM were involved in the treatment of patients 1 and 2 and the clinical management of their contacts. AG, SB, VE, VC, JCM, and SvdW were involved in the laboratory testing and interpretation of results from specimens. VE and SvdW did the analysis of the viral sequences. AM and DC were involved in the epidemiological investigation. All other contributors of the MERS-CoV study team participated in the treatment of patients 1 and 2, the clinical management of their contacts, the epidemiological investigation, and virological analyses. All coauthors provided comments and approved the fi nal version of the report. ",
