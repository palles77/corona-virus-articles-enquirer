Much attention is rightfully given to emerging diseases of commercial food animals; however, small animal practitioners also have an obligation to be vigilant to the possibility that new and devastating viral diseases might emerge that infect the companion animals in their charge. Canine parvovirus (CPV) type 2, emerged in 1978 and spread worldwide within less than 2 years [1] . In 2001, a new antigenic type, CPV-2c, was reported in Italy [2] , which has since caused outbreaks in Western Europe, Asia, South America, and the United States [3] because current vaccines offer no protection for this type. In this article, the authors are specifically concerned with the timely and accurate detection of emerging diseases of small animals that are viral in origin. The term emerging virus is defined broadly and includes these categories:",

Emerging viral infections may take a heavy toll on the health of cats or dogs whenever they are brought into situations in which groups of animals are housed together, even temporarily, such as at greyhound racetracks, kennels, catteries, animal shelters, animal obedience training classes, dog parks, pet stores, pet day care facilities. This is especially true when pets are allowed by their owners to roam at will, commingling with ownerless feral dogs and cats and wildlife. For example, the rapid spread of CPV-2, which is extremely stable in the environment and highly contagious, was caused not only by the movement of dogs by their owners but by the transfer of fecal material on shoes and clothing of travelers and, unintentionally, through national and international mail [1] . According to the 2007 to 2008 National Pet Owners Survey conducted by the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association, the US pet cat population is estimated to be 88.3 million and the pet dog population is estimated to be 74.8 million [4] . Municipalities throughout the United States commonly pass animal control ordinances to protect the public health and safety and general welfare of the citizens and animals residing within the city. Typically, animal control codes limit the numbers of companion animals that individuals may own or keep on their private property, require that cats and dogs be licensed annually by owners and vaccinated against rabies, prevent animals from running at large, require proper disposal of animal waste, and prevent the feeding of wild or feral cats or dogs. Vaccination of dogs and cats by compliant pet owners for rabies prevention has, since 1960, dramatically reduced the occurrence of this disease; currently, most animal cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now occur in wildlife [5] . Compliance with other animal control ordinances is variable, particularly among pet owners with respect to leash laws for dogs and cats and among well-intentioned individuals who maintain wild or feral colonies of cats and dogs by providing food, water, and shelter. Statistics from the Humane Society of the United States indicate that 6 to 8 million companion animals are admitted to shelters each year and nearly half are adopted or reclaimed by their owners, whereas the remaining animals are euthanized [6] . No census of ownerless dogs and cats is available. Estimates of the feral cat population in the United States range from 60 million to 100 million animals living primarily in or near urban settings with ample opportunity to interact with pets that are allowed to roam and with wildlife [7] . Thus, ownerless, wild, or feral dog and cat populations may transmit infectious and zoonotic diseases between wildlife and companion animals. From a public health standpoint, this is of particular importance because emerging viral infections from wildlife are often transmitted to human beings by means of a pet that is allowed to stray.",

            "text": "It is widely believed by virologists and public health epidemiologists that most viruses emerging from wildlife have an RNA or single-strand DNA genome [8] because they have a high propensity for mutation. Two significant canine viruses have emerged recently and meet this hypothesis: CPV and canine distemper virus (CDV). Canine distemper has re-emerged in the past decade [9, 10] because of antigenic and genetic drift in the surface protein (H glycoprotein). In a multicontinent study, variant CDV strains, (but not the vaccine strain of CDV virus) were the cause of illness within 2 weeks after vaccination. In 2005 and 2006, large outbreaks of CPV variants (CPV-2c and CPV-2b*) in kennels occurred in Oklahoma and other states [10] . Diagnostic and molecular studies detected mutations in the parvovirus isolates that explained the failures of current commercial CPV vaccines from conferring protection and of approved commercial diagnostic kits from detecting these new viral isolates. Another recent example is outbreaks of hemorrhagic symptoms associated with virulent feline calicivirus (FCV) in the United States [11] ; however, molecular basis of gain of virulence in FCV is not yet understood. In addition to virus evolution, in some cases, the virus can be reintroduced back after the population immunity has declined after a period of disease-free status. Thus, diseases that have been eradicated from developed countries but are still circulating in developing countries [12] may re-emerge by reintroduction from trade or movement of animals.",

The primary mission of the CDC is to promote and protect human health. To this end, the CDC performs surveillance for noninfectious and infectious diseases, including zoonoses [14] ; however, the only chosen reportable viral diseases of animals that are collected by the CDC are rabies and avian influenza (H5N1), and those that are reported to the CDC ArboNET system are avian, animal, or mosquito WNV infections. Largely, surveillance of companion animal diseases, many of which have zoonotic potential, has not been considered to be a priority until recently [15, 16] . In 2004, the CDC partnered with the Purdue University School of Veterinary Medicine to establish a pilot surveillance system to monitor clinical syndromes and diseases of small animals [17] to determine whether animals can serve as sentinels of health hazards to human beings. The National Companion Animal Surveillance Program (NCASP) initially drew exclusively on the database of the privately owned organization, Banfield, the Pet Hospital, which provides medical care to approximately 1.6 million pet dogs and cats in 44 states, and it now integrates data from Antech Diagnostics to detect potential emerging and zoonotic infections. A long-term goal of the NCASP is to become a national resource in veterinary public health. In the meantime, the front line of companion animal surveillance for emerging diseases is at the home front, with astute small animal clinicians playing a major role.",

Linking to a health-related network for companion animals might fill the gap. Recently, a space-time permutation scan statistic, which was applied in the anthrax terrorist attacks in 2001 [18] , WNV outbreaks [19] , and enzootic raccoon rabies [20] , has been applied to veterinary diagnostic data in the Unite States and Europe [21] . This analysis provides important information about potential clusters of medical conditions and issues medical alerts about the developing situations based on mortality and confirmed diagnosis of important disease conditions. Earlier and more timely notifications should lead to more thorough investigations and reduce losses, especially from emerging viral diseases. It is important to keep in mind that clinical syndromes tend to be multifactorial, and it is essential to review the entire history, including environmental factors, with the specialist in a small animal specialty practice and also with a small animal teaching hospital before arriving at a conclusion about the case.",

Detecting emerging viral diseases of companion animals requires interaction and discussion among clinicians, pathologists, and virologists, and practicing small animal veterinarians must stay engaged in communication with these specialists through their state diagnostic laboratories or nearby colleges of veterinary medicine. Veterinary diagnostic medicine is rapidly progressing, and it is critical for the successful practitioner to stay abreast of new developments in small animal infectious diseases and their diagnosis through continuing education [22] [23] [24] . The development of monoclonal antibody technology in the 1980s and the advent of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in the 1990s have reshaped veterinary diagnostic strategies, especially in the subspecialty of virology. Now, these molecular techniques, which are becoming mainstream applications in routine viral diagnoses, are proving their merit in facilitating the diagnosis of emerging animal viruses. The authors offer practical information on the applications of diagnostic techniques for investigating viral disease outbreaks in companion animals. The authors provide this brief overview of diagnostic techniques in the modern virology laboratory that are used for routine diagnosis and in identifying novel and emerging viruses. Every step of diagnostic investigation-history, specimen collection, transportation, and laboratory examination-has to be carefully aligned for optimal outcome.",

In some cases, there may be a history of vaccination compliance, yet some animals develop disease [25, 26] . It is important to record the complete history, including the body system involved (eg, respiratory, gastrointestinal, reproductive tract, nervous system), clinical symptoms and their duration, the presence of lesions, and vaccination history. Particularly when the case is confounding, the client must be carefully and thoroughly interviewed as to how he or she manages the pet (ie, is the pet free to roam; has the pet traveled recently and where; if this is a new pet, where and how was it obtained; are there other pets in the household). Consulting a book on differential diagnoses can be useful to list the potential causes [27, 28] . When a history of unusual symptoms is presented, clinicians, recognizing that these cases may be important to individual and universal animal health, should refer these cases to an accredited veterinary diagnostic laboratory. It is convenient to attach copies of all relevant hospital records to the laboratory submission form to aid the diagnostician. Correct diagnosis depends on a thorough case history of the affected animal and submission of appropriate specimens that are collected and transported in a manner to preserve the integrity of the viral agent.",

All the system(s) that are potentially involved and all the tissues with gross lesions should be sent to the diagnostic laboratory. It is important to check for concurrent infections. Viral diagnosis depends on the quality and type of specimen collected [29] . The best time for collection of specimens is immediately after symptoms of disease are first noticed. Samples from all body systems involved in the acute stage of the disease of affected animals should be submitted to the diagnostic laboratory in a timely manner by overnight delivery. At least 1 to 5 g or mL of each sample should be collected. Recovery of virus in cell culture depends on the condition of the specimen received by the diagnostic laboratory. Freezing specimens can be detrimental to virus isolation efforts (and also to electron microscopic identification) and should only be done (\u00c070 C) if it is not possible to deliver the specimen to the laboratory within 48 hours. Use wet ice for shipping virology samples, because dry ice (solid carbon dioxide gas) can inactivate many viruses, preventing isolation in cell culture. Tissues intended for virus isolation should always be shipped in separate packages from specimens that are immersed in formalin to prevent fumes of formaldehyde from reaching the fresh tissues.",

Tissue tropism, mononuclear infiltrates, development of inclusion bodies (intranuclear, cytoplasmic, or both), and the formation of syncytia are some of the characteristics that differ among viruses and can sometimes distinguish different viral infections. For example, most DNA viruses replicate in the nucleus, and thus tend to produce intranuclear inclusions, whereas most RNA viruses form cytoplasmic inclusions, although there are exceptions. As part of the pathologist's examination, immunohistochemistry testing (Figs. 4 and 5), fluorescent antibody testing, and possibly in situ hybridization (ISH) studies on tissues may be ordered; these methods are considered elsewhere in this article. A complete histopathology report should include possible differentials for the lesions. The pathologist might note that some findings do not exactly fit the routine lesions he or she has observed in previously. In cases in which there are deviations in lesion type or distribution or when gross lesions and histopathologic findings suggest the involvement of a viral disease but routine virology tests do not detect the expected conventional viral agents, variant or ''emerging'' viruses or even iatrogenic infections may be suspected. In early 1990, blue tongue virus serotype 11 was introduced in canine populations from a commercial modified-live multivalent canine vaccine that was associated with high mortality in dogs [31, 32] . In some situations, second or even third opinions from pathologists at other laboratories who have special expertise should be solicited [33] . With the application of telepathology to veterinary case materials, networks of specialists, including veterinary pathologists, small animal clinicians, infectious disease specialists, and laboratory diagnosticians, are able to exchange patient histories, clinical data, and images (gross and microscopic) through the Internet for consultation, diagnosis, and education. This allows timely access to expert opinions at other locations throughout the world [34, 35] . The use of telepathology can facilitate rapid intervention through the synergy of computer technology and special pathology expertise (eg, system-and speciesspecific pathologic findings) to understand the lesions in difficult cases better.",

In many of the recent emerging viruses from wildlife (eg, bats), the virus was first cultivated, allowing further characterization of the virus. It is important to keep in mind that virus isolation, even if the effort is successful, may have a slow turn-around time, approximately 2 to 3 weeks. Definitive identification of virus in cell culture can only be accomplished with specific antibody nucleic acid testing, and in the case of an ''emerging'' virus, existing reagents may not be reactive with the ''new'' virus.

Serologic tests are now used to detect antibody or antigen in serum and body fluids. Typically, methods used in the virology laboratory are serum neutralization (SN), hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) test, indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT), and ELISA. Serologic results require interpretation by an expert diagnostician based on critical clinical observations, confirmation by pathology examination, virus isolation, and mass screening of the populations by serology. If animals in populations that have never been exposed to or vaccinated against a given virus have specific antibodies detected in their serum, it is expected that this is most likely attributable to recent exposure to the emerging virus. Paired serum samples are important to demonstrate a fourfold significant increase in antibody titers, which indicates that the diagnosis of recent exposure may be attributable to infection as opposed to previous exposure or vaccination depending on the vaccination history.

The SN test can diagnose current infection using acute and convalescent serum samples from individual animals. It may also be used to determine immune status conferred on vaccinated animals.

Usually, vaccination titers are lower relative to infection titers, and maximal titers occur approximately 21 to 30 days after vaccination.

The ELISA format is flexible, and it may be used to detect antibody or antigen in clinical specimens. In either case, the detection system is an antibody conjugated to an enzyme. When the enzyme-linked antibody binds to the analyte being measured, the enzyme reacts with a chromogenic substrate, causing a color change to occur that may be measured spectrophotometrically or evaluated visually. Several ELISA kits are available to detect antiviral antibodies in companion animals, including CPV and CDV, feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and feline coronavirus. The immunoglobulin M (IgM) ELISA is a method used to distinguish current infection from past infection. During acute disease or immediately after vaccination with modified-live viruses, IgM is the first class of immunoglobulin produced in response to infection, appearing 1 to 2 weeks before there are detectable levels of IgG in the serum. Because it is short-lived, IgM levels typically disappear 3 months after infection. A single acute-phase serum test sample is sufficient to diagnose current infection with an IgM ELISA. Testing of IgM titers is available for several viral agents, including CDV and CPV among others. ELISA is useful for screening naive animal populations for the presence of antibodies against viruses to track the origin and spread of emerging infections. Antibodies to WNV have recently been detected in dogs and cats by IgM-capture ELISA [42] .

To perform the assay, purified virus is disrupted using detergent; the constituent proteins are then separated on the basis of molecular weight by electrophoresis in a polyacrylamide gel. The proteins are transferred (blotted) from the gel to a nitrocellulose or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane for stabilization. The electrophoretically separated proteins are the antigen substrates for analyzing the test sera for the presence of specific antibodies. As with the ELISA format, the Western immunoblot uses an enzyme-labeled antispecies antibody that binds to the test serum antibodies that have bound to the separated viral antigens. Substrate reacting with the enzyme-labeled antibody in the presence of a colorless soluble benzidine derivative results in conversion to colored insoluble precipitate at the protein bands where test serum antibodies are bound. The molecular weight of the protein detected is characteristic for a particular viral component. Immunoblot results of the unknown test antisera are compared with positive control test sera for interpretation. A major advantage of the immunoblot technique is that a full antibody profile of a single serum sample is made simultaneously, identifying each of the individual particulate viral antigens that patient antibodies bind. As an epidemiologic tool, WB analysis may be used to detect currently circulating viral subtypes within a population and to characterize new emerging viral subtypes. Immunoblotting is also a valuable research technique for antigen detection that is often used to characterize novel viruses by comparing them with known related viral family members using standard antisera or monoclonal antibodies.",

There is a trend toward application of molecular or gene sequence-based techniques to routine virology testing in diagnostic laboratories, which is justified under several circumstances. First, a molecular technique may be the test of choice if conventional methods of diagnosis are technically weak, such as when a viral agent is noncultivable or there are biocontainment concerns with culturing the virus, the virus has amorphous morphology by EM, antibodies are unavailable or not specific to the virus, and serologic tests result in a confounding diagnosis. Second, molecular techniques may be essential to detect and classify the sequence type or genotype of a virus. Third, a viral agent may be characteristically slow to replicate, such as c-herpes virus; thus, a molecular method might provide a better turn-around time for diagnosis. In this instance, a rapid diagnosis might be achieved by pan-herpesvirus PCR. Finally, a novel viral isolate that cannot be definitively identified by the routine diagnostic methods described previously may merit investigation and characterization by molecular-based techniques, which are indispensable in the classification of new and emerging viruses. These advanced techniques may confirm a diagnosis of viral etiology when other tests have failed; however, they are, unfortunately, relatively expensive. Furthermore, the presence of nucleic acid does not equate to infection, and infections are attributable to subclinical, latency-associated nucleic acids or defective interfering virus particles, such as in paramyxoviruses, produced in nonproductive infections in genetically resistant hosts. Clients, who bear the financial burden, should be counseled as to the benefit and shortfalls of this testing before ordering molecular-based tests. An excellent review of molecular-based techniques for diagnostic testing of infectious diseases has appeared in a previous issue in this series [46] .",

Although this variation on PCR and nucleic acid sequencing is currently used exclusively as a research tool, it is likely to be adapted for clinical diagnostic work in future years because it has been demonstrated to detect many different unrelated viruses simultaneously in a single reaction and to identify viral serotypes and detect viral isolates that could not previously be typed by classic procedures [52, 53] .",

Moreover, the PCR protocols targeting structural genes that are expressed only during active infection are useful and avoid the potential false-positive results attributable to latency or persistent viral infections. Moreover, the sense and antisense probes offer the opportunity for resident and replication intermediates of viruses.

Because of changes in the sequence of the target protein epitopes, antibodybased detection methods may fail to provide the diagnosis; monoclonal antibodies used may fail to react and polyclonal antibodies may cross-react weakly when a variant strain of virus is present. Thus, a sudden trend in lack of correlation between tests may signal an emerging variant of the virus. If a new variant of the virus arises, it may be associated with a change in the clinical profile and we may or may not understand the molecular basis of this shift. It is possible that the polyclonal antibodies may react weakly with the new variant of the virus. In many cases, the PCR primers may fail to amplify the new variant if the mutation occurs in the hypervariable region of the target gene amplified. For example, in the recent emergence of CPV variants, many practitioners noted clinical symptoms compatible with CPV but the commercial field tests were not working. If a new variant of virus emerges, a polyclonal antibody antiserum prepared in a heterologous species (rabbit or goat) can be used as a primary antibody against the whole virus, because it is possible that the monoclonal antibody might fail. The molecular techniques are more likely to fail compared with the antibody-based techniques because of the degeneracy of codons. It is important to keep in mind that factors other than emerging viruses can also affect the performance of USDA-approved tests. For example, local anesthetic can also affect the outcome of antibody tests. In one study, the use of lidocaine was recommended over oxybuprocaine to avoid false-positive results [59] .",
