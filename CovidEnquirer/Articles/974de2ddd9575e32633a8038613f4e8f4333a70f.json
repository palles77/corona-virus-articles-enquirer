As chloroquine, an antimalarial agent, has shown some antiviral effects, this study evaluated its effect in patients with dengue. A randomised, double-blind study was performed by administering chloroquine or placebo for three days to 129 patients with dengue-related symptoms. Of these patients, 37 were confirmed as having dengue and completed the study; in total, 19 dengue patients received chloroquine and 18 received placebo. There was no significant difference in the duration of the disease or the degree and days of fever. However, 12 patients (63%) with confirmed dengue reported a substantial decrease in pain intensity and a great improvement in their ability to perform daily activities (p = 0.0004) while on the medication and the symptoms returned immediately after these patients stopped taking the medication. The same effect was not observed in patients with diseases other than dengue. Therefore, this study shows that patients with dengue treated with chloroquine had an improvement in their quality of life and were able to resume their daily activities. However, as chloroquine did not alter the duration of the disease or the intensity and days of fever, further studies are necessary to confirm the clinical effects and to assess the side effects of chloroquine in dengue patients.",

Of the 129 patients, 63 were randomised to receive chloroquine and 66 were ran-domised to receive placebo. Seventy-five patients had other febrile diseases (OFDs) and 54 were confirmed to have dengue. Of the dengue patients, 17 refused to participate and 37 completed the study. Of these patients, 19 received chloroquine (mean age, 32.72 \u00b1 11.50 years; male, 42%; duration of symptoms, 1.94 \u00b1 0.90 day) and 18 patients received placebo (mean age, 36.74 \u00b1 11.83 years; male, 56%; duration of symptoms, 1.56 \u00b1 0.73 day). No patient exhibited the severe form of the disease (dengue haemorrhagic fever) and/or shock (dengue shock syndrome) (Table) . There was no significant difference between group characteristics (p > 0.05) and the most frequent symptoms were fever (100%), body ache (99.2%), headache (96.8%), joint pain (70.4%) and retro-orbital pain (68%). There was no significant difference in the duration of the disease or the intensity and days of fever among the dengue patients treated with either chloroquine or placebo. However, 12 (63%) of the dengue patients reported a substantial reduction in the intensity of pain and a great improvement in their ability to perform daily chores after taking chloroquine, whereas no improvement was reported by the patients taking placebo (p = 0.0004) (Table) . However, as this finding was not observed in the patients with OFDs, which included bacterial pneumonia, urinary tract infection and influenza, these diseases were not included in the statistical evaluation because the primary goal of this study was to examine the influence of chloroquine on the evolution of dengue disease. Interestingly, the symptoms returned immediately after the patients stopped taking the three-day chloroquine treatment, showing that chloroquine's effect was most likely due to the anti-inflammatory action of chloroquine rather than to its antiviral effect.",

The rationales for using chloroquine in dengue patients include the drug's anti-inflammatory property, possible antiviral effect, with action on flaviviruses, low cost, universal availability and safety and global public health importance of dengue. Recently, a potential use of chloroquine has been described in some viral infections, such as influenza, human immunodeficiency virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (coronavirus) (Lanciotti et al. 1992 , Savarino et al. 2003 , Vincent et al. 2005 , Adachi et al. 2007 , Di Trani et al. 2007 , Keyaerts et al. 2009 , Martinson et al. 2010 .",

            "text": "One possible explanation for the antiviral effect of chloroquine could be related to the impairment of viral replication by raising the intracellular pH and thereby interfering with endosome-mediated viral entry. An increase in pH in acidic organelles, including endosomes, lysosomes and Golgi vesicles, leads to unwanted changes in the post-translational modifications of newly synthesised proteins, particularly the inhibition of glycosylation (Savarino et al. 2004 , Rolain et al. 2007 ). These effects are of particular importance in DENV infection because these viruses require endosomal acidification to release their viral RNA in the cytoplasm to initiate viral replication (Lindenbach & Rice 2003) . Other possible antiviral actions of chloroquine are based on either interference with the post-translational processing of viral glycoproteins, leading to imperfect glycosylation or to undefined interference with the late stages of viral replication (Savarino et al. 2003 (Savarino et al. , 2004 . However, the exact mechanism of action of chloroquine has not been completely elucidated and differs depending on different pathogens (Rolain et al. 2007 ). Tricou et al. (2010) evaluated the effect of chloroquine in hospitalised adult patients with dengue and found no difference in viraemia or NS1 antigenaemia duration and modest anti-pyretic activity for chloroquine in the intention-to-treat population, but not in dengue laboratory-confirmed cases. Moreover, these researchers observed a trend toward a lower incidence of dengue haemorrhagic fever in dengue patients treated with chloroquine.",

Chloroquine may worsen psoriasis, though is rarely associated with seizures and psychosis. Acute toxicity is most frequently found with therapeutic or high doses administered too rapidly by parenteral routes (AlKadi 2007) . Toxic effects are related to the ingested dose and a single dose of 20 mg/kg is considered toxic (Taylor & White 2004) . In this study, a safety dose of 600 mg per day for three days was used in adults and the side effects were unremarkable. Furthermore, the chloroquine dosage used in this study is very similar to the dosage used for vivax malaria treat-ment and, in our experience, side effects are rare with this treatment.
