Human infection with one of these novel highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) viruses was first recognized during the 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong S.A.R. of China. Since 2003, outbreaks of HPAI A(H5N1) have occurred among poultry in Asia, Europe and Africa, and human infections with this subtype are continuing [1] . The consequences have worsened with 382 infected human cases and 241 deaths as of April, 2008 [2] . Millions of avian species have been lost by culling, imposing a huge economical burden on developing countries. The ongoing circulation of avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses in poultry in areas of Asia and Africa and the continued human infection with this subtype emphasize the need to enforce a diagnostic protocol for rapid and sensitive detection of the infections. Several methods have been used for A(H5N1) diagnosis in reference laboratories including PCR, RT-PCR and real-time PCR, especially a conventional RT-PCR method using specific primers as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) [3] .",

            "text": "Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a novel nucleic acid amplification method reported by Notomi et al. in 2000 [4, 5] with the advantage of being simple, rapid and easy to perform especially in the field setting where there is a lack of sophisticated diagnostic equipment. LAMP has been successfully applied in the detection of viruses like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus, Rift Valley Fever Virus, West Nile Virus and Dengue Virus [1, 6, 7, 8] . Reverse transcriptase (RT)-LAMP has been used for A(H5 N1) avian influenza virus identification with some initial success [9, 10, 11] . However, the sensitivity of LAMP, which uses six primers recognizing eight distinct regions on the target gene, is not stable due to the rapid changes of A (H5N1) influenza virus genotypes. Updating the primer sequences is necessary to maintain the high sensitivity of the H5 RT-LAMP assay. In this study, we designed a new set of RT-LAMP primers for H5 hemagglutinin (HA) gene identification with a specificity and sensitivity higher than previously reported RT-LAMP primer sets. In addition, our primers may be applicable for all the clades and subclades of A(H5N1) influenza viruses based on the lower number of mismatches to the reference sequences. Experimental results with nine A(H5N1) virus strains of both clade 1 and 2 (subclade 2.3) and the clinical samples collected in 2007 in Vietnam showed high specificity and sensitivity. Our new RT-LAMP primers are considered to be a useful method for HPAI virus infection diagnosis and surveillance.",

Some with unclear results were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. The data showed identical positive results between RT-LAMP and RT-PCR in 16 of 41 samples. Twenty four samples gave negative results by both methods. Only one sample, which was negative with RT-LAMP, gave an unclear positive (+/-) result with RT-PCR, but was confirmed as positive by real-time RT-PCR (Table 3 ). All the positive samples by RT-LAMP showed the ladder-like pattern in electrophoresis analysis. Furthermore, we have tested 30 recently collected human and avian samples, which are the suspected and confirmed cases of A(H5N1) in Northern Vietnam between late 2007 and March 2008 (data not shown). 100% of the positive cases with RT-PCR had been detected by RT-LAMP and there was no false positive result. Notably, the positive samples whose detection time was around 20 minutes could be propagated in cell culture.",

However, human cases transmitted by close contact with infected poultry have been reported continuously. An early and rapid method for diagnosis of A(H5N1) human suspected cases has an important role in the surveillance of the disease. LAMP has been shown to be a useful nucleic acid amplification method for clinical diagnosis and surveillance of dis-eases due to its simple operation, rapid reaction and easy detection. An RT-LAMP assay is a simple diagnosis tool in which the reaction is carried out in a single tube by mixing the buffer, primers, reverse transcriptase, and DNA polymerase and incubating the mixture at 62.5 C for 60 minutes in a regular laboratory water bath or heat block. specificity to those strains compared to RT-PCR and viral isolation. The evolution analysis of updated A(H5N1) viruses has characterized Vietnam's strains belonging to subclade 2.3.4 [13] , and the sequence alignment of these strains shows that the target region for our RT-LAMP is still well conserved. Thus we predict that our primers will work well on new A(H5N1) viruses from Vietnam.",

These data (with clade 1 and 2.3 of H5 viruses) and the alignment showing the very limited number of mismatches with clade 2.1 and 2.2 (Table 4) suggest that our LAMP primers can be used widely and effectively with all circulating A(H5N1) viruses. The detection limits of H5 RT-LAMP vary from 1 PFU to 10 -3 PFU for each virus strain(Table 2). Although PFU titer indicates a functional measurement rather than a quantitive method, higher detection limits of 0.1 or 1 PFU were obtained, and almost all of the viruses were 2007 isolates, which have re-emerged since November 2005. Two strains that showed lower sensitivity by our RT-LAMP method also belonged to that group. This suggests that the genotypes of circulating A(H5N1) influenza viruses have changed and that the sensitivity of the RT-LAMP method was reduced even though the assay has been updated this time. Analysis of genetic changes in A(H5N1) viruses and continuous upgrading of the primers may be needed in the near future. Current examinations on human and avian clinical samples in Northern Vietnam from late 2007 until March 2008 showed that our RT-LAMP primers had high sensitivity and",
