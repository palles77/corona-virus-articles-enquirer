Using the helminth-derived adjuvant, IgG isotype responses to OVA were of a mixed Th1/Th2 profile and spleen cell cytokines exclusively Th1-type. The potent adjuvanticity of rOv-ASP-1 was confirmed in mice vaccinated with a 37-mer peptide from the S protein of SARS-CoV and an HIV-1 gp120-CD4 chimeric polypeptide antigen.

They use a large armoury of immunoregulatory molecules to subvert the protective immune responses of the host and minimize severe pathology [1, 2] . Some of these helminth-derived modulators of human immune responses have great potential as new therapeutics. For example, ES-62, a secreted glycoprotein product of the rodent filarial nematode Acanthocheilonema viteae, has broadly antiinflammatory properties that inhibit Th1 cytokine production in experimentally induced arthritis in mice [3] . ES-62 is currently being developed as a novel anti-inflammatory therapeutic [4] . In another nematode, body fluid from the pig roundworm, Ascaris suum, contained potent activity that stimulated IL-10, which is characteristic of Th2 and regulatory T cells. The parasite products reduced the inflammation caused by experimentally induced delayed type hypersensitivity in mice [5] .",

While conducting experiments designed to evaluate recombinant Onchocerca volvulus ASP-1 (rOv-ASP-1) as a possible vaccine candidate against onchocerciasis in humans, we vaccinated mice with the recombinant protein alone or with alum or Freund's adjuvants and measured IgG1 and IgG2a isotypes that are broadly associated with Th2 and Th1 T cell responses, respectively. rOv-ASP-1 stimulated both IgG1 and IgG2a antibody responses to the protein itself, with a slight Th1 dominance [11] . Since these effects occurred in vaccinated mice in the absence of adjuvant, we asked the question whether the protein could act as an adjuvant to assist unrelated proteins in inducing antibody responses.

Inclusion bodies containing insoluble rOv-ASP-1 were treated with 6 M urea at 4 \u2022 C overnight, and the urea-soluble rOv-ASP-1 was then further purified by preparative SDS-PAGE on a PrepCell (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The protein-containing fractions were eluted in Laemmli buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.3) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing the purified rOv-ASP-1 were identified by INDIA TM HisProbe-HRP (Pierce, Rockford, IL) chemiluminescent Western blotting, and protein concentrations were determined using detergent-compatible protein assay reagents (Bio-Rad). Although the rOv-ASP-1 protein at working dilutions tested negative for bacterial endotoxin using a Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), we sent a sample for quantitative LPS testing following FDA guidelines to Cambrex Bio Science (Baltimore, MD). Testing revealed that there was a residue of 0.44 Endotoxin Units (EU)/g rOv-ASP-1 protein. At a dose of 25 g/mouse, therefore, the animals would receive 11 EU per injection which is well below the FDA accepted limit of 50 EU/mL for biologicals. However, to definitively exclude any possibility of residual LPS in rOv-ASP-1 contributing to any adjuvant effects, we batch-treated the concentrated stock solution (2.5 mg/mL) of rOv-ASP-1 three times with LPS-removing gel (Detoxigel TM system, Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL), and adjusted the protein concentration accordingly. Repeat testing by Cambrex showed no detectable LPS in the treated rOv-ASP-1 preparation and a single batch was used throughout the experiments presented here.",

The peptide derived from the spike (S) protein of SARSassociated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), designated CP-1 [12] , was synthesized by a standard solid-phase FMOC method in the Microchemistry Laboratory of the New York Blood Center. CP-1 spans amino acids 1153-1189 of the heptad repeat 2 (HR2) region of the SARS-CoV S protein, which plays an important role in fusion between the virus and target cell membranes [12] . The FLSC polypeptide is a chimera of the full-length HIV-1 BaL gp120 and the first and second extracellular domains (D1D2) of soluble CD4 joined by a 20-amino acid linker. This polypeptide faithfully duplicates the structural, functional and antigenic properties of the native gp120-CD4 complex intermediate that arises during HIV replication and enables binding to CCR5 on target cells [13] . FLSC inhibited binding of HIV-1 in vitro to target cells expressing CCR5 [13] . Therefore, the antibodies directed against FLSC may block HIV-1 binding to CCR5. A plasmid expressing the FLSC protein was kindly provided by Dr. A. Pinter at the Public Health Research Institute with the permission from Dr. A.L. DeVico at the University of Maryland. A stable cell line expressing recombinant FLSC was established by transfecting the plasmid into 293T cells using FuGene 6 (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacture's protocol. Soluble FLSC was purified from cell culture medium by lectin chromatography with Galanthus nivalis snowdrop agglutinin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) as described [14] .",

MPL + TDM (equivalent to RIBI TM adjuvant) is composed of equal amounts of monophosphoryl lipid A (detoxified endotoxin) from S. Minnesota (MPL) and synthetic trehalose dicorynomycolate (TDM) in 2% oil (squalene)-Tween 80-water. Per immunization, each animal received 50 g of antigen (OVA, SC-1 or FLSC) in 0.1 mL sterile, LPS-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) mixed with one of the commercial adjuvants following the manufacturer's instructions, or with rOv-ASP-1 (25 g/0.1 mL PBS). Each of the antigen/adjuvant mixtures or adjuvants (as controls) was injected into a group of five mice subcutaneously in the nape of the neck. Mice received one boost (for OVA) or two boosts (for CP-1 and FLSC) 14 days post-immunization. All experiments were performed twice or more and representative data are shown.",

In recent preliminary studies using OVAimmunized C57BL/6 mice which favour Th1 responses [16] , rOv-ASP-1 adjuvant was associated with a Th1-dominated (IgG2a) antibody response to OVA but also with considerable IgG1 titres (IgG1:IgG2a = 0.5). The antibody response to OVA in Balb/c mice was Th2-skewed (IgG1) but, as in the data presented here, there was also a significant IgG2a component (IgG1:IgG2a = 3.0). Thus, the rOv-ASP-1 adjuvant augments both Th2 and Th1 antibody responses in mice with the overall balance dependent on the genetic background of the immunized animal. We have used a range of doses of rOv-ASP-1 adjuvant; 2.5 g/mouse was not significantly active for antibody responses and 10 g/mouse gave adjuvanticity intermediate to the final dose that we chose (25 g/mouse).

The early human response to first exposure to live L3 of Brugia malayi, another filarial nematode, has recently been shown to be Th1dominated. Numbers of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells expressing IFN-\u2425, TNF-\u2423 and GM-CSF were increased on exposure to L3 in vitro but not T cells expressing Th2 cytokines [17] . It is possible that L3-secreted ASPs are involved in the stimulation of the Th1 cytokines.

The mechanism responsible for the adjuvanticity of rOv-ASP-1 is not yet clear, however, from our studies using human PBMC we know that the protein binds to a subpopulation of monocytes.

In a separate study, mice immunized with purified FLSC, all developed high antibody titres for the immunogen, but none of the sera possessed neutralizing activities against HIV virus in vitro [18] . The authors suggested that a major portion of the antibody response against the FLSC protein may be directed against immunodominant conformational epitopes unique to the fusion polypeptide that do not mediate viral neutralization. In the present study, serum from FLSC + adjuvant-immunized mice also recognized HIV-1 gp120 protein in ELISA. The mean total IgG anti-gp120 titre obtained with rOv-ASP-1 was 1,250,000 and with MPL + TDM adjuvant, 670,000 (data not shown). Titres to gp120 were lower than to FLSC since all of the gp120 epitopes may not be accessible in the FLSC fusion polypeptide. For safety and regulatory reasons, we are not currently able to assess neutralizing activity to SARS-CoV.",

Unusually for a helminth protein, the antibody and cellular responses induced had a strong Th1 component. Depending on the immunogen, adjuvanting with rOv-ASP-1 resulted in a Th2-type (IgG1)-dominant antibody response that lacked IgE. This immunostimulatory helminth protein may have utility as a human therapeutic.",
