A classic analysis was done by Boyer (1982) to determine the reasons for crop losses over a four-decade period in the United States. He found that drought causes 40.8% of crop losses and excess water causes 16.4%. Insects and diseases amount to 7.2% of the losses. Thus, soils that are too dry or too wet are the major reasons for lost productivity.",

Hammond and Kirkham (1949) plotted the common logarithm of dry weight versus time and found that soybeans have three growth stages, I, II, and III. The analysis showed that the plants produce dry matter at the greatest relative rate during period I; at a smaller rate during period II; and at a still smaller rate during period III. That is, the slopes declined with age (slope \u00bc r/2.303). They saw that the dates of change in the growth curves from period I to period II were also the dates when the plants began to bloom. The dates of the second change in the growth curve, or the change from period II to period III, were the dates when the plants reached maximum height. The soybeans grew on two different soils, Clarion loam and Webster silt loam. The soybean plants in the Clarion soil bloomed and reached maximum height about a week earlier than the soybeans on the Webster silt loam soil. The growth curves clearly showed this difference (Figure 1.3) . Growth curves, therefore, can be used to see the effect of the soil environment on plant growth. Hammond and Kirkham (1949) did not give a reason for the difference in rate of growth on the Webster and Clarion soils, but it probably was related to one of the four soil physical factors that affect plant growth: water, temperature, aeration, or mechanical impedance. For corn, they found four periods of growth (Figure 1.4) . The additional period in corn apparently was related to the difference in time of appearance of male and female flowers in corn. The physiological changes associated with the breaks in the curves were connected with tasseling, silking, and cessation of vegetative growth. The last break occurred after the corn plants had reached maximum height. In sum, the data for soybeans and corn showed that a quantitative analysis FIGURE 1.3 Logarithmic dry matter accumulation curves of soybeans grown in the field in Iowa on Webster and Clarion soils.

            "text": "John Napier (1550e1617), a distinguished Scottish mathematician, was the inventor of logarithms. The son of Scottish nobility, Napier's life was spent amid bitter religious dissensions. He was a passionate Protestant. His great work, A Plaine Discouery of the Whole Reuelation of Saint John (1594), has a prominent place in Scottish ecclesiastical history as the earliest Scottish work on the interpretation of the scriptures. He then occupied himself by inventing instruments of war, including two kinds of burning mirrors, a piece of artillery, and a metal chariot from which a shot could be discharged through small holes. Napier devoted most of his leisure to the study of mathematics, particularly to developing methods of facilitating computation. His name is associated with his greatest method, logarithms. His contributions to this mathematical invention are FIGURE 1.4 Logarithmic dry matter accumulation curves of Iowa 939 corn in 1938 and 1939 . From Hammond and Kirkham (1949 .

Reprinted by permission of the American Society of Agronomy. contained in two treatises: Mirifici logarithmorum canonis descriptio (1614; translated into English in 1857) and Mirifici logarithmorum canonis constructio, which was published two years after his death (1619) and translated into English in 1889. Although Napier's invention of logarithms overshadows all his other mathematical work, he has other mathematical contributions to his credit. In 1617, he published his Rabdologiae, seu numerationis per virgulas libri duo (English translation, 1667). In this work, he describes ingenious methods of performing the fundamental operations of multiplication and division with small rods (Napier's bones). He also made important contributions to spherical trigonometry (Scott, 1971 ).",
