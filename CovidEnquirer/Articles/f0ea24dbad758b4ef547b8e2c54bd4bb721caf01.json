Evidence also exists that viruses can protect against autoimmune disease. Several proposed mechanisms explain the viral effects. One mechanism is ''molecular mimicry'' which represents a shared immunologic epitope with a microbe and the host. We consider, using a simple mathematical model, whether and how a viral infection with molecular mimicry can be beneficial or detrimental for autoimmune disease. Furthermore, we consider the possibility of development of a vector therapeutic vaccine that can relieve autoimmune disease symptoms. Our findings demonstrate that vaccine therapy success necessitates (i) appropriate immune response function, (ii) appropriate affinities with self and non-self antigen, and (iii) a replicative vector vaccine. Moreover, the model shows that the viral infection can cause autoimmune relapses.",

His experiments led him to conclude that the immune system is normally focused on responding to foreign materials; it has an inherent tendency to avoid attacking self tissues. Nevertheless, when this process goes wrong, the immune system can attack self tissues, resulting in autoimmune disease (Bell and Bird, 2005) . Autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis (MS), can create life-long disability and increased mortality.",

            "text": "Even in 2008, we do not completely understand the primary initiators or causes of many of these autoimmune diseases. No single theory or mechanism can adequately explain all features or pathogeneses of autoimmune diseases. The clinically wide spectrum of autoimmune diseases is best considered as the mosaic of autoimmunity. The many factors involved are genetic, hormonal, immunological, and environmental (Deodhar, 1992) . In particular, virus infections have long been associated with autoimmune diseases, whether MS, diabetes, or myocarditis (Fujinami, 2004; Fujinami et al., 2006; Horwitz and Sarvetnick, 1999; von Herrath and Oldstone, 1996) . Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain virus triggers of autoimmune diseases. One mechanism is ''molecular mimicry'' (Fujinami, 2001; Fujinami et al., 2006; Libbey and Fujinami, 2002) , which represents a shared immunologic epitope with a microbe and the host. For example, molecular mimicry has been assigned a presumptive role in the pathogenesis of several human diseases, including insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus type-1 (IDDM), ankylosing spondylitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, primary biliary cirrhosis, and MS (Fujinami, 2001; Horwitz and Sarvetnick, 1999; Janewa et al., 2004) . The immune response to the virus cross-reacts with self because of molecular mimicry, which engenders autoimmunity as follows (Fujinami et al., 2006) ; virus-infected-antigen presenting cells (APCs) present viral peptides in the contexts of MHC class I and II, respectively, to naive CD8 \u00fe T cells and CD4 \u00fe T cells. Activation of T cells engenders IFN-g production, which further activates APCs, leading to production of IL-12, a potent Tcell-differentiating cytokine. Effector CD4 \u00fe T cells release proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN-g and IL-2, thereby stimulating T cells to differentiate into effector T cells. Activated T cells can also secrete IFN-g and TNF, which can engender macrophage activation. The activated macrophages in turn release TNF, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen intermediates, which can kill infected cells and uninfected cells. Dead and dying cells are then phagocytosed by macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), which can present self antigens to autoreactive CD4 \u00fe T cells. Similarly, effector CD8 \u00fe T cells can kill infected cells via perforin and granzyme granules. Cell debris is taken up by APCs, which can present self antigens to autoreactive CD8 \u00fe T cells. The generation of such cells can engender autoimmune responses with enhanced inflammation if not modulated by regulatory T cells releasing IL-10 and/or TGF-g. Consequently, patients can develop autoimmune disease through virus-induced autoimmunity.",

Possible mechanisms of protecting against autoimmune disease are considered as ''altered peptide ligand'', which activates regulatory cells that modulate the disease (Barnett et al., 1996; Fujinami et al., 2006) , and ''activationinduced cell death'' (AICD) which engenders anergy or unresponsiveness of T cells (Fujinami, 2001) . These imply that viruses having molecular mimicry with self proteins are useful to vaccinate against autoimmune disease. Using molecular biology and DNA manipulation methods, it has also been possible to express mimic proteins in adequate live vectors (Arnon and Ben-Yedidia, 2003) and thereby design transgenic vector vaccines (Janewa et al., 2004; Roitt et al., 1998) against autoimmune disease. The development of vaccines has been an important contribution of autoimmune disease therapy and public health.",

We assume a ''Malthusian growth rate'' k in viral agents, which decay at a rate u as considered in Nowak et al. (1991) . The parameters a and g represent the decay rate of damaged and cross-reactive immune cells, respectively. The function g\u00f0T\u00de is the ''target cell growth function''. In Iwami et al.

A form of this function considerably affects the dynamics of autoimmune disease (Iwami et al., 2007a; Iwami, 2007) . However, to examine the effect of viral infection with molecular mimicry specifically, we consider that target cells are always constant T \u00bc T \u00c3 (we omit target cell dynamics). This assumption is justified by some homeostatic ability of organs, which exactly balances the growth of target cells with the damage. A modeling approach of this kind is used in Nowak and May (1994) . On the other hand, the assumption is not biologically unnatural if the target cells are abundant in the organ. We leave the inclusion of target cell dynamics as a subject for future work. We can model the vicious cycle in the following form:",

After emergence of autoimmunity, the vector vaccine can reproduce itself, induce a cross-reactive immune response, and be removed by the immune response in patients as a similar mechanism for viral infection with molecular mimicry (see Fig. 7 ). Therefore, we can consider that the vaccine can be described similarly as the viral infection in terms of the mathematical model. Fujinami (2001) and Fujinami et al. (2006) , explained that a possible mechanism of protection from EAE by the viral infection might be suppression of autoreactive immune cells caused by regulatory cells, AICD, and so on. However, our results demonstrate that a viral infection in model (3) can be effective for autoimmune disease without involving these suppressive effects. This shows that, when the immune response function is f 2 , the vector vaccine can reduce the cross-reactive immune response \u00f0I \u00fe a 4I \u00c3 c \u00de and relieve symptoms of autoimmune disease \u00f0D \u00fe a 4D \u00c3 c \u00de, which implies that the vector vaccine can be effective by itself even if we consider no additional suppressive abilities in our immune system. Therefore, to make the vector vaccine effective, we at least require that the immune proliferation be a sigmoid function such as f 2 (we explain the immune response function in Discussion). The affinities with self and non-self antigen are in the beneficial region, as shown in Fig. 6 . Actually, our immune system has high affinity with non-self antigen and low affinity with self antigen because, in the process of differentiation thymic, lymphocytes undergo positive and negative selection. Positive selection generates a functional T cell repertoire restricted to self MHC expressed on the epithelial cells of the thymic cortex. Negative selection eliminates T cells that are aggressively reactive to self antigen (Goldrath and Bevan, 1999; Janewa et al., 2004) . Consequently, the beneficial region, which has high affinity with non-self antigen and low affinity with self antigen, is biologically realistic. Furthermore, the vector vaccine must replicate effectively in autoimmune disease patients, which means that the orbit converges to E \u00c3 c . We remark that the vaccine might be unable to replicate (the orbit converges to E \u00fe a ) according to patients' states because of bistability. Therefore, the vector vaccine might have to be used with other immunosuppressive drugs to switch the patient state from E \u00fe a to E \u00c3 c . Although many restrictions discussed above exist for the success of therapeutic vaccine, we can theoretically design the transgenic vector vaccine (because of these stringent restrictions, it is also true that the transgenic vector vaccine might only be effective to certain specific patient states). Moreover, if we consider the additional effects for suppression of autoreactive immune cells, these restrictions can be relaxed. However, we leave the inclusion of additional effects as a subject for future work.",

Viruses are an important factor that can precipitate autoimmune disease by various mechanisms (Fujinami, 2004; Pender, 2004; von Herrath et al., 2003) . For example, viruses that stimulate the production of IL-12, such as herpes simplex virus, human herpesvirus, influenza virus, and coronavirus, have been isolated from or have been associated with exacerbation of MS (Fujinami, 2001; Libbey and Fujinami, 2002; Monteiro et al., 1998; Whitton and Fujinami, 1999) . On the other hand, viruses can abrogate an ongoing autoimmune reaction by inducing apoptosis of autoreactive cells, by secreting various cytokines, or by immune suppression (Fujinami, 2001) . Nevertheless, it is difficult to obtain direct evidence for virus-induced initiation of autoimmune disease or protection from autoimmune disease because we are all infected by multiple viruses (Fujinami et al., 2006) .",

            "text": "In Iwami et al. (2007a) and Iwami (2007) , we investigated the influence of functional form of immune proliferation on autoimmune disease symptoms. We demonstrated that sigmoid function such as f 2 can induce a bistable structure and periodic behavior. As described in this paper, we omit the target cell dynamics and add the viral replication cycle compared with the model considered in Iwami et al. (2007a) . The difference of immune response functions also strongly affects the autoimmune disease symptoms. If the virus cannot establish a persistent infection \u00f0k \u00c0 uo0\u00de, then f 2 induces bistability (Fig. 3(c) ) but f 1 does not, then (Fig. 2(c) ). On the other hand, if the virus can replicate itself \u00f0k \u00c0 u40\u00de, then f 2 induces bistability and a periodic orbit (Fig. 3(d) ), but f 1 does not, then (Fig. 2(d) ). Consequently, the sigmoid function f 2 , which is biologically more reasonable (because APCs only slightly induce immune cells when only a few antigens exist, Iwami et al., 2007a) than the convex function f 1 represents various symptoms such as relapse in autoimmune disease. That slight inducement implies that the various symptoms of autoimmune disease might be related with the function. However, the results might not be sufficiently robust to the form of immune proliferation function. We need to know an appropriate proliferation function that has biological relevance. For example, APCs are known to induce immune cells only slightly when many antigens exist (high zone tolerance) (Janewa et al., 2004) . For that reason, we might have to use a bell-shaped proliferation function to consider high zone tolerance instead of the proliferation as an increasing function of antigen load (De Boer et al., 1993 . Consequently, a more complete understanding of immune proliferation must be the foundation for the development of a therapeutic vaccine.",

It has been suggested that a determinant spreading (self-antigen diversification) is a relapse mechanism (Lehmann et al., 1993) . Furthermore, in Borghans et al. (1998) , they showed that T cell regulatory circuitry induces autoimmune relapse using a simple mathematical model. Another possible mechanism of the relapse is considered as crossreactive immune responses through a process of molecular mimicry. In our model, relapses can also occur under the viral infection with molecular mimicry (in the absence of determinant spreading). The immune response function f 2 can induce a limit cycle that corresponds to relapse of autoimmune disease only when the virus can replicate itself (see Fig. 4 ). This implies that the viral infection engenders the relapse. Therefore, our model supports that the cross-reactive immune response is also a relapse mechanism.",

These activated immune cells (CTL and antibodies produced by plasma cells: I) attack infected cells (virus with molecular mimicry, V) and uninfected cells (target cells, T) because of the molecular mimicry. Dead and dying cells (damaged cells: D) are then phagocytosed by APCs, which can present a self antigen to autoreactive T cells.
