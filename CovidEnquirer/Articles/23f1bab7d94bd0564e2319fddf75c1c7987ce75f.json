Firstly, the existence and local stability of disease-free and endemic equilibria are investigated.

Finally, numerical simulations, including one limit cycle, two limit cycles, unstable homoclinic loop and many other phase portraits are presented. These results show that the psychological effect of diseases and the behavior change of the susceptible individuals may affect the final spread level of an epidemic. doi: bioRxiv preprint then \u2206 > 0 if and only if R 0 > R * , \u2206 = 0 if and only if R 0 = R * and \u2206 < 0 if and only if R 0 < R * .

Obviously, g 1 (I) is increasing with small I and decreasing with large I, that is, g 1 (I) is non-monotone. The function g 1 (I) can be used to interpret the psychological effect: for a very large number of infective individuals, the infection force may decrease as the number of infective individuals increases, since large number of infective may lead to the reducing of the number of contacts per unit time. For example, in 2003, epidemic outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) had such psychological effects on the general public (see [11] ), and aggressive measures and policies had been taken, such as border screening, mask wearing, quarantine, isolation, etc. And also [11] showed that either the number of infective individuals tends to zero as time evolves or the disease persists.

In Section 2, we give a full-scale analysis for the types and stability of equilibria E i (i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). We prove that system (2) can occur backward bifurcation and the backward bifurcation will disappear if a = 0. At equilibrium E i (i = 3, 5), degenerate Hopf bifurcation arises under certain conditions. When the critical condition \u03a8 i (i = 3, 5) satisfied, we calculate the Liapunov value of the weak focus and obtain the value 2 for the maximal multiplicity of weak focus, indicating that there exist at most two limit cycles around E i (i = 3, 5). In Fig. 6, and Fig. 8 , we give the phase portrait corresponding to equilibrium E 3 and E 5 about exhibiting a unique limit cycle and adding a new limit cycle after small perturbation of parameter \u039b and c. In Subsection 3.3, we proved that the model exhibits Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension 2 and codimension 3, under certain conditions. If parameter a = 0, the model can just have Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension 2, shown in [20] .",
