Methods: This analysis was part of the Community-Acquired Pneumonia immunization Trial in Adults (CAPiTA); a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 84 496 immunocompetent individuals aged !65 years. CAP was defined by clinical and radiological criteria, and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from all individuals referred to a sentinel centre with a clinical suspicion of pneumonia. Presence of influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1, 2, 3 and 4, human adeno-, boca-, corona-, metapneumo-, rhino-and respiratory syncytial viruses was determined by real-time PCR. Results: Of 3209 episodes of suspected pneumonia, viral aetiology was tested in 2917 and proportions with influenza virus, human metapneumovirus and respiratory syncytial virus were 4.6%, 2.5% and 3.1%, respectively. There were 1653 oropharyngeal swabs for PCR testing available from 1814 episodes that fulfilled criteria for CAP, yielding 23 first episodes of IA-CAP in the PCV13 and 35 in the in placebo groupdvaccine efficacy for IA-CAP of 34.4% (95% CI e11.1% to 61.2%; p 0.117). Annual influenza vaccination was received by 672 (87.2%) in the PCV13 group and 719 (87.7%) in the placebo group of the confirmed CAP cases. Conclusion: In a randomized study of 84 496 elderly individuals with a high uptake of influenza vaccination, PCV13 was not associated with a statistically significant reduction of influenza or virus-associated CAP. Overall incidence of non-influenza viral pneumonia was low. S.M. Huijts, Clin Microbiol Infect 2018;24:764",

            "text": "No statistically significant vaccine efficacy of PCV13 vaccination in the elderly on IA-CAP could be demonstrated in this study of 84 496 people with an average duration of follow up of 3.97 years. Yet, because of the low incidence of IA-CAP, a clinically relevant effect cannot be ruled out. PCV13 vaccination has been recommended for adults of 65 years and older in the USA since September 2014 [23] and observational studies after implementation may provide further evidence for the effects of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination on influenza infections.",
