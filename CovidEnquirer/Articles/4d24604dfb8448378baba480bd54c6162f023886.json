METHODS: We collected data from the University of Manitoba IBD Epidemiology Database, which contains records on all Manitobans diagnosed with IBD from 1984 through 2010 and matched controls. From 1970 individuals' records can be linked with those of their mothers, so we were able to identify siblings. All health care visits or hospitalizations during the neonatal and postnatal periods were available from 1970 through 2010. We collected data on infections, gastrointestinal illnesses, failure to thrive, and hospital readmission in the first year of life and sociodemographic factors at birth. From 1979, data were available on gestational age, Apgar score, neonatal admission to the intensive care unit, and birth weight. We compared incident rate of infections, gastrointestinal illnesses, and failure to thrive between IBD cases and matched controls as well as between IBD cases and siblings. RESULTS: Data on 825 IBD cases and 5999 matched controls were available from 1979. Maternal diagnosis of IBD was the greatest risk factor for IBD in offspring (odds ratio [OR], 4.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.08-6.67). When we assessed neonatal events, only being in the highest vs lowest socioeconomic quintile increased risk for later development of IBD (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.01-1.79). For events within the first year of life, being in the highest socioeconomic quintile at birth and infections (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.09-1.79) increased risk for developing IBD at any age. Infection in the first year of life was associated with diagnosis of IBD before age 10 years (OR, 3.06; 95% CI, 1.07-8.78) and before age 20 years (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.18-2.24). Risk for IBD was not affected by gastrointestinal infections, gastrointestinal disease, or abdominal pain in the first year of life. CONCLUSIONS: In a population-based study, we found infection within the first year of life to be associated with a diagnosis of IBD. This might be due to use of antibiotics or a physiologic defect at a critical age for gut microbiome development.",

However, there is emerging evidence of important dysbiotic changes in the gut microbiome in persons with IBD, such as reduced diversity and alterations in certain species. 1 A variety of factors can change the gut microbiome, such as antibiotic ingestion or dietary changes. However, the permanence of the gut microbiome changes may be dependent on the timing and/ or duration of what factor is introduced. The gut microbiome undergoes the most change from birth until 1-2 years of age, when the microbiota composition stabilizes. [2] [3] [4] Hence, events that promote alterations in the composition of the gut microbiome in the first year of life may have important effects on its more permanent composition. This, in turn, may impact on the ultimate development of IBD. Infections that impact on the gut microbiome and antibiotic use in the first year of life through their effects on the gut microbiome may, therefore, impact on the ultimate development of IBD.",

Each individual is identified by a unique personal health identification through which all health system contacts can be tracked dating back to 1984. In 1995, we validated an administrative definition of IBD based on frequency of health system contacts. 5 We identified all persons with IBD and created a matched cohort of controls, matching 10 controls without IBD by age, sex, and area of residence to each IBD case. Our administrative definition of IBD allowed updating our database with new cases on an ongoing basis. Starting in 1970, 6-digit family health registration numbers, shared by a mother and all of her offspring, have been used in Manitoba and allow for the accurate linkage of the health care utilization profiles of mothers with their children. 6 The infections included those likely to require antibiotic therapy and also viral infections; it was considered that, if a child was sufficiently ill to be admitted to hospital, even if the discharge diagnosis was that of a viral infection, at some point the child may have received antibiotic therapy. However, we also included a separate analysis excluding what were diagnosed as viral infections. We assessed for the occurrence of those events within the first year of life. We also assessed for those events within the first 3 years of life. Inpatient and outpatient diagnoses were combined in each category to increase the power to determine if any diagnoses with these conditions were associated with a later diagnosis of IBD. We assessed for maternal diagnosis of IBD and we assessed for mode of delivery (cesarean section vs vaginal",

We assessed for all diagnoses of IBD and then separately for diagnoses of Crohn's disease and for ulcerative colitis. Comparisons used Fisher's exact test for each category of clinical disease assessed, for socioeconomic status at birth, for rural vs urban residence at birth and for neonatal parameters (mode of delivery, gestational age, birth weight, Apgar score, and neonatal intensive care unit admission). Conditional logistic regression models estimated the odds of developing IBD compared to either matched controls or siblings, and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported for all individuals available from 1979 so that all variables could be included. We conducted a separate conditional logistic regression model for all individuals available since 1970, excluding the neonatal events available only since 1979 in the model.

The median age of the IBD cohort was 20.0 years (range, 1.0-39.0 years; 25 th percentile, 16; 75 th percentile, 25). A total of 6824 individuals (n \u00bc 825 for IBD cases and n \u00bc 5999 for controls) were available to examine all events dating back to 1979. The median age for this cohort was 17.0 years (range 1-30.0; 25 th percentile, 13; 75 th percentile, 21). This cohort including data dating back to 1979 was used for the following analyses. Among IBD cases, 97 were diagnosed before age 10 years, 499 were diagnosed between ages 10-20 years, and 229 were diagnosed after age 20 years. The strongest predictor for development of IBD in all models was maternal history of IBD (OR, 4.53; 95% CI, 3.08-6.67 in the model including all neonatal and first year of life events). The model assessing all neonatal events and events in the first year of life found that being in the highest or the second highest socioeconomic quintile at birth vs the lowest (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.01-1.79 and OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.06-1.77, respectively) and infections within the first year of life were associated with later development of IBD at any age (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.09-1.79) ( Table 1) . When assessing Crohn's disease (n \u00bc 482) separately from ulcerative colitis (n \u00bc 343), maternal history of IBD was strongly predictive for both diseases, and having an infection in the first year life trended toward being predictive but did not reach statistical significance in either disease (Tables 2 and 3 ). Being in a higher socioeconomic status at birth compared to the lowest quintile was predictive of developing ulcerative colitis for all 4 socioeconomic quintiles above the lowest. Assessing neonatal events only, for later development of IBD, the only predictors of later development of IBD were being in the highest vs lowest socioeconomic status by quintile (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.01-1.79) or being in the second highest versus lowest socioeconomic quintile (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.06-1.77).",

This might reflect either an important genetic effect or an important environmental effect or a combination of both. Children share a close environment with their mothers, especially in their developing years, and it has been shown that the gut microbiome of children increasingly mirrors that of their parents' gut microbiome from the second through the sixth month of life. 8 We also found that persons with IBD were significantly more likely to be born into higher socioeconomic status families. The association between higher socioeconomic status and IBD may be reflective of the hygiene hypothesis, which posits that a cleaner lifestyle is associated with an increase in chronic immune diseases. [9] [10] [11] This lifestyle may involve less risk for childhood infections, cleaner water sources and toilet facilities, and less home crowding. It also may reflect greater attention to health care. Being born into a higher socioeconomic lifestyle may impact on duration of breastfeeding and timing and types of foods that are introduced in the first year of life. 12 Because higher socioeconomic status at birth poses a risk for developing IBD, and prolonged breastfeeding may be protective against developing IBD, then further research will need to tease out which has a greater impact on ultimate development of IBD. 12 We have previously shown that among persons ultimately diagnosed with IBD, compared to controls there was no difference in likelihood of initiating breastfeeding just after delivery, 13 however, studies are needed to ascertain whether the duration of breastfeeding, as well as the exclusivity of breastfeeding (to what extent or at what age formula or table food was introduced) impact on the development of IBD. This will require a prospective study. Being born in rural vs urban settings was predictive of developing IBD (more specifically Crohn's disease) among children under age 10 years, but not for IBD diagnoses at other ages. This contrasts with a Canada-wide report that suggested that rural residence was protective against developing IBD mostly among children who lived rurally under age 5 years, but found a wide variation among provinces. 14 When we assessed a larger sample size excluding neonatal events and assessing maternal and demographic factors with data going back to 1970 (n \u00bc 1670 for persons with IBD), being born rural was protective against developing IBD. Further research is required to determine what aspects of a higher family socioeconomic status at birth and family life in general contribute to an increased risk of chronic immune diseases, especially IBD.",

Limiting antibiotic usage in the management of routine infections could be desirable; however, it would be difficult to curb antibiotic use for many of the infections as serious as the ones we assessed. If it is increasingly accepted that antibiotics in the first year of life truly pose a risk for later chronic immune disease like IBD, then research is warranted to determine exactly what antibiotic intake does to infant gut microflora or intestinal or systemic immune responses. Interventions such as probiotic or prebiotic use could be considered after a course of antibiotics in children to prevent development of IBD or other chronic immune diseases. 18 It was particularly noteworthy that there were no differences among possible predictive factors for persons with IBD compared to their unaffected sibling controls. Those ultimately developing IBD compared to their unaffected siblings had similar neonatal events and similar events within the first of life in relation to infections and need for hospitalizations. As infection in the first year of life (and possibly the use of antibiotics to treat infection) is an important risk factor in our comparison of IBD cases with controls, it is uncertain why incidence of infection was not different for cases in comparison with sibling controls. Perhaps this suggests that because cases and siblings share genetics and environment, something unique must be occurring to cases that has not occurred to their unaffected siblings. Perhaps the genes not shared by the unaffected sibling include protective genes, which suggest a closer genetic evaluation of the differences between affected persons and their unaffected siblings may be fruitful. Secondly, while siblings share an environment and likely a similar diet while growing up, our findings suggest that there must be some environmental differences that we have not captured with our analyses. This may warrant a careful scrutiny of the diet and environment of unaffected siblings at the time of index case diagnosis. Some of those unaffected siblings may become affected over time, but many will not. The timing of the assessment of the unaffected siblings' environment and personal health attributes is critical.",

While we examined the most serious infections experienced by children in our hospital setting, we could not assess definitively which of the conditions were associated with antibiotic prescriptions. It is speculative whether the association of infections in the first year of life with ultimate diagnosis of IBD at all ages is actually related to antibiotic use. It is possible that there are other factors that are as or more important in the first year of life that may increase the risk for IBD, such as diet, or duration of or exclusivity of breastfeeding in the first year of life. Further, other environmental factors in the home, such as smoking, may contribute to the risk for IBD. It is also possible that for onset of IBD into late teenage years and adulthood, there are other factors that overwhelm any risk posed by early life events. However, we did find the strongest association between infection in the first year of life and childhoodonset IBD. In fact, our data support the likelihood that triggers for IBD arising in children may very well be different from triggers that ultimately lead to adult-onset IBD. Risk factors posed from the diet or an environmental factor, such as smoking, may occur well after the first year of life. Because not everyone exposed to infections (or antibiotics) in their first year of life develop IBD, it is also possible that variables such as protective dietary factors experienced later in childhood may protect against the potential risk posed by harmful infections or the antibiotics used to treat them.",

Gastrointestinal illnesses, including abdominal pain, in the first year of life did not pose a risk for later development of IBD. Neonatal events that reflect infant health at birth did not predict later development of IBD. Together with our past reports that neither cesarean section birth nor antenatal or perinatal maternal use of antibiotics predict ultimate development of IBD, it seems that neonatal changes to the microbiome are subsumed by those occurring in the first year of life. Studies should explore the infant gut microbiome before and for several months after infections and/or antibiotic use to determine what changes occur that might promote the development of IBD later.Supplementary MaterialNote: To access the supplementary material accompanying this article, visit the online version of Gastroenterology at www.gastrojournal.org, and at https://doi.org/10.1053/j. gastro.2019.02.004.",
