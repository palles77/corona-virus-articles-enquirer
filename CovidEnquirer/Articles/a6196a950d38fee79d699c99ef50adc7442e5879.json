Introduction Antiviral agents are drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment or control of viral infections. The development of antiviral agents is not trivial as viral replication is intricately linked with the host cell that any antiviral drug that interferes even to a lesser extent with host cell factors may be toxic to the host depending on the duration and dosage used. Available antiviral agents mainly target stages in the viral life cycle. The target stages in the viral life cycle are; viral attachment to host cell, uncoating, synthesis of viral mRNA, translation of mRNA, replication of viral RNA and DNA, maturation of new viral proteins, budding, release of newly synthesized virus, and free virus in body fluids. Antiviral agents used to treat viral diseases are currently limited, and at least half of the available agents are for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. The others are used for the management of herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human papillomavirus (HPV), and influenza virus-related diseases.",

            "text": "Viruses could stay in the cells as episomal form, or are incorporated into host chromosomal DNA without engaging in active viral replication (i.e., viral latency state). An ideal antiviral agent should be effective against both actively replicating and latent viruses; however, most of the available antiviral agents are effective against only replicating viruses. The goals for treating acute viral infections in immunocompetent patients are to reduce the severity of the illness and its complications and to decrease the rate of transmission of the virus. The therapeutic index, or ratio of efficacy to toxicity, must be extremely high in order for the therapy to be acceptable. For chronic viral infections, the goal is to prevent viral damage to visceral organs, and therefore efficacy becomes paramount. Antiviral agents can be used for prophylaxis, suppression, preemptive therapy, or treatment of overt disease. Two important factors that can limit the utility of antiviral drugs are toxicity and the development of resistance to the antiviral agent by the virus. In addition, host phenotypic behaviors toward antiviral drugs because of either genomic or epigenetic factors could limit the efficacy of an antiviral agent in an individual. This article summarizes the most relevant pharmacologic and clinical properties of the available antiviral agents.",

Chemistry, mechanism of action, and antiviral activity Acyclovir [9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl) guanine] is a synthetic acyclic purine nucleoside analogue that lacks the 39-hydroxyl group of nucleosides. Acyclovir is phosphorylated to the active triphosphate metabolite that inhibits viral DNA synthesis (Figure 1 ). Viral encoded thymidine kinases (TK), present in only herpesvirus-infected cells, catalyze the phophorylation to acyclovir monophosphate. Host cell TK or other kinases cannot phosphorylate acyclovir to its monophosphate metabolite efficiently. Acyclovir is highly selective for cells engaged in active viral replication and does not affect noninfected cells.",

            "text": "The monophosphate is subsequently phosphorylated to the di-, and triphosphate by cellular kinases, resulting in acyclovir triphosphate concentrations much higher in HSV-infected than in uninfected cells. Acyclovir triphosphate inhibits viral DNA synthesis by competing with deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) as a substrate for viral DNA polymerase, as illustrated in Figure 1 . Since acyclovir triphosphate lacks the 39-hydroxyl group required for DNA chain elongation, the growing chain of DNA is terminated. In addition, the incorporated acyclovir can trap viral DNA polymerase and prevent it from initiating other viral DNA replication. The viral polymerase has a greater affinity for acyclovir triphosphate than cellular DNA polymerase, resulting in little incorporation of acyclovir into cellular DNA. In vitro, acyclovir is most active against HSV-1 (average EC 50 \u00bc 0.04 mg ml \u00c01 ), HSV-2 (0.10 mg ml \u00c01 ), and VZV (0.50 mg ml \u00c01 ). Varicella virus is much less susceptible to acyclovir than is HSV, and hence, higher doses of acyclovir are required in the treatment of VZV infections. EBV TK has poor efficiency to utilize acyclovir as substrate, therefore, higher acyclovir concentrations are required for EBV inhibition. CMV, which lacks a virus-specific TK, is relatively resistant. The bioavailability of oral formulations of acyclovir is 15-30%. Peak concentrations of approximately 0.57 and 1.57 mg ml \u00c01 are attained after multidose oral administration of 200 or 800 mg of acyclovir, respectively. Higher plasma acyclovir levels are achieved with intravenous administration. The plasma half-life is 2-3 h in older children and adults with normal renal function and 2.5-5 h in neonates with normal creatinine clearance. The elimination of acyclovir is prolonged in individuals with renal dysfunction, with a half-life of approximately 20 h in persons with end-stage renal disease. Acyclovir is minimally metabolized and approximately 85% is excreted unchanged in the urine via renal tubular secretion and glomerular filtration. ",

Chemistry, mechanism of action, and antiviral activity Cidofovir, (S)-1-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl) cytosine (HPMPC), is an acyclic phosphonate nucleotide analogue of deoxycytidine monophosphate. Cidofovir has a single phosphate group attached therefore it does not require viral enzymes for conversion to the monophosphate, cellular kinases sequentially phosphorylate the monophosphate to its active triphosphate metabolite. The triphosphate metabolite then serves as a competitive inhibitor of DNA polymerase. The active form of the drug exhibits a 25-to 50-fold greater affinity for the viral DNA polymerase, compared with the cellular DNA polymerase, thereby selectively inhibiting viral replication. Owing to its unique phosphorylation requirements for activation, cidofovir usually maintains activity against acyclovir-and foscarnet-resistant HSV isolates, as well as ganciclovir-and foscarnet-resistant CMV mutants. Cidofovir is less potent than acyclovir in vitro; however, cidofovir persists in cells for prolonged periods, increasing drug activity. In addition, cidofovir produces active metabolites with long half-lives (17-48 h), permitting once weekly dosing. Cidofovir has in vitro activity against VZV, EBV, HHV-6, HHV-8, HPV, polyomaviruses, orthopoxviruses, and adenovirus.

It has 8-20 times greater in vitro activity against CMV, and as active as acyclovir against HSV-1 and HSV-2 and almost as active against VZV. Like acyclovir, the first step of phosphorylation to ganciclovir monophosphate in herpesvirus-infected cells depends on virus-encoded enzymes. In cells infected by HSV-1 or HSV-2, TK catalyzes the phosphorylation of ganciclovir to ganciclovir monophosphate. Because CMV lacks the gene for TK, the enzyme that catalyzes the initial phosphorylation of ganciclovir in CMV-infected cells is the phosphotransferase encoded by UL97 gene. The final phosphorylation steps to the di-and triphosphate is by cellular kinases. Ganciclovir triphosphate serves as a competitive inhibitor of herpes viral DNA polymerase and inhibits the incorporation of guanosine triphosphate into viral DNA. Incorporation of ganciclovir triphosphate into the growing viral chain results in slowing and subsequent cessation of DNA chain elongation.

Chemistry, mechanism of action, and antiviral activity Penciclovir [9-(4-hydroxy-3-hydroxymethylbut-1-yl)] a guanine nucleoside analogue is structurally similar to ganciclovir, differing only be the substitution of a methylene bridge for the ether oxygen in the acyclic ribose part of the molecule. Its metabolism and mechanism of action are similar to those of acyclovir, except that it is not an obligate DNA-chain terminator. The in vitro inhibitory effects of penciclovir on HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV are similar to those of acyclovir. The oral bioavailability of penciclovir is poor (<5%).

It is well absorbed after oral administration and is rapidly metabolized to penciclovir by deacetylation in the gastrointestinal tract, and liver, after which it is oxidized by the liver at the position 6 of the purine ring. Penciclovir is phosphorylated more efficiently than acyclovir in HSV-and VZV-infected cells. Host cell kinases phosphorylate both penciclovir and acyclovir to a small but comparable extent. The preferential metabolism in HSV-and VZV-infected cells is the major determinant of its antiviral activity. Penciclovir triphosphate has, on average, a tenfold longer intracellular half-life than acyclovir triphosphate in HSV-1-, HSV-2-, and VZV-infected cells after drug removal. Because penciclovir is more stable, it has longer antiviral activity, allowing for less frequent dosing. Both compounds have good activity against HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV. Penciclovir, like acyclovir, is relatively inactive against CMV and EBV. Penciclovir is active against hepatitis B.

Rimantadine is fourfold to tenfold more active than amantadine. The mechanism of action of these drugs relates to the influenza A virus M2 protein, an integral transmembrane protein that functions as an ion channel for this virus and is activated by pH. The drop in pH accompanying the hydrogen flux facilitates the dissociation of the M2 protein from the ribonucleoprotein complexes so that the ribonucleoprotein can enter the cell nucleus and initiate replication. By interfering with the function of the M2 protein, amantadine and rimantadine inhibit the acid-mediated dissociation of the matrix protein from the ribonuclear protein complex within endosomes. This event occurs early in the viral replication cycle. The consequences of these drugs are the potentiation of acidic pH-induced conformational changes in the viral hemagglutinin during its intracellular transport. Absorption of rimantadine is slower compared with that of amantadine. Amantadine is excreted unchanged in the urine by glomerular filtration and, likely, tubular secretion. The plasma elimination T 1/2 is approximately 12-18 h in individuals with normal renal function. However, the elimination T 1/2 increases in the elderly with impaired creatinine clearance. Rimantadine is extensively metabolized following oral administration, with an elimination T 1/2 of 24-36 h. Approximately 15% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine.",

Ribavirin is a nucleoside analogue whose mechanisms of action are poorly understood and probably not the same for all viruses; however, its ability to alter nucleotide pools and the packaging of mRNA appears important. This process is not virus specific, but there is a certain selectivity, in that infected cells produce more mRNA than noninfected cells. A major action is the inhibition by ribavirin-59-monophosphate of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme essential for DNA synthesis. This inhibition may have direct effects on the intracellular level of GMP and other nucleotide levels may be altered. The 59-triphosphate of ribavirin inhibits the formation of the 59-guanylation capping on the mRNA of vaccinia and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses. In addition, the triphosphate is a potent inhibitor of viral mRNA (guanine-7) methyltransferase of vaccinia virus.

Chemistry, mechanism of action, and antiviral activity Abacavir sulfate, (1S,4R)-4-[2-amino-6-(cyclopropylamino)-9H-purin-9-yl]-2-cyclopentene-1methanol, is a structural analogue of the purine guanine. The phosphorylation pathway of abacavir differs from that of all other nucleoside analogues. The first step in the conversion of abacavir to its active metabolite, carbovir triphosphate, is phosphorylation to abacavir monophosphate by adenosine phosphotransferase. This step is followed by deamination by a cytosolic enzyme to form carbovir monophosphate, which undergoes two subsequent phosphorylations, to the diphosphate by guanylate kinase and to the triphosphate by nucleoside diphosphate kinase and other enzymes. Carbovir triphosphate competes with endogenous 29-dGTP for incorporation into the nucleic acid chain, and after incorporation, terminates DNA chain elongation. Abacavir exhibits potent in vitro antiviral activity against wild-type HIV-1 (IC 50 4.0 mmol l \u00c01 ), but this activity is lower than the activity of zidovudine (IC 50 0.040 mmol l \u00c01 ).

Atazanavir-resistant clinical isolates from treatment-naive harbored the I50L mutation (after an average of 50 weeks of atazanavir therapy), often, in combination with an A71V mutation. However, the viral isolates with the I50L mutation are phenotypically resistant to atazanavir but show in vitro susceptibility to other protease inhibitors (amprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir).

In clinical trials tipranavir had less than fourfold decreased susceptibility against 90% of HIV-1 isolates resistant to amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir. Tipranavir-resistant viruses selected for in vitro have decreased susceptibility to the protease inhibitors amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir but remain sensitive to saquinavir. Chemistry, mechanism of action, and antiviral activity Darunavir, in the form of darunavir ethanolate, has the following chemical name: [(1S,2R)-3-[[(4-aminophenyl)sulfonyl](2-methylpropyl)amino]-2-hydroxy-1-(phenylmethyl) propyl]-carbamic acid (3R,3aS,6aR)-hexahydrofuro[2,3-b]furan-3-yl ester monoethanolate. It is an inhibitor of the HIV protease. Darunavir exhibits activity against laboratory strains and clinical isolates of HIV-1 and laboratory strains of HIV-2 with median EC 50 values ranging from 1.2 to 8.5 nmol l \u00c01 (0.7-5.0 ng ml \u00c01 ). Darunavir, coadministered with 100 mg ritonavir twice daily, was absorbed following oral administration with a T max of approximately 2.5-4 h. The absolute oral bioavailability of a single 600 mg dose of darunavir alone and after coadministration with 100 mg ritonavir twice daily was 37 and 82%, respectively. Darunavir is primarily metabolized by CYP3A. Ritonavir inhibits CYP3A, thereby increasing the plasma concentrations of darunavir when given in combination. Darunavir, coadministered with 100 mg ritonavir, and with other anti-HIV agents, is indicated for the treatment of HIV infection in antiretroviral treatment-experienced adult patients, such as those with HIV-1 strains resistant to more than one protease inhibitor.",

There are several nucleoside analogues in preclinical and clinical studies. Notably are the novel 49substituted thymidine analogues with potent antiviral activity and less cytotoxic. An example is the recently discovered 29,39-didehydro-39-deoxy-49-ethynylthymidine, structurally related to stavudine, is a more potent inhibitor of HIV-1 replication and is much less inhibitory to mitochondrial DNA synthesis and cell growth in cell cultures than its progenitor stavudine. The triphosphate metabolite accumulates in cells much longer than stavudine, and exerts persistent antiviral activity even after removal of drug from culture. It also has a unique resistance profile when compared to other thymidine analogues and maintains activity against multidrug resistant HIV strains. It is currently in preclinical studies with phase I and II clinical trials anticipated in 2008. Other new NRTIs in phase II clinical trials are MIV-310, SPD754, and L-d4FC. A new non-nucleoside analogue in phase II trials is TMC125, it appears to have potent antiviral activity in treatment-experienced patients with resistance mutations to this drug class or in patients who are treatment naive.
