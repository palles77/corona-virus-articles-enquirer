SARS-CoV which contains a chymotrypsin-like main protease analogous to that of the main picornavirus protease, 3CL pro . 3CL pro plays a pivotal role in the viral replication cycle and is a potential target for SARS inhibitor development. A series of isatin derivatives as possible SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitors was designed, synthesized, and evaluated by in vitro protease assay using fluorogenic substrate peptide, in which several showed potent inhibition against the 3CL pro . Structureactivity relationship was analyzed, and possible binding interaction modes were proposed by molecular docking studies. Among all compounds, 8k 1 showed most potent inhibitory activity against 3CL pro (IC 50 = 1.04 lM). These results indicated that these inhibitors could be potentially developed into anti-SARS drugs.",

            "text": "The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a serious lifethreatening upper respiratory tract disease with the most common symptoms of cough, high fever, headache, rigor, myalgia, and dizziness. 1 In 2003, SARS abruptly emerged and spread widely, becoming an epidemic that seriously affected public health and the economy of many countries. 2, 3 Although SARS has been controlled and no known SARS transmission has been recorded anywhere in the world, the mutant characteristic of the coronavirus that is the causative agent of SARS indicated the possibility of a re-emergence. [4] [5] [6] The emergence of the novel human coronavirus EMC (HCoV-EMC) in the Middle East since April 2012 has so far led to 17 cases of human infection (with 11 being fatal) as of 26 March 2013. 7 SARS virus is a novel human coronavirus featuring the largest positive-stranded RNA genomes known to date (27-31 kb) and is also termed SARS-CoV. CoV encodes a chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro ) that plays a pivotal role in the virus replication. The cysteine protease 3CL pro is fuctionally analogous to the main Picornaviridae protease 3C pro with a catalytic dyad (Cys-145 and His-41) in the active site. 8 3CL pro Cleaves the replicase polyprotein at 11 conserved sites with canonical Leu-Gln (Ser, Ala, Gly) sequences, in which the P1 position has a well-conserved Gln residue and the P2 position has a hydrophobic amino acid residue. 9, 10 Given the essential role in viral processing of SARS-CoV 3CL pro , it is considered as an attractive target for anti-SARS and other coronavirus infections.",

Although this complex has not been deposited in the protein data bank because of the poor structural quality, this fact provided us with an important clue that isatin derivatives can have inhibitory activity against 3CL pro . Previously, Chen and Zhou et al. 35, 36 reported a new class of potent, small-molecule isatin-based 3CL pro inhibitors (Fig. 2 ). They concluded that the C-5 position favors a carboxamide group and the N-1 position favors large hydrophobic substituents. In this Letter, we investigated a replacement of the carboxamide group using a series of substituted sulfonamide groups in isatin. We believe that this modification can improve inhibitory activity against SARS CoV 3CL pro . We also carried out molecular docking studies to obtain the potential binding mode of these inhibitors.",

The resulting hydroxyiminoacetanilide intermediates 2g and 2i were cyclized by heating in concentrated sulfuric acid to give the corresponding isatin derivatives 3g and 3i, respectively. 37 A series of compounds 8 was prepared from isatin following literature methods 38, 39 (Scheme 2). In a typical procedure, isatin was sulfonated at the 5-position in the presence of chlorosulfonic acid. However, in contrast to previously published results, both 5-sulfonated gem-dichloroisatin 4 and 5-sulfonated isatin 5 were isolated, and the yield ratio was 9:1. Moreover, no desired sulfonyl chloride product was obtained. Interestingly, both 4 and 5 can react with secondary amines, respectively. Especially, 5 can directly produce compound 7 in high yield. In this paper, the mixture of compounds 4 and 5 was not isolated and was applied to synthesize target compounds 7 and 8, and the gem-dichloro moiety of intermediate 6 was subjected to acidic hydrolysis to afford 7.

            "text": "To predict the binding mode of isatin 5-sulfonylamide onto the active site of SARS CoV 3CL pro (PDB code 1UK4) using Glide 5.5 (Glide model in Schrodinger software), compounds 7k, 8k 1 , and 8k 2 were docked into the active site. As shown in Figure 3 , compound 8k 1 was hydrogen bonded in Gly143 and Cys145 of protease, and 8k 2 generated hydrogen bonds with Gly143, Ser144, and Asn142. Notably, both carbonyl group at the 2-position and nitrogen atom at the 1-position of isatin are important in the formation of hydrogen bonds. Meanwhile, the modeling shown in Figure 4 revealed that the isatin scaffold was docked at the S1 0 site, and the side chain R 2 and R 3 were located at the S2 and S1 sites of SARS CoV 3CL pro , respectively. The model of compounds and SARS-CoV 3CL pro presented here differed from previously reported 5-carboxamide isatin derivatives. 36 The orientation of the isatin core was flipped here in Fig. 4 . The substitutions at the 5-position enabled the compounds 8k 1 and 8k 2 to fit the S2 hydrophobic site in both docking results. Furthermore, the simple six-membered ring sulfonyl group of isatin at the 5-position well fitted S2, as demonstrated in the potent inhibition of 7a and 7i-m. However, the 5-sulfonyl isatin derivatives 7b-h modified by rigid bicyclic substituents at the 5-position did not fit the limited space of S2, which led to diminished inhibitory activity. Interestingly, increasing the length of substitution enabled compounds containing the flexible group 7d-g to extend into the S3 site, which has not been mentioned in previous references. These docking experiments supported the observation in the enzymatic assay that the potency of these derivatives followed the order 7d (31.71 lM) > 7a (76.74 lM) > 7b (>100 lM). Regarding the substituent at the N-1 position, the 5-carboxamide group 36 was replaced by N-1 substitution here and the methyl and benzyl substitutions more or less accommodated the hydrophobic characteristics at the S1 site. In addition, 8k 1 molecule (total score = 8.70) was predicted to show the analogous binding affinity relative to 8k 2 (total score = 8.58), which was consistent with the experimental results. Based on the findings above, we believe that the activity of the title compounds can be improved by modifying with the simple six-membered ring at the 5-position and substitution at the N-1 position with a methyl group, which can lead to a better combination of compounds with the protein pocket. derivatives resulted in the discovery of compound 8k 1 , with the most powerful potency (IC 50 = 1.04 lM). The results of the current study suggested that 5-sulfonyl isatin derivatives had similar inhibitory activities to the reported 5-carbonyl isatins. Meanwhile, the computer model of the associated complex between the title compounds and protease rationalized their inhibitory activities. Apparently, 5-sulfonyl isatin modified by a simple six-membered ring or a bulky substituent with sufficient flexibility at the 5-position coupled with methyl at the N-1 position could dramatically promote inhibitory activity. In addition, similar orientations of the isatin core were found in both docking and socking studies. This result could serve as an important basis for more structural optimizations.",

The natural substrate amino acid sequence (AVLQSGFRKK) of SARS-CoV 3CL pro started with the MCA fluorescent group and connected the Dnp fluorescence quenching group with penultimate K. The screening system was as follows (Table 1) : the final concentrations of SARS-CoV 3CL pro , substrate, and compound were 0.5 lM, 16 lM and 1 mM, respectively. The settled concentration of protein, compounds were preheateded at 37\u00b0C and oscillated, and the substrate was added to the mixture above. The excitation/emission light was 320/405 nm, and the test was carried out every 3 s for 60 times. Drawing curves, the maximum value of the negative control curve slope was V 0 , and the largest compound curve slope was V 1 . The inhibition ratio was defined as 1\u00c0V 1 /V 0 , and IC 50 Value was obtained by the equation: V 0 /V = 1 + [I]/IC 50 , where V 0 is the initial rate of the reaction without inhibitor, V is the initial rate of reaction with the inhibitor at various concentrations, and [I] is the inhibitor concentration. Crystals were then transferred to a cryoprotectant solution consisting of 70% crystallization buffer, 20% (v/v) glycol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. Crystallographic data were routinely collected in a conventional, in-house Rigaku X-ray generator with an R-AXIS 944+ detector at a wavelength of 1.5418 \u00c5. Data were processed and reduced with HKL-2000 package. A total of 360 frames were collected with 0.5\u00b0oscillation angle. Exposure times were 30 s/frame. This strategy resulted in >95% completeness in the vast majority of the data sets with reducing R factors between 5% and 9%. Data were processed with HKL2000 and scaled with SCALEPACK. Phase and map calculations were performed using PHASER. The modeling and electron-density fitting software COOT was used to manipulate the models.",
