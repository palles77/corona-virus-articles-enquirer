This study describes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and myocarditis associated with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection in five cats aged between 1 and 4 years. Clinical manifestations included dyspnoea in four animals, one of which also exhibited restlessness. One animal showed only lethargy, anorexia and vomiting. Necropsy examination revealed marked cardiomegaly, marked left ventricular hypertrophy and pallor of the myocardium and epicardium in all animals. Microscopical and immunohistochemical examination showed multifocal infiltration of the myocardium with T lymphocytes and fewer macrophages, neutrophils and plasma cells. An intense immunoreaction for FIV antigen in the cytoplasm and nucleus of lymphocytes and the cytoplasm of some macrophages was observed via immunohistochemistry (IHC). IHC did not reveal the presence of antigen from feline calicivirus, coronavirus, feline leukaemia virus, feline parvovirus, Chlamydia spp. or Toxoplasma gondii. The results demonstrate the occurrence of FIV infection in inflammatory cells in the myocardium of five cats with myocarditis and HCM.",

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) have been detected in myocarditis lesions in man and apes, respectively (Barbaro et al., 1998; Yearley et al., 2006; Pozzan et al., 2009) . However, the ability of HIV to infect cardiomyocytes is surrounded by controversy, as the entry pathway of HIV into these cells has not been established, given that they do not express CD4 receptors (Barbaro et al., 2001; Currie and Boon, 2003) . Moreover, it is likely that other factors also play a role in the aetiopathogenesis of HIV-induced heart lesions, such as opportunistic infections, the immune response to the viral infection, cardiotoxic drugs, malnutrition and prolonged immunosuppression (Sani, 2008) .",

Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and sections of myocardium were also stained by Grocott's methenamine silver and modified BrowneHopps (Gram) protocols. Tissue sections were subjected to IHC to detect the following pathogens: FIV, feline calicivirus (FCV), feline coronavirus, feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), FPV, Chlamydia spp. and T. gondii. The inflammatory infiltrate was also characterized by IHC using markers specific for CD3 (T lymphocytes), CD79 (B lymphocytes) and lysozyme (macrophages). The IHC protocols are described in Table 1 . Positive controls included previously tested samples that were assessed simultaneously with the test slides. Negative controls consisted of tissue samples incubated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) instead of primary antibody.

However, a positive immunoreaction was observed in the dendritic and interstitial cells in only one case of myocarditis of undetermined cause (Pozzan et al., 2009) . The comparatively higher rate of identification achieved using PCR may be related to the greater sensitivity of this technique. Here, the performance of IHC was satisfactory in that it afforded a good degree of sensitivity, with positive immunoreaction being observed in all cats with myocarditis.",
