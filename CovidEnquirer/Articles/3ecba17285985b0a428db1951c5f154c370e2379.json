            "text": "Although inequality is often measured through three critical indicators-education, income and life expectancy-health-related differences are also essential elements for explaining levels of equality or inequality in modern societies. Investment and investigation in health also involve inequalities at the global level, and this includes insufficient North-South transfer of funds, technology and expertise in the health field, including the specific area of communicable diseases. Globally, epidemics and outbreaks in any geographic region can represent international public health emergencies, and this type of threat requires a global response. Therefore, given the need to strengthen the global capacity for dealing with threats of infectious diseases, a framework is needed for collaboration on alerting the world to epidemics and responding to public health emergencies. This is necessary to guarantee a high level of security against the dissemination of communicable diseases in an ever more globalized world. In response to these needs, international health agencies have put a number of strategies into practice in order to contribute to the control of communicable diseases in poor countries. The principle strategies include: 1) implementation of mechanisms for international epidemiologic surveillance; 2) use of international law to support the control of communicable diseases; 3) international cooperation on health matters; 4) strategies to strengthen primary care services and health systems in general; 5) promotion of the transfer of resources for research and development from the North to the South. \u00d3 2005 IMSS.

Infectious diseases constitute the second cause of death worldwide, are an incalculable source of human suffering and cause immense economic loss at every level. In point of fact, 26% of all deaths worldwide and 30% of the global burden of disease can be attributed to infectious diseases ( Figure 1 ). Unfortunately, not only are the majority of these deaths potentially preventable, but over 95% occur in developing countries, where poverty is often the common denominator. The three infectious diseases that cause the largest number of deaths are HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.",

This essay reviews these efforts, beginning with the mechanisms created to facilitate international epidemiologic surveillance. The use of international health law as a tool for global collaboration on the control of communicable diseases is also touched upon. Next, international cooperation on a range of health matters and efforts to strengthen primary health care and health systems in general in poor countries are referred to. Finally, a discussion is included about how international agencies facilitate the North-South transfer of resources for research and development and contribute to the implementation of these investments in the areas of research, surveillance systems and improvements to health.",

Epidemics and outbreaks in local regions can represent an international public health emergency. Although such situations require a global response, there is no single institution with the ability to guarantee health safety worldwide.

Therefore, the WHO and PAHO have been involved in coordinating the review and modification of the International Health Regulation, which constitutes a series of guidelines for cooperation by countries on the control of disease outbreaks (6) . The recognition of the need for changes in the International Health Regulation grew out of the emergence of new infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS, see Box 2), (7) as well as the resurgence of re-emerging infectious diseases which for the Latin American region include cholera (8) and typhoid fever (9) , while in Africa reemerging diseases that indicate the need for this modernization of health regulations include influenza, (10) measles (11) and cholera (12) as well ( Figure 2 ). The efforts to modify the International Health Regulation proceed from an understanding of the issues raised by increasing globalization; specifically, public health emergencies with international repercussions. Important in this respect is the need to take into account the potential for the international spread of an emerging or re-emerging disease while also measuring the repercussions for the free circulation of people and goods (2) .",

More than 400 Ebola cases were isolated and treated and 6,000 contacts were tracked. After initial containment of the outbreak, follow-up was carried out through a community-based early warning surveillance system, establishment a field laboratory and creation of an isolation ward. GOARN provided logistic support and coordination in the field, which made quick and effective control of the outbreak possible (30). through national epidemiologic surveillance and international coordination as part of an effective response to public health emergencies of international importance.

One of the reasons this situation exists is simply that communicable diseases make up a much larger proportion of the burden of disease in underdeveloped countries as compared to developed ones (see Box 3) (22) . A related problem is that research priorities are different in richer countries where chronic diseases are a priority than in poorer nations where infectious diseases and malnutrition are of greater concern. Even when chronic diseases constitute an important proportion of the burden of disease in developing (often middle-income) countries, research needs may be different from those in developed nations. Specifically, interventions to prevent chronic diseases, or to improve adherence to treatment once acquired, which may be successful in developed countries can be either not feasible or inappropriate (in cultural, social or economic terms) in developing nations. In addition, the development of vaccines in developed countries, for the control of communicable diseases, can be of little use in poorer nations, where they may be ineffective given the existence of different viral strains or bacterium. Quality of health care services is quite heterogeneous from one country to another, both when comparing developing countries with one another or with their developed country counterparts, which again implies different research and funding needs. Finally, the high cost of patented medicines and medical technology limits their transferability from richer to poorer nations.",

There are a number of perspectives from which an analysis of these issues can be carried out, including a focus on the economic, health or human rights aspects of priority setting. In economic terms, there has been an increase in investment in health research, from 30 billion USD in 1990 (24) to 73.5 billion USD in 2001 (25) . The health sector generates trillions of dollars at the global level; among the products and services to be invested in are prevention of disease and health promotion, as well as diagnosis and treatment. The World Bank is the agency that provides the largest amount of health-related financing worldwide, at close to one billion USD each year. The World Bank's principal health-related aims are to contribute to the improvement of the health of the poor and to the reduction of the impoverishing effects of disease, as well as increasing equitable access to health care and promoting sustainable financing for health systems (26) . The 1.3 billion USD provided by the World Bank for the fight against HIV/AIDS in recent years constitutes an example of how the emergence of a public health problem-specifically an emerging disease-can lead to the creation of new investment priorities in terms of health research, prevention activities and treatment.",

These indicators would seem to indicate a lack of equity in the way health research priorities are established, which in turn translate into insufficient North-South transfer of applicable After antibiotics began to be used to treat tuberculosis patients in developed countries beginning in the 1940s, the control programs for this disease underwent radical transformations in these nations and tuberculosis incidence and mortality rates declined steadily in the industrialized world. The developed nations began to ignore the disease, and resources available to developing countries for dealing with it dried up. The treatment options used in developed nations were unaffordable for developing countries, where instead strategies such as ambulatory care and passive case detection were preferred in order to lower treatment costs and avoid expensive mass screening. Studies carried out in developing contexts produced useful schemes for other resource poor settings. Investigation undertaken in India confirmed the effectiveness of treatment of tuberculosis in patients' homes and provided alternatives to costly mass screening. Research supported by the Ministry of Health of Tanzania provided the groundwork for the development of DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment Shortcourse), which is now the leading global intervention against tuberculosis. However, these research results were not applied in many poor countries, given the almost total absence of tuberculosis on the international health agenda and especially the lack of funding. It was not until tuberculosis incidence began to rise in developed countries such as the United States and a number of European nations in the 1980s that international concern was again focused on this disease, including resources. At this juncture, the World Bank made tuberculosis a priority and provided loans for the implementation of WHO-DOTS, after which 120 countries adopted this scheme (16) .",

Perhaps the most heart-wrenching example of this is the fact that epidemiologic surveillance and especially therapeutic interventions for HIV/AIDS are not available in poorer countries, where the large majority of people living with the disease are concentrated (90% of people living with HIV/ AIDS reside in developing countries, and only 4% of the 6 million people living with the disease in resource poor areas received antiretroviral treatment in 2002 (27) .",

The WHO, through the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), worked with local health authorities in the affected countries, providing epidemiologic, clinical and logistic support. This original outbreak was brought under control in 2003, although isolated outbreaks of SARS have occurred since. A SARS vaccine is currently in clinical trials in China(31,32).",

The initial eradication strategies failed for a number of reasons, including the development of resistance to DDT, a lack of high quality epidemiological knowledge and managing capacity as well as the inadequacy of the health care systems that existed in less developed countries. Although for at least two decades malaria ceased to be an international priority, research continued, including the development of antimalarial drugs and attempts at vaccine development supported by such international agencies as the WHO, the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and USAID. During the last decade of the twentieth century a different set of strategies was developed, including evaluation of national malaria situations by a number of African countries and joint efforts to strengthen malaria control programs by African governments and the WHO, which were financed primarily by the World Bank but also with resources from G8 countries, the European Commission and development banks. It was this transnational alliance of international agencies and national governments and a more complex and realistic appraisal of the work needed to control malaria (instead of relying on a single strategy, DDT use) that constituted perhaps the most important difference between these two phases in the fight against malaria (16) .",
