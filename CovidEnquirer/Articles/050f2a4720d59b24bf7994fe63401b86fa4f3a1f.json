Immunization of infants and susceptible women of child-bearing age against RV is now a standard public health measure. However, there are still major medical concerns: the reinfection of vaccinees by wild-type RV and the risk of both congenital infection of the fetus and rubella-associated arthritis arising from vaccination (Chantler et a/., 1982; Fraser et a/., 1983; Sandra et a/., 1985) .

The results indicated that T cell clones Rl 1 and R18 had the ability to kill autologous EBV-BL target cells incubated with peptide C6 and that T cell clones A2 and Al 1, Al 0, and Al 2 had cytotoxic activities to autologous EBV-BL cells expressing peptide C9 or Cl 1 de-In order to identify the minimal antigenic peptide for these T cell clones, a nested set of truncated peptides within the relevant region of C6, C9 or C 1 1 determinant were prepared and tested, in both proliferation and 5'Cr release assays. Peptides C6B (residues 119-145), C6C (residues 124-l 45) and C6E (residues 125-139) were equally efficient in proliferation assays, as compared to the antigenic 34-mer peptide C6 (C6A, residues 1 19-l 52). C6E (15 residues) is the shortest peptide that could stimulate T cell clones Rl 1 and R18 ( Table 2 ). The results obtained in cytotoxicity assays with T cell clones Rl 0, Rl 1 and R18 were found paralleled with the results in proliferation assays (data not shown). Thus these T cell clones displayed cytotoxic activities against autologous EBV-BL targets expressing epitopes C6C and C6E but not C6D, C6F or C6H. Besides the C9 peptide (C9A, residues 205-233), only the truncated peptide C9B (residues 205-2 16) stimulated the proliferative responses of T cell clones A2 and Al 1 (Table 2) . Peptides C9C (residues 210-221), C9D (residues 212-223) C9E (residues 222-233) and C9F (residues 216-227) gave negative results (Table 2) . Cytotoxic responses of A2 and Al 1 clones to truncated C9 peptides were found similar to the proliferation responses (data not shown). T cell clones Al 0 and Al 2 responded to all Cl 1 peptides, the antigenic 26- and Cl 1 F (residues 264-272) in proliferation assays (Table 2) . Cl 1 F is the shortest Cl 1 -truncated peptide that stimulated the T cell clones with significant cell proliferation responses (Table 2 ). In 5'Cr release assays, T cell clones Al 0 and Al 2 were cytotoxic against autologous EBV-BL target cells expressingpeptidescll (CllA), CllB,CllC,andCllE, but not Cl 1 D and Cl 1 F (data not shown). These results suggest that there is some difference in the T cell recognition of Cl 1 epitope between two T cell functional assays. It appears that the induction of cytotoxic responses of these T cell clones to C 1 1 -binding targets requires residues TTER of Cl 1 sequence. We are interested in determining whether these T cell clones were restricted through different HLA determinants. mAbs specific to monomorphic regions of the HLA-A.B.C., HLA-DR, and HLA-DQ antigens were a A total of 2 X 1 O4 T cell from each clone were tested for their proliferative response to each synthetrc peptide at a final concentration of 1 pg/ml in the presence of APC (6000-rad r-irradiated autologous EBV-BC cell).",

The most important difference between EBV-BL DO and 6 other EBV-BLs is that the former shares the HLA DRw9 phenotype with RM (Table 3) . Similar results were observed in 5'Cr release assays. Five EBV-BLs were used as target cells. These T cell clones recognized only RM and DO targets but not HE, MS, and AT targets (data not shown).

The HLA restriction patterns of T cell clones Al 0 and Al 2 are more complex than those of the clones mentioned above. Besides six EBV-BLs of HLA-DR4 phenotype, EBV-BL LM of DRl phenotype could also present peptide Cl 1 to stimulated clones Al 0 and Al 2 in proliferation responses (data not shown). Similar genetic restriction by HLA DR4 was shown in cytotoxicity assays (Fig. 2) . Interestingly, T cell clone Al 2 was cytotoxic against targets /u, AT, MT (DR4 phenotype), and LM (DRl phenotype), which presented Cl 1 determinants (Fig. 2B) . These results suggest that there is some cross-recognition by T cell clones between DRl and DR4 subtypes. This phenomenon is consistent with reports regarding HLA restriction of human T cell clones (Rees et a/., 1989; Lamb et al., 1988) . However, in contrast to this, T cell clone Al 2 exhibited specific cytotoxic responses against HCL PRIESS (DR4 pheno-type), which expressed Cl 1, but not against HCL MAJA of the HLA-DRl phenotype ( Fig. 2A) . There may be differences in the structure of the antigen-binding site between the DRl molecules of HCL MAJA and EBV-BL LM. Three different DRl subtypes that have amino acid substitution in the putative peptide-binding site (residues 52-86 of p domain) have been identified (Marsh and Bodmer, 1989 ). These differences between DRl subtypes may result in DR4-restricted Cl 1 peptide not binding with sufficient affinity or in the required conformation of the DRl molecule of HCL MAJA to stimulate the T cell clone. There is no cross-recognition by T cell clones A2 and Al 1 between DRl and DR4 subtypes. Similar results have been reported in the study of human T cell recognition of influenza virus (Brett et al., 1991) .",

Due to the limits imposed on T cell antigen recognition by MHC restriction, it is becoming apparent that a number of T cell sites will be required to ensure that a synthetic vaccine will engage the majority of an outbred population. Presentation of a number of short synthetic T cell sites within a particular structure may be an economical and feasible way to accomplish this task (Milich, 1988) . The recognitions of C9 and Cl 1 by T cell clones were associated with DR4, which was the most frequently occurring HLA DR allele among orientals (22%) and is also common among Caucasians (13%). Furthermore, HLA-DRw9 is also frequent among orientals (12%) (Giles and Capra, 1985 ). Recently we have tested 20 T cell lines from 10 RV patients and 10 healthy donors with different HLA phenotypes by using 11 synthetic C peptides. Our results demonstrate that Cl 1, C6, and C9 are recognized by these T cell lines at a higher frequency than other peptides (unpublished data). These T cell determinants may be selected as the candidates for T cell sites for future RV vaccine development.",
