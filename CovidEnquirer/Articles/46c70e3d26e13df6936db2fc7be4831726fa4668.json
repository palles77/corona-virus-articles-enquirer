Two hundred and forty scouring lambs, and 25 healthy lambs selected as control, were used in this trial. The faecal samples from the scouring lambs were positive to non-enterotoxigenic E. coli. All the scouring lambs received supportive care and they were randomly allotted to two groups of 120 animals (treated group and untreated group). The lambs in the treated group were given two daily doses of 20 mg/kg live weight spectinomycin for 3 days, while the other group of lambs (untreated group) did not receive any antibiotic. Serum endotoxin was higher in the treated lambs. The combined infection of E. coli + Proteus mirabilis was the most frequent microbiological result in the deceased treated lambs, while the only enteric pathogen isolated in the untreated lambs submitted to necroscopy was E. coli. The pathological findings most commonly recorded in the untreated lambs were suggestive of a generalized inflammatory process attributed to colibacilosis, while the lesions in the treated lambs might correspond to an enterotoxoemic process. The overproduction of P. mirabilis might be consequence of the antibiotic treatment and it would be the most probable cause of the endotoxemia, the high mortality rate and the pathological findings in the treated lambs. Therefore, a supportive care without antibiotics does not lead to a poorer chance of survival in lambs with diarrhoea attributed to non-enterotoxigenic E. coli.",

The combined infection of E. coli + P. mirabilis had a higher incidence in the treated lambs (Table 2) , while the only enteric pathogen isolated in the untreated lambs was E. coli. This finding might be associated to the effect of the antibiotic treatment. Spectinomycin is a bacteriostatic antibiotic that inhibits protein synthesis in susceptible bacteria by binding to the 30S ribosomal unit (Plumb, 1995) . The efficacy of antibiotic treatment against E. coli (Hodgson et al., 1999) and the resistance of P. mirabilis against antibiotics in several circumstances (Dance et al., 1987) have been reported. This could indicate that the treatment with spectinomycin could have limited the growing of E. coli in the patients from the treated group and it would have permitted the overproduction of P. mirabilis. P. mirabilis is able to produce endotoxin that can impair diverse biological functions through several mechanisms, as the alteration of platelet activity (Saluk-Juszczak et al., 2007) . In the treated lambs the concentration of endotoxin in serum was significantly higher than in the untreated group (Table 1 ). This concentration was around 0.50 ng/mL, the point beyond survival chance is null ; while untreated lambs showed results below this limit. This could explain the significant difference in the mortality rate between the two groups (Table 1 ). It could support as well the pathological findings of the spectinomycin-treated lambs lost by diarrhoea.",
