A total of 328 T cell lines (TCLs) was established by seeding CSF cells at limiting dilution into histoplates in the presence of irradiated feeder cells and phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-containing conditioned medium. 80% of TCLs expressed the CD4+CD8 -, 5% the CD4-CD8 \u00f7 phenotype and 15% of TCLs contained different proportions of CD4 \u00f7 and CD8 \u00f7 cells. Of 191 TCLs analyzed, 85 were cytotoxic, as shown by their lectin-dependent cytotoxicity against allogeneic uninfected target cells. Eight of them demonstrated specificity for the autologous, rubella virus-infected target cells. When tested for antigen-specific proliferative activity, 26 TCLs responded to rubella antigen, 16 TCLs reacted to myelin basic protein (MBP), four TCLs to proteolipid protein (PLP), four to galactocerebrosides and two to actin. Fourteen out of 16 MBP-specific TCLs also responded, to a minor degree, to rubella antigen and/or actin. The results showed that the persisting rubella infection had given rise to autoreactive T cells. Virus-induced autoreactivity to brain antigens may be an important pathogenetic mechanism in other chronic inflammatory disorders of the CNS.",

This problem has been overcome by progress in modern tissue culture techniques and the use of interleukin-2 (IL-2) as a T cell growth factor. By using IL-2 it is now possible to expand and analyze functional T cell populations in the CSF. We have used this technique successfully in acute virus infections of the CNS such as mumps meningitis and measles encephalitis (Fleischer and Kreth, 1983a, b) . The results showed that a high proportion of CSF T cells were specific for the infecting virus. Virtually all cytotoxic T cells were found to be virus-specific and restricted by class I human leukocyte antigens (HLA).",

After a latent period of many years, patients present with a gradually deteriorating syndrome characterized by intellectual impairment, seizures, myoclonus, dementia, choreiform movements and cerebellar ataxia. Analysis of the CSF shows high levels of IgG with oligoclonal bands specific for rubella virus. The disease resembles subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) to some extent; there are, however, some distinct differences. For instance, a moderate lymphoid pleocytosis is frequently observed in patients with PRP. Rubella virus has been recovered from brain tissues, with and without co-cultivation techniques, and also from infected lymphocytes Wolinsky et al., 1979) . Viral antigens have, however, not been detected by immunofluorescence in brain sections using immunofluorescence, and the exact site and molecular biology of the persistent rubella virus is unknown.",

Obviously, the virus-specific cells may be missed easily if only a small sample of the CSF T cell clones is analyzed. This was the reason why we expanded all the T cell colonies, including those found in wells which had originally been seeded with up to 30 CSF lymphocytes (the majority of TCLs tested are therefore oligoclonal cell populations). Secondly, there was a complete lack of virus-specific CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). A small fraction of TCLs did exhibit the typical properties of CTL as far as virus specificity and restriction to self antigens is concerned, but all lines, with the exception of line 289 which lacked both CD8 and CD4 surface markers, were of the CD4 + phenotype.

It is, however, statistically unlikely that lack of clonality in the TCLs would account for the observed high frequency of double and treble specificities.",

This has been interpreted as a result of a diffuse inflammatory process. It could well be that the extent of tissue destruction is not only due to the presence of immune complexes and/or virus-specific T cells but that destruction of white matter is enhanced by the presence of autosensitized MBP-specific T cells.",
