Multiple pathogens affect mitochondria dynamics and functions to influence their intracellular survival or evade host immunity. On the other side, major host responses elicited against infections are directly dependent on mitochondrial functions, thus placing mitochondria centrally in maintaining homeostasis upon infection. In this review, we summarize how different bacteria and viruses impact morphological and functional changes in host mitochondria and how this manipulation can influence microbial pathogenesis as well as the host cell metabolism and immune responses.",

            "text": "Mitochondrial networks are dynamic in nature, undergoing cycles of fission and fusion that are mediated by a dedicated set of dynamin-related GTPases. Mitofusin 1 and 2 (MFN1 and MFN2) and optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) coordinate their functions to bring about mitochondrial fusion. Mitochondrial fusion essentially involves fusion of the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). MFN1 and MFN2, which are OMM proteins, interact with each other in a homo-and heterotypic manner involving GTP hydrolysis, which eventually leads to the fusion of the OMM. Fusion of the IMM is mediated by OPA1, which is a GTPaseprotein anchored in the IMM. OPA1 is proteolytically cleaved into different fragments, including a long (L) form and a short (S) form, in the intermembrane space (IMS) of the mitochondria by two membrane-bound metalloproteases OMA1 and YME1L. L-OPA1 has been associated with mitochondrial fusion [2, 3] . Loss of these mitochondrial fusion-mediating proteins (MFN1, MFN2, and OPA1) leads to mitochondrial fragmentation [4, 5] . Mitochondrial fusion is an essential cellular process that helps to merge fragments of mitochondria, mediating the exchange of mtDNA, proteins, and metabolites [6] . Mitochondria can also break their network down into smaller fragments in a process termed 'mitochondrial fission'. The most critical factor regulating this process is the cytosolic GTPase-protein dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), also called dynamin-1-like protein (DNM1L). Under conditions of mitochondrial fragmentation, DRP1 is recruited from the cytosol to the OMM, where it forms oligomeric structures wrapping around the mitochondrial scission site and, eventually through GTP hydrolysis, undergoes a conformational change that results in membrane constriction and scission [7] . On the OMM, DRP1 interacts with mitochondrial fission factor (MFF) and mitochondrial dynamics proteins (MiD49 and MiD51), which serve as receptors for its recruitment [8, 9] . Consistent with their role in mitochondrial fission, loss of MFF, MiD49, and MiD50 leads to mitochondrial hyperfusion and defected DRP1 recruitment to the mitochondria [10] [11] [12] . There is no known regulator of IMM fission, and it is not understood how the IMM and OMM coordinate in the process of fission.",

Mitochondrial fission also has a critical role in replicating mitochondria during cell cycle. There are also specific sites on mitochondria that serve as designated sites for mitochondrial fission. These sites are often where the tubules of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) physically contact mitochondria. These ER-mitochondria contact sites induce a constriction, where DRP1 is eventually recruited [13] . Furthermore, the receptors of DRP1, MiD49, and MiD51 are also present at the ER-mitochondria contact sites, suggesting that these sites are involved in the recruitment of DRP1 and subsequent mitochondrial fission [13, 14] . It is not clearly understood how much of mitochondrial fission is driven by ER and whether the role of ER in mediating mitochondrial fission depends on specific stimuli or if it is a general phenomenon under all conditions that promote mitochondrial fission.",

Historically, studying bacterial internalization and their intracellular life-cycles elucidated mechanistic details of endocytic trafficking and vesicular biology.

            "text": "Several bacteria have developed strategies to subvert mitochondrial dynamics to benefit their intracellular niche. An effective way of subverting the mitochondrial function can be beneficial for intracellular bacteria since mitochondria can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can be detrimental for the survival and proliferation of intracellular bacteria. A common theme among bacteria that target mitochondrial dynamics is that they form a niche to proliferate inside host cells. However, there are clear exceptions to this rule, as exemplified by Helicobacter pylori, an extracellular bacterium that targets mitochondria (discussed later). Moreover, most of the bacteria targeting mitochondrial morphology generally cause fragmentation of the mitochondria, thereby perturbing their function significantly. An interesting example is the intracellular Grampositive bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. Infection with L. monocytogenes leads to rapid mitochondrial fission, causing fragmentation of the mitochondrial network, with effects that are dependent on its pore-forming toxin listeriolysin O [15] . Perturbation of mitochondrial dynamics by knocking down components of the fusion (MFN1 and MFN2) and fission (DRP1) machineries impacts the intracellular survival of L. monocytogenes, suggesting that the bacterium actively deploys listeriolysin O to fragment mitochondria for its sustenance inside the cell [15] . Interestingly, mitochondrial fission caused by L. monocytogenes is independent of DRP1 [16] , pointing towards other mechanisms of mitochondrial fission that are as yet unknown. Similar to Listeria, H. pylori also targets mitochondria via its secreted vacuolating cytotoxin VacA, which localizes Trends in Cell Biology to mitochondria [17] . VacA induces fragmentation of the mitochondrial network and subsequent release of cytochrome C, which are both dependent on the activity of DRP1 [18] . DRP1-dependent mitochondrial fragmentation is also observed in Shigella flexneri infections [19] . Knockdown of the DRP1 gene by small interfering (si)RNA reverses mitochondrial fragmentation, and reduces the infectious foci counts and the plaque size, suggesting a decrease in cell-to-cell spreading of bacteria [19] . Furthermore, Legionella pneumophila secretes an effector called MitF through its type IV secretion system, which induces DRP1-dependent mitochondrial fragmentation in macrophages [20] . Blocking mitochondrial fragmentation leads to a decrease in intracellular replication of L. pneumophila [20] . By contrast, Chlamydia trachomatis preserves the elongated mitochondrial network for its intracellular proliferation. C. trachomatis upregulates a host miRNA (miR-30c-5p), which is key in maintaining the mitochondrial structure and intracellular proliferation of the bacteria [21] . While during the early infection phase, C. trachomatis induces mitochondrial elongation, it does resort to enhancing mitochondrial fragmentation during the late phases of infection [22] . Mitochondrial elongation is associated with enhanced respiratory activity and increased ATP production, which in turn promotes bacterial proliferation, thus making mitochondria a critical focal point in the intracellular life-cycle of C. trachomatis [22] (Figure 1 ).",

By contrast, dengue viruses inhibit DRP1, thus inducing mitochondrial fusion and elongation of the mitochondrial network via a nonstructural protein NS4B. Mitochondrial fusion is required for intracellular proliferation of the virus and evasion of the antiviral innate immune signaling [25, 26] . Moreover, ORF-9b, a virulence factor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), induces proteasomal degradation of DRP1, thereby leading to mitochondrial fusion, which eventually limits host cell interferon (IFN) responses against the virus [27] . Similarly, the HIV envelope protein gp120 causes a reduction in DRP1 levels, leading to mitochondrial hyperfusion [28] . These studies and other research [29] have clearly established a role of mitochondrial dynamics and their interplay with antiviral immunity upon a viral invasion.

Human alveolar macrophages also display a similar shift towards aerobic glycolysis, which is essential to curb the intracellular growth of bacteria. Inhibition of this metabolic switch leads to reduced production of proinflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2 and enhanced growth of intracellular bacteria [31] . Similarly a switch towards aerobic glycolysis was also observed in a rabbit model of active tuberculosis (TB), in M. tuberculosis-infected lung granulomas of guinea pigs, and in lung granulomas from patients with TB [32] [33] [34] . M. tuberculosis also enhances the levels of aerobic glycolysis in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) dependent on Toll-Like Receptor 2 (TLR2) and the AKT-mTOR pathway [35] . Another Mycobacterium species, Mycobacterium avium, also induces aerobic glycolysis in infected cells, which is dependent on the presence of IFN-\u03b3 [36] . Additionally, Brucella abortus, an intracellular bacterium causing chronic human and live-stock disease, can alter host cell metabolism to benefit its own growth and proliferation in cells. The metabolic shift induced by B. abortus is characterized by reduced TCA metabolism, reduced amino acid consumption, altered mitochondrial localization, and augmented lactate production [37] . Chemical inhibition of glycolysis and lactate production attenuates the intracellular survival of B. abortus [37] . Furthermore, infection with C. trachomatis also rewires cellular metabolism. C. trachomatis infection causes upregulation of the glucose transporter Glut1 and downregulation of TIGAR, which is an inhibitor of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, thereby altering glycolysis [38] . These findings are in line with C. trachomatis being an obligate intracellular bacterium the growth of which depends on the uptake of glucose from the host cells [39] . Similarly, Chlamydia psittaci induces metabolic perturbations and alterations of mitochondrial function characterized by increased glutamate and lactate production and accumulation of glycogen due to higher consumption of glucose by infected cells [40] . Macrophages infected with L. pneumophila also exhibit an abrupt halt of mitochondrial respiration and an increase in glycolysis, thus tipping the balance towards aerobic respiration, which is required for intracellular bacterial replication [20] . Thus, it is now clear that bacteria influence host metabolism. It will be interesting to further explore what kind of effectors and molecular mechanisms bacteria use to hijack the mitochondrial metabolism. To obtain a complete picture, it will also be important to address the outstanding mechanistic questions as to how sensing of certain bacteria, such as M. tuberculosis, leads the host cell to remodel its cellular metabolism to restrict bacterial proliferation.",

Interestingly, viruses can induce different effects on the host metabolism, which specifically depend of the type of virus. For example, two related herpes viruses [human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1)] induce different effects on host metabolism. While HCMV enhances glycolytic flux, HSV-1 leads to induction of the TCA cycle [41] . HCMV appears to directly impact metabolism by elevating mitochondrial biogenesis, which is accompanied by increased respiration, both of which are required for HCMV replication [42] . Measles virus also enhances mitochondrial functions characterized by reduced ROS levels and enhanced mitochondrial membrane potential in infected cells, and this perturbation is required for persistent infection [43] . Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection enhances mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation [44] and, concordantly, pharmacological inhibition of the transport of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria restricts viral replication [45] . From numerous studies, it has become apparent that different viruses target different nodes of mitochondrial metabolism, including \u03b2-oxidation and the TCA cycle. However, we are still far from a clear understanding as to what the mechanisms of mitochondrial targeting are and why there exists such a diversity of metabolic perturbations caused by different viruses.",

            "text": "There are also several bacteria that inhibit cell death instead of promoting it. This is seen as a strategy to protect their niche inside the cells where they replicate. For example, L. pneumophila secretes an effector called SidF through its T4SS, which inhibits apoptosis by suppressing the effects of the Bcl2 family proapoptotic proteins BNIP3 and Bcl-rambo [52] . SdhA is another L. pneumophila T4SS effector, which prevents apoptosis of the infected macrophages. Macrophages infected with the L. pneumophila sdhA mutant display enhanced cell death, thereby hindering the intracellular proliferation of the bacteria [53] . Coxiella burnetii uses an effector, named CaeB, to limit MOMP, thereby inhibiting the intrinsic apoptosis pathway [54] . CaeB expression in HEK293 cells leads to its localization to mitochondria, suggesting that this effector manipulates mitochondrial physiology, which then modulates cell death [54] . Additionally, C. trachomatis and Chlamydia pneumoniae induce proteasomal degradation of the proapoptotic proteins Bim, Puma, and Bad without affecting the transcript levels [55, 56] . Degradation of these proteins eventually leads to suppression of cytochrome c release into the cytosol and inhibition of cell death, which assists the proliferation of the bacteria in the cells. A C. trachomatis effector called CPAF is responsible for inhibiting cell death by promoting the degradation of proapoptotic proteins [57] . While there are many different pathways that induce the demise of a cell, the mitochondrial pathway is widely targeted by bacteria to manipulate the host. It requires further investigation to understand whether there is crosstalk between cell death pathways when cells are challenged with a bacterial infection or whether bacteria also use similar effectors and mechanisms to target other forms of cell death. Bacterial modulation of the mitochondrial cell death pathway appears logical in terms of keeping the immune system silent, since it triggers apoptosis, which is an anti-inflammatory form of cell death (Figure 3 ).",

            "text": "Similar to bacteria, viruses can also modulate cell death for their own replication and dissemination. For example, Influenza A utilizes the mitochondrial cell death pathway by targeting its virulence factor PB1-F2 to the IMM space, where it disrupts mitochondrial organization, thereby inducing cell death [61] . Similarly, an HIV protein, called the viral protein R, translocates to OMM upon viral infection, inhibits Mfn2, and disrupts mitochondrial membrane potential, leading ultimately to cell death induction [62, 63] . Interestingly, in contrast to HIV and Influenza A, some viruses, including Dengue [64] , Zika [65] , and Chikungunya [66] viruses, promote autophagy in the host, which inhibits cell death and promotes viral replication and dissemination. Similarly, measles virus enhances mitophagy in host cells, which limits apoptosis, but induces necrotic cell death in the later stages due to reduced levels of ATP [67] . Studies of viral infections have highlighted the involvement of autophagy and its interplay in different forms of cell death. These interesting studies have also revealed how certain aspects of bacterial infections match viral strategies, while others differ, in the context of modulating cell death. including include Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer (Bak), regulate the mitochondrial cell death pathway. Bax and Bak are proapoptotic proteins that localize to mitochondria and induce outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MOMP), leading to the release of proapoptotic factors, such as cytochrome C, into the cytosol, which induce cell death by activating Caspases 9, 3, and 7 via the apoptosome complex. Bacteria and viruses influence this pathway and modulate the host response. Helicobacter, Shigella, and Mycobacterium infections lead to mitochondrial disruption that stimulates the mitochondrial apoptotic machinery and causes cell death. By contrast, bacteria such as Chlamydia and Legionella block the mitochondrial cell death pathway to promote their intracellular proliferation. Different viruses also exert varied effects on the mitochondrial cell death pathway. Influenza A enhances cell death, which helps in its dissemination, while Zika virus blocks cell death.

Innate immune receptors, also known as pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), are either cytosolic or membrane bound. The most-studied PRRs include the membrane bound TLRs and the cytosolic nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs). Ligand-activated TLRs or NLRs lead to the induction of downstream signaling cascades, causing the activation of major immune-regulatory transcription factors, such as AP-1 and NF-\u03baB, ultimately leading to the production of cytokines and chemokines.

Ten human (TLR1-10) and 12 mouse TLRs (TLR1-9, TLR11, 12, and 13) have been identified and characterized so far. In humans, TLR1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 10 are localized to the plasma membrane and TLRs 3, 7, 8, and 9 are localized intracellularly in the endosomal membrane. While TLRs are activated significantly by bacterial or viral components, several studies have highlighted the role of mitochondrial components in modulating TLR signaling. mtDNA is similar to bacterial DNA in that both share hypomethylated CpG motifs that activate TLR signaling. Purified human and murine mtDNA injected intra-articularly led to arthritis in mice, while this effect was not observed with nuclear DNA, revealing the inflammatory nature of mtDNA [68] . In addition to mitochondrial components being proinflammatory, mitochondria themselves regulate TLR signaling in response to MAMPs. Activation of TLRs 1, 2, and 4 leads to the recruitment of mitochondria to macrophage phagosome and enhances mitochondrial ROS production. After TLR activation, the TLR adaptor protein TRAF6 interacts with, and ubiquitinates, a mitochondrial respiratory chain assembly factor, ECSIT. Ubiquitination of ECSIT leads to enhanced mitochondrial ROS production, which augments intracellular bacterial killing [69] . ECSIT interacts with TRAF6 and the serine/threonine kinase TAK1 upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, which activates TLR4 signaling. These protein interactions are deemed necessary for NF-\u03baB activation upon LPS stimulation [70] . Activation of TLR signaling upon viral infections is also modulated by mitochondria. The OMM protein MARCH5 positively regulates TLR7 signaling by poly-ubiquitinating TANK (a TRAF-binding protein) and impairing its ability to bind to TRAF6 [71] . Additionally, the transcription factor NFAT1 is known to translocate into mitochondria in murine microglia with LPS stimulation, inhibition of which leads to reduced levels of cytokines and suppression in ROS production, suggesting a link with mitochondrial regulation of TLR signaling in microglia [72] . Bacterial infection also upregulates mitochondrial biogenesis through the upregulation of the PGC family of transcriptional co-activators [73] [74] [75] . This induction of mitochondrial biogenesis is also dependent on TLR2 and TLR4, signifying that the innate immune function feeds into the regulation of mitochondrial function [73] . Moreover, it was recently reported that methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) induces the generation of mitochondria-derived vesicles that contain ROS and that help in the clearance of intracellular bacteria dependent on TLR signaling [76] . Even though there is substantial evidence for the involvement of mitochondria in TLR signaling, there are significant gaps that need to be addressed, in particular how mitochondria sense activation of TLRs and how they play into regulating downstream signaling. It will also be of interest to determine whether different TLRs follow similar mechanisms of mitochondrial involvement and whether the loss of mitochondrial functionality completely dampens TLR responses phenotypically. Ongoing and future work will address these conundrums.",

Subsequently, the mitochondrial-associated adaptor protein MAVS was identified as an interaction partner important for the association of NLRP3 with mitochondria [81, 82] . MAVS also promoted NLRP3-induced production of mature IL-1\u03b2, revealing an important role of mitochondria in mediating NLRP3 function [81, 82] . Another mitochondrial protein, MAPL (also known as MUL1), localizes to the OMM and regulates NLRP3 activity. SUMOylation of NLRP3 by MAPL results in suppression of its activity [83] . Furthermore ,mtDNA [84, 85] and the mitochondrial lipid cardioliopin [86] act as potent activators of the NLRP3 inflammasome. By contrast, NLRP3 inducers also bring about aberrant perturbation of mitochondrial homeostasis by diminishing the concentration of NAD + , which consequently leads to accumulation of acetylated \u03b1-tubulin and subsequent microtubule remodeling, which is also necessary for NLRP3 localization to mitochondria [87] . Moreover, another member of the NLR family, NLRX1, interacts with MAVS in the OMM, and this interaction downregulates IFN-\u03b2 production upon viral infection [88] . Loss of NLRX1 promotes virus-induced type I IFN production and decreases viral replication [88] . Overactivation of NLRX1 causes enhanced ROS production [89] [90] [91] . NLRX1 has also been reported to target the mitochondrial matrix and interact with UQCRC2, a matrix protein of the respiratory chain complex III. This interaction is required for ROS production [90] . Besides ROS production, NLRX1 was recently shown to function as a mitophagy receptor in L. monocytogenes infection [92] . Additionally, activation of the NLRC4 inflammasome has been associated with mitochondrial damage. P. aeruginosa infection leads to increased production of ROS and release of mtDNA into the cytoplasm, which activates the NLRC4 inflammasome [93] . Thus, it will be interesting to determine how the less understood inflammasomes, such as NLRP6, NLRP7, and NLRP12, react upon mitochondrial perturbations and whether conditions that activate these inflammasomes also influence mitochondrial physiology.",

The mitochondrial protein MAVS influences the function of retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), which are specialized PRRs involved in the recognition of viruses by the innate immune system [94] . The RLR family members RIG-I, melanoma differentiationassociated 5 (MDA5), and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) sense viral RNA in the cytoplasm and lead to downstream activation of a potent immune response, which activates the transcription factors IRF3, IRF7, and NF-\u03baB, culminating in the production of type I IFNs and other proinflammatory cytokines. Viral infection induces aggregation of MAVS on the mitochondrial membrane, which is mediated by RIG-I, and these MAVS aggregates are capable of activating IRF3 to generate an antiviral immune response [95] . The mitochondrial fusion protein MFN2 also regulates RLR signaling via MAVS. MFN2 directly interacts with MAVS; overexpression of MFN2 leads to a decrease in RIG-I and MDA5, thereby reducing antiviral immunity [96] . Interestingly, MAVS is also located on peroxisomes, and peroxisomal and mitochondrial MAVS work in conjunction to promote IFN production and antiviral immunity [97, 98] .",

This pathway senses cytosolic DNA and generates a downstream immune response driving type I IFNs and other proinflammatory cytokines. mtDNA present in the cytosol is sensed by cGAS and the cGAS-STING pathway is turned on. mtDNA stress induced by a deficiency in the transcription factor TFAM, leads to an escape of mtDNA into the cytosol, where it engages the DNA sensor cGAS, promoting STING-IRF3 signaling and ultimately culminating in a type I IFN response [99] . Mechanistic studies on the regulation of cell death and inflammation governed by mitochondria revealed that the absence of proapoptotic caspases promotes the cells to induce the cGAS-STING pathway and antiviral immunity upon MOMP [100, 101] . Even though MOMP induced by Bax/Bak proteins has been associated with the escape of mtDNA into the cytoplasm [102] , the exact mechanism whereby mtDNA can escape to the cytosol remains unknown. Further investigations are needed to ascertain whether additional mechanisms exist that release mtDNA into the cytoplasm to induce cGAS-STING signaling.",

Similarly, extracellular bacteria have devised ways of targeting mitochondria to induce cell death to avail themselves with nutrients. Even viruses have dedicated virulence factors that modulate mitochondrial function to influence their replication and dissemination. Downstream of an infection, it is fascinating that a plethora of immune responses, be it against bacteria or viruses or LPS stimulation, are strongly impacted by mitochondria (see Outstanding Questions). Thus, it will be exciting to extrapolate this current understanding and delve into how these fundamental processes governed by mitochondria can be translated into active therapeutics to boost immunity against pathogens or to keep overt immune responses under control in the case of inflammatory disorders.",

            "text": "Modulation of Mitochondrial Metabolism upon Infection. Many bacteria and viruses hijack cellular metabolism for their own benefit. Mycobacterium is the best-known bacterium that influences host metabolism by enhancing aerobic glycolysis. Epithelial cells and immune cells infected with Mycobacterium exhibit a reduction in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and a corresponding increase in the glycolytic flux. Elevated aerobic glycolysis is also observed in Mycobacterium-infected lung granulomas in animal models of infection and in patients with active tuberculosis. Legionella also promotes glycolytic flux similar to Mycobacterium, thus enhancing aerobic glycolysis. Brucella infection promotes lactate production via aerobic glycolysis, while suppressing the TCA cycle. Chlamydia enhances the levels of the glucose transporter GLUT1, leading to augmented glucose uptake and increased glycolytic flux, which is necessary for its intracellular growth. Viruses also perturb metabolic pathways for their replication and subsequent dissemination. Herpes virus induces the TCA cycle, thereby promoting mitochondrial respiration, while Hepatitis C perturbs mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Created with BioRender (www.BioRender.com).",
