A viral diagnosis was established in 38 (39%) of the 98 patients, and a bacterial diagnosis in 19 (19%). Ten (53%) of the 19 patients with bacterial pneumonia had a concurrent viral infection. No clinical, laboratory, or radiographic findings that would reliably differentiate viral from bacterial infection were identified. This study suggests that bacterial pneumonia is more common in pediatric outpatients than previously reported, and that the clinical, laboratory, and radiographic findings in patients with bacterial infection may be indistinguishable from findings in patients with viral infection. (J PEDIATR 1987;111:194-200) Most children with pneumonia are managed as outpatients. 1 In contrast, most published information about pneumonia, particularly bacterial pneumonia, has been derived from hospitalized patients. This situation reflects the lack of simple, reliable methods for establishing a diagnosis of bacterial infection in the outpatient setting. The diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia in pediatric patients generally depends on isolation of the infecting organism from the blood. Blood cultures, however, have been reported to be positive in only 13% of patients with bacterial pneumonia documented by lung punctures. 2 Lung puncture, which provides sensitive and specific detection of bacterial pneumonia, is too invasive to be used in patients who are not severely ill.",

Urine specimens were tested for the presence of bacterial capsular polysaccharide using pneumococcal omniserum (Statens Seruminstitute, Copenhagen) and burro antiserum to Haemophilis influenzae type b (provided by Dr. John Robbins, Bethesda, Md.). Each specimen was concentrated 20-to 100-fold (depending on the volume of urine collected) by ethanol prec!pitation. 12 CIE was done in a continuous system with 3 \u2022 1 inch glass slides coated with 3 mL 1% agarose (electrophoresis grade, Sigma Diagnostics, St. Louis) in veronal buffet, pH 8.8. Wells 3 mm in diameter and 3 mm apart were filled with the appropriate sample, and the electrophoresis was run at a constant current of 6 mA per slide for 1 hour. The slides were examined for precipitin lines immediately and after immersion in saline solution overnight at 4 ~ C. To determine the reproducibility of the assay, pneumococcal polysaccharide in broth medium was serially diluted in control urine. An aliquot of the highest dilution at which antigen could be detected by CIE was further diluted 1:100 and then reconcentrated by ethanol precipitation. Refrigerated and frozen aliquots of the Original limiting dilution and the reconcentrated specimen were then run with different lots of agarose slides. Freezing or ethanol precipitation appeared to have no effect on the reproducibility of the method, but there was variation in the sensitivity of different lots of agarose slides. For this reason, urine specimens with sufficient volume for repeat concentration were tested twice for the presence of bacterial antigen. Ten (14%) of the 74 specimens retested had discordant results on the repeat CIE assay, including four that were positive only on the repeat assay. Because all control specimens were negative regardless of the lot of slides used, specimens in which bacterial antigen was detected by either of the two assays were considered positive.",

In previous studies of hospitalized patients, blood culture had a sensitivity of 0nly 13% compared with lung puncturC and 15% compared with antigen detection. ~6 McCarthy et al., 17 in a study of pneumonia in outp~ttients, detected bacterial infection in five (3%) of 156 patients on the basis of a positive blood culture. In our Study, three (3%) of the 98 patients had a positive blood culture, compared with 17 (17%) of 98 who had antigenuria. This information suggests that the true incidence of bacterial pneumoni~i in pediatric outpatients is higher than the incidence reported in studies in which the diagnosis is based on blood cultures. The incidence of bacterial infection in this study must be interpreted with caution, however. Patients were not enrolled until a chest radiograph had been found to be positive. Furthermore, no attempt was made to enroll all patients who were eligible for the study. These factors could have introduced a bias toward enrolling the patients who were more ill. The fact that the hospitalization rate (21%) was similar to the rate (15%) reported in a previous field study of respiratory disease in pediatric patients ~ suggests that this bias did not have a major effect. The possibility that bacterial infec-tions were present but not detected by CIE must also be considered when evaluating these data.

The specificity of the antigen detection assay used in this study Was documented by the absence of antigenuria in 32 healthy children and 19 patients with otitis media. The detection of antigen in urine by CIE has also been found to be specific when used for the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia in adults; 4, 7 pneumococcal antigen was not detected in the urine of healthy controls or patients infected with other pathogens. The absence of bacterial antigenuria in control subjects suggests that simpl e coionization o1\" the upper respiratory tract does not produce detectable antigen in the urine. A recent study has reported the use of latex particle agglutination and staphylococcal coagglutination for detection of bacterial antigens in pediatric outpatients with lower respiratory tract infection. Is Although only 7% of the patients in the Study had radiographic evidence of pneumonia, 24% had bacterial antigenuria. Antigen was also detected in 16% of patients Mth otitis media and in 4% of healthy controls, however, suggesting that these methods may be less useful than CIE in the setting of lower respiratory tract disease.",

Five studies in which the diagnosis of bacterial infection was established by reliable methods reported concurrent viral infection in 25% to 75% of patients with bacterial pneumonia. 16.19-22 The finding that concurrent infection occurs with equal frequency in both inpatients and outpatients indicates that concurrent viral and bacterial infection is not associated with unusually severe disease, a suggestion that is further supported by the clinical findings in our Study. The high proportion of patients with bacterial pneumonia who have concurrent viral and bacterial infection is consistent with the speculation that viral infections may be important in the pathogenesis of bacterial pneumonia.",

            "text": "No specific clinical or laboratory findings were identi-fled in this study that would reliably differentiate patients with bacterial infection from patients with nonbacterial pneumonia. McCarthy et al. 17 have reported that positive CRP was significantly associated with bacteremia in patients with pneumonia. Although different methods were used for the CRP determination in the two studies, the most likely explanation for the different finding is that most of the patients with bacterial pneumonia in our study did not have detectable bacteremia and were relatively mildly ill. The observation that viral and bacterial pneumonia could not be differentiated by radiographic findings is consistent with previous reports. 23'~4 That many of the patients with viral infection had clinical, laboratory, and radiographic findings usually considered characteristic of bacterial pneumonia may simply reflect insensitivity in the detection of bacterial infection. Of greater interest was the finding that many of the patients with documented bacterial infection did not have these characteristics. It is possible that statistically significant differences would have been found between patients with viral and bacterial pneumonia if larger numbers of patients had been evaluated. The broad spectrum of illness in the patients with bacterial infection suggests, however, that the accurate detection of bacterial pneumonia in individual patients will be difficult. This information indicates that decisions about the use of antibiotics in patients with pneumonia cannot be based on the results of specific clinical, laboratory, or x-ray findings but should depend on the overall assessment of the patient. 25 ' 26 These data demonstrate that detection of bacterial antigen in the urine of Patients with pneumonia is a useful tool for the study of the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of this disease. Antigen detection has limited usefulness in the management of pediatric outpatients With uncomplicated pneumonia, because the majority of these patients respond to inexpensive and nontoxic antibiotic therapy and a precise etiologic diagnosis is not necessary for appropriate care.",
