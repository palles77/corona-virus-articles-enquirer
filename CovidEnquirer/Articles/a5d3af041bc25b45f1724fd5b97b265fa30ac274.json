            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus, is a causative agent of porcine enteric disease characterized by acute watery diarrhea and dehydration in sucking piglet. Similar to other coronaviruses, PEDV spike protein mediates its cell entry by binding to cellular receptors and inducing membrane fusion between viral envelopes and cellular membranes. However, the entry mechanism of PEDV is not studied. Here, we determined the entry mechanism of PEDV into Vero cells. Our data confirmed that PEDV entry followed clathrin-mediated endocytosis independence of caveolae-coated pit assembly. The internalized PEDV was co-localized with the clathrin-mediated endocytic marker, but not with the caveolae-mediated endocytic marker. In addition, cells treated with lysosomotropic agents and serine protease inhibitors were resistant to PEDV. Our data revealed that PEDV entry followed clathrinmediated endocytosis and was dependent on a low pH and serine proteolysis for successful entry into cells.",

            "text": "Infection of enveloped viruses is initiated by binding of surface proteins with specific receptor(s) on the surface of the cell membrane, which leads to internalization of the virus into cells. The second step of infection following virus attachment is the uncoating of the viral genome into the cytoplasm after the viral envelope has fused with the host membrane. There are two major routes for enveloped viruses to enter host cells; the non-endosomal and the endosomal pathways (Pelkmans and Helenius, 2003; Smith and Helenius, 2004) . Both pathways require the release of the viral genome by fusion of the viral envelope with the respective target membrane of the host cells such as the plasma or endosomal membrane, respectively (Matlin et al., 1981) . In the non-endosomal pathway, the viral envelope directly fuses with the plasma membrane. Membrane fusion is mediated by a conformational change of the viral glycoprotein, which is induced by its interaction with the corresponding receptor on the host cell surface and/or proteolytic processing (Blumenthal et al., 2002) . The endocytic pathway can further differentiate into two well-characterized pathways; those acting via the clathrin-coated pit and the caveolae-mediated lipid raft (Brodsky et al., 2001; Pelkmans and Helenius, 2002) . After internalization, viruses require a low-pH environment in the endosome to trigger conformational changes in the viral glycoproteins. The acidic pH environment is also important for proteolytic activation of viral glycoproteins by endosomal proteases (Qiu et al., 2006; Simmons et al., 2005) .",

            "text": "The porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is classified as Alphacoronavirus together with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), and human coronavirus 229E (hCoV-229E). PEDV causes an acute watery diarrhea in suckling piglets, which results in approximately 50% mortality among suckling piglets and reduces the weight among fattening pigs (Debouck and Pensaert, 1980) . Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is first recognized in pigs in the United Kingdoms in 1971 (Wood, 1977) . Although no evidence of PED is currently reported from Canada, similar coronavirus-like particles were reported from herds in Quebec in 1980 (Turgeon et al., 1980) . Since then, outbreaks of PED have been documented in many European and Asian countries such as Czech Republic, Hungary, Korea, the Philippines, China, Italy, Thailand, Germany, Spain, and Japan (Song and Park, 2012) . Recently, PEDV is spreading rapidly in swine farms in the United States, resulting in high mortality in piglets in more than 17 states (Mole, 2013 As typical for the Alphacoronavirus, the PEDV spike (S) protein encounters virus entry into host cells by interacting with its receptor, porcine aminopeptidase N (APN), in porcine enterocytes and by mediating membrane fusion with host cell membranes (Li et al., 2007; Oh et al., 2003) . Upon receptor binding, several coronaviruses in Alphacoronavirus enter cells via endocytosis. For example, extensive studies on hCoV-229E have shown that upon binding with the human APN receptor, it is taken up in lipid rafts and enters via caveolae-dependent endocytosis (Nomura et al., 2004) . Inside the endosome, cellular proteases that are active in a low-pH environment facilitate membrane fusion (Kawase et al., 2009) . Similarly, TGEV binds to porcine APN (Weingartl and Derbyshire, 1994) , and has been shown to enter MDCK cells over-expressing porcine APN via endocytosis and acidification of the intracellular compartment facilitated membrane fusion (Hansen et al., 1998) . FIPV also requires acidification of endosomes for successful entry (Takano et al., 2008) . Inhibition of FIPV infection with nystatin, a pharmacological reagent that causes caveolae to flatten and disrupt the coat structure, and dynamin 2 inhibitor suggests that FIPV entry might actually involve some types of caveolae-dependent endocytosis (Van Hamme et al., 2008) .",

In this study, we studied the entry mechanism of PEDV by measuring virus infectivity in the presence of chemical inhibitors and co-localization of PEDV with endocytic pathway markers. We found that PEDV infection was diminished by treatment with chloropromazine (CPZ) and lysosomotropic agents. In addition, we also investigated that PEDV required serine-like proteases for their entry through endocytosis and for cell-cell fusion. Taken together, our findings reveal that PEDV enters Vero cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and requires serine proteolysis during infection.",

As shown in Fig. 1 , we found that PEDV could infect Vero cells even without trypsin treatment. Initial infection was confirmed as early as 8 hpi on both trypsin and non-trypsin conditions. The number of infected cells in both conditions was similar but the spreading into adjacent cells was faster in the presence of trypsin. At 24 hpi, more than 95% of the cell monolayer had formed large multi-nucleated cells. In sharp contrast, PEDV growth without exogenous trypsin did not involve syncytial spread. At 48 hpi, more than 99% of the cells showed signs of infection, but still no cytopathic effect (CPE) was found. These results confirm that trypsin catalyzes PEDV S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion as demonstrated previously (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988; Park et al., 2011) . Based on these observations, we concluded that an exogenous protease, like trypsin, was necessary to induce cell-cell fusion in PEDV-infected Vero cells but not essentially required for virus-cell entry. So, we hypothesized that PEDV entry into Vero cells under the trypsin-free condition most likely occurred inside endosomal compartments where cellular proteases might operate similar to trypsin, facilitating S-mediated fusion of PEDV with the endosomal membrane.",

To explore whether the endocytic pathway supports PEDV entry into Vero cells and which endocytic pathway alters for PEDV infection, we inhibited pathway by using substances interfering either clathrin-mediated endocytosis or caveolae-mediated endocytosis. For the inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, we used either (i) CPZ, which is known to abolish the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles by interfering with the interaction of the adapter protein AP-2 with the clathrin-coated pit lattice and thus inhibiting clathrindependent endocytosis or (ii) hypertonic 0.45% sucrose, which inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis by inducing dispersion of clathrin lattices on the plasma membrane. For the inhibition of caveolae-mediated endocytosis, we used nystatin, a polyene antifungal agent that interacts with cholesterol and inhibits the lipid raft/caveolin pathway.

In contrast, E-64, pepstatin A, and phosphoramidon showed relatively lower inhibition with about 5-10% inhibition. These results suggested that serine proteases were importantly involved in PEDV entry into Vero cells.",

Both approaches provided similar conclusions on the mechanism of PEDV cell entry. The infection inhibition assay using various substrates that interfere with endocytosis or lysosomotropic agents revealed that PEDV enters Vero cells via clathrin-mediated endocytic uptake and delivery of virus to an acidic intracellular compartment. More interestingly, we found that PEDV requires serine proteolytic processes in early stages of infection.

            "text": "PEDV infection in vitro is also largely dependent on trypsin supplement (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988; Park et al., 2011) . It raises possibility that PEDV S could fuse with plasma membrane by activation with proteases to deliver their genomes into cells. However, our study demonstrated that PEDV entry occurs without exogenous proteases. Although PEDV infection was likely facilitated by trypsin treatment as demonstrated earlier, PEDV also propagated even without trypsin (Fig. 1) . Based on our results, we could confirm that exogenous protease, especially trypsin, might be critical factor for cell-cell fusion but not for viral envelope-cell membrane fusion. And also, we could conclude that trypsin is not essentially required for virus entry into Vero cells. Our results encouraged us to hypothesize that PEDV penetration must have been facilitated by fusion of its envelope with the host membrane in a fusion-permissive environment, which most likely occurs inside endosomal compartments. PEDV might take endosomal entry pathway rather than direct fusion. The experiment using various inhibitors supported our hypothesis that PEDV alters endosomal pathway for their entry. PEDV infection was greatly diminished by pre-treatment with CPZ and hypotonic sucrose (Fig. 2) . It suggests that PEDV enters Vero cells via clathrin-mediated pathway. Furthermore, co-localization between endocytosed Tf and fluorochrome-labeled PEDV may support conclusion that clathrin mediated endocytic uptake is major pathway for entry (Fig. 4) . Our data collectively propose that PEDV enters Vero cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis similar to other coronaviruses. Vero cells were treated with lysosomotropic agents, either NH4Cl or Baf-A1, and then infected with KPEDV-9. PEDV entry was scored by immunocytochemistry at 10 hpi. The relative infectivity was showed as percentages of infected cells to untreated cells. The error bars represent standard deviations of the mean values. (B) Low pH does not convert the PEDV S protein to its fusogenic form. PEDV infected Vero cells were exposed to various pH conditions, and then incubated in serum-free media for 4 h. Low to neutral pH range (pH 3-7) did not induce cell-cell fusion of PEDV-infected Vero cells. In contrast, the addition of trypsin at neutral pH readily induced cell-cell fusion within 4 h after treatment (lower right). In order to mediate membrane fusion enveloped viruses, such as influenza and dengue, the low pH of acidified endosomal compartments is sufficient for their conformational changes (Plemper, 2011) . Unlike these viruses, pH-dependent endosomal cellular factors were required for activation of low pH-dependent proteases, rather than the virus requiring an acidic trigger itself (Huang et al., 2006; Simmons et al., 2005) . Similar to other coronaviruses, PEDV infection was significantly inhibited by both NH 4 Cl and Baf-A1 (Fig. 5A ), but acidic pH did not induce PEDV S-mediated fusion (Fig. 5B) , suggesting that low pH did not differently mediate virus fusion and another triggering factors such as proteolytic activation might be required for successful fusion.",

PEDV entry into Vero cells was specifically inhibited by serine proteases inhibitor, but not by other proteases (Fig. 6A ). It suggests that serine or serine-like proteases in the cytoplasm are involved in facilitating the fusion between PEDV envelope and host endosomal membrane. It is not clear which serine proteases are involved in PEDV entry, however, we are assuming that intracellular serine proteases may cleave the S protein so that induce membrane fusion during infection. As shown in Fig. 6B , inhibitory effect of serine proteases inhibitors was observed when the lysosomotropic reagents were treated, indicating that novel serine protease(s) is involved in PEDV entry with acidic pH independent manner unlike low pH-dependent endosomal cathepsins. In addition, our finding that trypsin treatment is not bypass the infection inhibition with lysosomotropic agents and CPZ as shown in Fig. 7 , clearly indicates that PEDV entry requires pH-dependent step rather than the presence of pH-dependent proteolytic processing.

It seems like coronavirus S-mediated cell-cell fusion is regulated by different manner from virus-cell fusion. Acidic pH and serine proteolysis are sufficient for virus-cell fusion, in contrast, serine proteolysis and/or unknown other factor(s) which may provide similar condition to low pH, are required for cell-cell fusion at plasma membranes; thus S induces membrane fusion without low pH.",

The internalized PEDV was co-localized with the clathrin-mediated endocytic marker, but not with the caveolaemediated endocytic marker. In addition, cells treated with lysosomotropic agents and serine protease inhibitors were resistant to PEDV. Our data revealed that PEDV entry followed clathrin-mediated endocytosis and was dependent on an acidic pH and serine proteolysis for successful entry into cells.",
