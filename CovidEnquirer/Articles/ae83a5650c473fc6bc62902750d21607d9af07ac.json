Crowding conditions lead to high rates of respiratory infections among the pilgrims, representing a significant cause of morbidity and a major cause of hospitalization. Pre-and post-Hajj nasal specimens were prospectively obtained from a paired cohort (692 pilgrims) and from nonpaired cohorts (514 arriving and 470 departing pilgrims) from 13 countries. The countries of residence included Africa (44.2%), Asia (40.2%), the United States (8.4%) and Europe (7.2%). Nasal specimens were tested for 34 respiratory pathogens using RT-PCR. A total of 80 512 PCRs were performed. The prevalence of viruses and bacteria increased, from 7.4% and 15.4% before the Hajj to 45.4% and 31.0% after the Hajj, respectively, due to the acquisition of rhinovirus, coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, OC43), influenza A H1N1, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus. We did not identify Middle East respiratory coronavirus carriage. At arrival, the prevalence of several viruses was clearly dependent on the pilgrim's country of origin. After Hajj participation, these viruses were isolated among pilgrims from all countries, with few exceptions. No significant differences were observed between paired and nonpaired cohort results. Our results strongly suggest that, given the particularly crowded conditions during the rituals, an international mass gathering such as the Hajj may contribute to the globalization of respiratory pathogens after the cross-contamination of pilgrims harbouring pathogens that easily spread among participants. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccination, face mask use and hand hygiene should be considered in the context of the Hajj.",

The number of pilgrims undertaking the Hajj has increased by a factor 5 from 1920 to 2012 [1] . One of the major public health concerns in relation to mass gatherings is the importation or exportation of infectious diseases, spread between attendees and the local population and further spread to home countries through the returning participants [2] . The crowding conditions within a confined area during the Hajj leads to high rates of upper and lower respiratory infections among the pilgrims, which represent a significant cause of morbidity and a major cause of hospitalization [3] . Recent studies conducted among French pilgrims showed rapid acquisition of respiratory viruses and bacteria carriage, particularly rhinovirus and Streptococcus pneumoniae [4] [5] [6] [7] . In the present report, we investigate the nasal carriage of a large panel of 34 respiratory pathogens among pilgrims arriving in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) from 13 countries on four continents and among pilgrims departing from KSA after participating in the Hajj. The aim of the study was to identify changes in colonization before and after the pilgrimage and to investigate circulation and potential for globalization of these pathogens using two distinct cohort survey designs based on previous works [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] .",

The selection of the country of residence was based on representative countries from each continent and the availability of nationalities during the sampling dates. Potential adult participants were asked to participate in the study on a voluntary basis. Three groups of pilgrims were investigated. One group was included in a paired cohort survey in which the same pilgrims were evaluated before and after participating in the Hajj. The two other groups were included in a nonpaired cohort survey: one group consisted of pilgrims recruited before the Hajj, and the other consisted of different pilgrims of the same nationalities recruited after the Hajj.",

The specimens were transported on dry ice to France for analysis. Each swab was processed manually. One milliliter of medium was pipetted automatically (Beckman NX automate) to prepare 96-well microplates for total (DNA + RNA) nucleic acid extraction and long-term storage. To avoid unnecessary testing, a dual aliquot was prepared from 100 \u03bcL of nasal swab origin. The total nucleic acids were then purified using the Macherey-Nagel Nucleospin-96 kit.

The first pattern was characterized by the introduction into KSA of pathogens isolated at low rates among pilgrims arriving specifically from one or two countries ( Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S2 ). Some of these pathogens then spread to pilgrims from a large number of countries, with a slight increase in overall prevalence. This was particularly obvious for A/H1N1, which was found in two Indonesians only upon arrival but spread to 25 pilgrims from Africa, Central Asia and Southeast Asia after the Hajj. A survey conducted in a separate and larger paired cohort of French pilgrims at the same period also showed the acquisition of A/ H1N1 after the Hajj, whereas the pilgrims sampled before leaving France were negative [7] . This indicates that the acquisition resulted not only from human-to-human transmission through close contact within each group of pilgrims from the same country but was also acquired from other pilgrims, given the extremely high crowding density to which individuals from many parts of the world are exposed when performing Hajj rituals. Contamination originating from an environmental source may also have played a role.",

FLUA/H3N2, HCoVs, HEV and HRSV showed comparable patterns of transmission, but their geographical spread and/or prevalence were lower.

This group included FLUB, HAdV, HPeV N. meningitidis and C. burnetii.

The included population represented only a small percentage of the total number of pilgrims attending the 2013 Hajj; hence, the results cannot be extrapolated to the entire pilgrim population. The number of pilgrims from Europe and the United States was limited, and no pilgrims from the Middle East were included. In addition, data on chronic health conditions, preventive measures and symptoms during the Hajj were difficult to obtain and were available only for a limited number of subjects. Nevertheless, our study investigated a much larger and geographically more diverse cohort than previous studies [4] [5] [6] [7] . Overall, these results strongly suggest that, given the particularly crowded conditions during the rituals, an international mass gathering such as the Hajj may contribute to the globalization of common respiratory pathogens after the cross-contamination of pilgrims harbouring pathogens that easily spread among participants [25] .",
