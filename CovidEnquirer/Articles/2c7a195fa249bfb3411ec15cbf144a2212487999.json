            "text": "Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is one of the most common genetic diseases in cats. It has been widely described in Persians and Persian-related cats and sporadically in other breeds. The purpose of the present paper is to describe the first reported case of PKD in a 12-year-old female Chartreux cat. The cat was referred with polyuria and polydipsia and enlarged and irregular kidneys at palpation. Multiple renal cysts and a single liver cyst were identified by ultrasound and the inherited pattern was confirmed by genetic test (polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR/RFLP) assay). Chartreux cats should be included in the screening programme of PKD, and PKD should be always considered as a possible cause of chronic renal failure in this breed. A utosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (AD-PKD) is the one of the most prevalent inherited genetic disease in cats affecting 36e49.5% of Persians and Persians related cats such as Exotic Shorthairs and mix-breeds. 1e6 The disease is characterised by renal and less frequently hepatic and rarely pancreatic cysts, 7 that can be easily detected by ultrasound screening. A genetic mutation was identified in the PKD1 gene which was linked to AD-PKD. Two types of genetic tests are currently available (RFLP and real-time PCR). 8, 9 The prevalence of the disease in other breeds is less known. It has been reported sporadically in Burmillas, domestic shorthairs, Himalayans, American Shorthairs, Scottish Folds, British Shorthairs and Ragdolls. 1, 10, 11 The purpose of this paper is to describe the first reported case (to the author's knowledge) of PKD in an adult Chartreux cat.",

Cysts form from renal tubular cells and eventually separate from the nephron as they develop. As cysts enlarge, they compress surrounding normal renal parenchyma and lesions of chronic interstitial nephritis occur. As the disease advances, cysts increase in size, and renal volume increases. For these reasons, PKD is considered a progressive disease, and the prognosis is guarded. 1, 12, 13 The cat of the present report had clinical evidence of renal disease such as polyuria and polydipsia, with moderate azotaemia at the age of 12, managed successfully with conventional medical approach. Enalapril was inadequate to control high systemic blood pressure, which was subsequently stabilised with amlodipine. Amlodipine is actually the treatment of choice for feline hypertension. 14 Ultrasound was of value in the diagnosis of PKD, in evaluating the size and the number of the cysts and in demonstrating a cyst in the liver. High frequency transducers should be used to have a good resolution (>7 MHz). The genetic test was essential to confirm the inherited pattern.",
