            "text": "Gene 1 of the human coronavirus HCV 229E encompasses approximately 20.7 kb and contains two overlapping open reading frames, ORF 1a and ORF 1b. The downstream ORF 1b is expressed by a mechanism involving (01) ribosomal frameshifting. Translation of mRNA 1, which is thought to be equivalent to the viral genomic RNA, results in the synthesis of two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. These polyproteins contain motifs characteristic of papain-like and 3C-like proteinases, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, helicases, and metal-binding proteins. In this study, we have produced pp1ab-specific monoclonal antibodies and have used them to detect an intracellular, 105-kDa viral polypeptide that contains the putative RNA polymerase domain. Furthermore, using trans cleavage assays with bacterially expressed HCV 229E 3Clike proteinase, we have demonstrated that the 105-kDa polypeptide is released from pp1ab by cleavage at the dipeptide bonds Gln-4068/Ser-4069 and Gln-4995/Ala-4996. These data contribute to the characterization of coronavirus 3C-like proteinase-mediated processing of pp1ab and provide the first identification of an HCV 229E ORF 1ab-encoded polypeptide in virus-infected cells. \u1b67",

Thus, as is shown in Fig. 4 , nal protein sequence of the 28-kDa (pMal-Cpol) cleavage product was determined to be Ala-Ala-Gly-Leu-Cys-Val-Val, representing amino acids 4996 to 5002 of the HCV 229E 1ab polyprotein . These data show that two 3C-like proteinase-mediated cleavages, at dipeptide bonds Gln-4068/Ser-4069 and Gln-4995/Ala-4996, release the putative RNA polymerase domain from the HCV 229E 1ab polyprotein in the form of a 926-aminoacid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 105.5 kDa.",

We have also shown that the 105-kDa polypeptide is released from the gene 1encoded polyprotein precursor, pp1ab, by cleavage at the dipeptide bonds Gln-4068/Ser-4069 and Gln-4995/ Ala-4996, a reaction that is mediated by the HCV 229E 3C-like proteinase.",

The results shown here, and our previous work on the expression of the HCV 229E 3C-like proteinase (Ziebuhr et al., 1995) , indicate that, at least in the early stages of infection, these proteins are present in the cell in exceedingly low amounts. Indeed, the data suggest that it is only possible to detect polymerase translation products after the infection has progressed into the phase of genomic and subgenomic mRNA amplification. Also, as may have been predicted from in vitro studies on the level of HCV 229E mRNA 1 ribosomal frameshifting , we have found it more difficult to identify pp1ab-derived products compared to those derived from pp1a. For example, our attempts to immunoprecipitate the 105-kDa polypeptide using polyclonal antiserum, an approach which has proven successful for the detection of the HCV 229E 3C-like proteinase, have failed to produce convincing results. Obviously, if it is only possible to detect stable translation products as they accumulate in the virus-infected cell, it is going to be difficult to obtain detailed information on the expression and processing of the HCV 229E 1a and 1ab polyproteins. On the basis of the data obtained so far, a quantitative comparison of the amounts of ORF 1a-encoded (Ziebuhr et al., 1995) and ORF 1b-encoded polypeptides is, in our opinion, not possible. For example, the characteristics of the primary and secondary antibodies and the immunological assays that have been used in these studies are very different. Also, the genesis of gene 1-encoded polypeptides involves proteolytic processing, and we do not have any data on the kinetics of this process.
