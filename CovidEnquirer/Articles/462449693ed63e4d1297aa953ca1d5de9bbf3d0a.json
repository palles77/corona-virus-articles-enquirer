Many of these nsps have essential roles in viral replication, but several have no assigned function and possess amino acid sequences that are unique to the CoV family. One such protein is SARS-CoV nsp1, which is processed from the N-terminus of both pp1a and pp1ab. The mature SARS-CoV protein is present in cells several hours post-infection and co-localizes to the viral replication complex, but its function in the viral life cycle remains unknown. Furthermore, nsp1 sequences are highly divergent across the CoV family, and it has been suggested that this is due to nsp1 possessing a function speciWc to viral interactions with its host cell or acting as a host speciWc virulence factor. In order to initiate structural and biophysical studies of SARS-CoV nsp1, a recombinant expression system and a puriWcation protocol have been developed, yielding milligram quantities of highly puriWed SARS-CoV nsp1. The puriWed protein was characterized using circular dichroism, size exclusion chromatography, and multi-angle light scattering.",

This newly emerged virus prompted a renewed interest in CoV research. Prior to the SARS outbreak, only two CoVs (HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43) were known to infect humans [5] . These two CoVs have been estimated to cause up to 30% of common colds and mild respiratory illnesses [6] . Other CoVs are widespread in both domestic and wild animals, with several posing signiWcant economic impact on livestock and poultry industries.",

Viral proteases process pp1a and pp1ab to yield the mature viral nonstructural proteins (nsps, nsp1-nsp16 in SARS-CoV) [15, 16] . Many of these nsps have been associated with viral replication [17] , and so are also referred to as replicase proteins. Several of these nsps are unique to the CoV family or to individual CoVs. For example, SARS-CoV nsp1 exhibits weak sequence similarity only to the nsp1s of several other group 2 CoVs [4] .

Both SARS-CoV pp1a and pp1ab contain nsp1 at their respective N-termini. These two studies demonstrated that viral PL2 pro cleaves both polyproteins at 180 G#A 181 , producing the mature SARS-CoV nsp1 containing 180 amino acid residues with a calculated mass of 19.6 kDa. Furthermore, the mature SARS-CoV nsp1 was shown to be present in Vero cells at 4-6 h post-infection. SARS-CoV nsp1 was not detected as a component of a larger partially processed polyprotein intermediate within lysates from the infected cells, indicating that proteolytic processing at the nsp1-nsp2 cleavage site occurs rapidly following synthesis of pp1a and pp1ab. ImmunoXuorescence experiments revealed that SARS-CoV nsp1 co-localized with other replicase proteins into discrete cytoplasmic foci that were both perinuclear and dispersed throughout the cytoplasm [15, 16] . These cytoplasmic foci likely represent SARS-CoV replication complexes, where viral RNA synthesis occurs. These replication complexes form on double-membrane vesicles, with the vesicles likely constructed through viral manipulation of the cellular autophagy system [18, 19] . Later in infection, a more diVuse distribution of SARS-CoV nsp1 was observed, possibly indicative of a change in localization during the viral life cycle, or degradation of previously formed foci. Virus release from infected Vero cells occurred 3 to 6 h after the initial observation of the presence of nsp1 [16] .",

While comparisons of data regarding nsp1 from MHV and SARS-CoV must be conducted with caution due to signiWcant sequence diVerences, results from MHV nsp1 studies suggest an essential role for SARS-CoV nsp1. The N-terminal half of MHV nsp1 has been shown to be essential to produce an infectious virus, and point mutations within this region produced virus with altered replication and RNA synthesis [20] . The MHV nsp1 C-terminal half can be deleted or the nsp1-nsp2 cleavage site eliminated, and both mutations will yield viable virus but with delayed replication and lowered peak titers [20, 21] .",

The high sequence variability of nsp1 across the CoV family combined with the tendency for individual members of this family to possess a narrow host species range suggests that nsp1 may have speciWc host interactions, including suppression of host gene expression [22] . SARS-CoV is known to have expanded its host range from its natural reservoir (bats) to other animals present in live animal markets (e.g., palm civets, raccoon dogs) and to humans. Hence, it may be possible that mutations in nsp1 were involved in the evolution of the SARS-CoV host range. In order to further investigate these possible functions of SARS-CoV nsp1, we have undertaken the expression of recombinant protein in Escherichia coli, the puriWcation to homogeneity, and the characterization of this protein. In particular, structural studies require large quantities of highly puriWed and monodisperse protein samples, and the expression and puriWcation experiments described here were conducted with those goals in mind.",

Cleavage was nearly complete following incubation overnight at 4\u00b0C. The cleaved fusion tag, TEV protease, and any remaining uncleaved fusion protein was separated from the now tagless SARS-CoV nsp1 using a second IMAC column. Several of the minor contaminants, presumably E. coli proteins that co-eluted with the fusion protein on the initial IMAC run, were resolved from the cleaved SARS-CoV nsp1 during this step.

The same Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column and the same SEC buVer was used in both techniques, and the protein eluted as a single well-formed peak in all runs. For the standard SEC size estimation, the puri-Wed SARS-CoV nsp1 reproducibly eluted at 14.45 mL, corresponding to a molecular weight estimate of 37.2 kDa ( Table 2 ). The calculated molecular weight of the recombinantly expressed SARS-CoV nsp1 is 20.2 kDa, including six vector-derived N-terminal amino acid residues (GSLDAL) remaining post-cleavage. Thus, the molecular weight of 37.2 kDa estimated by SEC implies that the SARS-CoV nsp1 is present as a dimer (37.2/20.2 kDa D 1.84) in solution. The preparative scale SEC column was also calibrated using protein standards, and the molecular weight estimated from the results of this larger SEC column con-Wrmed the analytical SEC results (data not shown). The molecular weight estimated by SEC-MALS was 19.6 kDa. However, the protein eluted from the column at a similar elution volume as in the standard SEC run. These data implies that the SARS-CoV nsp1 are present as a monomer (19.6/20.2 kDa D 0.97) in solution, in contrast to the standard SEC results. The discrepancy in these results will be discussed below.",

The puriWed sample was stable in solution at concentrations of 1 mg/mL to 718 mg/mL, was present as a single well-deWned oligomeric state, and possessed a signiWcant amount of secondary structure. The use of an expression vector encoding a dual aYnity tag (polyhistidine and GST) allows for the possibility of puriWcation by two orthogonal aYnity methods. It is not unusual for a small number of native E. coli proteins to coelute with a recombinantly expressed fusion protein containing a single aYnity tag puriWed on the appropriate aYnity resin; whereas, it is unusual for a native E. coli protein to eVectively bind to both IMAC and glutathione resins. We have successfully used this dual tag/dual aYnity column procedure to highly purify a number of proteins, and in at least one instance (mouse HoxA5 homeodomain) the presence of the dual aYnity tag dramatically increased expression compared to the comparable fusion protein possessing only a polyhistidine tag (Umland, unpublished data). The Topo-HisGST-pET15bTEV was chosen for expression of recombinant SARS-CoV nsp1 for these reasons. Upon development of the puriWcation protocol, it was found that suYciently high purity was obtained by IMAC, followed by removal of high molecular weight aggregates by SEC. However, the presence of the GST portion of the aYnity tag provides options for future puriWcations, if required.",

For long term storage, the protein was Xash frozen in small aliquots using liquid nitrogen, and then stored at \u00a180\u00b0C. The preparation of a stable protein sample was an important goal, and is required prior to placing signiWcant eVorts into structural and biophysical studies. The protein was also resistant to proteolytic degradation. While no explicit proteolytic digestion assays were performed on the sample, there was no indication that native E. coli proteases caused any observable degradations either pre-or post-lysis. The lack of proteolytic degradation is important for easily obtaining a homogeneous sample. It is an indication that the protein maintains a globular fold, hindering proteolysis.",

The experimentally derived composition displayed reasonable agreement with the consensus prediction based on amino acid sequence alone. The major deviation between experiment and prediction was the experimental data indicated a higher than expected amount of -strand, resulting in a less than expected amount of random coil. Having more residues in a regular secondary structure conformation likely aids the stabilization of the protein, and is an indication of a well folded protein. However, it should be noted that the program k2d, used to analyze the CD data, considers random coil to include all residues that do not participate in an -helix or a -strand, and this term does not imply that such residues lack a deWned and stable structure within a given protein. The experimentally determined composition of 28% -helix, 33% -strand, and 39% random coil is consistent with values observed for other proteins having a globular fold. For example, using the same CD protocol, we have determined the secondary structure composition of another SARS-CoV protein (nsp9) as being 10% -helix, 39% -strand, and 51% random coil (unpublished results). These values compare extremely well with the values (13% -helix, 35% -strand, and 52% random coil) calculated from its crystal structure (PDB: 1UW7).

This method provided an estimated molecular weight for the puriWed recombinant SARS-CoV nsp1 of \u00bb37 kDa and indicated that it was present predominantly as a single species. These data can be interpreted as the protein being present as a dimer in solution, as the calculated mass of a monomer is 20.2 kDa. However, molecular weight estimation by traditional SEC is limited by the assumptions that the protein sample interacts with the column resin in an ideal fashion (e.g., no electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions), and the individual protein particles (monomers or complexes) are approximately spherical, as the elution pro-Wle is inXuenced not only by molecular weight but also by molecular shape.",

The sole role of SEC in a SEC-MALS experiment is to maximize the homogeneity of the sample being analyzed by MALS at any given instant, as MALS provides a weighted average of the molecular weight of all species in the aliquot under analysis. Molecular weight estimation by MALS is largely independent of molecular shape, and so the SEC-MALS results are inXuenced substantially less by non-ideal sample behavior then when using SEC alone. Analysis of 14 protein standards showed that the SEC-MALS method can routinely estimate molecular weights of native proteins within 5% [29] . SEC-MALS indicates that puriWed SARS-CoV nsp1 is present as a monodisperse monomeric population weighing 19.6 kDa in solution. The disagreement between the SEC and the SEC-MALS molecular weight estimations may be due to non-ideal interactions between the protein and the SEC media. However, it is likely an indication that the protein's shape deviates signiWcantly from spherical (e.g., oblate or prolate).
