This treatment has been widely applied in the preantibiotic era (1890-1930s) (Leider et al., 2010) . Modern use of convalescent therapy consists of blood products in the forms of screened whole blood, convalescent plasma, hyperimmune globulins (HIG/IVIG), and monoclonal antibody (MoAb), where HIG and MoAb are both derived from plasma through rigorous medical processes. HIG has been actively applied in the treatment of many bacterial and viral diseases, such as tetanus, hepatitis A/B, rabies, measles, complications of smallpox vaccination (Keller and Stiehm, 2000) . In addition, convalescent therapy has a strong track record of success in treating emerging infections such as H1N1, Spanish Influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Chikungunya (Kreil et al., 2012; Luke et al., 2006; Mair-Jenkins et al., 2014; Couderc et al., 2009) , and is considered as a potential treatment option for H5N1, middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Ebola (Luke et al., 2006; BRN, 2015; WHO, 2014b) .",

This interim guidance points out a dynamic treatmentdonation-stockpile positive feedback cycle: transfused patients survive from Ebola, convalescent survivors become donors and make donation to the blood bank, the blood bank storage is affected by the current blood usage and donation, and the blood bank level in turn determines the number of transfused patients.",

(2009) , in which a differential equation model was formatted to investigate the logistical feasibility of collecting convalescent plasma to treat severe cases of pandemic influenza in Hong Kong. This study assumes that only 0.5% of all infected cases are severe cases who are not expected to make donation after recovery, so the blood donation must be obtained from survivors of non-severe cases. Unlike pandemic influenza, Ebola is a fatal disease with a death ratio of 70% (Kucharski and Edmunds, 2014) and all cases receiving palliative care are severe. Therefore, with an urgent need of convalescent treatment in a large-scale population, all survivors are considered as potential donors. Moreover, for some developing countries with limited resources such as those in West Africa, blood donations are likely to expire quickly with underrated storage condition. With these concerns, we propose a model for convalescent treatment in a population that is applicable in epidemic outbreaks when no other treatment strategies are available.",

Aggressive use of blood storage indeed leads to lower CFR throughout the outbreak (Fig. 4c) , but also results in low blood storage level for a long time (Fig. 4d) . Conservative use of stockpile maintains higher blood bank levels for most of the time, but leads to large amount of donation waste (Fig. 4f) .

Parameters suggested in the WHO guideline are marked in the figures.
