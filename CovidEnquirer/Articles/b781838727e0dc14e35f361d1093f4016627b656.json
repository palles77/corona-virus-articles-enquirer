Pathogens were distributed among different age groups and respiratory viruses were generally active in July, September, and November. Enhanced surveillance and early detection can be useful in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of AFRS, as well as for guiding the development of appropriate public health strategies.",

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), lower respiratory tract infections killed more than 3,000,000 people in 2016, making it the third overall cause of death [2] . The viruses most frequently A detected in patients with ARIs include influenza-A virus (IFV-A), adenovirus (AdV), human coronaviruses (HCoVs), rhinovirus/enterovirus (EV/RV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneu); however, the clinical presentations of respiratory tract infections are similar, making it difficult to distinguish between etiologic agents of viral and bacterial pneumoniae without laboratory diagnosis [3] . An accurate and rapid laboratory diagnosis can have a positive impact on patient management, reducing the length of hospital stay, avoiding the unnecessary use of antibiotics, and suggesting the use of appropriate antiviral agents [4] .",

Accurate and rapid identification of the pathogens responsible for ARTIs is critically important for the application of appropriate antiviral therapies and prevention of excessive use of antibiotics [13] . Due to their sensitivity and rapidity, molecular technologies play a key role in early diagnosis and have evolved into laboratory diagnostic criteria [14] . A wide variety of pathogens can lead to respiratory infections, and pathogenic spectrum studies provide more accurate and clear information [15] [16] [17] . In the present study, a commercial diagnosis kit was used for detection of 18 respiratory virus and four bacteria by multiplex real time PCR, and at least one agent was identified in 51% of the nasopharyngeal swabs. This high rate of detection is similar to that reported in previous studies in which molecular methods were used [1, 18, 19] . Although the detection rate of other findings is low [20] , differences in virus-detection rates may depend on a variety of factors, including the specimen type, method used, working group, and when the study was performed [21] . It has been reported that men were more susceptible to viral respiratory infections than women [22] ; however, in the present study women were found to be slightly more susceptible, accounting for (53.33%) of the positive cases, although there were no significant differences between male and female patients (P = 0.3346). There were also no significant differences in the detection rate between the six age groups (P = 0.2124). The high overall detection rate and gender and age group analysis suggested that the overall population was susceptible to multiple respiratory viruses, which were also transmitted within the community.",

In our study, IFV-A was not only the agent most commonly detected in the IFV group, but also the most common of all detected viruses. Liao et al. [24] found the most common pathogen for causing respiratory infections in adults in China to be IFV-A, which was similar to our findings, indicating that IFV-A play an important role in ARTIs. AdV is considered to be an important cause of ophthalmology, as well as gastrointestinal and nervous system syndromes, and is also known to be an important cause of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children [25] . In the present study, AdV had the second highest detection rate, followed by IFV. Li et al. [25] reported that the detection rate of AdV in children in China was 13.8%, which was similar to the results of the present study. In an investigation in South Korea, the prevalence of AdV in children was only 4%, and the detection rate among adults was only 0.2% [26] , suggesting that the detection rate of the disease varies from region to region, and that Qinghai has a high AdV prevalence.",

Human coronaviruses are associated with respiratory syndromes ranging from mild upper to severe lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia and bronchiolitis [27] . In this study, the HCoVs group included four common respiratory coronaviruses with a detection rate of 8.09%, which was different from other reported cases in which HCoVs were rarely detected in ARTIs [28] . Similar to HCoVs, RV/EV and PIVs had a detection rate of 7.42% and 6.29%. RV/EV is now considered to be a major cause of lower ARTIs and asthmatic exacerbation [29] . PIVs can also cause upper respiratory disease and lower respiratory tract disease in people [30] . HCoVs, RV/EV, PIVs, and IFV were the major respiratory viruses among the 18 detected viruses. Notably, the detection rate of RSV was lower than the aforementioned viruses. RSV is known as the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants and young children worldwide, with a detection rate of 28.1% [31] . This difference in detection rate indicates that RSV has geographical features.",

            "text": "Co-infection was a common phenomenon, with an incidence of 5% to 62% [32] . In this study, 18% of the samples were found to contain more than two pathogens at the same time, and the detection rate of co-infection was higher than that of individual infection. Specifically, almost all of the pathogens were mixed infections, and HCoVs, PIVs, RSV, and AdV were more common in mixed infections. Zhang et al. [33] found the most prevalent viral agents in co-infections to be IFVs and RV, which was similar to our finding that the IFV group was most commonly detected with other pathogens. However, in another study, HBoV and HMPV were found to be the most common co-infecting viruses [22] . Although the detection rate of co-infection was high, further study is necessary to determine its clinical significance. Most studies conducted to date have shown that the presence of multiple pathogens in a respiratory sample does not affect the clinical manifestations of ARTIs [29, 32, 33] . The development of quantitative real-time PCR provides a route for viral load assessment and may be a better choice for the interpretation of positive co-infection results, but its potential value needs further clarification [34] . ARTIs are usually seasonal, particularly in regions with temperate climates. In the Northern Hemisphere, respiratory viruses are reportedly more active during the fall and winter (generally from November to March) [22] . Interestingly, IFV (IFV-A mainly) did not peak in the autumn months or winter in the present study, but it began to appear in July and September ( Figure 1C ). HCoVs and RV/EV peaked in July, and AdV peaked in winter. When compared to previous reports [22] , peak-time differences could be explained by fewer cases, annual variability, or regional differences in the present study.",

Moreover, the distribution of pathogens varied among age groups. In our region, respiratory viruses were generally active in July, September, and November, and the peak months for the identified agents were different from each other over a three-year period. Finally, the results indicated that a multiplex real-time PCR assay could be a suitable and effective method for the early detection and monitoring of respiratory pathogens to control the spread of infection and contribute to public health surveillance efforts.",
