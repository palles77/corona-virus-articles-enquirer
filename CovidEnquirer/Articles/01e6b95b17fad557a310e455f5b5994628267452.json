The human rhinovirus C (HRV-C) species was discovered in 2006 [3] , and it is N more virulent than HRV-A and HRV-B species, which are associated with severe illnesses such as pneumonia, acute wheezing, and exacerbation of asthma in infancy [4] . Human bocavirus (HBoV) was identified in 2005 from human nasopharyngeal aspirates of patients with respiratory tract illness [5] . Acute wheezing was the most common clinical symptoms observed in HBoV-infected patients [6] . Infections caused by these two viruses pose a substantial disease burden to young children; however, the biological properties and pathogenesis of HRV-C and HBoV have not been fully clarified. The ability of HRV-C and HBoV to propagate in traditional monolayer (2D) cellular culture or animals represents the bottleneck that limits related studies.",

The development of suitable cell culture models is thus promising for studying the life cycle of infectious viruses and their interactions with the host. Previously, studies have shown that HRV-C15 and HRV-C11 strains propagate in fully differentiated human nasal or bronchial epithelial cells [8] , and HRV-C15 and HRV-C41 strains propagate in the differentiated human sinus epithelial cells [9] [10] [11] . Additionally, HRV-C2, HRV-C7, HRV-C12, HRV-C15, and HRV-C29 types were all capable of mediating productive infection in reconstituted 3D human airway epithelia [12] . Human trachea epithelial cells were previously cultured in an air-liquid interface (ALI), and they formed a pseudostratified epithelium, in which HBoV propagated [13] . These studies suggest that novel 3D tissue-like cell culture systems are suitable for studying HRV-C and HBoV.",

Cells cultured in Matrigel show many differences in gene and protein expression, survival, proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism, compared to those cultured by traditional 2D culture methods [15] [16] [17] [18] . Cells grown in 2D and 3D cultures also respond differently to chemical drugs or radiation [19] [20] .

In the current study, we constructed a 3D cell culture model using Matrigel as the scaffold and measured the propagation abilities of HRV-C and HBoV using this platform.

At this time, HRV-C RNA content began to decline. The level of HRV-C released into the supernatant followed a similar trend for HRV-C infection of 3D-cultured HAE cells.

The immune response to virus includes the vigorous production of cytokines and chemokines including IL-8 and IL-6 [43] [44] [45] . Cytokines/chemokines play a critical role in regulating local inflammatory processes in the lung and subsequent tissue damage. Concentrations of these cytokines/chemokines secreted by respiratory epithelial cells might correlate with disease severity [46] [47] . The results of this study showed that two peaks of cytokine secretion occur in 3D cultures after infection. We think that the inoculated virus initially enters the cell, stimulating the secretion of cytokines/chemokines, which results in the first peak. The cytokines activate the cellular self-protection mechanism, which results in the subsequent decrease. Upon amplification of new virus, cells secrete more cytokines/chemokines, resulting in the appearance of the second peak. Cytokine secretion by 3D-cultured HAE cells, after infection with HRV-C or HBoV, indicates that 3D cells exhibit an activated innate immune response against HRV-C and HBoV; however, further studies are required to elucidate the exact mechanisms of antiviral innate immunity and virus replication.",

We cultured different cell lines (A549, BEAS-2B, MCF-7, HNEPC, HAE, and HBEC-3KT) in Matrigel, and then attempted to infect them with HRV-C and HBoV. Finally, we identified two types of human normal airway epithelial cells, HAE (primary cell line) and BEAS-2B cell (immortal cell line), that were suitable for 3D growth and for inoculation and isolation of the viruses. It is likely that the other cell lines (A549, MCF-7, HNEPC, and HBEC-3KT) no longer express the receptor or specific structures (such as cilia) required for respiratory virus invasion. The results of this study showed that both HRV-C and HBoV can propagate in 3D-cultured HAE cells (primary), but not well in BEAS-2B (immortal) cultures. This might be due to decreased differentiation ability and absence of specific features of organotypic tissue in the immortal cell lines, compared to those features in primary cell lines.",
