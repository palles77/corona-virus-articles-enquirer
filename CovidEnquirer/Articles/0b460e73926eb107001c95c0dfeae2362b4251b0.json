Among COVID-19 patients in Qingdao, 24 (80.00%) of them had IgM antibodies against at least one respiratory pathogen, whereas only one (2.63%) of the patients in Wuhan had positive results for serum IgM antibody detection (P<0.0001). The most common respiratory pathogens detected in Qingdao COVID-19 patients were influenza virus A (60.00%) and influenza virus B (53.33%), followed by mycoplasma pneumoniae (23.33%) and legionella pneumophila (20.00%). While the pattern for coinfection in patients with community-acquired pneumonia in Qingdao was quite different, with a positive rate of only 20.90%. Interpretation: We reported a large proportion of COVID-19 patients with coinfection of seasonal respiratory pathogens in Qingdao, northeast China, which differed greatly from the patients in Wuhan, central China.

The disease has soon developed into an outbreak posing a pandemic threat. Since no causative pathogen was identified at the onset of the disease, it was once called \"Wuhan pneumonia\" by the health officials and the public. On December 31, 2019, a total of 27 cases were reported; meanwhile, a rapid response team led by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) was formed to conduct detailed epidemiologic and aetiologic investigations in Wuhan. 1 ",

We speculated that if any common respiratory pathogen, such as influenza and parainfluenza viruses, RSV, ADV, MP and CP, or the previous emerging novel coronaviruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, was isolated from body fluids and secretions of the infected patients, related treatment and management could have been implemented in the first place.

Our assumption was led support by two recent studies conducted in Wuhan showing that there was no coinfection of respiratory pathogens in COVID-19 cases. 3, 9 According to our data, the majority of COVID-19 patients in Qingdao were not from the endemic area; they were infected indirectly without a history of traveling to Wuhan. Despite the high coinfection rate in Qingdao patients who had more complicated clinical conditions Here we also compared the geographical and climatic characteristics of Qingdao and Wuhan. Wuhan is located in the centre of southern China and has a subtropical climate; 16, 17 while Qingdao is situated in the coastal area of northern China in the temperate zone, which has a relatively lower humidity than Wuhan. 18 Despite the difference in natural characteristics between the two cities, common respiratory pathogens circulate in Wuhan and Qingdao (including IFV-A, IFV-B, RSV, and ADV) have shown to be generally similar during the peak season of respiratory diseases in wintertime (from January to February). [19] [20] [21] [22] The incidence of coinfection in COVID-19 patients in Wuhan was rather low. Whereas in places with relatively low temperature like northern Qingdao, it is more common to find combined SARS-CoV-2 infection with other seasonal respiratory pathogens. It is not yet known whether this phenomenon also exists in other regions, leaving a gap for future studies.

Otherwise these COVID- 19 It is notable that there are several limitations of this study. Two critically ill patients and one patient who died in the end were excluded due to lack of aetiological data other than SARS-CoV-2. As of February 16, 2020, there were 60 cases of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Qingdao, however, we only analysed 30 non-severe cases whose complete aetiological and clinical information was available. The age of patients in Qingdao ranged from 1.5 years to 80 years; whereas patients in Wuhan were all adults as they were medical professional infected through work. Such age difference between the two groups might bring in bias to this study. We performed nucleic acid testing for the confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, while coinfection with other pathogens was detected by serological testing of antibodies. In spite of superior accuracy, PCR-based molecular testing using throat swabs requires more complicated techniques of laboratory personnel with prolonged reporting time, which may not be suitable for emerging cases of SARS-CoV-2. 28,29 Thus, we applied rapid testing of aetiological agents by IIF in collected acute phase serum to guide clinical decision making. Since both the hospitals in Qingdao and Wuhan adopted the same protocol for the diagnosis of coinfection, we believe this will not affect the determination of final outcomes. All rights reserved.

Whether immune regulation associated with earlier infection with common respiratory pathogens confers an element of protection against the pathological damage caused by subsequent infection of SARS-CoV-2 remains unanswered. A study conducted in Zhejiang Province, China revealed that COVID-19 patients outside of Wuhan had relatively mild symptoms as compared with those initially reported in Wuhan. 13 Like patients in Qingdao, these Zhejiang patients had no direct contact with the original site of outbreak (Wuhan Huanan Seafood Market). Evidence is scarce at the present stage to explain whether it is due to the weakening of SARS-CoV-2 virulence during virus transmission. Previous studies on SARS have shown that the disease was more infectious at an earlier stage when compared to the later stage. 14 The global mortality rate of MERS was about 40% and declined sharply to less than 20% during second generation transmission. 15 Currently, our first priority is to slow transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Some of the patients are still under hospitalised treatment or in quarantine, requiring a multidisciplinary approach to illustrate the underlying mechanisms in the future.",

Our findings provide some important implications for the prevention and management of COVID. First of all, it is very effective and efficient for the China CDC and local governments to launch series of aggressive measures to screen, quarantine, diagnose, treat and monitor suspected patients and their close contacts in response to the widespread transmission of the virus. Moreover, we must remain vigilant when dealing with COVID-19 cases in other locations outside of Wuhan. Even common respiratory pathogens are detected by diagnostic testing, we still need to rule out the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In light of the emergence of coinfected COVID-19 cases, there might be a long-term coexistence of SARS-CoV-2 with humans, just as other seasonal respiratory pathogens. Last but not least, we highly recommend adding SARS-CoV-2 to the diagnostic testing assay as soon as possible, in a manner as how we routinely screen influenza and parainfluenza viruses, RSV, ADV, MP and CP, etc. Our hospitals adopted the above-mentioned screening and surveillance protocol right after the recognition of first coinfected COVID-19 case.
