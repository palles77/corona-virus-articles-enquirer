            "text": "Both natural and human-induced disasters result in mass casualty events (MCEs). Recently, there have been numerous natural (eg, hurricanes, earthquakes, flooding) and human-induced disasters (eg, gun violence, bombing, motor vehicle accidents) requiring the activation of hospital emergency response systems. Furthermore, the rising fear of terrorism and potential biochemical, nuclear, and radiological threats should encourage hospital systems and personnel to prepare for such events. Disasters are defined as incidents that require greater help than provided by typical resources of a (ie, hurricanes) must be identified and the signs of exposure to a dangerous substance (eg, chemical, biological, nuclear) must be recognized. Although environmental clues, such as broken containers labeled as ''hazardous material,'' fires, and smoke, may give responders an idea of what they are dealing with, there are also numerous causes of mass casualties that have a delayed presentation (ie, radiation and certain biochemical exposure) or lack overt toxidromes, making diagnosis and coordination of care difficult [5] . We briefly discuss several types of disasters resulting in MCEs.",

            "text": "Nuclear power plant accidents, acts of terrorism using a dispersion device (eg, bomb enveloped by radionuclides like strontium or cesium), or nuclear bomb detonation may result in exposure to ionizing radiation. Radiation injury may result from direct exposure to external sources (eg, devices that emit alpha and beta particles, gamma rays, x-rays), radiation-contaminated debris, or ingesting/ inhaling radioactive matter. The type of radioactive material, and the nature, length, and amount of exposure will result in variable effects on humans. For example, alpha particles cannot pass through human tissue, but can infiltrate pulmonary epithelium if inhaled. Lead shields can prevent the penetration of x-ray and gamma particles, whereas aluminum shields provide a barrier against beta particles. Nuclear explosions may result in thermal, crush, or blast injuries, which may occur concurrently. The emitted radiation from the blast may result in short-term and long-term sequelae. Radiation has the greatest impact on tissues with the highest regeneration rate (ie, gastrointestinal, lymphoid, bone marrow, and dermal tissue). Predictable injuries include radiation dermal and oropharyngeal burns, and acute radiation syndrome, which is manifested by bone marrow suppression, gastrointestinal destruction and bleeding, and septic shock. Psychological injury and cancer are long-term effects of radiation exposure. Victims of radiation exposure should be decontaminated at the site, removing all clothing and washing the skin with warm soapy water. Although treatment is supportive, certain medications may be given to reduce absorption or enhance renal excretion of radionuclides. Potassium iodide must be given within 24 hours of radiation exposure to effectively prevent radiation-induced thyroid adverse effects or cancer triggered by iodine-131 (I 131 ) release from a reactor accident [6] .",

Although there are 192 nations that have consented to be bound by the Chemical Weapons Convention (a treaty banning the manufacturing, storage, and use of chemical weapons, resulting in the eradication of more than 90% of chemical weapons in existence worldwide), there are still several countries that have not acceded to the treaty [7] . Furthermore, terrorist groups have used chemical weapons in attacks on civilians. Although it seems unlikely that US hospitals will see the effects of chemical weapons, there is no question that these agents may be used in terrorist attacks and clinicians should be familiar with the agents, their presentation, and treatment. Some examples of chemical agents include nerve agents like tabun (GA), sarin (GB), soman (GD), V agents, Novichok agents (which work through inhibiting acetylcholinesterase), blood agents such as cyanogen chloride and hydrogen cyanide (which inhibit oxidative electron transfer in the mitochondria, thus, inhibiting cellular respiration), pulmonary agents such as phosgene and chlorine (which cause asphyxiation by displacing oxygen) [6] , and vesicants such as lewisite and sulfur mustard (HD) [1] . Although atropine, oximes (ie, 2-PAM), and benzodiazepines are the classic treatment for nerve agents, Moshiri and colleagues [8] reviewed several promising strategies including the use of magnesium sulfate, alkalinizing the urine with NaHCO 3 , ketamine, benactyzine, galantamine, and phosphotriesterase.",

This may compromise economic and national security, disrupt the ability to obtain information, impair communication technology, and may indirectly result in death [10] . Furthermore, if a cyber-attack were to occur during a disaster or MCE, it could interfere with acquiring critical information and hinder communications between disaster responders, such as local and governmental agencies, hospitals, health care providers, and police officers. This could significantly impede the rescue and response efforts and result in serious adverse consequences and damages. Hospital computer networks also may be compromised, which may interfere with services provided and risk the appropriation of personal patient health information by cyberterrorists [11] .

Although harmless to people, it causes widespread power surges and disruption of equipment connected to power grids, telecommunication infrastructures, and communication systems. The current and voltage surges can destroy electric circuitry and damage electronic devices and computers; this includes hospital equipment (eg, life-support systems, computed tomography scans, diagnostic equipment) and computer systems, which are some of the most vulnerable systems. Equipment may be compromised even if it is not directly connected to a conductor [12] . The effects are less severe over greater distances, and electronic equipment that is powered off at the time of the incident is less likely to be affected. The effects can be severe enough to cause a blackout lasting months to years and destroy electrical grid infrastructures that may take years to replace [12] . Using EMP-resistant circuits, solar-powered equipment, batteries, unplugging and turning off unused electronic equipment, shielding vulnerable devices (eg, hospital monitors, pulse oximeters), and having an available back-up power system may help mitigate the effects of HEMP incidents. A cache of equipment can be maintained wrapped in nonconductive bubble-wrap that is then sealed in layers of aluminum foil. This will block both the electric and magnetic components of an HEMP impulse.",

Such events mainly occur in areas of combat, but they also occur in noncombatant regions (eg, Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, 2005 London metro bombings, 2017 Las Vegas shooting), affecting civilians [13, 14] . Medical professionals have a responsibility to prepare for and respond to these events that result in numerous victims suffering from extremely severe and complex injuries [13, 15] . Gunshots and explosions result in different injury profiles and hospital resource allocation [15] . Although explosion victims often present to hospitals at the same time in groups, gunshot victims are more likely to arrive as individuals. The treatment, resources, and hospital organizational response differ between the 2 injury patterns. A sudden and simultaneous presentation of multiple victims to a hospital puts a strain on resources that may result in the hindrance of patient treatment [15] . Some bombs may be constructed with nails, metal, and other sharp objects. This results in victims suffering from most or all of the following injuries: perforated eardrums and hearing loss; and penetration, blunt, burn, and crush injuries [13, 15] . Thus, surgeons must prioritize which injuries to address first and how to manage complex cases, such as the presence of 2 concurrent injuries with conflicting treatment strategies (eg, blast lung with extensive burn injuries complicating fluid management for hemorrhagic shock) [13, 15] . Explosive injuries are more likely to affect different regions of the body, whereas gunshot wounds may be more localized. Additionally, gunshot wounds are associated with higher early mortality rates compared with bomb victims. Explosion victims typically have longer hospital courses and require ICU care more than gunshot wound victims [15] . In both these injury types, large numbers of victims often require immediate surgical intervention, massive transfusion protocols, mechanical ventilation support, ICU-level care, and prolonged hospitalization. This strains hospital resources, such as blood bank supplies, equipment (eg, ventilators), beds, ORs, and staff [16] . It is important to have hospital management guidelines in place for such events to triage patients, allocate resources, and provide adequate staffing.",

Emergency drills should be occasionally performed to prepare for unanticipated emergencies. There are numerous online Web sites of organizations, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which have family plans, materials geared toward kids, communication resources, and updated information on what to do in certain disasters [6] .

Additionally, hospital infrastructure may be in peril in natural disasters, such as a flood or hurricane, and health care workers and responders are at risk of contamination and exposure to toxic substances when dealing with biochemical or nuclear events. Hospitals must first perform a hazard vulnerability analysis that determines if there is an internal disaster (eg, fire, flooding, power outage) or external disaster (eg, terrorist bombing). They may even be faced with challenging situations when both internal and external disasters occur simultaneously [19] . Hospitals then determine the impact the event(s) would have on its institution, and the extent of their response capabilities and available resources. They must factor in space (eg, hospital bed availability; waiting room space; triage areas; OR, ICU, and ED beds; use of other care areas, such as clinics), supplies (eg, medications, ventilators, blood products), and staffing (eg, physicians, nurses, pharmacists). It is important to note that in addition to the victims of an MCE, the hospital already has routine patients who require medical attention. Hospitals must also triage these routine patients, provide treatment, and/or transfer them to a different facility [20] . It is crucial to avoid overadmitting patients, as resources become quickly consumed, and the quality of care may suffer [21] . Hospitals should have emergency plans in place, and should activate the Hospital Emergency Incident Command System (HICS) (see HICS section later in this article) [1] . Communications plans for staff call-up should be tested with the expectation that external wireless systems may be limited or unavailable; internal systems that rely on external wireless networks may be affected as well. Hospital emergency plans facilitate communication between responders, hospital staffing, and governmental agencies, coordinate obtaining additional resources, and have a chain of command that assigns various personnel specific roles and responsibilities [1, 20] . Clinicians must be prepared to be called into the hospital, stay in the hospital for more than 24 hours, and assume roles outside their usual practice. The hospital command center manages the disaster response until the event is resolved, and helps reestablish typical hospital operations. Government preparedness. Disasters or MCEs may exhaust local resources and require the assistance of federal and governmental agencies. Once a state of emergency is declared, FEMA may respond to the disaster. The US Department of Homeland Security's (DHS's) National Preparedness Goal states its main objective is ''A secure and resilient nation with the capabilities required across the whole community to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from the threats and hazards that post the greatest risk.'' The goal is based on core capabilities provided by the coordination of several governmental agencies and targets 5 areas: prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery ( Fig. 1) [22] . Based on the particular disaster, FEMA will coordinate the relief efforts through various governmental agencies and specific disaster management teams (ie, Disaster Medical Assistance Teams [DMAT]). Some of the key agencies involved in disaster response include US Departments of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Justice, Defense, Agriculture, and Commerce [6] . The DHHS created and uses the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) for crisis management [1] . Disasters related to public health threats may require CDC intervention to provide specialty trained medical staff, medications, and equipment [1] .",

SA is crucial for recognizing, responding to, and tempering threats. It helps in the formulation of response plans, execution of rapid decisions in dynamic situations, proper allocation and utilization of resources, and improves outcomes [23] . SA relies heavily on the correct information and good communication of the information among multiple event respondents [24] . Incorrect or insufficient information may lead to endangering rescuers and poor outcomes [24] . There is also shared SA, which entails communicating and relaying information about the event to authorities and other responders and promoting teamwork and cooperation [24] . An established flow of communication among disaster responders and the transmission of important information in a timely fashion is crucial. Awareness of cultural norms is also part of SA. Electronic surveillance and wireless communication systems help facilitate information flow and distribution [24, 25] . Barriers to satisfactory SA include (1) lack of universal operational models; (2) poor communication; (3) incorrect, insufficient, or outdated information; and (4) undefined information-sharing plans and routes [24] . Norri-Sederholm and colleagues [24] surveyed emergency paramedics to determine what information was crucial to successfully respond and manage emergency medical situations. There were 5 important information categories identified: mission status, area status, incident data, safety at work, and tactics. Incident data was the most important category, as this provides basic information about the event, number of victims, nature of the event, ages of the victims, and other details about the event (eg, are there victims trapped somewhere, are there any obstacles preventing responders from getting to the victims). Mission status includes the number and type of personnel assigned to respond to the event, the number of respondents required for that particular event, estimated time, and confirmation of a completed mission. Area status refers to the number of responding units available, the type of units that are available, the location of the units, and urgency of the missions. Safety information is obtained from police or authorities at the scene to let responders know if there are any safety risks to personnel (eg, active shooter, biochemical exposure, unexploded ordinance). Finally, tactical details include coordinating response and obtaining instructions from the police, devising a response plan, and communicating said plan to other authorities involved (ie, police) [24] .",

Their training teaches them to be adaptable to critical and changing situations and they are comfortable providing care for patients in different hospital settings such as the ED, OR, and ICU. Depending on the type of disaster and hospital's emergency preparedness plan, anesthesiologists may be asked to help triage patients and provide services outside the OR (eg, at the disaster site, ED, post anesthesia care unit (PACU), and ICU). European countries have already expanded the role of anesthesiologists to be an integral part of the emergency medical services, providing prehospital and on-site care for traumas and disasters [37] .",

There are insufficient studies and data comparing the various triaging systems to recommend the use of one over the others. One study demonstrated that SALT was a more accurate triage method compared with START, but this was performed in MCE simulations and the results have not been reproduced [41] . The SALT system is endorsed by the American College of Emergency Physicians, American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma, and the American Trauma Society [38] , but any triage system may be used. The purpose of the triage systems is to categorize victims based on the severity of their injuries and likelihood of survival, and to prioritize management and resource allocation [42] . Victims will be assigned to 1 of 5 categories: (1) Immediate, (2) Delayed, (3) Minimal, (4) Expectant, and (5) Dead [42] . Victims who are categorized as dead typically have unsurvivable injuries and present with no pulse; resuscitative efforts should not be initiated in this group. The expectant group is composed of patients with severe injuries who are unlikely to survive, and attempts at treating them would expend resources that are better allocated to others who are more likely to survive. The expectant patients should receive medications for comfort to allay their pain and suffering (eg, an elderly patient who has an 80% total body surface area burn presenting to the ED along with 10 other victims simultaneously). Victims categorized as minimal have minor injuries that do not require hospitalization. Delayed patients are hemodynamically stable and have injuries that may be addressed at a later time without adversely affecting outcomes. Finally, those who are categorized as immediate have survivable ",

In these circumstances, anesthesia providers face numerous challenges due to situational urgency, potential airway injuries, hemodynamic instability, difficult intubation, aspiration risk, limited equipment and supplies and potential exposure to infectious or harmful biochemical/radiation agents. Certain disasters or MCEs may result in a large number of victims requiring intubation. In these situations, it is important to be mindful of infectious epidemics and biochemical agent poisoning. Furthermore, certain disasters (ie, fire, explosions, mass shootings, natural disasters) may result in a large number of victims suffering from blunt, penetrating, or burn injuries that require intubation. The safest method and gold standard of securing the airway in MCEs is endotracheal intubation [43] . Rapid-sequence intubations are commonly performed, and manual in-line neck stabilization should be performed if a cervical spine injury is suspected. If the patient is affected by a nerve agent, succinylcholine should be avoided or administered in lower doses [44] . In the setting of biochemical toxicity or an infectious epidemic, staff and other patients may be exposed to the pathogen or toxin, especially in the setting of fulminant respiratory failure necessitating immediate intubation before safeguards can be put into place. Anesthesiologists may need to intubate patients wearing PPE, which may impair airway visualization, encumber manual dexterity, and result in prolonged intubation times. A supraglottic airway can be a faster way to establish an airway while in PPE or during difficult intubations, but it should be replaced by an endotracheal tube when deemed safe [45] . There is no difference in intubation times when comparing direct laryngoscopy to video laryngoscopy while wearing PPE; both intubating techniques are reasonable choices [46, 47] . The intubating instrument should be chosen based on provider preference, equipment availability, and the clinical picture. Supraglottic airways can be useful as a bridge to intubation or when large numbers of casualties preclude definitive airway management.",

Several professional societies developed information and training materials for civilians to provide PFA to others in times of crisis. In 1990, the Danish Red Cross initiated a PFA training program that educated and established an organization of staff personnel who were capable of supporting individuals and family members during a disaster or traumatic event. PFA is analogous to physical first aid, and is not provided by mental health professionals. It is often provided by friends, family members, or other disaster victims. The training model is composed of 3 elements: disaster intervention, providing support, and knowing when to involve mental health professionals. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies built on this model and developed a training manual in addition to training sessions for volunteers. The training model is based on 6 components: background of psychological support, communication skills, a basic understanding of stress and coping mechanisms, fostering community involvement, providing support for special needs populations, and providing support for PFA volunteers. The American Red Cross created its own PFA model that employed mental health professionals during disasters. However, this model had several drawbacks including a limited number of professionals, inconsistent availability schedules, the inability to access the professionals (ie, incapability of transporting the professionals to where their services are required), and inadequate individual support when a large number of people are affected. The Institute of Medicine committee developed a PFA model based on evidence-based techniques that educates and equips individuals with skills that can be used to provide PFA for themselves and others. The skills taught may be applied in both small-scale stressful situations and during disasters. It helps individuals focus on their own mental health and wellbeing. Although ordinary individuals may provide PFA, it is important for them to recognize when a mental health professional's assistance is warranted [65] .",

Inadequate sleep may result in poor performance and predispose personnel to making mistakes, some of which may be life-threatening. The hospital response system should ensure that there are appropriate shift changes of personnel to allow other responders to maintain sleep. Additionally, health care personnel should be educated on the importance of sleep and maintaining sleep hygiene. In the Army, solders are specifically trained in sleep education, planning, management, and to develop unit sleep plans [66] .

Although most large disasters and MCEs are allocated to designated trauma centers in metropolitan areas, it is also likely that small rural community hospitals may need to respond to MCEs and provide care for victims. Failure to adequately prepare for these devastating situations may lead to delayed patient care and poor outcomes, as well as total hospital system collapse. Most hospital disaster preparedness training is focused on the ED.",
