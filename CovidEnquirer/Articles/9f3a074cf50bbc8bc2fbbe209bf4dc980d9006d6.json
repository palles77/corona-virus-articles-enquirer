Sequential extraction experiments showed that, after SCW treatment, heavy metals in exchangeable and carbonate forms in the ashes could be transferred into other relatively stable forms, e.g., Ba and Cr into residual fraction, Cu and Pb into organic matter fraction. SCWH treatment could stabilize heavy metals in Fe-Mn oxides and residual fractions. However, the behavior of As was quite different from heavy metals, which could be leached out from residue fraction after SCW and SWCH treatments. The leached As tended to absorb onto Fe-Mn oxides and organic matters under near neutral environment, but it could react with Ca 2+ at lower pH, increasing the mobility of this element. Therefore, it is necessary to neutralize acidic ash to near neutral condition before subjecting it to SCW and SCWH treatments so as to effectively stabilize hazardous elements in the ash. Consequently, it is believed that SCWH treatment is an effective alternative for hazardous elements detoxification in MW fly ash.",

In China, especially during SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), numerous MW incineration plants were built to treat the highly infectious MW. Thus large amount of MW ash was generated. Recent reports have shown that this special type of ash is quite different from ashes such as municipal solid waste ash since it is enriched by toxic chemicals such as heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [2, 3] . This special type of ash may cause secondary pollution to the environment if not properly treated. Currently, there are four major ways to treat the fly ash, i.e. melting treatment, chemical stabilization, cement solidification, and extraction, among which solidification is widely used because of its relatively low cost and easy operation, but there are several disadvantages in this method such as slow leaching of heavy metals from the treated ash and less effect on organic pollutants, which make it still be hazardous in the environment [4] . Therefore, detoxification of this type of fly ash is still a challenge to researchers.",

Furthermore, for MW fly ash, supercritical carbon could extract heavy metals effectively with different entrainers and more than 90% of Cu, Pb and Zn could be extracted from fly ash by cyanex 302 [7] .

Thus far, SCWO technique has been successfully applied to many kinds of wastewater and sludge treatments [10, 11] . Also, some reports showed that stable and hazardous aromatic compounds which formed and absorbed on the ash particle during the combustion process could be decomposed effectively by SCWO [12] . In addition, inorganic materials such as metal salts are insoluble due to the high polarity of ions, hence the circumstance of SCWO could force these metal ions move into more stable speciation which could reduce the mobility of the metals. However, most of the previous studies focused on the organic pollutants treatment using SCWO technique, while little information is available on the application of SCWO to the treatment of hazardous metals.",

After SCW treatment, the pH value of FAR increased from 3.32 to 5.21, but only slight change was observed for FAP. This indicated that at high temperature, the absorbed acidic gas released into the solution along with the oxidation of the activated carbon used in the APCD system.

It can be found that heavy metals in the ashes generally transformed from F1 and F2 into F4 and F5 fractions after the treatments. This process could attribute to the significant differences of solubility between organic and inorganic compounds in SCW. Briefly, heavy metals in F1 and F2 fractions firstly dissolved into the water during the hydrothermal process, when the temperature and pressure reach the critical point (647 K, 22.1 MPa), metal ions tended to precipitate. In addition, with organic compounds dissolving into SCW, metals which bound to organic compounds were released and precipitated. As a result, a large proportions of metals such as Ba, Cr and Zn transformed into F5 fraction after SCW treatment.",

These two metals tend to combine with organic matters again during the cooling process, hence they were mainly found in F4 fraction. Comparing Tables 2 with 3, it was found that Cd and Zn performed different trends between FAR and FAP after SCW treatment, i.e. Cd could not be detected in any fractions in FAR, but 57.1 mg/kg of Cd existed in FAP and 100% of which was in F3 fraction. This could attribute to the different pHs of the solutions during SCW treatment. The acidic solution formed by acidic gas from FAR was sufficient to leach Cd into the solution, while quite amount of Cd was stable in F3 fraction in FAP at near neutral pH. Similarly, the speciation of Zn was also strongly affected by pH after SCW treatment. The result showed that the amount of F3 and F5 fractions in FAP is 78.39% and 15.98%, compared to 30.5% and 57.55% in FAR, respectively. This indicated that Zn in F3 fraction was not stable and tends to transform into F5 fraction at low pH after SCW treatment.",

            "text": "However, organic compounds could not be decomposed completely without additional oxidant because of the low oxidation effect of SCW. Therefore, hydrogen peroxide was added to enhance the oxidation effect of SCW. From Tables 2 and 3 , it can be found that the amount of metals in F4 fraction decreased drastically whereas metals in F3 and F5 fractions increased after SCWH treatment. SEM images show that ash particle changed to porous structure ( Fig. 2b and d) after SCWH treatment, demonstrating the intense oxidation effect of SCWH on organic compounds coated on ash par- ticles [19] . Therefore, unlike SCW condition, heavy metals released from F1 and F2 fractions could not bind to organic matters under SCWH condition, e.g., 64.7-89.1% of Cu and 28.7-68% of Pb were found in F4 fraction in SCW treated ashes, but only 13-19% of Cu and 20-33% of Pb were in related fraction in SCWH treated ashes. Moreover, it is observed that Cd could not be detected in SCWH treated ashes, indicating that Cd released out from the ash particle into the solution under SCWH condition. It is interesting to notice that, unlike SCW treatment, after SCWH treatment, metals in F3 fraction either increased or remained unchanged, e.g., large amount of Cr remained in F3 fraction with percentages of 41% and 34% in FAR and FAP, respectively. Under SCWH condition, Fe-Mn oxides could be formed and heavy metals could be co-precipitated with Fe-Mn oxides or be oxidized to oxides. It has been reported that Fe-Mn oxides were thermodynamically stable under oxidation environment [15] . Therefore, it can be concluded that heavy metals originally in other fractions could be stabilized in this fraction under SCWH condition.",

It can be seen from Table 4 that large amount of Cu and Zn associated with F3 fraction after 1 h SCW treatment, with percentages of 57.6% and 48.2%, respectively, while after 4 h treatment, 89.1% of Cu combined to F4 fraction and 57.6% of Zn combined to F5 fraction. On the other hand, the speciation of Ba, Cr and Pb, which mainly existed in F4 and F5 fractions after SCW treatment, were less affected by the treatment time. It is well known that Fe oxide was not stable under acidic environment. Therefore, the acidic solution formed during SCW treatment could leach some metals out from F3 fraction.

It can be seen from with Ca 2+ to form calcium arsenates or be absorbed on ash particles. This process could contribute to the increase of As in F2 and F1 fractions. Therefore, it is necessary to neutralize the acidic ash to near neutral condition before subjecting it to SCW treatment. Furthermore, it can also be seen from Table 5 that the distribution of As speciation after 1 h SCWH treatment was similar to 4 h SCW treatment, and exhibited a minor change along with time. This indicates that the oxidation function could significantly accelerate the process of As transformation, and the distribution of As speciation could reach balance among the five fractions within 1 h under SCWH condition. Table 6 presents the TCLP results. For the raw ashes, the leached amount of Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn, which were 9.79 mg/l, 132 mg/l, 73.1 mg/l and 485 mg/l in raw FAR, while the leached amount of Cd, Pb, and Zn, which were 3.64 mg/l, 19.2 mg/l and 601 mg/l in raw FAP, respectively, greatly surpassed the permitted limits of USEPA and Chinese EPA [21] , implying that both the ashes are hazardous wastes. After SCW and SCWH treatments, the leachability of the heavy metals was significantly reduced. However, it can be seen from Table 6 that after SCW treatment, 14.6 mg/l of Pb and 204 mg/l of Zn could be leached from FAR, which still surpassed the permitted limit of the USEPA and Chinese EPA standards. But after SCWH treatment, the leaching amount of Pb and Zn remarkably decreased to 3.15 mg/l and 59.9 mg/l, respectively, lower than the permitted limit. It has been reported that metals locked with silica matrix (F5 fraction) could be hardly leached out under natural environment [22] . Therefore, compared to SCW treatment, SCWH could transform more metals to F5 fraction, which greatly reduced the leachability of heavy metals.",

Sequential extraction suggested that SCW could effectively transform Ba, Cr, Cu and Pb into F4 and F5 fractions, while SCWH made these metals mainly bound to F5 fraction. More heavy metals especially Cd and Zn could be leached out or transformed to F5 fraction at lower pH since the acidic solution could destroy Fe-Mn oxide under SCW condition. On the other hand, As could be extracted from F5 fraction after SCW and SCWH treatments, and tended to absorb onto Fe oxide and organic matters under near neutral condition. Thus it is necessary to neutralize the acidic ash to near neutral condition before subjecting it to SCW and SCWH treatments so as to stabilize As in the ash.

However, the transformation trends of the leached As was different between FAR and FAP. For FAR, As tended to transform to other four fractions, while for FAP, only the amounts of F3 and F4 fractions of As increased. It has been reported that As mainly exist as H 2 AsO 4 \u2212 at pH 2-7, which could be removed by forming Ca(H 2 AsO 4 ) 2 \u00b7nH 2 O or absorbing on iron (hydr)oxide from solution[20]. Accordingly, it is supposed that the leached As in FAP in the form of H 2 AsO 4 \u2212 was absorbed on Fe oxide and organic matters, which contributed to the increase of As fractions in F3 and F4. Meanwhile, in FAR, the acidic solution could destroy Fe oxide, causing As, in the form of H 2 AsO 4 \u2212 , either reacted",
