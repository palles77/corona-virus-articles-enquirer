In the 8 years since its entry into force, there have been three declared PHEIC, including pandemic infl uenza H1N1 in 2009, re-emerging wild-type poliovirus in April, 2014, Ebola virus disease in west Africa in August, 2014, and the emergence of new diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and infl uenza H7N9, with still uncertain risks to global population health.",

The regulations have served as a valuable guidepost for national and international capacity building, coordination, and collaborations for global health security. Other international fora have also recognised the importance of the IHR as a global framework, and have focused discussions among nations on IHR-related core capacities in meetings of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, the Global Health Security Initiative, the North American Plan for Pandemic and Avian Infl uenza, the Convention on Biological Diversity, and United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540, in addition to debate at the World Health Assembly.",

In February, 2014, the USA, along with almost 30 nations and the Directors-General of the WHO, Food and Agriculture Organization, and Organization for Animal Health, launched the Global Health Security Agenda to address several high-priority, global infectious disease threats. Foundations have become increasingly engaged in global health security, becoming primary funders for capacity building around the world, and the World Bank is playing an increasingly more prominent role in global health preparedness and response.",

            "text": "Yet by 2012, only 42 nations (21%) reported that they had fully implemented the IHR and built appropriate core capacities to detect, assess, report, and respond to public health emergencies. With follow-up reporting in 2014, only 64 nations reported that they had fully implemented the IHR-an increase of only 10% over 2 years. The other 67% of nations either requested another 2-year extension (81) or reported nothing at all (48). 2 National compliance statistics are themselves an indicator of the challenges associated with IHR implement ation, particularly the paucity of mandated funding to support capacity building. Additionally, it has become clear that the methods for assessing health security preparedness leave substantial room for interpretation, and there are ongoing disagreements over the mandate for the airport or port health certifi cation programme outlined in Article 20.",
