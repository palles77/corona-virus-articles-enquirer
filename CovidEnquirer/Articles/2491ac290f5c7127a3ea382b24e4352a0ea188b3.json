Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the characteristics of severe respiratory failure associated with WUPyV infection in children. Study design: We retrospectively reviewed cases of respiratory tract infection at a tertiary children's hospital in Japan and performed real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for WUPyV using residual extracted nucleic acid samples taken from respiratory tract samples of pediatric patients primarily with respiratory failure. We investigated the clinical characteristics of patients positive for WUPyV and assessed samples positive for WUPyV for other respiratory pathogens using multiplex PCR. Results: WUPyV was detected in 14 of 318 specimens of respiratory tract infections. The median age was 34 months and males were predominant (n = 11, 64%). An underlying disease was found in 11 (79%) patients including five preterm and three immunocompromised patients. The most common clinical diagnosis was pneumonia (n = 13, 93%). The majority of the samples were endotracheal tube aspirates (n = 11, 79%). Other viruses were co-detected in nine (64%) patients, while WUPyV was the only pathogen detected in five patients with a history of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. These five patients presented with fever and cough, and perihilar infiltrates were detected on chest radiograph in several days. Conclusions: WUPyV was detected in children with severe respiratory failure independently or concurrently with other pathogens. WUPyV can be a pathogen for children with a history of preterm birth or an underlying disease.",

An underlying disease was found in 11 (79%) patients, including five preterm children and three immunocompromised patients. The details of the patients are shown in Table 2 . The sequences of WUPyV had been identified from sputum specimens by metagenomic analysis from one immunocompromised child with respiratory failure (Table 2 , Patient 3, Supplementary Data 1). The patients were classified into four groups based on their underlying conditions: immunocompromised (Group 1), preterm (Group 2), other underlying diseases (Group 3) or previously healthy patients (Group 4). All cases with prematurity (Patients 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) and other underlying disorders (Patients 9, 10, 11) had a history of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Other viruses were co-detected in nine patients while only WUPyV was detected in five patients (Patients 5, 7, 9, 10, 11) . Sputum cultures were evaluated in 11 patients, but clinically significant bacterial pathogens were not detected. All five patients in whom only WUPyV was detected had a history of admission to the NICU and presented with fever, cough, and respiratory distress and were intubated within one to six days after the onset of symptoms. The chest X-rays of the five patients are shown in Fig. 1 . Typical findings were apparent perihilar bilateral infiltration compatible with viral pneumonia.",

In these cases, the WUPyV viral protein was detected by immunohistochemical staining of tissue from the respiratory tract, including lung tissue, which indicated the possibility of a pathogenic role for WUPyV in immunocompromised patients [11, 12] .",

To our knowledge, no report has documented the association of prematurity or history of NICU admission with WUPyV infection. It is well known that prematurity is a risk factor for a number of respiratory virus infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus. Immature cell-mediated immunity and lung function (functional residual capacity, compliance, and resistance of the respiratory system) are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis [13, 14] . A similar pathogenesis may also be at work in the lower respiratory tract of premature children with a WUPyV infection.",

Codetection of WUPyV with other respiratory viruses has often been reported in children and was consistent with the findings of our study [2, 4, 5] . It is still unknown if codetection of WUPyV with other viruses was associated with the severity of respiratory failure. A major limitation of this study is the lack of histological evidence of WUPyV infection. The pathogenic role of WUPyV in respiratory failure remains unclear. Nonetheless, WUPyV alone was detected from the lower respiratory samples of several children with respiratory failure, and our findings add new insights into the clinical importance of WUPyV in children.",
