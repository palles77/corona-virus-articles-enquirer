In buildings, graffiti can be found in restrooms and toilets, on walls of elevator lobbies and on walls and doors of elevator cars (particularly those of service or freight elevators), on walls adjacent to public telephones, and on exterior glass windows. Vandalism may also involve tampering with equipment (for example, standpipes on upper floors to cause flooding inside a building).",

The fourth, reportedly bound for the White house, crashed in an open field in Pennsylvania after several of its passengers fought against the hijackers. \"The events in new york City (nyC) on September 11, 2001, were among the worst building disasters and loss of life from any single building event in the United States.\" 35 Shockwaves from these acts reverberated throughout the United States and the world. Within 22 minutes of the second plane hitting the World Trade Center, all U.S. domestic flights were grounded. Within hours, owners and managers of major U.S. high-rises, including the Sears Tower in Chicago, advised occupants to leave their buildings. The Los Angeles Times reported that even in Europe, authorities evacuated high-rise buildings as a safety measure. 36 U.S. markets closed and foreign stock markets plummeted. U.S. President george W.

The heat produced by this burning jet fuel does not by itself appear to have been sufficient to initiate the structural collapses. However, as the burning jet fuel spread across several floors of the buildings, it ignited much of the buildings' contents, causing simultaneous fires across several floors of both buildings. The heat output from these fires is estimated to have been comparable to the power produced by a large commercial power generating station.

Some changes will be determined by the findings of the World Trade Center Building Performance Study and later studies. The following comments are from the World Trade Center Building Performance Study: 49 During the course of this study, the question of whether building codes should be changed in some way to make future buildings more resistant to such attacks was frequently explored. Depending on the size of the aircraft, it may not be technically feasible to develop design provisions that would enable all structures to be designed and constructed to resist the effects of impacts by rapidly moving aircraft, and the ensuing fires, without collapse. In addition, the cost of constructing such structures might be so large as to make this type of design intent practically infeasible. Although the attacks on the World Trade Center are a reason to question design philosophies, the BPS Team believes there are insufficient data to determine whether there is a reasonable threat of attacks on specific buildings to recommend inclusion of such requirements in building codes. Some believe the likelihood of such attacks on any specific building is deemed sufficiently low to not be considered at all. However, individual building developers may wish to consider design provisions for improving redundancy and robustness for such unforeseen events, particularly for structures that, by nature of their design or occupancy, may be especially susceptible to such incidents. Although some conceptual changes to the building codes that could make buildings more resistant to fire or impact damage or more conducive to occupant egress were identified in the course of this study, the BPS Team felt that extensive technical, policy, and economic study of these concepts should be performed before any specific code change recommendations are developed. This report specifically recommends such additional studies. Future building code revisions may be considered after the technical details of the collapses and other building responses to damage are better understood.",

Many of the buildings suffered severe fire damage but remained standing. However, two steel-framed structures experienced fire-induced collapse. WTC 7 collapsed completely after burning unchecked for approximately 7 hours, and a partial collapse occurred in an interior section of WTC 5. Studies of WTC 7 indicate that the collapse began in the lower stories, either through failure of major load transfer members located above an electrical substation structure or in columns in the stories above the transfer structure. The collapse of WTC 7 caused damage to the Verizon building and 30 West Broadway. The partial collapse of WTC 5 was not initiated by debris and is possibly a result of fire-induced connection failures. The collapse of these structures is particularly significant in that, prior to these events, no protected steel-frame structure, the most common form of large commercial construction in the United States, had ever experienced a fire-induced collapse. Thus, these events may highlight new building vulnerabilities, not previously believed to exist. possible considerations for improved egress in damaged structures, the public understanding of typical building design capacities, issues related to the study process and future activities, and issues for communities to consider when they are developing emergency response plans that include engineering response\u2026.",

W. norton & Company: new york & London. \ue02cwww.9-11commission.gov/report/index .htm\ue02e; July 2004:289). r A note (no. 46) in The 9/11 Commission Report to this reference was \"When a notable event occurred, it was standard procedure for the on-duty deputy fire safety director to make an 'advisory' announcement to tenants who were affected by or might be aware of the incident, in order to acknowledge the incident and to direct tenants to stand by for further instruction. The purpose of advisory announcements, as opposed to 'emergency' announcements (such as to evacuate), was to reduce panic\" (The 9/11 Commission Report, Chapter 9, note 46, citing various civilian and FDny interviews, and Port Authority of new york and new Jersey interviews and statements, 2004, p. 544). 68 The 9 over the South Tower's public-address system advised civilians, generally, that they could begin an orderly evacuation if conditions warranted. Like the earlier advice to remain in place, it did not correspond to any prewritten emergency instruction.\" 71 It must be realized that at the time the first plane hit the north tower, no one explicitly knew that this was a terrorist act or that another aircraft was only 16 minutes and 29 seconds away from slamming into the south tower. After the first collision there were large amounts of material falling from the crash site to the ground outside of the north and south towers as well as a number of occupants who had started jumping from upper floors. The first priority of the WTC emergency personnel would have been to address the life safety of occupants in the north tower. Based on the information known at the time, it would not have been considered prudent to evacuate occupants from the south tower, since this may have involved placing those persons in danger from falling objects. It was only after the second plane hit that an indication of the diabolical nature of the disaster was revealed. The tragic consequences of the September 11, 2001, attacks were directly attributable to the fact that terrorists flew large jet-fuel laden commercial airliners into the WTC towers. Buildings for use by the general population are not designed to withstand attacks of such severity; building regulations do not require building designs to consider aircraft impact. In our cities, there has been no experience with a disaster of such magnitude, nor has there been any in which the total collapse of a high-rise building occurred so rapidly and with little warning.",

Even by the standards of terrorism in India, which has suffered a rising number of attacks this year, the assaults were particularly brazen in scale, coordination and execution. \"The death toll from the series of coordinated attacks was at 101 [later estimated at 171], including at least six foreigners, by Thursday afternoon authorities said. The Italian Foreign Ministry confirmed one of its citizens had been killed. The nationalities of the others was still being checked. Another 314 people were wounded in the attacks, including seven British and two Australian citizens. In addition, at least nine gunmen were killed in fighting with police. Also among the dead was hemant Karkare, the chief of the Mumbai police's anti-terror squad, and as many as 11 police officers.\" 137 \"Ashok Pawar, a local police constable who arrived at the Taj Mahal Palace & hotel [ Figure 3 -8] shortly after the gunmen lay siege to it, said he could see their carefully scripted tableau in the closed-circuit TV cameras in the hotel's second floor security room. In two teams of two, the gunmen kicked down hotel room doors, forced guests to come out into the hallway, tied the men's hands behind their backs, usually with a bedsheet, and herded their captives into one room\u2026. The gunmen soon realized they were being watched, and so they smashed the cameras, lobbed a grenade and started firing at Mr. Pawar and his colleagues in the security room.\" 138 \"The leader of a commando unit involved in a gun battle Thursday morning inside the Taj said during a news conference on Friday that he had seen a dozen dead bodies in one of the rooms. his team also discovered a gunman's backpack, which contained dried fruit, 400 rounds of AK-47 ammunition, four grenades, Indian and American money, and seven credit cards from some of the world's leading banks. They pack also had a national identity card from the island of Mauritius, off Africa's southeastern coast. The attackers were 'very, very familiar with the layout of the hotel,' said the commander.\" 139 \"It is possible the Mumbai attackers chose the Taj and Oberoi because security at the two facilities was not as prominent or visible as in other hotels. In any case, that the Mumbai attackers pre-positioned explosives and other weapons for their use inside the hotel indicates they conducted extensive preoperational surveillance of the targets and likely understood the security countermeasures present in each location.\" 140 \"India has accused a senior leader of the Pakistani militant group Lashkare-Taiba of orchestrating last week's terror attacks that killed at least 172 people here, and demanded the Pakistani government turn him over and take action against the group. Just two days before hitting the city, the group of 10 terrorists who ravaged India's financial capital communicated with yusuf Muzammil and four other Lashkar leaders via a satellite phone that they left behind on a fishing trawler they hijacked to get to Mumbai, a senior Mumbai police official told The Wall Street Journal. The entire group also underwent rigorous training in a Lashkar-e-Taiba camp in Pakistanicontrolled Kashmir, the official said.\" 141 Subsequently, two senior leaders of Lashkare-Taiba and 20 other alleged militants were arrested by Pakistan and the death toll was amended to 171. 142 Commenting on the incident, \"What happened in Mumbai on november 26 will always remain etched in the minds of every Indian. The terrorists' attack on iconic buildings and elsewhere has definitely raised the issue of security of high-rise buildings, both commercial and residential, in our country.\" 143 \"While the Taj and Oberoi hotels probably were attacked in part because of their status as Mumbai landmarks, the direct targeting of foreigners indicates the hotels also were chosen in a bid to strike Westerners\u2026. The Mumbai attacks showed that attacking locations where Westerners are known to congregate, rather than attacks against marketplaces or cinemas that will primary kill Indian nationals, could well be a more efficient and effective way for militants to use their limited resources. And as hotels and other traditional soft targets harden their facilities and implement new security countermeasures to prevent further Mumbai-style attacks, militants will seek less-secure venues that will achieve the same result. Such targets could include apartment complexes or neighborhoods that primarily house Westerners-similar to the 2004 attacks on the Saudi Arabian Oil Co. residential facilities in Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia-or other soft targets such as Western-style marketplaces or restaurants.

The following incident of using an elevator to commit theft illustrates this point: was always the same. The computers would disappear from locked tenant spaces after normal business hours. There were never any visible signs of unauthorized entry. Every conceivable pathway, the thief might have taken to remove the items from the building was examined. It was determined that the only possible means for removal of the items was using the single service/freight elevator. However, after normal business hours this elevator was always programmed to be \"on security.\" It was finally ascertained that the elevator was being taken \"off security\" for a time period that coincided with the thefts. Further investigation revealed that a building engineer had accessed the elevator system remotely from his home computer and changed the elevator's security status. The engineer then had gone to the building and to the tenant floor using the freight elevator. The thefts were carried out using a building master key to gain access to the tenant suite. The stolen items were then loaded into the elevator car and transported down to the loading dock, where there were no CCTV cameras to view the incident. Later the elevator was then remotely placed back \"on security.\" Also, acts of vandalism can occur inside elevator cars. A possible solution is to install vandal-resistant interiors. (\"In general all lift [elevator] surfaces should be robust and resistant to damage from cleaning materials and body fluids. There should be no visible fixings [,] and gaps between moving parts should be restricted to avoid attack. Stainless steel is often specified in [a] hostile environment.\" 151 ) Another mitigating measure is the use of elevator cars with transparent sidewalls in a transparent elevator shaft. r however, the problem of elevator vandalism may be related to the operation of the elevator itself. As noted, \"clearly, installing vandal-resistant interiors and control panels in the elevator cabs will reduce the number of incidents and costs to repair damage. But if you are having repeated incidents, look beyond the surface. Is the elevator system control system working properly? Long wait times and long travel times will increase frustration. And more frustration is going to spur more elevator vandalism.\" 152 Despite the fact that elevators are a very safe form of transportation in modern high-rise buildings, elevator technicians and workers may sustain injuries or death while 151 Sustaining Towers website. \"Lifts.\" April 6, 2005. \ue02cwww.sustainingtowers.or/LIFTSa.htm\ue02e; December 6, 2008.",

Stack effect, as described by Quiter, \"results from the temperature differences between two areas, usually the inside and outside temperatures, which create a pressure difference that results in natural air movements within a building. In a high-rise building, this effect is increased due to the height of the building. Many high-rise buildings have a significant stack effect, capable of moving large volumes of heat and smoke through the building.\" 155 Radiation is the movement of heat across a space or through a material as waves.

The fire caused severe damage to the apartment and to an exit access corridor.\" 212 \"After unsuccessfully attempting to extinguish the fire, the occupant in the apartment of fire origin left without closing the dwelling unit door to the corridor. Fire and smoke passed through the open door into the exit access corridor and made that corridor untenable for many fifth-floor residents. The residents who did not escape early in the incident stayed in their apartments until they were rescued by firefighters. The combination of closed doors and noncombustible walls prevented untenable conditions and deaths from occurring in other fifth-floor apartments\u2026. In many instances, the people who remained in their apartments or moved to the balconies were exposed to less risk to their safety than those who attempted to escape.\" 213 Based on the nFPA's investigation of this fire, Staff members smelled what they thought was gas emanating from the buffet area of the coffee shop. Investigating its source, a staff member noticed that gas was leaking from the valve assembly of a 9-kilogram (20-pound) liquid propane gas cylinder.... The man tried to shut down the cylinder's main control valve. However, he inadvertently turned the valve the wrong way and, instead of shutting off the flow of gas, actually increased it. The vapor, expanding as it was released, quickly ignited....",

The opening of the door irretrievably compromised the stairwell as a safe escape route. Approximately 80 minutes after opening the door, the Fire Department searched the stairwell above the 14th floor for the first time.

According to long-term records (since about 1900) , we expect about 18 major earthquakes (7.0-7.9 ) and one great earthquake (8.0 or above) in any given year. However, let's take a look at what has happened in the past 32 years, from 1969 32 years, from through 2001 32 years, from , so far. Our records show that 1992 32 years, from , and 1995 32 years, from -1997 were the only years that we have reached or exceeded the long-term average number of major earthquakes since 1971 . In 1970 and in 1971 A temporal increase in earthquake activity does not mean that a large earthquake is about to happen. Similarly, quiescence, or the lack of seismicity, does not mean a large earthquake is going to happen. A temporary increase or decrease in the seismicity rate is usually just part of the natural variation in the seismicity. There is no way for us to know whether or not this time it will lead to a larger earthquake. Swarms of small events, especially in geothermal areas, are common, and moderate-large magnitude earthquakes will typically have an aftershock sequence that follows. All that is normal and expected earthquake activity. 270 In many parts of the world, modern high-rise buildings in areas subject to earthquake activity are constructed in accordance with strict building codes. Older buildings erected before seismic design considerations may need structural retrofits to bring them up to code.",

The shaking of an earthquake may cause no structural damage, or it may cause damage so severe that the building collapses. Modern high-rise buildings can be seismically designed to withstand certain magnitude earthquakes. \"The idea of earthquake-proof construction is unrealistic, unless exceptionally expensive measures are taken. Any building will collapse if the ground under it shakes hard enough or becomes permanently deformed. But structures can be designed and constructed to incorporate a high degree of earthquake resistance.\" 271 As Dames and Moore/URS Corporation explained, \"To resist seismic forces, steel buildings are either constructed with braced frames (such as X-bracing) or moment frames (rigid beam-column assembly r ).\" 272 Many structures, particularly seismically designed steel-framed buildings, have been constructed to flex and move without breaking. Lower floors may shake more rapidly, but movement of the building from side to side is greatest on uppermost floors. \"To dissipate the force of the ground shaking through a tall structure, the building is designed to sway rr as a unit in a side-to-side motion.\" 273",

It severely impaired the public transportation network and residential community; 72 people were killed and 11,846 people were treated for earthquake-related injuries. Steel moment frames \"consist of beams and columns joined by a combination of welding and bolting\" (Property Risk. \"What are steel moment frames?\" \ue02cwww.propertyrisk.com/refcentr/steel-side.htm\ue02e; november 2, 2008). 272 Dames & Moore/ URS Corporation, \"how buildings fared,\" The Northridge Earthquake, January 17, 1994 (Dames and Moore: Los Angeles; 1994:21) . rr Most high-rise buildings are designed to sway in a gentle wind but not so much that occupants on upper floors experience motion sickness. The object is to \"make [the building] stiff enough that people wouldn't get sick, but not so rigid that it could snap if it got too big a load\u2026. Often big buildings are designed to be stiff enough that the period to go one way and back the other way is 15 to 20 seconds, or even 30 seconds. That keeps people from getting sick.\" (Eagar, Dr., Thomas, commenting on the World Trade Center collapse in \"Why the towers fell.\" April 30, 2002 [nOVA Online. \ue02cwww.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/wtc/collapse.html\ue02e; 2, 3; January 1, 2009] were attributed to heart attacks.\" 274 Thousands were left homeless in the wake of this disaster that had an insured loss of $12,500,000,000. 275 The January 17, 1994, northridge earthquake raised some serious safety concerns about the degree of earthquake resistance that high-rise buildings, in particular steel moment frame structures, afford. Unlike braced frames, these moment frames feature larger beams and columns, with additional welding or bolting of the connections. Before this earthquake, this structural system was thought to be among the safest seismically. As John hall, an associate professor of civil engineering at the California Institute of Technology, pointed out, During the 1994 Northridge earthquake, many modern steel buildings suffered unexpected fractures in welded beam-to-column connections. Although none of these buildings collapsed, fractured connections are a serious matter since they reduce the lateral strength of the structure, and, thereby, increase the risk of collapse. The problem is apparently widespread and, at this point, one must assume that any welded steel moment-frame is susceptible to this type of connection failure. 276",

It may be that some of these issues should be considered for all buildings; however, additional studies are required before general recommendations, if any, can be made for all buildings. The issues identified from this study of damaged buildings in or near the WTC site have been summarized into the following points: a. Structural framing systems need redundancy and/or robustness, so that alternative paths or additional capacity are available for transmitting loads when building damage occurs. b. Fireproofing needs to adhere under impact and fire conditions that deform steel members, so that the coatings remain on the steel and provide the intended protection. c. Connection performance under impact loads and during fire loads needs to be analytically understood and quantified for improved design capabilities and performance as critical components in structural frames. d. Fire protection ratings that include the use of sprinklers in buildings require a reliable and redundant water supply. If the water supply is interrupted, the assumed fire protection is greatly reduced. e. Egress systems currently in use should be evaluated for redundancy and robustness in providing egress when building damage occurs, including the issues of transfer floors, stair spacing and locations, and stairwell enclosure impact resistance. f. Fire protection ratings and safety factors for structural transfer systems should be evaluated for their adequacy relative to the role of transfer systems in building stability. The BPS Team has developed recommendations for specific issues, based on the study of the performance of the WTC towers and surrounding buildings in response to the impact and fire damage that occurred. These recommendations have a broader scope than the important issue of building concepts and design for mitigating damage from terrorist attacks, and also address the level at which resources should be expended for aircraft security, how the fire protection and structural engineering communities should increase their interaction in building design and construction, 50 These recommendations are extracted directly from the FEMA 403: World Trade Center Building Performance Study: Data Collection, Preliminary Observations, and Recommendations.

Since then some cities have installed interoperable radio communication systems. should also be educated about the expected performance of their building when renovations, or changes in use or occupancy, occur and the building is subjected to different floor or fire loads. For instance, if the occupancy in a building changes to one with a higher fire hazard, stakeholders should have the fire protection systems reviewed to ensure there is adequate fire protection. Or, if the structural load is increased with a new occupancy, the structural support system should be reviewed to ensure it can carry the new load. Report on the Collapse of the World Trade Center Towers The national Institute of Standards and Technology (nIST) assembled a team to prepare a nIST nCSTAR 1: Federal Building and Fire Safety Investigation of the World Trade Center Disaster: Final Report on the Collapse of the World Trade Center Towers. According to the report's abstract, 51This report describes how the aircraft impacts and subsequent fires led to the collapse of the towers after terrorists flew jet fuel laden commercial airliners into the buildings; whether the fatalities were low or high, including an evaluation of the building evacuation and emergency response procedures; what procedures and practices were used in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the towers; and areas in current building and fire codes, standards, and practices that warrant revision.Also in this report is a description of how NIST reached its conclusions. NIST complemented in-house expertise with private sector technical experts; accumulated copious documents, photographs, and videos of the disaster; established baseline performance r of the WTC towers; performed computer simulations of the behavior of each tower onSeptember 11, 2001; combined the knowledge gained into a probable collapse sequence for each tower; conducted nearly 1,200 first-person interviews of building occupants and emergency responders; and analyzed the evacuation and emergency response operations in the two high-rise buildings.The report concludes with a list of 30 recommendations for action in the areas of increased structural integrity, enhanced fire endurance of structures, new methods for fire resistant design of structures, enhanced active fire protection, improved building evacuation, improved emergency response, improved procedures and practices, and education and training. [See details of these recommendations later in this chapter.]The report's complete \"Summary of Findings\" is Appendix 3-1 on the CD-ROM provided with this book.51 nIST nCSTAR 1: Federal Building and Fire Safety Investigation of the World Trade Center Disaster: Final Report on the Collapse of the World Trade Center Towers.

Washington, DC: national Institute of Standards and Technology, U.S. Department of Commerce; September 2005:xxxvi). Occupant Activity The Federal Building and Fire Safety Investigation of the World Trade Center Disaster: Final Report on the Collapse of the World Trade Center Towers revealed that although almost 3,000 people lost their lives at the WTC site on September 11, five times that many people from the WTC towers successfully evacuated the site. The report stated that Success in clearing a building in an emergency can be characterized by two quantities: the time people need to evacuate and the time available for them to do so. For the WTC Towers, the times available for escape were set by the collapse of the buildings. Neither the building occupants nor the emergency responders knew these times in advance. Moreover, the times were also three or four times shorter than the time needed to clear the tenant spaces of WTC 1 following the 1993 bombing.",

The blasts killed 202 people, including seven Americans, and injured as many as 350. Most of those killed and injured were foreign tourists. This bombing has been attributed to members of the Jemaah Islamiya (JI) terrorist organization, a Southeast Asian-based terrorist network with links to al-Qa'ida, which allegedly helped finance the attack. The Bali bombing may have been carried out in response to audiotaped appeals from Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Ladin and his senior deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri broadcast on the al-Jazeera network beginning on October 6, 2002, that urged renewed attacks on U.S. and Western interests. The FBI joined several other international antiterror agencies to assist Indonesia in the investigation of the attack. The investigation has yielded approximately 30 convictions overseas; including three suspects sentenced to death after being convicted of planning and carrying out the bombing. Notable among the convictions is Muslim cleric Abu Bakar Bashir, who is suspected of being the spiritual leader of JI. Bashir was sentenced in March The 9/11 Commission Report, Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States, investigation of \"facts and circumstances relating to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001\" by the national Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States (also known as the 9/11 Commission) (W.

Investigators believe JI militants Noordin Mohammad Top and bombmaker Azahari Husin were the masterminds behind the Bali nightclub attacks and several other Southeast Asian terrorist attacks. Husin was killed by Indonesian police during a shootout on November 9, 2005, in East Java, Indonesia. Top remained a fugitive at the end of 2005. 109 2002 Hotel Mombassa, Kenya November 28, 2002 in Mombasa, Kenya. Three suicide bombers crashed an SUV [sports utility vehicle] through a guard gate and onto the lobby steps of the Paradise Hotel, a seaside resort. Also, a surface-to-air missile was fired at an Israeli charter plane [carrying vacationers back to Israel] but it missed. The detonation of the vehicle killed 13 and injured 80. 110 2003 Residential Compounds, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia On the evening of May 12, 2003, al-Qa'ida operatives assaulted three residential compounds in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, that house Western guest workers. At least fifteen assailants in six vehicles, two vehicles at each location, participated in the attacks against the Al-Hamra Oasis Village, Jedawal compound, and Vinnell Company compound located in suburban Riyadh. After breaching manned security barriers at two of the three sites, the attackers detonated vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs) in the compounds, killing 35 people, including nine Americans, and injuring nearly 200 others. This assault followed a string of al-Qa'ida operations, including the August 7, 1998, East African embassy bombings; the October 12, 2000, bombing of the USS Cole in Aden, Yemen; the September 11, 2001, attack in the United States; and attacks on November 28, 2002, carried out against primarily Israeli targets in Mombasa, Kenya, involving simultaneous attacks against multiple targets. The May 12 attack reflected a high degree of planning, pre-operational surveillance, and coordination among teams-traditional hallmarks of al-Qa'ida operations. It also reflected a highly refined approach to suicide bombings that may have incorporated lessons learned from the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings and other attacks. Preliminary investigation indicates that operatives traveling in lead vehicles attacked guards at each of the sites with small arms fire and hand grenades to quickly breach gates and other security measures to gain access to the compounds. Once inside the compounds, assailants may also have fired weapons to draw the attention of residents to window areas to maximize casualties.

The blast killed 11 people, not including the suicide bomber, and injured 144 others, including two U.S. citizens. The blast caused extensive damage to the hotel and an adjacent office building. Investigation by the Indonesian National Police, the Australian Federal Police, and the FBI traced responsibility for the bombing to Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), a transnational Southeast Asian terrorist organization based in Indonesia with close links to al-Qa'ida, which helped to finance the bombing. The international investigation has identified over 30 individuals involved in the conspiracy to bomb the JW Marriott Hotel in Jakarta. Witness testimony has identified Noordin Mohammed Top as the leader of the operation and Dr. Azahari Husin as the bombmaker. Approximately 30 of the conspirators have been arrested, tried, and convicted in Indonesian courts and have received prison sentences ranging from three to 14 years. Husin was killed by Indonesian police during a shootout on November 9, 2005, in East Java, Indonesia. Top remained a fugitive at the end of 2005. The investigation into the bombing of the JW Marriott Hotel in Jakarta is ongoing. 112 2003 HSBC Bank and British Consulate, Istanbul, Turkey On November 20, as US President George W. Bush was in the United Kingdom meeting with Prime Minister Tony Blair, two truck bombs exploded. Suicide bombers detonated the vehicles at the HSBC Bank AS and the British Consulate, killing thirty people [various news sources quote numbers of fatalities varying from 27 to 30] and wounding 400 others. The bombers appeared to have waited for the traffic lights in front of the HSBC headquarters to turn red to maximize the effects. Several Britons were killed in the two attacks, including the top British official in Istanbul, consul general Roger Short, but most of the victims were Turkish Muslims\u2026. Police say that the bombers may have timed the attacks to coincide with Bush's visit to the UK. 113 Bin Laden allegedly planned [this] attack in Turkey. 114 msnbc.

On March 11, 2004, deadly bombings [of Madrid's train system during rush hour involved explosives contained in backpacks left on four commuter trains. The incidents] that left 191 dead and 1,824 injured in Madrid were one of the worst worldwide terror attacks since the September 11, 2001 strikes on New York and Washington. In addition to the carnage, the March 11, 2004 blasts targeting the Spanish city's train network caused major psychological and political fall-out. The country swiftly re-evaluated its contribution to U.S.-led global anti-terror operations. Three days after the attacks, blamed on Islamic militant groups including al-Qaeda, the then government was voted out of office. Its successors ended Spain's military involvement in Iraq. Meanwhile, Spain launched a massive manhunt for the perpetrators, eventually bringing 29 suspects to trial in February 2007. 115 A Spanish court Wednesday convicted 21 in the 2004 bombing of Madrid's train system, the deadliest terrorist attack in continental Europe. 116 2004 Offices and Residences, Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia r On the morning of May 29, 2004, terrorist attacks were carried out against at least three Western targets in the city of Al Khobar. Foreign Nationals, including Westerners, and Saudi citizens were killed in the attacks. Terrorists held around 50 people hostage in the offices and residences of foreign oil company employees in Al-Khobar. The attack began at 7.30 in the morning, when four attackers in army uniform attacked the APICORP compound, site of the headquarters of the Arab Petroleum Investment Corporation as well as its housing facilities. The perpetrators seemed to spare Muslims but not without advising them towards their ill-guided version of piety. The hostage crisis, which lasted for almost 25 hours, came to an end on 30 May 2004 when Saudi commandos rescued fifty people. Twenty-two people were killed by the terrorists which included eight Indians. 117 2005 London Transportation System On July 7, 2005, a series of coordinated suicide bomb blasts struck London's transport system during morning rush hour. Beginning at 8:50 a.m. three bombs exploded within 50 seconds of each other on three London Underground trains, and a fourth bomb exploded on a bus nearly an hour later at 9:47 a.m. in London's Tavistock Square. Fifty-two people were killed [including the four suicide bombers] and approximately 700 injured in the bombing. Among the casualties were one American killed and four wounded.

The Indian government accused Pakistan's military spy agency, the Inter Services Intelligence, of planning the July 11 Mumbai train bombings that killed 209 people\u2026. The bombs consisted of pressure cookers filled with ammonium nitrate and RDX, a base commonly used in military explosives\u2026. Roy [Indian police commissioner, A. N. Roy] said the Lashkar-e-Tayyaba, a banned terrorist group from Pakistan, and the Students Islamic Movement of India were part of the planning and carried out the attacks. 124 2007 London Incidents June 29, 2007, London Two car bombs were discovered and disabled before they could be detonated.

While they were there they noticed a Mercedes car parked outside the Tiger Tiger Club and noticed that there appeared to be smoke inside the vehicle. The police were called and the Metropolitan Police explosives officers went to the scene and examined the car. Inside they found significant quantities of petrol, gas cylinders, and I cannot at this stage tell you how much petrol because we have not yet have a chance to measure it precisely but what I can tell you is that it was in several large containers.

According to Stratfor, In July 1993, U.S. counterterrorism agents arrested eight individuals later convicted of plotting an elaborate, multistage attack on key sites in Manhattan. The militants, who were linked to Osama bin Laden's then-relatively new group, al Qaeda, planned to storm the island armed with automatic rifles, grenades and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). In multiple raids on key targets combined with diversionary attacks, they aimed to kill as many people as possible.The planned attack, which came to be known as the \"Landmarks\" plot, called for several tactical teams to raid sites such as the Waldorf-Astoria,St.  Regis and U.N. Plaza hotels, the Lincoln and Holland tunnels, and a midtown Manhattan waterfront heliport servicing business executives and VIPs traveling from lower Manhattan to various New York-area airports. The militants carried out extensive surveillance both inside and outside the target hotels using human probes, hand-drawn maps and video surveillance. Detailed notes were taken on the layout and design of the buildings, with stairwells, ballrooms, security cameras and personnel all reconnoitered.The attackers intended to infiltrate the hotels and disguise themselves as kitchen employees. On the day of the attack, one attack team planned to use stolen delivery vans to get close to the hotels, at which point heavily armed, small-cell commando teams would deploy from the rear of the van. Stationary operatives would use hand grenades to create diversions while attack teams would rake hotel guests with automatic weapons. The attackers planned to carry gas masks and use tear gas in hotel ballrooms to gain an advantage over any security they might come up against. They planned to attack at night, when the level of protection would be lower\u2026.A little more than fifteen years later, the Nov. 26 attacks in Mumbai closely followed the script of the New York plot. Militants armed with AK-47s, grenades and military-grade explosives carried out a very logistically sophisticated and coordinated attack on the financial capital of India.145",

            "text": "The following details of these incidents were obtained from Twin Towers by Angus Kress gillespie. 146 April 7, 1974, new york City-Starting at 7:15 AM, 24-year old French tightrope walker, Philippe Petit, walked back and forth seven or eight times on a tightrope cable stretched between the roofs of the 1,350-foot high Twin Towers. Three days before this heart-stopping display, Petit and three companions, all disguised as construction workers, used a freight elevator to transport cables and other equipment to the roof. On the night before the walk, they positioned themselves on each roof and used a five-foot crossbow to shoot an arrow, with a nylon fishing line attached, across from the north to the south Tower. Using the line, they then strung across a 131-foot cable and secured it in place. The next morning, Petit nonchalantly walked back and forth between the towers for nearly 75 minutes, stopping at times to sit down, lie down, and even hang from his feet. So many spectators gathered to watch that it caused a giant traffic jam on the streets below. Eventually, Petit was persuaded by a Port Authority police sergeant to come to the safety of the roof. July 22, 1975, new york City-A skydiver parachuted from the north tower roof to the plaza 1350 feet below. A New York Times reporter, Lee Dembart, described how it was accomplished: \"With his white parachute concealed in a green bag, 34-year old Owen J. Quinn, of 30-42 23rd Street, Astoria, eluded security guards on the 78th floor of the north tower, walked to the roof above the 110th floor, jumped off at 4:45 PM, and landed less than two minutes later on the raised ceremonial plaza between the buildings.\" 147 Apart from some cuts and bruises on his leg, caused by the wind blowing him into the side of the building, he landed safely. Quinn, who said that he was trying to draw attention to the plight of the poor, was booked on charges of criminal trespass and reckless endangerment. gillespie AK. Winning acceptance.

            "text": ", A Special Report by Dames and Moore/URS Corporation: Steel moment frame buildings have generally been considered very effective in resisting seismic forces. However, the high intensity of the Northridge earthquake pushed even steel moment frame buildings to their seismic limits, causing damage not experienced before. More than 50 relatively new 2-to 10-story structures that sustained brittle structural damage have been identified at the time of writing this report. Such damage raises troubling questions about the seismic resistance of this type of construction. Damage took the form of cracks in welds and rupture of steel sections at connections of beams to columns and columns to the base plate-both areas are critical for stability of the structure. Steel-framed buildings are designed to absorb energy by bending without breaking. However, the failure of welded connections would not allow the level of bending assumed in design and can cause brittle failures. Steel members in existing buildings are covered with fireproofing and are not readily available for inspection. Thus, damage caused by the quake may go unnoticed unless a detailed and costly inspection program is undertaken. The damage to steel moment frame buildings has potentially the highest structural significance of the Northridge earthquake and will probably result in substantial research and associated design code changes. 277 276 hall JF.

Tsunami damage does not result simply from inundation or the force of waves. Tsunamis transport debris fields that act as battering rams. Spontaneous dams form between obstructions and burst when water pressures build up behind them. The landscape they leave behind may be scoured of almost all evidence of human activity. Utilities like water, sewer, power, telephone, roads and bridges, ports and harbors are often destroyed, along with buildings. Damage is widespread, with long-term economic impacts on low-lying communities and coastal regions.299",

In Germany, a 2002 study estimated that more than 800,000 workers were the victims of mobbing. In Spain, an estimated 22 per cent of officials in public administration were victims of this form of violence. In France, reported acts of aggression against transport workers rose from 3051 in 2001 to 3185 in 2002. In Japan, 625,572 consultation requests were brought before court counsellors between April 2002 and March 2003 of which almost 32,000 (5.1 per cent) were related to harassment and bullying. This compares to data for April to September 2003 when 9.6 per cent of 51,444 requests concerned bullying and harassment. In Malaysia, 11,851 rape and molestation cases in the workplace were reported between 1997 and May 2001. Widespread sexual harassment and abuse were major concerns in a number of countries including South Africa, Ukraine, Kuwait and Hong Kong and China. Australia has estimated costs to employers to be between A$6 and 13 billion. Many countries have explicitly recognized violence in occupational health and safety legislation. Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Poland and Sweden are among countries that have recently adopted legislation or amended existing laws and regulations to address workplace violence.",

Establish procedures for investigating occupational injury or illness arising from a workplace assault or a threat of assault. Implement procedures to handle threats of violence by employees, including a policy on when to notify law enforcement agencies. Establish procedures to allow employees to confidentially report threats, and to protect them from physical retaliation for these reports. Provide training on how to recognize workplace security hazards, how to prevent workplace assaults, and what to do when an assault occurs, including emergency action and post emergency procedures. Give employees instruction in crime awareness, assault and rape prevention, and hostile situation diffusion. For example, if employees work late at night, encourage them to keep their doors locked, and either to leave the building with a fellow employee or to call security for an escort to their vehicle. If a workplace assault occurs, reduce the short-and long-term physical and emotional effects of the incident by providing post event trauma counseling to those who desire such intervention. 353",
