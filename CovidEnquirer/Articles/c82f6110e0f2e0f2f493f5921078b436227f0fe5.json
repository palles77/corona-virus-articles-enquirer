            "text": "The call for reviewing laws concerning infectious diseases is increasing in the UK 1 and this book extends the argument to a global level. Professor Fidler, a lawyer, from Middle America uses the recent outbreak of respiratory infection caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS) as a model for examining the rights and wrongs of current legal powers and how structures may change to encompass future threats. He parallels public health with international relations following the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, which ended the Thirty Years War. This landmark treaty enabled European states to overrule the views of a single country and laid the basis for future international relations and eventually the UN and World Health Organisation. I think this analogy is rather overplayed but the book does give some good historical insight into how countries have fought the threat of infections that cross their boundaries. The phrase 'germs are epidemiological phenomena; passports are political phenomena' is catchy but does not add to the commonly heard mantra that infectious diseases do not respect international boundaries. In the author's view 'Westphalian public health' is exemplified by the WHO International Health Regulations which were created in 1951 but have never worked and are increasingly abandoned by many countries failing to report outbreaks for fear of economic repercussions and richer countries using their own methods of surveillance and control. SARS nearly became a worldwide epidemic and the rise of new strains of influenza A virus present a possible major global emergency. In the post-SARS world international health relations have improved even if that cannot be said of political relations. The Chinese authorities appear to have learnt from their mistake in declaring SARS as a potential problem early enough to prevent spread via Hong Kong to many other countries in Asia and in particular to Canada. I recommend this book to anyone thinking about the barriers to communicable disease control across boundaries. We need to revisit the Public Health Act 1984 and the powers for quarantining contacts of cases of a highly infectious disease before it is too late.",

            "text": "There is now universal acceptance of the role of ethics in health practice. However, the content of health care ethics has not been universally agreed. This is not surprising given the broad range of health practices (primary care, community care, secondary care, emergency care, public health, health policy) and the broad range of practice disciplines, all of which raise different but equally complex moral questions and all of which have begun to develop discrete codes and guidelines to ethical practice. More worrying, however, is that the content of health care ethics tends to differ",
