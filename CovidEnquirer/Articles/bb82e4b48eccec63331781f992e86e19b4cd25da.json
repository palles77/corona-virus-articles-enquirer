            "text": "Background: Human rhinovirus (HRV) infections are highly prevalent, genetically diverse, and associated with both mild upper respiratory tract and more severe lower tract illnesses (LRTI). Objective: To characterize the molecular epidemiology of HRV infections in young children seeking acute medical care. Study design: Nasal swabs collected from symptomatic children <3 years of age receiving care in the Emergency and Urgent Care Departments at Seattle Children's Hospital were analyzed by a rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system (FilmArray \u00ae ) for multiple viruses including HRV/enterovirus. HRV-positive results were confirmed by laboratory-developed real-time reverse transcription PCR (LD-PCR). Clinical data were collected by chart review. A subset of samples was selected for sequencing using the 5 noncoding region. Associations between LRTI and HRV species and genotypes were estimated using logistic regression analysis. Results: Of 595 samples with HRV/enterovirus detected by FilmArray, 474 (80%) were confirmed as HRV by LD-PCR. 211 (96%) of 218 selected samples were sequenced; HRV species A, B, and C were identified in 133 (63%), 6 (3%), and 72 (34%), respectively. LRTI was more common in HRV-C than HRV-A illness episodes (adjusted OR [95% CI] 2.35[1. 03-5.35). Specific HRV-A and HRV-C genotypes detected in multiple patients were associated with a greater proportion of LRTI episodes. In 18 patients with >1 HRV-positive illness episodes, a distinct genotype was detected in each. Conclusion: Diverse HRV genotypes circulated among symptomatic children during the study period. We found an association between HRV-C infections and LRTI in this patient population and evidence of association between specific HRV genotypes and LRTI.",

Many of the repeated genotypes clustered temporally, indicating that specific genotypes may emerge and spread in a seasonal pattern. While all HRV-C genotypes detected in \u22654 patients were associated with LRTI in a majority of patients, the HRV-A genotypes displayed a wider range of disease severity with a subset of HRV-A genotypes associated with LRTI in a high percentage of patients. Our findings confirm that HRV-A should not be discounted as a potential cause of severe respiratory disease in children. A previous study classified specific HRV genotypes as either mild or severe and found that both HRV-A and -C genotypes caused severe disease [2] . In a study of adults with asthma, a minor group of HRV-A was more likely to cause asthma exacerbations [27] . Our results suggest genotype may be important in determining disease severity and further analysis is warranted.",

Few studies have analyzed sequential HRV illness episodes or long-term viral shedding, particularly in children [28] [29] [30] [31] . In a prospective study of 25 infants with multiple HRV illness episodes over a 2.5-year period, four had identical virus genotypes detected in sequential episodes separated by \u226514 days and extended shedding occurred for up to 50 days [29] . Our study did not prospectively follow patients and only included children with symptomatic disease that required acute care. Potentially, some patients experienced long-term shedding, but did not exhibit symptoms that prompted them to return to our ED. Furthermore, we were unable to assess duration of asymptomatic or total viral shedding. Our findings suggest that in an acute care setting, recurrent HRV infection of a single genotype in children is uncommon.",
