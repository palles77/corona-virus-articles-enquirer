Although all result in respiratory illness, little is known about how these subtypes infect differentiated airway epithelia. Therefore, we assayed A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), A/Japan/305/57 (H2N2), and X31 (H3N2) influenza virus strains for binding and infection on fully differentiated primary cultures of airway epithelia isolated from human bronchus, grown on semiporous filters at an air-liquid interface. In this model system, viral infectivity was highest when virus was applied to the apical versus the basolateral surface; Japan was most infectious, followed by PR8. The X31 strain showed very low levels of infectivity. Confocal microscopy and fluorescence-resonance energy transfer studies indicated that Japan virus could enter and fuse with cellular membranes, while infection with X31 virions was greatly inhibited. Japan virus could also productively infect human trachea explant tissues. These data show that influenza viruses with SA\u24232,3Gal binding specificity, like Japan, productively infect differentiated human airway epithelia from the apical surface. These data are important to consider in the development of pseudotyped recombinant viral vectors for gene transfer to human airway epithelia for gene therapy.",

To distinguish between viruses and cells, the rhodaminelabeled lipid probe Rh-PE was introduced into the viral envelope, and cellular membranes were labeled with F18 (fluorescein lipid probe). Thirty minutes after application of virus, cells were washed, fixed, and observed by confocal microscopy. The photomicrographs in Fig. 5 show an en face view (Figs. 5A and 5B) or x-z stacked series (Figs. 5C and 5D) from the acquired images of influenza virusinfected airway epithelia. Japan virions were noted both apically and internally (Fig. 5C ). In contrast, the X31 strain is localized to the apical surface only (Fig. 5D) . We next tested for evidence of fusion using the FRET assay. The assay was designed to test for FRET between the fluorescein label in cellular membranes and the rhodamine fluorophore in the viral envelopes. This process can take place only if the distance between the two dyes is in the range of 10 to 100 \u00c5 (35), as can be accomplished during membrane fusion processes. Figures 5E and 5F are representative of the level of FRET occurring in the presence of excitation of fluorescein only. FRET, detected as excitation of the Ph-RE label, was observed throughout the thickness of the culture after application of labeled Japan strain (Fig. 5E ). For cultures to which Rh-PE-labeled X31 was applied, FRET was rarely detected (Fig. 5F ).",

Thus qualitatively, in both the cell culture and the explant models, Japan and PR8 influenza strains were capable of infection, while X31 was not. The infection of the tracheal epithelium by Japan virus was also confirmed by immunostaining (Fig. 7) . Notably, only the apical surface was positive for influenza proteins.

However, our data show that influenza strains with preferential binding to SA\u24232,3Gal receptors productively infect human airway epithelia.

These data supported studies done by Liu (38) , showing binding of dye-labeled human isolates with SA\u24232,6Gal specificity to ciliated epithelia of the ferret trachea. Similar studies, using paraformaldehyde-fixed preparations of human trachea, confirmed binding of viruses with SA\u24232,6Gal specificity to ciliated cells (11) . Interestingly, the authors of this study also noted labeled virus with SA\u24232,6Gal specificity situated over goblet cells, but attributed this binding to tissue preparation artifact.

            "text": "Like Japan, X31 could bind to the apical surface of airway epithelia. However, it could not enter the cells; there was minimal evidence of membrane fusion within the cells as was found with the Japan strain, and there was little to no virus produced after 18 h of infection. The block in infection was not due to defective virus, since the titer in MDCK cells was similar to those of the other viruses tested. Also, we did not find an overall block in infection by other H3N2 strains with SA\u24232,6Gal specificity, since other H3N2 human isolates could productively infect human airway epithelia from the apical surface (39) . One possibility for the inability of the X31 strain to infect airway epithelia could be mutations within HA that do not alter binding specificity, but do inhibit interaction with a secondary receptor or entry of the virus into cells. Sequencing of the HA RNA encoding the HA1 subunit from X31 and A/Aichi/2/68 virions revealed only a conservative mutation: Ile 182 in Aichi to Val in X31 (data not shown). However, we cannot discount that mutations in HA2 or other proteins were responsible for the low infectious activity of X31 in airway epithelia. A second possibility may relate to the susceptibility of Japan or X31 HA to inactivation (40) . Work by Korte and colleagues demonstrated that X31 HA is more sensitive to inactivation after preincubation in low-pH buffer (pH 5.0 -5.2) than Japan virus. Those studies showed that a 10-min preincubation of X31 at pH 5.0 reduced the fusogenic capacity of the virus by 70%. Japan was more stable under these conditions. When similar experiments were done using PR8, the rate and extent of inactivation were greater than for X31. However, we noted that PR8 was more infections than X31 in airway epithelia, suggesting that inactivation of X31 HA may not be the sole determinant for its inability to infect airway epithelia in this study. Finally, the observed differences between the parent strains (PR8 and A/Aichi) and their reassortant (X31) could be due to altered interactions between surface glycoproteins derived from the H3N2 strain and the membrane proteins (M1 and M2) originating from H1N1 virus. How the requirements for these interactions would differ between kidney cells and airway epithelia is unclear at this time.",

We noted previously that entry of Moloney murine retrovirus vectors with amphotropic or xenotropic envelopes into human airway epithelia was restricted to the basolateral surface (21) . In contrast, influenza virus infection resulted from binding to the apical plasma membrane ((32) and this study), similar to coronavirus (42, 43) and measles virus (44) . Researchers investigating viral vectors for application to the treatment of cystic fibrosis have shown that one of the major limitations to infection of airway epithelia from the apical side is receptor inaccessibility (21) (22) (23) (24) . Recently, methods have been developed to transiently disrupt the tight junctions to allow envelope viruses access to all cell layers of the epithelia (45) . An alternative method to target retroviral vectors to airway epithelia from the mucosal side may be to pseudotype them with envelopes shown to allow for productive infection when applied to the apical surface. Our data suggest that Japan, but not X31, could be a candidate envelope protein for such an approach.",

Our data revealed interesting differences between X31 infectivity in MDCK vs airway epithelia and suggest that the block in X31 infection was due to inhibition of infection after binding to the cell surface. We demonstrate that Japan virus can bind and FIG. 6. Fluid-phase endocytosis in human airway epithelia infected with Japan or X31 strain of influenza virus. Influenza virus preparations were added to airway epithelia in the cold, followed by addition of a 37\u00b0C solution of FITC-dextran to detect fluid-phase endocytosis. After a 5-min incubation cells were fixed, stained with Texas red-labeled lectin to label the apical surface, and observed by confocal microscopy. The photomicrographs are a stacked x-z series. Background levels of endocytosis (not shown) in the absence of added virus were uniformly low as previously published (36) .",

Sections from control tissues, or mock-infected tissues, were negative (not shown). The arrow points to the apical side of tracheal epithelium. Nuclei were detected using DAPI staining. fuse with apical cellular membranes, increase fluid-phase endocytosis, and replicate in viable cultures of well-differentiated epithelia.
