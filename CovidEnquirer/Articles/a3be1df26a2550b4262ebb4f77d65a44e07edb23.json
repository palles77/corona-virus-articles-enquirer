            "text": "Background: Hospital emergency management plans are essential and must include input from an infection preventionist (IP). Multiple hospital planning documents exist, but many do not address infection prevention issues, combine them with noninfection prevention issues, or are disease/event specific. An all-encompassing emergency management planning guide for IPs is needed. Methods: A literature review and Internet search were conducted in December 2008. Data from relevant sources were extracted. A spreadsheet was created that delineated hospital emergency management plan components of interest to IPs. Results: Of the sources screened, 49 were deemed relevant. Eleven domains were identified: (1) having a plan; (2) assessing hospital readiness; (3) having infection prevention policies and procedures; (4) having occupational health policies and procedures; (5) conducting surveillance and triage; (6) reporting incidents, having a communication plan, and managing information; (7) having laboratory support; (8) addressing surge capacity issues; (9) having anti-infective therapy and/or vaccines; (10) providing infection prevention education; and (11) managing physical plant issues. Conclusion: Infection preventionists should use this article as an assessment tool for evaluating their hospital emergency management plan and for developing policies and procedures that will decrease the risk of infection transmission during a mass casualty event.",

Plan development and assessment is a multidisciplinary and multidepartmental endeavor that must include the input from an infection preventionist (IP). 1 For most hospitals, the Plan consists of multiple components: the main body of the plan that addresses emergency management tasks/needs that are applicable to all MCEs and a series of appendices or annexes that address specific incidents such as chemical, nuclear, or biologic events. Examples of allhazards components of the Plan include addressing liability issues for health care personnel, providing mental health support for disaster victims and hospital staff, and establishing funding to cover uncompensated costs during an MCE. Although these issues are very important to emergency management and may have an indirect impact on infection transmission during an MCE, ensuring these topics are addressed in a Plan will not fall within the scope of an IP's responsibility at most hospitals. Most IPs will act as a consultant to the hospital emergency management planning committee and will be responsible for assessing the Plan in regards to preventing infection transmission during MCEs. 1 IP involvement will be most important in developing and assessing the Plan's biologic annex.",

Plans need to have an appendix or annex that addresses biologic threats. In addition, there are infection prevention issues that must be addressed by the main component of the Plan, such as having infection prevention policies and procedures in place during any type of MCE. This article addresses all components of the Plan of interest to IPs: the biologic annex as well as the infection prevention issues that would be included in the main component of the Plan. IPs should use this article as a resource to assist in developing or assessing a hospital emergency management plan for infection prevention issues. There is no perfect Plan; the best plans are constantly under review and revision. Therefore, this article cannot provide information on best practices related to all aspects of infection prevention during emergency management. In addition, procedures that work in one hospital or region may not be applicable to all facilities. IPs should use this article to identify gaps in their hospital emergency management plan. Guidance on how to implement specific interventions, such as developing a policy on work quarantine or how to allocate limited amounts of respiratory protection, are provided in other documents. 6, 7 METHODS A literature review was conducted in December 2008 using the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Healthstar, Psych Info, and Medline databases for years 1966 through 2008. The following terms were utilized as key word searches: infection control, infection prevention, hospital, readiness, disaster plan, mass casualties, bioterrorism, pandemic, and emergency management. Only English language articles in peer-reviewed journals were utilized. An Internet search was also conducted in December 2008 using the same search terms as above to identify existing book chapters, reports from response agencies, published standards and guidelines, and other relevant materials related to the development of hospital emergency management plans to address biologic MCEs that were outside the peer-reviewed literature. Inclusion criteria included articles, planning documents, and published reports that addressed infection prevention issues that need to be included in a Plan. Articles that address community, public health, or personal preparedness were excluded. Also excluded were articles that only addressed noninfection prevention emergency management issues, such as developing policies and procedures for incorporating National Incident Management System (NIMS) terminology into the hospital emergency management plan. US-and non-US-based articles and documents/ reports were included in the analysis.",

For example, most national organizations recommend stockpiling of anti-infective therapy, vaccines, and personal protective equipment, but guidelines for how much of a stockpile are needed have not been developed. Researchers agree that surge capacity is needed for all types of mass casualty events, but the exact amount/ number of surge beds that need to be available for any given facility has not been outlined. 11, 16, 18 The number of airborne infection isolation rooms or negative-pressure surge capacity needed by a hospital and the most effective indicators for syndromic surveillance have also not yet been determined. Most researchers state that biologic scenarios should be used in hospital disaster exercises to evaluate hospital preparedness, and the Joint Commission requires hosting disaster exercises at least twice a year, 9 but the frequency with which biologic scenarios must be used in these drills has not been established.
