            "text": "Recent terrorist and epidemic events have underscored the potential for disasters to generate large numbers of casualties. Few surplus resources to accommodate these casualties exist in our current health care system. Plans for ''surge capacity'' must thus be made to accommodate a large number of patients. Surge planning should allow activation of multiple levels of capacity from the health care facility level to the federal level. Plans should be scalable and flexible to cope with the many types and varied timelines of disasters. Incident management systems and cooperative planning processes will facilitate maximal use of available resources. However, resource limitations may require implementation of triage strategies. Facility-based or ''surge in place'' solutions maximize health care facility capacity for patients during a disaster. When these resources are exceeded, community-based solutions, including the establishment of off-site hospital facilities, may be implemented. Selection criteria, logistics, and staffing of off-site care facilities is complex, and sample solutions from the United States, including use of local convention centers, prepackaged trailers, and state mental health and detention facilities, are reviewed. Proper pre-event planning and mechanisms for resource coordination are critical to the success of a response. The terrorist attacks of 2001 and the threat of large-scale infectious disease outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and pandemic influenza have revealed potentially large gaps in the ability of the health care system to find either the capacity or the special capabilities to cope with disasters that severely injure or infect a large number of victims. 1, 2 Although much current planning revolves around large-scale terrorist or epidemic events, the recent Rhode Island nightclub fire demonstrates that even a moderate-sized incident may generate large numbers of victims whose care requires supplemental staff and specialized resources and overwhelms local capabilities. 3 There is an urgent need for communities and regions, not just individual health care facilities, to develop tiered, scalable, and flexible surge capacity plans to provide care for a large volume of patients. These plans must reflect local hazards and other variables (eg, climate, travel and tourism patterns, population).",

However, the challenges of planning are many in the face of frequent emergency department (ED) crowding 5 and a loss of 38,000 hospital beds (4.4%) nationwide between 1996 and 2000, 6 including a 20% decrease in ICU capacity between 1995 and 2001. 7 This article reviews options for patient care surge capacity for hospital patients. These strategies do not exist in isolation but must be part of a comprehensive public health and emergency management plan for outpatient and inpatient care. In addition to the resources available to the authors, a MEDLINE search was conducted to identify articles of interest using search terms ''surge capacity,'' ''disasters + hospital,'' ''disaster planning + hospital,'' ''field hospital,'' and ''surge + disasters'' since 1966. Articles that seemed primarily related to surge capacity were reviewed and hand-searched for additional references.",

Most victims of chemical and explosion events will present within the first 6 hours to hospital EDs. 13 Rapid clearance of the ED is accomplished by expediting the disposition of patients and clearing the ED of ambulatory patients. Elective procedures and admissions should be held or cancelled. The facility may elect a graded response, which provides for different actions to be taken according to the number of casualties expected. According to the type of incident, additional emergency patient screening areas may be required if the volume of patients overwhelms the resources of the ED. 14 Each inpatient unit may be assigned by the disaster plan to automatically accept a predetermined number of patients from the ED who do not yet have beds (eg, 2 per nursing unit, or 110% unit census). Health care facilities should be prepared to discharge inpatients to make beds available for incoming casualties. The discharge function should receive immediate attention when the health care facility disaster plan is activated. Identification of patients eligible for early discharge is an inexact science, but patients who are clinically stable and whose inpatient requirements are limited to a few parenteral medications may be appropriate candidates. Preplanning with ancillary health care services (eg, nursing homes, home health) is essential for these early discharges. A discharge holding area (eg, lounge, cafeteria area) may allow these patients to be moved from their rooms while awaiting appropriate transportation, home care, and pharmacy arrangements.",

Inova Health System's 4 hospitals in northern Virginia, for example, made 343 additional beds (of 1,500 total) and 43 operating rooms available within 3 hours of the 2001 Pentagon attack. The District of Columbia made available 200 beds from their existing 2,904 staffed beds. Thus, for any given facility, surge capacity planning should incorporate the availability of about 20% to 30% of operating beds for immediate or near-term patient use. Some institutions may have significantly different numbers according to their elective admission rates, critical case resources, and availability of additional staffed beds. ICU bed availability is likely to be significantly lower. Key community and regional stakeholders. ",

Because of limited available surplus resources, 35 developing significant surge capacity while maintaining usual standards of care may be difficult, especially for critical care and isolation capacity. Current federal hospital funding programs will not provide a significant increase in capacity. For example, the amount of funding received by the average hospital under the current Health Resources and Services Administration grant will not purchase the equipment in use in a single critical care room or pay to retrofit one airborne infection isolation room. Thus, creative use of ''low-tech'' solutions is required and may provide efficient care but will not meet the quotidian standard of care (eg, using pulse oximetry and inexpensive oxygen-flow ventilators rather than standard ICU equipment or using inexpensive in-room high-efficiency particulate air filtration rather than purpose-built isolation rooms). Considering dual use in future facility planning (eg, building oxygen supply into meeting rooms) has been explored in limited settings 36 and would be of great benefit but often is cost prohibitive.",

Triage of resources will have to occur, and patients will be provided with an adjusted standard of care. This standard may evolve during an incident. It is critical that the public understand that preparedness does not necessarily equate to availability of standard medical care during a disaster. Although triage concepts have been discussed in the medical literature, [38] [39] [40] operational systems for health care facility-based triage, particularly of inpatients, are lacking.
