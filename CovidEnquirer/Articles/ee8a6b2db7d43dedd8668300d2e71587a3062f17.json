The onset, duration, intensity and geographical spread of influenza activity are unpredictable and depend on multiple factors such as the characteristics of virus strains, population susceptibility and climatic and environmental factors. 11 High-quality influenza surveillance can inform vaccine decision-making and help policy-makers prioritise resources for persons most at risk of severe outcomes. Timely detection of the onset of epidemics has the potential to inform empirical antiviral therapy for hospitalised patients with suspected influenza, 12 which can further reduce the health and economic burden of influenza.

In the last two decades, Serfling-based models and dynamic linear models requiring only recent data [13] [14] [15] [16] have been used for this purpose. Most of these models are based on time series methods, and they often use subjective criteria, such as a discretional virus isolations rate or manual removal of epidemic peaks, to establish a non-epidemic period. [17] [18] [19] In the United States, for instance, periods with <10% of specimens testing positive for influenza are considered non-epidemics periods 20 and have been used to establish national and regional baselines. Cowling et al. 21 estimated the sensitivity, specificity and the timeliness of an influenza alert, taking the period where the isolation rate was above a 20% as epidemic. Regardless of the method used, some important issues remain unresolved such as the evaluation of the validity of a given method in the absence of a gold standard or how to handle the early warning signals from statistical surveillance systems. 22 Nowadays, influenza sentinel networks exist at regional and national levels in most of Europe, optimising surveillance through the integration of epidemiological and virological data with high sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and timeliness. 23 However, these systems, which are based on the epidemiological surveillance of patients attending primary healthcare services, lack clear criteria to detect the start of the influenza epidemic and to assess the intensity and spread of influenza. Attempts at searching for a standard epidemic threshold have not satisfied all expectations 24, 25 or are difficult to apply worldwide, because of the complexity of the mathematical modelling and the variety of criteria to calculate the baseline or epidemic threshold. An automated method using simple data is needed to define the onset of the seasonal epidemic and to assess the intensity of influenza activity.",

The main purpose of the method is to define the baseline influenza activity in historical data and to establish an epidemic threshold above which the weekly rates are considered to be in the epidemic period. In this study, we describe the epidemic threshold, three thresholds for different levels of intensity calculated by MEM, the modelled 2009-2010 season, and we evaluate the performance of the epidemic threshold for detecting the start of the influenza epidemic in 19 European countries.",

The epidemic threshold is an ILI or ARI rate above which we define the start of the seasonal epidemic. The model was primarily developed to model influenza epidemics but, in order to ascertain its practical usefulness to calculate the threshold in 'real world' settings, we have applied the MEM to 20 data sets from 19 countries in the WHO European region with a diversity of surveillance systems and data types. While MEM performance varied considerably in different scenarios, the method generally produced a robust and specific signal to detect influenza epidemics and assessed the impact of seasonal respiratory infections in countries where only ARI data were available.",

            "text": "Unlike other methods, 16, 20, 24 the MEM does not include virological data. Influenza detection rates vary across the European Region depending on methods and practices in different countries (some of which have limited laboratory capacity) and may be less standardised than epidemiological measures for routine detection of the beginning of the influenza season. Influenza viruses circulate in a population at very low levels even outside of the influenza season and sporadic isolations may also have a little epidemic significance. As some countries within the European Region may not have influenza sentinel surveillance systems, viruses reported from out-of-season outbreaks investigations could also reduce the specificity of the method to detect the actual start of a season. Moreover, low-intensity epidemics in rural areas with limited laboratory capacity could delay the first detection of influenza for weeks in some countries. This suggests that a model using only simple epidemiological data might be a more practical choice for a standard within a region. Nevertheless, historical ILI and ARI data should be carefully checked to eliminate the data errors or aberrant information causing peaks in the pre-epidemic and post-epidemic periods. Notwithstanding, if influenza weekly epidemiological data are accompanied by timely virological data, virus circulation should be taken into account to make appropriate public health decisions. Hashimoto et al. 32 have explored the detection of epidemics in their early stage and defined periods of no activity and pre-epidemic periods, but the threshold and limits were not modelled based on the duration and intensity of historic influenza epidemics, and the alert status varied significantly depending of the arbitrary thresholds used. 33 Cowling et al. 21 suggested that the influenza surveillance systems should incorporate a simple and reliable model with maximum sensitivity and specificity, and a minimum lag in detecting epidemics. While no system can optimise each of these attributes, influenza surveillance through well-run sentinel networks has proven its utility and valid-ity, and strongly enhanced the value of predictive models. The routine collection of a limited amount of high-quality data in sentinel systems improves the sensitivity and specificity in comparison with compulsory and other non-sample systems. 34 The MEM epidemic threshold has a sensitivity of 75AE7% for ILI data and a very high specificity (overall more than 95% for ILI and ARI data). The epidemic threshold estimated by the MEM is conservative. Specificity is a more important attribute for the detection of an influenza epidemic than sensitivity, because the announcement of the start of influenza epidemic can generate media interest and triggers influenza prevention and control measures such as antiviral use, enhancements of vaccination campaigns or the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions. When the epidemic alert signal is excessively specific, the detection lag increases and reduces timeliness, as observed in Albania. The NPV increases in the pre-epidemic period, when incidence is lower. Conversely, the positive predictive value of MEM was observed to be highest during the epidemic period. The MEM seeks to achieve a balance between these values, as shown in Belgium and Slovenia (where values >95% were observed in both attributes), because it is this transition point from the pre-epidemic to the epidemic period where values are more relevant. Timeliness is higher in ARI data than ILI data, but this difference is not statistically significant, probably due to the sample size.",

ARI data from Albania and Romania did not present a typical epidemic wave but an increase in consultation rates with several peaks, while the Russian Federation showed high post-epidemic rates. Despite the differences between ILI and ARI, the only statistic that we observed to be significantly different between ILI and ARI systems is positive predictive value.
