Their restricted distribution and small population size make the island fox (Urocyon littoralis) particularly vulnerable to catastrophic events such as disease epidemics. Island foxes are a diminutive relative of the mainland gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), found only on six of the eight Channel Islands located off the coast of Southern California, USA Fig. 1) . The islands range from 37 km 2 to 249 km 2 in area and are located between 30 and 98 km away from the mainland (Philbrick, 1967) . The islands inhabited by foxes are San Miguel (SMI; 33\u00b002 0 N, 120\u00b018 0 W), Santa Rosa (SRI; 33\u00b057 0 N, 120\u00b006 0 W), Santa Cruz (SCZ; 34\u00b00 0 N, 119\u00b045 0 W), Santa Catalina (SCA; 33\u00b024 0 N, 118\u00b024 0 W), San Clemente (SCI; 32\u00b055 0 N, 118\u00b030 0 W) and San Nicolas (SNI; 33\u00b014 0 N, 119\u00b030 0 W). Island foxes are the largest indigenous terrestrial mammal in these unique ecosystems and are distributed as six genetically and morphologically distinct island subspecies (Collins, 1982; Wayne et al., 1991) . Island foxes co-exist and may compete for resources with a smaller endemic carnivore, the island spotted skunk (Spilogale gracili amphiala) on SCZ and SRI (Crooks and Van Vuren, 1995) . Feral cats (Felis catus) are present on the three southern islands (SNI, SCI, and SCA). Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) are commonly found only on SCA (which has a resident human population and seasonal tourists), but dogs have been present on most islands as pets or working dogs in recent history and their remains have been found at native American archeological sites on all six islands (Collins, 1982; Schoenherr et al., 1999) .",

To safeguard remaining foxes and augment natural recruitment, the entire wild populations of SMI and SRI, and a portion of the populations of SCA and SCZ were placed into captive breeding programs with the intent of releasing foxes back into the wild after mortality factors were identified and mitigated. Although golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) predation was identified as the principal cause of mortality on SCZ, SRI and SMI (Coonan et al., 2005; Roemer, 1999; Roemer et al., 2001) , the threat of infectious diseases following the decline needed to be assessed. The vulnerability of island foxes to infectious disease was realized in 1999 when canine distemper virus (CDV) was suspected to cause a rapid population decline on SCA. Approximately 90% of the wild fox population on the eastern two-thirds of the island disappeared, leaving fewer than 150 known individuals (Timm et al., 2000) . Distemper virus was confirmed in the only fox carcass available (Munson, L., unpublished) . Concerns for future epidemics led to a re-assessment of pathogen exposure in the island fox.",

            "text": "Prior to the population decline in the 1990s, there were few investigations of pathogen exposure in the island fox population. In 1973 antibodies to San Miguel sea lion virus (SMSLV) were detected in 6 of 85 (7%) SCZ foxes, thereby extending the host range for marine caliciviruses to canids (Prato et al., 1977) . Foxes were presumably exposed to SMSLV through scavenging on beaches occupied by infected pinnipeds (Moore and Collins, 1995; Prato et al., 1977) . A second survey of 100 SCZ foxes in 1973 did not detect antibodies against CDV, rabies, or leptospirosis, therefore Laughrin, (1977) cautioned that island foxes were at risk from health hazards presented by abandoned cats and dogs, and from bat species moving between the islands and the mainland. All six fox populations were surveyed in 1988 for exposure to CDV, canine parvovirus (CPV), canine adenovirus (CAV), canine coronavirus (CCV), canine herpesvirus (CHV), Toxoplasma gondii and Leptospira interrogans (Garcelon et al., 1992) . No antibodies against CDV were detected, but foxes on all six islands were exposed to CPV, with prevalence ranging from 5% to 59%. Exposure to CAV was common (72-97%), but absent in foxes on SCA and SCZ. Antibodies to CCV were found on only two islands, while CHV antibodies were found in a small number of foxes. Antibodies to the protozoal parasite, Toxoplasma gondii were present on all islands but SMI in 1988, and Leptospira interrogans serovar icterohaemorrhagiae antibodies were detected only on SCZ (Garcelon et al., 1992) . A subsequent survey conducted during the northern island fox population decline (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) on SMI, SCZ and SCI detected fewer foxes exposed to CPV compared to 1988 and documented the new presence of CAV antibodies in 58% of SCZ foxes sampled (Roemer et al., 2001) . The emergence of CAV on SCZ may have occurred via domestic dog contact or via spillover from the sympatric population of island spotted skunk. Immediately following the 1999 SCA fox decline, a survey of foxes detected CDV antibodies, including high titers suggestive of recent infection (Timm et al., 2000) . Preliminary surveillance of sympatric feral cats detected CDV antibodies, suggesting spillover of CDV into this species (Timm et al., 2000) .",

This survey was considered critical to ensure the health of foxes in captivity and to identify threats on islands where fox populations remained in the wild or would be released from captive breeding programs. Furthermore, the dramatic population declines and the subsequent placement of island foxes into captive breeding facilities may have altered the ecology of pathogens in island foxes through reduced acquired immunity or increased pathogen concentration at the sites of captive breeding. To address these concerns, exposure to selected infectious disease agents that could threaten fox persistence was examined by conducting a systematic serologic survey of foxes and sympatric feral cats for antibodies against pathogens known to infect canids. Feral cats were also surveyed for exposure to feline-specific diseases that cause immune suppression and thereby increase the susceptibility of cats to infection with canid pathogens.",

Capture locations were recorded using handheld global positioning system units (Garmin 12XL, Garmin, Olathe, KS, USA; UTM, NAD 27 CONUS 11).

Blood samples (up to 10 cc) were collected by femoral venipuncture using a 12-or 6-cc syringe and 22-gauge needle. Whole blood was placed into collection tubes with no anticoagulant, allowed to clot at room temper-ature, then serum obtained by centrifugation. Serum was frozen at 6\u00c040\u00b0C until analysis.",

Birthplace (wild or captivity) was noted for foxes being held in captivity. Age class was determined for wild-caught foxes using tooth eruption and wear pattern of the first upper molar (Wood, 1958) . Actual or minimum estimated age in years was recorded for foxes sampled in captivity. No foxes younger than five months of age were sampled to eliminate the possibility of maternal antibody interference with test results. Fox age was classified as young (age class 0-1 or <2 years of age) or adult (age class 2-4 or >2 years of age) for statistical analyses, and both age classes were well represented, with 56% of the samples from young and 44% from adult foxes. The sex ratio of wild foxes sampled was approximately 1:1 (52% male: 48% female). Individual foxes were sampled only once throughout their lifetime. If multiple serum samples existed for certain individuals, a single sample was selected based upon the serum volume available. No previously vaccinated foxes were sampled. In order to determine possible disease risks from feral cats to island foxes, frozen archived sera from 92 feral cats collected between 2001 and 2003 on SNI (n = 8), SCI (n = 21) and SCA (n = 63) were tested for feline and canine pathogen exposure.

Serum samples from foxes on all six islands collected between 2001 and 2002 were assayed for antibodies against CDV, CAV, CCV and CHV, using serum neutralization (SN) tests (Appel and Robson, 1973) ; CPV using a hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) test (Carmichael et al., 1980) (positive titer P 1:10); and six Leptospira interrogans serovars (icterohaemorrhagiae, pomona, canicola, hardjo, grippotyphosa, and bratislava) using the microagglutination (MIA) test (Cole et al., 1973 ) (positive titer P 1:100). For CDV, the Onderstepoort viral strain was inoculated onto Vero cells. Positive antibody titers P 1:16 were considered indicative of previous CDV exposure, while positive antibody titers P 1:8 but <1:16 were classified as suspect. This test cutoff for island foxes was based on replicate testing of samples (n = 26 replicates) and performance of the Cornell CDV SN assay on serum from vaccinated foxes. For CAV, CCV and CHV, antibody titers P 1:8 were considered positive. Fox samples were also tested for antibodies to the protozoal parasites Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum at the University of California, Davis (California, USA) using an indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) (Miller et al., 2001 ) with a 1:100 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-dog or goat-anti cat (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA, USA). Fluorescence at a titer P 1:640 was considered positive. The number of fox samples analyzed for each pathogen varied due to limited ser-um volume. Serum collected in 2003 from wild foxes on SCZ, SCA, SCI and SNI was tested for CDV, CAV, CPV, T. gondii and N. caninum antibodies, while 1988 fox samples were examined for CDV antibody only.",

''Equivocal'' samples were classified as ''positive'', and ''high negative'' samples were classified as ''negative'' for statistical analysis, as previous work has shown that the majority of cats testing ''equivocal'' are actually positive for FIV; and cats testing ''high negative'' are usually negative on confirmatory Western blot testing (Barr et al., 1991) .

Regression model variables were selected based on univariate analysis and likelihood ratio (LR) tests while overall model fit was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test statistic (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 2000) . The strength of associations were estimated using logistic odds ratios (OR) and 95% binomial confidence intervals (Long and Freese, 2001) . For v 2 and Fisher exact tests, odds ratios and 95% exact binomial confidence intervals (95%CI) were estimated using EpiInfo software (Mehta et al., 1985) .

The placement of large numbers of remaining foxes into captivity, while critical for recovery efforts, further exacerbated the risk that disease could cause significant mortality or inhibit reproduction and eventual recovery.

            "text": "Five of the six island fox populations have been exposed to canine distemper virus and exposure appears to have occurred only in the wild. The existence of CDV-antibody positive and suspect young foxes on SCA, SNI and SCZ for three consecutive years indicates that some foxes were recently exposed to distemper in the absence of detectable mortality in radio-collared individuals and recovered carcasses. This apparent survival of exposed foxes contrasts with the high mortality suspected to be caused by CDV in 1999 on SCA (Timm et al., 2000) . Mortality rates from CDV may differ among populations because of the genetic resistance of the host, virulence of CDV strains (Lednicky et al., 2004) , or co-infection with other pathogens such as CPV or T. gondii. Concurrent CDV and toxoplasmosis has caused mortality in gray foxes (Davidson et al., 1992; Kelly and Sleeman, 2003) , and other pathogens including rabies, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes and Cryptosporidium sp. have also occurred concurrent with distemper in gray foxes (Black et al., 1996; Davidson et al., 1992; Hoff et al., 1974) . Additionally, the abundance of domestic dogs on SCA increases the risk of a more virulent CDV strain being transmitted from dogs to foxes. These patterns of CDV infection in island foxes mirror the situation in African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus), where fatal CDVepidemics have occurred (Alexander et al., 1996) , yet other populations have had up to 24% of wild dogs exposed to CDV without clinical disease (Creel et al., 1997) . Epidemic cycles of CDV are common in raccoons and gray foxes when the number of susceptible (i.e. unexposed) individuals becomes high (Hoff et al., 1974; Roscoe, 1993) . Accordingly, the absence of CDV-antibody positive young foxes all three years on SCI suggests recent exposure may not be occurring and that an increasing proportion of the population is susceptible.",

The most likely reason for this discrepancy is higher test sensitivity of the Cornell SN assay, allowing the detection of low level antibody titers that were not detectable previously. False positive results could be due to non-specific antibody binding, but if this had occurred, all foxes tested would be expected to have some level of background activity in the assay. Although the occurrence of false positive results cannot be definitively ruled out, we carefully scrutinized positive test results, ruled out cross-reactions with closely related morbilliviruses, and evaluated assay performance on island foxes pre-and postvaccination to ensure the test was discriminating between negative and positive results for the same individuals. Additionally, the long-term storage of the 1988 samples (likely reducing detectable antibody levels) and our conservative test cutoff make it even more unlikely that these are false positive results. Concerns that the high test sensitivity of the Cornell SN assay may over-estimate exposure to CDV were the reason for our designating a large proportion of population as CDVantibody suspect. If suspect results represent true CDV exposure, there would be further evidence that CDV is endemic across most islands. Re-analyzing the 1988 fox samples with the more sensitive assay allowed us to compare our study results directly with samples from before the decline and document a previous exposure to canine distemper virus. It is possible that a low pathogenicity island-fox adapted CDV strain evoking low antibody titers evolved and now circulates among island foxes without the continued presence of domestic dogs.",

However, in domestic dogs, previous vaccination does not guarantee protection from an overwhelming viral infection or challenge with a highly pathogenic CDV strain (Greene and Appel, 1998) . All but one CDV-antibody positive island fox in our study had natural exposure titers of less than 1:100; similarly low level antibody titers (<1:100) occur in island foxes after CDV vaccination (Timm et al., 2000) . Due to concerns about the lack of CDV exposure in captive-born foxes and that a strain of CDV more pathogenic to foxes might be introduced, all foxes in captivity (including those foxes subsequently released from captivity) are now vaccinated with a canary-pox vectored CDV vaccine shown to be safe for use in this species (Timm et al., 2000) . Recently a sub-set of the wild populations on SCA, SCZ, and SCI also were opportunistically vaccinated against CDV due to the critically low population numbers left in the wild (Coonan, 2003) . Although vaccination interferes with our ability to discern whether CDV is endemic or epidemic, the need to protect the small number of remaining foxes from extinction warrants this intervention for the most at-risk populations.",

Domestic dogs and coyotes are the only known species capable of shedding N. caninum oocysts (Gondim et al., 2004b; Lindsay et al., 1999) but antibodies have been found in multiple wildlife species including gray foxes (Lindsay et al., 2001) , gray wolves (Canis lupus), coyotes, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and moose (Alces alces), suggesting a cervid-canid sylvatic cycle (Dubey et al., 1999a; Gondim et al., 2004a; Lindsay et al., 1996) .

On the California Channel Islands there is also risk of generalist pathogens like CDV spilling over from foxes or dogs into sympatric marine mammal populations, as was observed in Lake Baikal (Phoca sibirica) and Caspian seals (Phoca caspica) (Grachev et al., 1989; Kennedy et al., 2000) .

The presence of CDV antibodies in two feral cats on SCA likely occurred via spillover from foxes or dogs. The two CDV-antibody positive cats were also exposed to FIV and FeLV, possibly making these individuals more susceptible to CDV infection. Exposure to CDV in feral and domestic cats has been previously reported (Appel et al., 1974; Ikeda et al., 2001 ), but it is not known whether cats that are immunocompromised due to FeLV or FIV infection are capable of shedding CDV into the environment. However, immunocompromised cats are vulnerable to other opportunistic diseases, including toxoplasmosis (Hoover and Mullins, 1991; Lin et al., 1992; Pedersen and Barlough, 1991) . Foxes living on islands with feral cats have the opportunity to ingest T. gondii oocysts in cat feces, in addition to the tissue cysts in prey items (Tenter et al., 2000) . The documentation of greater mortalities with concurrent distemper and T. gondii infection in gray foxes and domestic dogs provides support for controlling cats to reduce the numbers of infectious oocysts that are shed into the environment.",

While caliciviruses have been shown to infect a variety of hosts and could possibly be passed between cats and foxes (Smith et al., 1998) , the inverse relationship between fox and cat calicivirus exposure in our study and the presence of calicivirus antibodies in foxes on islands without cats suggests this interaction is not necessary for fox infection. Given our results, it is likely that the biggest threat to island foxes from feral cats is competition.",

            "text": "Due to their inherently small population sizes and limited geographic distribution, island foxes will always be vulnerable to stochastic events, including disease outbreaks. Previous studies and anecdotal reports from island residents suggest that fox population sizes fluctuated widely in the past (Laughrin, 1980) . Island foxes can occur at much higher densities than gray foxes (3-14/km 2 vs. 0.4/km 2 ) which may increase the rate of pathogen transmission between susceptible animals (Garcelon and Schmidt, 2005; Grinnell et al., 1937; Laughrin, 1980) . During the 1970s, fox numbers and density remained very low (0.5 foxes/km 2 ) on SCA. Additionally, a dramatic decrease in foxes trapped (from 24 to 2) and fox density (11 foxes/km 2 to 2 foxes/km 2 ) occurred on SNI between 1971 and 1974, and further decreased (3 foxes, 0.5 foxes/km 2 ) in 1977 (Laughrin, 1980 ). Laughrin's data correlates well with recent work examining major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene diversity in island foxes, which suggests that the current degree of genetic monomorphism at neutral loci and high MHC gene variation in SNI foxes resulted from an extreme population bottleneck occurring between 20 and 40 years ago and resulting in less than 10 individuals (Aguilar et al., 2004) . Although speculative, an infectious disease outbreak on SNI similar to what was observed on SCA in 1999 could explain the dramatic decrease in fox numbers observed by Laughrin, and resulted in the population bottleneck described by Aguilar and colleagues. Strong selection for resistance to CDV, as a result of previous epidemics, could explain the relatively high CDV exposure prevalence in the absence of clinical disease in some island fox populations today. Even though our study suggests that CDV is endemic in some island fox populations, the recent suspected epidemic on SCA and the cyclical nature of CDV epidemics in other naturally exposed wildlife populations support concerns that island foxes are at risk from fatal epidemics of canine distemper. The continued presence of domestic dogs (whether constant or sporadic) on the California Channel Islands poses a risk to island foxes. In addition to dogs, the presence of introduced feral cats on three islands and the endemic island spotted skunk on two islands may pose some disease risk to foxes, as pathogens such as distemper and rabies could circulate among sympatric carnivores on the island.",

Accordingly, foxes in captivity should be vaccinated for the most potentially dangerous pathogens (CDV and rabies) to avoid release of a totally na\u00ef ve captive-born population. Vaccination of a portion of the wild foxes against CDV and rabies should also be considered where the remaining wild populations are at critically low numbers. If possible, efforts should be made to allow natural cycling of less pathogenic viruses already in the ecosystem to help protect against future epidemics, as long-term vaccination of island foxes will likely become impractical once populations have recovered. The suspected susceptibility to CDV and absence of documented morbidity or mortality in foxes exposed to other pathogens strongly argue for continued intensive disease surveillance. This surveillance will provide the basis for management decisions on all the islands, especially during active recovery efforts.",

During a suspected disease epidemic, data from sick or dead animals are often incomplete as these individuals are difficult to detect and recover. Pathogen exposure can usually be determined in live animals, but must be interpreted with caution as exposure may not cause clinical illness or mortality. The development of sensitive diagnostic methods increases our ability to detect pathogen exposure in wild populations, a critical first step towards understanding disease risks to threatened species. By examining the relationship between pathogen exposure and spatial, temporal, and population demographic factors, along with multi-species host transmission dynamics, we can better understand the epidemiology of diseases and provide objective data on which to base conservation management decisions.
