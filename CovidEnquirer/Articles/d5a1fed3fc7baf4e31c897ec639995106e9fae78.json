            "text": "The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 31 infection in Wuhan, China has posed a serious threat to global public health. To 32 develop specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics, the molecular 33 mechanism that underlies viral infection must first be confirmed. Therefore, we herein 34 used a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-mediated cell-cell fusion assay and found that 35 SARS-CoV-2 showed plasma membrane fusion capacity superior to that of 36 SARS-CoV. We solved the X-ray crystal structure of six-helical bundle (6-HB) core 37 of the HR1 and HR2 domains in SARS-CoV-2 S protein S2 subunit, revealing that 38 several mutated amino acid residues in the HR1 domain may be associated with 39 enhanced interactions with HR2 domain. We previously developed a pan-coronavirus 40 fusion inhibitor, EK1, which targeted HR1 domain and could inhibit infection by 41 divergent human coronaviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We 42 then generated a series of lipopeptides and found that the EK1C4 was the most potent 43 fusion inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and 44 pseudovirus infection with IC 50 s of 1.3 and 15.8 nM, about 241-and 149-fold more 45 potent than that of EK1 peptide, respectively. EK1C4 was also highly effective 46 against membrane fusion and infection of other human coronavirus pseudoviruses 47 tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as SARSr-CoVs, potently 48 inhibiting replication of 4 live human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. 49 Intranasal application of EK1C4 before or after challenge with HCoV-OC43 protected 50 mice from infection, suggesting that EK1C4 could be used for prevention and 51 treatment of infection by currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and emerging 52 SARSr-CoVs. 53 including 2,618 deaths, were reported in China and 27 other countries 11 , posing a 70 serious threat to global public health and thus calling for the prompt development of 71 specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics for treatment and prevention 72 of COVID-19. 73 Coronaviruses (CoVs), the largest RNA viruses identified so far, belonging to the 74 Coronaviridae family, are divided into 4 genera, \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b4-and \u03b3-coronaviruses, while 75 the \u03b2-coronaviruses are further divided into A, B, C, and D lineages. The seven CoVs 76 that can infect humans (HCoVs) include HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 in the 77 \u03b1-coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 in the \u03b2-coronaviruses lineage A, 78 SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the \u03b2-coronaviruses lineage B (\u03b2-B coronaviruses), 79 and MERS-CoV in the \u03b2-coronaviruses lineage C 6 . To develop specific SARS-CoV-2 80 fusion inhibitors, it is essential to study the fusion capacity of SARS-CoV-2 compared 81 to that of SARS-CoV. Particularly, the spike (S) protein S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2, We have solved the X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2's 6-HB core and 111 identified several mutated amino acid residues in HR1 domain responsible for its 112 enhanced interactions with HR2 domain. By conjugating the cholesterol molecule to 113 the EK1 peptide, we found that one of the lipopeptides, EK1C4, exhibited highly 114 potent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated membrane fusion and PsV 115 infection, about 240-and 150-fold more potent than EK1 peptide, respectively. 116 EK1C4 is also highly effective against in vitro and in vivo infection of some live 117 HCoVs, such as SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV, suggesting potential for 118 further development as pan-CoV fusion inhibitor-based therapeutics and prophylactics 119 for treatment and prevention of infection by the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 120 and MERS-CoV, as well as future reemerging SARS-CoV and emerging 121 SARSr-CoVs. 122 Results 123 The capacity of SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion 124 From the GISAID Platform (https://platform.gisaid.org), we obtained the 125 full-length amino-acid sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (BetaCoV 2019-2020) S protein 126 (GenBank: QHD43416). Through alignment with SARS-CoV and SL-CoVs S 127 proteins, we located the functional domains in SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which 128 contains S1 subunit and S2 subunit with the cleavage site at R685/S686 15 . S1 subunit 129 is located within the N-terminal 14-685 amino acids of S protein, containing 130 N-terminal domain (NTD), receptor binding domain (RBD), and receptor binding 131 motif (RBM). S2 subunit contains fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat 1 (HR1), heptad 132 repeat 2 (HR2), transmembrane domain (TM) and cytoplasmic domain (CP) (Fig. 1b) .",

Shortly thereafter, a novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, as denoted by WHO 3 , 62 was identified as the pathogen causing the coronavirus disease COVID-19 4,5 . 63 2019-nCoV with 79.5% and 96% sequence identity to SARS-CoV and a bat 64 coronavirus, SL-CoV-RaTG13, respectively 6 , was renamed SARS-CoV-2 by the which mediates membrane fusion, has 89.8% sequence identity and 96.9% sequence 83 similarity to those of SARS-CoV, and both of them utilize human 84 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as the receptor to infect human cells 6 . 85 Most importantly, the ACE2-binding affinity of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in 86 S1 subunit of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is 10-to 20-fold higher than that of 87 SARS-CoV 12 , which may contribute to the higher infectivity and transmissibility of 88 SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV. However, it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 89 can mediate membrane fusion in a manner that exceeds the capacity of SARS-CoV. 90 After binding of RBD in S1 subunit of S protein on the virion to the ACE2 91 receptor on the target cell, the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and 2 (HR2) domains in its S2 92 subunit of S protein interact with each other to form a six-helix bundle (6-HB) fusion 93 core, bringing viral and cellular membranes into close proximity for fusion and 94 infection 13 . Therefore, the 6-HB fusion core structure of SARS-CoV-2 and 95 SARS-CoV S proteins should also be compared in order to investigate the structural 96 basis for membrane fusion mediated by their S proteins and thus set the stage for the 97 rational design of coronavirus fusion inhibitors. 98 In our previous studies, we designed a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, EK1, 99 targeting the HR1 domains of HCoV S proteins, which proved to be effective in In this study, we have shown that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits much higher capacity of 108 membrane fusion than SARS-CoV, suggesting that the fusion machinery of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we found a typical syncytium phenomenon naturally formed 139 by infected cells, which is rarely reported in SARS-CoV infection (Fig. 1c) . To 140 further explore the special characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we cloned the S 141 gene into PAAV-IRES-GFP vector and established the S-mediated cell-cell fusion 142 system, using 293T cells that express SARS-CoV-2 S protein and EGFP 143 (293T/SARS-CoV-2/EGFP) as the effector cells, and ACE2/293T cells expressing 144 human ACE2 receptor as the target cells ( Fig. 1d and Fig. S1a ). After effector cells 145 and target cells were cocultured at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h, the fused cells showed at least 2-fold 146 larger size than normal cells and multiple nuclei, and these cells were observed in the 147 SARS-CoV-2 group, but not the SARS-CoV group. After coincubation for 24 h, 148 hundreds of target cells fused together as one big syncytium, containing multiple 149 nuclei (Fig. 1d) . Another 24h later, the syncytium grew bigger and could be easily Previously, we identified that the 6-HB formed by HR1 and HR2 domains of the 166 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Further, we explored the potent antiviral mechanism of EK1C4 and 309 found that the complexes of EK1C4/SARS-2HR1, EK1C4/MERS-HR1, and 310 EK1C4/SARS-2HR1 harbor higher stability and increased Tm values than those of the 311 complexes formed by EK1 and HR1s (Fig. S4) .

Their syncytium 153 was obviously formed after coincubation for 48 h, similar to the syncytium formed by 154 live SARS-CoV-2-infected Huh-7 cells (Fig. 1c and 1f). On the contrary, SARS-CoV 155 S protein lacked the ability to mediate the cell-cell fusion under the same conditions 156 (Fig. 1d) based on the required presence of exogenous trypsin to complete membrane 157 fusion in our previous studies. Therefore, compared to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 S 158 protein showed much more efficiency in mediating viral surface-fusion and entry into 159 target cells 14 . Meanwhile, no fusion was observed for 293T/EGFP cells without 160S-expression or 293T cells without ACE2-expression (Fig. 1d and Fig. S1b),161    confirming that S-receptor engagement is necessary for the S-mediated viral fusion 162 and entry.",

In the early outbreak of 420 MERS, we quickly solved the 6-HB fusion core structure formed by MERS-CoV S 421 protein HR1 and HR2 domains and designed the fusion inhibitory peptide HR2P-M2 422 which proved to be highly effective in blocking its spike protein-mediated membrane 423 fusion and inhibit in vitro MERS-CoV infection 16 . The results from animal 424 experiments showed that intranasal application of HR2P-M2 peptide could effectively 425 protect mice from MERS-CoV infection with reduction of virus titers in the lung 426 more than 1000-fold 29 . However, the MERS-CoV HR2P-M2 peptide could not inhibit 427 SARS-CoV infection, suggesting that this peptide lacks cross-inhibitory activity 428 against other \u03b2-CoVs, such as SARS-CoV and bat SARSr-CoVs. To be well prepared 429 for combating the emerging coronaviruses with epidemic or pandemic potential, we 430 designed and synthesized the first pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, EK1, and found 431 that EK1 exhibited potent inhibitory activity against all HCoVs that we tested, 432 including SARS-CoV and MARS-CoV, as well as bat SARSr-CoVs. As expected, we 433 recently have shown that EK1 is also effective in inhibiting infection of the novel 434 \u03b2-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 15 . We then optimized EK1 peptide in hopes of improving its 435 fusion inhibitory activity. Indeed, we found that one of the modified EK1 peptides, 436 EK1C4, was 226-fold and 149-fold more potent against SARS-CoV-2 S 437 protein-mediated membrane fusion and PsV infection, respectively, than EK1. EK1C4 438 also showed broad-spectrum inhibitory activity against infection by SARS-CoV, 439 MERS-CoV and other HCoVs. EK1C4 showed prolonged and significant 440 prophylactic effect against HCoV-OC43 infection in mouse model, suggesting that 441 EK1C4 may also be used as an inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. 442 Consistent with other studies 35 , HCoV-OC43 was showed as a typical neurotropic 443 virus in the mouse model, and quickly entered and established infection in mouse 444 brain tissue, leading to the relatively weak therapeutic effect of EK1C4 via intranasal 445 administration. However, SARS-CoV-2 mainly infected and caused severe 446 pathological changes in human lung tissue 4 . Therefore, EK1C4 administered no specific anti-CoV therapeutics or prophylactics have been used in 450 clinics for treatment or prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A number of 451 nonspecific antiviral drugs, including IFN, lopinavir-ritonavir (HIV protease 452 inhibitors), chloroquine, favipiravir (T-705) and remdesivir (GS-5734), have been 453 used in clinics in China to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection 30 . Their in vivo efficacies still 454 require further confirmation. Their potential use for treatment of infection by other 455 coronaviruses and emerging coronaviruses in the future is unclear. Compared with 456 these clinically used nonspecific antiviral drugs, EK1C4 has more advantages for 457 treatment and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. First, the sequence of its target, 458 the HR1 domain in S2 subunit of S protein, is highly conserved. Therefore, EK1C4 459 possesses a high genetic barrier to resistance and cannot easily induce drug-resistant 460 mutations. Second, EK1C4 can be used in an intranasal formulation to prevent 461 coronavirus infection. The small bottles can be carried easily by persons who will 462 have close contact with infected patients or high-risk populations. Third, EK1C4 can 463 be used in inhalation formulation for treatment of patients to reduce the viral loads in 464 their lungs, thus attenuating the acute lung injury caused by viral infection and 465 reducing the chance to spread the virions to the closely contacted persons. The 466 inhalation equipment can be used in home or hotel room, reducing the expense of 467 staying in hospitals. Fourth, EK1C4 is expected to be safe to humans because it will 468 be used locally, not systemically, and peptide drugs are generally safer than chemical 469 drugs. Fifth, because of its broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus activity, EK1C4 can be 470 used for treatment and prevention of infection by not only SARS-CoV-2, but also 471 other HCoVs. Sixth, recently 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been identified 31 , but 472 we found that both the HR1 and HR2 domains among those reported genomes show 473 100% identity (Fig. S9), indicating the high conservation of EK1C4 target. In the 474 meantime, the HR2 derived peptides have much larger interface on HR1 domain, 475 making it more resistant to the viral mutations. Therefore, EK1C4 shows exceptional HTB-55\u2122), A549 (CCL-185), Vero E6 (CRL-1586\u2122), RD (CCL-136\u2122), and 484 LLC-MK2 Original (CCL-7\u2122) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture 485 Collection (ATCC).
