Currently there are no drugs to treat RV infections. Nitazoxanide (NTZ) is an FDA-approved drug for parasitic infections, and has been recently shown to have broad-spectrum antiviral activities. Here we found that empiric 2-month therapy with oral NTZ was associated in the decline/elimination of RV antigen from lesions in a PID patient with RV positive granulomas, while peginterferon treatment had no effect. In addition, we characterized the effects of NTZ on cell culture models of persistent RV infection. NTZ significantly inhibited RV replication in a primary culture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and Vero and A549 epithelial cell lines in a dose dependent manner with an average 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.35 \u03bcg/ml (1.1 \u03bcM). RV strains representing currently circulating genotypes were inhibited to a similar extent. NTZ affected early and late stages of infection by inhibiting synthesis of cellular and RV RNA and interfering with intracellular trafficking of the RV surface glycoproteins, E1 and E2. These results suggest a potential application of NTZ for the treatment of persistent rubella infections, but more studies are required.",

RV is an important human pathogen because of its ability to cause multiple pathologies after establishing persistent infections in immune privileged body sites or in fetuses during the first trimester of pregnancy. Persistent infections in a fetus, which has an immature immune system, can result in multiple birth defects called congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) (Driscoll, 1969; Plotkin et al., 2011; Tondury and Smith, 1966) . Post-rubella encephalitis, often fatal, has been documented following persistent infections in the brain with both wild type and vaccine viruses (Chaari et al., 2014; Guler et al., 2009; Wolinsky et al., 1982) . Chronic recurrent rubella-associated arthritis can develop after immunization of adults (Fraser et al., 1983; Tingle et al., 1985) . Granulomas in persons with primary immune deficiencies (PID) and Fuchs's uveitis are newly suggested diseases associated with decades-long persistent RV infections (Abernathy et al., 2015; Bodemer et al., 2014; Doan et al., 2016; Perelygina et al., 2016) . Currently, there are no antiviral drugs to treat rubella infections and identification of treatments for chronic rubella diseases will be beneficial.",

NTZ was also shown to have broad-spectrum antiviral activities and is currently in Phase II/III clinical trials for hepatitis C, influenza viruses, rotavirus and norovirus (Korba et al., 2008; Rossignol, 2014; Rossignol et al., 2009) . No significant drug-related health issues have been reported; the drug is safe and is approved for pediatric use (Cohen, 2005; Fox and Saravolatz, 2005) . NTZ targets host functions that are essential for viral replication, but are not pathogen-specific. Several anti-viral mechanisms have been proposed such as induction of innate immunity, downregulation of viral receptors or interference with maturation of viral structural proteins at the post-translational stage, probably due to Ca2+ depletion inducing chronic sub-lethal stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Ashiru et al., 2014; Elazar et al., 2009; Gekonge et al., 2015; Korba et al., 2008; La Frazia et al., 2013; Rossignol et al., 2009; Trabattoni et al., 2016) .",

The patient was tired, dizzy and lost her appetite when high doses of the drug were given. She also developed thrombocytopenia. The treatment was discontinued due to adverse reactions of the drug.

While the peginterferon treatment had no effect on the amount and distribution of RV antigen, the NTZ treatment resulted in almost complete elimination of RV antigen from the lesions. No antigen was detected in the epidermis and only sporadic, weakly stained macrophages were observed in the sequential sections of the biopsy (Fig. 1C) .

At 48 hpi, the RV structural proteins were visualized in the infected cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. There were no differences between the NTZtreated and control cells in diffuse distribution of C protein in the cytoplasm (not shown). Immunostaining for E1 showed minor changes from tight perinuclear trans-Golgi localization in the control cells to more diffuse perinuclear localization in the NTZ-treated cells (Fig. 5B) . The cellular distribution of E2 changed from a co-localization with E1 in the trans-Golgi in the control cells to a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution in many NTZ-treated cells. In some NTZ-treated cells E2 formed vesicular structures evenly distributed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5B) . These data suggest that NTZ affects E1-E2 complex formation and intracellular trafficking.",

RV + signal (> 50 dots/ cell) was detected in the infected control cells, but it was lacked or substantially reduced in NTZ-treated cells (Fig. 6A-B ). In accordance with the reported results (Perelygina et al., 2015) , only a 1-3 negativestrand RNA molecules were detected in the control cultures, whereas the RV-hybridization signal in the NTZ-treated cells was less than 1 dot/cell (Fig. 6A , RV-Dz results shown), which was the same as the signal produced by the influenza probe set (not shown).

These results suggested either inhibition of cellular RNA synthesis by NTZ or activation of an RNA degradation pathway such as RNAseL. To further test this hypothesis, cell monolayers were treated with either 5 \u03bcg/ml NTZ, 0.1% DMSO or 10 \u03bcg/ml actinomycin D (inhibitor of cellular transcription) and then nascent RNA was fluorescently labeled using RNA-click chemistry.

            "text": "We observed the apparent effectiveness of NTZ and the lack of effectiveness of interferon therapy in a single PID patient with severe skin granulomas positive for RV antigen. Two-month peginterferon treatment, which was given prior to NTZ, did not eliminate or reduce the amount of RV antigen in the lesions of this patient. The inability of interferon-alpha therapies to reduce RV excretion has been also reported in infants with congenital rubella syndrome (Arvin et al., 1982) . Following treatment with 500 mg oral NTZ for two months, RV was cleared from the wounds of the patient, but no clinical improvement was observed. There are several possible reasons for that. First of all, although the association between skin granulomas and RV infection has been clearly demonstrated in individuals with some primary immune deficiencies (Bodemer et al., 2014; Perelygina et al., 2016) , the causal role of RV infection in the formation of granulomas has not yet been proven. However, the absence of RV RNA in the unaffected skin ( (Bodemer et al., 2014) ; our unpublished observations) and detection of RV in granulomas in the internal organs of some PID patients ( (Neven et al., 2017) ; our unpublished observations) suggest the causality. Of course, with lesions that develop years or even decades after vaccination, causality determinations will likely require prospective studies with long-term follow up. The patient had a very advanced/extensive case. Her lesions had have persisted for more than a decade, and so one would expect it to take a long time to reach complete clinical or histological cure after elimination of the foreign antigen, at best. Furthermore, this chronic infection may have caused long-term or, Fig. 5 . Effects of NTZ on RV proteins in HUVECs. (A) WB analysis of rubella structural proteins. HUVECs were infected with RV-Dz at an MOI of 5 or mock-infected and then exposed to 0.5 or 1 \u03bcg/ml NTZ or vehicle for 48 h. Proteins were extracted with RIPA buffer, separated by a 4-12% non-reducing NuPage gel, and then the blots were probed with rubella specific antibodies to identify RV structural proteins E1, E2 and C (two C bands indicated by the arrows). The blots were also probed with \u03b2-actin MAb to demonstrate equal protein loading. (B) Immunofluorescence analysis (at 2 dpi) of rubella structural proteins in the HUVEC monolayers that were treated with 1 \u03bcg/ml NTZ following infection with RA27/3 (MOI = 5 pfu/well). Insert represents enlarged image of the E2 globular structures. Representative results of two independent experiments are shown in both A and B. perhaps, permanent damage to the skin. In addition, secondary bacterial skin infection after the NTZ treatment may also have interfered with the healing process. However, an NTZ treatment may be effective in stopping the development in newly-formed lesions and preventing RV spread and subsequent formation of granulomas in new locations. We further confirmed NTZ anti-rubella activities in vitro and investigated molecular mechanisms of NTZ anti-rubella action using a cell culture model. We documented a dose-dependent inhibitory effect of NTZ on RV infection that is independent of viral strain. The IC 50 value was determined to be about 0.35 \u03bcg/ml (1.1 \u03bcM), which is similar to NTZ IC 50 values for other viruses such as influenza, coronavirus, or hepatitis C (ranging from 0.2 to 1.5 \u03bcg/ml), indicating good antiviral activity of the drug (Rossignol, 2014) .",

E1 and E2 must form correctly folded heterodimers in ER in order to be exported to the Golgi where RV particles assemble (Hobman et al., 1993) . NTZ was shown to deplete Ca 2+ in ER, resulting in perturbation of folding and maturation of secreted and transmembrane proteins and their transfer within ER or ER-Golgi export (Ashiru et al., 2014) . We demonstrated the lack of a colocalization of the large proportion of E2 with E1 suggesting perturbed E1-E2 complex formation. Altered localization of structural proteins would be anticipated to have negative effect on virion assembly. Despite its negative effects on multiple cellular pathways, a standard oral dose of NTZ was well tolerated by the PID patient with RV positive granuloma during two-month therapy. NTZ was shown to be safe for both children and adults in several placebo-controlled clinical trials; the rates of occurrence of adverse events did not differ significantly between NTZ and placebo treated groups (Amadi et al., 2002; Haffizulla et al., 2014; Rossignol, 2014) .",

            "text": "It is currently unclear whether the identified cellular mechanisms were responsible for the reduction of RV antigen in the patient lesions. For example, immunomodulatory effects of NTZ (Hong et al., 2012; Trabattoni et al., 2016) may have played a role. Following oral administration, NTZ is rapidly adsorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and then hydrolyzed to form tizoxanide (desacetyl nitazoxanide), which is further metabolized to form tizoxanide glucuronide (Broekhuysen et al., 2000) . Tizoxanide is at least as active in vitro as NTZ against different viruses, while tizoxanide glucuronide exhibits only moderate antiviral activities (Korba et al., 2008; La Frazia et al., 2013; Rossignol, 2009 ). Second-generation thiazolides with favorable pharmacokinetics and improved antiviral activities are currently under development and evaluation (Keeffe and Rossignol, 2009) . Future testing of active NTZ metabolites and new generation thiazolides (e.g., RM-5038 and it active derivative RM-4848) should aid in understanding of anti-RV mechanisms of thiazolides in vivo and in identification of the most effective anti-RV compounds.",
