They replicate well in experimentally infected pigs. However, on farms they often co-infect pigs with the PEDV containing an intact S protein (S-intact PEDV). We aimed to characterize viral replication and pathogenesis in neonatal gnotobiotic pigs infected simultaneously with the two types of PEDV using two recombinant PEDVs: icPC22A and its S1 NTD-del form icPC22A-S1\u0394197. Additionally, viral replication was compared in Vero and IPEC-DQ cells at the presence of bovine mucin (BM), porcine gastric mucin (PGM), swine bile and bile acids during inoculation. In the pigs coinfected with icPC22A and icPC22A-S1\u0394197, icPC22A replicated to a higher peak titer than its infection of pigs without the presence of icPC22A-S1\u0394197. The severity of diarrhea and intestinal atrophy were similar between icPC22A and the coinfection groups, but were significantly higher than icPC22A-S1\u0394197 group. In Vero and IPEC-DQ cells, certain concentrations of BM, PGM, bile and bile acids increased significantly the infectivity of icPC22A but had no or negative effects on icPC22A-S1\u0394197. These results indicated that the replication of the S-intact PEDV was enhanced during coinfection in piglets. This observation may be explained partially by the fact that mucin, bile and bile acids in gastrointestinal tract had facilitating effects on the infection of S-intact PEDV, but no/inhibition effects on S1 NTD-del PEDV.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae. It causes severe gastroenteritis in neonatal pigs worldwide. The genome size of PEDV is 28 kb. It contains ORF1a and ORF1b encoding 14-16 non-structural proteins, an ORF3 encoding an accessory protein, and four ORFs encoding structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), envelop (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. PEDV S protein mediates the essential functions of receptor binding (via S1 subunit) and subsequent fusion of the viral and cellular membranes (via S2 subunit) (Li, 2016) . S1 subunit contains two domains, the N-terminal domain (S1 NTD, residues 21-324 based on PEDV CV777) and the C-terminal domain (S1 CTD, residues 253-638). However, the cellular receptor of PEDV is still unknown (Li et al., 2017b; Shirato et al., 2016) . Although the sialic acid binding activity of S1-NTD was observed in many coronaviuses and facilitated virus replication (Schwegmann-Wessels et al., 2011; Li et al., 2016; Desmarets et al., 2014) , S1-NTD is dispensable for some mutants of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) and PEDV (Schwegmann-Wessels et al., 2011; Oka et al., 2014; Suzuki et al., 2016; Hou et al., 2017) . PEDV variants with a big deletion in the S1-NTD have been designated as S1 NTD-del PEDVs (Hou et al., 2017) . They have been detected in field pig samples, indicating sufficient replication of these S1 NTD-del PEDVs in vivo (Suzuki et al., 2015; Diep et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018a; Su et al., 2018) . Interestingly, most field S1 NTD-del PEDVs exist as a member of coinfection of pigs with the S-intact PEDV (Diep et al., 2017; Su et al., 2018) . However, the mechanisms and consequences of the coinfection have not been investigated.",

When absorption time was reduced, TGEV infectivity was also reduced in the cells whose sialic acids were removed (Schwegmann-Wessels et al., 2011) . Consequently, sialic acid binding activity may facilitate the infection of TGEV by helping the virus resist detergent-like substances encountered during passing through the gastrointestinal tract (Krempl et al., 2000) . Therefore, we hypothesized that mucin, rich in sialic acid, may enhance the infection of PEDV. Interestingly, bile acids can induce or promote the replication of some enteric viruses like a porcine sapovirus (Chang et al., 2004) and human noroviruses (Ettayebi et al., 2016) . Since intestinal epithelial cells are exposed to bile acids, we hypothesized that bile acids promote PEDV infection.",

PEDV icPC22A is an infectious cDNA clone-derived virus of the emerging highly virulent PEDV PC22A strain. On the other hand, PEDV icPC22A-S1\u0394197 is a mutant version of icPC22A bearing a 197-aa deletion (residues 34-230) in the S1 NTD region, corresponding to the S1 domain 0 (S1\u00b0) of the spike protein (Li et al., 2017a; Hou et al., 2017) . In this study, we investigated the replication and pathogenesis of the two viruses during coinfection in neonatal gnotobiotic (Gn) piglets. Some intestinal substances (mucin, bile and bile acids) were tested for their effects on the infection of the individual viruses in vitro. We selected two cell lines, Vero and IPEC-DQ cells. Vero cells are the most commonly used cell line for PEDV isolation and propagation (Teeravechyan et al., 2016) . IPEC-DQ cell is a subclone of porcine small intestinal cell line IPEC-J2 (Zhang et al., 2018b) .

We designed the primers and probes (Table 1 , Fig. S1B ) and had them synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Skokie, IL, USA). The RNA of the two viruses was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA). To generate a standard DNA, a kit of SuperScript\u2122 III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used for cDNA synthesis following manufacturer's instructions. Primer set PEDV-20320F and PEDV-21816R (Oka et al., 2014) was used to amplify a 1.5 kb or a 0.9 kb fragment covering PEDV partial nsp16 gene and S1 gene of icPC22 A and icPC22 A-S1\u0394197, respectively. The PCR products were purified using Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN) and used as standard DNA. The reaction consisted with 4 \u03bcL 5 \u00d7 PCR Buffer, 0.8 \u03bcL 10 mM dNTPs (QIAGEN), 1.2 \u03bcL each primer (10 \u03bcM), 0.4 \u03bcL each probe (5 \u03bcM), 0.2 \u03bcL RNAsin (PROMEGA, WI, USA), 0.8 \u03bcL Enzyme Mix (QIAGEN), 1.6 \u03bcL each DNA/RNA and 6.6 \u03bcL sterilized water. The RT-qPCR procedure was: 50\u00b0C for 30 min, 95\u00b0C for 15 min and 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 60 s. We generated two standard curves using Light-Cycler\u00ae 96 System (Roche Life Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The two standard curves for the serially diluted DNA fragments of icPC22A and icPC22A-S1\u0394197 showed regressions with coefficients of -0.2873 and -3.009, respectively, and the corresponding correlation coefficient (R 2 ) of 0.9987 and 0.9963, respectively. The primers and probes were further tested using individual and the mixture of two viruses. We tested the correlation between S gene titers and infectious titers of PEDV icPC22 A and icPC22 A-S1\u0394197 using serially diluted, cell cultured viruses (Table S1 and S2). For the samples of mixed viruses, the duplex RT-qPCR was performed to differentiate the S gene of each virus. The detection limit was 5 log 10 S gene copies/mL for both icPC22 A and icPC22 A-S1\u0394197.",

The replication of icPC22A was eventually enhanced during coinfection with icPC22A-S1\u0394197 in neonatal Gn piglets As shown in Fig. 1 , all PEDV-inoculated pigs but no pigs in the mock group had diarrhea and shed PEDV. The fecal consistency scores and peak fecal PEDV N and S RNA shedding titers of piglets in the coinfection group reached the peak at 1.5 dpi, which was delayed half a day compared with the icPC22A group (1 dpi) but earlier than the icPC22A-S1\u0394197 group (> 4 dpi). By 4 dpi, all pigs in the icPC22A and coinfection groups but no pigs in the icPC22A-S1\u0394197 group died or showed moribund. Compared with the peak fecal PEDV N gene shedding titer (11.6 \u00b1 0.2 log 10 copies/mL) of piglets in the icPC22A group (1 dpi), pigs in the coinfection group had a significantly higher peak titer (13.6 \u00b1 0.7 log 10 copies/mL) ( Fig. 1B and Table 2 ) at a delayed time point (1.5 dpi). In addition, the peak fecal infectious PEDV shedding titer of the coinfection group (5.8 \u00b1 0.4 log 10 TCID 50 /mL) were significantly higher than that of the single infection groups (4.9 \u00b1 0.1 and 1.8 \u00b1 1.8 log 10 TCID 50 /mL of icPC22 A and icPC22 A-S1\u0394197 groups, respectively) ( Table 2) . Interestingly, the peak S gene shedding titers of icPC22 A (11.4 \u00b1 0.5 log 10 copies/mL) in the coinfection group at 1.5 dpi was significantly higher than that of icPC22 A group (10.5 \u00b1 0.5 log 10 copies/mL) at 1 dpi (Fig. 1C, Table 2 ). However, the peak S gene shedding titers (5.8 \u00b1 1.2 log 10 copies/mL) of icPC22 A-S1\u0394197 in the coinfection group was significantly lower than that of the icPC22 A-S1\u0394197 group (7.6 \u00b1 1.7 log 10 copies/mL) (Fig. 1C , Table 2 ). In the second passage of coinfection, only icPC22 A but not icPC22 A-S1\u0394197 S gene was detected in the large intestinal contents (LIC) of the piglet, which was orally inoculated with the SIC (sample #PE1158) of one pig in the coinfection group and was positive for both viruses. The LIC had a virus titer of 8.8 log 10 TCID 50 /mL for infectious PEDV, 12.3 log 10 S gene copies/mL and 14.6 log 10 N gene copies/mL for icPC22A.",

            "text": "We developed a duplex RT-qPCR targeting the S gene of PEDV to differentiate the two viruses. We found that the duplex RT-qPCR assay had different sensitivities for the detection of infectious icPC22 A and icPC22 A-S1\u0394197 (Table S1) although it had a similar detection limit (5 log 10 copies/mL) for both viruses. For example, 9 log 10 S gene copies/ mL corresponded to 6.2 and 4.2 log 10 FFU/mL for icPC22A and icPC22A-S1\u0394197, respectively. It may reflect the fact that icPC22A-S1\u0394197 replicates to lower peak infectious titers (\u223c5.0 log 10 FFU/mL) than that (\u223c7.0 log 10 FFU/mL) of icPC22A in Vero cells although both viruses replicated to similar peak titers based on the S gene (\u223c10.0 log 10 copies/mL) (Fig. 3A) . In the mixture of two viruses, the detection Fig. 6 . Effect of bile and bile acids on the infection of PEDV icPC22A and icPC22A-S1\u0394197 in Vero (A-E) and IPEC-DQ cells (F-J). Monolayers of Vero or IPEC-DQ cells in 96-well plates were inoculated with a MOI of 0.02 icPC22 A or icPC22 A-S1\u0394197 in medium containing 10 \u03bcg/mL trypsin and different concentrations of bile or bile acids. After incubation at 37\u2103 for 2 h, the inoculum was removed followed by three washings. DMEM/RPMI-1640 containing 50 \u03bcg/mL SBTI and swine PEDV positive serum (virus neutralization titer 1:1024, 1:500 dilution) was added. At 8 hpi, cells were fixed with acetone-methanol (1:4) and infectivity was tested by IF assay. Each Experiment was performed three times. Data are shown as M \u00b1 SD, and number of asterisks indicate significant difference between groups (*, p < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001). sensitivity of each virus differed significantly (Tables S2). For the detection of icPC22 A at high titers (6.2 log 10 FFU/mL) and as the predominant virus in the mixture of two viruses (icPC22A: icPC22 A-S1\u0394197 = 10 2 -10 5 :1), the S gene titers (\u223c8.8-9.1 log 10 S gene copies/ mL) (Table S2 ) were similar to that (\u223c9.0 log 10 S gene copies/mL) in the single virus alone (Table S1 ). Because icPC22 A replicated to high titers and was the predominant virus during the coinfection in pigs, we can predict that the peak infectious titer of icPC22A in coinfection was \u223c1.0 log 10 -higher than that in its single infection based on the duplex RT-qPCR results (\u223c11.4 vs \u223c10.5 log 10 S gene copies/mL) (Table 2) . So, we conclude that the replication of icPC22A was interfered at the beginning based on delayed timing (1.5 vs 1.0 dpi) to reach peak titers but enhanced eventually in coinfection compared with its single infection in pigs. On the other hand, the sensitivity for the detection of icPC22A-S1\u0394197 decreased significantly and icPC22A-S1\u0394197 became undetectable when icPC22A was high (6.2 log 10 FFU/mL) and icPC22 A-S1\u0394197 infectious titers were lower than 3.2 log 10 FFU/mL in the mixture of two viruses (Table S2 ). Therefore, the decreased peak S gene titer (\u223c5.8 log 10 copies/mL) of icPC22A-S1\u0394197 in coinfection of pigs compared with that (\u223c7.6 log 10 copies/mL) in its single infection may be due to inhibition of replication or the decreased detection sensitivity of the duplex RT-qPCR for the detection of icPC22A-S1\u0394197 during coinfection (Table 2 ).",

In addition, plaque assays were performed to isolate and purify individual viruses from the SIC of one of the coinfection pigs. However, only S-intact PEDV was isolated alone. In contrast, S1 NTD-del PEDV was exclusively detected together with the Sintact PEDV from the plagues. In the second passage of the coinfection in pigs, S-intact PEDV but not S1 NTD-del PEDV RNA was detected in the LIC of the pig inoculated with the SIC of the pig inoculated with both viruses. This finding suggests that S1 NTD-del PEDV had no replication advantage and was either outcompeted or coexisted with Sintact PEDV in pigs. This conclusion is in agreement with what were observed in the field (Diep et al., 2017; Su et al., 2018) . S1 NTD-del PEDV replicated to a lower peak titer in coinfection than that in single virus infection in both Vero cells and IPEC-DQ cells. These in vitro results were similar to those in the pig studies. In the second passage of coinfection, S1 NTD-del PEDV RNA was detected in Vero cells but not in IPEC-DQ cells, probably due to the lower replication efficiency of the S1 NTD-del PEDV in IPEC-DQ cells than in Vero cells ( Fig. 3A and C) .",

            "text": "Similar to other sialic acid-binding coronaviruses, the S1 NTD of PEDV has a sialic acid binding activity, and the sugar-binding activities of a field isolate PEDV variant CHGD-01 was stronger than that of the prototype strain PEDV CV777 using BM (Deng et al., 2016) . The sialic acid binding activity occurred within the N-terminal 249 residues and the capacity of sialic acid binding differs among PEDV strains using an hemagglutination assay . The recombinant virus used in this study, PEDV icPC22 A-S1\u0394197, is a S1 NTD-del version of icPC22A. It lost most sialic acid binding activity tested in Vero cells (Hou et al., 2017) . In this study, we comparatively tested icPC22 A-S1\u0394197 and icPC22 A in Vero and IPEC-DQ cells treated with NA. Similar to the previous reports, our results confirmed that the binding of S1 NTD of PEDV to sialic acids on cell surface enhanced virus infectivity. BM is a mixture of highly glycosylated proteins containing sugar moieties, such as 5-N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2), 5-N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), and 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). Among them, Neu5Gc and Neu5Ac can serve as receptors or co-receptors for some alphacoronaviruses (e.g., TGEV) and gammacoronaviruses [e.g., infectious bronchitis virus (IBV)] (Cavanagh and Davis, 1986; Krempl et al., 1997) . Similar to TGEV, which uses Neu5Gc and Neu5 Ac as co-receptors (Krempl et al., 1997; Schultze et al., 1996; Schwegmann-Wessels and Herrler, 2006) , the S1 NTD of PEDV interacted with sugar (Deng et al., 2016) . PGM contains 0.5-1.5% N-Acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc). Our data indicated that low-medium concentrations of BM or PGM enhanced the infectivity of S-intact PEDV in both Vero and IPEC-DQ cells. In contrast, the S1 NTD-del PEDV was not affected or inhibited, probably due to the covered mucin that blocked virus binding to the receptors. The intestinal epithelial cells are covered by a layer of mucus that is rich in sialic acids. These results suggest that low-medium amount of mucin binding to S-intact PEDV may help the virus particles approach the receptors via sticking to the sialic acids on the cell surface. However, the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the S protein of S1 NTD-del PEDV, which lacks most sialic acid binding activity, is probably covered with mucin and blocked its binding to the receptors. When high concentration of mucin saturates the S1 NTD of S-intact PEDV, it can also cover viral RBD and block its binding to the receptors, resulting in decreased infectivity as observed in 1.0 mg/mL BM effects on S-intact PEDV in Vero cells (Fig. 5A) .",

The bile acids are stored in the gall bladder (at \u223c300 mM) and released into the small intestine (McLeod and Wiggins, 1968) . In the small intestine, the total bile acids have a concentration of 2-30 mM (Dowling, 1973) . We selected two primary bile acids (GCDCA and CDCA) and two secondary bile acids (DCA and UDCA) to test the effects of bile acids on PEDV infection. The secondary bile acids are dehydroxylated ones from the primary bile acids by intestinal bacteria (Bj\u00f6rkhem, 1985) . Our data indicated that a broad range of concentrations of bile and bile acids enhanced the infectivity of S-intact PEDV in both Vero and IPEC-DQ cells. However, bile and bile acids cannot increase the infectivity of S1 NTD-del PEDV. These results suggest that the bile-and bile acid-mediated promotion of PEDV infection is related to the S1 NTD. It was reported that GCDCA may facilitate the adaptation of a S-intact PEDV to trypsin-free growth in Vero cells at the early passages (< P10) (Kim et al., 2017) . However, the mechanisms of the bile acid function on the PEDV infection is unknown and consequently need to be further investigated.",

Consequently, the disease caused by the coinfection was as severe as that by the highly virulent S-intact PEDV alone. This situation is quite different from what occurred for PRCV and TGEV: the wild spread of clinically mild PRCV, which often infects pigs asymptomatically and repeatedly, inducing protective herd immunity against TGEV outbreaks (VanCott et al., 1994; Brim et al., 1995) . PRCV functions as a natural effective vaccine against TGEV. However, for PEDV, the clinically mild S1 NTD-del PEDV variants do not infect pigs alone. Therefore, safe and effective vaccines are still desired to control the deadly PEDV infection in neonatal piglets. Due to the 100% mortality rates of piglets in the icPC22 A-infected pigs (Hou et al., 2017) and coinfection groups, we currently cannot determine whether the pathogenicity of PEDV icPC22 A is enhanced during the coinfection. That should be investigated in older pigs (weaned pigs, sows and boars) which are more resistant to PEDV infection and diseases (Niederwerder and Hesse, 2018) . In addition, the emergence of S1 NTD-del PEDV variants may complicate PEDV disease pattern on farms, which needs to be further investigated.",
