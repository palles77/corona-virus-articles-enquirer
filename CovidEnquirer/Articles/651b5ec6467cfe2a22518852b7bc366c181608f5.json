Previously, we reported that skimmed and concentrated bovine late colostrum (SCBLC) obtained from normal unimmunized cows at 6 to 7 d after parturition effectively prevented against human rotavirus (HRV)-induced severe gastroenteritis in vivo, when administered as a single dose 60 min before viral inoculation. In the present study, we examined the efficacy of multiple administrations of SCBLC at smaller dosages after viral inoculation in vivo. We demonstrate that multiple administrations within 24 h after virus inoculation resulted in earlier recovery from diarrheal symptoms, in an administration frequencydependent manner. Furthermore, we investigated whether isolated IgG anti-HRV activity in SCBLC was equivalent to that of IgG isolated from bovine mature milk as measured by in vitro activity assays. We found that IgG-containing fractions from SCBLC and mature milk exhibited approximately the same level of anti-HRV activity. We concluded that the SCBLC contains a high level of IgG against HRV-induced severe gastroenteritis, which will be possible to use in protective effects in immunocompromised hosts, such as children and the elderly. Multiple doses of SCBLC during the early stages of infection or lower dosage of SCBLC given as a single dose both resulted in relief of diarrheal symptoms.",

It causes more than 527,000 deaths annually, most of which occur in developing countries (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2008) . To reduce the significant mortality caused by this pathogen, 2 rotavirus vaccines, RotaTeq (Merck and Co., Whitehouse station, NJ) and Rotarix (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium), have been licensed and incorporated into universal immunization programs in many countries (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2008) . However, first doses of both vaccines are strictly limited to infants aged between 6 and 15 wk, because of an increased risk of intussusception (Nakagomi and Nakagomi, 2009 ). Therefore, the development of an alternative prophylactic approach, especially non-time-limited first dose, is required for immunocompromised hosts.",

Hyperimmunized colostrum-containing rotavirus-specific, neutralizing IgG was produced by immunizing pregnant Holstein cows with HRV and harvesting colostrum after delivery. However, it is difficult to generate large-scale amounts of hyperimmunized colostrum. Furthermore, the sale of early colostrum from cows within 5 d of parturition as a food substance is illegal in Japan. Recently, we have reported that skimmed, concentrated, and pasteurized bovine milk from healthy lactating cows at 6 to 7 d postparturition, referred to as skimmed and concentrated bovine late colostrum (SCBLC) , was effective at preventing HRV-induced diarrhea in suckling mice, indicating the potential of SCBLC to be used as a prophylactic food additive against HRV infections (Inagaki et al., 2010) .",

Oral administration of SCBLC protects against influenza viral infection by activation of cellular immunity in vivo using a mouse model and in vitro using Murine Peyer's patch cells (Uchida et al., 2012) .

Previously, multiple oral administrations per day of chemically synthesized sulfated sialyl lipid were shown to be capable of reducing the dosage per administration necessary to achieve protection against human rotavirus infection in mice (Takahashi et al., 2002) . In general, a lower dosage per administration would be more acceptable for immunocompromised hosts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that anti-HRV activity of IgG is correlated with lactation stage. We previously hypothesized that the protective effect of SCBLC against HRV gastroenteritis was due to the presence of IgG as neutralizing antibody. Here, we demonstrate that SCBLC contains a larger amount of IgG than mature milk, which can bind to HRV and neutralize it.",

In the case of bovine rotavirus (NCDV strain), similar band patterns were detected ( Figure 6 ). Because these are all proteins located in the outer capsid of the virus, we concluded that bovine IgG protects against rotavirus infection by neutralizing the virus.",

Although immunoglobulin levels in cow milk are predicted to decline throughout the duration of lactation, the anti-HRV activity of IgG appeared to hold regardless of the length of lactation ( Figure 5 ). Furthermore, bovine colostrum IgG binding to rotavirus was detected using RIPA ( Figure 6 ). Although the efficacy of hyperimmunized bovine colostrum against HRV was demonstrated in clinical trials of children (Ebina et al., 1992; Sarker et al., 1998) , its actual use has been limited because of difficulties in large-scale production. Thus, unimmunized SCBLC produced from normal healthy cows may provide an alternative option for the prevention and management of severe rotavirus diarrhea in immunocompromised children.",

Comparison of the anti-human rotavirus (HRV) effects of IgG fractions from skimmed and concentrated bovine late colostrum (SCBLC) and mature milk. The HRV MO strain was incubated with each of the samples for 60 min before inoculation. The virus-sample mixture was then added to African rhesus monkey MA104 cells (kidney cell line) and the mixture was then incubated under a 5% CO 2 atmosphere at 37\u00b0C for a further 22 h. Control cells were prepared in the same way, except that preincubation occurred in the presence of Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Concentrations of the samples are given on a logarithmic scale: SCBLC (open squares), IgG from SCBLC (SCBLC IgG, closed squares), mature milk (open triangles), and IgG from mature milk (mature milk IgG, closed triangles). The inhibitory activity of each sample is expressed as the percentage of infected cells compared with control cells (100%). The experiments were carried out in triplicate at least 3 times, and representative results for each sample are given as means \u00b1 SD. Figure 6 . Analysis of rotavirus structural proteins recognized by bovine colostrum IgG. Immunoglobulin G from normal bovine colostrum was incubated with 35 S-labeled rotavirus. The virus-IgG mixture was purified using protein G-Sepharose, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 5 to 15% gradient gel. Imaging was performed on a Bio-imaging analyzer (FUJIX BAS-2000; Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan 813 rhea (Figure 1) . Second, we examined the effect of altering the administration frequency of SCBLC against HRV-induced diarrhea. Five administrations of SCBLC after viral inoculation (6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hpi) at a dosage of 0.1 mg was as effective as a greater dosage administered fewer times (i.e., prophylactic single administration) and did have the potential of reducing development of diarrhea (Figure 2 ). These results also indicated that recovery of diarrheal symptoms was relevant to the frequency of administrations after virus inoculation, especially within 24 hpi ( Figure 4A and 4C). Additionally, we concluded the minimum effective dosage over multiple administrations within 24 hpi was 0.3 mg (Figure 3) .",

From 2000 onward, rotavirus infection contributed significantly to alterations in the distribution of tight junction proteins [occludin (Obert et al., 2000; Dickman et al., 2000; Beau et al.,2007) , claudin-1 (Dickman et al., 2000) , and ZO-1 (Dickman et al., 2000) ] in Caco-2 cells.

Another remarkable observation was multiple administrations from 24 hpi onward resulted in earlier recovery from HRV-induced diarrhea ( Figure  4B and 4C).
