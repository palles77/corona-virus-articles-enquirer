Negative results were obtained in all control tests (those without addition of mucosa), in 1 of the 8 patients with diarrhoea, and 5 of the 7 patients without diarrhoea. Of the 7 positive fluorescence results. 2 were obtained against mucosal bacteria only, 2 against bacteria from the juice, and in 3 there was positive fluorescence with bacteria from both juice and mucosa (table III). In the group without diarrhoea the only positive fluorescence was seen on mucosal bacteria. DISCUSSION Like earlier observers, we found bacteria on culture of small-intestinal mucosal homogenates. These organisms resembled the luminal flora. Our mucosal flora consisted of predominantly coccal forms but there were also some rod-shaped forms-a finding which accords with the findings of Nelson and Mata. 10 We cultured organisms from all mucosal homogenates, whereas Nelson and Mata took cultures from only 4 of 7 patients studied.",

The importance of the mucosal antibody in the pathogenesis of diarrhoea is unclear. We have no evidence of any structural damage caused by antigen/antibody reaction; indeed the mucosa was normal or near normal in all patients. Possibly, in persistent diarrhoea! states adherent and also non-adherent bacteria which are regarded as being non-pathogenic acquire toxins which are absorbed by the mucosa, and this leads to antibody production either locally by the mucosal plasma-cells or through the systemic immune system. It is also possible that there is, or had been, an increase in mucosal permeability to bacterial antigen which had allowed sensitisation to occur-a similar mechanism as has been postulated for food antigens as a complication of gastroenteritis. Further work is necessary to characterise the positively fluorescing bacteria and their adhering properties, as well as the nature of the antigens. Classification of the antibody will also be necessary and may give insight into pathogenesis.",

In this group the plasma-theophylline half-life (mean=419&middot;8 min) was significantly longer during the acute stage of their illness than 1 month later (mean 249&middot;9 min). There was no appreciable change in half-life in 4 patients who were febrile but in whom seroconversion did not occur. These preliminary results suggest that certain upper-respiratory-tract viral infections may affect theophylline metabolism. INTRODUCTION THE effect of acute viral infections, with the exception of acute hepatitis, on the distribution of drugs is largely unknown. Plasma-theophylline is often raised during acute upper-respiratory-tract viral illness in our asthmatic patients receiving round-the-clock theophylline therapy. We have investigated the effect of viral infection on the metabolism of theophylline in such patients.",

All patients received round-the-clock aminophylline (theophylline ethylenediamine) before the study, but this therapy was suspended at least 6 h before the half-life was determined. The half-life was measured after a 10-min intravenous dose of aminophylline equivalent to the patient's regular oral dose which had been adjusted to maintain plasma-theophylline between 10 and 20 g/ml. Plasma samples were collected after 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 hours. Theophylline concentrations were measured by a modification of the Schack and Waxler procedure.' Inter-assay variation between duplicate control theophylline measurements in our laboratory does not exceed 3 -7%.2 The equation for the regression line of the log of plasma-theophylline concentration against time was obtained by the least-squares method. The half-life was determined by dividing the log of 2 by the slope of the last half of regression line. Statistical analysis was performed by means of a 1-tailed Student's t test. Two subjects (3 and 4) had positive throat culture for group-A p-hsemolytic streptococcus and received therapy for 10 days with oral penicillin. 3 of the 4 subjects in whom seroconversion, as judged by a respiratory-virus panel, was lacking had gastrointestinal symptoms and signs, rather than indications of respiratory illness.",

Four additional subjects having febrile illness without seroconversion had no change in half-life; their mean halflife was 317 (&plusmn;66) during the illness and 332 (&plusmn;64) min 1 month afterwards (P>0-1). Subject 1 experienced acute theophylline toxicity during the febrile illness (plasma-theophylline 43.3 3 g/ml). DISCUSSION Our data suggest that patients with influenza A and adenovirus infection may have longer theophylline plasma half-lives during acute infection than 1 month afterwards. This could be the result of viral infectioninduced acute-phase prolongation or convalescent-phase shortening of half-life. We have insufficient data to determine the exact mechanism. Future confirmation of our data, by means of steady-state clearance determinations, may help us to understand this phenomenon. Since subjects' liver transaminases remained normal, and there was no evidence of dehydration or important alteration of renal function, it is quite possible that influenza and adenovirus infection specifically affected the enzymatic mechanism for theophylline metabolism.",
