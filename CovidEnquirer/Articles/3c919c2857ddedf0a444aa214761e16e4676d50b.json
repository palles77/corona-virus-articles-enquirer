This method uses a small amount of peripheral blood mononuclear cells that are infected in vitroclusters of cells can be demonstrated. The presence of CD23 with EBV in the presence of FK506, a T cell immunosuppressant. Traditionally, outgrowth of proliferating B cells is monitored by visualization of microscopic clusters of cells about a week after infection with EBV. Clumps of LCL can be seen by the naked eye after several weeks. We describe an assay to determine early if EBVmediated growth transformation is successful even before microscopic clusters of cells can be demonstrated. The presence of CD23 hi CD58 + cells observed as early as three days post-infection indicates a successful outcome.",

Subsequently, expand culture by increasing its volume 2-3 fold using complete RPMI. 4. Periodicity of feeding cells should be determined based on rate of cell growth. When the culture medium turns yellow, it is generally time to replace the media as above. Typically, this occurs once per week. However, some cell lines may need to be fed more or less frequently. Expand culture to 75-100 ml over the next few weeks. 5. Cryopreservation: When freezing down cells, centrifuge cells at 600 x g for 10 minutes at room temperature.

Through the use of FK506, a T cell immunosuppressant, and high titers of infectious virus we are able to promote proliferation of EBV-infected B cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These interventions make the described method more efficient, resulting in rapid expansion of cells for subsequent experiments.Traditionally, growth transformation has been monitored by visualization of clusters of cells by light microscopy about a week after exposure to EBV 6, 15 . However, clustering of cells is not a specific indicator of EBV-mediated growth transformation. We have previously demonstrated consistent identification of the proliferating cell population via flow cytometry 14 , providing an accurate and specific method to determine successful outcome as early as three days after exposure of B cells to EBV.",
