The exact reason to have a negative influenza test at the time of positive MERS-CoV is not completely understood. It is possible that the presence of MERS-CoV inhibits the PCR reaction for influenza virus. However, an earlier case of MERS-CoV tested initially positive for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. 4 On the other hand, the positivity of nasal swabs for influenza is specimen type and technique dependent. 5 Thus, initially negative influenza tests could be a false test result. Positive results for viral respiratory pathogens should not preclude testing for MERS-CoV because coinfection can occur. 6 Only a small number of MERS cases had co-infection with influenza A, parainfluenza, herpes simplex, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. 7 In one case, a co-infection with Herpes simplex virus type 1 DNA13 and rhinovirus RNA14 were detected by RT-PCR. 8 The investigation of the first 47 cases showed no co-infection with MERS-CoV. 2 There is a controversy regarding the risk of increased or decreased severity of co-infections. For example co-infections with Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and human meta-pneumovirus (hMPV) causes more severe infection than either virus alone with longer hospitalization and oxygen requirement. 9 Other studies did not demonstrate these effects. 10 The association and the impact of co-infection with MERS-CoV and influenza viruses deserve further evaluation and studies.",
