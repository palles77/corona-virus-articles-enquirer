Next, we studied the role of the expressed nucleocapsid protein in induction of a protective immune response to IBV in chickens. Chickens were primed with nucleocapsidprotein and subsequently boosted with inactivated IBV, strain M41. Proltferative responses of blood mononuclear cells corresponded with increased mean haemagglutination inhibition and virus neutralization titres.

            "text": "The virus consists of a lipid-containing membrane, a single-stranded RNA genome and three structural proteins. Apart from the internally localized nucleocapsid protein (N), the virus consists of two glycoproteins anchored in the lipid membrane',2. The integral matrix protein (M ) protrudes only slightly from the membrane in contrast to the spike protein (S) exposed at the surface which gives the virus its coronaviral image. The virus can cause an acute respiratory disease in young chickens and a reduction in egg production in laying hens. Attention has been focused primarily on responses to the S protein. This was based on the observation that neutralizing antibody showed specificity for the S protein3. By generating antigenic variants of the S protein the virus is capable of avoiding elimination by virus neutralizing antibody4. These distinct antigenic variations pose a problem in IBV vaccine design5. To circumvent the problem of the observed antigenic variability of the S protein we directed our attention to the IBV N protein which is more conserved among IBV strains'v6. Observations in other Protection is not only induced by generating cytotoxic T cells (36) , but also by generating T helper cell responses that augment the activity of B cells in production of virus-neutralizing antibody . ' l-l 3 Recently, we have shown that two murine CD4-positive T cell hybridomas generated from an IBV-specific T cell line were responsive to N proteins of several IBV strains14. Now the immunogenicity of recombinant-DNA encoded N protein in relation to the cellular immune response to IBV was studied. First it was shown that delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and lymphocyte proliferative responses to IBV were induced upon immunization of mice with the expressed N protein. The purpose of the work described in this paper was secondly, to assess the role of the N protein in induction of cellular immune responses to IBV in the chicken, thirdly to test whether the N protein can accelerate the induction of virus-neutralizing (VN) and haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibodies, and finally to ascertain whether priming of chickens with the N protein results in increased tracheal protection against challenge with IBV.",

However, using a more sensitive immunofluorescence assay, virus was detected in one out of eight chickens primed with IBV. In the N protein primed group of chickens eight out of ten showed protection on the basis of ciliary activity. Virus was detected by immunofluorescence in only three out of ten chickens, suggesting that 70% of N-primed chickens showed protection in this group. In the control group several animals showed ciliostasis after challenge and in eight out of 12 chickens virus was detected in tracheal tissue. This indicated that, at the most, 33% demonstrated signs of resistance to live IBV in this group, which equals the expected percentage of protection due to one vaccination with inactivated IBV 29. To test the hypothesis that priming of chickens with IBV or IBV N protein contributes to protection we analysed the data obtained by immunofluorescence microscopy using a linear model (33) ND, not done of logistic regression. We compared the induction of protection following priming with IBV or IBV N protein to priming with the control CGZ protein.

Thus the data indicated a role for the N protein in activation of T-cells in the response to intact IBV. Subsequently, the role of the N protein in induction of protective immunity to IBV in chickens was explored. Three main findings emerged from this study. First, a priming effect of the N protein on proliferative responses of blood mononuclear cells was seen 2 weeks after secondary immunization. Primary N protein vaccination did not result in a detectable proliferative response to IBV. Primary immunization with inactivated virus showed responses to IBV in 25% of chickens, similar to previous reports 31. After secondary immunization of chickens with IBV, the priming effect of the N protein became manifest and exceeded the outcome of priming with virus twofold. In 50% of chickens a proliferative response to IBV was shown. No responses were observed in chickens vaccinated with CGZ which demonstrates the specificity of the IBV sensitization by N protein priming.",

In individual chickens, however, proliferative responses did not always coincide with increased HI and VN titres, an observation made earlier by Timms and Bracewel131. This finding can be explained by the notion that not all proliferative antigen-specific cells are T-helper cells 34.",

Single vaccination with inactivated IBV results in little or no protection in the trachea against challenge infection, whereas two vaccinations may result in up to 80 100% protection 29,3\u00b0. We hypothesized that a priming effect of immunization with the N protein should be visible within these ranges. Indeed, the data obtained by immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that 70% of N-primed and IBV-boosted chickens had resisted tracheal challenge. Of the chickens primed with CGZ, 33% had resisted challenge. The ciliostasis assay indicated a higher percentage of protected chickens compared to the data obtained by immunofluorescence microscopy. This discrepancy is explained by the observation that in older chickens tracheal symptoms due to virus replication are less severe than in young chickens 3\u00b0.",

Our findings add to the pivotal role of internal viral antigens in the induction of protective immunity by activation of cytotoxic or helper T-cell responses 1\u00b0'12,13. These internal antigens, usually less subject to antigenic variation than surface proteins, have been shown to generate crossreactive protective immunity 8'9'38.
