Viral nucleic acid is extracted from the sample material and amplified in three successive steps. The double-stranded DNA is first heat-denaturated and separated into single strands. The specific target fragment of DNA strand is then amplified (Figure 3 ) by pairs of target-specific oligonucleotide primers, each of which anneal to one strand of unfold double-stranded DNA. Each annealed primer acts as an origin for heat-stable polymerase enzyme and a complementary strand is synthesized via sequential addition of deoxyribonucleotides.

The size of the amplified product is compared to control amplicons and other standards in the same gel. Various hybridization assays, based on labeled complementary oligonucleotides (probes), are also used to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the detection. For applications with a large number of targets, such as respiratory virus detection or papillomavirus typing, conventional PCR with post-PCR hybridization is still a popular solution. Products of highly multiplexed PCR assays can be identified by probe hybridization on microarrays using scanning fluorometer or on fluorescent microbeads using flow-cytometric bead counting.",

Fluorescence is generated by a dsDNA dye or a fluorescent probe system included into the reaction mix. The earlier the amplification product becomes detectable over the background, the higher is the amount of virus in the sample ( Figure 5) . A dsDNA dye (e.g. SYBR Green I) reacts with any dsDNA formed during amplification, but amplicon specificity can be confirmed by melting curve analysis. It also allows testing for more than one virus from the same sample ( Figure 6 ). There are many alternative probe chemistries for real-time PCR, the most common including dual label probes. Since probes are usually more selective for their target sequences than primers, probe based real-time PCR methods offer highest specificities with fastest reaction times. Multichannel instruments allow the use of probes with different exitation and emission spectra for the simultaneous detection of several different analytes in a single tube. The PCR assays are extremely sensitive and can therefore be influenced by inhibitors of the polymerase enzyme that are sometimes present in clinical samples. Internal controls can be included into reaction mixtures.
