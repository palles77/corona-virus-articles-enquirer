The host factors required for alphavirus entry remain poorly characterized 2 . Using a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-based screen, we identified the cell adhesion molecule Mxra8 as an entry mediator for multiple emerging arthritogenic alphaviruses including chikungunya (CHIKV), Ross River, Mayaro, and O'nyong nyong (ONNV) viruses. Gene editing of mouse Mxra8 or human MXRA8 resulted in reduced viral infection of cells, and reciprocally, ectopic expression resulted in increased infection. Mxra8 bound directly to CHIKV particles and enhanced virus attachment and Users may view, print, copy, and download text and data-mine the content in such documents, for the purposes of academic research, subject always to the full Conditions of use: http://www.nature.",

Consistent with these findings, Mxra8-Fc protein or anti-Mxra8 monoclonal antibodies blocked CHIKV infection in multiple cell types including primary human synovial fibroblasts, osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and skeletal muscle cells. Mutagenesis experiments suggest that Mxra8 binds to a surface-exposed region across the A and B domains of CHIKV E2, a speculated site of attachment. Finally, administration of Mxr8a-Fc protein or anti-Mxra8 blocking antibodies reduced CHIKV or ONNV infection and associated foot swelling in mice. Pharmacological targeting of Mxra8 could form a strategy for mitigating infection and disease by multiple arthritogenic alphaviruses.",

We inoculated lentivirus-transduced 3T3 mouse fibroblasts with CHIKV-181/25-mKate2, such that virtually all cells expressed the reporter gene by 24 h. The few cells lacking mKate2 expression were sorted, propagated in the presence of neutralizing anti-CHIKV mAbs 5 , and then re-inoculated with CHIKV-181/25-mKate2. After two rounds of infection and sorting, genomic DNA from mKate2-negative cells was harvested, sgRNAs were sequenced, and analyzed using MAGeCK 6 (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 ). The top candidate was Mxra8 (also called DICAM, ASP3, or limitrin), an adhesion molecule found in mammals, birds, and amphibians (Extended Data Fig 1b-c) , that is expressed on epithelial, myeloid, and mesenchymal cells [7] [8] [9] [10] and shares homology with junctional adhesion molecule 9 , a reovirus entry receptor 11 . We validated Mxra8 using three different sgRNAs in bulk 3T3 cells, by generating \u0394Mxra8 single-cell clones in 3T3 and MEF cells, and confirming gene deletion and cell viability (Extended Data Fig 2a-e) . Infection of CHIKV-181/25 was reduced in \u0394Mxra8 cells, and trans-complementation of Mxra8 in \u0394Mxra8 3T3 cells restored infectivity (Fig 1a-b) . As CHIKV-181/25 is a cell culture-adapted vaccine strain 12 that has acquired heparan sulfate (HS) binding activity 13 , we evaluated Mxra8 with other CHIKV strains. Infection of CHIKV-AF15561, the parental Asian strain of CHIKV-181/25, which binds poorly to HS 14 , and CHIKV-37997, a West African strain, was abolished in \u0394Mxra8 3T3 cells, reduced in \u0394Mxra8 MEFs (Fig 1a) , and restored in trans-complemented \u0394Mxra8 3T3 cells (Fig 1b-c) . However, the dependence on Mxra8 was less with CHIKV-LR 2006, an East Central South African strain (Fig 1a and d) . To confirm that CHIKV required Mxra8 independently of HS binding, we expressed murine Mxra8 in parental or glycosaminoglycan-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells 15 (Extended Data Fig 3a) . Expression of Mxra8 enhanced infectivity of CHIKV regardless of whether CHO cells expressed HS or other glycosaminoglycans (Extended Data Fig 3b-c) .",

Whereas Mayaro, Ross River, ONNV, and Barmah Forest arthritogenic alphaviruses showed reduced infection in \u0394Mxra8 3T3 cells, Semliki Forest and Getah viruses had partial phenotypes, and other related alphaviruses (Sindbis [SINV], Bebaru, Una, and Middleburg) showed little dependence on Mxra8 (Fig 1e and Extended Data Fig 4) . Minimal differences in infection were observed between control and \u0394Mxra8 3T3 cells with chimeric SINV expressing the structural genes of the encephalitic Eastern (EEEV) or Western (WEEV) equine encephalitis alphaviruses or a Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV-GFP) (Fig 1e) . No effect of Mxra8 was seen on infection of unrelated positive-or negative-sense RNA viruses (Fig 1f) . We next assessed whether any of the four isoforms of the human MXRA8 ortholog (Extended Data Fig 1b) served a similar function. As HeLa cells did not express MXRA8 (Extended Data Fig 5) , we used these cells for ectopic expression (Extended Data Fig 6a) . MXRA8-1, -2, and -4 but not MXRA8-3 were detected on the cell surface, and MXRA8-1 and -2 enhanced CHIKV infectivity (Fig 1g) . Similarly, expression of MXRA8-2 in A549 or 293T cells resulted in greater CHIKV infection (Extended Data Fig 6b-c) . Consistent with this observation, expression of different sgRNAs targeting all isoforms of MXRA8 in MRC-5 human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5), foreskin fibroblasts (HFF-1), retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE), and fibrosarcoma cells (Hs 633T) resulted in less CHIKV infection than in control gene-edited cells (Fig 1h and Extended Data Fig 7a-b) .",

We demonstrated a Mxra8-dependence of the structural proteins using pseudotyped viruses. Whereas infection of CHIKV pseudotyped virions encapsidating a murine leukemia virus GFP-reporter RNA was reduced in \u0394Mxra8 compared to control MEFs, infection of EEEV or WEEV pseudotyped virions was not (Fig 2b) . Consistent with a role for Mxra8 in the entry pathway, CHIKV-AF15561 showed reduced binding at 4\u00b0C to \u0394Mxra8 compared to control MEFs, and increased binding to cells over-expressing Mxra8 (Fig 2c-d) .

Pre-incubation with Mxra8-Fc or MXRA8-2-Fc, but not the control OPG-Fc reduced CHIKV-181/25 infection in 3T3 (Fig 2e) or MRC-5 (Fig 2f) cells. We tested a panel of seven, hamster monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against mouse Mxra8 (Extended Data Fig 8b) for their capacity to inhibit CHIKV infection. All seven mAbs bound to mouse Mxra8-Fc, with four also recognizing human MXRA8-2-Fc (Extended Data Fig 8c) . Pre-treatment of 3T3 cells with anti-Mxra8 mAbs reduced CHIKV infection (Fig 2g) . Three of the mAbs that bound human MXRA8-2-Fc also reduced infection in MRC-5 cells (Extended Data Fig 8d) . To establish the importance of the Mxra8 ectodomain, we engineered forms with glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors or lacking a cytoplasmic domain (\u0394C-tail) for trans-complementation (Extended Data Fig 9) . Notably, Mxra8-GPI and Mxra8-\u0394C-tail restored CHIKV infection (Fig 2h) . Interaction with the Mxra8 ectodomain may facilitate viral glycoprotein conformational changes that are required for internalization or fusion 16 or potentiate interactions with other host factors that bridge membrane penetration and entry 17 .

Both Mxra8-Fc and MXRA8-2-Fc but not OPG-Fc bound to CHIKV virions and VLPs (Fig 3a-b) . In comparison, Mxra8-Fc and MXRA8-2-Fc did not bind efficiently to SINV-EEEV (Fig 3c) . In a complementary assay, we assessed binding of Mxra8-Fc protein to cell-surface displayed alphavirus proteins on infected cells 19, 20 . Mxra8-Fc bound CHIKV, ONNV, MAYV, RRV-infected cells, but not SINV or VEEV-infected cells (Extended Data Fig 10a-b) . We also analyzed binding of Mxra8 to CHIKV VLPs by surface plasmon resonance, and found a slow association rate, a long half-life, and an affinity of ~200 nM (Fig 3d) .",

            "text": "We evaluated whether human anti-CHIKV mAbs that bound epitopes within the E2 protein 19 altered Mxra8-Fc binding to CHIKV. Several mAbs recognizing epitopes in the A domain (2H1, 8G18, 3E23, and 1O6) or shared epitopes in the A and B domains (1H12 and 4J14) inhibited binding, whereas others localizing to distinct sites had less effect (Fig 3e) . We then tested binding of Mxra8-Fc to an alanine scanning mutagenesis library of E2 A and B domains in the context of display on the surface of 293T cells 19, 20 . Residues W64, D71, T116, and I121 in the A domain and I190, Y199, and I217 in the B domain of E2 emerged as essential for optimal Mxra8-Fc binding (Fig 3f and Supplementary Table 3 ) and overlap the binding sites of the blocking mAbs tested 19 . Mapping of these residues onto the pE2-E1 heterodimer or the trimer of heterodimers (Extended Data Fig 10c- To begin to assess the physiological importance of MXRA8 interaction with CHIKV, we tested surface expression of MXRA8 on primary human keratinocytes (KE), dermal fibroblasts (DF), synovial fibroblasts (SF), osteoblasts (OB), chondrocytes (CH), and skeletal muscle cells (SMC) (Fig 4a) , which are targets of infection by alphaviruses 24 . Pretreatment with anti-MXRA8 blocking mAbs inhibited infection of CHIKV-AF15561 in all cells but keratinocytes, which lack MXRA8 expression (Fig 4a-b) . We next evaluated whether co-injection of Mxra8-Fc with CHIKV-AF15561 would diminish infection in C57BL/6 mice. Addition of Mxra8-Fc diminished CHIKV infection in the ipsilateral ankle and muscle (Fig 4c) and reduced foot swelling (Fig 4d) compared to a control mAb. Treatment with Mxra8-Fc also inhibited ONNV infection in the ipsilateral ankle of mice (Fig 4e) . We next administered Mxra8-Fc via an intraperitoneal route and 6 h later inoculated CHIKV in the footpad. Mxra8-Fc treatment reduced foot swelling and viral burden in the ipsilateral ankle (Fig 4f-g) , although the phenotype was less than in coinjection experiments. To extend these findings, we transferred hamster anti-Mxra8 blocking or control mAbs to mice via an intraperitoneal route 12 h prior to CHIKV inoculation. Reduced CHIKV titers were observed in the ipsilateral ankle and calf muscle, and contralateral ankle at 12 and 72 h after infection in anti-Mxra8 compared to control mAbtreated mice (Fig 4h) . Treatment with anti-Mxra8 mAbs also reduced foot swelling (Fig 4i) . In post-exposure therapeutic experiments, we observed reduced CHIKV infection in the contralateral ankle and muscle when anti-Mxra8 mAbs was administered at 8 or 24 h after virus inoculation (Fig 4j and Extended Data Fig 8e) . These in vivo experiments establish a function for Mxra8 in the pathogenesis of infection of arthritogenic alphaviruses.",

After selection with puromycin for 7 days, ~1 x 10 8 cells were inoculated with CHIKV-181/25-mKate2 (MOI of 1) and then incubated for 24 h to allow nearly all cells to become infected. Cells were sorted for an absence of mKate2 expression using a Sony Biotechnology Synergy SY3200 Cell sorter (Siteman Flow Cytometry Core, Washington University). To enrich for the cell population that was resistant to CHIKV infection and increase the signal-to-noise ratio, the mKate2-negative cells were expanded in culture. Given the rapid replication rate and cytopathic effect of CHIKV, two humanized neutralizing mAbs 5 , CHK-152 and CHK-166 (2 \u03bcg/ml of each), were added to block infection by any residual virus. The expanded cells were re-infected with CHIKV-181/25-mKate2 in the absence of mAbs, sorted for mKate2 negative cells, and the procedure was repeated for one additional round.",

Virus was titrated by FFA as described 5 using mouse CHK-11 5 for CHIKV or mouse CHK-48 for ONNV as the detection antibody. Joint swelling was monitored at 72 h post infection via left foot measurements (width x height) using digital calipers as described previously 37 . Samples sizes were estimated to determine a difference of 3 to 5-fold, depending on data distribution. Blinding and randomization were not performed.",

One day later, mKate2-negative cells were sorted, and expanded in the presence of 2 \u03bcg/ml each of CHK-152 and CHK-166 neutralizing mAbs. Several days later, cells were re-inoculated with CHIKV-181/25-mKate2 without neutralizing mAbs and resorted for mKate2-negative cells. This procedure was repeated one additional time. Afterwards, genomic DNA was harvested for sgRNA sequencing and compared to the parent library for abundance (see Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 ). b.
