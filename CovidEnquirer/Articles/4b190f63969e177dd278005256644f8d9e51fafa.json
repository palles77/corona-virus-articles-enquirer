Conjunctivitis is manifested by conjunctival hyperemia, with or without chemosis, tearing and discomfort. The nictitating membrane can sometimes be elevated due to pain or swelling. The early inflammatory response is neutrophilic and a purulent ocular discharge is common. Dendritic epithelial corneal ulceration is the classic herpetic lesion and, if evident, is helpful in making the diagnosis. However, many cats with FHV-1-related ocular disease are presented with geographic epithelial ulcers. Both of these types of epithelial ulcers can be seen after staining with fluorescein. Rose Bengal will highlight dendritic ulcers, but is irritating and a topical anesthetic should be used before this stain is applied. Keratitis without corneal ulceration can also occur in cats, manifesting as corneal vascularization, with or without inflammatory cell infiltrates (Fig. 2) . Corneal disease from FHV-1 is almost always accompanied by conjunctivitis.",

However, some cats develop chronic conjunctivitis that does not resolve spontaneously.

However, a negative test does not rule out FHV-1 as the inciting agent, nor does a positive test prove that the virus is the cause of clinical signs. Several studies have demonstrated that cats with clinically normal eyes can have positive PCR results for FHV-1 from conjunctival samples (Stiles et al., 1997; Burgesser et al., 1999) . However, a positive PCR result in the face of clinical disease consistent with FHV-1 should allow the clinician to proceed with reasonable certainty of a correct diagnosis.

Any loose epithelium should be removed by debridement with a cotton swab. Grid keratotomies should not be performed in cats, as this might worsen herpetic disease and lead to formation of a corneal sequestrum (La Croix et al., 2001) .

            "text": "Available anti-herpetic drugs are summarized in Table 1 . Many of the topical anti-viral compounds are not available commercially or are available only in certain countries. Cidofovir is an intravenous drug used in human medicine for treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis (Ahmed, 2011) and is the author's preferred topical drug in cats. Compounded into a 0.5% ophthalmic solution, it is efficacious against FHV-1 and is stable when stored frozen or refrigerated for at least 6 months (Fontanelle et al., 2008; Stiles et al., 2010) . Additional benefits include lack of ocular irritation and a long tissue half-life, so that twice daily administration is adequate (Sandmeyer et al., 2005; van der Meulen et al., 2006) . Acyclovir has a low efficacy against FHV-1 compared to its efficacy against human herpes simplex virus (HSV), and is not recommended for treatment of cats (Nasisse et al., 1989; van der Meulen et al., 2006) . Idoxuridine, trifluridine and ganciclovir are all effective (Nasisse et al., 1989; Maggs and Clarke, 2004) , but need to be used 4-6 times daily and can cause ocular irritation. The use of oral famciclovir (prodrug of the active agent penciclovir), frequently used for treating HSV, has become more commonly used in cats. It has been shown to be both safe and effective for short periods of 2-3 weeks (Thomasy et al., 2011) ; however, the optimal dose remains uncertain. The most recent information indicates that 40 mg/kg three times daily is likely to be effective (Thomasy et al., 2012) , although, anecdotally, lower doses and frequencies are reported to be effective by some veterinary clinicians. A recent study of high dose topical recombinant human \u03b12b and feline \u03c9 interferon in a group of cats with naturally occurring viral keratoconjunctivitis found no beneficial effect of either interferon compared to placebo (Slack et al., 2013) ; thus, this treatment cannot be recommended.",

In a placebo controlled experimental study, cats receiving 500 mg l-lysine every 12 h had less severe conjunctivitis than control cats (Stiles et al., 2002) . In a study in which shelter cats were given 250 mg (kittens) or 500 mg (adults) l-lysine once daily in food, there was no difference in URTD in treated cats compared to untreated cats (Rees and Lubinski, 2008) . In another study, shelter cats fed a diet high in l-lysine (5.7%) had no difference in the frequency of URTD signs compared to cats eating a diet with basal levels of l-lysine (1.7%) (Drazenovich et al., 2009 ).

However, a recent study of 99 cats with URTD, as well as ocular surface disease, found that ocular samples analyzed using PCR were positive for FCV alone in 11 (11.1%) cats; in 19 (19.2%) cats, FCV was present with other infectious agents, including FHV-1 (Gerriets et al., 2012) . Moderate to severe conjunctivitis with conjunctival epithelial erosions, as well as oral mucosal ulceration, were noted in FCV-positive cats. No corneal ulcers were noted in cats infected with only FCV.

Specific anti-viral treatment with phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers has been used in FCV outbreaks, reducing viral shedding and hastening clinical recovery (Smith et al., 2008) . A topical ophthalmic anti-viral agent should be used when it is unknown whether FCV or FHV-1 (or both) are present.

In 12 cats experimentally infected with FIV, virus was recovered from the aqueous humor of three animals, and a perivascular lymphoplasmacytic uveitis was noted in all nine animals euthanased \u22654 weeks post-infection (Ryan et al., 2003) . The magnitude and distribution of lesions in the eyes and brain did not correlate with viral loads. In a study of 15 naturally infected cats that had been euthanased, anterior uveitis was documented in 13 (Loesenbeck et al., 1996) . The presence of extravascular IgG and complement component C3 suggested that immune complexes might play a role in anterior uveitis in FIV-positive cats. Nine cats with naturally occurring FIV had ocular lesions, including anterior uveitis, secondary glaucoma and inflammation of the pars plana of the ciliary body (English et al., 1990) . In an experimental study on the effect of FIV on the central nervous system, neurologic abnormalities related to the visual system included anisocoria, delayed pupillary light reflex and delayed visual evoked potentials (Phillips et al., 1994) .",

When FeSV was injected into the anterior chamber of kittens, a pattern of iridal melanotic lesions occurred that progressed from distinct flat areas to raised infiltrative melanomas, very much like the naturally occurring anterior uveal melanomas of cats (Albert, 1980) . In a study of 36 enucleated globes of cats with a diagnosis of diffuse anterior uveal melanoma, PCR identified three samples that were positive for FeLV-FeSV proviral DNA sequences (Stiles et al., 1999) .
