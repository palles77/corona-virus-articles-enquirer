            "text": "The word 'sustainable' is not as new to the forestry profession, including forest economists, as it may be to some mainstream economists, specifically Rust Belt (Chicago/Rochester and their satellites) economists. Sustainability, according to Rust Belt economists, is simply not an appropriate topic to be discussed by economists (Colander, 2004) . However, forest economists can be proud of their long familiarity with this word. The Faustmann Formula, which is one of the main pillars of conventional forest economics and which has been characterized as 'One Formula Myriad Conclusions' by Cheng, 2001 in the Editorial of this Journal, Volume 2, is based on the sustained supply of timber for an infinite number of rotations. In the last two decades, the world has realized that 'trees are not forests and forests are much more than trees', and sustained yield timber management (SYTM) alone is insufficient for the sustainability of forests. The scope of the word 'sustainable', in a forestry context, has been extended beyond timber and the new and evolving paradigm of forest management, known as Sustainable Forest Management (SFM), is based on the principles of sustainability of forests. Some traditionalists, including some forest economists who prefer to align themselves with Rust Belt economists, may challenge the validity of SFM on the grounds of lack of clarity and of a clear definition, and additionally some may not recognize the difference between SYTM and SFM. However, a definition is merely a means of better understanding a reality, and the lack of a unique definition cannot negate its existence. A variety of definitions of 'forest' as well as of 'economics' do not preclude further consideration of both 'forest' and 'economics'. SFM is a reality in this century and it will continue to be so whether we reach agreement on its definition or not.",

In the short-term, human beliefs are influenced by the existing social, cultural, ecological and environmental conditions while in the long-term these conditions are in turn influenced by human behavior. Hence, there is a continuous interaction between human beliefs and values, and the surrounding conditions. These interactions lead to the dynamic nature of human beliefs and values, as well as social, cultural, economic, and environmental conditions, which in turn contribute to the dynamic nature of concepts. The concept of SFM is an outcome of dynamism in the human value system, and a reflection of social, cultural, economic, and environmental conditions of the late twentieth and early twenty-first century, which are quite different from the conditions of the nineteenth and early twentieth century. The management principles and silviculture of SFM are going to be quite different from the management principles and silviculture of SYTM. Similarly, the economic principles, theory, and models of SFM need to reflect the social, cultural, economic, and environmental conditions of the twenty-first century and the management principles and silviculture of SFM.",

The concept of SFM recognizes diversity of preferences across agents, communities, time, and generations, and incorporates preferences that are revealed through the market as well as through non-market mechanisms. Forests, in the context of SFM, are valuable for their physical products as well as their contributions to ecosystem functioning. However, the paradigm of economics of SYTM, which has its roots in the conventional paradigm of economics, is based on a utility maximizing rational agent and the 'invisible hand' leading to an efficient general equilibrium. In this framework, peoples' preferences are uniform, static and revealed through the market only; society is a mathematical aggregation of homogeneous agents, public inputs are through market signals, all systems can be commoditized which converts systems into functionally-disjointed and discrete units, and there are no commitments and moral judgments attached to the domains of forest values. It is evident that the basic premises of the economics of SYTM are almost wholly in contradiction to the realities and expectations of SFM, and the economics of SFM will require an extension of the boundaries of forest economics.",

            "text": "Keeping the unique features of SFM and the need to extend the boundaries of forest economics in perspective, I published, 'Extending the boundaries of forest economics' in Volume 5 (Kant, 2003) of this journal. My experience in the publication of this article was similar to the experience of Prof. Ronald Coase (Coase, 1960) in publishing his Nobel Prize winning article-'The Problem of Social Cost' and Prof. Brian Arthur's (Arthur, 1989 ) experience in publishing his Schumpeter Prize winning work on the 'Economics of Increasing Returns'. However, I took an easier route by moving from one journal to another and I was fortunate to find accepting reviewers and an Editor, within the short period of 3 years. Surprisingly, after publication of the article I found that there are many other forest and resource economists who share my arguments. Encouraging responses from these colleagues enhanced my desire to contribute to the process of transforming forest economics from the economics of SYTM to the economics of SFM. I proposed to my colleagues in International Union of Forestry Research Organizations (IUFRO), Prof. Maurizio Merlo and Prof. Hans A. Joebstl, to organize an annual conference of IUFRO Groups 4.04.02 and 4.13.00 on the theme of Economics of SFM in May 2003 at the University of Toronto. Both colleagues happily accepted the offer. As we began our preparations, we received over-whelming support from colleagues in both forestry and economics professions and from various agencies -Canadian Forest Service, Ford Foundation, Forest Products Association of Canada, International Paper, Living Legacy Trust, Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, Sustainable Forest Management Network, and Weyerhaeuser Canada. As a result, the proposed conference took the shape of a major international conference and we received more than one hundred abstracts from forest economists working in over 40 countries. As these scholars were getting ready to take their flights to the conference, the city of Toronto was responding to an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and we have to reschedule the conference to May 2004. Unfortunately, during this intervening period we lost our great friend and outstanding forest economist Prof. Maurizio Merlo. This was a great loss to many of us personally as well as to our profession and I would like to dedicate this special volume to Prof. Merlo.",

He compares the attributes of SFM with conventional forest management (CFM), which I have called SYTM, and observes that: CFM is disciplinary but SFM is transdisciplinary; CFM is homogeneous but SFM heterogeneous; CFM is hierarchical and favors an explicit form of structure whereas SFM is less hierarchical and more transient; and SFM is more socially accountable and reflexive than CFM. These features of SFM restrain the use of standard economic tools and thus an analytical framework for the economics of SFM is to be pluralistic and integrative. He proposes an integrative and contextualized knowledge-based twotier approach for the economics of SFM, in which economic incentives and trade-offs dictate resource allocation and management decisions when sustainable products are involved, but precautionary principles would prevail when the integrity of ecosystem is at stake.",

The author presents the outcomes of a series of economic experiments in rural communities of Columbia conducted to examine individuals' behavior, in a group setting, with respect to endogenously emerging self-governing rules within groups vs. externally imposed rules, when facing the typical tragedy of the commons. The experiments included two external regulations (high and low penalties and only 20% of the players monitored), and a selfgoverned system. Both the external regulations generated very similar results regardless of the level of the penalty and they induced behaviors very similar to those achieved by the self-governed treatment. Hence, the author argues that individuals do not seem to follow entirely the conventional economic prediction about externally imposed rules, and people in rural communities can develop norms based on non-enforceable rules of cooperation which may prove as effective as externally imposed rules in SFM.",

The authors argue that the conventional forest sector forecasting models, which ignore landowner heterogeneity due to their differing preferences for nontimber amenities and varying management responses, can generate biased projections of future forest use and landscapes. The authors evaluate the extent of bias from the conventional forest sector models, by (i) modifying Sub-regional Timber Supply Model (SRTS) to reflect heterogeneity attributed to timber supply and amenity demand; and (ii) utilizing empirically validated model parameters that reflect this heterogeneity, for 12 southern states of the USA. The authors find that the conventional models will estimate lower timber prices, higher harvests and substantially higher inventory for softwood species, and higher prices, lower harvests, and higher inventory for hardwood species.

The authors explore the effects of uncertainty on the costs of adjacency restrictions in a two-stands real-options model and examine the optimal harvest rules under adjacency restrictions and uncertainty.

Kant and Lee demonstrate the relevance of the social choice approach, which has not been commonly used in forest economics, to address the problems associated with the valuation of non-market values of forests and diverse preferences of different stakeholders for these values. Cardenas demonstrates the use of Experimental Economics, not common in the forest economic literature; to discover the actual behavior pattern of individual agents in group settings and to prove that social norms, based on non-enforceable rules of cooperation, may be as effective as externally imposed rules in SFM. Subhrendu et al. address the heterogeneity of preferences of forest landowners and demonstrate that the heterogeneity of preferences can be incorporated, at least to some extent, in the conventional forest economic models. Similarly, Malchow-M\u00f8ller, Strange, and Thorsen demonstrate the use of another conventional economic approach -the real-options approach-to address the issue of adjancency constraints.

Using the panel Granger-Causality Test, the author finds that there is no causal relationship between FDI and gross domestic product (GDP) or between FDI and wage level in the developed countries; however, there is a bi-directional causality between FDI and GDP in developing countries. The author further finds that in developed countries the roundwood supply does not Granger-cause the FDI but the FDI does cause the roundwood supply, indicating that the FDI could potentially encourage unsustainable use of the forests in these countries. The causal relationship in the developing countries was from roundwood supply to FDI suggesting that policies encouraging forestry operations could attract foreign direct investments to the forest sector in these countries.

The authors' most important finding is that higher harvesting quotas lead to declines in forest growth over time, and the area of state natural forests and plantations also prove to be negative predictors of forest growth rates. The authors observe that their results support a large body of anecdotal, but untested, evidence regarding the size of China's state forest enterprises and deforestation within the country.",

            "text": "In the fourth paper, Can Liu and Runsheng Yin analyze, using the output distance function and data envelopment analysis, the productivity of rural households in Jinzhai county of China. The authors find that most of the households improved their productivity in the 1980s, only a small number did so throughout the period of 1978 -1997, and there were wide variations among the households. For the group as a whole, however, its productivity growth and income increase are abysmal, and this is well reflected in forestry, whose potential in reducing poverty and improving livelihoods has been constrained by government market control. The authors also find that the adoption of the household responsibility system was an important factor driving the productivity growth in the early 1980s, but the uncertainty associated with the contract expiration/renewal in the early 1990s led to productivity decline. Hence, removing institutional and technical impediments is essential to reduce poverty.",

The author observes that in a country-in-transition, forestry is also in transition since it is undergoing principal changes toward a market economy, and the recipients of private benefits usually do not repay the society in full for the costs of their activities and negative externalities caused by their actions. The author analyses transition performance in the Ukraine's forestry, provides evidence of the obstacles to the required changes, and makes a number of observations about the connection between SFM and the economic transition of the country to a market economy.",

The authors suggest a step-wise methodology for economic analysis of the potential of the biomass-energy sector. The methodology has two main components: (i) the evaluation of the availability of biomass resources according to environmentally sustainable approaches and to economic efficiency of the collection operations; and (ii) the analysis of business structures, which can be fitted in the sector, and of the correspondent supply areas. The authors use the methodology for the Tuscany region of Italy and identify biomass supply basins, different than that of the administrative and territorial units. The authors suggest that these basins should be used as basic units for institutional and policy interventions related to biomass-based ecologically-sound economic development.",

However, all these issues may have important implications for SFM and may result in different SFM outcomes in different social, economic, and cultural conditions. Hence, the economic aspects of these issues may be critical for the economics of SFM.",

            "text": "Finally, the seventeen papers included in this volume provide considerable evidence of the complexity and multi-dimensionality of economic issues associated with SFM. The complexity of issues is so intense that it was difficult to distribute seventeen papers in four or five sections. The current distribution may not be globally efficient but it is locally efficient because the distribution is based on my limited knowledge (bounded rationality) and my preferences for different aspects of SFM. However, irrespective of the distribution and organization of the papers, every paper has added to our understanding, directly or indirectly, of the economic issues of SFM. Some papers have looked at the issue at the global-level while many have examined the issues at national or regional-level. Similarly, some papers have argued for the use or have used new approaches while others have extended the use of conventional approaches to SFM specific issues. The diversity of approaches used in these papers suggests that the economics of SFM will require the extension of the boundaries of forest economics in two dimensions-use of existing conventional tools to analyze the SFM specific issues and the development of new economic theories, models, and tools to capture the main features of SFM. Hence, the economics of SFM will be a complement to, and not a substitute for, the existing paradigm of economics of SYTM. This special issue is just the beginning of a new paradigm, and the papers in this volume merely scratch the surface of SFM. I am sure that in the next 15 -20 years, we will see many papers and books on these issues.",
