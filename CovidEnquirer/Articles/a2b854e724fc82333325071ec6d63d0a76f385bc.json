            "text": "immune system becomes weaker, and the person is more susceptible to infections. AIDS is the most advanced stage of the HIV infection and could be reached in 10-15 years from the infection. It can be transmitted only by some body fluids: blood, semen, preseminal fluid, rectal fluid, vaginal fluid, and breast milk. The data from the World Health Organization (WHO) have confirmed the dangerousness of the HIV, an estimated 1.2 million of people have died of AIDS-related illnesses worldwide in 2014 (last update); in the same period the number of people living with HIV-AIDS was about 37 million. A significant aspect is that only 54% of people with HIV is aware of the infection. Currently no vaccine exists and the treatment consists in standard antiretroviral therapy to maximally suppress the HIV virus and stop its progression; use of condom and regular analysis of the subjects belonging to risk categories could help in contrasting the spread of this pandemia. The HIV/AIDS virus suitably represents the situation at hand: a virus spreading all over the world but with different levels of dangerousness depending on the population interested; the social, economic, and cultural habits may strongly vary the dynamics among the different categories of subjects. The HIV/AIDS is generally studied by considering compartmental modeling, that is, dividing the population into groups homogeneous with respect to the level of disease, as discussed in the following sections. In general susceptible individuals and infected ones are considered, splitting each class depending on the specific characteristics to be discussed; due to the long nonsymptom period, among the infected individuals there are those who are not aware of their situation and the ones in the pre-AIDS and AIDS conditions. Due to its dangerousness, an effective control is required to interrupt the spread, by putting together two characteristics: wise behavior and the fast detection of the infection so that the virus does not spread. Three possible actions are suggested by the WHO; they represent different levels of prevention: l Primary prevention: It is designed for healthy people to reduce the possibility of new infections. l Secondary prevention: It is devoted to a fast identification of new infections and risk conditions to improve the percentage of subjects who become aware of their illness by regular blood tests. l Tertiary prevention: It is the medication to the infected subjects who are aware of infection.",

In Section 3, mathematical model referring to a single society is described, whereas in Sections 4 and 5, the model analysis is developed in the absence of control and with constant inputs, respectively. The interactions between populations are deeply described in Section 6, whereas the effects of migration parameters on the individual's evolutions are developed in Section 7. A final discussion of the proposed results is in Section 8; and some conclusions along with future work outlines are in Section 9. by splitting the S class considering the subjects who are not aware of irresponsible acts and, therefore, could contract the virus, and the subjects representing the wise population who, suitably informed, try to avoid dangerous behaviors. Therefore, in the considered approach, the first level of prevention corresponds to the information effort and the use of wise attitudes to assist the noninfected subjects in avoiding the acquisition of the HIV infection. The interaction between populations with different diseases is an interesting topic in a globalized world and requires prompt suitable action (Dadlani et al., 2014; Naresh et al., 2009; Tanaka and Urabe, 2014) . A survey on the possible approaches to face the problem of spreading processes was presented by Nowzari et al. (2016) ; in particular, the concepts of network and metapopulation models are discussed, as well as deterministic and stochastic ones. It is also emphasized that the same kind of modeling could be efficiently applied to spreading processing regarding information propagation through social network, viral marketing, and malware spreading.",

With such a classification, the first group is mainly responsible for the virus propagation. In addition to the susceptible individuals, the model considers the infected subjects, I, the individuals who are infected but do not know their illness status. They represent the most dangerous class, since they can have sexual relationships with the unwise susceptible individuals S 1 and so spread the infection. The diagnosed patients are divided into two classes: the P class and the A class, the first one represents the individuals who are diagnosed with HIV (pre-AIDS) condition, the latter contain the ones with a diagnosis of AIDS.",

This analysis is motivated by observing that interactions with other groups can be also represented by suitable inputs (migrations, travels, daily movements across the borders, etc.). Then, preliminary, the inner controls u 1 and u 2 are introduced and their effects are studied.

In all the figures, the case u 2 \u00bc 0, the uncontrolled case, is depicted by the dashed line, for comparative purpose with the other increasing values. Figs. 10 and 11 show the time histories of the two state components S 1 (t) and I(t), for different input values. Although monotonical increment in the individuals S 1 (t) as u 2 increases is expected, as well as the corresponding decrement in the infected subjects I(t), there are two interesting results which the figures show. The first is the appearance of the oscillatory behavior which is related to the amplitude of the input u 2 . This kind of time evolution is well evidenced referring to Fig. 14, where the trajectories in the plane I(t) + P(t) + A(t) versus S 1 (t) + S 2 (t) is plotted: the spiral trajectory while converging to the equilibrium point is clearly visible. This means that, under input u 2 6 \u00bc 0, there are time instants in which the number of the infected individuals I(t) can seem greater than expected, but it is related to the transient behavior only. The second result puts in evidence from the numerical simulations is that the number of diagnosed infected individuals P(t) and A(t) do not decrease as I(t) decreases. This is due to the fact that the action of the control u 2 aims at increasing the number of diagnoses, so that while I(t) decreases, people moves to P(t) (Fig. 12) and A(t) (Fig. 13) . The overall effects on the total population is shown in Fig. 15 , where its increment is clear. While the total population increases, the fraction of healthy people S 1 (t) + S 2 (t) with respect to the total population strongly increases, as reported in Fig. 16 and, at the same time, the fraction of diagnosed patients P(t) + A(t) significantly decreases (Fig. 17) .

The evolution of S 2 (t) is not reported because for the initial condition chosen it is constant and equal to zero. Also the time histories of P(t) and A(t) are omitted since they have the same shape of I(t). The obvious result that can be evidenced from Fig. 27 is that the number of healthy people increases as m 1 grows; unfortunately, this increment makes the infected individuals I(t) grow too. However, a very interesting behavior of the system can be observed once the evolution of the fraction of diagnosed infected patients P(t) + A(t) w.r.t. the total population is determined, varying m 1 , as reported in Fig. 29 . From these plots it can be seen that, under the hypothesis of an immigration of healthy people driven by the health of the total population, the different values of m 1 affects the transient behavior only, reaching, for all m 1 , the same steady-state value. The same result can be observed in Fig. 30 , where the fraction of the healthy population S 1 (t) + S 2 (t) w.r.t. the total one is reported: also in this case, the steady-state value is the same. Thus, it is possible to conclude that, for the model considered, an immigration of healthy individuals makes the population grow, as evidenced in Fig. 31 ; each of the classes grows (Figs. 27 and 28) but the fraction of healthy population as well as the fraction of infected one tends to remain unchanged even if the rate of immigration (m 1 ) increases.",

Following the same order as in the previous cases, Figs. 42 and 43 depict the time history of S 1 (t) and I(t), respectively. As expected, the steady-state values of the uninfected individuals S 1 (t) increase while for the infected I(t) a more sensible decrement could be observed. The transient, as in the case of emigration from S 1 (t), is characterized by a high oscillatory behavior, in this case more accentuated than that shown in Figs. 32 and 33. Correspondingly, the fraction of diagnosed infected people with respect to the total population decreases for higher values of n 3 and, at the same time, the relative number of uninfected individuals increases, once their steady-state behavior is observed as shown in Figs. 43 and 45. But in the same figures, the transients show a very large variations in the components. This fact proves the necessity to have a reliable mathematical model to be able to predict some unexpected behaviors or to explain the presence of values in some time intervals that, intuitively, are not obvious. This is well evidenced in Fig. 46 , in which, without the support of a model, it is not easy to justify the large variations in the total population as the time passes.",

(ii) Emigration involving the same population as in Case (i) implies an evolution opposite to the previous one, with a decrement in people in all classes, leading, at steady state, again to constant ratios, but with the presence of oscillations in the transient. This peculiar behavior is interesting to be stressed since there are time intervals with increment in individuals, healthy and infected, despite the emigration phenomena. This fact does not characterizes the behavior of the dynamics when the vaccination, which acts on the same subjects, is applied. (iii) When the immigration involves infected people unaware of their status, the effect is the expected one: the number of healthy people decreases while all the infected ones increase. This produces an increment in the total population, but it is due to a higher number of infected individuals.",

These results are obtained starting from the development of the analysis for the single group dynamics modeling each interaction as additional inputs and/or changes in the parameter values. Such effects can be modeled as constant fluxes, which introduce additive constant terms in the dynamics, or can be supposed to be driven by some characteristic of the group behavior, such as a higher or lower level of healthy, for example. As case study, the epidemic spread considered is the HIV-AIDS, assuming a new model in which the classical scheme that includes susceptible people and three classes of infected ones (infected but not aware of their status, patients in the pre-AIDS and AIDS conditions) is enriched by splitting the class of susceptible individuals into those aware of the risks of this virus and those who adopt irresponsible acts. The proposed analysis, particularly suitable in describing, for the chosen model, the migration phenomena, is useful to predict unexpected behaviors especially in the transient period in which oscillatory behaviors for the classes of infected patients appear, as evidenced in the discussion. Since all the results presented are highly dependent on the model structure and parameter values, future developments should involve real data analysis and model validation. Moreover, the explicit introduction of the detailed interactions between more than one population is mandatory for putting in evidence the migration fluxes. This is preparatory for the introduction of a control strategy for reducing the spread of virus between populations despite the globalization needs.",
