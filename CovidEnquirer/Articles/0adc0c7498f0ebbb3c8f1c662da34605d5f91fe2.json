            "text": "COPD has become a major cause of chronic morbidity and mortality throughout the world, and the economic and social burden are projected to increase in the coming decades. 1 Hospitalization for acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) is recognized as a major event in the natural history of COPD due to its adverse effect on lung function, survival, risk of readmission, and quality of life. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] It is generally believed that exacerbations are important targets for treatments and prevention of disease progression of COPD. 7 Exploration of causative phenotypes of exacerbations would identify differences in population characteristics and clinical outcomes, which can lead to therapeutic consequences. 8 Respiratory infection is recognized as an important trigger for AECOPD, and has also been shown to be associated with more severe disease. However, little is known about the spectrum of virus and bacteria of respiratory tract of AECOPD.",

Standardized pulmonary function test was performed with a dry spirometer device (Erich Jaeger GmbH, Hoechberg, Germany) at 15 minutes after inhaling salbutamol 400 \u00b5g (Ventolin, GlaxoS-mithKline, London, UK), and the FVC, FEV 1 , and FEV 1 /FVC ratio were recorded.

Our detection rates of respiratory viruses were in line with recent reports, but two to three times higher than that using the conventional viral culture methods. 16, 17 The discrepancy could be explained by the use of Luminex multiplex PCR technique since this examining system allows the inclusion of new viruses such as human metapneumovirus and bocavirus in the more recent studies. Our study found that influenza virus is the most common virus associated with AECOPD, consistent with our results, a study from Hong Kong has shown influenza to be the most detected virus in exacerbations of COPD, 18 which supports our results that influenza virus might be the most causative agent in the exacerbations of COPD in Asia. However, picornavirus was the most common one in studies from Western countries. 16 This disparity in distribution of virus could be related to the geographical variation or different strains circulating at that particular year and time. Alternatively, the wider coverage of influenza vaccination in Western countries compared to Asia may also contribute to the difference of virus seen in the study. 19, 20 Interestingly, our study also detected five patients infected with human metapneumovirus and six patients with bocavirus in AECOPD for the first time, which provides a new insight into understanding of etiological agents in AECOPD. Further studies are needed to explore these less well-studied etiological pathogens for AECOPD. Potential bacterium was detected in 21% of acute exacerbation events, demonstrating the predominance of P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, and Klebsiella. Although we strictly followed the standard procedure to collect specimens, the detection rate with conventional examination method was relatively lower than modern culture-independent molecular approach, which could identify many unrecognized bacterial species in samples from COPD patients that may be clinically relevant. 21 This bacterial spectrum was generally in agreement with those reported previously in People's Republic of China. 22 The difference with that of Western countries could be due to the regional disparity of bacterial infection.",

LOS has been widely used to measure the acute impact on patients with AECOPD. 23 Our results showed the longest LOS for coinfection group and shortest LOS for the non-infectious group, which was consistent with previously reports. 8, 24 Wilkinson et al 25 had demonstrated that exacerbation symptoms and FEV 1 decline were more severe in the presence of bacteria and colds (as a surrogate of viral infection) than with a cold or bacterial pathogen alone. Exacerbations associated with human rhinovirus and Haemophilus influenzae coinfection exhibited a greater bacterial load and inflammation than those with no infection or viral or bacterial infection alone. These results showed that viral and bacterial coinfection would lead to a more severe symptom and longer LOS for patients to recover, which inversely increases chances of nosocomial infection, and also social and economic burden dramatically. Therefore, we may conclude that the different infectious phenotypes are closely associated with different LOS and health status in AECOPD patients. It is worth mentioning that some researches have found that cardiovascular events, pulmonary embolism, and blood stream infections may also contribute to the prolonged stay in patients with COPD. 9,26 However, we did not check all of the relevant factors or diseases associated with prolonged stay in hospital which may have an impact on our results. We will take it into consideration in future study.",

Therefore, we hypothesized that there may be a correlation between respiratory infectious phenotypes and CAT, which has not been explored yet. Since patients with coinfection exhibited a greater inflammation than those with single infection or non-infection, we infer that coinfection would lead to a higher CAT score, which was supported by our results. Furthermore, we also found that CAT was positively correlated with LOS, which makes CAT a useful tool to assess the impact of AECOPD symptoms on health status.",

There was, however, no statistically significant difference which was in agreement with some previous researches. [27] [28] [29] Wark et al 30 has demonstrated that there was no difference in acute FEV 1 between those with and without virus infection. At review 6 weeks following their admission, those with virus infection had a greater decline in lung function compared with those without a virus having been isolated. How this occurs still need further investigation. Furthermore, a study investigating the relationship between potentially pathogenic bacteria isolation frequency and GOLD stages in AECOPD found no relationship between stage and bacteria isolation, which bear some resemblance to our research. 28 Mortality is the most important parameter in predicting prognosis. Two patients infected with influenza virus died in our study. Researches had showed that influenza virus pandemic poses a potentially grave public health threat because of the high mortality rates observed in infected people. 31 Therefore, whether respiratory influenza viral infection could be attributed to mortality of COPD exacerbations still needs further investigation.",
