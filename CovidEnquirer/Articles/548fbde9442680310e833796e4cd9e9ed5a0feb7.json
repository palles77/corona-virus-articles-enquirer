The probe cross-hybridized in the dot blot assay with nucleic acid of a closely related feline coronavirus, feline enteric coronavirus (FECV)-79-1683. To construct the probe, a 2.5 kilobase cDNA, prepared from FIPV-DF2 genomic RNA, was molecularly cloned. The recombinant cDNA clone was digested with the restriction endonuclease Rsa I, and an 870 basepair Rsa 1 fragment was isolated from vector DNA by agarose electrophoresis and glassmilk purification. This fragment was complementary to the 3' three fourths of the nucleocapsid gene. The hybridization probe was prepared by random primed labeling in the presence of biotin-I 1-dUTP. Using an avidinalkaline phosphatase conjugate and chemilumineseent substrate detection system, virus could be detected in as few as 3000 infected cells.",

Viral RNA could be detected in as few as 12 000 PBML isolated from cats at PID 7 and in 50 000 PBML at PID 22. There was no consistent pattern, however, between hybridization results and prognosis or severity of disease at the time of sampling.

The effusive form is characterized by the accumulation of fluid in one or more of the body cavities, while the noneffusive form is characterized instead by development of granulomatous lesions in various organs (Pedersen, 1987b) . The noneffusive form of FIP can be difficult to diagnose clinically, because many feline diseases present in a similar manner (August, 1984) . The FIPV is related antigenically to and crossreacts serologically with feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), canine coronavirus (CCV), and the human coronavirus 229E ( Pedersen et al., 1978; Horzinek et al., 1982; Pedersen and Black, 1983) . Because cats become infected subclinically with various coronaviruses, serological crossreactions between FIPV and other coronaviruses complicate diagnosis of FIP using standard antibody tests (Barlough, 1984; 1985) . Homologous reactions after subclinical infections by FIPV may also complicate the interpretation of serological assays.",

Weiss and Scott (198 la) demonstrated by animal inoculation studies that either whole blood or peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBML) from cats with FIP are infectious to other cats and can transmit FIP. Experimental infection of SPF cats with the non-FIP producing enteric virus, FECV, results in a limited distribution of virus from the primary site of infection, the mature columnar epithelial cells in the upper third of the villi in the small intestinal mucosa. Virus is demonstrated occasionally in monocytic cells within the medullary sinuses of the mesenteric lymph nodes (Pedersen et al., 1981; Pedersen, 1987; Evermann et al., 1988 ) ; in contrast to FIP, there is no evidence that FECV can induce a systemic disease (Pedersen et al., 1981 ) .",

Four micrograms of FIPV-DF2 RNA were converted into RNA-cDNA hybrids by reverse transcriptase, using oligodeoxythymidine for priming. Resulting hybrids were converted into double-stranded DNA by RNase H together with DNA polymerase I and Escherichia coli DNA ligase and blunt-ended by T4 DNA polymerase. The double-stranded cDNA was ligated to BstX I linkers, inserted into the BstX I site of the pcDNAII phagemid (Invitrogen), and propagated in E. coli INV 1 alpha F'cells (Invitrogen). One recombinant cDNA clone, H 1A3, was characterized by restriction enzyme analysis and partial DNA sequencing. This clone represents 2500 bases near the 3' end of the FIPV-DF2 genomic RNA (Fig. 1 ). The recombinant phagemid containing H 1 A3 was digested with Rsa I and the fragments separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. An 870 bp fragment complementary to the 3' three fourths of the N protein gene ( Fig. 1 ) was excised and purified from the gel using glassmilk (Geneclean II, Bio 101, La Jolla, CA). This fragment was labeled with biotin by random primer extension using hexanucleotide primers and Klenow enzyme in the presence of biotin-1 I-dUTP (Tropix, Bedford, MA) to make the hybridization probe, FIPV-Rsa I.",

The decreasing intensity of signals seen for FECV-79-1683, FIPV-UCD 1 and FIPV-UCD2, compared to FIPV-DF2 or 79-1146, may have been due either to less homology between nucleotide sequences or possibly to a lower number of viral copies per cell, particularly with virus strains, such as UCDI, that replicate more slowly in cell culture (data not shown).",

Comparison of amino acid sequences derived from the RNA polymerase gene of TGEV to amino acid sequences derived from the RNA polymerase gene of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) revealed a high level of homology; this is in contrast to the low levels of homology between TGEV and IBV structural proteins (Britton, et al., 1990; Wesley, 1990) .

Previous studies indicate that cats infected with these viruses most likely have only a localized enteric infection and do not have a viremia (Pedersen et al., 1981; Barlough et al., 1984; Pedersen and Floyd, 1985 ) . PBML will be probed by FISH using our FIPV-cDNA probes to determine whether or not coronaviral RNA is present. If it can be shown that viral nucleic acids are in PBML of cats with FIP and are not in PBML from cats infected with non-FIP-producing coronaviruses, cDNA probes which crosshybridize between FIPV and FECV may still be valuable diagnostic tools.",

It is our opinion that this assay can be used to diagnose acute FIPV infections, particularly in viremic cats. Tests that can detect virus or virus-associated components (e.g., proteins or nucleic acids) are preferable to diagnostic tests based on serological reactions. This is particularly true in disease states such as FIP, where anticoronavirus antibody crossreactivity or homologous reactions after subclinical infections by FIPV complicate the interpretation of serological assays. Further refinements in sensitivity and specificity of the in situ hybridization assay should facilitate specific detection of FIPV RNA and result in a clinically useful diagnostic test for FIP.",
