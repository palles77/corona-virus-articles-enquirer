It has been suggested recently that the virus may have spread directly from birds to humans. 2 In fact, a recent study of the 1918 influenza polymerase gene sequences, suggests this virus was very likely derived from an avian source and it seems to have some very similar characteristics to the present H5N1 virus. 3 The years 1957 and 1968 brought two more influenza A pandemics. Viral isolates from these outbreaks contained components of both human and avian influenza viruses, reinforcing the idea that pandemics occur after a mixing of two formerly species-specific influenza viruses in a host susceptible to both strains. Little is known about the best way to respond to an inevitable influenza pandemic.",

This particular outbreak took place concurrently with an outbreak of the same strain of virus in the poultry population of Hong Kong. 6 Scientists determined that all cases had had close contact with infected poultry. Further genetic studies showed that in all likelihood, the virus had jumped directly from birds to humans. 6 Quick response by Chinese authorities led to the destruction of Hong Kong's entire poultry population (around 1.5 million birds).

Therefore, the viruses are thought to mix with each other within pigs. It is thought that in Southeast Asia, where humans live and interact in close proximity to poultry and pigs, the environment may be favorable for antigenic shift to occur. More recently researchers have suggested that for some avian influenza viruses, humans themselves may serve as the \"test tube\" in which mixing may occur. 6 That is, if a human is concurrently infected with both an avian influenza A virus and a human strain, the two may mix and produce a novel strain more easily transmitted among humans. If such a mixing were to occur with a high pathogenic strain, such as H5N1, the results may be a global pandemic.",

Transmission of viruses from animals to humans depends on the characteristics of the pathogen, the concentration of infected host animals, and how often humans come in contact with the infected hosts. 12 In large portions of Southeast Asia, it is common practice for whole households to live and work in very close contact with poultry and other animals. Because the avian influenza A (H5N1) virus is known to be transmitted through contact with infected bird oral secretions and feces, these close living relationships facilitate interspecies transmission.

They presented with symptoms including fever, Figure 4 Reproduced from World Health Organization Regional Office for the Western Pacific. Communicable disease surveillance and response.

They were admitted to a hospital on days two through six after onset of symptoms. All experienced respiratory failure and required intubation at a median of seven days (range, 4 to 10 days) after onset of illness. Three of the children died two to four weeks after onset of symptoms, and one child and the adult died eight days after onset of symptoms. 14 One theory explaining the high mortality rate, especially in the young and previously healthy, is a pronounced activation of the immune response. This leads to activation of the proinflammatory cytokine cascade and inflammatory response contributing to tissue damage. Most fatal cases have had evidence of multisystem organ failure and ARDS. 16 Symptoms of more common human influenza viruses begin two to three days after exposure to the virus with an acute febrile respiratory illness including cough, headache, fatigue, and myalgia for three to four days, and symptoms may persist for up to two weeks. Subsequent symptoms may include pharyngitis, nasal congestion, rhinitis, cough, cervical lymphadenopathy, conjunctivitis, and sometimes gastrointestinal symptoms. At-risk patients may progress to pneumonia and shock. However, the avian influenza A (H5N1) infection seems to be much more aggressive and fast acting than the typical human influenza infection, progressing to respiratory distress within a few days of onset of symptoms. 4, 9, 10, 14 ",

Hoffman-La Roche Ltd Pharmaceuticals Division, Basel, Switzerland). Amantadine and rimantadine are effective against type A influenza virus only, the type that H5N1 belongs to. However, testing of human isolates from H5N1 infected patients has shown resistance to amantadine and rimantadine; therefore, treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors (zanamivir or oseltamivir) should be initiated early. 17 There has been a report of an H5N1 isolate resistant to oseltamivir in Viet Nam. 16 There have been no controlled clinical trials to study the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors for the treatment of human avian influenza infections. The use of these medications for avian influenza infections is based on animal experiments where they have been shown to decrease mortality from H5N1 infections. 16 There is anecdotal evidence that initiation of treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors early may decrease mortality in human infections. 18 Stockpiling or hoarding of these medications may lead to public health problems and inability to distribute medications to areas of need. The health authorities have plans to ensure distribution of these medications to areas of need if epidemics arise.",

Probably the two highest yield measures for prevention of an H5N1 pandemic are to stop epidemics within avian populations and vaccination of persons at high risk of exposure to infected poultry with existing influenza vaccines. These two measures would decrease human exposure to H5N1 and decrease likelihood of mixing of H5N1 with human-specific viruses. The WHO specifically recommends workers involved in the culling of poultry flocks take protective measures to decrease exposure to bird excrement. Protective clothing and gear as well as proper cleaning of surfaces must be employed. The WHO also reports that poultry workers in areas with outbreaks should receive antiviral drugs as prophylaxis. Proper reporting to local and state officials is a must when cases of avian influenza are found in humans. Public health is dependent on the dissemination of pertinent information. Officials need to assess the virology of circulating animal and human infections to best assess vaccination needs and other protective measures. 6 To date there has been no evidence of efficient humanto-human transmission of H5N1 virus. However, the continued circulation and now spread to Europe of the virulent H5N1 virus increases the possibility of the reassortment of this virus with other circulating human influenza A strains and increases the possibility of a global influenza pandemic. Increasing efforts to control poultry outbreaks and increased surveillance among poultry and humans needs to be of utmost priority.",

As documented in Southeast Asia over the past nine years, the avian influenza A (H5N1) virus clearly has the ability to cross between species and result in devastating illness in humans. Infected patients present with a multitude of symptoms, including head and neck symptoms. For this reason clinicians, including otolaryngologists, should be aware of the clinical features of the Influenza A (H5N1) disease in humans and the potential risk factors for infection. Prompt identification of potential H5N1 cases is essential to ensure that patients can be managed appropriately, healthcare workers are protected, and widespread outbreaks can be thwarted.
