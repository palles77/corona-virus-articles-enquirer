However, those compounds suffer from limitations such as their reduced cell penetration (the free phosphonic acid form is negatively charged at physiological pH) as well as from nephrotoxicity. This has led to extensive search for new ANPs as well as to the development of prodrug approaches [3, 4] for enhanced bioavailability and cell internalisation [5e8] . Several ANP prodrugs were marketed, such as adevofir dipivoxyl (bis-POM PMEA) [9, 10] for the treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV), tenefovir disoproxyl (bis-POC PMPA) [11] or the newly tenofovir alafenamide [12e14] for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and HBV [15, 16] .",

            "text": "Over the last decade, our group has developed a new family of ANPs based on a trans-but-2-enyl phosphonate scaffold [17] . Compounds were directly obtained as prodrugs by a highly convergent and modular approach based on the powerful olefin acyclic cross metathesis (CM) between various allylphosphonate synthons bearing biolabile groups and N1-(or N9) crotyl (or allyl) pyrimidines or purines. This approach showed a remarkable breakthrough for the synthesis of nucleoside prodrugs compared to the known linear approaches, which suffer from low yields. It is also clear from the literature that the choice of a prodrug has a direct impact on its targeting and cell release and greatly influences the overall outcome and efficiency of the parent drug [18e20]. Thus, following this synthetic pathway, we have obtained several prodrugs [21e25] including the most commonly used carbonyloxymethyl pronucleotides (pivaloyloxymethyl-or POM, isopropyloxycarbonyloxymethyl-or POC), but also the alkoxyalkyl monoester (hexadecyloxypropyl or HDP, octadecyloxyethyl or ODE) [26] . Several of these (E)-but-2-enyl ANPs prodrugs exhibited remarkable antiviral activity against DNA and RNA viruses in submicromolar concentrations. The bis-(POM)-(E)-TbutP (1) and the prodrugs 2e4 were all very active against several herpesviruses [i.e. herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV)], representing a new potential antiviral lead.",

The desired products are often isolated with poor yields (<3%) to traces as stated for the preparation of phosphonoamidate prodrug of tenofovir (TAF) [30, 31] In order to avoid these low yields, our strategy to the targeted phenyl phosphonoamidate of (E)-but-2-enyl ANPs, was to react the allyl phenylphosphonoamidate with a N1-crotylated nucleobase under acyclic cross metathesis (CM), which is quite challenging taking into account the poisoning effect of nitrogens on CM ruthenium catalysts [32] . Any attempt to obtain the desired allylic phosphonoamidates, by the shortest strategy involving the introduction of allyl group on the phosphorodichloridate 5 to give the desired monoalkenylated compound 6, failed. In our hands as, despite several conditions, only the product of dialkylation was obtained, when observed (Scheme 1). Therefore, we decided to turn our attention to the H-phosphonate chemistry. The dimethylphosphite 7 was reacted with allyl bromide under Michaelis-Becker conditions to give the dimethylallylphosphonate 8 with 78% yield. It is important to quote than this reaction was scaled-up to 50 g. After substitution of a OMe group of 8 by a chlorine in presence of oxalyl chloride, this position was then substituted by a phenolate generated in situ to give 9 (as a mixture of enantiomers) in 65% yield. Compound 9 was treated by bromotrimethylsilane in dichloromethane for 24 h at room temperature, to give the phosphonic acid monoester derivative 10 in excellent 91% yield (Scheme 2).",

LC-MS analysis of allylphosphonoamidate 11 was optimized in terms of separation and identification. The reaction with crotylthymine was followed by LC-MS in Electron Spray Ionization (ESI), in positive mode. After 20h, three compounds were observed the allylphosphonoamidate 11, ((M \u00fe H)\u00fe,360), its homodimer form ((M \u00fe H)\u00fe,690), and phosphonoamidate ANP 18 product ((M \u00fe H)\u00fe,498). Electronic extraction of ions was performed and the subsequent areas under the corresponding chromatographic peaks determined. The conversion yield was determined as the ratio of the concentration of the allylphosphonoamidate 11 transformed to its initial concentration. ",
