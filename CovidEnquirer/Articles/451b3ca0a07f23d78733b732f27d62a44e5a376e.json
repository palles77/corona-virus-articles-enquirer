Hospital-based transmission of respiratory infectious diseases of high consequence, such as influenza, can be minimised by limiting the part HCWs play as vectors or victims of disease. HCWs may continue to work with mild respiratory illness (presenteeism), which can be serious or life-threatening if transmitted to vulnerable patients, but they also may suffer serious effects from occupationally-acquired respiratory infections, leading to increased staff absenteeism, which will compromise patient care during epidemics. While policies and protocols for optimal use of PPE and other transmission-based precautions exist in the majority of healthcare facilities, HCW compliance with them is typically limited, particularly in non-outbreak situations or in the early stages before an outbreak is recognised [2, 3] . In particular, HCWs' use of protective masks when caring for patients with respiratory infections is an important and well-documented IPC measure [4] . Yet HCW use of protective masks, and PPE in general, during routine care is often suboptimal and can result in healthcare-associated acquisition of infection [5] (Table 2) .",

The appropriate use of PPE, including respiratory protection, and hand hygiene in routine care is critical to minimising pathogen transmission to staff and other patients; sub-optimal use exposes both HCWs and patients to infection.

            "text": "The continuing burden of emerging infectious diseases For many centuries, since the age of the plague and smallpox epidemics to the 20th century outbreak of HIV/ AIDS, human infectious diseases of high consequence have presented a significant global public health challenge. These pandemics have resulted in deaths and disability of millions of people across the world, as well as causing social and economic disruption. Despite improvements in communicable disease prevention and control, including effective sanitation, vector control, vaccines, and the International Health Regulations developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) [10] , the new, emerging infectious diseases continue to threaten the well-being and economic stability of society and impose a significant burden on healthcare. Although some infectious diseases, such as plague or smallpox, no longer present an active global pandemic threat, this century has seen both new and re-emerging infectious diseases give rise to widespread outbreaks. Of particular current concern is re-assortment of RNA in viruses such as influenza A which contributes to emerging pandemic influenza strains [11] . Furthermore, several zoonotic viral diseases that have infected humans through animal-to-human contact have also demonstrated human-to-human transmission, such as Nipah virus [12] . Antecedents for the increasing burden of infectious diseases include a global population boom, changes in the use of land and environment, loss of wild life habitat, increased contact between wild and domestic animals and humans, the expansion in travel, an ageing population and developments in medical interventions. The latter two have led to an increase in the number of immunecompromised people who are susceptible to significant disease from emerging infections. Many of these people attend, or are frequent inpatients of, healthcare facilities and therefore are at risk of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs).",

Seasonal vaccine efficacy varies from year to year because of variable matching between vaccine and circulating strains, but is generally less than 50e60% [22] . Even when HCW flu vaccine uptake is high the risk remains, because of vaccine mismatch with circulating strain, limited vaccine efficacy and/or mild or subclinical (but transmissible) infection in vaccinated subjects [23] .

Staff illness compromises the quality and safety of patient care by loss of continuity of care through the requirement to employ agency staff in place of regular staff, who may be unfamiliar with the specialism of the clinical setting [28] . Staff absenteeism during outbreaks of emerging or high consequence infectious diseases, may also be due to HCWs fear of acquiring the infection [29] . Similarly, presenteeism, or coming to work when ill, also results in a loss of productivity due to staff not working at full capacity [30] . The health and safety of other staff are put at risk by HCWs who continue to work while ill, while patient safety may be compromised through impaired clinical judgement. In a study undertaken in a children's hospital in Philadelphia, 299 (55%) of medical staff who were surveyed, reported that they would work with significant respiratory symptoms, despite acknowledging the infection risk to their co-workers and patients [31] . In another study over 40% of US HCWs who were surveyed worked with symptoms of influenza-like illness [32] . Whilst it is important to avoid presenteeism, it may be occasionally unavoidable e.g. because of significant or specialised staff shortages. If so, the risk may be mitigated by appropriate mask use. The HCWs work capability may also be impaired by any physical and psychological consequences of wearing a mask, such as claustrophobia, respiratory distress, discomfort and skin irritation.",

In a survey of healthcare workers in the US, 43% of doctors reported having received PPE training only as students (including clinical rotations) or not at all (c.f. 8% of nurses) [41] . Despite prior education, HCWs may not apply their knowledge to the workplace [42] . The method of training is therefore an important consideration for effective retention of knowledge and skills over time. Several studies argue for improving the evaluation and training of HCWs using PPE for infectious diseases and examining the effectiveness of various teaching approaches [43, 44] . The recent Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak instigated intensive PPE training around the world, with a focus on donning and doffing protocols to maximise HCW safety. Unsafe use of PPE has been blamed for some HCWs becoming infected with EVD or SARS; subsequently several research studies have reviewed the effectiveness of different training techniques for the safe donning and doffing of PPE [45] . These have included interactive online courses, and classroom teaching that incorporates fluorescent dye or harmless bacteriophages as surrogate markers of contamination [46] . Video-reflexive ethnography (VRE) has been used as an interventional methodology to improve IPC practices [47] . This method allows the HCW to view video footage of themselves making decisions around and subsequently using protective masks in every-day complex work. The clinicians can then reflect on their behaviour and suggest ways in which their own and colleagues' mask use can be optimised.",

During periods of high-risk for respiratory infectious disease, such as the annual influenza season or a novel influenza pandemic, health departments have, and may, encourage or mandate the use of a protective respiratory mask by the general public to minimise the transmission from symptomatic people to others [49] . In healthcare facility waiting rooms it is recommended that symptomatic patients be given a respiratory mask to wear to protect others as part of respiratory hygiene [49] . This social behaviour may alter the perception of risk for staff towards mask use in two ways, particularly in the emergency department. Firstly, HCWs may take a view that it is the patient's, not their own, responsibility to abide by these infection prevention measures and purposefully choose not to wear a mask on the basis of responsibility. Secondly, they may not perceive a risk of becoming infected if a patient is wearing a mask and so will not use one. There are several risks for HCWs adopting this behaviour. The patient may not wear the mask correctly or remove it at any time, especially if they are kept waiting for long periods, thus exposing other patients and HCWs. Additionally, the patient may not be able to tolerate a mask for long if unwell and will then remove it. Clinical examination may put the HCW at higher risk of exposure, even if the patient is wearing the mask correctly when they enter the room or cubicle and certain procedures, such as taking a swab for influenza testing, collection of an induced sputum specimen or intubation, require removal of the patient's mask.",

We argue that the value of such research would be its potential impact on the ongoing threat of emerging infectious diseases, workforce capability, capacity and educational needs, the financial costs of healthcare and outbreaks and the importance of social responsibility and appropriate legislation in planning for global security. Specifically, research is required to determine whether HCWs' perception of risk as it relates to the protection of themselves and others against transmission of infection influences their behaviour towards the use of a protective mask. There is also a need to determine the personal, professional and contextual factors that impact on HCWs' perceptions of risk and their use of protective masks for infectious diseases. An exploration of the practices and constructs of risk by HCWs will therefore provide valuable information to inform policy and pandemic planning.",

Minimising the transmission of respiratory disease through protective mask use leads to better outcomes for healthcare, workforce capability and economic stability. This paper has presented the background and justification for research into the attitudes and behaviour of HCWs towards protective mask use for respiratory infectious diseases during non-outbreak situations so as to optimise the use of masks when indicated in every day practice. The research can provide insight into perceptions of risk and risk-taking behaviour in respect of mask use for respiratory infectious diseases and help to bridge the gap between theory and practice (see Table 3 ).",
