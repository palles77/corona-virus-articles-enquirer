Methods: PubMed, Google Scholar, ISI Web of Knowledge, Scirus, and Scielo were searched (to December 2008) for reports of accidental viral infections, written in English, Portuguese, Spanish, or German; the authors' personal file of scientific articles and references from the articles retrieved in the initial search were also used. Systematic review was carried out with inclusion criteria of presence of accidental viral infection's cases information, and exclusion criteria of absence of information about the viral etiology, and at least probable mode of infection. Results: One hundred and forty-one scientific articles were obtained, 66 of which were included in the analysis. For arboviruses, 84% of the laboratory infections had aerosol as the source; for alphaviruses alone, aerosol exposure accounted for 94% of accidental infections. Of laboratory arboviral infections, 15.7% were acquired percutaneously, whereas 41.6% of hospital infections were percutaneous. For airborne viruses, 81% of the infections occurred in laboratories, with hantavirus the leading causative agent. Aerosol inhalation was implicated in 96% of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infections, 99% of hantavirus infections, and 50% of coxsackievirus infections, but infective droplet inhalation was the leading mode of infection for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and the mucocutaneous mode of infection was involved in the case of infection with influenza B. For blood-borne viruses, 92% of infections occurred in hospitals and 93% of these had percutaneous mode of infection, while among laboratory infections 77% were due to infective aerosol inhalation. Among blood-borne virus infections there were six cases of particular note: three cases of acute hepatitis following hepatitis C virus infection with a short period of incubation, one laboratory case of human immunodeficiency virus infection through aerosol inhalation, one case of hepatitis following hepatitis G virus infection, and one case of fulminant hepatitis with hepatitis B virus infection following exposure of the worker's conjunctiva to hepatitis B virus e antigen-negative patient saliva. Of the 12 infections with viruses with preferential mucocutaneous transmission, seven occurred percutaneously, aerosol was implicated as a possible source of infection in two cases, and one atypical infection with Macacine herpesvirus 1 with fatal encephalitis as the outcome occurred through a louse bite. One outbreak of norovirus infection among hospital staff had as its probable mode of infection the ingestion of inocula spread in the environment by fomites. Conclusions: The currently accepted and practiced risk analysis of accidental viral infections based on the conventional dynamics of infection of the etiological agents is insufficient to cope with accidental viral infections in laboratories and to a lesser extent in hospitals, where unconventional modes of infection are less frequently present but still have relevant clinical and potential epidemiological consequences. Unconventional modes of infection, atypical clinical development, or extremely severe cases are frequently present together with high viral loads and high virulence of the agents manipulated in laboratories. In hospitals by contrast, the only possible association of atypical cases is with the individual resistance of the worker. Current standard precaution practices are insufficient to prevent most of the unconventional infections in hospitals analyzed in this study; it is recommended that special attention be given to flaviviruses in these settings.",

After 10 days, this health care worker developed fever and splenomegaly; 1 day later he developed jaundice and diarrhea, and subsequently petechiae, melena and delirium, with facial muscle contractions. On the following day, the worker died. The clinical picture of this exceptional case is consistent with yellow fever hemorrhagic fever. 4 A case reported in 1939 concerns a laboratory infection caused by the western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) percutaneously; the woman presented fever and headache 10 days after entering the laboratory and starting work with WEEV. Five days after the first symptoms, the fever peaked (40 8C) and convulsions progressing to coma and death on the following day overcame. 5 Another exceptional case of laboratory WEEV infection was reported in 1940 and occurred as a researcher had the mucosa of the facial cavities exposed to highly concentrated chicken embryo viral inocula and aerosol released in a centrifugation accident that dispersed visible viral inocula over a considerable extent of the laboratory room surfaces. The researcher had not been using goggles or a protection mask at the time of the accident. Fourteen days after the accident, the researcher presented headache, nausea, and vomiting, and 2 days later a fever of 39.4 8C. Manifestations of irritability, spasms of superior members' muscles, delirium and lethargy resulted in his hospitalization. The fever peaked at 42.2 8C and cardiac frequency reached 140 bpm, 8 days after first symptoms death occurred due to meningoencephalitis. 6 The researcher's failure to use personal protective equipment was critical in his exposure to the inocula in the amount involved in this infection.",

The first was an infection of a researcher by chikungunya virus (CHIKV), which was originally reported in 1965. 9 In this instance a suspension of 10% infected mouse brain was used to infect mosquitoes through a nylon membrane. The researcher had had no direct contact with the viral suspension and was certified as having had no mosquito bites during the procedure, leaving only aerosol as the source of infection. Following 8 days of incubation the researcher presented with fever, muscular pain, and rash, and only lymphocytosis as a remarkable feature, being this a mild normal presentation of CHIKV infection. 9 The last case of alphavirus infection was a laboratory infection with Mayaro virus (MAYV) reported in 1999 in which the mode of infection was aerosol inhalation. This occurred during a sucrose-acetone antigen extraction procedure, followed by obtainment of solid antigen by dehydration with the use of a vacuum pump. 10 The infection with aerosol as source was demonstrated, and developed clinically following 6 days of incubation with fever and indistinct and mild clinical course, which is expected for normal MAYV infections. 10 All 16 of these accidental infections by alphaviruses took place in laboratories and were predominantly caused by infective aerosol inhalation. The severity of the WEEV infections is of note, as this virus is considered less virulent than eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) and VEEV in conventional natural infections. 70 Of the total 22 accidental infections by flaviviruses analyzed, seven occurred in hospitals, one caused by YFV and the others caused by dengue virus (DENV). Two resulted from the mucocutaneous mode of infection (exposure of the worker's conjunctiva to blood of the patient with dengue fever, and exposure of another worker's skin to a small amount of blood from a yellow fever patient). The five remaining DENV infections had percutaneous mode of infection. For the 15 laboratory cases, the modes of infection were percutaneous in five cases and aerosol inhalation in 10.",

The clinical presentation followed 6 days of incubation and included fever, sore throat, neck swelling, severe headache, and vomiting, which resulted in hospitalization. The other two cases had biphasic meningoencephalitis after 6 days of incubation, one of whom also presented ketoacidosis, coma, and conjunctival hemorrhage. 11 In the second report, two percutaneous infections and one with aerosol as source of infection were reported; the period of incubation ranged from 5 to 8 days (in the case of aerosol inhalation). In both percutaneous cases, fever, headache, and local lymphadenopathy occurred, while the aerosol case presented clinically with fever, retro-orbital pain, lack of coordination, nausea, and severe diarrhea. In this latter case viral suspensions with high viral titers were again handled, while the two percutaneous cases had worked with infected mice. 12 Five laboratory infections of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) were reported, and the source of infection was established as aerosol for four of these cases; 13-15 the remaining case was excluded from further analysis. Two of the cases had a period of incubation of 10 days, with fatal meningo-encephalitis as the outcome for one and an inapparent infection in the other. 13, 14 One of the remaining cases had aerosol inhalation as the probable mode of infection, but the report did not describe the clinical development. 13 The last case in this series occurred as a researcher processed a viral suspension of 10% infected mouse brain (high viral titer), with aerosol inhalation as the probable mode of infection.

The case due to aerosol inhalation had an incubation period of 5 days and then fever with a normal mild clinical outcome. 16, 18 The two percutaneous infection cases had incubation periods of 3 to 4 days and fever with mild respiratory symptoms in one and fever with maculopapular rash in the other, all within the normal clinical range for WNV infections. 19 The 12 accidental arboviral infections that occurred in hospitals analyzed in this study included seven as a result of the mucocutaneous mode of infection (one YFV infection, one DENV infection, and five CCHFV cases) and five by percutaneous mode caused by DENV, with the period of incubation ranging from 4 to 8 days and the development of classical dengue fever. 4,20-24 Three cases of RVFV infection occurring at a laboratory were reported in 1935. 25 The mode of infection was established as aerosol inhalation for only one of these cases. It must be pointed out that although the clinical development was of mild viral fever, the incubation period ranged from 30 to 90 days, while the normal incubation period for natural RVFV infection is up to 6 days. 25 The analyzed cases of CCHFV infection resulted from a single hospital cluster in which one patient presenting hemorrhagic fever due to infection with this virus was examined by a physician whose skin was exposed to bloody vomit during the procedure. After this mucocutaneous exposure, the physician developed fever, leukopenia, and hemorrhages consistent with hemorrhagic fever caused by this virus, and recovered 1 month later. The four remaining cases were exposed to the virus during a surgical procedure on the above mentioned patient, in which a surgeon and an assistant officer had close contact with the patient and an anesthetist and another member of the surgical team also had contact with the patient's blood. Hence the mode of infection was probably mucocutaneous, although the possibility of infective aerosol exposure from the patient's airways cannot be discounted. All four of these cases presented hemorrhagic fever, with a fatal outcome for the surgeon and the assistant officer. 24 The six reported laboratory accidental infections with Piry virus, a vesiculovirus (Rhabdoviridae family), had aerosol inhalation as the probable mode of infection. One of these cases had fever, myalgia, headache, and elevated transaminase levels. 26 Among accidental arbovirus infections, 11 cases were the result of percutaneous infection and 32 had aerosol involvement. All of those with aerosol involvement took place in laboratories in a total of 38 analyzed cases of these settings; with the respective data presented in Table 1 . 4, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] The DENV infections were an exception to the above general trend for accidental arbovirus infections, accounting for six of the hospital infections, including all the cases linked to the percutaneous mode of infection corresponding to 41.6% of the arboviral infections in these settings, as presented in Table 1 . The DENV percutaneous cases constituted 45.4% of the total percutaneous arbovirus infections analyzed in this study.",

            "text": "The series of reports of accidental infection with airborne viruses begins with two cases, one reported in 1942 and the other in 1943. Both were laboratory infections with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). In the first case, the mode of infection was arthropod vectorization, as the infection resulted from the bites of lice from a dying infected monkey; this infection developed clinically with leukopenia, paralysis, and meningoencephalitis. 27 The second case occurred upon the generation of infective aerosol due to the explosion of a celluloid tube submitted to a flame; the tube contained a suspension of 10% infected guinea pig spleen. After 17 days of incubation, this case presented clinically fever, dry cough, jaundice, leukopenia, and pneumonia. 28 One case of Machupo virus infection was attributed to infective dust inhalation. 13 Three other cases of Machupo infection occurred in a hospital cluster. Two of the cases were nurses who cared for a patient with Bolivian hemorrhagic fever during the last 3 days of disease and life, in which the mode of infection was probably mucocutaneous, though there was also the possibility of infective aerosol involvement. The clinical presentation in one of these nurses was of classical Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, with 10 days of incubation followed by jaundice, necrotizing bronchopneumonia, hemorrhages, and death on the 12th day of illness. Clinically, the other nurse developed fever and nausea after 9 days of incubation and was hospitalized 6 days after, following which hemorrhagic fever presented; the nurse recovered on the 11th day of hospitalization. The third analyzed case in this cluster was a medical examiner who cut his thumb while performing an autopsy on the first nurse at 3-h post-mortem. He immersed the thumb in formalin, changed his gloves, and resumed the autopsy. After 4 days of incubation, fever (38 8C) manifested, with subsequent jaundice requiring the hospitalization of this case. Hemorrhagic fever then manifested and he died 5 days after hospitalization, with disseminated parenchymal necrosis and lung consolidation being found on pathological analysis. 29 Another accidental infection case occurred through aerosol inhalation during initial works on the characterization of Sabia virus. This case presented with a 3-4-week period of incubation (a long period of incubation for a New World arenavirus) and a nonlethal hemorrhagic fever. 30 A second laboratory infection with Sabia virus and aerosol inhalation as the mode of infection occurred in a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facility. Despite that, the researcher only wore a disposable gown, two pairs of gloves, and a surgical mask (droplet protection only), which constitute BSL2 personal protective equipment. The researcher had no positive pressure high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtered respirator, and after performing a centrifugation of 200 ml of viral suspension in a bottle with Vero cell culture (high titer viral suspension with high volume), viral suspension was found in the bottom of the rotor and the outside of the bottle was wet when the lid of the rotor was opened by the virologist. After 8 days of incubation the researcher presented myalgia, neck stiffness, fever, and headache. On hospitalization, fever (37.6 8C), tachycardia (96 bpm), hematocrit of 42%, leukopenia, platelet count of 138 \u00c2 10 9 /l, and moderate proteinuria were present, and intravenous ribavirin was administered for 9 days. On the second day of hospitalization the white blood cell count reached a nadir of 1.3 \u00c2 10 9 /l and the platelet count was 98 \u00c2 10 9 /l. No hemorrhages presented and the patient made a complete recovery after 10 days in hospital. 31 Twenty-one LCMV infections with aerosol inhalation as the mode of infection occurred in a hospital; strikingly half of the cases developed only fever and myalgia, an extremely mild presentation for LCMV infections. 32 The accidental infections with hantavirus in laboratories included 149 cases, of which 147 had infective aerosol inhalation as mode of infection. One hundred and twenty-six of the total hantavirus cases were infected with the B1 strain of Puumala virus (PUUV), of which two cases are of particular note: a case with percutaneous mode of infection due to an infected rat bite and a case of conventional percutaneous mode of infection, both of whom had hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). 33 Of the 14 cases of SARS, 13 occurred in hospitals with droplet inhalation as the mode of infection and an incubation period ranging from 2 to 7 days, followed by the development of typical pneumonia. 34 The remaining case occurred in a laboratory, had aerosol inhalation as the mode of infection, and had an atypical clinical development with only fever and minor upper respiratory symptoms. 35 The absence of droplet precautions, namely the use of surgical masks as primary personal protective equipment, was a critical factor in the SARS-CoV hospital infections.",

Among the 152 hospital cases analyzed, 142 involved the percutaneous mode of infection non-exclusively and 12 involved the mucocutaneous mode of infection non-exclusively (two of which involved inocula contact with the conjunctiva 41, 42 ). Of these 152 cases, 51 were caused by HCV, 91 by HIV (one of which was of simultaneous HIV and HCV infection), eight by parvovirus B19, two by hepatitis B virus (HBV; one of which was of simultaneous HBV and hepatitis D virus (HDV/ delta virus) infection), and one by hepatitis G virus (HGV). [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] One case of HIV infection that occurred in a laboratory before 1988 is of great relevance, as the researcher suffered an infection with an in vitro culture-adapted strain of HIV-1 while working in BSL3 conditions carrying out viral stock production procedures. This infection was associated with repeated viral suspension spills inside the centrifuge and in the work area. 46 Another noteworthy case was a fulminant hepatitis B case whose mode of infection was mucocutaneous due to contact of the nurse's conjunctiva with a hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative HBV carrier patient's saliva. Such a case exemplifies an infection with exceptional severity given the low risk exposure involved once HBeAg is the main marker for the source patient's infectivity; 42 such an infection argues for the case of the relevance of susceptibility of the inoculated person. Another exceptional case was an accidental simultaneous infection with HCV and HIV by percutaneous mode of infection. 43 For the HCV the period of incubation was 44 days and was followed by mild acute hepatitis. 43 Three other HCV infection cases were remarkable due to the exceptionally short incubation periods following percutaneous infection. One of them had a period of incubation 50 while the normal period of incubation for HCV is approximately 2 months; 49 these cases developed acute hepatitis. Table 3 40-57 shows the clear predominance of the percutaneous mode of infection for HIV and HCV, but not for parvovirus B19 infections. The low number of HBV and HGV infections limits comparisons by their modes of infection ( Table 3) .",

In the second case, a small skin injury came into contact with infected monkey saliva, resulting initially in a local herpetic lesion and then in a clinical outcome similar to the first case, with respiratory arrest and death within a few days. 58 One additional infection with herpes B (McHV1) occurred by mucocutaneous mode of infection in a research laboratory setting. This case was exposed to unidentified secretions of an infected macaque in the eye. Ten days after this exposure the affected eye was swollen and red but without dendritic lesions, and 5 days later the worker presented fever (38.5 8C) and conjunctivitis and was hospitalized. Cerebrospinal fluid examination showed the presence of 8 lymphocytes/ml, and acyclovir (15 mg/kg) was administered from 2 h after hospitalization. The worker was discharged after 11 days on intravenous ganciclovir outpatient therapy; 1 day later the worker suffered ascending myelitis and subsequently flaccid paralysis. After the presentation of seizures, the clinical picture of postviral acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis was considered and this patient was then treated with foscarnet. Over the course of 9 days the patient developed nosocomial bacterial pneumonia, and died 33 days after the beginning of symptoms from refractory respiratory failure. 59 A hospital infection with MARV occurred in a nurse following the repeated handling without gloves of wet facial tissues belonging to the companion of a patient with Marburg hemorrhagic fever. The patient with Marburg hemorrhagic fever died and then the companion manifested the same disease, hence this infection probably occurred through the mucocutaneous mode of infection. The nurse developed retro-orbital pain, myalgia, and fever (37.5-38.5 8C) and was hospitalized; 2 days later a low platelet count of 49 \u00c2 10 9 /l and diarrhea presented. On day 5 of hospitalization a maculopapular rash was present on the arm and 2 months later the nurse developed uveitis, after which a full recovery was made. During the hospitalization period MARV was isolated from a sample of the liquid from the anterior ocular chamber. 60 The lack of contact precautions and use of barrier personal protective equipment were critical factors in this infection, as is commonly found in African hemorrhagic fever virus infections in health care workers. Three cases of vaccinia virus (VACV) infection in laboratory settings stand out: the first case occurred as a result of percutaneous infection by two recombinant strains, one containing the G gene and the second the 22-k gene, both from respiratory syncytial virus; this case developed more severely, with an incubation period of 3 days, followed by local tumor, rash, erythematous papules, and severe lymphadenopathy. 61 The second case happened with direct contact between the skin and the inoculum. The agent was a recombinant strain containing the cytohesin 1 gene whose product inhibits the biochemical cascade triggered by the binding of lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA-1) to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), therefore inhibiting inflammatory cell migration. Clinically, this case presented a local hemorrhagic necrosis in one exposed finger and a papule on the other exposed finger. 62 The third case of VACV infection occurred as a student processed a viral suspension of 10 10 PFU/ml (high titer), and the most likely mode of infection identified in this report was mucocutaneous, with viral particles carried by the hands to the eyes; alternatively there was the possibility that the eyes were exposed to infective aerosol. The clinical result of the infection was classical purulent ocular vaccinia. 63 The likelihood of inoculum carried by hands to the eyes constitutes a clear breach of adequate laboratory procedures and demonstrates the absence of use of personal protective equipment (goggles) as a factor in the occurrence of the infection.",

Only two infections resulted from the percutaneous mode of infection: one herpes B 58 (currently named McHV1) 71 infection due to an infected monkey bite and one possible self inoculation of WEEV with a syringe. 5 For the second 24-year period, 68 cases were studied, of which 31 occurred in hospitals (21 with involvement of infective aerosols, three percutaneous, and seven mucocutaneous) and 37 occurred in laboratories (31 with involvement of infective aerosols and four through the percutaneous mode of infection, one of which was a possible percutaneous mode combined with infective aerosol inhalation). Within this period, six cases were caused by LIV (three through percutaneous mode of infection, one through aerosol inhalation, and the remaining cases through an unidentified mode of infection 11, 12 ), three were caused by KFDV due to infective aerosol inhalation in laboratory settings, 17 five were caused by CCHFV in a hospital with probable mucocutaneous mode of infection, 24 three were caused by Machupo in a hospital, 29 21 were caused by LCMV (all in a hospital through aerosol inhalation), 32 25 by Hantaan hantavirus (HTNV) with aerosol inhalation as mode of infection, 36, 37 one by TBEV with aerosol as source, 13, 16 one by SLEV with aerosol as source, 13 one by Machupo virus in a laboratory, 13 and two by Lassa virus (one possibly through percutaneous mode of infection and one with mucocutaneous and possible aerosol inhalation as the mode of infection). 65, 66 The final 24 years comprised reports of 367 analyzed cases, of which 157 occurred in laboratories and 210 in hospitals. Of the cases in the laboratory setting, 145 involved infective aerosols, and 124 of these were caused by PUUV hantavirus, 33 one by SARS-CoV, 35 nine by parvovirus B19, 40 one by MAYV, 10 two by Sabia virus, 30,31 one by TBEV, 15 six by Piry, 26 and one by HIV-1. 43 The laboratory cases in this period are reported in 13 references.

In comparison, inhalation of infective droplets was involved in 13 SARS cases, accounting for 5.4% of the cases in hospitals, and a cluster of norovirus infections in a Swiss hospital 69 through oral mode of infection accounted for 15% of the analyzed cases in the hospital setting.

The number of analyzed cases has consistently grown through these periods, the first period did not include any hospital cases, and there were more references and cases in the last period than in the first two put together, due mainly to hospital case reports. These data support the idea of a decreasing subnotification over time, and there are two reasons for these results: the first two periods correspond to the time of discovery and early characterization of many of the analyzed viruses, whereas the last period is marked by the development of the biosafety concept, resulting in a greater number of notifications. Moreover, the volume of virological research and the number of patients with viral diseases in hospitals have both grown over time. There is a uniformity in the laboratory viral infections profile respective to the mode of infection over time; remarkably only two of the percutaneous infections in laboratories were reported in the first period. There are two complementary conclusions that can be derived from these data: (1) there is no sub-notification bias specific to specific modes of infection over time, which was unexpected, and (2) the measures and protocols of biosafety generated to minimize the number of these accidental infections involving specific modes of infection were less effective than commonly supposed. In addition the majority of percutaneous infections in the hospital setting during the last period occurred with syringes after completion of the necessary procedure in the patient and even during needle recapping, demonstrating clear suboptimal implementation of the universal precautions, contact precautions, body fluid isolation, and standard practices of infection control.",

Another evident risk factor is the virus being handled, not only this study demonstrates that Piry, WEEV, TBEV, and alphaviruses in general are peculiar with respect to the risk of productive infection upon inoculation through aerosol inhalation, as the clinical severity of an infection by non-conventional mode of infection is clearly virus-orientated as displayed in WEEV, TBEV, McHV1 infections, with a smaller contribution of host resistance for the clinical presentation and outcome.",

However such results are likely the product of a sub-notification bias, as blood-borne viruses are the most frequently diagnosed hospital infections and these are the leading etiologies for infections by this mode of infection. No consistent correlation analysis could be pursued for the probability of infection or its severity and the deepness of the exposure with regard to the modes of infection analyzed. Even a comparison for the percutaneous and mucocutaneous modes of infection was not feasible due to the lack of data with respect to the deepness of exposure variable in a significant portion of the reports; this limitation hampered such a comparison even for those cases with the percutaneous mode of infection. Similarly comparison between the inocula in different cases for different modes of infection was not feasible due to the limitations in the data with regard to the quantity of infective aerosol and droplets. Even the data on inocula in percutaneous infections are limited. The best approach for the issue is to use the clinical state of the source patient as a parameter for the inocula. Such an approach gave positive associations in the case of simultaneous HIV and HCV accidental infection, 43 in the case of Lassa hemorrhagic fever, 16, 66 and in a case of dengue fever caused by mucocutaneous exposure for which the source patient presented secondary DENV infection with hepatitis and signs indicative of dengue hemorrhagic fever. 23 However the case of fulminant hepatitis by HBV 42 and the lack of data even in percutaneous case reports supporting this notion decrease support for this idea. The atypical or exceptionally severe infections in hospitals do not correlate with the mode of infection or the viral agent involved, and neither a greater deepness of exposure nor higher inocula were reported for these infections. Therefore, although the potential contribution of these factors cannot be ignored, the relevance of the individual host resistance as a factor for the occurrence of such cases is well supported in the hospital setting, whereas the relevance of this factor in such processes is lower in laboratory settings, as supported by the results and analyses presented herein.",

The use of a mask and goggles is also recommended whenever dealing with a feverish patient or whenever there is any reason to suspect a viral infection, particularly a blood-borne viral infection. N95 masks are highly recommended when treating patients with severe respiratory signs or in cases of hemorrhagic fever, and isolation is recommended in these cases, especially the latter. Definitive laboratory diagnosis and identification of the etiology should be sought when dealing with viral infections, especially the acute and potentially lethal ones. Of the eight analyzed cases whose mode of infection was completely unexpected (five percutaneous, one mucocutaneous by DENV, and one mucocutaneous by YFV) and whose clinical development was exceptionally fast and severe (fulminant hepatitis by HBV with mucocutaneous infection), two of the dengue cases (the mucocutaneous infection and one percutaneous due to deep puncture) would have been avoided by the strict adoption of standard precautions and three cases would have been avoided if not only the standard precaution protocols but also precautionary principle awareness had been in effect. This basic principle of biosafety is here interpreted as follows: total control of all the variables of a complex system is not possible at any given time, therefore the adoption of risk minimization and contingency measures against damages are needed, with reasonable criteria, even when the specific risks under evaluation are considered insignificant a priori.",
