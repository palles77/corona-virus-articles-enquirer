            "text": "In the United States, most major pharmaceutical companies are actively acquiring terrestrial and marine natural products, extracts from terrestrial and marine macroorganisms and microorganisms, and /or cultures of terrestrial and marine microorganisms for the purpose of finding new, small molecule lead structures. To our knowledge, many of the major pharmaceutical companies in Japan and Europe are involved as well. The U.S. government has provided substantial support since the 1970s for academic research on biologically active marine-derived compounds; government agencies include the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Institute of Allergic and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), as well as the National Sea Grant College Program/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (Persinos 1989\u00a3, 1990c (Persinos 1989\u00a3, , 1991c . Increased interest by the U.S. government in biologically active marine and terrestrial natural products has recently led, for example, to the formation by NIH of National Cooperative Natural Product Drug Discovery Groups, which include most of the prominent academic labs engaged in marine and terrestrial natural products research, several of the major pharmaceutical companies, and representatives from NIH for the purpose of discovering new structural leads with activity against cancers, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and opportunistic infections associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (Persinos 1990b (Persinos , 1990c . Strong programs in natural products research have historically existed in Europe and Japan. The tremendous level of interest by Japan in the development of marine resources has recently led their government, industry, and universities to undertake major, long term initiatives in \"marine biotechnology,\" which include efforts to produce marinederived pharmaceuticals (Persinos 1989c (Persinos , 1990a . In fact, two major facilities were recently built expressly for this purpose, one in the city of Kamaishi, to take advantage of organisms found in the cold currents off Japan's northeast coast, and the other in the city of Shimizu, where the currents are warm.",

Throughout the 5000 years of recorded history of medicines, which includes records from China (Kim 1967) , the Middle East, South America, Europe, and Mexico, until the 1800s, the primary source of medicines consisted of terrestrial plants (in the form of herb preparations; \"Galenic\" medicine) (Burger 1986 ). Indeed, the development of modern therapeutics is reported to have begun with digitalis, a mixture of steroid (cardiac) glycosides from several plants, including purple foxglove, Digitalis purpurea, which was used in 1785 by a British physician to treat \"dropsy,\" a condition caused by congestive heart failure and characterized by an accumulation of fluid (Burger 1986 ). Since the 1800s, numerous naturally occurring compounds have been purified and used for medicinal and health purposes, including plant metabolites, steroid hormones (androgens, estrogens, progestins), glucocorticoids (cortisone), pituitary hormones (antidiuretic hormone (ADH), adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), vasopressin, oxytocin), and vitamins (vitamin D, cod liver oil) (Physicians Desk Reference 1991; Scrip 1991; Guyton 1991) .",

            "text": "With the recognition of the microbial basis for infectious diseases in the latter half of the 1800s and the discovery of the \"lysis factor\" (penicillin) from Penicilliwn notatum in 1928, the stage was eventually set in the 1940s for the use of microorganism-derived natural products as medicines, initially as antibiotics (see discussion in Reuben and Wittcoff 1989) . Shortly after the publication of studies on penicillin, an intense search ensued to find new and better microorganism-derived antibiotics (Burger 1986) . Near a sewage outfall in the Mediterranean, an antibiotic-producing fungi, Cephalosporium acremonium, was isolated (Abraham 1962; Abraham and Newton 1967) . The biologically active components were named the cephalosporins, which are structurally related to the penicillins (Reuben and Wittcoff 1989; Caprile 1988) , and some would claim are marine-derived (Rinehart 1988a; Torres 1988) . The cephalosporins turned out to be significantly more active than the penicillins against Gramnegative microorganisms and are resistant to degradation by staphylococcal \u00dflactamase (Caprile 1988) . The cephalosporins are broadly used therapeutically as well as prophylactically (prior to surgery) (Kaiser 1988 ). Since 1964, which is when the first member of three generations of cephalosporins was introduced, over 20 cephalosporins have been marketed (Caprile 1988) . Numerous additional microorganism-derived compounds are used or are being developed not only as antibiotics, but in most major disease areas (Scrip 1991; Hall 1989) . Notable examples are the immunosuppressive agents, cyclosporin (Dreyfuss et al. 1976) and FK506 (Kino et al. 1987a (Kino et al. , 1987b , numerous antitumor antibiotics including bleomycin, calicheamicin, esperamicin, mitomycin C, CC-1065, and actinomycin D (Williams et al. 1989 and references therein), and the cholesterol-lowering agent, mevinolin (Alberts et al. 1980) .",

The world's oceans cover more than 70% of the earth's surface (Barnes 1980) and contain well over 200,000 invertebrate and algal species (George and George 1979; Winston 1988 ). There exist nearly 150,000 species (Winston 1988) of algae (seaweed), green (Chlorophyta), red (Rhodophyta), and brown (Phaeophyta), and some groups of marine invertebrates in which new chemical structures or biological activities have been reported: sponges (Porifera), cnidarians or coelenterates (corals, octocorals (including sea fans), hydroids, and sea anemones), nemerteans (worms), bryozoans, ascidians (tunicates including sea squirts), molluscs (sea snails and sea slugs), and echinoderms (brittlestars, sea urchins, starfish, and sea cucumbers). All but two of the 28 major animal phyla are represented in aquatic environments; eight phyla, including the Cnidaria, Porifera, Bryozoa, and Echinodermata, are exclusively aquatic, and primarily marine (Barnes 1980 ). 2. In terms of known species and habitats, and excluding insects, the world's oceans represent our greatest resource of new natural products (Munro et al. 1987) . Indeed, since about 1975, approximately 4000 new marine natural products have been reported from a relatively small number of research labs (Faulkner 1984a (Faulkner , 1984b (Faulkner , 1986 (Faulkner ,1987 (Faulkner ,1988 (Faulkner ,1990 (Faulkner ,1991 . Unfortunately, only a small percentage of these compounds has been fully evaluated for biological activity relevant to humans and only a few have been evaluated in clinically relevant assays. A clinically relevant assay is loosely defined as one in which a positive (potent) response would elicit very serious interest by a (pharmaceutical) company or organization that has sufficient resources and experience to successfully develop a therapeutic agent. 3. Most nonmoving (sessile) marine invertebrates (e.g., Figure 5 -1: Porifera-Demospongia, sponges; Coelenterata, sea fans, soft corals, hard corals), and algae ( Figure 5 -1: Rhodophyta, red algae; Phaeophyta, brown algae; and Chlorophyta, green algae) contain a primitive immune system, as do plants and microorganisms found in the terrestrial biosphere (vide supra). It has been hypothesized (Hall 1989; Williams et al. 1989 ) that some terrestrial, and, by analogy, some marine organisms that do not contain sophisticated immune systems use natural products, or allelochemicals (Whittaker and Feeny 1971) , in response to a variety of ecological, behavioral, and physiological factors (Bakus et al. 1986; Davis et al. 1989; Geiselman and McConnell 1981; McConnell et al. 1982; Hay and Fenical 1988; Hay et al. 1987; Paul 1988; . In order to survive and proliferate in their environments, these primitive organisms must produce compounds that are used to chemically defend themselves and/or to assist in the prevention of overgrowth or fouling. These metabolites also have therapeutic potential against human diseases because of very specific interaction with receptors and enzymes (Hall 1989; Williams et al. 1989 ). The rationale for this specificity of biological activity is that specialized vertebrate cells such as those of the humoral, nervous, immune, and vascular systems, appeared relatively recently in evolution, while the transmitter molecules they use, such as hormones, neuropeptides, and biological response modifiers as well as allelochemicals, may have arisen much earlier in unicellular or simple multicellular organisms (Gilbert 1977; Nisbet and Porter 1989; Roth et al. 1986 ). Indeed, it is believed that algae and bacteria have existed up to possibly 3.5 billion years ago, and relatively Rhodophyta IsgHHUM FIGURE 5-1 The phylogenetic tree.

An intensive and systematic collection of marine organisms for compounds with therapeutic potential was hampered in the past by the general lack of (1) familiarity chemists engaged in this research had with the marine environment, (2) lack of documented ethno-natural history of marine organisms for medicinal purposes (Scheuer 1988) , (3) appropriate collection tools, techniques, and protocols, and (4) access to clinically relevant assays by those who study marine-derived compounds. These problems have largely been overcome. Three developments that greatly aided the systematic collection of marine organisms for compounds with therapeutic potential include the advent of scuba about 40 years ago, the development of deep water collection tools over the past 20 years (for example, at Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution, HBOI), and, probably most importantly, a much closer collaboration among scientists in a variety of disciplines, i.e., marine biologists, ecologists, chemical ecologists, cell biologists, biochemists, pharmacologists, and natural products chemists.",

Using mixtures of nitrogen and oxygen (nitrox) or helium and oxygen instead of air allows scuba collections of extended duration and depth (Miller 1979) . For example, helium and oxygen mixtures may allow dives to 800 feet (-244 m) or greater, and nitrox mixtures (32% oxygen/68% nitrogen) may double bottom time at depths of 50 to 120 feet (15 to 36.5 m).

There are several disadvantages to these approaches: it is difficult to photograph the organisms in their habitat; encrusting organisms or organisms that grow in crevices, under ledges or on steep rock faces cannot be easily collected unless the hard substrate that supports the organism is collected as well; dredging and trawling put all collected samples in close contact with each other, therefore, some organisms may chemically contaminate others because of exudations or secretions of various compounds; and the environmental impact of dredging or trawling can be detrimental because the sampling is nonselective and habitats can be damaged or destroyed.",

The cost of this form of collection is obviously much higher than dredging or trawling (approximately double or triple); however, the environmental impact of this form of collection is negligible. ROVs are used extensively by the oil industry for survey and repair of oil platforms, and by marine biologists, geologists, and archeologists for survey of marine biota, geologic formations, or artifacts, respectively; however, the technology has not progressed sufficiently to render the ROVs cost effective in marine sample collection (S. Pomponi, personal communication) . In contrast, manned submersibles, as exemplified by those at HBOI, which is located on the southeast coast of Florida, have performed very well in the selective and pin-point collection (and recollection) of deep water marine samples for pharmacological evaluation. The HBOI-Johnson-Sea-Link submersibles, for example, can accommodate up to a total of four passengers, and operate at depths of 3000 feet (915 m); they have an array of collection devices and associated sample storage containers to facilitate collection of organisms displaying a wide range of shapes and sizes, and they have various video and 35 mm cameras for purposes of documentation. Using the manned submersibles, the research group in the Division of Biomedical Marine Research (DBMR) at HBOI, for example, has collected samples at 100 to 3000 feet (30 to 915 m) from the Galapagos Islands, various locations in the Caribbean, Bahamas, Gulf of Mexico, and in the eastern Atlantic at the Canary and Madiera islands.",

For the first several years of the research effort, beginning in 1984, the strategy was to collect representatives of as many shallow and deep water benthic organisms as could be found. As the research program evolved, the effort began to focus more on shallow and deep water sponges, due to their high incidence of biological activity in a variety of mechanism-based and whole cell assays and high abundance (especially as compared with such organisms as tunicates, some bryozoans, and hydroids). Because of the specialized tools available for collecting of deep water samples, an important niche of this sample collection effort has been deep water sponges. Out of approximately 150 described species from deep water environments in the West Indian biogeographic region (Van Soest and Stentoft 1988) , the DBMR/HBOI collection contains nearly all these; further, the collection contains at least another 20 to 40 new, undescribed species of deep water sponges. For comparison, the total number of described shallow and deep water species from the West Indian biogeographic region is approximately 600 (Pulitzer-Finali 1986) .",

The number of discrete samples (with unique taxonomy) is probably less than one-third, and is an estimate based on the taxonomic identification to the genera level on less than one-quarter of the samples.

Several general and several selective media are usually used for primary isolation cultures. For example, general media may include Zobell's marine agar (Zobell 1941) or peptone-yeast extract-seawater (Weyland 1969); actinomycete-selective media may include starch-yeast, extract-seawater, chitin-seawater, or glycerol-arginine agar-seawater with trace metals and vitamins added (Nonomura and Ohara 1969) as well as cycloheximide to inhibit fungal growth. Agar cultures can be incubated at different temperatures.

Symbiotic microorganisms have been repeatedly suggested as being the direct or indirect sources of bioactive metabolites in marine sponges (Frincke and Faulkner 1982; McCaffrey and Endean 1985) and other invertebrates, i.e., tunicates (Wright et al. 1990 ) and bryozoans (Fenical 1991) . Symbiotic microorganisms, in the broadest working definition of the term, may be mutualistic or parasitic with the associated host animal and the symbiosis may be obligatory or facultative (Isenberg and Balows 1981) . Actinomycetes are ubiquitous in the marine environment (Goodfellow and Haynes 1984; Weyland 1969) , and marine invertebrates contain diverse communities of microorganisms (Bergquist 1978; Colwell 1991) , including actinomycetes (E. Armstrong, personal communication) and cyanobacteria (Wilkinson 1980) . Only several specific examples exist, however, in which secondary metabolites initially extracted and identified from macroorganisms, i.e., sponges, could be produced by fermentation of specific microorganism strains isolated from the respective macroorganism (Stierle et al. 1988; Elyakov et al. 1991) . A noteworthy case in regard to marine vertebrates is that of the fish-derived N-3 fatty acids, which seem to have great value for preventing cardiovascular disease (Leaf 1985) ; they may indeed be produced by associated marine microorganisms (Kitagawa et al. 1989 ).",

Analysis of these reviews indicates that a substantial amount of research has been conducted by chemists in Europe, especially Italy, and in Australia, New Zealand, Israel, Japan, and North America. The greatest number of marine-derived compounds have been isolated from shallow water organisms and their structures published by North American and Japanese researchers, who are located at academic institutions. To our knowledge, a greater number of academic and industrial research groups have become involved in the past several years in the search for biologically active and novel compounds from marine-derived microorganisms, and we expect that this increased effort will be reflected in both the scientific and patent literature in the next several years. Collection sites for the organisms that contain these compounds span the globe and include the Caribbean, Indo-Pacific, Mediterranean, Red Sea, and the Antarctic. Relatively few deep water marine organisms have been investigated, although they appear to be fertile grounds for biologically active compounds. Most shallow and deep water macroorganisms have been collected in tropical and subtropical latitudes, presumably because of milder conditions for sample collection, and because of the greater biodiversity of available organisms (Ricklefs 1973) . These factors certainly facilitate the collection of a greater number of different organisms per collecting effort, though sample collection in higher latitudes has also been productive.",

During this time period, most marine natural products were derived from algae > sponges > cnidaria > echinoderms > tunicates > bryozoans > microbes. In part, this trend is related to the relative abundance of the respective organisms; i.e., tunicates, bryozoans, and hydroids are prolific producers of structurally unusual and biologically active natural products. However, these animals are not as abundant as algae, sponges, cnidarians, and echinoderms. With respect to their biosynthetic capabilities of secondary metabolites, algae, sponges, and cnidaria produce a greater proportion of terpenoids than any other compound type; in all three groups of organisms, the second most abundant biosynthetic class of compounds is polyketides. From our own analysis of the compounds reported since 1985, the phyletic distribution of marine natural products is approximately the same. However, the total number of compounds reported from sponges is now about the same as those reported in algae, and there have been significant increases in the number of compounds reported from tunicates and marine-derived microorganisms.",

Although many of these compounds were isolated based on the antibacterial, cytotoxic, and/or anti-inflammatory activities of the respective extracts, many were isolated based on purely chemical, chemotaxonomic, or chemical ecological interests and also screened by R. Jacobs (Jacobs et al. 1985) . The anti-inflammatory properties of manoalide (see Section 5.5.3), for example, were discovered through an essentially chemically driven process. In contrast, the anti-inflammatory properties of the pseudopterosins (Section 5.5.4) and the fuscosides (Section 5.4.3) were discovered from a more activity-directed effort. The chemically driven approach has also served other valid scientific purposes, i.e., the structural information can be used to help solve taxonomic problems associated with a variety of marine organisms (Bergquist and Wells 1983; Fenical and Norris 1975; Lawson et al. 1984; Liaaen-Jensen et al. 1982; Pomponi et al. 1991) .",

Arguments against using mechanism-of-action screens as primary screens are that serendipity and pharmacology are lacking, and useful activities may be missed (Suffness et al. 1989 ). The arguments for whole-cell systems are that general pharmacokinetic problems are addressed; if a compound can't cross a membrane, it will test negative; also, if metabolic activation is required for activity, then it has a chance of occurring in whole-cell systems.

Unfortunately, they were not very successful in finding compounds active against slow growing tumors in humans. Further, these in vivo assays were expensive, time consuming, and relatively insensitive (Suffness et al. 1989) . Our experience at HBOI in other disease areas has shown that activity in in vitro antiviral assays does not translate well to in vivo activity, e.g., using Herpes simplex. In contrast, reasonable correlations exist between in vitro and in vivo antifungal activity, e.g., using Candida albicans, and between in vitro and in vivo immune suppressive activity, e.g., using the MLR as the in vitro assay and the graft-versus-host reaction (GVHR) or splenomegaly model as the follow up in vivo assay.",

In our experience, this combined approach has meant selecting extracts for chemical fractionation based on the biological activity profile of the crude extract. However, instead of using a bioassay-guided approach to purify the compounds responsible for the activity of the extract, NMR and TLC are used to isolate the chemically most interesting substances. Ideally, the structurally unusual or novel compounds are also responsible for the activity of the extract. This approach works well when the active compounds are present in high concentration and the assay turnaround time is longer than a couple of weeks. If the concentration is low, as was the case for the ecteinascidins (Wright et al. 1990 ), structurally complex isoquinoline alkaloids found at a level of 1 mg compound/1 kg of the tunicate, Ecteinascidia turbinata, the active compounds would have been overlooked completely, had a purely chemical approach been employed.

Because the optimum collection strategy is to collect samples in as many different locales and habitats as possible, the charted course for a collecting trip generally does not involve retracing parts of the route; therefore, it is not practical to count on recollecting larger amounts of a particular organism whose extract has exhibited activity. Further, some assays take several days, and waiting at one collecting site or in the vicinity until assay results are evaluated is a waste of collecting resources. 3. A valid strategy to optimize finding new marine-derived compounds with therapeutic potential is to have the respective extracts evaluated in as many clinically relevant assays as possible and making collection decisions on a few simple (usually unsophisticated), rugged on-site assays imposes an unnecessary constraint. 4. Worrying about sample degradation after taking reasonable precautions, e.g., freezing samples or storing them in solvent before biological evaluation, also imposes unnecessary constraints. In our experience, biological activity in most frozen samples remains intact for up to 9 years; it is simply not worth the effort to concern oneself with a minority of samples that are somewhat labile.",

If novel compounds are sought (chemically driven approach) (which may subsequently be evaluated for biological activity), NMR, TLC, HPLC, and/or liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) can be used to \"screen\" extracts, and taxonomic identification of the respective organism can be used as well to dereplicate. If biologically active compounds are sought (biologically driven approach), mechanism-based, functional whole cell, tissue-based or in vivo assays are used to screen extracts and guide chemical fractionation. In regard to marine natural products, the biologically driven approach is very appropriate because many compounds whose structures have been published have not been thoroughly evaluated for biological activity. Further, as is well appreciated, a new assay redefines an otherwise exhausted compound and extract library into a whole new sample set. The particulars of a biologically driven approach are critical, however, if marine-derived compounds are sought with therapeutic potential. Indeed, discriminating and predictive assays are required to find compounds that will be used therapeutically not within the next year but rather in 5, 10, or 15 years from now! To optimize a biologically driven approach, interorganizational collaboration between groups that have expertise in chemistry, biology, research, and development is important, in our view; few academic, government, or industrial research groups truly have the resources, expertise, and interest to be completely autonomous in taking a compound from the ocean to the market. Academic and government research groups typically have some expertise or ready access to expertise in marine biology and ecology, sample collection or procurement, sometimes fermentation, isolation, and structure elucidation or synthesis (usually not both), and biological evaluation in a limited number of disease areas. Many industrial concerns usually have expertise in isolation, structure elucidation, synthesis, biological evaluation, process chemistry, fermentation, preclinical and clinical development, patenting, and marketing. Pharmaceutical companies, however, view natural products as one source in their drug discovery programs, and, therefore, their resources are spread between natural products screening and chemical synthesis.",

            "text": "From our experience, the best relationship to strive for between academic and industrial programs is a scientific collaboration, i.e., one in which extensive exchange of technical information takes place. From an academic point of view, the needs are usually modest, i.e., scientific gratification and monetary support for research. From an industrial point of view, the samples obtained and information exchanged through such a collaboration must ultimately have a commercial benefit (in order to stay in business). Further, a related industrial concern is confidentiality, which, unfortunately, is not the best fit with the academic goal of publishing (or perishing!). A distinct advantage of working with a pharmaceutical company is the possibility that if a marine-derived compound expresses a suitable profile from the company's point of view, resources and expertise to conduct structure-activity optimization studies may become available to study the compound, and to supply sufficient quantities of optimized compound through fermentation or synthesis for preclinical and clinical studies. Typically, academic groups are simply not in a position to accomplish these tasks by themselves; if the goal of a marinederived drug is to become a reality, some sort of appropriate partnership between an academic group and an interested development partner is necessary and inevitable.",

However, because of the limited supplies of mammalian prostaglandins from sheep seminal tissues at the time, there was great interest in P. homomalla as a potential commercial-scale source of synthetic precursors (Weinheimer and Spraggins 1969; Corey and Matsuda 1987) . Further, it was determined that P. homomalla grew well at shallow depths in the Caribbean on artificial substrates (Corey and Matsuda 1987) . Subsequently, the industrial process chemistry to synthesize active prostaglandins improved such that interest waned in harvesting P. homomalla from the ocean. From a scientific viewpoint, P. homomalla continues to generate interest because the prostaglandins found in this animal and a soft coral, i.e., the clavulones (e.g., clavulone I; (5.2A)) found in Clavularia viridis (Kikuchi et al. 1982), are not produced by the mammalian cyclooxygenase/endoperoxide route (Corey et al. 1975) ; rather, they appear to be produced from arachidonic acid by Hpoxygenation at C-8, and subsequent transformation into an allene oxide, followed by oxidopentadienyl cation intermediates. These intermediates readily account for the observed 5,6-cis-and 5,6-irans-prostanoids as well as a cyclopropyl compound that are produced when arachidonic acid is incubated with an acetone powder of P. homomalla (Corey and Matsuda 1987; Baertshi et al. 1989 ).",

Kishi and his research group (Armstrong et al. 1989a (Armstrong et al. , 1989b and references therein), must be considered quintessential scientific achievements. Paly toxin, a large polyoxygenated metabolite (molecular weight, 2681) obtained from the zoanthid Palythoa toxica and other Palythoa species, posed an extreme challenge; the structure elucidation was achieved by oxidatively degrading the molecule and elucidating the degradation products, which by themselves are larger than many natural products. From a biological activity viewpoint, it is especially noteworthy because it is the most potent nonproteinaceous toxin known, having a minimum lethal dose in guinea pigs of 0.15 \u03bcg/kg (Haddad et al. 1983 ). (By comparison, the most potent proteinaceous toxin, botulinus toxin A, has a minimum lethal dose of 0.00003 \u03bcg/kg.) In the two-stage mouse skin promotion assay, paly toxin is also a potent tumor promoter, although it fails to induce ornithine decarboxylase in mouse skin and does not bind to protein kinase C (Fujicki et al. 1984) . Similar to phorbol ester-type tumor promoters, palytoxin has been found to stimulate arachidonic acid metabolism in rat liver cells (Levine and Fujicki 1985) . Palytoxin also acts synergistically with phorbol ester-type tumor promoters to promote prostaglandin release (Levine and Fujicki 1985; Levine et al. 1986 ) and stimulate histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells (Ouchi et al. 1986 ). Further, palytoxin has been found to inhibit epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding through a pathway that is not dependent upon protein kinase C (Wattenberg et al. 1987) . Palytoxin is commercially available.",

Although in vitro P-388 and C. albicans activities were followed, fractions were also tested in the MLR assay. The cytotoxic fractions also exhibited potent immunosuppressive activity, and ultimately discodermolide was isolated from these fractions. Consequently, discodermolide was found to inhibit the in vitro proliferation of cultured murine P-388 leukemia cells with an IC 50 of 0.5 \u03bc \u00a7/\u03c0\u03b9\u0399. and to suppress the two-way mixed lymphocyte response of both murine splenocytes and human peripheral blood lymphocytes at 0.5 and 5 \u03bcg/mL, respectively.

These values are approximately 8-to 20-fold less potent than those that are commonly reported for suppression of murine MLR responses by the immunosuppressive standard, cyclosporine A (CsA). There was no evidence of cytotoxicity for murine splenocytes at discodermolide concentrations as high as 1.26 \u03bc\u039c. Discodermolide was also active in suppressing the two-way MLR of human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) (IC 50 = 5.7 \u03bc\u039c), of Con A (IC 50 = 28.0 \u03bc\u039c), and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (IC 50 = 30.1 \u03bcM)-stimulated PBL. Discodermolide was not cytotoxic to human PBL at concentrations as high as 80.6 \u03bc\u039c. In a comparison with the standard immunosuppressive agent, CsA, discodermolide was equally effective in inhibiting T-cell receptor (TCR) and accessory cell independent, calcium dependent PMA-ionomycin induced proliferation of purified murine T-lymphocytes, with IC 50 values of 9.0 and 14.0 nM for discodermolide and CsA. These findings suggest that discodermolide's suppressive activity reaches beyond T-cell activation via an inhibition of TCR mediated activation or interference with cell-to-cell interaction of B-cells or macrophages. Discodermolide did not significantly suppress the production of IL-2 in PMAionomycin stimulated murine splenocytes; however, the expression of the p55 associated IL-2 receptor as measured by fluorescence microscopy and flow cy tome trie analyses, using 7D4 antibody in these same cells was reduced. Similar results were obtained with PHA-stimulated blast cells obtained from human PBL in which the expression of p55 \"Tac antigen\" (human IL-2 receptor) was evaluated. The p55 receptor in mouse and human normally has low affinity for IL-2 binding (Malek et al. 1986; Waldman 1986 ). However, this chain associates with an additional cell surface, a 75 kDa (p75) protein to form an IL-2 receptor of high affinity. Before this apparently unique mechanism of action can be ascribed to discodermolide, it would be of great interest to determine if such suppression extends to the high affinity, p55-p75 complex.",

However, the lower dosage groups (1.25 mg/kg) continued to exhibit substantial suppression of their response (93%), but with no associated morbidity. Mice similarly treated with 150 mg/kg of CsA exhibited 80% suppression of the splenomegaly response.

The rather surprising result was that discodermolide did not suppress the SRBC antibody response, even at the highest dosage. By contrast, CsA-treated mice were suppressed in their ability to mount such a response, a result consistent with the known mechanism of action of CsA. This result indicates that the immunosuppressive effect of discodermolide appears not to be of a general nature and, in fact, seems to be unique.",

Fuscoside A (5.23), one of the major components of the extract, was found to reduce phorbol ester (PMA)-induced mouse ear (5.23) edema comparable to indomethacin, whereas fuscoside B (5.24) is slightly less active (Jacobson and Jacobs 1991) .

The antitumor properties of extracts from B. neritina were first demonstrated in 1969 using P-388 murine leukemia (Suffness et al. 1989 ). In one experiment, a %T/C of 168 (400 mg/kg, QD1-10) was observed. However, cytotoxicity was not observed in the KB cell line, which was used routinely at NCI in other projects to monitor fractionation of active extracts. Further, reproducible activity could not be achieved from the evaluation of extracts obtained from different collections of B. neritina, and research on this organism was put aside for several years.",

In later studies , the bryostatins were found to inhibit the growth of A549 lung cancer cells and to inhibit DNA replication, causing translocation of protein kinase C from the cytosol to membranes, and down regulation of protein kinase C, activity similar to that induced by phorbol esters. However, at relatively high concentrations, the bryostatins blocked their own inhibitory effect and the antireplicative action of phorbol esters.

In subsequent land-based assays, the tunicate extracts also exhibited in vitro activity against L1210 murine leukemia and against various RNA and DNA viruses, i.e., HSV-2, vaccinia, influenza (PR8), parainfluenza-3 (HA-1), Coxsackie (A-21), and equine rhino virus. Three compounds were isolated initially, didemnins A through C (5.30A, 5.30B, and 5.30C), which contained both the antiviral activity and the cytotoxicity of the crude extracts (Rinehart et al. 1981b (Rinehart et al. , 1981c . Structurally related compounds didemnins D and E were subsequently isolated and their structures elucidated . A total of 12 didemnins have been detected (Munro et al. 1987) . The didemnins are all cyclic depsipeptides with five or more amino acid units in common. Didemnin D, the largest compound in the series whose structure has been published, contains 12 amino acid units, including standard amino acids (L-Glu, L-Thr, L-Leu, L-Pro), methylated amino acids (D-MeLeu, \u039d,\u039f-dimethyl-L-Tyr), and unusual groups (L-Lac-L-Pro, (3S,4R,5S)-isostatine, and (2S,4S)-hydroxyisovalerylpropionic acid). The isostatine unit was originally thought to be (3S,4R)-statine , and the hydroxyisovalerylpropionic acid was tentatively originally assigned as the 2R,4R-diastereomer and subsequently revised (Ewing et al. 1986 ).",

In the first published study by this group (Montgomery and Zukoski 1985) , didemnin B was found to inhibit the alloantigen response in the MLR, inhibit Con A-induced blastogenesis of T lymphocytes, and inhibit bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)induced blastogenesis of B lymphocytes at nanogram to picogram/milliliter concentrations, which were nontoxic to unstimulated lymphocytes. Didemnin B also inhibited protein synthesis in normal resting splenic mononuclear cells, but at concentrations much greater than those affecting Con A-and LPSinduced mitogenesis, and did not affect RNA synthesis at microgram/milliliter concentrations. Didemnin B also inhibited splenomegaly in the in vivo Simonsen GVHR at 0.05 to 0.3 mg/kg/day; however, concentrations of didem-nin B of >0.2 mg/kg/day caused mortality, primarily through adverse effects on hepatic function.",

In another study (Yuh et al. 1989) , didemnin B was evaluated in mouse and rat heterotopic cardiac transplantation models and the mouse popliteal lymph node hyperplasia assay and found to possess a low therapeutic index, i.e., doses of didemnin B that prolonged allograft survival or inhibited lymphocyte proliferation were quite toxic, evidenced by significant (reversible) body weight loss. Toxicity due to didemnin B appeared to be cumulative, which was presumed to be related to the lipophilicity and, therefore, accumulation of the compound in certain body tissues. The latter study concluded that the in vitro potency of didemnin B was (unfortunately) not sufficient to predict its efficacy as an immunosuppressant in vivo and that a suitable mechanism of action, i.e., as shown by the clinically used agent, cyclosporine, is highly important.",

Manoalide was also shown to be active in antagonizing the inflammatory response of mouse epidermis induced by PMA, with potency greater (ED 50 = 100 \u03bcg) than that of the standard nonsteroidal compound, indomethacin (ED 50 = 250 \u03bcg) but less than that of hydrocortisone (ED 50 = 20 \u03bcg, Burley et al. 1982) . Manoalide, like hydrocortisone, did not prevent the inflammation response normally induced by arachidonic acid, and it was postulated that the compound might inhibit enzyme reactions that were located upstream from arachidonic acid release and prostaglandin synthesis. This hypothesis was supported, in part, by in vivo time course studies showing that manoalide was most effective when applied within 5 minutes of PMA application, a very early time point considering the normal 3-hour period it required for the inflammatory reaction to manifest itself. Speculation at that time on the mechanism of action of both indomethacin, which prevents prostaglandin production by inhibition of the cyclooxygenase pathway, and hydrocortisone, which prevents prostaglandin production by inhibiting arachidonic acid release, led to the hypothesis that manoalide might serve to inactivate or inhibit various actions of the enzyme PLA 2 . In one study (de Freitas et al. 1984) , manoalide (2 x 10 ~5 M) was shown to prevent the neurotoxic action of \u00df-bungarotoxin on rat phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparations when preincubated with the toxin for as little as 25 minutes. In the same study, manoalide inhibited the hydrolysis of phosphatidylchohne by bee venom-derived PLA 2 , when preincubated with the enzyme for 1 hour. Subsequent studies demonstrated the irreversibility of the reaction and its pH dependence Jacobs 1984, 1986 ). Manoalide has also been shown to inhibit the activity of PLA 2 from other sources, including cobra venom (Lombardo and Dennis 1985) , while manoalide blocked the hydrolysis of both phosphatidylchohne and phosphatidylethanolamine by bee venom PLA 2 .",

A key component of many inflammatory mediators and growth factors is their ability to bind to cellular receptors that, in turn, stimulate phosphoinositide turnover and Ca 2+ mobilization as part of the signal transduction pathway. The major role of PLC in this process includes the activation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate (PIP 2 ), which gives rise to inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP 3 ) and 1,2 diacylglycerol (DAG) (Berridge 1983) . The IP 3 serves as a second messenger and binds to a receptor on the rough endoplasmic reticulum, which causes the release of Ca 2+ from intracellular stores. DAG, on the other hand, is the physiological receptor for protein kinase C, an important second messenger enzyme involved in the regulation of cellular proliferation. While manoalide's primary pharmacological action involves inhibition of PLA 2 activity, as previously noted, manoalide's less potent, but measureable inhibition of PLC activity prompted further investigations into its role as an antagonist of calcium-mediated, signal transduction-mediated control of cellular growth and regulation.",

Manoalide blocked both the EGF-mediated entry and release of Ca 2+ from intracellular stores in a time-dependent manner with an IC 50 of 0.4 \u03bc\u039c. However, the production of inositol monophosphate (phosphoinositide metabolism) did not coincide with the EGF-mediated response.

The first total enantiospecific synthesis of pseudopterosin E was reported through the direct attachment of an L-fucose unit to the aglycone via a novel method (Corey and Carpino 1989) . A method for the synthesis of pseudopterosin A was similarly described. Other investigations revealed alternate pathways for obtaining both the glycosylated form and the aglycone of pseudopterosin E (Broka et al. 1988; Ganguly et al. 1990 ).

These discoveries aided in the development of antitumor agents and a generation of nucleoside antivirals. Through sporadic synthetic analog efforts to improve the activities of the compounds, cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) (5.33C) was introduced nearly 20 years later as a clinically useful antitumor agent (Bodey et al. 1969) , and nearly 30 years later, adenine arabinoside (Ara-A) (5.33D) was approved for use as an antiviral agent (Buchanan and Hess 1980) . Cytosine arabinoside is produced synthetically, currently distributed as Cytosar-U\u00ae and indicated in acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelocytic leukemia, and meningeal leukemia (Physicians Desk Reference 1991). Adenine arabinoside is obtained from fermentation cultures of Streptomyces antibioticus and currently distributed as Vira-A\u00ae (Physicians Desk Reference 1991). Through intravenous administration, Vira-A is indicated for the treatment of Herpes simplex virus encephalitis, Herpes simplex infections in newborns, and Herpes zoster virus due to reactivated varicela-roster virus infections in immunosuppressed patients. As an ointment, Vira-A\u00ae is used for the topical treatment of epithelial keratitis caused by Herpes simplex. Subsequent second-and third-generation nucleosides, i.e., acyclovir, AZT and dideoxycytidine, are highly useful antiviral agents and the objects of further medicinal chemistry studies to find even more efficacious and selective compounds.

Over the past three decades, over 4000 novel compounds have been described from marine organisms (reviews by Faulkner 1984a Faulkner , 1984b Faulkner , 1986 Faulkner , 1987 Faulkner ,1988 Faulkner , 1990 Faulkner , 1991 , some of which possess striking biological activities, and have been described in this chapter. In addition, recent reports on the results of marine extract screening strongly suggest that the marine environment holds promise for a continued high abundance of biologically active compounds (Munro et al. 1987) . Marine natural products, due to their unrivaled degree of structural novelty, have served to inspire many of the great synthetic achievements in organic chemistry. Thus, with the great structural novelty and high degree of biological activity associated with this group of substances, why is it that, in the past 5 to 10 years, there have been no new marinederived compounds that began as NCEs (new chemical entities) in the United States on the market?",

Indeed, marine-derived compounds of current clinical interest (see Section 5.5) are the products of marine drug discovery programs smaller in scope and number than those that exist today, and most of the current industrial marine drug discovery efforts were initiated just within the last 5 years.

The overall composition of this total is somewhat unclear since it is likely comprised of numerous sources such as extracts of fermentation products, natural substances, pure synthetics, etc., and statistical comparisons must be interpreted with caution. It is clear, however, that even today's heightened level of marine-derived compound and extract screening (a few thousand per year perhaps) represents only a small portion of this amount. Consideration of the scope of therapeutic areas screened shows a parallel situation. During the 1970s and early 1980s, marine screening efforts were focused, with some exceptions, in the areas of antitumor, cytotoxics, antiviral, and antimicrobials. These areas represent only a portion of the full range of human disease areas. Today, in addition to these, investigations of marine products in immunomodulation, inflammation, cardiovascular, central nervous system, hypertension, to name only a few, are now well underway.

In contrast, pure didemnin B and bryostatin 1 were obtained for clinical trials from massive field collections of the source organisms Trididemnum solidum and Bugula neritina (Schaufelberger et al. 1991 ), respectively. Didemnin B and bryostatin 1 serve well to illustrate a central problem of marine drug development, that of compound supply. While the biological richness of the marine environment is well appreciated, the prospects are usually not good for producing large amounts (kilograms) of marine compounds using field collection of organisms. Only the most abundant marine organisms can be collected in these amounts. An additional complication is the well-established variation in chemistry within a species as a function of geographical location. Thus, only in select cases with highly abundant organisms (i.e., some sponges, bryozoans, gorgonians, or algae) are extremely large-scale collections possible, and even then, environmental consequences can be severe. Therefore, while in some cases it might be possible to produce amounts of marine compound sufficient for preliminary clinical trial (gram quantities) from collection of the source organism, this approach cannot produce quantities needed for extended trials and the market (tens of kilograms).",

Fermentation is a mainstay in the pharmaceutical industry for compound production, in many cases providing supplies of structurally complex antibiotics, antitumor antibiotics, and immune suppressants, which are economically inaccessible by chemical synthesis. Fermentation of marine microorganisms may provide additional benefits outside drug development. An example of this is the culture of thermophilic bacteria isolated from marine geothermal sites (Borman 1991) , whose thermally robust enzymes may have potential utility as industrial catalysts for the production of fuels, pharmaceuticals, or specialty chemicals. Indeed, the origin of several bioactive marine natural products isolated from sponges (Stierle et al. 1988; Elyakov et al. 1991 ) and other macroorganisms (Tamplin 1990 ) have been traced to microbial symbionts, and reports of success in the culture of these microorganisms are becoming more frequent.",

Chemical synthesis or modification of natural com-pounds yields the majority of chemotherapeutic agents in the U.S. market, especially in certain disease areas. Due to the inherent supply problem described previously, even in cases where the original, parent compound might be a suitable drug candidate, chemical synthesis is still likely to become the means by which suitable quantities are produced for advanced clinical investigation and marketing. The natural outgrowth of such a synthetic effort is the investigation of analogs as part of a medicinal chemistry effort. This brings forth another scenario.",

Programs of this type are designed with several goals in mind, not the least of which is the discovery of structural analogs exhibiting improved therapeutic attributes and simpler (i.e., more economical) chemical structures, as well as trying to secure sufficiently broad and appropriate patent coverage. An illustrative case of such a scenario is available in the case of manoalide (see Section 5.5.3), a compound isolated from the marine sponge Luffariella variabilis (de Silva and Scheuer 1980) . Manoalide was found to be a specific inhibitor of phospholipase A 2 and C and is currently under development as an anti-inflammatory agent (see Section 5.5.3). The synthesis and evaluation of an extensive series of analogs was undertaken by several pharmaceutical companies and some of this work has been reported in the patent literature as well as the open literature (Garst et al. 1986; Katsumura et al. 1985; Lee 1990a Lee , 1990b Maullem et al. 1989 ). Consequently, manoalide and selected synthetic analogs have been evaluated as topical anti-inflammatory agents in clinical trials (R. Jacobs, personal communication).",
