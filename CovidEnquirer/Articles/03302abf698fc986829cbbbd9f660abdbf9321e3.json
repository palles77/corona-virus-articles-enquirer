            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a highly contagious respiratory coronavirus of domestic chickens. Although mortality is low, infection with IBV results in substantial losses for the egg and meat chicken industries. Despite the economic importance of IBV and decades of research into the pathogenesis of infection, significant gaps in our knowledge exist. The aim of this study was to compare the early progression of air sac lesions in birds receiving a vaccine strain of the virus or a more virulent field strain. The air sacs are lined by different types of epithelia and are relatively isolated from the environment, so they represent a unique tissue in which to study virus-induced lesions. Both the pathogenic and vaccine strains of the virus produced significant lesions; however, the lesions progressed more rapidly in the birds receiving the pathogenic strain. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that in birds infected with the pathogenic strain of virus, IBV spike protein is detected first in the ciliated cells lining the air sac. These preliminary data provide important clues regarding potential mechanisms for IBV tissue tropism and spread and show that the nature of the virus isolate influences the early progression of IBV infection.",

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) primarily causes an acute respiratory disease in domestic chickens. The disease is characterized by high morbidity, low mortality and substantial loss of production. The respiratory disease caused by IBV was first reported in the USA in 1930 and a single IBV serotype was described (Cavenagh and Naqi, 2003) . Since the initial description of the disease, several other syndromes, including renal disease, proventricular disease and egg malformations, have been associated with this virus. Furthermore, over 20 serotypes of IBV are now recognized, with several circulating in the USA at any one time. Massachusetts, Connecticut and California serotypes are currently of the greatest economic importance (Cavenagh and Naqi, 2003) . Worldwide, several other significant isolates, unique to particular regions, in-cluding Africa, Asia and Europe, have been described (Cavenagh and Naqi, 2003) .",

However, the molecular basis for serotype-specific differences is not fully understood. Some serotypes never replicate outside the respiratory tract, while others can persist in the kidney, proventriculus or oviduct. Laboratory and in-vivo experiments prove that the pathogenicity and tissue tropism varies between serotypes and that significant variation in pathogenicity exists, even between different isolates of the same serotype (Purcell and McFerran, 1972) . Understanding the genetic basis for this observation has proven difficult. Virus binding and entry into cells are complex events, which depend on several viral genes, phase of the cell cycle of the target cell and pH (Lukert, 1972; Shen et al., 2004 Shen et al., , 2010 Chu et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2007; Ammayappan et al., 2009; Armesto et al., 2009 ).",

The air sacs are poorly vascularized and, due to their blind-ended structure and limited interconnectivity, provide a relatively sequestered environment in which pathogens can flourish (Cook et al., 1987) . These anatomical features also make the air sacs ideal membranes on which to study the effects of IBV on respiratory epithelia. Injection of IBV directly into the air sacs allows a more controlled method of infection than traditional intraocular or aerosol infection. In the latter infection methods, the amount of virus that reaches the target tissue (usually the trachea) cannot be easily controlled. These methods rely on the bird inhaling particles and not sneezing or coughing during the infection procedure. In contrast, direct injection into the air sac allows for controlled delivery of the agent into a specific anatomical area. The procedure is sim-ple, relying on the identification of easily detected landmarks. The injection causes little or no distress to the bird as it is shallow; the air sac lies just beneath the skin and a small needle can be used to minimize pain to the bird. The major drawback of this method is the difficulty in handling the air sacs for histopathological processing. However, the method developed by Bezuidenhout (2005a) allows for relatively easy handling of these thin membranes and the generation of high-quality histological preparations.",

The results of the present immunohistochemical study indicate that IBV infects initially the ciliated epithelial cells and then enters the squamous cells. The IBV S1 and S2 proteins were first detected in the air sacs at 9 hpi. During early infection, immunoreactivity was largely confined to the columnar respiratory epithelial cells, with rare labelling of widely scattered squamous cells. Thus, the ciliated respiratory epithelial cells are the early sites of S1 and S2 protein expression. The rare labelling of the squamous cells may in fact represent labelling of the widely scattered ciliated squamous cells; however, the histological detail was not sufficient to clearly identify cilia on the surface of these cells. By 12 hpi, squamous epithelial cells adjacent to the respiratory epithelial islands demonstrated IBV immunoreactivity and by 24 hpi there was uniform labelling of the epithelium. The initial involvement of the respiratory epithelium is further illustrated by the fact that inflammatory cells were concentrated beneath this tissue early in infection. After infection with the field strain of the virus, vascular changes and cellular infiltrates were most pronounced in areas just beneath the islands of respiratory epithelium. Early vascular lesions were detected at 6 hpi, 3 h before the S1 or S2 proteins could be detected by IHC; hence, the bird was responding to a stimulus prior to the expression of a major viral antigen. Similarly, the intensity of inflammation increased as the infection progressed. Inflammation was most intense beneath respiratory islands and areas of ulceration, but spread to adjacent areas by 9e48 hpi. This pattern preceded the spread of immunoreactivity, but followed the same pattern of spread; beginning near respiratory epithelial islands and spreading to adjacent loci.",

More work is needed to determine whether the observed difference could be due to either the ability of the cells to become infected or the ability of the virus to reproduce in the infected cell. Differences in the ability of the cells to become infected would most likely be a receptor-mediated event. The IBV receptor could be present only on the respiratory epithelium, with infection of the squamous cell occurring by cell-to-cell spread. Based on the finding that the squamous epithelial cells adjacent to the respiratory epithelial islands were the first squamous cells to demonstrate significant immunoreactivity, we propose cell-to-cell spread as a possible mechanism of virus transfer.",

Higher density of cell surface receptors would favour early virus entry, while it would be prolonged in cells with a low density of receptors. Alternatively, IBV could use multiple methods or receptors to enter cells. The receptors on ciliated cells could be more permissive than those on the squamous cells, thus allowing earlier virus entry. Such variation in cell entry methods has been postulated for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus of man. Angiotensin-2 converting enzyme has been shown to be a receptor for SARS coronavirus, but the virus may also enter via lectins or by direct membrane fusion (Wang et al., 2007) . The squamous and ciliated epithelial cells in the avian air sacs express different membrane lectins; therefore, differences in membrane molecule expression may play a role in viral tropism. IBV potentially enters target cells via sialic acid or heparin sulphate receptors; however, other factors may mediate its spread to different epithelial cell types (Winter et al., 2006 (Winter et al., , 2008 Madu et al., 2007; Abd El Rahman et al., 2009) .",

Additionally, inoculation of the field isolate was accompanied by a much greater degree of epithelial necrosis than was infection with the vaccine strain.",

            "text": "The present study has not only demonstrated that the type of inflammatory cell influx varies during very acute infection, but also defines a slightly different type of inflammation than has been previously described. As in previous studies, few inflammatory cells were detected in normal avian respiratory tissue; however, after stimulation there was a rapid influx (Reese et al., 2006) . Because we examined birds very early post infection, we were able to document early fluctuations in the type of infiltrating cells. Previous studies that have focused on later events during infection have indicated that air sac lesions are accompanied by a predominantly heterophilic response (Purcell and McFerran, 1972; Purcell et al., 1976) . In the present study, macrophages and lymphocytes were the main cells infiltrating the air sacs early in infection, with heterophils only appearing after significant necrosis and ulceration of the air sac epithelium. It is unclear whether the heterophil influx was a result of a specific virus-mediated effect or was simply a response to tissue necrosis. The initial infiltrate of macrophages into the infected tissues indicates that these cells have an important role to play in the pathogenesis of IBV infection. Unlike in mammals, the first line of defence against pathogens in birds is the macrophage (Qureshi et al., 2000) .",

The morphological findings show the importance of ciliated epithelium in virus entry. Moreover, the lesions produced by the two virus isolates were similar; however, the field strain elicited a more rapid inflammatory response. It is possible that the slower progression of vaccine strain-induced infection allows the bird to mount a protective immune response prior to significant damage developing. If the molecular basis for the slower progression of disease can be determined, it is possible that specific viral or immune molecules could be used to develop new vaccines to IBV infection, which may enhance the ability of the bird to respond to infection The molecular mechanisms for the observed findings are currently being explored. It is hoped that future studies combining molecular and morphological studies of IBV disease progression will one day lead to better control of this important respiratory disease.",
