This homeothermic state is achieved by physiologic and behavioral mechanisms that modify either rates of heat loss from the body or the rate at which heat is produced by the metabolism of feed or body energy reserves. For the body temperature to remain constant in changing thermal environments, the rate of heat loss must equal the rate of heat gain. The body temperature is a reflection of the balance between heat gain from the environment (radiation, conduction, and convection) or caused by metabolic activity (maintenance, exercise, growth, lactation, gestation, and feeding) and heat loss to the environment (radiation, conduction, convection, and evaporation) or caused by metabolic activity (milk removal, fecal elimination, and urinary elimination). Absorption of heat from the environment occurs when the external temperature rises above that of the body.",

Convection is a transfer of heat between two media at different temperatures such as the coat surface and the air. As such, convective heat transfer depends on the temperature gradient between the coat surface and air, the surface area, and the air speed over the surface. Conduction is the transfer of heat between two media that are in direct contact such as the skin and water. Radiation is the absorption or emission of electromagnetic radiation at the body surface and depends on the skin surface temperature and area. Evaporative heat transfer is a process by which heat is lost by the evaporation of water and is dependent on the water vapor pressure gradient between the epithelial surface and the environment and the air speed over the surface.",

Losses by evaporation of moisture vary between species depending on the development of the sweat gland system and are less important in animals than in humans, beginning only at relatively high body temperatures. Horses sweat profusely, but in pigs, sheep, goats, New World camelids, and European cattle sweating cannot be considered to be an effective mechanism of evaporative heat loss. In zebu cattle the increased density of cutaneous sweat glands suggests that sweating may be more important. Profuse salivation and exaggerated respiration, including mouth breathing, are important mechanisms in the dissipation of excess body heat in animals. The tidal volume is decreased and the respiratory rate is increased at high body temperatures so that heat is lost but alkalemia caused by respiratory alkalosis is avoided.",

Heat storage occurs and the body temperature rises when there is a decrease in rate and depth of respiration, constriction of skin blood vessels, cessation of perspiration, and increased muscle tone.

Increased heat production in neonatal calves in the first several hours after birth can be significant when the animals first stand for 10 minutes; this effect is reproduced later when the calves are stronger and stand for longer periods. The principal site of coldinduced nonshivering thermogenesis in animals is brown adipose tissue, which is present in neonatal lambs, kids, and calves but not in piglets.

Prolonged periods of exposure below the cold lethal limit will result in death. The cold lethal limit also can be defined as the ambient temperature below which heat loss exceeds the animal's summit or maximal metabolism. Because published values for lower critical temperatures assume still air, dry clean coats, standard radiation, and a standing animal given a maintenance level of feeding, there continue to be limitations to their use. Insulation of extremities decreases, and heat loss increases, at temperatures below freezing. Thus some lower critical temperatures for cattle are too low, which means that neonates may be affected by cold temperatures not normally considered harmful. External insulation can change because of changes in air velocity and long-wave radiation. Behavioral changes of animals may occur to minimize heat loss. For example, animals may orient toward the wind to decrease their profile, and they may seek shelter, huddle, and change their posture. Solar radiation varies throughout the daylight hours depending on the quantity of cloud. Generally, radiation balance is positive in the day, whereas at night, when the skies are clear, the radiation balance is usually negative. Heat production varies with the time of day and time since the last meal and physical activity.

Thyroid hormones also have an essential role in regulating cold thermogenesis. Glucocorticoids are essential for cold thermogenesis through the mobilization of lipid and glycogen to supply energy substrates. Large deposits of brown adipose tissue are present in the abdominal cavity (perirenal), around large blood vessels, and in the inguinal and prescapular areas. In calves, brown fat may represent 20 g/kg body weight (BW) and in lambs from well-fed ewes, brown fat may represent 6g/kg BW. At parturition, marked changes occur in both the neonate's supply and demand for nutrients. In utero the fetal ruminant is provided with high levels of carbohydrate and low levels of fat, whereas after birth it is provided with colostrum high in fat and low in carbohydrate. Before colostrum is fed, the neonatal ruminant depends on mobilization of tissue glycogen and lipids to provide energy substrates for basal metabolism as well as thermogenesis in shivering muscle tissue and in brown adipose tissue.

Therefore lightweight neonates have a lower summit metabolic rate per unit of surface area and, consequently, lightweight neonates will be less cold tolerant than heavyweight neonates.

Twin and triplet lambs are more susceptible to hypothermia than singles because of lower body energy reserves; the ewe takes longer to lick dry two or three lambs, and the milk requirement of two or three lambs is higher than that of a single lamb and starvation is more likely.",

Lambs of any age with mild hypothermia (37-39\u00b0C) are dried off if necessary to reduce heat loss, given ewe or cow colostrum by stomach tube, and placed in a sheltered pen with the ewe. Lambs less than 5 hours of age with severe hypothermia (<37\u00b0C) are dried off and given an intraperitoneal injection of 20% glucose at a temperature of 39\u00b0C. A large lamb (>4.5 kg) is given 50 mL, a medium lamb (3.0-4.5 kg) 35 mL, and a small lamb (<3.0 kg) 25 mL. Hypothermic lambs are then placed in warming pens, measuring 2 \u00d7 2 m and made of horizontally laid straw bales, two bales high. The pen is divided horizontally into two chambers by a sheet of weld mesh upon which the lambs lie. Warm air, at 38 to 40\u00b0C, is blown into the lower chamber from a domestic heater, and a sheet of polythene fitted over the entire pen retains the heat. When the lamb's temperature reaches 37\u00b0C, it is removed from the warmer and immediately fed ewe or cow colostrum by stomach tube at a rate of 50 mL/kg BW. Any lamb that is vigorous and able to suck is returned to its ewe in a sheltered pen and monitored over the next several hours. Colostrum can be hand milked from the ewe after administration of oxytocin.",

Fluids given intravenously must be warmed but their temperature usually decreases to the ambient environmental temperature before entering the jugular vein. Submersion of the intravenous line in a sustained source of hot water and ensuring an appropriate environmental temperature can mitigate the cooling of intravenously administered fluids before they reach the calf. Intravenous dextrose (1 mL of 50% dextrose per kilogram BW) should be routinely administered to all hypothermic calves because most have moderate to severe hypoglycemia. This dosage rate of 50% dextrose will increase the serum glucose concentration of the calf by approximately 100 mg/dL, assuming that the extracellular fluid space is 50% of the calf 's body weight.

The upper critical temperature in sheep with a light wool coat on board ship appears to be 35\u00b0C (95\u00b0F) at a humidity of 33 to 39 mm Hg (4.4-5.2 kPa) vapor pressure. Differences between breeds of animal in their tolerance to environmental high temperatures, exposure to sunlight, and exercise are important in animal management and production. Holstein cows carrying the slick hair gene (phenotypically having a short, sleek and sometimes glossy hair coat) are better able to regulate body temperature during heat stress than wild-type Holsteins, with slick-haired animals having an increased sweating rate. 1 Water buffalo have been shown to be less heat tolerant than Shorthorn steers, which were less tolerant than Javanese Banteng and Brahman crossbreeds (the last two appear to be equally tolerant). The differences appear to be at least partly caused by the capacity to increase cutaneous evaporation under heat stress. There are similar differences in heat tolerance between lactating and nonlactating cows; lactating animals show significantly greater increases in rectal temperature and heart and respiratory rates when the environmental temperature is raised. This is primarily a result of the greater dry matter intake and heat of fermentation in dairy cattle that must be dissipated.

Common inflammatory processes include the following: \u2022 Abscesses of the peritoneum, pleura, and lungs \u2022 Septic metritis \u2022 Endocarditis \u2022 Polyarthritis \u2022 Pyelonephritis Many animals are placed in the category of fever of unknown origin because the veterinarian overlooks, disregards, or rejects an obvious clue. No algorithms or computerassisted diagnostic programs are likely to solve this diagnostic challenge. To improve the diagnostic accuracy veterinarians will have to work harder. This requires obtaining a detailed history, repeated physical examinations, reconsideration of the epidemiologic characteristics of the affected animal, requesting consultations from colleagues, and the investment of time to consider the diagnosis and the circumstances.",

There has been increased interest in measuring the serum concentration of acute phase reactants to monitor the severity of an infectious disease, assist in making a diagnosis, and to verify that an animal produced for food is healthy and fit for slaughter. During the hepatic acute phase response, the liver increases the synthesis of specific proteins (positive acute phase proteins) in response to release of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 (proinflammatory cytokines) from macrophages and monocytes, whereas albumin synthesis is reduced (negative acute phase protein). Interleukin-1\u03b2 induces type 1 acute phase proteins (serum amyloid A [SAA] and C-reactive protein) within 4 hours. Interleukin-6 induces haptoglobin at a later stage with serum concentrations remaining elevated for up to 2 weeks. A clinically important issue is that IL-1\u03b2 is the primary initiator of fever as well as an important upstream initiator of the acute phase response; therefore, it remains to be determined whether laboratory measurement of acute phase reactant concentration in plasma provides practical information beyond that provided by rectal temperature alone. It should be recognized that although the liver plays a central role in the acute phase response, extrahepatic tissues, such as the bovine mammary gland, can also synthesize acute phase reactants. Fibrinogen is the most widely studied positive acute phase protein in large animals.",

The most clinically relevant acute phase reactant in the horse appears to be SAA, because SAA concentrations are extremely low in healthy horses, increase markedly and rapidly during the acute phase of inflammation, and decrease rapidly after recovery because of its short half-life. 1, 3, 4 The clinical utility of SAA as a marker of infection is decreased in neonatal foals because SAA concentrations increase for up to 7 days in response to inflammation associated with vaginal delivery and absorption of amyloid A present in colostrum. 5 Serum amyloid A, haptoglobin, and fibrinogen are important positive acute phase proteins in cattle and are produced by the liver in response to endogenous release of glucocorticoids and proinflammatory cytokines. Of these acute phase reactants, SAA is considered to have the most diagnostic utility in cattle. A potential confounder for the interpretation of SAA concentration in cattle is that its concentration normally increases at calving. 6 This means that an increased SAA concentration is not specific for inflammation or bacterial infection in the postparturient dairy cow and may be more associated with the extent of hepatic lipidosis than the presence of an inflammatory process in early lactation. 6, 7 Serum or plasma haptoglobin concentration is increased in cows with hepatic lipidosis, displaced abomasum, traumatic reticuloperitonitis, respiratory disease, mastitis, metritis, pododermatitis, and renal amyloidosis. 6, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] More research is needed to increase our understanding of changes in the concentration and kinetics of haptoglobin in cattle. C-reactive protein does not appear to be an acute phase reactant in cattle. The increase in SAA and haptoglobin in cattle appears to be dose dependent; therefore, the magnitude of the increase reflects the severity of the underlying inflammatory process. 13, 14 Important negative acute phase proteins in cattle include albumin, transferrin, and paraoxonase. 8 Albumin does not appear to be as sensitive an acute phase reactant as SAA in cattle. Moreover, serum albumin concentrations are decreased for 2 weeks after calving in lactating dairy cattle, partly as a result of increased plasma volume and decreased albumin synthesis, 6 further decreasing the clinical utility of serum albumin concentration as an acute phase reactant in postparturient cattle. The acute phase response in sheep appears similar to that in cattle. 15 Plasma or serum iron concentrations decrease as part of the acute phase response; this has been attributed to sequestration of iron stores by the animal to make less iron available for bacterial growth. 16 Inflammation causes the release of IL-6 that stimulates hepatocytes to release the peptide hormone hepcidin, which blocks iron efflux from macrophages, directly resulting in hypoferremia. 16 Plasma iron concentration appears to be a better acute phase reactant than fibrinogen concentration in horses. 16 ",

            "text": "Animals have evolved to recognize and respond to the lipopolysaccharide of gramnegative bacteria. Although lipopolysaccharides may directly injure the host tissue, many of its effects are indirectly mediated through inappropriate activation of host defense mechanisms, culminating in multiple organ dysfunction and failure. Importantly, the response to endotoxin can be attenuated with certain substances. Experimentally, the use of detergents, such as a nonionic surfactant, can attenuate the response of the horse given endotoxin. There is a large individual variability in the response to endotoxin administration. Much of the variability remains unexplained but appears to have a genetic component. 1 Circulating lipopolysaccharide forms complexes in plasma with high-density lipoproteins or a unique plasma protein termed LBP and bound lipopolysaccharide is cleared from plasma within a few minutes by fixed and circulating macrophages in the bovine lung and liver that recognizes the lipopolysaccharide-LBP complex. The lipopolysaccharide-LBP complex binds to a membrane-bound receptor (mCD14) on mononuclear cells via a secreted linking protein called MD-2 and then attaches to tolllike receptor-4 (TLR-4) on the mononuclear cell membrane; the lipopolysaccharide-LBP-mCD14-MD-2 complex is then internalized and lipopolysaccharide is thought to be destroyed in the process. Internalization of lipopolysaccharide activates the intracellular signaling pathway via nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB), which translocates to the nucleus and causes the transcription of many cytokine genes and release of proinflammatory cytokines, of which TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, and IL-6 are the most important. Some of the genes activated include those that code for cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2, the inducible form of cyclooxygenase); inducible nitric oxide; endothelial adhesion molecules, which promote the adhesion of neutrophils to endothelial surfaces; and chemokines. Some of the membrane-bound receptors (mCD14) are shed from the cell surface into the plasma; in plasma the shed receptors are termed soluble CD14 receptors (sCD14), which play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of endotoxemia. This is because sCD14 receptors can transfer bound lipopolysaccharide directly to mCD14 or the MD-2/TLR-4 complex, activating the intracellular signaling pathway. Increased serum concentrations of sCD14 are associated with the severity of some clinical signs in critically ill horses. 2 The plasma concentrations of the arachidonic acid metabolites, thromboxane A 2 and prostacyclin, increase in several species during endotoxemia, and these eicosanoids are probably responsible for the hemodynamic abnormalities caused by endotoxin. Endotoxin initiates cellular events that activate a cell-membrane enzyme known as phospholipase A 2 . Activation of this enzyme leads to the hydrolysis of membrane-bound phospholipids; arachidonic acid is released from the phospholipid portion of damaged mammalian cell membranes. The enzyme cyclooxygenase converts arachidonic acid into intermediate endoperoxides, which are substrates for the formation of prostaglandins, thromboxane, and prostacyclin, by specific synthetases. Platelets are the principal source of thromboxane, which acts as a potent vasoconstrictor and induces platelet aggregation. Most prostacyclins are synthesized in vascular endothelial cells and cause vasodilation and inhibit platelet aggregation. The generalized endotoxin-induced production of cyclooxygenase products may contribute to the multisystemic organ dysfunction, shock, and disseminated coagulopathy that culminates in death.",

The presence of leukopenia or lymphopenia in a foal with presumed sepsis makes it more likely that a gram-negative septicemia is present. 4 Endotoxemia causes an acute and severe neutropenia, which precedes neutrophilia and hemoconcentration. Neutropenia is caused mainly by leukocyte margination and sequestration; persistence of severe neutropenia is a poor prognostic indicator. Hemoconcentration is caused by movement of fluid from the vascular to extravascular spaces. Endotoxin administration causes an immediate accumulation, margination, and activation of leukocytes in the microcirculation, particularly in the alveolar capillaries. This is followed by degranulation and leukocyte migration into the interstitium and endothelial cell damage. Pulmonary sequestration of neutrophils is preceded by endotoxin uptake by pulmonary intravascular macrophages, indicating that the pulmonary macrophage response is pivotal to the subsequent inflammatory response. Leukopenia appears to be an immediate response to endotoxin administration and is observed as early as 5 minutes after infusion. The rebound leukocytosis is caused by humoral effects on the bone marrow; a neutrophil-releasing factor that promotes release of neutrophils from bone marrow; and macrophage colonystimulating factor, which stimulates granulopoiesis. Colostrum-fed calves have a greater neutrophilia in response to endotoxin than colostrum-deprived calves, possibly because of absorption of a granulopoietic factor from colostrum. Endotoxemia also induces a lymphopenia that is secondary to the release of endogenous corticosteroids and redistribution of lymphocytes from peripheral blood and the spleen to lymphatic tissue.",

The choice and route of administration will depend on the pathogens suspected of causing the infection and endotoxemia and the site of infection. The speed of kill of gram-negative bacteria may be an important clinical issue, because antimicrobial agents with a rapid kill (such as moxalactam) can produce a bolus release of endotoxin into the bloodstream by punching multiple holes in the bacteria, causing a rapid explosion of the bacteria caused by osmotic fluid shifts and bolus release of endotoxin. Antimicrobial agents that alter the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria can theoretically produce a bolus release of endotoxin when administered to animals with gram-negative septicemia. On this basis, \u03b2-lactam antibiotics effective against gramnegative bacteria should theoretically be avoided; however, clinical experience has not indicated deleterious effects following administration of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. Moreover, coadministration of aminoglycosides blocks the potential bolus release of endotoxin by \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. However, it is clinically prudent to ensure that whenever antimicrobial treatment is initiated in endotoxemic animals that NSAIDs are administered concurrently. It is also important to adjust dosage rates of water-soluble antibiotics in neonatal animals because some antibiotics, such as gentamicin in foals and ceftiofur in calves, have a larger volume of distribution and slower clearance in neonatal animals. 13",

Flunixin meglumine also modulates the acute hemodynamic changes and hyper l-lactatemia commonly seen during endotoxemia, which may increase survival rate. Endotoxin-stimulated production of thromboxane B 2 (a metabolite of thromboxane) and prostaglandin F 1\u03b1 are blocked by flunixin meglumine at 0.25 and 0.1 mg/kg, respectively, which resulted in a widespread clinical use of an antiendotoxemic dose of 0.25 mg/kg. However, the term antiendotoxemic effect should be discouraged because it is misleading, and a dose rate of 1.1 mg/kg BW IV every 12 hours is recommended in horses. Care should be taken to ensure adequate hydration in endotoxemic animals receiving multiple doses of flunixin meglumine. It is usually given intravenously US label is only for IV use in cattle at 1.1 to 2.2 mg/kg BW every 24 hours. The oral administration of flunixin meglumine at 2.2 mg/kg BW before experimentally induced endotoxemia in cattle exerted an effect equal to that after intravenous administration by minimizing the fever and prostaglandin F 2\u03b1 metabolite concentration induced by the endotoxin administration. However, flunixin meglumine did not prevent the decrease in peripheral mononuclear cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes seen after endotoxin administration. The bioavailability of flunixin meglumine in cattle ranges from 53% to 60% in cattle and 80% to 86% in horses.",

Although flunixin meglumine is the most widely used NSAID in endotoxemia, there is little experimental evidence demonstrating its efficacy over other NSAIDs. Ketoprofen, flunixin meglumine, ketorolac, and phenylbutazone have been compared for treating experimental endotoxemia in calves. Each drug modified the response to endotoxin but none was clearly superior to the others in modulating the clinical signs. Phenylbutazone given to calves at 5 mg/kg BW/day intravenously for 5 days suppressed the clinical response to experimental endotoxin in neonatal calves with progressively increasing amounts of endotoxin until large amounts were given. There were no significant differences between ketoprofen and flunixin meglumine in in vitro studies of the effects of the drugs on equine peripheral blood monocytes. An interesting finding in adult dairy cows with experimentally induced endotoxemia was that flunixin meglumine and phenylbutazone delayed the plasma clearance of endotoxin by 2 to 3 and 6 to 12 times, respectively, suggesting that both NSAIDs may prolong the clinical signs of endotoxemia in cattle, possibly by interfering with hepatic metabolism. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Flunixin meglumine has been associated with impaired healing of the intestinal tract, injury to the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys, and increased intestinal permeability to lipopolysaccharide. 19 Glucocorticoids Glucocorticoids (corticosteroids) have been used extensively in the past for the treatment of endotoxemia and shock. The rationale for the use of glucocorticoids includes the following: \u2022 Organelle and cell-membrane stabilization \u2022 Improved cellular metabolism and gluconeogenesis \u2022 Improved microcirculation \u2022 Decreased production of endogenous toxins such as myocardial depressant factor \u2022 Decreased leukocyte activation and degranulation \u2022 Minimal reticuloendothelial depression and histologic organ damage The corticosteroids most commonly used in endotoxic shock were hydrocortisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, and dexamethasone. However, these corticosteroids have been most beneficial therapeutically when given as a pretreatment in experimental situations. Published evidence, based on controlled clinical trials, that corticosteroids are efficacious in naturally occurring cases of endotoxemic shock in humans and farm animals is lacking.",

There are also difficulties with spatial hindrance between IgG and the R-core subfraction of lipopolysaccharide that contains lipid A. It is therefore difficult to think that antiserum against core lipopolysaccharide antigens will ever be therapeutically successful in animals with naturally acquired endotoxemia, and large-scale studies in septic humans have failed to observe a decrease in mortality following the administration of hyperimmune core-lipopolysaccharide plasma. However, the administration of plasma containing antiserum has many theoretical advantages separate from those of endotoxin neutralization, and it may be that plasma transfusion alone is beneficial.",

It is assumed that a combination of impaired neutrophil function; abnormal postpartum uterine involution, often with retained fetal membranes; and infection of the uterus precipitates the disease. A mixed bacterial flora is common, which includes organisms such as Trueperella (Arcanobacterium or Actinomyces or Corynebacterium) pyogenes, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Prevotella melaninogenica, Bacteroides spp. Streptococcus uberis; these commonly predominate as a mixed flora in cows with retained placenta and postpartum metritis, particularly after 5 to 7 days postpartum. Other observations found that E. coli predominates in cows with retained placenta, particularly in the first 5 to 7 days postpartum. Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus spp., and occasionally Clostridium spp. are also present; the last can occasionally result in tetanus if C. tetani proliferates. High-throughput automated DNA pyrosequencing of uterine fluid from dairy cows with metritis on postpartum days 1 to 3 and 8 to 10 indicated that Fusobacterium and Bacteroides accounted for more than 83% of all bacterial DNA. 1 Slow-growing facultative anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (Helcococcus kunzii and H. ovis) have also been cultured from the uterine fluid in dairy cows with puerperal metritis. 2 The current view is that E. coli colonization within the first 3 days after parturition creates a suitable intrauterine environment that leads to puerperal metritis by facilitating the establishment and persistence of F. necrophorum and other gram-negative anaerobic bacteria in the endometrium and uterine lumen. Early intrauterine colonization with E. coli strains that carry the virulence factor fimH that facilitate adhesion to endometrial epithelial and stromal cells increases the odds of developing metritis by 4.6 to 4.7. 3 Clinical signs of puerperal metritis are most likely caused by intrauterine colonization with the strict anaerobic bacteria F. necrophorum and the facultative anaerobe T. pyogenes, which are the most likely source for the fetid odor of affected cattle. Another important virulence factor for developing metritis appears to be lktA (leukotoxin) of F. necrophorum. 3 Together, this sequential colonization pathway suggests that decreasing fecal contamination of the vagina and uterine lumen (and therefore the colonization by E. coli) in the immediate postpartum period should decrease the incidence of puerperal metritis in cattle. Interestingly, it appears that uterine colonization by E. coli in the early postpartum period increases the risk of puerperal metritis but decreases the risk of clinical endometritis, whereas uterine colonization by S. uberis in the early postpartum period increases the risk of clinical endometritis. 4",

The forceful removal of retained placenta, particularly in the first 4 days postpartum, is also considered to be a major predisposing factor to puerperal metritis. Recent work indicates that the fundamental cause of retained placenta is impaired neutrophil function, in which the ability of the maternal immune system to recognize the placenta as \"foreign\" tissue is impaired. Specifically, the separation of a placenta from healthy caruncles in a normal calving depends on incompatibility between maternal and fetal major histocompatibility complex Class I expressed on the epithelium within the fetomaternal unit. 5 In other words, retained placenta is an indication of an impaired immune system, which may be secondary to periparturient deficiency of vitamin E or selenium, or a greater degree of negative energy balance prepartum.

The optimal rectal temperature cut point indicating a cow has puerperal metritis during the first 10 days in milk in dairy cattle is approximately \u226539.5\u00b0C (range is >39.2\u00b0C to >39.7\u00b0C), with the cut point higher for primiparous than multiparous cattle. 6, 7 It has become popular on some large dairies to measure the rectal temperature each morning for the first 10 days of lactation, primarily as a screening test for puerperal metritis. One study suggested that rectal temperature measurement from day 5 to 10 of lactation was sufficient, because this protocol did not negatively impact the ability to successfully treat cases of puerperal metritis that are diagnosed before day 5 of lactation. 8 Although an elevated rectal temperature is considered a requirement for a diagnosis of puerperal metritis, it is important to recognize that some cows can have systemic signs of illness and a serosanguinous uterine discharge and a normal rectal temperature. An elevated rectal temperature in the 5 to 10 day postpartum period should not be used as the sole criteria for a diagnosis of clinical metritis, because this will lead to overtreatment of healthy cows. For example, 14% to 66% of healthy cattle exhibit at least one rectal temperature \u226539.5\u00b0C in the first 10 days of lactation, 59% of cows with clinical metritis maintain a rectal temperature <39.5\u00b0C, and rectal temperature is impacted by the age of the animal, environmental conditions, and the method used to measure rectal temperature. 9 The heart rate is usually elevated and may range from 96 to 120 beats/min. The respiratory rate is commonly increased to 60 to 72 breaths/min, and the breath sounds may be louder than normal. Rumen contractions may be markedly depressed or absent. A foul-smelling fluid diarrhea may occur. Mild to moderate dehydration is common because affected cows do not drink normally.",

Death can occur in untreated animals. Because of the mixed bacterial flora in the postpartum uterus with a retained placenta, broad-spectrum antimicrobials are recommended. Procaine penicillin (22,000 U/kg BW intramuscularly every 12-24 h) and ceftiofur (1-2.2 mg/kg BW intramuscularly every 24 h) for 3 to 5 days are preferred treatments, with some support from clinical trials for the administration of ampicillin (10-11 mg/kg BW intramuscularly) 14 or oxytetracycline (11 mg/kg BW intravenously every 24 h) for 3 to 5 days. Ceftiofur increases the cure rate and milk yield and decreases rectal temperature when administered to dairy cows with fever and vaginal discharge or dystocia. Subcutaneous administration of ceftiofur (1 mg/kg BW) achieves concentrations of ceftiofur derivatives in uterine tissue and lochial fluid that exceeded the reported minimal inhibitory concentrations for common metritis pathogens. Treatment with a longer acting formulation of ceftiofur (cefti ofur crystalline free acid) subcutaneously into the base of the ear at 6.6 mg/kg may not provide an adequate duration of antibiotic concentration in endometrial tissue and lochia in cows with puerperal metritis, and current data do not support using this one-dose ceftiofur treatment regimen instead of daily subcutaneous ceftiofur injections for 3 to 5 days. 15 A recent randomized clinical trial indicated that the administration of ceftiofur crystalline free acid (6.6 mg/kg) subcutaneously twice into the base of the ear on days 0 and 3 was effective in treating puerperal metritis, with the second dose given in the opposite ear. 16 Care should be exercised when injecting ceftiofur crystalline free acid subcutaneously into the base of the ear because acute death has been associated with neurologic sequelae caused by intraarterial injection. Ampicillin increased the pregnancy rate and decreased the cure rate, compared with ceftiofur, in cattle that were also treated with intrauterine ampicillin and cloxacillin. Generally, oxytetracycline use should be confined to the first 5 to 7 days postpartum when E. coli predominates, because it is likely to be ineffective against T. pyogenes in the endometrium. Oxytetracycline at 30 mg/kg BW intravenously as a single dose in cows with retained fetal membranes resulted in concentrations of the antimicrobial in uterine secretions, placenta, and cotyledon for 32 to 36 hours. Two intramuscular injections of regular formulations of oxytetracycline at 25 mg/kg BW resulted in lower peak concentrations, but these were maintained for 144 hours. Parenteral oxytetracycline appears to decrease endotoxin production, as indicated by the severity of leukopenia in cattle with retained placenta.",

These include prostaglandins, ergot derivatives, oxytocin, and \u03b2 2adrenoceptor antagonists. The rationale for their use is that they stimulate uterine contractions and physically aid in the expulsion of the fetal membranes. Generally, the consensus is that they are ineffective after the diagnosis of a retained placenta is recognized. However, their use may be effective if used immediately after calving. In particular, the frequent intramuscular administration of oxytocin appears to provide the most effective means of preventing metritis, with a recommended protocol of 20 IU every 3 hours for postpartum days 0 to 3, 30 IU every 2 hours for postpartum days 4 to 6, and 40 IU every 2 hours for postpartum days 7 to 10. A large study found that intramuscular injection of oxytocin (30 IU) immediately after parturition and 2 to 4 hours later decreased the incidence of retained placenta and the calving-to-conception interval. Fenprostalene at 1 mg subcutaneously, 25 mg dinoprost tromethamine intramuscularly, or 20 IU oxytocin given to a large number of dairy cows in five commercial dairy herds did not reduce the incidence of retained fetal membranes or improve reproductive performance. A detailed review failed to identify any evidence supporting the use of estrogen or prostaglandins in the first 7 to 10 days postpartum. 21 The finding that retained placenta can be caused by neutrophil dysfunction at calving provides the basis for epidemiologic evidence that deficiency of trace minerals or vitamins (such as selenium and vitamin E) is associated with an increased incidence of retained placenta.

In contrast, acute hemorrhage with loss of less than 10% of total blood volume (equivalent to an acute blood loss of less than 0.8% of BW) produces minimal detectable clinical changes. Traumatic injury or spontaneous rupture of a large blood vessel are common reasons for acute hemorrhage. Any sort of minor surgical wound, e.g., castration or dehorning, may lead to excess hemorrhage after which there is a hemorrhagic tendency caused by defects of clotting. Some of the more common causes of hemorrhagic shock are as follows. Hypovolemia also stimulates the release of antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin). There is contraction of the spleen and venous capacitance vessels, an increased peripheral vascular resistance, and an increase in heart rate in an attempt to maintain cardiac output and blood perfusion through the coronary and cerebral blood vessels. Water shifts from the interstitial space to the vascular space in response to the contraction of precapillary arterioles. In the initial stages of hypovolemic failure the primary signs are those of interstitial fluid depletion and dehydration, with dry mucous membranes, sunken eyes, and decreased skin turgor. Peripheral vasoconstriction in the face of continued hypovolemia and falling cardiac output results in the opening of arteriovenous shunts and decreased perfusion of organ systems, with resultant damage from hypoxia and tissue acidosis and the development of clinical signs of peripheral vascular failure and shock. Arterial blood pressure falls terminally, and a decrease in mean arterial pressure indicates a complete lack of cardiovascular reserve.

The other immediate concern is to replenish the blood volume and a decision must be made if this will be with fluids, whole blood, or stroma free hemoglobin solutions. Blood transfusion replaces all elements of the blood and in cases of severe hemorrhage blood transfusion is the most satisfactory treatment. However, a decision for blood transfusion should not be made lightly because the procedure is time-consuming, costly, and carries some risk. The decision to use whole blood in addition to fluids for treatment is based on the need to replace erythrocytes. The hematocrit can be a guide, in combination with clinical assessment, if the hemorrhage started at least 4 hours previously. With acute hemorrhage (<4 hours), transfusion is indicated solely on the basis of the severity of clinical signs. In the period immediately following hemorrhage a hematocrit of 20% is indicative of a significant loss of erythrocytes and the hematocrit should be monitored over the next 24 to 48 hours. If there is a fall to less than 12%, a transfusion of blood is indicated, but a stable packed cell volume (PCV) between 12% and 20% is not usually an indication for transfusion. The best anticoagulant for immediate blood transfusion is sodium citrate, which is widely available and inexpensive. Citrate complexes calcium and inhibits coagulation; as such the amount of sodium citrate mixed with a volume of blood must be accurately known because excess sodium citrate will induce hypocalcemia when collected blood is transfused into the recipient. Sodium citrate (purchased as a white powder) is dissolved in sterile water to provide a stock solution of 3.85% (weight/volume), which can be autoclaved; the stock solution is subsequently mixed at one part solution to nine parts blood. As an example, 500 mL of 3.85% stock sodium citrate solution is placed at the bottom of a glass bottle and 4.5 L of blood collected to provide a final blood volume of 5 L. Approximately 20 mL of blood for each kg BW can be safely collected from a healthy blood donor (equivalent to 10 L from a 500-kg horse or cow). Do not exceed this volume of collection from the donor, because 40 mL of blood for each kg BW can be lethal. Heparinized blood is not recommended for immediate transfusion because heparin has a much longer half-life in domestic animals than citrate; consequently, if hemorrhage is not controlled there is the potential for heparin to facilitate additional blood loss.",

In contrast, erythrocytes from adult domestic animals have a glucose concentration that is much lower than that in plasma and, consequently, a much lower rate of glucose metabolism, 4 potentially minimizing the need for additional glucose. Enthusiastic supporters of using ACD solution can purchase commercial plastic collection kits (usually 450 mL) with the appropriate volume of ACD solution present, but this becomes expensive when contemplating transfusion of an adult horse or cow. Alternatively, 3.6 mL of 50% dextrose solution, 1.6 g of sodium citrate, and 0.5 g citric acid can be dissolved in distilled water to a total volume of 50 mL, which is sufficient to collect 450 mL of blood.",

Formaldehyde treatment for hemostasis cannot be recommended for use in horses with the current available data. However, administration of a 5% solution of formalin to healthy goats (at 1.1 mL/kg intravenously) had a transient but detectable effect on decreasing both clotting time and bleeding time. This suggests that the effect of intravenous formalin on hemostasis may be dose dependent, and the optimal dose has yet to be identified in horses.

Animals receiving NSAIDs should be normally hydrated to minimize potential renal effects such as tubular nephrosis and papillary necrosis (see diseases of the kidney). Combined administration of a systemic NSAID with an intraarticular corticosteroid appeared to be more successful in the treatment of joint pain in horses than single treatment of either agent alone. 10 Although parturition is painful, current data do not support the routine administration of NSAIDs at parturition because most of the studies completed in cattle have reported an increased incidence of retained placenta in animals treated with NSAIDs; this result is consistent with the current understanding that PGF 2\u03b1 plays an important role in placental detachment. 11 Whether NSAIDs are beneficial in cattle experiencing dystocia remains to be determined. 12, 13 Flunixin Meglumine This NSAID has excellent antiinflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic properties, and is the preferred NSAID for acute soft tissue or visceral pain, although it is also efficacious against musculoskeletal pain. Flunixin meglumine provides excellent analgesia in equine colic and postoperative pain. In a comparison of three NSAIDs used to minimize postsurgical pain in horses, flunixin meglumine (1 mg/kg BW), phenylbutazone (4 mg/kg BW), or carprofen (0.7 mg/kg BW) were administered once intravenously. All three NSAIDs were effective in controlling postoperative pain, but the duration of clinical effect was longer for flunixin meglumine (12.8 hours) than carprofen (11.7 hours) or phenylbutazone (8.4 hours). Flunixin meglumine (1.1 mg/kg intravenously) was an effective analgesic in 2-to 3-monthold bull dairy calves undergoing surgical castration; flunixin meglumine administration attenuated the cortisol response and avoided some of the behavioral changes observed in calves castrated without drugs or with lidocaine infusion alone. 1 The usual loading dose for flunixin meglumine is 1.1 to 2.2 mg/kg BW IV (ruminants) or 1.1 mg/kg BW (horses) followed by a maintenance dose of 1.1 mg/kg BW every 24 hours, although some studies have administered repeated injections at 8 to 12 hours. Flunixin meglumine is usually administered once or twice a day for its analgesic effect and is usually administered parenterally (preferably intravenously because of the rare instances of myonecrosis following intramuscular injections, particularly in horses), although oral formulations exist. Intramuscular doses are rapidly absorbed, with the maximal concentration occurring within 1 hour. Large doses given to individual ponies may, however, be toxic. Toxic effects are similar to those with phenylbutazone and include ulceration of the colon, stomach, and mouth; the latter two are most evident when administered orally. The major disadvantage with flunixin meglumine is the relatively short duration of action and label requirements for intravenous injection in the United States. 14 ",

It is most effective for the relief of mild to moderate musculoskeletal pain. The half-life of the drug in plasma is about 3.5 hours so that repeated treatment is recommended. A plasma concentration of 20 \u00b5g/mL appears to be clinically effective in horses, whereas a plasma concentration of 60 to 90 \u00b5g/mL appears to be clinically effective in cattle. After oral use in horses the peak levels in plasma are reached at 2 hours, but after intramuscular injection this does not occur until after 6 hours; thus, the oral or intravenous routes are the usual routes of administration. Unless care is taken to inject the drug slowly when using the intravenous route, severe phlebitis, sometimes causing complete obstruction of the jugular vein, may result. For horses the recommended dose rate is 4.4 mg/kg BW daily for 5 days orally or intravenously. Treatment on day 1 may be at 4.4 mg/kg BW twice, constituting a loading dose. Treatment beyond 5 days may be continued at minimal effective dose rates. However, prolonged use, especially in ponies, at a dose of 10 to 12 mg/kg BW daily for 8 to 10 days, may be followed by ulceration of alimentary tract mucosa, including the oral mucosa, and fatal fluid retention caused by hypoproteinemia. The pathogenesis of these lesions is thought to be caused by a widespread phlebopathy. Phenylbutazone should not be used if there is preexisting gastrointestinal ulceration, clotting deficits, or cardiac or renal dysfunction. Its use should be under close veterinary supervision so that the dose rate may be kept to a minimal effective level and so that it is used only when there is a clear clinical indication to do so.

The effects of prolonged road transportation have been measured in young calves, cattle, sheep, and horses. \u2022 Climate, especially temperature, either as excessive heat or cold, is a stressor. In particular, a change of climate places great pressure on heat production and conservation mechanisms in, for example, conditions of sudden wind and rain, which affect the comfort of animals. \u2022 Excessive physical effort, as in endurance rides for horses, struggling in restrained animals, fear, and the excitement and fear in capture myopathy syndrome in wildlife, are all potential stressors. \u2022 Pain, especially analgesia-masked pain in severe colic in horses, is a stressor. The pain of dehorning and castration of farm animals is also a transient stressor, depending on the species and method used. \u2022 Crowding factors, such as temperature, humidity, the physical exhaustion associated with standing up for long periods, being walked on, difficulty in getting to food and water, and so forth, are relevant. Two other factors could be important. One is the effect of crowding on behavior; for example, pigs in overcrowded pens appear to bite one another more than when they are housed at lower densities, and are more restless than normal when temperatures in the pens are high. The biting is much more severe between males than between females. Also, it is known that pigs bite each other when establishing precedence in a group, e.g., after mixing of batches, and that this is more severe when feed is short. The other possible factor that might affect the animal's response to crowding is a psychological appreciation of the unattractiveness of crowding (or of isolation).

Probably the most serviceable guideline is \"stress is any stimulus, internal or external, chemical or physical or emotional, that excites neurons of the hypothalamus to release corticotrophinreleasing hormone at rates greater than would occur at that time of the day in the absence of the stimulus. \" This definition uses stress where stressor would have been more commonly used.

This was the basis of the original \"stress and the general adaptation syndrome\" as set down by Selye in 1950. The original concept is still attractive because of its simplicity and logic. However, evidence supporting the hypothesis remains limited. The importance of the concept for our animals is unproven.

Transportation of calves, 4 to 6 months of age, for only 4 hours results in a leukocytosis with neutrophilia, a decrease in T-lymphocyte population, a suppression of lymphocyte blastogenesis, and enhancement of neutrophil activity. The effect of road transportation on cattle varies according to age: the transportation of 1-to 3-week-old calves for up to 18 hours was not as stressful as in older calves. The lack of response of the younger calves to transport may be caused by their lack of physiologic adaptation to coping with the transportation.

In the biological functioning framework, animals use a variety of behaviors and physiologic responses to cope with the environment; poor production or injury occurs in severe circumstances in which they are unable to adapt to the environment. This framework has been criticized because it does not include an emotional component, although such activation may be inferred by evaluating the magnitude of sympathoadrenal medullary and HPA axes. In the affective state framework, animal welfare is viewed as the \"net sum of the magnitude of pleasant and unpleasant experiences. \" Although this is a useful concept, it has been difficult to quantify. Finally, the natural living framework is based on the concept that welfare is improved whenever animals can express their normal behaviors; this is best illustrated by \"welfare-friendly\" production systems, such as free range grazing of sheep flocks and beef cattle herds. When practiced to extremes, natural living can result in animal welfare concerns, such as increased neonatal losses caused by hypothermia in ruminants exposed to cold and windy weather.",

The animals are examined and corrective action is taken, including possession of the animals and relocating them to a commercial feeding facility. Predicting survival of starved animals is a major challenge. Economics becomes an important aspect because the financial costs of stabilizing a group of starved horses may exceed their free market price. Responsible management of chronically starved commercial animals should include options for immediate euthanasia. Ethical considerations include deciding if certain severely starved animals should be euthanized.

Normal animals have a percent fat of 70% to 80% in femur bone marrow; animals dying of starvation usually have a bone marrow percent fat <10% and very low body condition score. 6 Serous atrophy can also be quantified by magnetic resonance imaging of bone marrow fat in the distal limbs, 7 but this appears to provide a complicated and expensive method compared with weighing to constant weight.

At necropsy there is a marked reduction in muscle mass, lack of depot fat, and serious atrophy of fat. Starvation may also occur in beef calves sucking poorly nourished heifer dams with an insufficient supply of milk. The mortality will be high during cold weather when the maintenance requirements are increased. Affected calves will initially suck vigorously and persistently, they will attempt to eat dry feed, drink surface water and urine, and bawl for several hours. Eventually they lie in sternal recumbency with their head and neck turned into their flanks and die quietly. The response to therapy is usually unsatisfactory and the case fatality rate is high. The convalescence period in survivors is prolonged and treatment is usually uneconomic. Affected animals must be brought indoors and kept warm and well bedded during treatment and realimentation. Initially, fluid therapy using balanced electrolyte solutions containing glucose and amino acids may be necessary to restore the animal's strength and appetite. This is followed by the provision of controlled amounts of a highly palatable digestible diet. High-quality legume hay is excellent, small amounts of ground grain are of value, and the daily administration of a multiple B vitamin and mineral mixture will replenish those lost during inanition.

In the absence of any primary disease, an animal or group of animals that presents with this as the problem is a major diagnostic dilemma. Several poorly identified diseases in this category are weaner ill-thrift, thin sow syndrome, thin ewe syndrome, and weak calf syndrome (see other sections of this chapter). Body weight and BCS are sometimes used interchangeably and regarded as synonymous. This is incorrect as body weight, per se, is not a good indicator of BCS because it is closely related to the height and girth of the animal and provides only limited information about body composition. 1 Body weight (live weight) reflects changes in protein and in fat but is influenced by the relative percentages of protein, fat, and water in the body, which can vary depending on physiologic status. Body weight is not a good indicator of energy content per kilogram of body weight, and proportions of fat, protein, and water are highly variable in animals of the same weight. 2 For example, when body mass is depleted there can be selective depletion of fat mass with partial replacement by water so that the amount of mobilized fat can be larger than the loss of body weight. [1] [2] [3] Additionally, body weight is substantially influenced by gut fill, and short periods of feed or water withholding, or feed supplementation, can result in marked changes in body weight without similar changes in body energy content. 2, 4 Pregnancy can increase body weight, especially during mid to late gestation, solely because of the growing fetus.",

These variables, and in particular fat mass, are closely associated with nutrient requirements, reproductive efficiency, cull value, and risk of disease (for example, laminitis in fat horses) of animal, and estimation of body fat from the BCS or back fat thickness is increasingly important in management of animals. 1, 2, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] The ideal body condition of an animal must be determined while considering many factors including species, sex, age, reproductive status, lactation status, disease risk, and intended use. For example, the ideal body condition of dairy cows during each stage of lactation is that which optimizes milk production, minimizes reproductive and health disorders, and maximizes economic returns. 2, 8 Body condition score is determined subjectively by observers using a standardized grading system. These grading systems were not developed to assess the fat content (proportion) of the animal but rather to assess \"flesh\" or the general body condition and are limited because of their subjective nature. 10 Additionally, body condition scoring systems do not provide an assessment of regional adiposity, which might have greater clinical relevance in some species, including horses. 5 Body condition scoring systems have not been validated in all major breeds and uses of animals (validation determines the relationship between BCS and a gold standard measure of body fat, such as deuterium dilution space or carcass analysis) nor has their reliability (intrarater and interrater agreement/repeatability expressed as an intraclass correlation coefficient or, less optimally, a \u03ba or weighted \u03ba statistic) been demonstrated over large numbers of raters. There are reports of an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.74 for four raters of 21 mares and 75 ponies, and of 0.92 (without details). 11, 12 Interrater agreement (weighted \u03ba statistic) among three trained observers for dairy cattle was 0.67 for exact agreement, 0.82 for \u00b1 0.25, and 0.96 for \u00b1 0.5 BCS, based on a <2 to 5 scale. 13 Training of observers markedly improved both interobserver and intraobserver repeatability. 13 Furthermore, differing rating systems might be used within an industry or between countries such as the use of different body condition scoring methodologies in the United Kingdom (UKBCS) and the United States (USBCS) resulting in the need to develop conversion factors (R 2 = 0.56): 14 USBCS = 1.182 + 0.816 \u00d7 UKBCS and, UKBCS = 0.131 + 0.681 \u00d7 USBCS.",

A nutritional deficiency of cobalt does cause weight loss in ruminants but is likely to have an area effect rather than cause weight loss in single animals. Copper, salt, zinc, potassium, selenium, phosphorus, calcium, and vitamin D deficiencies are also in this category. Experimental nutritional deficiencies of riboflavin, nicotinic acid, pyridoxine, and pantothenic acid in calves and pigs can also be characterized by ill-thrift. \u2022 Inadequate intake of an adequate supply of feed is dealt with under diseases of the mouth and pharynx and is not repeated here, but it is emphasized that the first place for a clinician to look in a thin animal is its mouth. The owner might have forgotten just how old the animal is and one often finds a cow without any incisor teeth attempting to survive on pasture. \u2022 Other factors that reduce an animal's food intake when it is available in adequate amounts include anxiety, the excitement of estrus, new surroundings, loss of a newborn, bad weather, tick or other insect worry, and abomasal displacement.",

For this reason, they are not set down here and neither is the degree of shortfall from the target that is acceptable, which depends heavily on the risk aversion or acceptability in the industry in that country. For example, if the enterprise is heavily capitalized by high-cost housing and land, the standard of performance would be expected to be higher than in a more exploitative situation in which cattle are pastured all year.

A target for a weaning weight of at least 22 kg for Merinos, or 45% of mature weight, is commonly used. 2-4 \u2022 Merino ewes often have poor milk production, hence management of the ewe flock, such as maintaining ewes at target condition scores from mating and throughout pregnancy, is critical to achieve target weaning weights. 4 \u2022 Postweaning growth rate: Increasing growth from 10 to 20 g/day reduces the risk of mortality by 70% 3 and a target for growth in the immediate postweaning period of 30g/day (1 kg/ month) is sufficient to significantly reduce the risk of mortality. 2,4 \u2022 Other management factors likely to lead to low weaning weights and subsequent unthriftiness are extended mating periods (lambs born late in the season), ewes in low condition score (light lambs and poor milk supply), and multiple birth lambs. Weaner ill-thrift does occur in breeds other than the Merino 1 and is also reported in the Northern Hemisphere. The economic effects can be disastrous for individual flocks and have been estimated at up to USD$58M over the entire industry in Australia. 5 Decreased growth and delayed maturation can mean a poor performance at the first (maiden) lambing. A high proportion of weaner deaths in wool flocks reduces the ability to select replacement ewes, decreasing the rate of genetic gain (although ram genetics are overwhelmingly more important in a wool flock). There is also a substantial decrease in the amount and quality of weaner wool which, in Merino flocks, is usually the finest and most valuable from any age group.",

Increases in metabolic rate can be supported by anaerobic metabolism through the use of intramuscular ATP stores and conversion of glycogen or glucose to lactate for short periods of time. Ultimately, however, all energy is derived by aerobic metabolism and is limited by the rate of delivery of oxygen to tissue and its utilization in mitochondria. To support the increased energy expenditure required to perform work, such as racing, carrying a rider, or pulling a cart, the metabolic rate is increased. Increases in metabolic rate are supported by increases in oxygen delivery to tissue and carbon dioxide removal. Increased oxygen consumption is dependent on an increase in oxygen delivery to tissues, which is possible by increases in cardiac output, muscle blood flow and, in horses, an increase in hemoglobin concentration with a concomitant increase in the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood. The increased transport of oxygen from the air to the blood is accomplished principally by increases in respiratory rate and tidal volume. Factors that affect oxygen transport from the air to the mitochondria have the potential to impair performance. For instance, laryngeal hemiplegia reduces minute ventilation and exacerbates the normal exercise-associated hypoxemia in horses, atrial fibrillation decreases cardiac output and hence oxygen delivery to tissues, and anemia reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.",

Approximately 11 L of sweat are lost each hour during submaximal exercise, and this loss causes a significant decline in total body water, sodium, potassium, and chloride content and serum concentrations of these ions. Loss of chloride causes a metabolic alkalosis. Hypovolemia impairs thermoregulation by reducing blood flow to the skin and probably results in a reduction in gastrointestinal blood flow contributing to intestinal ischemia and development of ileus. Body temperature increases to dangerous levels (43\u00b0C; 109\u00b0F), and the horse cannot continue to exercise. Excessive increases in body temperature can overwhelm mechanisms to ensure that the brain of horses does not overheat, resulting in signs of CNS dysfunction. 1 If the exerciseinduced abnormalities are sufficiently severe then the combination of hyperthermia and dehydration can initiate a cascade of events terminating in shock, multiple organ failure, and death.",

Such examinations in the past had to be conducted on a treadmill if dynamic endoscopic examinations or electrocardiographic examinations were to be performed, but this is no longer the case. Endoscopic and electrocardiographic examinations of horses exercising in the field, and ideally undertaking exercise tasks that mimic their day-to-day activities and competition, are now readily achieved in real time. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Dynamic endoscopy allows visualization of the upper airway of horses under actual working conditions (racing, dressage, and reining) and avoids the risks and limitations of horses exercising on a treadmill, 3, 7, 9 although this risk is comparatively small with 0.6% of horses sustaining an important injury during examination. 10 Examination of ridden horses under saddle also provides the opportunity to examine the horse-saddle-rider interaction, including saddle fit and girth tension, which is an important cause of poor performance in some classes of equitation. 11 Values of a number of performancerelated variables have been determined for Standardbred and Thoroughbred racehorses, with better athletes having greater aerobic capacity. However, at this time the main use of high-speed exercise testing is the detection of exercise-induced arrhythmia (such as paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation), rhabdomyolysis, and upper airway obstruction. Upper airway obstruction is a common cause of poor performance that can often be diagnosed by rhinolaryngoscopic examination of horses at rest or after brief nasal occlusion. However, some causes of obstruction are best diagnosed using rhinolaryngoscopy during exercise. 12",

Ground currents (step potentials or step voltages) occur with each strike and are the most common mechanism in four-legged species because after injection of current into the earth, a potential gradient develops that can initiate current entering the animal from one set of feet, leaving the body by the other set of feet. In contrast to humans, this current crosses essential organs, such as the heart and liver, causing death. 4. Contact, from touching long conductors, such as railings, cables, and fences can be fatal. 5 . Upward leaders that emanate from high ground and tall objects when downward leaders approach ground During lightning strike trees, fences, barns, and pools of water may become electrified, and it is not unusual for damp ground to act as a conductor for electricity passing along the roots of stricken trees. Animals electrocuted by standing on electrified earth are unlikely to show burn marks on the body. Oak trees are particularly prone to lightning strike and because of their spreading foliage and extensive root system, are common mediators of electrocution deaths in pastured animals.

With high-voltage currents and good earth contacts such as wet concrete floors, water, and damp earth, the animal may fall dead without a struggle. Singeing and burning are likely to occur because of the severity of the shock. The burns may be localized to the muzzle or feet and be in the form of radial deposits of carbon with or without disruption of tissue, or they may appear as treelike, branching patterns of singeing running down the trunk and limbs. Acute blindness linked to lightning flash injury has occurred in a horse. The injuries were consistent with acute and severe flash injury. 4 In less severe shocks, the animal falls unconscious, suddenly collapses, or may struggle, followed by a period of unconsciousness varying from several minutes to several hours. When consciousness is regained, or the animal is removed from the electric field, the animal may rise and be perfectly normal, or show depression, blindness, ataxia, posterior paralysis, monoplegia, and cutaneous hyperesthesia. In some cases there may be more local signs including nystagmus and unilateral paralysis. Sloughing of the skin at the sites of burns may occur after a few days. These signs may persist or disappear gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks. With electrocution in pigs caused either by lightning strike or wiring faults, the major signs are related to spinal injury or to fracture of the ileum, ischium, and the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae with a large number of animals exhibiting apparent lameness and especially posterior paralysis.

Gastrointestinal disease results when the radiation dose ranges between 10 and 80 Gy and results from damage to the rapidly dividing undifferentiated cells in crypts of intestinal villi, which are the progenitor cells to the differentiated enterocytes of the intestinal villi. Damage to bone marrow stem cells is the main cause of death at whole-body doses between 2 and 10 Gy with death in large animals occurring 6 to 8 weeks after exposure. Clinical disease is slow in development after exposure because the effect of this damage is not evident until the death of existing circulating blood cells.

However, for some disorders environmental agents (teratogens) may cause similar morphologic anomalies, e.g., arthrogryposis, so care should be taken. Pedigree analysis may help if there are sufficient animals of known breeding to show that the incidence of the disorder follows a Mendelian pattern. However, in many herds/flocks animals may be closely related and pedigree analysis can sometimes be misleading and produce a fictitious relationship between inheritance and disease. As the biochemical anomaly is now known for many diseases, or perhaps can be deduced from histopathologic lesions, laboratory tests may confirm a presumptive diagnosis. Test mating of a sire to daughters, related females, or females that have given birth to an affected animal is the ultimate confirmation of the genetic nature of a disorder, provided the appropriate numbers of progeny are generated. Disproving a genetic cause of a disorder may be as important as proving it. Matings of a sire to produce a minimum of 24 progeny from his daughters or 12 from putative heterozygotes (females that have given birth to affected individuals) are usually considered satisfactory numbers to exclude a likely inherited cause if no affected individuals are born (P < 0.5). The birth of a proportion of affected offspring is strong evidence of inheritance.",

Control may be at an individual herd/flock level or applied to all at risk. It is best instigated with the help of breed societies who may exert control over the fate of animals diagnosed as heterozygous through control of registrations.

There are over 2000 species of cyanobacteria with at least 80 known to be toxigenic. 1 The cyanobacteria, commonly referred to as blue-green algae, form dense blooms in fresh or brackish bodies of warm, stagnant water. Ingestion of cyanobacteria or their toxins liberated from ruptured cells results in clinical signs. Toxicity is species specific and some species, such as Anabaena flos-aquae, produce more than one toxin. Cyanotoxins associated with large-animal poisonings include: 1-3 \u2022 Microcystins. These are potent hepatotoxins produced by many different cyanobacteria including several species of Anabaena, Anabaenopsis, Microcystis, Planktothrix, Nostoc, and Oscillatoria. \u2022 Anatoxins. Toxins in this group are potent neurotoxins produced primarily by several species of Anabaena and a few species of Planktothrix. \u2022 Various freshwater toxins. Included in this group are cyanotoxins known to cause toxicity in animals. Toxins, produced by a variety of cyanobacteria, include saxitoxins, cylindrospermopsin, nodularins, and most recently \u03b2-Nmethylamino-l-alanine (BMAA). 4,5OccurrenceCyanobacterial toxins are associated with outbreaks of poisoning in farm animals that drink contaminated water. Lakes, reservoirs, ponds, waterholes, and other nonturbulent water sources are all affected, especially when the organisms are concentrated by onshore winds so that large quantities may be ingested. Typically the surface of the water has a bluish green sheen or pea green to iridescent neon green streaks. Often the algae accumulate along the shoreline where animals have easy access and the water is shallow and more stagnant. In small waterholes and reservoirs the surface water is often completely covered with a very thick coat of gelatinous organisms (algae bloom), and animals are unable to drink without ingesting some of the algae. Cyanobacteria are found in every continent except Antarctica and toxicoses has been recorded in most SYNOPSIS Etiology Toxins from cyanobacteria in blooms on stagnant fresh or brackish water in lakes, ponds, reservoir, billabongsEpidemiology Outbreaks with high mortality when sole source of drinking water is polluted by toxigenic algae Diagnosis confirmation Positive identification of toxin(s) in water source and animal fluids or tissue confirms diagnosis; liquid chromatography mass spectrometry using animal tissue available for some toxins (microcystins)",

Animals, particularly sheep, mill about excessively and some die of suffocation or misadventure, including drowning.The immediate effect of the fallout is to blanket pastures with ash, and in heavy fallout areas taller succulents may become lodged and unavailable for grazing. 2 Livestock may be forced to graze more robust, but toxic, plant species if stored feeds are not provided, and loss from plant poisoning was observed following the Mount St. Helens eruption. Hypocalcemia, apparently resulting from food deprivation, was also observed in the immediate postfallout period with Mount St. Helens and was also recorded following the Mount Hecla eruption.Ash fallout may have a devastating effect on insect life, and this may be followed soon afterward by death from starvation of insectivorous avian species.

During the airborne stage, wind sorting of the dust into particles of varying size, shape, and density results in area variation in the composition of the fallout. Consequently, area variations in chemical analysis over the fallout area can occur. Analyses based on acid-leachable or water-soluble analysis are more relevant to immediate animal health than those reporting total content.Death resulted from acute fluorine poisoning in association with high fluoride levels in ash and ash-contaminated grasses and water in the period immediately following the Mount Hecla, Lonquimay, and other eruptions. 4, 5 It is therefore advisable to remove livestock from ash-contaminated pastures until this hazard is determined.

Volcanic ash may also contain variable amounts of free crystalline silica such as quartz, cristobalite, and tridymite which, if present in respirable-sized particles for prolonged exposure periods, can induce pulmonary fibrosis.Silicosis is primarily a human health concern, although spontaneous silicosis is recorded in livestock. While it is a concern with all eruptions, the long-term health history of animals and man following volcanic eruptions suggests this hazard is minimal.In the vicinity of Mount St. Helens there have been two appreciable effects on livestock health: \u2022 There has been a marked increase in the incidence of hypomagnesemia in cattle in the semiarid channeled scab lands of central Washington. This has possibly resulted from the reflective nature of the ash layer on the soil reducing soil temperature increase during early grass growth and thus reducing magnesium uptake. Grass magnesium concentrations are low and potassium levels are high, but there are no preeruption values for comparison. \u2022 There has been an increase in the severity of selenium deficiency. The association between selenium deficiency and recent volcanic origin soils is well recognized. Problems have been corrected by additional and more intensive selenium supplementation. Animals might ingest considerable quantities of ash from grazing contaminated pastures or from hay subsequently prepared from these areas. There is little field evidence for disturbance of digestive function in livestock following the Mount St. Helens or Mount Ruapehu eruptions, and feeding trials of ash to cattle and sheep have shown no clinical or postmortem evidence of untoward effects or any depression of production except that associated with decreased feed palatability at high ash feed levels. There is evidence that long-term inhalation of volcanic gases exacerbates the lesions caused by lung worm infestation in sheep in Hawaii. 6",

They are often poorly equipped to deal with animal problems, yet assume authority over their fate in the temporary absence of the owners. The normal reaction of the average person is to judge that burn injuries are much more serious than in fact they are, hence many burned animals are often unnecessarily destroyed. \u2022 Facilities for penning and treating burned animals will often have been partially or completely destroyed by the fire, so mustering to inspect the affected animals may need improvised or temporary yards. \u2022 The presence and amount of insurance also exerts an influence on the owner's decision on the course to be followed. If most livestock are protected by fire insurance there will be no argument with a veterinarian's decision that severely burned animals should be immediately destroyed for humane reasons. \u2022 Salvage for slaughter is often difficult to arrange at short notice for such large numbers and often has logistical problems in the form of burned yards and fencing. Public sentiment is also often against this practice, and the quality of meat from burned animals can be severely downgraded. However, subsequent slaughter must be kept in mind as an option for animals that will have impaired functions because of burns, such as ewes and cows with teat injuries and rams and bulls with preputial and scrotal burns.",

Burns to the prepuce of wethers and rams may induce urethral obstruction. This will usually not be apparent until some days later; thus reinspection of groups assessed as not needing immediate destruction should always be a priority.Separation of the coronary band from the hoof is commonly seen after burns from grass fires. There is usually a serous exudate at the separation of the hoof and coronet, which can become struck by blowflies. Footbathing in appropriate insecticides, which may be an off-label use, can effectively prevent or treat strikes.

            "text": "Genetic disorders are a small but important cause of wastage in farmed animals and, with increasing access to genomic analysis and technology, are more readily recognized and categorized. Most occur in purebred animals and the simplest to understand and control are inherited as autosomal recessive traits with a clear phenotype and expression in the young animal. The recessive mode of inheritance means that heterozygotes can, in the absence of available testing, remain in the population, with disease only occurring when homozygous-affected animals are produced as a result of mating of heterozygous parents. An example of this situation is that of severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome in Arabian foals. Dominant disorders tend to be selflimiting because of lack of viability of affected offspring or because affected animals are readily identified and excluded from the breeding pool.A more complex situation is when heterozygotic animals have characteristics that are desired and when the homozygotic animal is severely or lethally affected. In this situation there is an imperative to select for the mutation by breeding desired heterozygotes. An example is Quarter Horses with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (see Chapter 15) in which the heterozygote is favored because it performs better in halter class competitions. Another example is in the original Dexter cattle in which the slightly dwarfed Dexter phenotype is dominant to the normal and is selected for. Animals homozygous for the gene abort with a nonviable \"bulldog\" type fetus. Sex-linked disorders may occur but are uncommon. Some monogenic disorders may arise de novo because of new mutations of germ plasm. Those with a dominant mode of inheritance are present in offspring of the animal in question, usually affecting genes for structural proteins such as collagen. A new mutation should be considered with disorders such as osteogenesis imperfecta or skin fragility. The proportion of offspring with the defect may vary depending on what stage of gametogenesis the mutation occurred.Inbreeding, knowingly or unknowingly practiced, is an important feature in the manifestation of most outbreaks of a recessive disorder. Founder effect is an aspect of this that has been important when new breeds have been introduced to a country by importation of genetic material from a small number of individuals. Artificial breeding on a large and international scale has sometimes exacerbated this, particularly in cattle but also in horses.Genetic disorders can be manifested as disease or bodily malformation. When diagnosed, an entity may reflect the tip of an iceberg only, and it can be expected that many other cases go undiagnosed. Spread across an industry their economic importance may be limited, but as particular disorders tend to be concentrated in certain herds/flocks they may have considerable importance to an individual breeder, particularly those involved with pedigree breeding.
