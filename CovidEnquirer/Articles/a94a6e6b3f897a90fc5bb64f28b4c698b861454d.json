The primary aim was to determine the feasibility of fortnightly parent collected swabs in young children with CF. Methods: Children under three years with CF were recruited. Nasal swabs were collected by parents every fortnight and during periods of symptoms over 12 months. Nasal swabs were posted and virus detected using real-time PCR. Results: Only 27% of the patients completed the study to 10 months, although 98% of the swabs returned were adequate for analysis. Mould was observed growing on 23% of the returned swabs. There was no evidence to demonstrate relationships with symptoms and viruses, prolonged symptoms, prolonged shedding or patterns of virus infections. Conclusions: This study highlights the need to further investigate the role of viruses in children with CF using a robust method of frequent collection in children for a longitudinal study, with appropriate storage and shipping techniques to avoid mould growth or other potential contaminants.",

However, we would recommend that parents store swabs in the home freezer and return either by courier on ice, or deliver the swabs to the site using cold-blocks and insulated bag to limit mould contamination.

Firstly, it is important that a single researcher establishes a good relationship with the parent and the family. This helps the family to feel that they have a support person they can contact during the study. Web-based diaries that could be filled out by parents, or depending on the budget of the project personal electronic diaries, have been shown to improve diary card completion [15, 16] . While reply-paid envelopes that could be posted in standard Australia Post letterboxes were considered the most efficient and cost-effective way of posting swabs, perhaps if parents froze the nasal swabs and then a courier service collected them it may help to improve compliance.

            "text": "Rhinovirus was the most commonly detected virus in this study, at a mean prevalence of 14% in the cross-sectional cohort, varying between 7 and 41% due to season. Similar rates have been observed in previous studies which range from a mean prevalence of 8% in infants [19] to between 7 and 27% in children [6, 7] and up to 84% in adults [3] with cystic fibrosis. Prevalence of other viruses reported in the present study varied compared to other studies in cystic fibrosis. Prevalence of coronavirus was similar, although slightly higher in the present study at 3% compared to others between 0 and 1.5% [6, 20] . Prevalence of parainfluenzae was less in the present study at 1% compared to up to 17% in other studies [2, 3, 19, 20] . As expected rates of RSV were lower in this study at 1% compared to infant studies which reported a prevalence of 23% [2, 3, 6, 19, 20] . No influenza was detected in the cross-sectional group in the present study, although studies have reported varied rates between 1.5 and 30% [2, 3, 6, 19] . The prevalence of adenovirus was similar to another study in adults, although less than others in children [2, 3, 20] . Differences in the prevalence of virus between studies can be explained by a number of factors: age of children (e.g. RSV is more common in infants), time of year when samples were taken (e.g. more influenza in winter), if samples were taken at time of an exacerbation or when the participants were well or symptom free, and if nasal/throat swabs or bronchoalveolar lavage or nasopharyngeal aspirate was used.",
