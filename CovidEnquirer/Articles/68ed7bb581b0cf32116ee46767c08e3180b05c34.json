Antibiotic treatment was used to prevent secondary infections since these patients were critically ill. Antiviral regimes were also used in most patients which we hoped may have roles but still need more data. However, there were no specific remedies for SARS-CoV-2 yet 11, 12 . Therefore, most patients were treated with supportive treatment and intensive care. Unfortunately, due to restrictions of hospital's conditions and the heavy burden of COVID-19 in Wuhan City, neither were we able to provide patients in need with advanced life support systems like Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO), nor were able to transport all serious patients to superior hospital for better medical treatments in time.

To help patients who were critically ill survive from SARS-CoV-2 infection, advanced life support systems and other more intensive care are needed. In our cohort, non-survivors were hospitalized at 10 days after onset, and most of patients develop into ARDS within the first 3 days after admission (Supplementary Figure 1). This concentratedly reflected the current situation under the outbreak and was closely related to the run-up of medical resources. Early detection and intervention of patients are especially important which can delay the development from mild to severe cases. Encouragingly, more intensive care units (ICU) are being constructed, and more specialists and clinicians from different regions in China are assembling in medical institutions in Wuhan.
