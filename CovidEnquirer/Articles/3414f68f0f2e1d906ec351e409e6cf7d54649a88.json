Fields Both host defense and viral genetic factors influence the development of viral infection and disease. Due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier, infection of the central nervous system creates additional complexities in interactions between a virus and its host. Stages in viral pathogenesis defined as (1) virus entry, (2) spread, (3) tropism, (4) virulence and injury to the host, and (5) the outcome of infection are discussed for viral infections in general and those aspects unique to infections of the central nervous system . Information about neuronal physiology and function has also been revealed through studying virus infection . An increased understanding of viral pathogenetic mechanisms and host response to infection raises interesting possibilities for vaccine development and for basic studies in neurology and neurobiology .",

            "text": "Key words : virus / infection / pathogenesis / central nervous system VIRAL PATHOGENESIS has been defined as the process by which a virus causes disease in a susceptible host .' Several stages in pathogenesis can be identified that represent unifying themes in this process . All viruses must successfully penetrate the host's barriers to entry, undergo primary replication and then spread to their ultimate target tissue . Any virus able to cause disseminated infection has the potential to infect the CNS . Viruses infecting the CNS can either circumvent the blood-brain barrier by entry into peripheral nerve endings and axonal transport into the CNS, or they can invade from the blood stream by infection of or transport across the vascular endothelium in the CNS, in regions of greater permeability, or by passive transport in infected monocytes . But with all potentially neurotropic viruses successful invasion of the CNS is rare, limited by host defenses, the mechanics of the blood-brain From the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, and the Shipley Institute of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, 25 activity and are thought to gain entry through small immune host defenses . breaks in the integrity of the mucosa, or possibly by uptake at the intact mucosal surface . Infection of the conjunctiva, presumably by direct inoculation from contaminated fingers, can occur with enterovirus 70, HSV and some coxsackie viruses . 3 Regardless of the route of entry, viruses must evade local phagocytic cells that make an important contribution to early host defense . Alveolar macrophages and histiocytes of the reticuloendothelial system efficiently phagocytose and eliminate invading viruses, but some (lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, cytomegalovirus and the lentiviruses visna and HIV) escape destruction by productively infecting these cells . 1,2,5 Elements of the host immune system, immunoglobulin A in mucous secretions and intraepithelial lymphocytes in the intestine, must also Spread Tissue invasion A period of replication in epithelial or subepithelial tissue at the site of inoculation typically occurs, except when virus is directly inoculated into the blood . Whether a virus infection will remain localized at the site of entry or become disseminated is influenced by the temperature of the epithelial surface (e .g . rhinovirus), the propensity of a virus to bud from the apical (influenza) or basolateral (HSV) surface of epithelial cells, 3 Following replication at the site of inoculation, virus enters the subepithelial lymphatic capillaries and is carried into the blood stream 3 where it must survive encounters with phagocytic cells and elements of the immune system . Primary viremia permits the rapid dissemination either of free virus or of bloodcell associated virus to other susceptible tissues :' successful penetration of the vascular endothelium and replication in these organs amplifies the infection and augments viremia . Viremia must be of a magnitude and duration adequate to sustain infection and, for some viruses, to permit an assault on the blood-brain barrier . Replication of some arboviruses in cerebral capillary endothelium precedes viral invasion of the neural parenchyma, 6 and replication in or passive transport across the endothelium has been postulated for several other viruses, including enteroviruses, arboviruses and retroviruses .6' 7 Because of its fenestrated endothelium and sparse basement membrane, the choroid plexus is also a target for replication or passive transport of mumps and arboviruses ; 1,3 through it, virus enters the cerebral spinal fluid to infect ependymal cells lining the ventricles and subseqently the underlying brain tissue . 3,5 Migrating infected monocytes, lymphocytes or leukocytes may be an important vehicle for virus transport into the CNS, especially in lentivirus infection (see Zink and Narayan, this issue,$ and refs 9,10) .",

HSV, rabies, poliovirus and reovirus are known to spread along nerves by the system of fast axonal transport .\" Transport has been demonstrated both towards and away from the cell body in somatic motor, somatic sensory and autonomic nerves, under various experimental conditions . Bidirectional transport is important in the establishment of, and reactivation from, latency seen with HSV and varicella zoster . 12,13 Viruses may have a predilection for a subset of nerve types, as evidenced by the more rapid uptake of reoviruses in motor than sensory fibers innervating the footpad 14 and by the restriction of rabies mutants to transport by sensory but not autonomic paths . 15 In contrast to the fast axonal transport of most viruses, the scrapie agent has been postulated to use the system of slow axonal transport . 3,6,16 Disruption of the neurofilament cytoskeleton that supports slow axonal transport has been observed in scrapie-infected neurons and has been implicated in generation of the spongiform changes that characterize this degenerative neurological disease (see Hope, this issue, 17 and refs 16, 18) . Viral replication occurs once virus particles reach the neuronal cell body. Newly synthesized virion components and virus particles then accumulate at post-synaptic sites, probably reflecting directed transport of virus components analogous to directed budding in polarized epithelial cells (see Entry into the host, above ; ref 11) . Both rabies and vesicular stomatitis virus accumulate at synaptic terminals and beneath the nodes of Ranvier . When antiviral antibody is added to infected neuronal cultures, vesicular stomatitis virus buds preferentially from the synapses, indicating that exocytosis by neurons may be facilitated at this point .3 Neurons thus transfer virus at synaptic junctions in the periphery . In the CNS, the high density of neurons and glia permits many viruses to spread from cell to cell with less fidelity .",

            "text": "Although each virus has evolved its own genetic determinants of virulence, some generalizations can be drawn . Outer capsid and envelope glycoproteins are frequently implicated as virulence factors because changes in their amino-acid sequence usually weaken their infectivity (attenuation), although this may be a subtle reflection of altered tropism . Genetic reassortants between virulent and avirulent strains of bunyaviruses and reoviruses have also been used to identify determinants of neurovirulence by segregation of phenotype with a particular viral gene . 3 Genetic recombination between strains of poliovirus and of HSV have similarly been used to identify genes critical for neurovirulence . 5 More than one region of a viral protein identified as a virulence factor may be important3 and, when neurotropism and neurovirulence are determined by the same protein, changes in that protein can have multiple and dramatic effects on the resulting infection . In studies of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus, a model of human demyelinating disease (see Nash, this issue 33), variants selected with L .A . Morrison and B .N. Fields antibody to the VP1 protein possess tissue-specific alterations in extent and duration of infection and in capacity to induce demyelination . 13 But not all changes in viral genes are attenuating : mutations causing reversion to neurovirulence have been identified in poliovirus isolates from the feces of recipients of the attenuated trivalent oral vaccine . 34 Mutations in genes encoding proteins other than those of the capsid or envelope can also result in attenuation, for example, sequences encoding a retroviral core protein or in the 5' noncoding region of poliovirus RNA . 34 Transacting transcriptional activators may play a role in determining virulence, exemplified by a mutant of HIV with a defective tatIII gene that shows reduced replication and cytopathic effect .3,6 Importantly, neurovirulence may be under multigenic control and determinants of virulence may differ depending on the host species infected . 3 CNS injury resulting from viral infections Viral infections of the nervous system can have very severe consequences because the neurons vital to host function and survival cannot be replaced once injured or destroyed ; the effect of even minor damage may be catastrophic .2 Furthermore, once infection in the CNS has begun, the reduced permeability and dense structure of the blood-brain barrier which often impedes the initial spread of virus to the CNS may reduce the capacity of the host to resolve infection and limit injury. 9 Injury at a cellular level may be directly due to virus infection, occurring when cytopathic effect is significant enough to damage irreparably the plasma membrane (lysis) or to arrest metabolic activity by inhibition of protein, RNA or DNA synthesis, e .g . poliovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus and herpesvirus, respectively . 35,36 Viruses such as rabies may alter nerve impulse conductance without histologically perturbing infected neurons . 19 Accumulations of virus capsids or even individual viral proteins may in themselves be toxic . The sequence homology between HIV gp120 envelope protein and certain essential neurotransmitters and neuropeptides has evoked the hypothesis that competitive binding of gp120 may block normal neuronal function (see Tillman and Wigdahl, this issue 37). gp120 also mediates another potential form of direct injury by virus, syncytium formation . Indirect injury to cells has been postulated to occur by release of toxic`factors' from neighboring cells damaged by infection . 36 Systemic injury occurs by both direct and indirect mechanisms as well . The consequences of infection vary with the location and function of tissue injured by the virus : for example, motor neuron destruction in poliomyelitis results in paralysis ; demyelinating reactions to virus infection cause incoordination ; and virus infections of cells in the developing nervous system produce a variety of congenital abnormalities and neurological diseases (see Coyle, this issue, 32 and refs 19, 38) . Indirect mechanisms of viral injury to the host CNS include the actions of interferons, 39-41 and the virus-specific cellular and humoral immune response (see Sedgwick and D\u00f6rries, this issue, 42 and refs 2, 40, 43) .",

In lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection of newborn mice, chronic production of virus occurs without serious detriment to cells . 43 A more thorough understanding of these stages in pathogenesis of viral CNS infections may engender new or more effective measures for prevention of disease . Development of more efficacious vaccines is a primary objective but requirements for protection from individual viruses differ . 40,50 Knowledge of pathogenetic stages of each virus may reveal points of greatest vulnerability and will help to determine requirements for stimulating immunity with a minimum of immunopathological side effects . Ideally, infection by any virus with potential to invade the CNS should be stopped before entering the nervous system . Characterization of neurotropic virus infections also offers interesting possibilities for studying structure and function of the nervous system . Basic neurological and neuroscience research has begun to benefit from using the strongly neurotropic rabies, HSV and pseudorabies viruses for tracing neural pathways . 51 More speculative is the use of attenuated neurotropic viruses for delivering foreign proteins into regions of the CNS defined through studies of viral pathogenesis . Foreign genes can be packaged by many viruses and may be selectively expressed, permitting intracerebral production of pharmacological agents or neurotransmitters . Thus studies of viral pathogenesis of the CNS may offer tools for the future as well as an understanding of disease states .",

            "text": "take up and transport the virus into the CNS . 20 Studies with poliovirus highlight the complexities encountered in determining whether spread occurs by neural or blood-borne routes . The virus initially replicates in Peyer's patches in the ileum, 21,22 from whence it enters the lymphatics and the blood stream . Elimination of viremia by administration of passive antibody coincides with blockade of neuronal infection and has been taken as evidence of blood-borne spread . Yet neural spread has been well-documented after experimental peripheral inoculation of poliovirus strains . 21 Such spread might occur in natural infection through nerve endings in the gastrointestinal tract and through motor nerve terminals in secondarily infected tissues, by analogy to events recently described for reovirus infection L . A . Morrison and B. of a virus to infect specific populations of cells within the CNS defines its neurotropism . Neurotropism is influenced by viral genes acting at several steps in the viral replication cycle, and by host cell expression of receptors and enzymatic activities . Distinct patterns of injury and ultimately of disease result from interplay between attributes of the infected host and the infecting virus . The interaction of viral cell-attachment proteins with specific receptors on host cells regulates viral entry and is a major determinant of viral tropism . 3,24-26 Several proteins have been identified that normally serve various physiological functions in the host nervous system but that can be usurped by viruses as viral receptors (Table 2) . HSV has been recently shown to bind the basic fibroblast growth factor receptor, 27 richly expressed in the nervous system . Serotype 3 reovirus binds to a protein possessing biochemical similarity to the /3-adrenergic receptor on neurons and lymphocytes, 3,26 although this may not be its only receptor molecule, or even the main receptor used in vivo . The nicotinic Schematic representation of reovirus serotype 3 entry into the intestinal tract and possible routes of spread from the intestine . (1) Reovirus (and poliovirus) particles are transcytosed by M cells overlying Peyer's patches of the small intestine .22,2 . (2) Reovirus apparently replicates in mononuclear cells in the Peyer's patch and in adjacent myenteric neurons between the muscle layers beneath the patch . (3) From Peyer's patches in the wall of the small intestine, reovirus enters both efferent lymphatic capillaries and nerves but initially spreads to the CNS through nerve fibers innervating the intestine . Poliovirus also replicates in intestinal tissue 21 in unknown cell type(s) and similarly has local access to nerve terminals as well as to the blood stream as potential routes of spread to the CNS .
