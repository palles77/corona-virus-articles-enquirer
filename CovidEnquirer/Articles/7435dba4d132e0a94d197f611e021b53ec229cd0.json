Four antigenic sites have been defined (A, B, C, and D ). The sites involved in the neutralization of TGEV are: A, D, and B, sites A and D being antigenically dominant for TGEV neutralization in vitro. These two sites have specific properties of interest: site A is highly conserved and is present in coronaviruses of three animal species, and site D can be represented by synthetic peptides. Both sites might be relevant in protection in vivo. PRCV does not have sites B and C, due to a genomic deletion. Complex antigenic sites, i.e., conformation and glycosylation dependent sites, have been represented by simple mimotopes selected from a library expressing recombinant peptides with random sequences, or by anti-idiotypic internal image monoclonal antibodies. An epidemiological tree relating the TGEVs and PRCVs has been proposed. The estimated mutation fixation rate of 7 + 2 \u00d7 10-4 substitutions per nucleotide and year indicates that TGEV related coronaviruses show similar variability to other RNA viruses. In order to induce secretory immunity, different segments of the S gene have been expressed using avirulent forms of Salmonella typhimuriurn and adenovirus. These vectors, with a tropism for Peyer's patches may be ideal candidates in protection against TGEV.",

Within this family, TGEV forms an antigenic cluster with feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), feline en-teric coronavirus (FECV), canine coronavirus (CCV), and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) ( S~inchez et al., 1990 ) . Vaccines developed against transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) are not efficient (Moxley et al., 1989) . TGEV has three structural proteins: the spike (S), the nucleoprotein (N), and the membrane (M) protein (Jim6nez et al., 1986; Spaan et al., 1988) . Protein S is the major inducer of TGEV neutralizing antibodies. In this protein, four antigenic sites (A, B, C, and D) have been defined by mutual competition of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Site A is antigenically dominant and has been divided into three antigenic subsites: Aa, Ab, and Ac . Three of the antigenic sites overlap with the sites described by others Delmas et al., 1990) . Sites A and D, and to a minor extent site B, have been involved in the neutralization ofTGEV (Delmas et al., 1986; Jim6nez et al., 1986) , and the mechanisms of TGEV neutralization have been described .",

Site A includes amino acids 538, 591 and 543, which are essential in the formation of subsites Aa, Ab and Ac, respectively. In addition, changes in amino acid 586 have partially altered both subsite Aa and Ab, indicating that these subsites overlap in residue 586. Other amino acids contribute to site B (residues 97 and 144), site C (residues 50 and 51 ), and site D (residue 385). The location of site D by sequence analysis is in agreement with epitope scanning techniques. Site C can be represented by peptides 48-P-P/S-N-S-D/E-52, it is not exposed on the surface of native virus, but its accesibility can be modulated by treatment at pH > 11 (at 4\u00b0C) or temperatures > 45\u00b0C. Sites A and B are fully dependent on glycosylation for proper folding, while sites C and D are independent of glycosyla- tion, respectively. Once the S glycoprotein has been assembled into the virion, the carbohydrate moiety is not essential for the antigenic sites.",

Even by directly infecting the intestinal tract with the PRCVs, only a few cells are infected, which are different to the epithelial cells of the villi, susceptible to the enteric viruses (Cox et al., 1990a; Cox et al., 1990b) . These results imply that both types of viruses have different tropism. It could be proposed that the enteric or respiratory tropism of TGEV is conditioned by two receptor binding sites (RBS), located in the S protein (Fig. 4) . The receptor binding site conferring respiratory tropism (RBS-R) should map in an area present in both TGEVs and PRCVs, while the RBS conferring enteric tropism (RBS-E) would have full activity only in TGEV isolates. Candidate domains for the location of this RBS-R could be the highly conserved areas detected between amino acids 181 to 243, or 303 to 337 (residue numbers correspond to the position that these amino acids have in the PRCV sequence) (S~inchez et al., 1992) . In ST (swine testicle) cells, the RBS of TGEV probably maps within sites A and D, since mAbs specific for these sites inhibit the binding of the virus to ST cells . The RBS conferring the enteric tropism is probably located between amino acids 21 to 244, or a domain structurally influenced by one of these residues, since they were absent in all PRCV isolates sequenced (Fig. 2 ) S~inchez et al., 1992; Wesley et al., 1991 ) . Alternative explanations to understand the tropism of these viruses are also possible (see Discussion).",

In addition, the genetic homology among viruses of the TGEV antigenic cluster has been shown, and an evolutionary tree has been proposed, to establish the relationship among these viruses and their possible origin. Information on the antigenic structure and the conservation of the different sites involved in virus neutralization, allowed the selection of several antigenic determinants potentially involved in protection. S gene segments coding for these sites have been cloned in vectors with tropism for Peyer's patches, such as S. typhimurium and adenovirus, to test their role in protection against TGEV. The enterophathogenic TGEV was first isolated in 1946 (Doyle and Hutchings, 1946) . In 1984, a non-enteropathogenic virus, the PRCV, related to TGEV appeared. In contrast to TGEV, PRCV exhibited no clinical signs of disease (Pensaert et al., 1986; Callebaut et al., 1988) . The antigenic homology among isolates of TGEV and PRCV has been clearly documented (Callebaut et al., 1988; Garwes et al., 1988; Rasschaert et al., 1990; S~inchez et al., 1990; Wesley et al., 1990) . The analysis of the antigenic structure of TGEV S protein has shown that the half amino terminus is highly immunogenic and that it contains the four antigenic sites defined by two groups (Delmas et al., 1986; Correa et al., 1988; Correa et al., 1990) . In contrast, the PRCVs have lost sites B and C, due to a deletion of 224 or 227 amino acids in the S protein. This type of deletion has not been found in the fibrilar portion of the peplomer. Sites A and D are present in both enteric and respiratory viruses, and they are the major inducers of neutralizing antibodies. Hence, it could be expected that the variability in the globular portion of the S molecule might be higher than in the fibrilar domain. Although a few more nucleotide changes were concentrated in these sites, the overall homology in the globular and fibrilar domains was the same (S~inchez et al., 1992) .",

The RBS-E conferring enteric tropism has been proposed to be located in the area missing in the PRCVs, which do not infect enteric tissues. Nevertheless, it can not be excluded that this RBS-E would be located in another domain that requires the presence of amino acids 21 to 249 to keep its functionality. An alternative explanation is the existence of a RBS which could adopt two conformations, depending on the sequence of distal domains of the S glycoprotein. These functional models assume that the ability of a virus to infect respiratory or enteric tissues, only depends on the presence of a receptor in the host cell which will recognize a RBS present on the virus. In contrast, it cannot be excluded that the expression of other genes such as those coding for the nonstructural proteins, is involved in the tropism of these viruses. Hence, more information is required before a definite location of the RBS (s) is made.",

Since we are dealing with a limited number of isolates from each continent, it might be anticipated that the inclusion of new isolates from other areas (e.g., Japan) could show that certain lateral branches would become main branches. A mutation fixation rate of 0.95 _+ 0.05 nucleotide substitutions per year, approximately constant with time has been shown, suggesting the existence of a well defined molecular clock (Kimura, 1983) . From the mutation fixation rate, and the number ofnucleotides considered, the number of substitutions per nucleotide and year can be estimated at 7_+2\u00d7 10 -4 . This rate falls into the range reported for other RNA viruses (Domingo and Holland, 1988) .",
