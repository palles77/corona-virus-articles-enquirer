Warb., and its racemate and derivatives were synthesized. When their anti-tumor activities were evaluated, compounds 2, 11, and 2b were found to have potency against the cultured human-tumor cell lines HeLa, A549, CNE, and MCF in vitro. The SAR (structure-activity relationship) was discussed. The structure-activity relationship studies of 1,4-dihydropyridine-3-carboxylic acid derived N-type calcium channel blockers were reported. As a consequence of this study, we found orally active 4-(3-chloro-phenyl)-2-methyl-6-trifluoromethyl-1,4-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic acid 5-(3,3-diphenylpropyl) ester (21b). A series of 2,5 thiazole containing compounds are described, which are potent antagonists of the integrin a v b 3 and show selectivity relative to the other integrins, such as a IIb b 3 and a v b 6 . These analogs were demonstrated to have high bioavailability relative to other relative heterocyclic analogs.",

Based on the examination of the X-ray crystallographic structures of the LBD of TRa and TRb in complex with KB-141 (2), a number of novel 4 0 -hydroxy bioisosteric thyromimetics were prepared. Optimal affinity and b-selectivity (33 times) was found with a medium size alkyl substituted amido group; iso-butyl (12c). It can be concluded that bioisosteric replacements of the 4 0 -hydroxy position represent a new promising class of TRb-selective synthetic thyromimetics. The preparation and biological evaluation of 5-substituted-6-hydroxy-2-(anilino)pyrimidinones as a new class of DNA polymerase IIIC inhibitors, required for the replication of chromosomal DNA in Gram-positive bacteria, are described. These new dGTP competitive inhibitors displayed good levels of in vitro inhibition and antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. A new class of dATP competitive inhibitors, 6-substituted-2-amino-5-alkyl-pyrimidin-4-ones, whose antibacterial activity was unaffected by serum, were identified. 3 0 ,4 0 ,5 0 -Trimethoxy benzoyl-naphthalene 2-O-acetic acid (5) underwent base catalysed intramolecular condensation to yield exclusively 1-(3 0 ,4 0 ,5 0 -trimethoxy) phenyl naphtho[2,1-b]furan 8, which has been characterised by spectroscopy. The reaction has been further extended to two more similar compounds 6 and 7 to get aryl naphtho[2,1-b]furans 9 and 10, respectively. These aryl naphthofurans (8 and 9) showed significant anticancer activity against various human cancer cell lines in the in vitro MTT assay. ",

The synthesis and structure-activity relationships (SAR) of a novel class of potent, orally active, non-peptidic vasopressin V 2 receptor selective agonists are described. Starting from potent aldehyde inhibitors with poor drug properties, derivatization to semicarbazones led to the identification of a series of semicarbazone-based cathepsin K inhibitors with greater solubility and better pharmacokinetic profiles than their parent aldehydes. Furthermore, a representative semicarbazone inhibitor attenuated bone resorption in an ex vivo rat calvarial bone resorption model. However, based on enzyme inhibition comparisons at neutral pH, semicarbazone hydrolysis rates, and 13 C NMR experiments, these semicarbazones probably function as prodrugs of aldehydes. ",
