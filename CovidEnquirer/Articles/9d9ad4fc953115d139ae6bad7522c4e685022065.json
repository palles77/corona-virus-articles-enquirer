In 2004, a novel human CoV (HCoV), named HCoV-NL63, was reported (4) , and the discovery of another novel HCoV, HCoV-HKU1, was described and further characterized in 2005 (5,6) and 2006 (7) . SARS-CoV-like viruses have also been reported in Chinese horseshoe bats in Hong Kong, China, and other horseshoe bats in China (8, 9) . The discovery in Chinese horseshoe bats in Yunnan, China, of a new SARS-CoV-like virus that uses ACE2 as receptor has furthered interest in discovering animal origins of human infections (10) . We have discovered 20 other animal CoVs that include 2 novel betacoronavirus lineages and a novel genus, Deltacoronavirus (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . From our studies, bats and birds were shown to be the gene sources for fueling the evolution and dissemination of alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses and of gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses, respectively (18) .",

A comparison of the amino acid sequences of DcCoV UAE-HKU23 spike protein and BCoV spike protein showed 81 aa polymorphisms, of which 24 were seen within the region previously identified as hypervariable among the spike protein of other betacoronavirus lineage A CoVs (31) ( Figure 2 ); this finding suggests that this region in DcCoV UAE-HKU23 is also subject to strong immune selection. BCoV has been found to use N-acetyl-9-O acetyl neuramic acid as a receptor for initiation of infection (32) . Among the 5 aa that may affect S1-mediated receptor binding in BCoV (31), 2 aa (threonine at position 11 and glutamine at position 179) were conserved in DcCoV UAE-HKU23 ( Figure 2 ). However, at positions 115, 118, and 173, aspartic acid, methionine, and asparagine observed in BCoV and were replaced by serine, threonine, and histidine, respectively, in DcCoV UAE-HKU23. A recent report identified 4 aa acids that were critical sugar-binding residues in the spike protein of BCoV (tyrosine, glutamic acid, tryptophan, and histidine at positions 162, 182, 184, and 185, respectively) (32); all 4 aa were also present in spike protein of DcCoV UAE-HKU23 ( Figure 2 ). Another study identified 7 aa substitutions in the spike protein of BCoV that differed between virulent and avirulent, cell culture-adapted strains (31); 5 of the 7 aa from virulent strains were also conserved in DcCoV UAE-HKU23, and amino acid substitutions were observed in the other 2 aa (threonine\u2192valine at position 40 and aspartic acid\u2192asparagine at position 470). It has also been reported that an amino acid change at position 531 of the spike protein of BCoV discriminated between enteric (aspartic acid/asparagine) and respiratory (glycine) strains (33) .

The positive samples were not collected from the same farm or stable. Moreover, there was >0.2% nt difference among the 3 complete genomes sequenced, indicating that the positive samples were not collected from a clonal outbreak. In our study, 21.3% of dromedary calves, but only 0.4% of adult dromedaries, were RT-PCR positive for DcCoV UAE-HKU23; this finding indicates that dromedary calves are probably more susceptible than adult dromedaries to infection with Dc-CoV UAE-HKU23. Furthermore, DcCoV UAE-HKU23 is probably stably evolving in dromedaries because the Ka/ Ks of all the coding regions in the genome were <0.5. In this study, 4 of the 12 positive samples were collected from dromedaries with diarrhea. A previous report also described the presence of a betacoronavirus in the fecal sample of a dromedary calf with diarrhea (35) . This finding raises the question of the pathologic significance of DcCoV UAE-HKU23 for camelids and warrants further animal studies.",

This finding is in line with findings from our previous studies of Ro-BatCoV HKU9, which also showed minimal serologic cross-reactivity among the 4 lineages of betacoronaviruses (16) . These results suggest that there should be minimal crossreactivity between DcCoV UAE-HKU23 and MERS-CoV, which belong to 2 different CoV lineages. Because we showed an extremely high prevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies in the serum samples by Western blot analysis, indirect immunofluorescence, and neutralization antibody testing, concurring with findings in a previous study (24) , we would also expect a similar high prevalence of DcCoV UAE-HKU23 antibodies if there was major serologic cross-reactivity between MERS-CoV and DcCoV UAE-HKU23. However, our serologic data only revealed the presence of DcCoV UAE-HKU23 antibodies in 52% of the serum samples, indicating that no correlation exists between seropositivity to DcCoV UAE-HKU23 and seropositivity to MERS-CoV.

This G+C content differs substantially from those of other CoV species of lineage A betacoronaviruses, which have G+C contents of 0.32 (HCoV-HKU1), 0.41 (rat CoV) and 0.42 (murine hepatitis virus) ( Table 2) . The difference in the genome characteristics between A1 and non-A1 members of betacoronavirus is also reflected by their codon usage bias, in which the general preference of using G/C in the third position of the codons decreases from murine hepatitis virus and rat CoV to betacoronavirus A1 members and RbCoV HKU14 to HCoV-HKU1 (online Technical Appendix Figure 2 ). The cleavage site for spike protein of betacoronavirus A1 members is RRS/QRR, whereas those of HCoV-HKU1, RbCoV HKU14, and murine hepatitis virus are RRKRR, LRSRR, and RAR/H/ DR/S, respectively. The length of membrane genes for betacoronavirus A1 members and RbCoV HKU14 is 693 bases, whereas the lengths for HCoV-HKU1 and murine hepatitis virus are 672 and 687 bases, respectively. DcCoV UAE-HKU23 is phylogenetically closely related to other betacoronavirus A1 members, which in turn are closely related to other CoVs of betacoronavirus lineage A. Despite their close relationships, no recombination was detected between DcCoV UAE-HKU23 and other betacoronavirus A1 members by bootscan analysis (data not shown). These CoVs of betacoronavirus A1 may be using different receptors in their corresponding hosts because their spike protein is one of the proteins that show the largest difference among different CoVs. Most of the differences among the spike proteins in different betacoronavirus A1 members were also observed in the N terminal half of their spike protein, where the receptor binding domains should be located.",

Camels are also important recreational animals in the Middle East and are used for camel racing. Having been associated with humans for at least 5,000 years, camels usually pose little physical danger to humans. However, infectious pathogens, such as brucellosis, can occasionally be transmitted from camels to humans. Apart from the present novel CoV, viruses of at least 8 taxonomic families (i.e., Paramyxoviridae, Flaviviridae, Herpesviridae, Papillomaviridae, Picornaviridae, Poxviridae, Reoviridae, and Rhabdoviridae) have been found to infect camels (37) (38) (39) .

Because MERS-CoV was not present in dromedaries in the present study, an intensive search in dromedaries and other animals in other locations in the Middle East would be helpful in the search for the animal source of MERS-CoV. DcCoV UAE-HKU23 is a member of betacoronavirus A1 (Figure 7). Comparison of the amino acid identities of the 7 conserved replicase domains for species demarcation (i.e., ADP-ribose 1\u2033-phosphatase, NSP5 [3CL pro ], NSP12 [RdRp], NSP13 [helicase], NSP14 [ExoN], NSP15 [Ne-ndoU], and NSP16 [O-MT]) (36) between DcCoV UAE-HKU23 and other CoVs of betacoronavirus A1 revealed that in all 7 domains, the amino acid sequences of DcCoV UAE-HKU23 and other betacoronavirus A1 members shared >90% identity. This finding indicates that DcCoV UAE-HKU23 should be a member of betacoronavirus A1. Furthermore, the genome characteristics of DcCoV UAE-HKU23 showed features similar to those of other betacoronavirus A1 members. The genomes of all betacoronavirus A1 members have G+C contents of 0.37 and the genome of RbCoV HKU14, a recently discovered CoV closely related to betacoronavirus A1",
