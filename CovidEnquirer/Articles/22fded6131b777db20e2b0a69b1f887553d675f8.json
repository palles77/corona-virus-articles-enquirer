Between 30% and 60% of adult HSCT recipients reportedly experience pulmonary complications, representing a major cause of mortality [1] [2] [3] [4] . In children undergoing HSCT, the incidence of pulmonary complications varies from 10% to 25%, and onset is a poor prognostic event carrying a significantly increased risk of mortality [5, 6] . At one time, most pulmonary complications were directly related to infection; today, however, noninfectious pulmonary complications, such as idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), are seen more frequently [2, 5, 6] .",

All patients had recovered from their initial URTI symptoms before a new episode of respiratory symptoms occurred, leading to the diagnosis of allo-LS. The presence of a single RV or multiple RVs, or the presence of rhinovirus and other (nonrhinovirus) RVs, was not associated with the development of allo-LS.

            "text": "A possible weakness of our study is that we changed our policy on testing for RV during the study period. In the early phase of the study, we tested NPA samples for RV only in those patients exhibiting symptoms. Later in the study period, once the significance of RV was recognized, weekly surveillance assays were done in all patients. These surveillance assays identified 7 RV-positive patients without symptoms at the time of sampling; however, all of these patients developed URTI symptoms within 14 days after positive sampling, and so these RVs would ultimately have been detected regardless of the testing policy. Thus, we believe that we did not miss any RV-positive patients in the presurveillance period, and that the change in testing policy had no major impact on our results (data not shown), the only difference being that the median time to RV positivity would have been shorter had we monitored the whole group routinely. Three patients with symptoms and a clinical course typical of viral URTI were considered RV-positive despite negative RV-PCR results. In these patients, symptoms might have resulted from a virus not detectable by our PCR panel. It would be interesting to test these for more recently identified viruses, such Boca and Wu/KI. Because of the obvious symptoms and the fact that other study groups have included similar patients in their analyses, we decided to do so as well [10] . Had we considered these patients RV-negative in our analysis, the results would have been the same (only 1 of the 3 patients developed allo-LS). We realize that we may well have missed some mild URTI symptoms in the period between discharge and day 1100 and so do not have full data on RV positivity after discharge from the hospital. No patient who was RV-PCR-negative on discharge developed allo-LS, however. Acquisition of RV very early after HSCT appears to be important for the development of allo-LS; the patients who were RV-positive within 16 days of HSCT tended to be more susceptible to allo-LS.",

In the consensus definition of IPS (established by a 1997 National Institutes of Health workshop), all infectious agents, including RVs, should be excluded. In our patients, we observed prolonged shedding of RV for months, and thus we could not formally diagnose IPS. In all patients, the initial URTI symptoms disappeared spontaneously within 1-2 weeks, however. Subsequently, after a period of at least 14 days without significant respiratory problems, symptoms of hypoxia and/or airway obstruction recurred. We believe that this represents not a direct progression of viral infection, but rather a combination of several factors in which alloreactivity (triggered by tissue damage because of persistent viral infection) plays a pivotal role. Therefore, we chose to define IPS as discussed earlier, not taking into account the presence of an RV identified by PCR as was done in this study. Moreover, the formal definition of IPS was promulgated in an era when molecular diagnosis of RV was not yet available. We hypothesize that RVs may contribute to the pathogenesis of any allo-LS as follows. The RV damages the respiratory epithelium, causing an inflammatory response at the time of immune recovery. Normally IPS and BOS/BOOP are viewed as distinct clinical entities, and so we first studied them separately. Because we noted the same strong associations among RV positivity, GVHD, and OS in the 2 groups, we combined both IPS and BOS/BOOP in subsequent analyses.",

Reported incidence varies from 1% to 56%. This wide range of incidence can be explained by differences among studies in the definition of RV infection, the period of monitoring for RV infection (eg, inpatients/outpatients, seasonal influence), and sensitivity of the analysis methods used. In our cohort, the high incidence of RV URTI (50%) might be attributed to our close monitoring for respiratory symptoms and performance of RT-PCR surveillance assays. In addition, nosocomial RV infections were frequently observed, and genotyping studies suggested that these had spread throughout the ward during the study period, also contributing to the relatively high incidence (data not shown).",

In our cohort, we found no direct progression to LRTI. Almost all patients had mild URTI symptoms and recovered spontaneously. The median day of onset of RV infection was only 16 days in our cohort, compared with at least 60 days in previous studies. Progression to LRTI might be expected in patients with RV infection early after transplantation, because of poor immune status, but this was not seen. In our opinion, it is more likely that the moment of immune recovery defines the onset of symptoms. What we define as IPS in this study (ie, symptoms after a period of quiescent RV infection) might have been reported in other studies as progressive viral pneumonia, with symptoms occurring at the onset of RV infection later after HSCT, when some immune recovery has already occurred.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of such a strong association between RV infection and life-threatening allo-LS. Earlier, Erard et al. [17] described a relationship between RV infection during the first 100 days after HSCT and a decline in airflow leading to increased overall mortality. The decline in airflow was detected immediately after infection and did not return to baseline values, suggesting sustained airway inflammation leading to permanent loss of lung function. Pulmonary disease was much more severe in our cohort compared with the cohort of Erard et al. [17] . This discrepancy can be explained by the early moment of RV infection, when immune recovery has not yet occurred and the persistent RV likely causes more tissue damage, ultimately resulting in a stronger inflammatory response. The absence of immunity at the time of primary RV infection also might explain the absence of an immediate decline in clinical lung function. Pulmonary function deteriorated only after at least 2 weeks after RV infection, when the first signs of immune recovery were evident. It would be interesting to routinely perform PFTs earlier after HSCT, but for reasons of hygiene and patient comfort, we decided not to do this in the present study.",

In those studies, aGVHD was associated with IPS, but other risk factors, including conditioning regimen and infection, might have been involved as well. cGVHD is considered an important risk factor for BOS in adults. Alloreactive T cells, in the context of aGVHD or cGVHD, play an important role in BOS [29] . BOS is also seen in the absence of cGVHD in 7%-18% of patients, however [27] . This percentage may be different in children, who are less susceptible to cGVHD [30] . Our finding that aGVHD grade II-IV in other organs has a protective effect on the development of allo-LS does not necessarily contradict these results. Like aGVHD, allo-LS is a manifestation of alloimmunity. We speculate that the apparent protective effect of aGVHD reflects the influence on alloreactive T cells of immunosuppressive agents used to treat aGVHD grade II-IV. None of our patients had lung involvement at the onset of aGVHD. This may be because the lungs are less susceptible to acute alloreactivity than the classic target organs of gut, liver, and skin. This is also reflected by the fact that the median time to allo-LS was longer (8 weeks) than the median time to aGVHD (4 weeks). All patients who developed allo-LS did so during tapering of immunosuppressive therapy or after this therapy had been stopped. All of the patients with aGVHD where on prolonged immunosuppressive therapy (including steroids) and thus likely had less chance to develop alloimmunity in the lungs. In other words, the RV-positive patients who did not develop allo-LS had significantly greater immune suppression than the RV-positive patients who did develop allo-LS (data not shown). This effect of immunosuppressive therapy on the development of allo-LS is in line with previous findings [31] . Regarding cGVHD, in contrast to other studies, in our cohort, only 1 of 12 patients (11%) with BOS had signs of cGVHD in other organs. Our finding of no association between cGVHD and BOS/BOOP might be because of the generally low incidence of cGVHD in the pediatric HSCT population. This, together with the fact that viral infections are more frequent in childhood, might make the respiratory epithelium a preferential target for chronic alloreactivity, at least in this pediatric cohort. No protective effect of cGVHD on the development of allo-LS was noted, most likely because cGVHD (mainly the limited form) was not treated with systemic immunosuppressive agents (eg, steroids).",

A recent prospective cohort study in 100 lung transplant recipients clearly showed had significantly more acute or chronic rejection episodes in patients with an RV infection occurring within 100 days posttransplantation [18] . BOS occurring after lung transplantation is considered a manifestation of allograft rejection [32, 33] because of an alloimmune process. Some animal models of lung transplantation have demonstrated an association between the presence of RV and the development of BOS exclusively in the allogeneic transplantation setting [34] . These results are in line with the association between RV infection and allo-LS seen in our HSCT population, and strongly support the hypothesis that airway damage from an RV infection alone does not lead to severe problems, but triggers alloimmunity. Because of this strong association, the current practice in lung transplantation is to increase immunosuppression by adding steroids in the presence of an RV infection posttransplantation, to avoid rejection (personal communication Lung transplantation programm UMC Groningen and UMC Utrecht, 2007). This practice has led to a decreased graft rejection rate.",

At present, we cannot predict which RV-positive patients are actually at risk for developing allo-LS. Early recognition of the disease by the detection of biomarkers associated with lung damage and the development of allo-LS, or the identification of certain risk groups by studying the genetic polymorphisms of innate immunity in these patients, might be of additional value to fine-tune the initiation or adjustment of immunosuppressive therapy in the HSCT setting.",

Tissue damage because of the persistence of RV in the lung might be a trigger for the development of allo-LS. aGVHD, but more likely greater immunosuppression because of the aGVHD, appears to protect for allo-LS. These findings suggest that prevention of RV infections early after HSCT is of utmost importance. In addition, prolonged immune suppression in transplant recipients with an RV infection might prevent development of allo-LS, in analogy with current practice in lung transplantation.",
