Diarrhoea, bloat, scours, mucoid enteritis, enterotoxaemia, gut stasis, wool-block, trichobezoars, enteritis, gastroenteropathy and mucoid enteropathy are among the variety of non-specific terms used to describe the diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. Many of the digestive disorders that afflict pet rabbits are related to diet and only a few are caused by enteric pathogens. There is a complex inter-relationship between the predisposing factors and causes of digestive disease. This interrelationship is summarized in Figure 8 .1. Enteric disease is manifested by a disruption in normal faecal production. The consistency and frequency of hard and/or soft faeces are altered. There may be mucus production. The term 'diarrhoea' can be confusing, both to owners and to vets, and it is necessary to discriminate between true diarrhoea and a failure to eat caecotrophs. A list of differential diagnoses of 'diarrhoea' is given in Table 8 .1.",

            "text": "A detailed description of the rabbit's digestive physiology is given in Section 1.3.1. Briefly, the rabbit is a strict herbivore whose digestive system is adapted for the ingestion of a fibrous diet. Digestion in the stomach and small intestine is similar to monogastric animals and food that reaches the hindgut is mainly composed of fibre that cannot be broken down by the digestive enzymes of the stomach and small intestine. The rabbit has the ability to separate large fibre particles from small fibre particles in the proximal colon. The small particles and the large undigested particles are simultaneously sent in opposite directions. Large particles of undigested fibre pass distally and are excreted in hard faecal pellets. Small fibre particles are sent in a retrograde direction into the caecum where they undergo bacterial fermentation. Bacterial fermentation within the caecum releases volatile fatty acids that are absorbed as an energy source. The result of bacterial fermentation within the caecum is a fine paste containing amino acids, vitamins, enzymes, micro-organisms and volatile fatty acids.",

For most of the day, it mixes and separates ingesta, simultaneously sending indigestible particles towards the anus, and fermentable particles towards the caecum. Periodically, the motility of the proximal colon alters completely, and pasty caecal contents are directed along the colon to be expelled as soft faecal pellets or caecotrophs. Caecotroph production follows a diurnal rhythm. Most rabbits produce soft faeces during the morning and evening approximately 4 h after feeding. These caecotrophs are re-ingested directly from the anus to be digested in the stomach and small intestine as an additional source of nutrients for the rabbit. The nature of the intestinal contents, muscular activity, transit time and exchange of water and electrolytes alter according to the type of faeces passing through the colon. Therefore, digestion and colonic motility can be in either the 'hard faeces phase' or the 'soft faeces phase' (see Figure 1 .4). The amount of ingesta and gas in the various sections of the digestive tract alters according to the phase of excretion. The size and shape of the caecum also follows a diurnal rhythm, which is an important consideration during abdominal palpation or radiography of rabbits.",

Sacculations in the wall of the proximal colon (haustra) retain small particles while the larger particles accumulate in the lumen. Haustral activity directs small particles towards the caecum, while segmental activity directs large particles towards the anus. Lagomorphs have a specially adapted muscular segment of the colon known as the fusus coli that contains a large number of mucus glands (see Figure 1 .5). The fusus coli acts as pacemaker for colonic motility. It is highly innervated and vascular and it is not only controlled by the autonomic nervous system but also subject to the effects of metabolites and hormones such as aldosterone and prostaglandins. During the excretion of caecotrophs, haustral activity ceases and caecal material is moved swiftly along the large colon. In the fusus coli, the material is formed into pellets that become encapsulated in mucus (see Figure 1 .5). The transit time for soft faeces through the colon is 1.5-2.5 times faster than that for hard faeces (Fioramonti and Ruckesbusch, 1976) .",

Rabbits produce two types of droppings, i.e. hard faeces and caecotrophs. Normal caecotrophs are soft in consistency and are often mistaken for diarrhoea. The nature and frequency of both types of faeces are an important consideration. In some conditions, there is also excessive mucus production that can be mistaken for diarrhoea. the circulation. The retention time of digesta within the caecum is affected by both caecocolonic motility and the nature of ingesta that reaches it. Conditions within the caecum are affected by the type and amount of nutrients that supply the microflora and the products of bacterial fermentation.

Bacteroides spp. predominate in a microflora composed of aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive and -negative rods, cocci, filaments, coccobacilli and spirochaetes. In addition to the aerobic flora, over 74 strains of anaerobic bacteria have been isolated from the caecal mucosa and many of these species have not been cultivated (Straw, 1988) . The microbial flora can contain small numbers of potential pathogens such as Clostridium spp. Stress has an effect on caecal microflora. Increased glucocorticoid levels increase coliform counts and narrow the aerobicto-anaerobic bacteria ratio in the gut (Straw, 1988) . Changes in the caecal microflora can be seen in Gram-stained smears of caecal contents. In the healthy rabbit, high numbers of large anaerobic metachromatic bacteria (LAMB) and protozoa are present. In rabbits suffering from mucoid enteropathy, a drop in the number of LAMB and protozoa and an increase in coliforms are found (Lelkes and Chang, 1987) .",

Changes in caecal pH alter the caecal microflora and can result in the proliferation of pathogens. The proportions of volatile fatty acids in the caecum influence appetite and gut motility. In healthy rabbits, acetates predominate, followed by butyrates and propionates. Low fibre diets result in decreased acetates and increased propionates and butyrates.

In wild rabbits and those pet rabbits that eat a natural diet of grass and hay, a healthy gut flora that is resilient to any minor dietary changes that occur as the result of eating novel foods becomes established. In contrast, in intensive situations where large numbers of rabbits are kept in a small space and fed on artificial diets containing products that rabbits would not normally eat, alterations in the intestinal microflora can rapidly result in the proliferation of pathogens and the development of enteritis. Large numbers of pathogenic bacteria are most likely to be present in intensive situations. Commercial rabbits are young, growing animals, in which a healthy caecal microflora has not become established. Because of the financial importance of losses due to enteric disease in commercial units, extensive research has been carried out into the effects of varying dietary protein, carbohydrate and fibre levels on caecal microflora and volatile fatty acid production. These considerations are beyond the remit of this book, which is mainly concerned with the individual pet rabbit and not commercial rabbit production.

            "text": "It is not possible to consider any digestive problem in rabbits without examining the diet. The role of fibre and its 'digestibility' or 'indigestibility' is an important concept in the understanding of digestive disease in rabbits. Fibre digestion depends upon the presence of cellulolytic bacteria within the digestive tract. In rabbits the term 'digestibility' includes bacterial degradation or fermentation within the caecum, and not just digestion in the stomach and small intestine. For this reason, the term 'fermentable fibre' may be less confusing than 'digestible fibre'. Bacterial fermentation of fibre within the caecum varies according to the chemical structure and particle size (see Figure 1 .6). For example, hemicellulose is more digestible than lignin. Small particles enter the caecum where their digestibility is affected by their size. Smaller particles of fermentable fibre have a relatively greater surface area for bacteria to adhere to and are digested more quickly than the larger particles. Very large particles (> 0.5 mm) do not enter the caecum and are expelled, undigested, in the hard faeces. Although it has no nutritive value, indigestible fibre is an essential part of the diet because it stimulates gut motility, which sends nutrients and fluids into the caecum for bacterial fermentation. Insufficient indigestible fibre results in slow gut motility and retention of hair and ingesta in the stomach. Reduced motility in the proximal colon affects the separation of intestinal contents and reduces the supply of digesta and fluid to the caecum. Lack of both fermentable and indigestible fibre results in changes in caecal pH, volatile fatty acid distribution and the balance of microbial flora. Alterations in the populations of micro-organisms can allow enteric pathogens to proliferate. Therefore, although a low level of dietary fibre may not actually cause disease, it is a major predisposing factor. Additional factors such as coccidiosis or treatment with ampicillin are needed to cause pathological disease in commercial rabbits fed on a low fibre diet (Licois and Mongin, 1980) . The caecal appendix is larger in rabbits on a low fibre diet, suggesting either an increased demand for the buffering effects of bicarbonate or an increase in lymphoid activity in response to greater production of bacterial toxins (Cheeke et al., 1986) .",

However, processing the food to reduce the indigestible fibre down to particles small enough to enter the caecum will suppress appetite. Lignin is not digested by the caecal bacteria, whereas cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin are.

Disturbances in water, electrolyte and acid-base balance have a rapid and profound effect on health. Water and electrolytes are continually exchanged along the digestive tract and, in rabbits, any condition that affects this cycle of secretion and absorption also affects fluid and electrolyte balance (see Figure 1 .4). Saliva is constantly produced by rabbits and, during the hard faeces phase, water is secreted into the stomach and proximal colon. It is then reabsorbed from the caecum and distal colon. Dehydration develops rapidly during intestinal disease, despite no obvious fluid loss in vomit or diarrhoea. Conditions that cause intestinal obstruction result in the accumulation of large amounts of fluid proximal to the site of obstruction. Conversely, gastrointestinal hypomotility reduces the secretion of water into the stomach and results in impaction of the contents. Dehydration is associated with gastrointestinal hypomotility, presumably due to decreased absorption of water from the stomach, caecum and distal colon.",

Anorexia in rabbits can quickly lead to metabolic acidosis (see Section 8.3.2) and the limited ability of the rabbit kidney to correct acid-base disorders makes the species vulnerable to the effects of acidosis or alkalosis (see Section 1.13.12). Changes in acid-base status can affect the contractility of the proximal colon (Lofqvist and Nilsson, 1981) , which, in turn, will affect the secretion of water and its absorption from the caecum. Therefore, effective fluid therapy is a vital part of the treatment of many gastrointestinal diseases in rabbits (see Section 3.11). Decisions on what fluid to administer should be based on electrolyte status determined by blood sampling. Intravenous or intraosseous fluid therapy is necessary for most cases. Although subcutaneous fluids can be used, they are not suitable for ill, dehydrated or hypotensive patients as absorption of fluids from under the skin is poor when peripheral tissue perfusion is reduced by shock or hypovolaemia.",

It was thought that the trichobezoar caused a pyloric obstruction. Anorexia, weight loss, reduced faecal output, depression and death due to starvation were attributed to the presence of a trichobezoar. Many theories were put forward about the cause of trichobezoar formation. Handbooks and leaflets on rabbit care suggest that regular grooming is required to prevent excessive amounts of hair being swallowed and becoming impacted in the stomach. Some breeders still recommend one day a week without food for rabbits in order to 'clear the system' of ingested hair. Boredom, magnesium or copper deficiency, inadequate protein, individual caging and the presence of air filtration barriers have all been put forward as potential causes of trichobezoar formation (Ojerio and Ladiges, 1981) . The rabbit's inability to vomit has also been cited as a contributory factor (Gillett et al., 1983) . Treatment was usually unsuccessful. The administration of liquid paraffin to lubricate the gastric contents and that of pineapple juice to dissolve the hair enzymatically with bromelain were suggested as therapies. Surgical removal of the trichobezoar was a last resort and carried a poor prognosis. The association between trichobezoars and fatty liver was noted by many authors (Gillett et al., 1983; Ojerio and Ladiges, 1981 ). An association with pregnancy toxaemia was made by Patton et al.

On postmortem examination, the rabbit's stomach is never found to be empty (Okerman, 1988) and the presence of a small amount of fibrous food is normal. The presence of hair entangled in the food is also a normal finding because rabbits are continually grooming and ingesting large amounts of hair. In 1984, Leary et al. attempted to induce the clinical syndrome associated with the presence of trichobezoars by the orogastric infusion of latex to reproduce a gastric foreign body. Monthly radiographs were taken and the rabbits monitored closely for food intake and faecal output for 24 weeks after infusion. Gastrotomies were then performed to remove the foreign material and the rabbits monitored closely for a further 4 weeks prior to euthanasia and post-mortem examination. The presence of a latex bezoar did not have any adverse effect on appetite and weight gain of any of the 12 rabbits that were infused. In the same study, the stomach contents of 208 clinically healthy commercial rabbits were examined after slaughter and well-defined trichobezoars were found in 23% of them. This study cast doubt on the concept that trichobezoars cause anorexia. In 1986, Fekete and Bokori found elevated cortisol levels in rabbits with trichobezoars, although they concluded that the elevation was associated with the stress of having a trichobezoar rather than the trichobezoar being the result of stress. In 1987, Buckwell described the successful medical treatment of 'gut stasis' in rabbits exhibiting anorexia, reduced water intake, depression, weight loss and absence of faecal pellets. He described the presence of a palpable impacted mass in the region of the stomach. Treatment consisted of the administration of a motility stimulant, corticosteroid, oral fluid and the provision of hay. Since that time, trichobezoars have increasingly become recognized as the result, rather than the cause, of reduced gastrointestinal motility and are secondary to many other conditions. Pain, stress and fright can all reduce gastrointestinal motility and lead to the accumulation of hair in the stomach and the formation of trichobezoars. In one study by Jackson (1991) , intestinal stasis occurred more frequently in a group of laboratory rabbits that were restrained without the use of a towel.

Stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system causes adrenal hormones to be released into the circulation. One of the effects of adrenaline and noradrenaline is the inhibition of gastrointestinal motility. If gastrointestinal motility is reduced, water secretion into the stomach is also reduced and hair and ingesta accumulate and become impacted. The rabbit appears to be particularly susceptible to the effects of catecholamines on gut motility. In healthy rabbits with an uninterrupted daily routine, the passage of soft and hard faeces follows a circadian rhythm, with an average day-to-day variation of approximately 30 minutes. Stress or even alterations in routine can have a significant effect on the caecotrophic rhythm. Simply switching a light on during the normal period of darkness caused one rabbit to stop producing faeces for 10 days in a study of caecotrophic rhythm by Jilge (1980) . Thunderstorms, bonfire night, predator attacks, pain and surgery can all slow gut motility and, if left untreated, result in impacted stomach contents and trichobezoar formation. Gut motility is affected by the indigestible fibre component of the diet. The provision of a high fibre diet has long been recognized as a preventative measure for the formation of hairballs (Sandford, 1996) . Rabbits fed on a low fibre diet are at greater risk of developing gastric stasis and trichobezoar formation. Rabbits with slow gut motility crave fibre and will often eat hay or grass in preference to other foods. The provision of palatable indigestible fibre for rabbits that are at risk of gut stasis, e.g. postoperatively, is important. Fresh grass is the most acceptable form of fibre for rabbits, although good-quality hay is acceptable.",

Volatile fatty acids are a major energy source and represent about 40% of the maintenance energy requirement of rabbits (Marty and Vernay, 1984) . They are absorbed from the digestive tract during digestion of caecotrophs and from the caecum where volatile fatty acids are produced by bacterial fermentation. Concentrations of volatile fatty acids in arterial blood are kept constant by the liver, despite fluctuations in absorption from the digestive tract. Volatile fatty acid absorption from the gut varies with the hard or soft Textbook of Rabbit Medicine phase of faecal excretion (Vernay, 1987) and is affected by gut motility.

The resultant drop in glucose and glucogenic volatile fatty acid absorption results in hypoglycaemia, which stimulates lipolysis and the mobilization of free fatty acids from adipose tissue. The free fatty acids are transported to the liver to be metabolized as an energy source. The major pathway for their degradation is that of b-oxidation and ketone body production. Ketoacidosis occurs when ketone body production exceeds tissue metabolism. Rabbits do not have effective metabolic pathways for correcting acidosis (see Section 1.3.12) and are particularly susceptible to the effects of ketoacidosis. Also, during periods of increased mobilization of free fatty acids, a 'bottleneck' develops in the liver, which impairs the metabolic pathways that result in lipid transport to other tissues. Fat accumulates in the hepatocytes, causing cholestasis and eventual liver failure and death. Hepatic lipidosis occurs most readily in obese rabbits because they have already accumulated triglycerides in the hepatocytes.",

This increase did not occur in younger, lighter rabbits. a-Adrenergic responsiveness is increased in the large fat cells of obese rabbits in comparison with the small fat cells of underfed rabbits (Lafontan, 1981) . High fat diets greatly increase the risk of hepatic lipidosis. In a study by Jean-Blain and Durix (1985) , rabbits fed on a high fat diet showed a twofold increase in ketonaemia during a period of fasting and were more hypoglycaemic than rabbits fed on a low fat diet. Obesity is a major problem in pet rabbits and animals that already have fatty livers can rapidly develop hepatic lipidosis if they become anorexic.

A reduced appetite and a reduction in faecal output are the early warning signs (Table 1.6). As the disease progresses, the rabbit becomes totally inappetent and depressed. It adopts a hunched appearance and may sit for hours, immobile in the corner of the cage or hutch. Affected rabbits do not groom and appear to be oblivious to their surroundings. They are no longer inquisitive and do not respond to being spoken to or the offer of an interesting titbit. The rabbit becomes clinically dehydrated.

A blood sample can aid differential diagnosis, assist with choice of fluid therapy and offer prognostic indicators. A lipaemic sample or the presence of hyperglycaemia in conjunction with ataxia is a poor prognostic sign. In the early stages, hypoglycaemia may be found. This is treated by oral, subcutaneous or intravenous glucose therapy. In contrast, some rabbits show hyperglycaemia in the early stages of the disease associated with stress or pain. A blood glucose value within the normal reference range is reassuring. A PCV in excess of 40-45% indicates dehydration. Prerenal azotaemia is common in rabbits with gastrointestinal stasis. It is found in conjunction with dehydration. Blood urea and creatinine levels can be markedly elevated. If the analytical equipment is available, electrolyte status is invaluable.

Good-quality hay is important, both to stimulate appetite and to provide a sense of security to reduce stress levels. A bed of hay smells familiar. Grass and hay provide long particles of indigestible fibre that are important to stimulate gut motility. A quiet environment away from predators and barking dogs is important. In the initial stages (less than 24 h), analgesia and the provision of palatable fibre can be sufficient to stimulate gut motility and prevent progression of the disease. In the later stages (more than 24 h without food), syringe feeding is required to provide calories and fluid to soften and lubricate impacted stomach contents and provide water and electrolytes.

Pur\u00e9ed vegetables or baby foods provide an easily assimilated digestible energy source that can be given through a syringe, although these are not sufficiently high in fibre. A source of fermentable fibre is important to provide nutrients for caecal bacteria. Indigestible fibre is difficult to administer through a syringe because the large particles clog the nozzle; however, purpose-made support foods do contain some. There is no point in attempting to grind indigestible fibre down for syringe feeding in an attempt to stimulate gut motility. Grinding fibre to a particle size where it no longer clogs a syringe means that the particles are small enough to be moved into the caecum instead of the colon and the stimulatory action on the gut is lost. Nasogastric tube feeding may be necessary as a last resort for intractable cases, but nasogastric tubes can be counterproductive. They clog up easily and an Elizabethan collar is required. Elizabethan collars have been proven to be stressful to rabbits (Knudtzon, 1988) . Pharyngostomy tubes are somewhat more practical and are placed in much the same way as they are in cats. They have the advantage that being wider bore they are less likely to block; however, it is still difficult to get sufficiently fibrous food through. Pharyngostomy tubes also carry the risk of causing abscessation at the site of entry. The use of PEG tubes has been reported; however, this is not commonly done due to the risk of abscessation at the entrance site and the difficulty of inserting these in the rabbit. All three types of feeding tubes carry common disadvantages: they are unable to The topographical relationship of the liver, spleen, pancreas, small intestine and colon at three levels from superficial (ventral, A) to deep (dorsal, C.

They are, however, a means to an end where otherwise a patient may die. Total parenteral nutrition has also been reported occasionally in rabbits; however, this is unlikely to be available outside of large referral institutions and is associated with the risks of sepsis, anaphylaxis, cholestasis and inflammation of the gut lining.",

In a survey of 1000 post-mortem examinations by Hinton (1980) , 7.3% were found to have ulceration of the gastric mucosa. The majority of the ulcers were found in the fundic area of the stomach and did not exhibit significant tissue reaction, suggesting that the lesions had developed rapidly and were associated with the stress of the associated illness. In 2% of the rabbits, the ulcers were in the pyloric area and the majority of these had perforated the mucosa. Many of the pyloric ulcers were found in female rabbits that had died in the perinatal period. Experimental stress ulcers can be induced in the gastric mucosa of laboratory rabbits by administering intraperitoneal injections of adrenaline (Behara et al., 1980) .",

The clinical role of anti-ulcer preparations in the treatment of anorexic rabbits has not been evaluated but the possibility of gastric ulceration is a consideration when treating anorexic rabbits, especially when nonsteroidal preparations have been administered.

Rabbits continually secrete saliva and cannot vomit, so fluid collects in the stomach, which distends rapidly with fluid if ingesta cannot pass through and down the digestive tract. Gas is produced, which causes further distension. The stomach and intestine proximal to the obstruction becomes dilated with fluid and gas, giving a typical radiological picture (see Figure 8 .5). Typical foreign bodies include pellets of impacted 'felts' of hair, whole dried pulses, pieces of carpet fibre or other small objects. The small intestine is the usual site of obstruction although pyloric obstructions can occur. Rabbits normally ingest large amounts of hair during grooming, which passes through the digestive tract with no problem. It is felts of impacted, matted hair that cause obstructions. During moulting, large felts of hair can accumulate, especially on the plantar aspect of the metatarsus, and can be ingested by the rabbit during grooming. These felts of hair are found more frequently on angora rabbits and fluffy dwarf lops, although any breed can be affected. Rabbits with dental problems appear to be especially prone to intestinal obstruction. Rabbits with incisor problems cannot pull hair out effectively and large mats can build up before the rabbit can remove them. Owners of rabbits with grooming difficulties should be advised to watch for these felts and remove them promptly. Dried pulses such as locust bean seeds or dried peas or sweet corn can also be exactly the right diameter to occlude the small intestine. This type of ingredient should not be included in rabbit food. Again, rabbits with dental problems appear to be prone to swallowing such ingredients whole (Harcourt-Brown and Friggens, 1999) .",

A cystic calculus has been reported as a cause of intestinal blockage (Talbot and Ireton, 1975) . The severity of symptoms and the course of the disease are related to the site of the obstruction. Complete occlusion of the small intestine is rapid in onset and fatal unless the obstruction is removed promptly. Sometimes the foreign body can move through the small intestine, intermittently obstructing the intestine and causing abdominal pain and anorexia that passes off when the object passes through into the colon. The progress of the obstruction can be monitored radiographically from the gas shadows in the small intestine. The ileocaecal valve is a potential site of intestinal obstruction. Intestinal lymphoma has been found at this site in Digestive Disorders 8 two cases (Harcourt-Brown, unpublished data), one of which developed an intussusception of the colon into the caecum. Occlusion of the colon shows a more protracted course that lasts for days rather than hours. Obstructions of the large intestine are not caused by ingested foreign bodies, as the lumen of the small intestine is much smaller than that of the colon. Instead, tumours, adhesions and impacted caecal contents can obstruct the colon.",

Dehydration and an unusual feeling abdomen are evident. A distended stomach may be palpable in the cranial abdomen, especially on the left side. Alternatively, the abdomen may be distended and tympanic, or feel doughy if intestinal rupture has occurred. Electrolyte imbalances cause a variety of symptoms. Twitching, blindness and convulsions can occur in the terminal stages. Abdominal radiography is usually diagnostic.

In most cases, the intestinal condition is rapidly fatal, with death occurring within 12 h. There is a small chance of a moving foreign body passing through the small intestine and into the colon. Motility stimulants may aid this process but can also cause intestinal rupture if the gut is completely obstructed. Surgery is straightforward and successful if the case is presented early and surgery is performed rapidly. However, there are many potential life-threatening problems associated with enterotomy in rabbits; high-risk anaesthesia, narrow intestinal lumen, soft friable tissue, small omentum, propensity to develop adhesions, water and electrolyte imbalances, postoperative ileus, infection and risk of recurrence due to stenosis of gut. Long-haired rabbits or those with dental problems will still have the predisposing cause, even if they survive the surgery. Therefore, euthanasia is the most humane option unless the owners are keen for surgery, and accept all the risks and expense that are incurred.",

It is visibly distended with gas and fluid cranial to the obstruction. The topographical anatomy of the small intestine and its relationship to other abdominal organs is illustrated in Figure 8 .5. Once the obstruction is located, the intestinal loop can be exteriorized and the surrounding tissues protected by sterile absorbent material. The intestinal contents are milked away from the obstruction before applying bowel clamps or asking an assistant to occlude the intestine with digital pressure. The enterotomy incision is made along the antimesenteric edge of the intestine distal to the foreign body to avoid placing sutures in devitalized tissue. The foreign body is removed and any everted mucosa trimmed off before suturing the wound with a single layer of appositional interrupted sutures, making sure that they include the submucosa (see Figure 13 .1). A fine inert, absorbable monofilament suture material with a high tensile strength is required, such as 5/0 poliglecaprone (Monocryl) or polydioxanone (PDS II, Ethicon). The repair of an intestinal incision is difficult due to the small diameter of the organ and the friability of the tissue. It is important to avoid stenosis as much as possible as it increases the possibility of re-obstruction at a later date. If enterectomy is indicated, the intestine should be sectioned at a slight angle to preserve its antimesenteric vascularity. Although techniques such as side-to-side or sideto-end anastomosis can be performed, they have no advantage over an end-to-end anastomosis, which is technically simpler (Bouvy and Dupr\u00e9, 1997) . A good seal to prevent leakage of intestinal contents is necessary as omentalization is difficult in rabbits due to the small omentum. Post-surgical adhesions to other organs form readily.",

Metabolites and hormones affect the rabbit's appetite for caecotrophs (Fekete, 1989) . When food is scarce, all caecotrophs are consumed. When food is available ad libitum, the amount of caecotrophs consumed is influenced by the protein and fibre content of the diet. Increased levels of fibre increase caecotrophy, whereas high protein levels reduce it. Increasing the indigestible fibre component of the diet not only stimulates the rabbit to eat the caecotrophs but also makes the pellets firmer and less sticky. Healthy rabbits that eat a high fibre diet will consume all their caecotroph, whereas rabbits that are fed ad libitum on low fibre cereal diets will often leave caecotrophs uneaten. On some diets, particularly where certain herbs or legumes are included, the soft faeces appear less attractive than usual and are not ingested (Lang, 1981) . Many diseases alter normal caecotrophic function, either by altering the consistency and composition of the caecotrophs or by interfering with the ingestion of caecotrophs from the anus (see Figure 8 .6).",

Many conditions interfere with the ingestion of caecotrophs (see Figure 8 .6). Abnormalities in caecotrophy result in quantities of uneaten faecal material being deposited on the floor of the hutch or becoming entangled in the fur around the anus. The strong characteristic odour of uneaten caecotrophs and their soft, pasty consistency often misleads owners into believing their rabbit has diarrhoea. So, at the outset of the consultation, it is important to differentiate between uneaten soft faeces and true diarrhoea. Uneaten soft faeces is an unpleasant condition for both the owners and the rabbit but is not life threatening. Diarrhoea results in major disturbances in water and electrolyte metabolism and can be rapidly fatal. Caecotrophs are produced intermittently, usually once or twice every 24 h, when the animal is at rest. Copious amounts of hard faecal pellets are produced between episodes of soft faeces production and can be seen interspersed with any uneaten soft faeces in the bedding or on the floor of the hutch. Rabbits with enteritis and true diarrhoea do not produce hard faecal pellets. Instead, they produce soft faecal material that may be mixed with mucus. Rabbits suffering from caecotrophic disorders continue to eat well and produce large numbers of hard faecal pellets. Rabbits with diarrhoea are usually anorexic and depressed. Although uneaten caecotrophs are not directly life threatening, the implications for the welfare of the individual rabbit are far reaching. The condition is difficult to treat successfully in the short term and tends to recur. Owners become disillusioned and are deterred by the smell and inconvenience of bathing and cleaning their pet's perineum. The constant smell and presence of the faecal mass can result in owners abandoning their pet, either by releasing it into the wild or by leaving it permanently confined to its hutch. The strong smell of uneaten caecotrophs attracts bluebottles during the summer months and affected rabbits are high-risk candidates for fly strike.",

The perineum of a rabbit is a very sensitive area and if the skin is sore, the rabbit may be reluctant to groom the area and ingest caecotrophs as they arrive at the anus. A vicious circle is formed, which results in sore, inflamed infected perineal skin (see Figure 7 .3). Rabbits with fast-growing, soft, fluffy coats can develop large mats of fur around the anus and under the tail. This fluffy coat texture is impossible for these rabbits to groom themselves.

Obese rabbits are often too fat to turn round and reach their perineum, both to groom or to ingest caecotrophs. Loose-skinned individuals often develop large perineal skin folds, especially if they are overweight. These skin folds can become infected and sore, which makes grooming painful. Faecal material can become entrapped in the folds of skin and exacerbate the problem. Some obese females or even castrated males develop huge dewlaps that pose an additional physical barrier to the perineum. Rabbits that are fed ad libitum on low fibre diets are not only more likely to leave caecotrophs uneaten but are also likely to become fat and lazy. Musculoskeletal conditions that either affect the rabbit's flexibility or cause pain when it turns round to reach its anus also interfere with caecotrophy.

Dysautonomias have been described in dogs, hares, horses (grass sickness) and cats (Key-Gaskell syndrome). The disease mainly affects the digestive tract and is characterized by reduced gut motility, although other signs associated with loss of autonomic function, such as mydriasis, urine retention or dry mucous membranes, may also be evident. Histopathological changes are seen in the autonomic ganglia. Chromatolysis-like degenerative changes take place in the neurons. Dysautonomic disease is well documented in the dog, cat Figure 8 .7 Lateral view of the abdomen of a rabbit with an impacted caecum. This radiograph was taken with the rabbit conscious. Gas has collected within the caecum and outlines several large pieces of impacted caecal material. Further impacted material can be seen in the caudoventral abdomen. In some cases, hard pieces of impacted material (caecoliths) can obstruct the colon as they are moved into the large intestine (see Figure 8 .8). Like gastric impaction, impaction of the caecum can be the result of stress. The rabbit had recently been abandoned and, as a result, was subjected to the additional stresses of transport and rehoming. In this case, treatment was successful (see Section 8.7). A lateral view of the abdomen of a 4-year-old neutered male rabbit that suffered from periodic bouts of anorexia and abdominal distension is shown. In the interim, the rabbit had a good appetite but suffered from chronic diarrhoea. The stools were voluminous and contained a mixture of indigestible fibre particles and bacteria. Hard and soft faeces were indistinguishable. The rabbit was fed on a high fibre diet consisting of mainly grass hay with a small amount of goodquality mixed ration. Vegetables appeared to exacerbate the problem. Blood samples showed a mild anaemia and hypoproteinaemia. Bouts of tympany responded to treatment with analgesics and oral trimethoprim/sulpha combinations. The rabbit was eventually euthanized. Post-mortem examination revealed a large (2-3 times normal size) flaccid caecum. Histopathological examination of the caecum and intestines showed lymphoplasmacytic enterotyphlocolitis suggestive of an immune-mediated aetiology. The author has seen several similar cases in which dietary modification and oral prednisolone has been prescribed, in addition to other treatment, with a limited degree of success. A similar radiological picture can be seen in cases of caecal obstruction, which results in gas distension of the caecum. The cause of the obstruction is usually a large impacted lump of caecal material (caecolith) or a neoplasm such as a lymphoma. The cause of the obstruction can sometimes be seen radiographically or ultrasonographically. In cases of caecal obstruction, there is not the history of large loose voluminous faeces in association with a good appetite.",

In recent years, dysautonomia has been described in rabbits suffering from mucoid enteropathy. Cheeke (1987) observed that a strain of nonalbino white rabbits with pigmented eyes were particularly susceptible to diarrhoea and that evidence of 'insufficient nerve ganglia in the intestine' was seen. An analogy with grass sickness in the horse was made. The discovery of degenerative changes in ganglionic neurons in rabbits suffering from mucoid enteritis had been made as early as 1967, but was not investigated further, although a syndrome of caecal impaction in conjunction with pulmonary oedema and urine retention was described by several authors (Van der Hage and Dorrestein, 1996) . In 1991, postmortem examination of two sick hares found on an English estate where horses had died from grass sickness revealed changes in the ganglia and alimentary tract that were remarkably similar to those seen in grass sickness (Griffiths and Whitwell, 1993; Whitwell, 1991) . Van der Hage and Dorrestein (1996) described the clinical findings, pathological lesions and microscopic and transmission electron microscopic features of the coeliac ganglia of 19 rabbits with mucoid enteropathy. Typical cases were selected that had died following a disease characterized by emaciation, respiratory distress, distended abdomen with a palpable obstipated caecum or a distended bladder. Degenerative changes, manifested as chromatolysis, were found in the coeliac ganglia. No viruses, infectious agents, aflatoxins or other causative agents were discovered on food analysis or on extensive examination of the liver and intestinal contents of affected animals. An analogy was again made with grass sickness in horses, which is thought to be caused by a neurotoxin.",

Detailed post-mortem examination is required to confirm the diagnosis of dysautonomia, which can be expensive. Most cases of mucoid enteropathy are not presented to veterinary surgeons for treatment and there is a great deal of confusion among rabbit breeders about the condition. 'Mucoid enteropathy' is a term used in a nonspecific manner to describe a number of inter-related enteric diseases that occur in rabbits, especially around the time of weaning. It should perhaps be viewed as a non-specific response of the rabbit gut to various challenges. Rabbit breeders will often cull and dispose of ill animals themselves. Caecal impaction in connection with pneumonia, and perhaps other autonomic signs such as bradycardia, dilated pupils or urine retention, is suggestive of dysautonomic disease. A feature of confirmed cases in the UK has been the presence of an inhalation pneumonia, as affected rabbits have problems swallowing and may have uneaten food in the mouth and pharynx (Whitwell, personal communication) .",

Many lay people and rabbit breeders use the terms 'mucoid enteropathy', 'ME', 'mucoid enteritis', 'mucoid enteritis complex' interchangeably to describe any enteric condition of rabbits characterized by diarrhoea, mucus production, constipation or death. These signs are non-specific and can be caused by several diseases. 'Mucoid enteritis' has been the cause of significant losses in commercial breeding units, with reported mortality rates of approximately 5-10% but rising to over 60% (McLeod and Katz, 1986) . Colibacillosis, enterotoxaemia, Tyzzer's disease, coccidiosis and viral enteritis can all occur concurrently with mucoid enteropathy, and can obscure the classical signs. The syndrome often affects young rabbits especially around the time of weaning, although adult animals can be affected. 'Mucoid enteropathy' is characterized by the presence of large amounts of mucus in the colon and is usually associated with impaction of the caecum (see Figure 8 .9). Inflammatory changes are minimal. The term 'constipative mucoid enteropathy' or CME can also be used to describe this syndrome. At post-mortem examination, the caecum is often impacted with dried contents and gas (see Figure 8 .10). The colon is distended with gelatinous mucus. The stomach and small intestine may be distended with fluid and gas.",

It is not known what role diet, stress, pathogens, caecal microflora or dysautonomia have in the disease, although it seems likely that all these factors could be implicated. Mucoid enteropathy is a disease of intensively reared domestic rabbits rather than wild ones (Lelkes and Chang, 1987) . The disease is occasionally encountered in adult pet rabbits, especially after a stressful incident such as transport or parturition. It is known that increasing the amount of indigestible fibre in the diet of newly weaned rabbits significantly reduces the incidence of mucoid enteropathy. Stress appears to play a major role in the development of the disease. Enzyme deficiencies, infectious agents and enterotoxins have all been cited as other possible causes. Inflammation is not a feature of the disease and intestinal hypomotility or changes in the acidity of the caecum have been proposed as aetiological factors (Lelkes and Chang, 1987) . Investigations are often hampered by the presence of concurrent infections such as coccidiosis, Tyzzer's disease or opportunist pathogens such as Clostridium spp. or E. coli.",

Incorporating the nerves and blood vessels in the ligature increases the likelihood of inducing a mucus hypersecretion 3-5 days after surgery (Hotchkiss and Merritt, 1996a) . Surgical removal of the caecum does not result in mucus production, whereas filtrates from the ligated caecum administered to in vitro sections of colon do stimulate mucus secretion. Injection of oxytetracycline into the ligated caecum prevents colonic mucus secretion, suggesting that a bacterial secretory product is the stimulus for excessive goblet cell secretion characteristic of mucoid enteropathy. Hotchkiss and Merritt (1996b) postulated a blood-borne factor (termed mucus-stimulating substance or MSS) is present that binds to receptors on goblet cells causing mucus release. Serum from rabbits suffering from ME causes increased mucus secretion when applied to Sipunculus nudus, a mucus-secreting coelomate. Mucus secretion is also stimulated in the respiratory tract. Injections of cholestyramine into the ligated caecum can prevent the development of mucoid enteropathy-like symptoms, suggesting the presence of some type of toxin (Toofanian and Targowski, 1983) .",

In these circumstances, the individual rabbit is valuable to the new owner and treatment is often requested. However, the prognosis is poor and most cases die despite aggressive treatment.

Intensive, damp, dirty conditions predispose to coccidiosis and the environment can become heavily contaminated. The disease is caused by a protozoan parasite with a complex life cycle. Coccidia strains are highly host-specific. Infection is by ingestion of sporulated oocysts passed in the faeces of infected rabbits. The oocysts require 48-70 h outside the host in which to sporulate. The oocysts are very resistant in the environment and can be spread through feed, soil and fomites. Wild rabbits can be affected and, theoretically, are a potential source of infection to pet rabbits that are fed on grass. Long grass picked by hand is less likely to be contaminated than short grass grazed by large numbers of wild rabbits. The protozoan parasites that cause coccidiosis are Sporozoa belonging to the suborder Eimeriorina. Eimeria are parasites of epithelial cells. They invade the mucosa of the intestine, colon and caecum and the epithelium of various ducts. Infected rabbits void oocysts that require oxygen and a period of a several days to become infective. Ingestion of the oocyst releases sporozoites into the duodenum after the oocyst has been broken down by digestive enzymes. The sporozoites invade cells and cause tissue damage as they complete their complex life cycle, ultimately to release oocysts into the lumen of the gut. Eimeria spp. are host-and site-specific. Oocysts can survive for many years in the environment but are susceptible to dry conditions. Recovered rabbits become immune to infection. As many as 14 species of Eimeria have been described in the rabbit. All but one species are found in the small intestine, caecum or colon and cause 'intestinal coccidiosis'. One species, Eimeria stiedae, inhabits the epithelial cells of the bile ducts and causes 'hepatic coccidiosis'. There is no crossimmunity between the different Eimeria spp.",

The developmental stages are restricted to the ileum and jejunum but, in heavy infestations, overspill into the caecum has been observed (Owen, 1992) . There are two asexual stages and oocysts appear in the faeces 7-8 days post-infection. Mixed infections can occur and coccidia are often found in conjunction with other pathogenic agents such as E. coli. It is not always clear how important intestinal coccidiosis is during an outbreak of enteritis, although the introduction of a pathogenic species into a susceptible population can prove fatal, especially in young rabbits around the time of weaning. Acute infection causes inappetence, weight loss, depression and diarrhoea that can be haemorrhagic. Intussusceptions may be associated with chronic infections.

Wild rabbits can be infected and transmission occurs by the ingestion of sporulated oocysts in food that has been contaminated by faeces. Sporulation of the oocysts is required for infectivity and requires at least 2 days outside the host. Oocysts are extremely resistant and can remain viable in soil, on vegetation and fomites for long periods of time (Harkness and Wagner, 1995) . Recently, voided faeces do not contain oocysts that are infective (Harkness, 1997 ) as a prepatent period in the presence of oxygen is required for development. Eimeria stiedae has a slightly different life cycle to the intestinal Eimeria spp. Ingested oocysts hatch in the duodenum and sporozoites penetrate the intestinal mucosa before being transported to the liver, either in the bloodstream or in macrophages in the lymphatic system. Replication takes place in the mesenteric lymph nodes before transport via the hepatic portal circulation to the liver where they enter bile duct epithelial cells. Here the life cycle is completed with the ultimate release of oocysts into the bile duct. The prepatent period lasts for 15-16 days and oocysts are found in the faeces for at least 10-14 days after this (Owen, 1992) .",

Treatment of established disease can be problematic, as rabbits that are not eating well will not receive the medication in the feed. Medical treatment must be combined with suitable cleaning and disinfection procedures in order to be successful. In a comparative study of the response of rabbits infected with E. stiedae to treatment with sulphaquinoxaline, robenidine, methyl benzoquate, clopidol and a mixture of methyl benzoquate and clopidol, only sulphaquinoxaline and the combination of methyl benzoquate and clopidol gave satisfactory control of the parasite (Joyner et al., 1983) . Toltrazuril (Baycox, Bayer) in the drinking water is highly effective in reducing oocyst output of intestinal and hepatic Eimeria spp. A regimen of 2 days' treatment repeated after 5 days reduces clinical signs and allows the development of immunity (Peeters and Geeroms, 1986; Redrobe et al., 2010) .",

            "text": "Enterotoxaemia occurs in rabbits kept in colonies and occasionally in the individual pet rabbit. The disease is caused by Clostridium spp. that are anaerobic Gram-positive bacilli capable of producing powerful enterotoxins. The organisms can reside in the gut without causing disease but under certain conditions will rapidly proliferate and cause a severe enteritis. Clostridium spiroforme is a major pathogen in rabbit enterotoxaemia, although Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens may also be involved (Perkins et al., 1995) . Pathogenic rabbit strains of C. spiroforme are different from non-pathogenic strains in other species. A similar pathogenic strain has been isolated from humans affected with diarrhoea (Carman, 1993) . Rabbit isolates of C. spiroforme produce a toxin that is neutralized by antiserum to C. perfringens type E iota toxin. Virtually all rabbit isolates of C. spiroforme are toxigenic, although this is not the case in other species. Clostridium difficile produces two exotoxins, toxin A and toxin B. Toxin A is a lethal enterotoxin that binds to specific enteroreceptors and induces fluid secretion, mucosal damage and intestinal inflammation. Toxin B is a potent cytotoxin that interacts synergistically with toxin A (Perkins et al., 1995) . In intensive situations, the mortality rate from enterotoxaemia can be high due to the prevalence of pathogen in the environment. Low fibre, high carbohydrate diets are associated with enterotoxaemia in commercial units. Recently weaned rabbits are most susceptible. Young rabbits do not digest and absorb starch as efficiently as adults (Blas and Gidenne, 1998) and carry a greater risk of unabsorbed carbohydrate reaching the caecum to act as a bacterial substrate. Substantial amounts of glucose are required by C. spiroforme for toxin production. There is a marked difference in starch digestibility between adult and growing rabbits. In adult rabbits, carbohydrate is hydrolysed and absorbed before it reaches the caecum. Enterotoxaemia in adult pet rabbits is not associated with a high carbohydrate diet but usually follows a disruption of the gut flora by antibiotics, other pathogens, toxins or stress. Experimentally, enterotoxaemia can be induced by oral administration of clindamycin. The accidental inclusion of lincomycin in the diet of commercial rabbits has resulted in clinical outbreaks.",

Salmonella typhimurium or Salmonella enteritidis can cause diarrhoea, septicaemia and rapid death. 8.10.6 Viral causes of enteritis 8.10.6.1 Rotavirus Rotaviuses are enveloped RNA viruses that are particularly associated with diarrhoea in young animals. They are host-specific. Rotavirus has been associated with outbreaks of enteritis, usually in rabbits under 6 weeks of age. In most cases, diarrhoea is mild (Thouless et al., 1996) . Rotavirus was originally isolated from weanling rabbits with diarrhoea, although it has also been recovered from unaffected animals Digestive Disorders 8 (Bryden et al., 1976) . Serological tests have revealed that rotavirus infection is widespread in colonies of domestic rabbits. The disease has been reported in many parts of the world, including Japan, Europe, Canada and the USA (DiGiacomo and Mare, 1994) . In infected colonies, adult animals are seropositive and confer maternal immunity on their offspring. The young rabbits become infected when maternal immunity wears off, which coincides with weaning. Infected rabbits shed virus in faeces, which is probably the main route of transmission, although there is evidence for airborne spread. Severity of clinical signs depends on virus strain, intercurrent disease, immune status and all the other factors involved in enteric disease in weanling rabbits. In a study by Thouless et al.

Professional veterinary advice is seldom sought except when a disease threatens all the stock, a prizewinning bloodline or perhaps a particularly valuable individual. Expense is always an issue. Cases of enteritis can be difficult and expensive to investigate and treat. Prompt, detailed post-mortem examinations and laboratory investigations are required. The causes are often multifactorial and home visits to examine the stock and assess the husbandry may be needed. Successful treatment of individual rabbits with enteric conditions is difficult and usually expensive. Intensive therapy, including intravenous fluids, hospitalization and nursing, is required despite the breeder's expectation that some 'wonder drug' will provide an instant cure. Therefore compromises must be made and general principles applied to prevent further losses. Post-mortem examination is extremely valuable and all dead rabbits should be examined, Digestive Disorders 8 not just one or two, as soon after death as possible. Microscopic examination of impression smears, gut contents and faeces can be a cheap way of obtaining information.
