This study aimed to review cases of MERS-related events, such as development of MERS-like symptoms or exposure to patients. Methods: A MERS screening clinic (MSC) for HCP was setup in the National Medical Center during the MERS outbreak in 2015. Clinical and laboratory data from HCP who visited the MSC were retrospectively reviewed. Additionally, these data were compared with the results of postoutbreak questionnaire surveys and interviews about MERS-related symptoms and risk-related events. Results: Of the 333 HCP who participated in MERS patient care, 35 HCP (10.5%) visited the MSC for MERSlike symptoms. No one was infected with MERS, and the most common symptom was fever (68.6%) followed by cough (34.3%). However, 106 of 285 postoutbreak survey participants experienced at least 1 MERSrelated symptom and 26 reported exposure to patients without appropriate personal protective equipment, whereas only 4 HCP visited the MSC to report exposure events. Conclusions: Although a considerable number of HCP experienced MERS-related symptoms or unprotected exposure during MERS patient care, some did not take appropriate action. These findings imply that for infection control strategy to be properly performed, education should be strengthened so that HCP can accurately recognize the risk situation and properly notify the infection control officer.",

            "text": "The largest outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outside the Middle East occurred in South Korea in 2015. During the outbreak, 186 patients were confirmed to have MERS, of which 37 died. 1,2 Isolated strains were typed as clade B MERS-coronavirus (CoV) and were closely related to the viruses circulating in the Middle East. 3 The distinct feature of the MERS outbreak in South Korea was that the transmission was hospital-related, with transmission within the hospital and from hospital to hospital, resulting in the exposure of a high number of health care personnel (HCP) to MERS-CoV. 4 In general, HCP form a considerable proportion of confirmed MERS cases as observed during previous outbreaks. In the 2014 outbreak in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, 81 of 255 patients (31%) were HCP. 5 In the 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea, 30 of 166 confirmed patients (18%) were HCP. 6 A number of HCP reported several symptoms compatible with CoV infection during a MERS outbreak 5, 7, 8 ; this raises concerns about nosocomial spread and loss of competency in the medical service. Hospitals have instituted screening clinics for HCP with symptoms suggestive of CoV infection during outbreaks. The World Health Organization and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed a guide to determine who is eligible for MERS-CoV evaluation. 9, 10 Typically, MERS-infected individuals seek medical care for symptoms such as fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, and myalgia. However, several asymptomatic cases or patients with minimal symptoms have been reported. 11, 12 The National Medical Center (NMC) was a designated institution for MERS patient care during the 2015 outbreak in South Korea. A total of 30 of 186 confirmed MERS patients were referred to the NMC from May-July in 2015. During this period, the NMC instituted a screening clinic for HCP involved in MERS patient care to ensure rapid detection, isolation, and management of HCP who were possibly infected with MERS. The aim of this study was to review the HCP who visited the screening clinic for MERS-related symptoms or exposure events. Additionally, we compared the data of this HCP group with the results of the postoutbreak survey and interviews focusing on the overall HCP population that participated in MERS patient care.",

            "text": "In this study, 35 of 333 HCP visited the MSC for MERS-like symptoms when caring for 30 patients with confirmed MERS. In the postoutbreak questionnaire survey, however, 52 of 285 (18.2%) HCP answered that they experienced fever during the MERS outbreak. Additionally, 24 HCP did not take any action, despite unprotected exposure to MERS patients. Although there may have been a recall bias about exposure events as has been previously reported, 14 our study findings imply that HCP may not behave as they are instructed by the hospital authority during an outbreak situation. As previously mentioned, none of the MSC visitors was infected with MERS during the outbreak. The serosurvey conducted after the end of the MERS outbreak, targeting all HCP who participated in MERS patient care, revealed no positive cases, despite one third of HCP answering that they experienced MERS-related symptoms during the MERS outbreak. A previous study conducted in Saudi Arabia reported that even though respiratory symptoms developed in 10 (21%) of 48 HCP who were exposed to MERS patients, none of them showed evidence of MERS-CoV infection; the number of symptomatic HCP exposed to MERS was lower than the number of symptomatic HCP without reported exposure (33%). 15 Similarly, in a contact investigation of the first imported MERS patient into the United States, all 61 identified contacts had negative test results for MERS-CoV, even though some had face-to-face interactions or prolonged exposure to the index patient, including aerosol-generating procedures. 14 Other than the studies targeting groups who had contact with MERS patients, a study of 490 cases of suspected MERS in the United States confirmed 2 (0.4%) cases of MERS infection, and both of them were HCP from MERS-prevalent areas. 16 The most common detected pathogens in the 490 suspected cases were influenza A virus and rhinovirus-enterovirus. However, a recent study reported by another centwe in South Korea revealed that 4 of 58 symptomatic HCP contracted MERS (6.9%) and 3 of 196 asymptomatic HCP (1.5%) were infected with MERS; this was despite the HCP being aware of the patient's infection with MERS-CoV and wearing PPE (ie, surgical gloves, surgical gown, eye shield, N95 respirator). 17 Specifically for the MERS outbreak in South Korea, most transmissions happened from patients with active pneumonia while they were staying in the hospital for treatment, rather than in the community setting. 4 Early identification of patients with an infection risk and vigilant monitoring are crucial to minimize the risk of transmission. Our institution focused on instructing HCP to notify the infection control officers as soon as they experienced MERS-like symptoms or exposure to a patient without appropriate PPE during the MERS outbreak. However, a substantial proportion of HCP did not take appropriate action, such as visiting the MSC, despite experiencing MERS-related symptoms or potential exposure. During the in-depth interview about exposure events, most HCP stated that the reason for not notifying the infection control officer was that by their judgment, the patient was not infectious when the exposure occurred. Although the actual risk of infection was very low in most exposure events, it is not recommended that the HCP determine the infectivity of a quarantined patient by themselves. In addition, one HCP replied that she tried to obtain a sputum sample through oropharyngeal catheter suction from a patient with poor sputum expectoration capacity. Although she was aware that it might provoke coughing, she only wore an N95 respirator against the recommendation of using PAPR during the procedure, which may cause aerosol generation. During the in-depth interview, she replied that she was reluctant to notify the event to the hospital authority worried about the limited HCP capacity during the outbreak situation. Although abiding by the infection precaution is most important, HCP should be educated to notify hospital authorities promptly if unprotected exposure occurs.",

Therefore, the risk of unrecognized exposure may have been minimal and the actual situation may be different according to the role of an institution during the outbreak situation. Second, our data regarding the MSC are based on the HCP who visited the MSC. As observed in our postoutbreak survey, some HCP may not have visited the MSC even though they had experienced MERS-related symptoms. Third, although most HCP replied that the reason for not notifying their exposure event to the infection control officer was that they judged the patient as not infectious, we could not determine the actual infectivity because most HCP could not recall the involved patients. However, despite these limitations, there was no evidence in the postoutbreak serosurvey that HCP had been infected with MERS during patient care in the NMC. We think our experience may be helpful for developing strategies in the situation of an emerging infectious diseases outbreak.",
