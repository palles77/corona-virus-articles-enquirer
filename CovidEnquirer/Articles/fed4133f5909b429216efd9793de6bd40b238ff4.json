Except for the findings mentioned above, her physical exam was unremarkable. Laboratory studies revealed leukopenia (2.5 \u00c2 10 3 /ml), anemia (11.3 g/ dL), and thrombocytopenia (100 \u00c2 10 3 /ml). Antibody testing revealed positive direct antinuclear antibodies (1186 AU/ml), positive Antistreptolysin O titer (310 IU/ml), positive Epstein-Barr virus immunoglobulin IgG antibody (3186 AU/ml), positive Ehrlichia chaffeensis IgM (1:60) and IgG (1:512), and positive human granulocytic ehrlichiosis IgG (1:512) by indirect fluorescent antibody. Of note, IgM titers for Epstein-Barr virus and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis were negative. Human granulocytic ehrlichiosis testing was also negative. In the presence of multiple positive serologies, laboratory data, and some clinical features, the patient was presumptively treated for ehrlichiosis with a 14day course of doxycycline. At a 4-week follow up, repeat Ehrlichia chaffeensis IgM and IgG titers were further elevated (1:1024 and 1:2048, respectively) and retreatment with minocycline was initiated. Due to drug intolerance the patient discontinued the treatment. A urinalysis revealed 3 \u00fe protein; 24 h urine protein measured 0.6 gm/day and in the following week increased to 1.7 gm/day. A renal biopsy was performed.",

Cognitive dysfunction, headache, mood disorder, cerebrovascular disease, seizures, polyneuropathy, anxiety, and psychosis may also occur. On exam, patients with ehrlichiosis display a maculopapular rash and hepatomegaly. Lymphadenopathy is observed in less than 25%. Malar rash or discoid rash and symmetrical oligoarticular arthritis are seen in SLE. Lymphadenopathy is frequently observed; however generalized lymphadenopathy is rare. Laboratory findings in ehrlichiosis include positive serology, thrombocytopenia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (in severe ehrlichiosis). In SLE, positive serology, leukopenia, lymphopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia have been well described.",
