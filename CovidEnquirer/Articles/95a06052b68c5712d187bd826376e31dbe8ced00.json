The ATE medium, which contains chicken embryo extract and fetal bovine serum, supports the growth of ciliated cells, goblet cells and basal cells from chicken tracheas on fibronectin-or matrigel-coated dishes. Non-epithelial cells make up less than 10% of the total population. We further show that ATE cells support the replication and spread of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Interestingly, immunocytostaining revealed that basal cells are resistant to IBV infection. We also demonstrate that glycosaminoglycan had no effect on infection of the cells by IBV. Taken together, these findings suggest that primary ATE cells provide a novel cell culture system for the amplification of IBV and the in vitro characterization of viral cytopathogenesis.",

For instance, avian metapneumovirus (MPV), which primarily attacks the respiratory tract, replicates inefficiently in embryonic eggs. Diagnosis of MPV infection is mainly dependent on the detection of viral RNA or viral antigens, but not viral isolation [5, 6] . In addition, to investigate the epidemiology of avian influenza viruses (AIV) requires efficient and sensitive viral detection and amplification system for comprehensive collection of the viruses from waterfowl and migratory birds [17, 31] . However, the wildbird isolated AIV are usually mildly or nonpathogenic to chicken embryos [20, 26] and the efficiency of viral isolation is often unsatisfactory in embryonated eggs [11, 19] .",

The environment of the viral replication may also selectively modify the original cell tropism and pathogenesis of the isolated virus [15, 25] . It has been shown that a serially embryo-passaged of infectious bronchitis viruses (IBV) M41 strain exhibited significantly attenuated pathogenesis within the oviduct compared to the parental strain [7] . In addition, egg-mediated epitope alterations in amplified isolates might attenuate the protective efficiency of these viruses when used to vaccinate against the challenge of a wild-type virulent strain [16, 24] . For instance, after egg adaption, human influenza A virus, originally showing a2-6 sialic acid tropism only, exhibits increased hemagglutinin (HA) binding affinity to a2-3 sialic acid-containing gangliosides due to amino acid substitutions in the vicinity of the receptor binding site of the HA protein [8, 15] . For primary viral isolates, providing natural host cells for replication might eliminate the selection pressure of an exotic growth environment and avert the alteration of cell tropism and consequent genomic mutations.",

In addition, the global profile of mRNA expression in the cultured cells showed that cytokeratin 14 (K14), a basal cell marker, was highly expressed. However, the protein expression of cell-type specific markers and the existence of mucin-secreting goblet cell are not well-characterized. In this study, we developed a novel culture system to isolate, amplify and passage chicken tracheal epithelial cells in an efficient manner. The avian tracheal epithelial (ATE) cell types were identified using immunocytostaining, and the ratio of cell types is statistically illustrated. We further demonstrate that primary ATE cells support IBV replication. The susceptible cell types and the effect of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) on IBV attachment to ATE cells was also investigated.",

Forceps were used to force the outflow of detached cell sheets of tracheal epithelium from the tracheal lumen. The epithelial cells were harvested and further digested with collagenase I (1 mg/mL, Roche) for 5 min at 37\u00b0C. The cells were gently pipetted, and the tissues were homogenized into small cell clumps. FBS was added to the digesting solution to stop the reaction. The cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min to remove residual digesting enzymes. The cell pellets were resuspended in ATE medium, containing 10% FBS (Invitrogen), 10% chicken embryo extract (CEE) (US Biological, Swampscott, MA, USA; or self-made [27] ), 1% glutamine (Invitrogen), 0.1 mM b-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 1% nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) in DMEM-F12 medium (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded on 2% matrigel-or 20 lg/mL fibronectin-coated 24-well or 96-well plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA). When the cells reached confluence, the cultured cells were passaged by digestion with both 0.01% (w/vol) protease (type XIV, Sigma-Aldrich) and 2.5 U/mL dispase I for 5 min at 37\u00b0C.",

The optimal cell matrix for ATE cells was evaluated; both 2% matrigel or 20 lg/mL fibronectin efficiently promoted cell attachment, but gelatin, collagen I, collagen IV and laminin were less effective (data not shown). The primary culture system for mammalian tracheal epithelial cells is well-established. To culture the ATE cells, specialized commercial media for the tracheal epithelia of humans and rats were first tested (described in the Materials and methods section). None of them supported cell growth or long-term viability of ATE cells. Adjustment of the concentration of retinoic acid, a differentiating factor for tracheal epithelial cells [10] , did not affect attachment or cell growth of ATE cells. Increasing FBS from 10% to 20% in the culture medium modestly enhanced the viability of the cells (data not shown). We speculated that unidentified chicken nutrients essential for the promotion of ATE cell growth were absent in the culture medium. CEE, an essential supplement for the culture of mouse neural crest stem cells [27] , was added to DMEM-F12 medium with 10% FBS. We found that CEE significantly improved cell growth and reduced cell death of the primary ATE cells (Figs. 1B and 1C) .

Figure 5A shows that both H and DS at 7.5 lg/mL effectively blocked JEV infection in BHK-21 cells, as previously reported [28] . Complete inhibition of JEV infection was achieved when the concentrations of H and DS were elevated to 30 lg/mL. Although low concentrations of HS and CS did not affect JEV infection, a modest neutralizing effect was observed when the concentrations of HS and CS were elevated to 30 lg/mL. In contrast to the JEV results, even when all of the tested GAG were applied at 2.0 mg/mL, no significant inhibitory effects were observed on the infection of primary ATE cells by TW2575/98 (Fig. 5B ). In addition, the GAG did not alter the cell tropism of IBV on cilia cells or goblet cells (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that the binding affinity of GAG for IBV is too low to interfere with viral entry into tracheal epithelial cells. In this study, we showed that primary ATE cells exhibit the same cell composition as tracheal epithelia and can be passaged and amplified in a convenient and efficient way. These cells support IBV viral replication and viral release, providing an ideal system to amplify respiratory viruses and characterize their pathogenesis.",

            "text": "In studies of tracheal infection, ciliated cells and goblet cells have been shown to be the major target cells of IBV [1, 22] . Our results with primary ATE cells also showed that IBV viral protein can be detected in both ciliated cells and goblet cells. This cell tropism may account for the pathogenesis of IBV, such as the ciliostasis in observed IBV-infected TOC and the reduction of sialic acid secretion [3, 22] . In addition, we are the first to demonstrate that IBV does not appear to infect K14-positive basal cells. In an uncomplicated IBV-infected chick, clinical signs such as gasping, coughing, tracheal rales and nasal discharge persist for only 5-to-7 days and disappear within 2 weeks [3, 22] . In the recovery stage, unaffected basal cells may be responsible for epithelial hyperplasia after desquamation of the ciliated and goblet cells and reconstruction of the epithelium of the injured respiratory tract to reestablish normal physiological functioning [12, 13, 22] . The insensitivity of basal cells to IBV infection also suggests that coinfection with other viral or bacterial pathogens is required to disrupt basal membrane integrity and cause hemorrhage in IBV-infected tracheas. At present, quantification of the virulence of IBV is still a problem [3, 22] . Measuring ciliostasis in TOC is not a sensitive approach for determining the severity of respiratory tract injury caused by IBV infection [21] . In addition, different species of chicken may also vary in the vulnerability of their respiratory tissue to IBV infection [2, 22] . In our ATE system, IBV shows high affinity for ciliated cells and goblet cells. Cell tropism, viral replication and viral spread can be determined and quantified by immunocytostaining, suggesting that ATE cells could serve as a quantitative platform to determine the pathogenesis of IBV. It has been shown that sialic acid and HS may help IBV bind to its receptor on the cell membrane of target cells [18, 32] . Receptor binding triggers endocytosis and delivers the viral genome into the cytosol through pHdependent membrane fusion [4] . In this study, we demonstrate that none of the tested GAG interfered with IBV binding to ATE cells. Further investigation is required to test whether this ineffectiveness is due to a lack of the XBBXBX H consensus sequence in the S protein sequences of TW IBV.",
