In 2008 Sichuan earthquake, 68,712 people lost their lives; 17,921 people were missing; more than 370,000 people were injured; about 150 million homeless people were in need of shelter and more than 450 million people were affected by this great earthquake. During this large-scale disaster relief operation, 5257 professional rescuers, 13,434 firemen, about 38,000 medical personnel and more than 130,000 volunteers implemented the whole emergency response (Ning, 2009; Waugh Jr, 2003) . In addition to these rescuers on site, millions of people were involved in organization, coordination, transportation of material and the wounded. Currently, most of the knowledge of emergency management exists in unstructured data like documents (Pogrebnyakov & Maldonado, 2018; Ragini, Anand, & Bhaskar, 2018; Simon, Goldberg, & Adini, 2015) . For different stakeholders, right information from distributed sources can be integrated and transferred by a knowledge-based system.",

Commonly, emergency management Dwivedi, Shareef, & Mukerji, 2017; Sinha, Kumar, Rana, Islam, & Dwivedi, 2017) includes four phases: mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery. Emergency response is one of the most important parts in the planning system of China (Liu, 2011) , and was invested in with considerable resource by governments worldwide (Perry & Lindell, 2003) . In this paper, we will study the knowledge model for emergency response.

The second one is about how to respond to these loss situations. Beyond doubt, emergency plans contains the integrated blueprint of how to handle incidents (Hoogendoorn et al., 2005) , which is the combination of theories and experience. If professionals have a knowledge-based system built on past lessons, it would effectively assist management teams in emergency response (Arain, 2015) . Furthermore, it can lead to a better understanding of the works that should be done if rescuers can compare actual situations (first type) with the theory model.

The first one focuses on the theory topics like logic, reasoning, retrieval (Sutanto, Liu, Grigore, & Lemmik, 2018) , and so on, while the second one investigates the application of the knowledge engineering. Obviously, there has been considerable interest in the former one to date. However, there are a lot of practical problems such as knowledge fusion, knowledge sharing and so on (Gupta, Altay, & Luo, 2017; Hwang, Lin, & Shin, 2018; Prasad, Zakaria, & Altay, 2016; Wamba, Edwards, & Akter, 2017; Wang, Huang, Davison, & Yang, 2018) . Although the first kind of technology can inform us of how to represent knowledge, it is far from enough to know what will be needed before the stage of knowledge representation. As a result, besides representing and retrieving knowledge for emergency response, an important work in this paper is to reveal knowledge structure of real contingency planning system.",

As a result, more than depicting what exists, the key of the conceptual model is to represent a view of what could exist (Gregory, 1993) . Without a novel point of view, it is inevitably getting lost in the oceans of data. In the process of deduction, if one of key feature of a system can be included by big premise, with rational logic the whole model can offer a perspective of this system. And the deduction may be a novel way to construct the conceptual models.",
