The safety and immunogenicity of one or two doses of a recombinant A (H1N1) 2009 influenza VLP vaccine was evaluated in a two-stage, Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 4563 healthy adults, 18-64 years of age, during the H1N1 2009 pandemic in Mexico. In Part A, 1013 subjects were randomized into four treatment groups (5 g, 15 g, or 45 g hemagglutinin [HA] VLP vaccine or placebo) and vaccinated 21 days apart, with sera collected on Days 1, 14 and 36 for hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) testing. After review of safety and immunogenicity data from Part A, additional subjects were immunized with a single dose of 15 g VLP vaccine (N = 2537) or placebo (N = 1011) and assessed for safety in Part B. Results showed the H1N1 2009 VLP vaccine was safe and well-tolerated. Systemic solicited events were similar between placebo and VLP vaccinated groups with no vaccine-related serious adverse events. Dose response trends for solicited local adverse events were observed, with higher incidences of local pain, swelling, tenderness, and redness reported in the higher VLP dose groups (15 g and 45 g) compared to the placebo and 5 g VLP groups following both vaccinations. Although the majority of local AEs were mild in severity, a dose trend in events of moderate or greater severity was also noted for these solicited events. The VLP vaccine groups demonstrated robust HAI immune responses after a single vaccination, with high rates of seroprotection (\u226540 HAI titer) in 82-92% of all subjects and in 64-85% of subjects who were seronegative at the time of immunization. HAI geometric mean titers (GMTs), geometric mean ratios (GMRs) and seroconversion rates were also all statistically higher in the VLP groups compared to placebo for both post-baseline time points. Based on these data, additional clinical trials are in development to evaluate influenza vaccine candidate antigens manufactured using Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9)/baculovirus-based VLP technology.",

The influenza HA, NA and M1 genes are synthesized and cloned into baculovirus, which is then used to infect Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells. The virus-encoded proteins are expressed within the cells, assemble and bud off as virus-like particles mimicking the virus structure expressing the relevant epitopes in a particle empty of any viral genetic material [3] .",

            "text": "A novel influenza A (H1N1) triple-reassortant virus with swine, human and avian genes was first identified in April 2009 as the cause of human respiratory disease in Mexico. By June 11, 2009 , there were almost 30,000 confirmed cases reported in 74 countries and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an influenza pandemic [12] . WHO and the United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like virus be used as a monovalent vaccine during the 2009 pandemic as well as for the 2010-2011 flu season [13] . Results reported at a WHO meeting in 2010 indicated the pandemic influenza H1N1 2009 vaccines elicited potentially protective antibody responses in a high proportion of older children and adults within 2 weeks of administration of a single dose of vaccine [14] . Efficacy studies of H1N1 2009 inactivated vaccines have confirmed these vaccines are protective and that hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) seroprotection predicts prevention of influenza infection and illness. For example, a study in China of over 95,000 children and adults immunized with a split-virion A (H1N1) 2009 vaccine was 87.3% effective in preventing confirmed influenza infection in school-age children [15] . In spite of this success in the development of an immunogenic and efficacious pandemic influenza vaccine, the first doses of H1N1 2009 vaccines were not available in the US until October 5, 2009, 5 months after the epidemic had reached the US and Mexico, where the pandemic was first recognized in April 2009. Mexico did not obtain a licensed vaccine to start its own vaccination program until November 27, 2010 , which was at the end of the second pandemic wave and after most of the 72,000 confirmed cases and 1300 deaths had occurred [16] . The August 2010 report by the US President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology reviewed the US response and concluded that a vaccine made by recombinant DNA technology using genetic sequences should be a priority for development as the technology could potentially reduce the time required to supply vaccine should another influenza pandemic occur [1] . Thus, clinical evaluation of the safety and immunogenicity of an insect cell-produced influenza VLP vaccine will be an important step towards achieving this goal.",

Comparable safety and immunogenicity results in adults administered a single injection have been published for this strain with inactivated subvirion vaccines [19, 20] . The current study population had a relatively high rate of preexisting immunity (HAI titer \u226540 rate: 36-41%) for a novel pandemic strain. Baseline H1N1 pandemic strain seroprotection rates of 30-33% was reported in the Australian population [19] . Consistent with other studies, we found no measurable cross reactivity with other pandemic strains in our study (data not shown) suggesting strain specific immunity. As the sera sampling occurred at the end of the second wave in Mexico, the data suggests that this novel H1N1 pandemic strain exposure established a relatively high rate of subjects with high HAI titers in the general population in a short period of time. The strain specificity provided an opportunity to evaluate the VLP vaccine immunogenicity in a relatively na\u00efve population. A sub-analysis was performed to evaluate the immunogenicity of the vaccine in the seronegative population (no measurable HAI titers to H1N1 at baseline), as an indicator of the VLP vaccine's immunogenicity. As shown in Table 3 , responses in this population were robust as indicated by a 79% seroprotection rate achieved after a single 15 g dose.",

            "text": "Extensive deployment of licensed vaccines during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic occurred and the immunogenicity results were also robust [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . The immunogenicity appeared to translate into clinically significant levels of vaccine efficacy, especially in the young. In a very large study, Chinese school children immunized with a single 15 g dose of a monovalent split-virion vaccine resulted in an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 87.3% (95% confidence interval, 75.4-93.4) [20] . A large multicenter case-control study, based on medical practice-based active surveillance for medically attended culture-confirmed H1N1 pandemic influenza-like illness (ILI) in multiple European countries, in all ages using multi- Table 4 Immune response as measured by the microneutralization assay (MN). Parameter ple vaccines, estimated vaccine efficacy at 71.9% (95% CI 45.6-85.5) [28] . Adjuvanted vaccines achieved up to 100% vaccine efficacy in children [29] , but were accompanied by high rates of fever and local side effects. Additionally, in some studies the data indicated that HAI titers correlated with protection [19, 30] . The announcement of the pandemic in Mexico created a public health crisis and initiated widespread efforts to manufacture appropriate vaccine. The licensed egg-based vaccines were effective, but deficiencies in vaccine availability due to limitations of this manufacturing technique hampered efforts to have a major impact on the disease incidence [1] . Although the insect cell produced VLP vaccine is in development, a manufactured lot of insect cell recombinant VLP influenza H1N1 vaccine was complete 12 weeks after release of the relevant sequence by the CDC. The data presented in this study indicate that the vaccine is highly immunogenic, even in the seronegative population, and was well-tolerated in a large and placebo-controlled study. The expectation by public health authorities that a transmissible, highly pathogenic pandemic virus will emerge remains a threat, and delivery of effective and rapidly available vaccines continue to be an important development priority. Results of this study suggests that the insect cell derived VLP should be further developed as a candidate influenza vaccine [21] . In support of this objective, additional clinical trials are in development to evaluate influenza vaccine candidate antigens manufactured using Sf9/baculovirus VLP technology.",
