In HBoV2-positive patients, co-infection was high (70%), with RSV being the most common co-pathogen. Primers SN1 and SN2 were designed to detect the NP1 gene in the 10 HBoV2-positive patients. However, only 4 gave positive results, which occurred because of the low PCR sensitivity with this pair of primers and because the NP1 gene of HBoV2 is divergent, as described (6) . Furthermore, as previous studies (6, 12) pointed out, potential recombination upstream from the NP1 gene may explain the lower detection. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the NS-1 region of the HBoV2 strain (LZ480 and LZ578) clustered closely with that of the HBoV2 PK-2255 strain (FJ170279), and the NP-1 region clustered closely with that of the HBoV2 W153 strain (EU082213), suggesting potential recombination in the HBoV2 strains ( Figure) .

Two of 3 patients with HBoV2 monoinfection had diarrhea with no vomiting (Table 1) , and only 1 of 10 patients who were HBoV2 positive vomited. Further investigation is needed to exclude oral or inhaled gastric viruses as possible sources of NPA-associated HBoV2.

The phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbor-joining method using MEGA 3.1 (www.megasoftware.net), and bootstrap values were determined for 1,000 replicates. Bootstrap values >50% are shown at the branching points. Human bocavirus (HBoV) and HBoV2 reference sequences are indicated by circles and squares, respectively. Bovine parvovirus (BPV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and human parvovirus B19 (B19) reference sequences are indicated by inverted triangles. Scale bars indicate nucleotide substitutions per site.
