China is a major contributor to the worldwide infectious disease burden because of its population size. The association of China with the rest of the world through travel and trade means that events in the country can aff ect distant populations. The ecological interaction of people with animals in China favours the emergence of new microbial threats. The public-health system has to be prepared to deal with the challenges of newly emerging infectious diseases and at the same time try to control existing diseases. To address the microbial threats, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, the government has committed substantial resources to the implementation of new strategies, including the development of a real-time monitoring system as part of the infectious-disease surveillance. This strategy can serve as a model for worldwide surveillance and response to threats from infectious diseases.",

However in 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic struck, bringing the country to a standstill. The attention of the entire country and indeed the world focused on the control of this infectious disease. Many questioned the readiness and openness of China to confront an infectious disease epidemic. Since the SARS epidemic, interest in the emergence and control of infectious diseases in China has been renewed.",

Reports from hospitals to the public-health system were delayed and incomplete. On April 24, 2003, during the SARS epidemic, local CDCs were required by the ministry of health to report daily (through a secured website) the number of cases in their jurisdiction. A month later, on May 24, 2003, local hospitals were required to submit information on SARS cases with this same web-based system. This reporting system provided policy makers with essential and up-to-date information on the epidemic and it showed the usefulness of information technology in disease control.",

The ministry of health took note of the successful use of modern information technology during the epidemic and built the world's largest internet-based disease reporting system, called the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention (CISDCP). The CISDCP had two important improvements compared with the previous reporting system. The fi rst is that diseases were reported in real time. In the past, hospitals and clinics would submit case-report forms to their county or district CDC; local CDCs would submit report summaries once a month up the chain to the national CDC. With the CISDCP, hospitals and clinics immediately and directly reported through the internet. This innovation allows public-health offi cials to have real-time information on diseases so they can immediately identify disease outbreaks and implement any needed containment strategies.",

To address this diffi culty, the Ministry of Health developed a surveillance and response system for pneumonia of unknown cause, in which reporting through the CISDCP is required. Pneumonia was selected because airborne pathogens, such as the SARS coronavirus, highly pathogenic avian infl uenza, or human infl uenza are most likely to cause a major rapid disease epidemic. Once a patient's profi le meets the clinical, radiological, and laboratory criteria of pneumonia of unknown cause, hospitals are required to report the case within 24 h and, if necessary, take immediate action to contain the spread of the disease. Once the national CDC identifi es a case of pneumonia of unknown cause through the CISDCP, active contact with the provincial and lower-level CDCs and hospitals ensures that the case is properly diagnosed and managed, and that appropriate measures are undertaken to contain the disease.",

Most of these cases were not linked to known avian infl uenza outbreaks in poultry or birds, so the surveillance system played a key part in their identifi cation. For the 21 cases, the average time from symptom onset to report in the CISDCP system was 9\u00b75 days and a further 10 days to confi rm the presence of human avian infl uenza infection. Confi rmation of a disease would lead to a reporting delay of at least 10 days, which could have led to further disease transmission. Although much more work is needed to further improve this surveillance system, initial results are encouraging. If an infl uenza pandemic were to begin in China, this surveillance system could identify clusters of pneumonia of unknown origin in real time, thereby providing Chinese health authorities and the rest of the world with early warning of the start of the pandemic.",

Several provinces have some of the highest rates of this form of tuberculosis in the world, and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis has also been reported. 50, 51 Inappropriate prescribing of antimicrobial drugs by health-care providers and the incorrect intake of drugs by patients contribute to the development of drug-resistant microbes. Increased eff orts will be needed to educate health-care providers, patients, and their family members to address these diffi culties.
