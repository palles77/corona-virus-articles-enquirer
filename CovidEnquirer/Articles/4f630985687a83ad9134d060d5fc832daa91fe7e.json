The Working Group, consisting of experts from academia, industry, national regulatory authorities and national control laboratories, reviewed the latest issues of safety, efficacy and quality of YF vaccines and agreed that (i) the revision should focus on live attenuated YF vaccine virus 17D lineage; and that (ii) nonclinical and clinical guidelines for new vaccines prepared from 17D lineage be developed.",

He reminded them that yellow fever (YF) is a disease of major public health importance in Africa and South America and that there are still outbreaks, such as those recently in Paraguay. In countries at risk, vaccines of assured quality are essential for routine immunization and mass campaigns. He emphasized the importance of this consultation in view of the adverse events including yellow fever vaccine-associated neurologic disease (YEL-AND) and yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD) that had occurred in the past few years. A cluster of adverse events had occurred after a mass vaccination campaign in Peru but an expert panel convened to investigate the reports has found no link to the vaccine production lot. However, they did recommend that the guidelines for YF vaccines be reviewed as it is over 10 years since they were published. Dr Wood also informed the group that YF vaccines are important in regulating international travel and that it is the only disease for which a certificate of vaccination is required for entry into some countries. The updates of the International Health Regulations (IHR) [1] increase attention to the need for such certificates. YF vaccines that have gone through the approval process established by WHO are on a published list but some vaccines are not listed and they therefore now need to go through the approval process before they can be used in the context of the IHR. The current Recommendations (formerly, Requirements) for YF vaccine were adopted in 1995 and published \u0b1d Disclaimer: This report contains the collective views of an international group of experts, and does not necessarily represent the decisions or the stated policy of the World Health Organization.

The activities of the QSS group within WHO include ensuring that all vaccines are of assured quality through regulatory guidance and the implementation of new WHO standards. Goals of immunization programmes include increasing and sustaining vaccine coverage, reducing morbidity and mortality through the use of vaccines of assured quality, and introducing new vaccines and vaccines from new manufacturers or with modified vaccine production. The strengthening of National Regulatory Authorities (NRA) is also important as NRA functionality forms an essential part of quality assurance of vaccines. The Expert Committee on Biological Standards (ECBS) has played essential roles in WHO's normative function, e.g. establishment of standards, both written and physical. Written standards are produced as a form of guidelines or recommendations and used for the regulation of vaccines worldwide and also for the prequalification of vaccines. The established written standards must be evidence-based and only experts in the field can provide the evidence. The written standards now include nonclinical and clinical issues. The work of ECBS is supported by an Expert Advisory Panel and Collaborating Centres including the WHO International Laboratory for Biological Standards at the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC), the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut (PEI) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).",

Once such standards are fully adopted by the NRAs and implemented into national regulation, they will be implemented into manufacturer's procedures and considered by National Pharmacopoeias who will, where appropriate, incorporate them into general or specific monographs. Dr Knezevic informed that WHO TRS 878 Annex 1 guidelines on cell substrates are under revision [3] .

He acknowledged that the expression of YF vaccine potency in IU was a great achievement over two decades of international collaborative efforts and that it was the first case for live vaccines. The first collaborative study on YF vaccine potency was undertaken in the early 1980s [4] and the use of a common preparation improved the reproducibility of the results of potency testing between laboratories. This finding was re-addressed twenty years later and an International Standard for YF vaccine for use in potency tests established [5] . The objectives of this May 2009 consultation were to: (i) initiate revision of the WHO Recommendations for YF vaccine published in WHO TRS No. 872 in 1998 [2] ; (ii) discuss scientific basis of setting manufacture and quality control specifications for YF vaccines; and (iii) develop regulatory expectations for evaluating nonclinical and clinical studies of YF vaccines.",

            "text": "Dr Rosamund Lewis from the Epidemic Readiness and Intervention team of WHO reminded the group of the history of YF when it had been endemic in the US and Europe and that now the zones of transmission are South America and Africa. In the mid-20th century, YF had declined dramatically in Africa following a number of mass vaccination campaigns and the decreasing number of cases of YF and success of the vaccine resulted in lack of interest in YF surveillance, and, as a consequence, immunization was progressively neglected. YF reappeared in the late 1980s in many African countries. Outbreaks occur with recurring periodicity depending on geographic location with frequent outbreaks in West Africa, outbreaks often separated by 4-7 years in South America, and rare outbreaks in East Africa. The Yellow Fever Initiative is a partnership working to prevent yellow fever epidemics across Africa and Latin America through preventive vaccination and emergency response. The objective of the Yellow Fever Initiative is to secure vaccine production capacity and to vaccinate people at high risk to boost population immunity. A stockpile of 6 million doses has been established as an emergency response capability, although routine vaccine supply may be diverted to emergency response if required. Vaccines supplied through the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) are WHO pre-qualified but not all producer's vaccines are prequalified. Procured vaccine is used and replaced annually. In addition to emergency response, routine infant immunization and preventive vaccination campaigns are being implemented for populations at highest risk. For routine immunization, children are immunized at 9 months of age in Africa and at 9 months (Brazil) and 12 months in the Americas. In Africa, no boosters are offered but preventive campaigns serve as catch-up to vaccinate those unreached by routine programmes. In Brazil, boosters are mandatory each 10 years in endemic areas. Country level risk assessments are performed, which consider the history of cases, the presence of the vector, and population immunity (recent vaccination) to select districts at highest risk. Funding support has included 103 million dollars from the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI), funds from the European Commission Humanitarian Aid (ECHO) for emergency response, and funds from the EU for surveillance. Vaccination strategies are adapted to country needs and vaccine supply. Vaccine demand has risen from 34 million doses in 2001 to 105 million doses in 2009. In the same period, theoretical vaccine supply tripled from 40 million to 115 million doses but production in 2009 was only 75 million doses due to presentations selected (fewer 50-dose vials). Surveillance of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) is also undertaken during preven-tive mass campaigns, but some countries have also established a regular system for continuous surveillance of AEFIs. Suspected serious AEFI cases reported per 100,000 persons vaccinated were 0.67 in Togo, 0.06 in Senegal, and 0.02 Mali. However, no case of serious AEFI has yet been classified as confirmed and there were no deaths or virological studies undertaken in these countries. Dr Lewis indicated that obtaining samples from potential AEFIs was complex but improving with experience. Dr Reinaldo Martins (Bio-Manguinhos) added that sample collection had been problematic in Brazil, but this was improved using collection kits for blood samples.",

Risks for vaccine recipients are low, but currently available data suggest that the rare cases of YEL-AVD are related to individual, genetically determined, and currently unknown host factors that regulate cellular susceptibility to the attenuated YF virus rather than reversion of the vaccine virus to a virulent phenotype.

However, the geographical dispersion of subjects makes it unlikely that this was related to their genetic background. The virus isolated from these individuals was sequenced and found to be vaccine virus with no evidence that it had mutated. The conclusions of the extensive investigations were that the adverse events observed were not vaccine batch-related or productionrelated even though it was vaccine virus that caused disease. There was no difference between this and other lots of vaccine suggesting there must be cofactors that lead to disease. The immune responses induced by 17D virus have been investigated in a large number of studies. Neutralization antibody is a correlate of protection. Although the actual mechanism of protection is not known there have been recent studies investigating the immune response induced by the vaccine [8] [9] [10] , including studies on T and B cells, but assays on neutralizing antibodies are still the gold standard; there is no internationally recognized protective neutralizing antibody titre. Querec et al. identified C1qB and ETIF2ak4 as a 90% predictor of CD8 + T-cell responses and TNFRSF17 (which encodes a receptor for growth factor BLyS-BAFF) as a 100% predictor of the neutralizing antibody response induced by the vaccine [10] . Although such studies on cytokines will help understand adverse events, they will not contribute to the quality control of vaccine.",

The range of potencies observed for 5-dose vial stored at the recommended temperature was 3.81-4.92 log 10 IU/human dose. For the 50-dose vial, the range is 3.56-4.39 log 10 IU/human dose and 3.28-4.11 log 10 IU/human dose in the thermostability test. These presentations contain different stabilizers. Batches from 2000 to 2009 had a mean titre >4.0 log 10 IU and the company considered that the minimum WHO requirement endorsed by ECBS in 2008 is therefore appropriate. A dose-response trial is being undertaken at Bio-Manguinhos and it should be helpful to establish the upper potency limit. Four thousand batches have been tested in the general safety test with no failures and the company recommends omitting this test from lot release testing. Dr Hokama also presented data on molecular detection of mycoplasma instead of a culture method. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection method has been validated on 286 samples with 100% specificity and sensitivity. The limit of detection for a PCR method used was approximately 3.1 colony forming unit (CFU), which is much lower than that of a culture method. Their current YF seed (993FB013Z) of 17DD strain was produced in 1999 and was derived from the secondary seed lot no. 102/84, which was used as working seed lot until 2000. Four vials of master seed remain, and 40 vials of the secondary seed. Working seed lot 993FB013Z comprising 12,861 vials is available and should last 19 years, assuming an annual production of 50 million doses. The molecular characterization of this working seed lot was performed in the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Department of Oswaldo Cruz Institute/Fiocruz by Dr Ricardo Galler. The full genome of the working seed lot 993FB013Z was compared with the genome of the seed lot 102/84. The derivation of the seed virus has been documented. SPF eggs are used in production and neurovirulence tests performed on the seed virus with lot no.102/84 included as reference virus [26] . The working seed was also tested in clinical trials [27, 28] , without evidence of viscerotropism.",

This vaccine is recommended for travellers from China. The seed virus originated from the Rockefeller Institute in 1942 and is derived from the 17D strain. The master seed was established after 51 passages in chick embryos. The seeds were tested for neurovirulence and immunogenicity as required in WHO Recommendations. They have different minimum levels for potency tests in mice and cells, namely 5.5 and 5.8 log 10 /ml, respectively. However the specification given in the product insert is 'each single human dose is 0.5 ml containing not less than 4.2 log PFU of live yellow fever virus'. The vaccine has a shelf-life of 24 months and it is stable with titres of 5.5-6.0 log 10 . Production in the new facility will result in an improved vaccine with lower ovalbumin content and single dose presentation. This vaccine is not prequalified as the functionality of Chinese NRA has yet to be approved through WHO NRA assessment. They may request the virus seed from WHO for production which would result in a new product. During discussion Dr Zeng indicated that the virus is ALV free and production is in SPF eggs.

They indicated that their data suggest that the IS is losing potency as the mean titre for the IS in 2004 was 10 4.52 PFU/0.5 ml and 10 4.39 PFU/0.5 ml in 2009. No other user has observed or reported such a loss of potency to NIBSC. The variability in titres of the IS is higher than with the Sanofi standard respectively 0.11 log compared to 0.06 log. Dr Gerentes did not consider an upper potency limit to be appropriate, because of the variability of the mean titer from a vaccine to another. However, an internal upper limit is essential for the follow-up of the consistency of production. As a consequence, it was suggested that this internal upper limit: (i) should be specific for each YF vaccine; (ii) has to be defined by the manufacturer according to its trend analysis of its product (mean titre in IU/dose + 3 standard deviations); and (iii) needs to be approved by the National Regulatory Authority. Dr Pascale Cottin (Sanofi Pasteur, France) then described safety issues and investigations on production lots produced over a 12year period from 1990 to 2002 [29] . These studies included viral plaque size distribution which demonstrated a consistent potency, homogeneity of the viral population and genetic stability. Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) estimation on the total viral load in the bulks was found to be highly homogeneous. This study reinforces the robustness of the process of production and the safety profile of Stamaril TM . Quality and manufacturing investigations have been routinely conducted since 2006 and no specific action has been taken for Stamaril TM to date. This investigation is undertaken in case of serious adverse event notification and involves review of batch records, non-conformities, changes, and technical complaints. The procedures also allow for the possibility of an evaluation of the retained samples (visual or physical testing). With respect to YEL-AVD, a total of 9 cases, 5 fatal and 4 nonfatal, have been reported in the pharmacovigilance database of Sanofi Pasteur since 1994. A fatal case of YEL-AVD in Spain was investigated regarding vaccine quality. There were no difference evidenced between this lot and other vaccines doses analysed in parallel in terms of potency, genomic titer or plaque size profile [30] .",

SPF eggs sourced from Germany are used in production. He emphasized the need to define good minimum potency and that the thermal stability test is important when vaccine is to be used in tropical areas. Only 1 vial of master seed (passage 233) produced in 1974 remains and there is a limited stock of the working seed lot produced in 1985 (passage 235). If there is to be an increase in production capacity, a new working seed is required and Dr Diatta asked whether a vaccine batch (passage 235) could be used as a vaccine seed lot if it was characterized according to the TRS recommendations. It was noted that this level is less than WHO seed passage level. He also queried which laboratories are able to undertake the animal tests and noted that if the tests were performed in a limited number of laboratories, there would be less variation. A WHO reference strain is also required to train staff on this test. He agreed that an upper limit of potency should be documented but queried how this could be determined.

The mean of 43 assays performed on the IS 99/616 from 2004 to 2009 was 4.3 IU/0.5 ml which was the same as that obtained in the collaborative study. Fifty-two batches have been tested for potency and thermal stability in assays in which the IS and in-house standard included.

AFSSAPS will continue to express potency as LD 50 until the European Pharmacopoeia and marketing authorization are changed but will use IHS to validate each assay and use periodically the IS to check standard deviations of IHS. Dr Morgeaux noted that the IS looks stable in their assays. They had, however, noted a decline in the titres of vaccine batches relative to both IHS and IS.

A national adverse drug reaction reporting system was initiated in the 1990s by doctors and hospitals with a passive reporting system and a new network is in place from 2009. He reported minor side effects in a peacekeeping force going to Sudan. Of 60 people immunized with both YF vaccine and inactivated JE vaccine, 9 (15%) had headache and fever. The only case report of a serious adverse event was in 2004 in a 60 year-old American Chinese [31] . He had previously had rectal cancer and chemotherapy in 2002 so may have been immunocompromised. The patient was discharged from hospital following recovery. No virological confirmation was obtained. At that time the virus seed Beijing 17D strain was compared with the WHO reference 17D virus strain. The strains shared 99% homology of the published sequence in Genbank database. A putative amino acid residue 173 of the Beijing strain E protein had a likelihood of reversion to wild-type Asibi virus (from isoleucine to threonine) and which may be associated with virulence. Specification and quality improvements have been implemented with the Chinese vaccine leading to a lower content of ovalbumin, <30 g/dose, a lower amount of impurity and single dose vials. In addition, tests for residual albumin and endotoxin in the final product will be performed. A candidate national reference vaccine is in preparation. Twenty three thousand ampoules are available with a titre of 6.76 log PFU/ml. This is a 1.0 ml fill with a coefficient of variation of 3.87% and residual moisture of 1.4%. It will be stored at \u221220 \u2022 C. The stability of this preparation at different temperatures appears to be very good. This needs to be calibrated against the IS.

Cell culture assays and molecular characterization would also be addressed and consideration given as to whether a virus strain or batch of vaccine might cause neurotropic or viscerotropic disease. Tests currently undertaken are in non-human primates for neurovirulence (histopathological studies) and viscerotropism (viremia). Neuroinvasiveness can be assayed for in 5-or 6-day old mice and a new small animal model for viscerotropism is being developed and was subsequently published [15] .

The Brighton Collaboration case definitions for YEL-AVD and other events should be used for describing adverse events once they are available. It was noted that WHO is preparing a new protocol for investigating serious adverse events following YF vaccination. It is hoped that the incidence of YEL-AVD and YEL-AND may be reduced through identification of factors that predispose individuals to these reactions.

Bio-Manguinhos had therefore initiated a doseresponse study in Brazil, with doses ranging from 250 PFU/dose to 60,000 PFU/dose. Dr Nicola Boschetti (Crucell Berna, Switzerland) described the bridging study undertaken on their YF vaccine following the transfer of production from the Robert Koch Institute to Crucell [35] . This vaccine is produced from the WHO strain of virus and Stamaril was the comparator vaccine. The aim of the study was to demonstrate non-inferiority of immune responses as well as monitoring safety. Flavimune was shown to be non-inferior to both YFV RKI and Stamaril regarding immunogenicity. No significant adverse events were observed. The genetic stability of the Crucell vaccine had been demonstrated by the sequencing of virus isolated from vaccine recipients by amplification of E protein gene in 6 out of 15 subjects. Sequence analysis demonstrated that these viruses were identical to the vaccine virus.",

Plaque phenotypes were studied to detect any phenotypic difference between populations but no differences observed. The potency of each lot was also tested by RT-PCR to determine viral load and this was also consistent. These data reinforced the stability of the virus used to manufacture Stamaril. Should Sanofi produce a new seed, it will be sequenced. For the future analysis of seed lots, there was a need to develop new models for monitoring viscerotropism and neurotropism. Dr Teyssou considered that, when a new working seed is developed, clinical trials are not needed provided that bridging characterization studies have been performed. Should mutations between master and working seed lots be observed, it is important to know whether these mutations lead to phenotypic alteration and affect immunogenicity.",
