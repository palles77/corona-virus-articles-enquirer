The epidemic of HIV in the general population and HCWs led to the development of universal precautions. Based on universal precautions, infection control practices are applied to all patients, regardless of known or suspected infectious disease status, and emphasize the prevention of any contact with blood or certain body fluids [2] . In veterinary medicine, there currently are not the same concerns about transmission of bloodborne pathogens to veterinary personnel. Indeed, the attitude toward blood contamination in veterinary medicine is somewhat cavalier. Nevertheless, it is critical to remember that new diseases are emerging at all times and that many of these new diseases are zoonotic. Just because there is minimal concern about bloodborne pathogens of horses at this point in time does not mean that there is no risk posed by exposure to equine blood now or in the future. It is prudent to ensure that adequate precautions be taken now rather than waiting for the infection of large numbers of veterinary personnel to stimulate change, as occurred in human medicine.",

The level of barrier protection required would thus depend on the risk of contact with body fluids of concern, the potential for splashing or aerosol exposure, the volume of fluid that might be produced, and the duration of exposure [1] . These same points are relevant in the veterinary context. Veterinary hospitals need to be aware of OSHA or equivalent rules to provide a safe workplace and avoid potential liability. Thus, the development of appropriate infection control protocols, including barrier precautions, is required. In general, consideration must be given to the route of pathogen transmission: contact (direct or indirect), droplet, airborne, common vehicle (eg, equipment, medical devices), and vector borne.",

Examination gloves that are clean but not sterile are often used when handling wounds, infected body sites, and animals known or likely to be shedding pathogens in body fluids from orifices or on their skin; however, widespread use of examination gloves and protocols regarding glove use are not common. At the Ontario Veterinary College Veterinary Teaching Hospital (OVC-VTH), a policy requiring glove use for any contact with equine patients was instituted in response to nosocomial and zoonotic transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Whether this has reduced the transmission of MRSA or other MDR bacteria at the OVC-VTH is under investigation. Objective data are not available to help develop glove use protocols for veterinary hospitals; however, it is reasonable to recommend that gloves be worn whenever there might be contact with nasal secretions; feces; or discharge from surgical incisions, draining abscesses, or wounds.",

All these factors must be considered when choosing a gown for use in a hospital (nonsurgical) situation. In particular, the ability to resist contamination during anticipated animal contacts, ease of use, and cost are important. The most likely problem in veterinary practice is poor resistance to liquids, especially under direct contact or pressure. In equine medicine, there is a greater likelihood of high-volume contact with fluids (ie, diarrheic horse) or direct contact with patient surfaces that would have moist secretions or excretions (ie, horse with nasal discharge rubbing against personnel). These types of high-risk situations must be considered when choosing an appropriate gown. Additionally, prolonged contact with potentially infectious patients, such as with 24-hour nursing care of neonatal intensive care unit foals, creates additional problems. If gowns do not cover the entire body (eg, gowns that do not cover the lower extremities) and hospital personnel are in prolonged contact situations with foals, the likelihood of contamination is high. Full body gowns may be more appropriate in these situations.",

Although MRSA is not considered to be spread via the airborne route, the main location of colonization of MRSA in hospital personnel is in the nasal passages, and hand-to-nose contact is frequent. Thus, mask use prevents direct contact between the hand and nose, thereby decreasing hand contamination or decreasing the risk of inoculation of the nose after contamination of the hands during contact with a horse.

Like most other infection control methods, barrier precautions are only effective if used appropriately, and poor compliance is an ever-present concern that can have a negative impact on the entire infection control program. Failure of barrier techniques may involve inherent weaknesses in the items used, inappropriate selection of items, inappropriate use of items, inadequate training of personnel, or the inherent inability of barrier precautions to prevent pathogen transmission completely in all cases. It is important that barrier items do not create a false sense of security. Barrier items are useful but by no means 100% effective at preventing transmission of pathogens. It is critical that veterinary personnel use all adjunctive infection control techniques (ie, hand hygiene) and not rely solely on barriers.

If they are moved, their feet should be picked out and scrubbed with an appropriate disinfectant (ie, 0.5% chlorhexidine) at the time they leave the stall. One person should follow behind the horse to collect and appropriately dispose of any feces, and any areas potentially contaminated by the horse or its body fluids should be sprayed with disinfectant.

Care should be taken to avoid clutter of potentially contaminated items (ie, barrier items, buckets, nasogastric tubes) outside the stall. The area around the stall entrance should be considered potentially infectious and disinfected routinely (at least three to four times per day). Attention should be paid to the pattern of water drainage from the stall and in the area. If water runs from the stall to the breezeway or runs down the breezeway past the stall, housing of potentially or known infectious animals in the stall may be inappropriate.

Horses potentially carrying respiratory pathogens that can be spread via the aerosol route should not be housed in general ward areas.

Paradoxically, some studies have shown that handwashing with plain soap may increase bacterial counts on the skin [35, 36] . Handwashing with plain soap before intravenous catheter placement was reported to be no more effective than no hand hygiene at reducing the incidence of catheter complications in human patients [4] .",

Studies evaluating handwashing frequency in HCWs have yielded disappointing results, with handwashing only occurring after 12.9% to 75% of situations in which it was indicated [30, 37] . In particular, physicians tend to have poor compliance with hand hygiene protocols [27] . Compliance with hand hygiene protocols is a major challenge for infection control programs. Reasons given for poor compliance with hand hygiene include lack of time, poor access to proper handwashing facilities, and skin damage from repeated washing [33, 38] . Skin damage from repeated handwashing is a definite concern in hospital situations. The frequency of dermatitis can be high in personnel who wash their hands frequently. One study reported that 25% of nurses evaluated had clinical signs of dermatitis and 85% had a history of skin problems [38] . Damaged skin is of particular concern from an infectious control standpoint because it can harbor greater numbers of bacteria than normal skin.",

Increasingly, hand hygiene guidelines are recommending the use of these products when gross contamination of hands is not present [33] . Most alcohol-based hand sanitizers contain 60% to 70% alcohol and may be in a gel or liquid form.

Additionally, alcohol-based hand sanitizers can easily be placed throughout the hospital at minimal cost. As well, individual use bottles can be dispensed to health care providers to keep on their person for ease of use even when wall dispensers are not in the immediate area.

Although much of the information obtained in human medicine can be applied to veterinary hospitals, care must be taken with direct extrapolation of human studies.

This would translate into the potential for greater contamination of the skin on hands of veterinary personnel who handle horses compared with human health care providers. Veterinarians typically wear gloves less commonly than their counterparts in the medical field, and there is a somewhat cavalier attitude taken toward hand contamination in veterinary medicine as compared with human medicine.
