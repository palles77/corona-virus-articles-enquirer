Our data showed that all CVA21-or EV68-positive patients identifi ed in this study had mild ARTIs. The VP1 nucleotide sequences of the CVA21 and EV68 strains identifi ed showed high sequence identity and were located in the same cluster in their phylogenetic trees, HEV-C and HEV-D, respectively ( Figure 2 ). Nucleotide identity among the CVA21 strains identifi ed was 95.6%-100% and that among EV68 strains was 92.3%-99.7%. However, the CVA21 and EV68 strains had low nucleotide identity compared with their prototype strains (CVA21, GenBank accession no. AF546702, 87%-89.2%; EV68, GenBank accession no. AY426531, 76.6%-78.9%). Alignment of the putative VP1 amino acid sequences of HEV strains with their respective prototype strains revealed a limited divergence; only 2 substitutions were found in CVA21, and 9 substitutions and 1 deletion was found in EV68 (data not shown). These fi ndings suggest that the CVA21 or EV68 strains were similar but are changing and diverging from their prototype strains.",

            "text": "Since isolation of these viruses, infections with CVA21 and EV68 have been rarely reported (9, 10 The reason for the high frequency of CVA21 and EV68 infections in Beijing is unclear. The EV68 strains identifi ed in this study are probably novel strains or genetic variants to which the population is immune. Moreover, the deduced amino acid identity of the EV68 strains with strains detected in children in Japan (GenBank accession nos. AB601872- AB601885) (5) was 89.4%-93.8%, indicating the possible co-existence of 2 distinct phylogenetic lineages of EV68 strains (13) . The emergence of new genetic lineages might be the reason for increasing activity of EV68 (5, 13) . Because the median age of CVA21-positive patients was signifi cantly lower than that of other HEV-positive patients ( Table 2) , we suspect that years of CVA21quiescence probably resulted in increased susceptibility of the younger population (11) . Outbreaks of classical HEVs tend to occur in several-year cycles (11) . We noted that CVA21 infections were concentrated in 2006 and 2008. However, because patients were not enrolled in our study after April 2010, our data on HEV circulation might be incomplete. Longer surveillance would be useful for determining the cycle of CVA21 and EV68 infections. Another limitation of this study is that samples were collected from outpatients but not hospitalized patients, which could bias the classifi cation of illness toward being mild. However, this study presents evidence that CVA21 and EV68 cause mild disease and fi lls a void left by other studies that included only hospitalized patients.",

We detected 21 cases of CVA21 during August-December 2006 and 8 cases during September-December 2008, which accounted for 41.2% and 26.7% of all cases of HEVs, respectively. A few CVA21-positive cases were also detected in March and during June-August 2007. EV68 was detected in only 11 samples collected during August-October 2006 and in 2 samples in August 2008 (Figure 1, panel B;",
