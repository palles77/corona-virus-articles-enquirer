Sanitation engineering and hygiene were being implemented to control infectious diseases associated with contaminated water, food, and waste (1) . Despite many past improvements, enormous challenges remain. Today, approximately 60% of all human pathogens and 75% of newly emerging pathogens are zoonotic diseases of animal origin (2) . Globally, one billion people lack access to potable water for drinking and domestic use. Foodborne diseases have taken on new dimensions due to international transport of foodstuffs, increasing demands for animal protein, and opportunities for spread of infectious diseases.",

Indeed, public health efforts have been so successful that the United Nations estimates that the planet will experience a substantial increase in the human population, which will reach 9.3 billion by 2050 and 10 billion by 2100 (4). These developments present new challenges to the public health community that could be considered even more daunting than those of the previous century. Growing population needs for food, land, water, and energy has placed unsustainable demands on the planet. This is a global public health problem.",

Almost five million hectares were slashed and burned in Malaysia in 1997 to clear land for pig farming. With their habitat lost, the local fruit bat population contaminated the fruit in trees near the pig farms with their urine and saliva. The pigs ate the fruit, became sick with the Nipah virus, and subsequently transmitted the disease to the farm workers. The outbreak killed 105 people, sickened 160 more, and cost the Malaysian government more than $450 million. There is still no vaccine or cure for Nipah virus, and the disease has spread throughout Southeast Asia (6) .",

The deadly E. coli 0104:H4 outbreak centered in northern Germany during May and June 2011 has devastated parts of the European agricultural industry, sickened thousands, and killed 32 people so far, highlights the need for interdisciplinary collaboration (9) . The source of this outbreak, which likely involved the contamination of food with bacteria, remains uncertain, but it is likely (based on precedent) that domestic livestock were the source of fecal contamination. Logically, veterinarians who understand animal husbandry would be engaged in the investigation of this outbreak. However, manpower constraints and competing interests stand in the way. Currently, there are only 71 accredited (by AAVMC standards) schools of veterinary medicine (10), and the number of graduates pursuing careers in public health does not meet global needs.",
