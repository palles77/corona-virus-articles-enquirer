The assay is based on primer-probe energy transfer, and the most important advantage of this is the relative tolerance towards mutations in the target-probe region. The primers and the probe were designed using an alignment of 235 Type 1 (including all subtypes) and Type 2 PRRSV strains. According to the alignment, multiple degenerations were included in the forward and reverse primers to enable the detection of all PRRSV strains deposited in the GenBank. Specificity was tested using 37 different PRRSV strains and eight other swine pathogen viruses. The detection limit was approximately 10 copies of RNA prepared from the Lelystad virus, a European Subtype 3 virus (Belarus strain Soz-8), and an American vaccine virus (Ingelvac MLV \u00ae ). One TCID 50 was the detection limit in the case of the cell cultured Lelystad virus and an American wild type isolate, respectively. The melting point analysis revealed melting point decrease, but no significant sensitivity and signal loss in the presence of numerous (up to five) target-probe mismatches, indicating the capability of tolerating even more mutations. The method was suitable for the detection and quantitation of phylogenetically divergent strains and can serve as a robust, high throughput tool for molecular diagnosis of the PRRSV.",

The latter is the keypoint of this assay, since PRRSV is one of the most variable and rapidly evolving RNA viruses. In a TaqMan assay when mismatch is present in the probe binding site, the probe is displaced rather than hydrolysed, and the quencher molecule remains in the close proximity of the reporter. This can lead to signal loss, reduced sensitivity, and possible false negative results. For the PriProET reaction a 5 exonulcease deficient enzyme is used for the polymerisation that will prevent the hydrolysis or displacement of the probe offering more stable fluorescence signal.",

The PriProET assay uses only one primerprobe set to detect the full range of strains of both genotypes by tolerating numerous mutations on the target-probe area. By using fewer oligonucleotides in the reaction mixture it will be less prone to primer and primer-probe dimerisation and aspecific annealing leading to loss of fluorescence signal and sensitivity. The T overhang added to the oligonucleotides on their labelled enhanced the level of the fluorescence signal during the reactions, thus increasing the sensitivity of the system. Previous results obtained with the reverse primer and probe without the overhang showed significant lower fluorescence. The possible explanation of this phenomenon is that since T is the smallest nucleotide, it causes weaker quencher effect then the others, enhancing both the FRET and the light emission of the acceptor chromophore.",

Although the exact number of mismatches can not be stated by the degree of the temperature decrease, according to the sequences deposited in the GenBank Type 1 and Type 2 strains can be differentiated prior to sequencing the amplicons. However the probe binding site is relatively conserved, and -especially it's 5 end -is characteristic of the PRRSV stains within a genotype (Type 2 strains have at least 4 mismatches due to a deletion and 2 conserved mutations), in the future it can not be excluded that Type 1 strains with 4, 5 or even more mismatches may arise showing same melting points as Type 2 strains.",

(2003) . The explanation of this finding might be the difference of the method of signal detection in case of the amplification and T m analysis. During the amplification the absolute fluorescence signal amount is measured, whereas in case of the T m analysis the degree of fluoresce change is calculated. In case of extremely low amounts of template RNA the absolute light signal might not reach the threshold level, whereas the signal change can be identified at the specific T m temperature, when the probe is displaced from the template.",

The melting point of the amplicon with five mismatches is high (66.8 \u2022 C), referring to a relative strong connection between the probe and the target genome. This might indicate that this PriProET method has the potential of tolerating even more mismatches in the probe binding site. The primer pairs contained multiple degenerations on the nucleotide positions that showed up to be variable on the multiple alignments. These properties enable the assay to detect broad spectrum of PRRSV strains, which, in our view, is the most important benefit of this diagnostic method.",
