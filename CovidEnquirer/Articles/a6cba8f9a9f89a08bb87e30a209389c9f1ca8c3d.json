The sequence of ACE2 in pigs 15 covered 2418 nucleotides and coded 805 amino acid (aa) residues. Sequence 16 homology analysis showed that the ACE2 sequence in pigs is highly conserved 17 among species at the nucleotide and amino acid levels. Genetic evolution analysis 18 revealed that ACE2 gene in pigs has the shortest genetic distance with that in goats 19 while residing in a totally different branch from that in zebra fishes. Analysis of 20 protein structure predicted that ACE2 protein is a transmembrane secreted protein 21 with high hydrophilicity, containing a signal peptide sequences locating between 1aa 22 to 17aa. The ACE2 fusion protein expressed (under the induction with 1.0 mmol/L 23 IPTG for 10 h) was of approximately 100 kDa and mainly existed in inclusion body.",

In the same 339 year, Donoghue et.al constructed a full-length ACE2 expression vector from the 340 cDNA Library of heart failure patients through transfection of CHO cells(Donoghue 341 et al,. 2000). The gene sequence was recorded by GenBank and numbered as 342 AF291820. Later, it was confirmed that ACE2 and ACEH were the same. In 2003, 343 Moore confirmed that ACE2 was the main functional receptor of the SARS 344 coronavirus(Li et al,. 2003).

RNA extraction and RT-PCR Total RNA was extracted by using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia CA), and RNA concentrations were determined by a ultraviolet colorimetry 94 (ThermoScientific, Wilmington, DE). One microgram of total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using two step reverse transcription inversion following the manufacturer's protocol. ACE2 mRNA expression were amplified by PCR with 97 \u03b2-actin as an internal control (Bt03279175); The amplification conditions of PCR reaction were 95\u00b0C for 5 min, 32 cycles of denaturation at 98 \u00b0C for 10 sec, annealing at 57\u00b0C for 15 sec, extension at 72\u00b0C for 30 sec, and finally an additional extension 100 step at 72\u00b0C for 10 min.
