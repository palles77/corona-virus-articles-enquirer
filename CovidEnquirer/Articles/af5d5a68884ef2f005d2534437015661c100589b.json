            "text": "The global dissemination of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the fatal clinical results of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) urge scientists and physicians to discover the most potent prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines to combat this deadliest scourge of human society. Live recombinant microorganisms have been used as vectors to develop vaccines for eliciting broad array of immune responses against HIV/AIDS. Antigens of HIV can be brought into live and replication competent or incompetent microorganisms by molecular technologies. Appropriate expression of such antigens can be achieved under suitable conditions. When these recombinant vaccines are introduced to mammalian host, multiple immune responses, especially cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) activity will be elicited against the products of HIV genes carried by the vectors. A number of live viral vectors including poxvirus (Ondondo et al., 2006) , alphavirus (Perri et al., 2003) , adenovirus (Vinner et al., 2006) , adeno-associated virus (Tatalick et al., 2005) , rabies virus (Tan et al., 2005) , measles virus (Lorin et al., 2004) , and vesicular stomatitis virus (Egan et al., 2004) have been used as potential vectors for the development of HIV vaccines. Early-phase clinical trials of some of these viral vector vaccines have performed in humans. In addition, recombinant bacterial vectors, such as Listeria monocytogenes (Rayevskaya et al., 2003) , Shigella (Xu et al., 2003) , Mycobacterium bovis BCG (Kawahara et al., 2002) , and Salmonella (Kotton et al., 2006) have also been investigated as potential vectors for the delivery of HIV antigens. Since bacterial live vectors can be produced with less cost and stored via lyophilization, they offer many advantages over viral vectors.",

Genetic backgrounds of this bacterium and types of virulence mutations have been well characterized. Recombinant Salmonella Typhi vaccines are quite easy to massively produce and store, which make these vaccinations economically more feasible and accessible. Recombinant S. Typhi has been used as oral typhoid vaccines and as live vector to deliver heterologous antigens that can stimulate mucosal, humoral, and cellular immune responses after immunizing animals via mucosal surfaces (Kotton, 2004) . Foreign antigens can be stably expressed in the bacteria either from its chromosome harboring the antigen gene or from a plasmid carrying the gene (Stephens et al., 2006) . We have previously constructed a S. enterica serovar Typhi strain carrying the nucleocapsid (N) gene of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) integrated into the bacterial chromosome, which could elicit efficiently immune responses in vaccinated mice (Luo et al., 2007) .",

It is widely accepted that CMI against internal viral proteins of HIV is essential for eliminating infected cells because these viral proteins are structurally important and rarely generate mutant epitopes (Sacha et al., 2007) . To induce durable and effective CMI responses, these viral proteins have to be endogenously synthesized to ensure their entering into proper antigen presentation pathway.

Chromosomal integration generally increases the stability of foreign antigens and protects them from degradation by bacterial proteases (Kotton, 2004; Williams and Szalay, 1983) . The Gag antigen expression (Fig. 3B) and Gag-specific CTL activity (one of the most important CMI responses) (Fig. 7) were detected in mice immunized with this vaccine strain. Cellular immunity may prevent virus from attacking new susceptible cells, while antibodies play important roles in the first line of defense. As for the development of HIV vaccines, the viral envelop glycoprotein gp120 has always been the immunogen of choice (Giri et al., 2004) . Since the HIV gp120 is responsible for attachment to susceptible cells and is analogous to the highly immunogenic, its specific antibodies are considered to be crucial in the initial rounds of the campaign against HIV infection. In addition to CTL response, this recombinant vaccine strain could produce gp120 protein in mammalian cells (Fig. 3) and stimulate gp120specific antibodies production in vaccinated mice (Figs. 4 and 5) . There is evidence that multiple immune responses against multiple viral antigens (at least two) would establish superiority effects in the development of HIV vaccine (Amara and Robinson, 2002) .",

The Gag protein is an inner protein that helps assembly of viral nucleocapsid with less B cell epitopes and less immunogenic compared to gp120. Unlike the gp120 protein expressed from the eukaryotic plasmid, the level of Gag protein expressed from S. Typhi chromosome is relatively low when introduced into mammalian host. Thus, less anti-Gag antibodies (IgG or IgA) were produced in our study. This result was consistent with other report, which also showed that Gag-specific antibodies were hardly detected (Breton et al., 2007) . However, since the sequences of Gag are more conservative than that of gp120, the cellular reaction against this important structural protein would be more crucial in the long-term host immune response against HIV.",

Thus, we chose intranasal immunization instead of orogastric immunization for the induction of mucosal and systemic anti-HIV immune responses in this study. It is generally agreed that orogastric route for live bacterial vectors may be inefficient because the gastrointestinal tract contains commensal bacteria, other microorganisms, stomach acid, proteolytic enzymes, together with food might interfere with vaccine uptake and suppress immune responses (Galen et al., 1997; Pickett et al., 2000) . In contrast, the nasal cavity surface provides a smooth environment that is replete with antigen-reactive lymphoid elements, including T cells, B cells, and a large number of cellular components involved in the induction of immune responses. Intranasal immunization could lead to the induction of distant mucosal immune responses (Ogra et al., 2001; Wu et al., 1997) . The genital, rectal, and oral sites are considered to be most important for induction of strong mucosal immune responses to block the invasion of HIV through sexual intercourse. gp120-specific IgA mucosal antibodies were detected in fecal washes (but not in saliva or vaginal secretions), which suggests that rectal immune response was elicited by the vaccine candidate. It has been reported that HIV infection rates were higher for homosexual injection drug users (34%) than for bisexuals (16%) or heterosexuals (13%) (Wolitski et al., 1992) . Thus, we considered that rectal secreted S-IgA was important in the development of anti-HIV vaccine, since rectal sex is quite common in homosexual population.",

However, the main purpose of this study was to test this vaccination strategy for the induction of broadly immune responses to multiple HIV antigens. On the basis of this platform we constructed, it is quite convenient to test antigens derived from other viral strains and evaluate the immune responses they might induce.",

Initial experimental results demonstrated that this Salmonella vaccine strain could elicit multiple immune responses, including humoral, cellular, and mucosal responses, in mice immunized intranasally with this vaccine strain. Compared to the common bimodal vaccine approach in which CTL and antibody responses are induced by the combination of a live recombinant vector (or a plasmid DNA) and a subunit immunogen, this recombinant Salmonella strain provides a relatively easier approach of single recombinant microbial vaccination. In addition, this vaccine strain can immunize via mucosal surfaces without the use of syringe injection, which would make this vaccination more acceptable from the patient's perspective. Thus, it would provide a new approach to the prevention of HIV/AIDS.",

The HIV-1 gag gene and Cm R gene carried by the plasmid were then integrated into the pilR and pilU loci of S. enterica serovar Typhi J341 chromosome through homologous recombination chromosomal segments to generate recombinant S. enterica serovar Typhi strain S. Typhi pilS \u2212 pilT \u2212 Gag + (bottom part). In this recombinant strain the expression of HIV-1 gag gene was under the control of the pilus promoter of the bacterium.",

Two weeks post-immunization, sera were collected from vaccinated mice and analyzed by ELISA using purified HIV-1 Env protein as antigen for the detection of gp120-specific IgG antibodies responses. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies were used as the secondary antibodies. The optical densities were measured at 450 nm.
