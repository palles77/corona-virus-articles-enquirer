            "text": "In recent years, many studies have reported potential associations between cytokine gene polymorphisms and the development, course, and outcome of sepsis, often with apparently conflicting results. The objective of this study was to investigate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 -31 T/C, IL-6 -174 G/C, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) -308 G/A, and interferon \u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) +874 A/T genes for their possible association with susceptibility to early onset sepsis (EOS) in Saudi newborn infants. A total of 205 newborn infants aged 1-2 days were consecutively enrolled onto the study having met the inclusion criteria (as per the research protocol). DNA was extracted from filter papers using the Chelex-100 method. The cytokines SNP were genotyping using Taqman 5' nuclease allelic discrimination. For cytokine measurements we used the commercially available Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit. Our results show that the circulating IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 were significantly (p < 0.001) elevated in EOS patients compared to suspected and sepsis-free control groups; and IL-1\u03b2 -31C, IL-6 -174G, TNF-\u03b1 -308G, and IFN-\u03b3 +874A alleles were associated with EOS in Saudi infants. In conclusion, analysis of cytokines concentrations and SNP for the four tested genes can be used as a predictor of sepsis outcome in newborns.",

            "text": "Sepsis is a host condition of systemic inappropriate inflammatory response to the invasion of microorganisms [1] . Although there are many advances in the development of antibiotics and there has been an explosion of knowledge about the inflammatory response, sepsis still causes one million deaths each year (42% in the first week of life) [2] . Currently, it is accepted that inappropriate host inflammatory responses or inappropriate defence mechanisms play important roles in the development of sepsis [3] [4] [5] . Cytokines play vital roles in the regulation of host immune response, and altered expressions of cytokines are proven to be involved in the development of sepsis [6, 7] . Several risk factors for sepsis development have been identified [6] , but the cause of basic differences in susceptibility between individuals and populations remains unclear [8] . In recent years, several groups have provided accumulating evidence indicating that the genetic background of the host influences the susceptibility and prognosis of sepsis [9] [10] [11] . Previous studies have suggested that the variations in the genes encoding cytokines are involved in the modulation of inflammatory responses and are responsible for inter-individual differences in the susceptibility to sepsis [5] . Recent, epidemiological studies suggest that some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the genes encoding inflammatory cytokines may influence the course and outcome of sepsis [5, [12] [13] [14] . Exploration of host genetic markers with prognostic value for sepsis might be helpful in managing the neonates who would be most likely to benefit from aggressive antibiotic treatment, and they put the challenges involved into perspective [15] . Therefore, identification of newborns that are at high risk of developing sepsis could help us develop some effective prevention strategies.",

The study of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, cytokines that are synthesised at the beginning of the inflammatory cascade, has given differing results. Some studies have reported an increase in the concentrations of these proinflammatory cytokines in systemic circulation in septic newborns [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , while others demonstrated similar or even lower levels in infected newborns compared to healthy newborns [21] [22] [23] [24] . Such discrepancies in results among different studies could explain the different outcomes of sepsis seen in neonates [25] . Therefore, the variable of clinical evolution of neonatal sepsis is related to the individual variability in cytokine production and intensity of inflammation [25, 26] , which may be due to the variation of the genetic background of the patients [27] .",

            "text": "Results of different published studies addressing the association between the SNP TNF-\u03b1 -308 and development of sepsis in adults and neonates are contradictory. One of the studies suggested that the TNF-\u03b1 -308A allele has been associated with increased susceptibility to septic shock and mortality from septic shock in adults [28] . However, this association has not been consistently observed [29, 30] . In a study by Hedberg et al. [31] the septic patients presenting the AA/GA genotypes had a mortality rate from sepsis that was three times greater than that seen among those presenting the GG genotype. Moreover, a meta-analysis study has confirmed an increased risk of sepsis in carriers of the A allele for the TNF-\u03b1 -308 G > A SNP [10] . Regarding IL-1\u03b2 gene polymorphisms, previous studies indicate that SNPs of IL-1\u03b2 may be associated with a poor prognosis from sepsis [32, 33] . However, other studies did not find any association between IL-1\u03b2 -31 polymorphisms and development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants [34] . On the other hand, genetic variation within the regulatory part of the IL-6 gene may affect the incidence and outcome of sepsis [35, 36] . An association of the IL-6 -174 genotype with sepsis in preterm infants has been reported. Harding et al. reported a higher incidence of the IL-6 -174 GG genotype in infants who developed septicaemia [37] . Similarly, Ahrens et al. reported that the IL-6 -174 GG genotype was more frequent in infants with sepsis compared to infants without infection [38] .",

We reported in a previous study that a high level of C-reactive protein (CRP) was associated with early onset sepsis (EOS) infection in neonates living in Saudi Arabia, and those babies carrying the A-allele were associated with high levels of circulating CRP [39] . Because IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 appear before CRP in EOS infection [16] [17] [18] [19] , such cytokine gene polymorphisms may provide useful biomarkers for the screening of patients at risk, as well as in the identification of those most likely to benefit from specific therapeutic choices [40] . Therefore, the primary aim of the current study was to investigate SNPs in the IL-1\u03b2 -31 T/C (rs1143643), IL-6 -174 G/C (rs1800795), TNF-\u03b1 -308 G/A (rs1800629), and IFN-\u03b3 +874 A/T (rs2430561) genes for their possible association with susceptibility to EOS in Saudi newborn infants. The second aim was to evaluate the association between such SNPs in gene promoter and the circulatory level of corresponding cytokines.",

Using Fisher's exact test, each SNP was tested to determine if the population under investigation showed deviation from genotype frequencies expected under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) proportions [46] . Tests were performed separately in the cases and controls. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess associations of genotype (independent variable).

Single nucleotide polymorphisms in cytokine genes may explain, at least to some extent, the variability of the clinical course observed in sepsis and infections. The majority of previous studies related to SNPs in sepsis were performed on adults [36] . However, data from neonate populations with sepsis are poor, and developmental differences that affect inflammation and immune responses make it difficult to extrapolate data from adult studies to newborn populations [8, 48] . The current study focused on analyses of SNPs in four genes (IL-1\u03b2 -31 T/C, IL-6 -174 G/C, TNF-\u03b1 -308 G/A, and IFN-\u03b3 +874 A/T) that may play a critical role in, or are associated with, inflammatory response and sepsis severity, in order to identify possible predictive mechanisms for sepsis risk stratification. Interleukin 1\u03b2 is thought to be one of the key mediators in the pathogenesis of sepsis syndrome [49, 50] . Data of the present study clearly showed that newborns with EOS had significantly higher serum levels of IL-1\u03b2 compared with suspected and sepsis-free groups. This finding supports previous studies that have demonstrated an elevated level of IL-1\u03b2 in plasma of septic neonates when com-pared with both healthy infants and infants with clinically suspected but not confirmed sepsis [17, 18] . Therefore, several studies have evaluated the role of this cytokine in the early diagnosis of neonatal sepsis [17] [18] [19] . In addition, our data clearly showed a significant association between IL-1\u03b2 CC genotype and higher concentration of circulating IL-1\u03b2 cytokine compared to heterozygote IL-1\u03b2 TC genotype. Also, the IL-1\u03b2 CC genotype and allele are associated with EOS as compared to suspected patients. Previous data indicates that SNPs of IL-1\u03b2 may be associated with a poor prognosis from sepsis [32, 33] . However, other studies did not find any association between IL-1\u03b2 (C3953T) polymorphisms and outcome of sepsis [34, 51] . Kang et al. [52] concluded that IL-1\u03b2-31 and IL-1\u03b2-511 polymorphisms are not associated with the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants. This discrepancy may be explained by differences in the definition of sepsis and its severity, studied IL-1\u03b2 SNPs, and in the general characteristics of the enrolled subjects, including ethnicity.",

Data from the present investigation clearly demonstrated that neonates with EOS showed a highly significant Table 5 . Logistic regression analysis of cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3) levels (pg/ml) in relation to cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3) genotypes polymorphism in the combined study population serum level of IL-6 compared to suspected and sepsis-free groups. This finding is in agreement with previous studies that reported that IL-6 is excessively elevated in septic neonates when compared with both healthy infants and infants with clinically suspected but not confirmed sepsis [17] . Many investigators have demonstrated that levels of circulating IL-6 correlate with severity of sepsis and may predict outcome [35, 49, 53, 54] . Interleukin 6 appears to be ideal for detecting early-onset neonatal infection with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity [18, 19, 55, 56] . Since IL-6 is a very early marker that appears before CRP, it may be useful in the monitoring of patients with high risk of developing infection. Genetic variation within the regulatory part of the IL-6 gene may affect the incidence and outcome of sepsis [57] . Our data showed that the IL-6 GG genotypes are associated with EOS when compared to suspected patients, and IL-6 -174G allele is associated with EOS. However, no significant association was found between IL-6 -174C allele and EOS. In addition, the IL-6 GG genotypes are associated with higher levels of circulating IL-6 cytokine compared to individuals carrying the heterozygous IL-6 GC genotype. This result is in accordance with previous studies suggesting that individuals with IL-6 -174C allele have significantly lower plasma concentrations of IL-6 [58] , and this allele is associated with reduced IL-6 plasma levels in newborns [59] . Bennermo et al. [60] revealed that the IL-6 -174G allele is functional in vivo with increased inflammatory response. Similar results were found by studies that included Caucasian infants and showed that there was a risk of neonatal sepsis associated with the SNP IL-6 -174 GG [37, 38] . However, contradictory results were seen by Reiman et al. [61] and Baier et al. [62] in studies that included very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants of different ethnicities; they showed that the IL-6 -174C allele was associated with increased incidence of sepsis. On the other hand, other studies did not detect any association between the SNP IL-6 -174 and neonatal sepsis [63] [64] [65] . Such contradictions in data between various studies could be attributed to the differences in study design, ethnicity, and gene-to-gene and gene-to-environmental interactions [8] . In our study, we reported that the IL-6 -174G allele is associated with higher levels of circulating IL-6 and EOS. Consequently, IL-6 gene polymorphisms G-174 > C could be predictors of risk of development and/or predictors of the severity of sepsis in the Saudi newborn population.",

            "text": "Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 is recognised as a primary mediator in the pathophysiology of sepsis and septic shock (reviewed in [66] ). Data from the current study showed that serum levels of TNF-\u03b1 were significantly higher in the EOS group compared to suspected and sepsis-free control groups. This result is in accordance with previous studies that demonstrated an elevated serum level of TNF-\u03b1 on day 1 of neonatal sepsis, and the role of TNF-\u03b1 as an early diagnostic marker in neonatal sepsis has been evaluated [16] [17] [18] [19] . With regards to the SNP in TNF-\u03b1 gene promoter, the data presented here indicate that patients who are carriers of the TNF-\u03b1 GG genotype and G allele are significantly associated with EOS patients, compared to the suspected group. Furthermore, individuals carrying the TNF-\u03b1 AA genotypes are significantly associated with lower levels of circulating TNF-\u03b1 cytokine, compared to individuals carrying the TNF-\u03b1 GA genotype. These results are in parallel with the findings of previous studies that have demonstrated a pattern of protection that was conferred by the TNF-\u03b1 -308 GA genotype against both sepsis mortality and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) outcome in a paediatric population [67] . Similarly, in the adult population, another study has found an association between SNP TNF-\u03b1 -308A allele and protection against ARDS [68] . However, several studies have reported an association between SNP TNF-\u03b1 -308 G/A and sepsis outcome in the adult and paediatric population [10, 28, 29, 31, 69] , while other studies did not show any association between the SNP TNF-\u03b1 -308 G/A and increased risk of sepsis [50, 65, 70] . Such discrepancies in results among different studies could be explained by the variations in study design, enrolled subjects, ethnicity, and gene-to-gene and gene-to-environmental interactions [8] . In addition, Azevedo et al. [67] speculated that -308 G > A and -863 G > A SNPs in the TNF-\u03b1 gene promoter seem to work in opposite directions, and could in fact reflect a different impact depending on age.",

            "text": "Data from this study clearly showed high serum IFN-\u03b3 levels in EOS patients, compared to the suspected and sepsis-free control group. High levels of IFN-\u03b3 could lead to side-effects such as tachycardia, myalgia, malaise, leucopaenia, and weakness [49] . Interferon \u03b3 enhances LPS-induced mortality and increases levels of LPS-induced circulating TNF-\u03b1 [68] ; consequently, anti-IFN-\u03b3 antibodies protected against LPS-and Escherichia coli-induced mortality [71] . In addition, IFN-\u03b3 was shown to be a mediator of TNF-\u03b1-induced lethality [72] . Therefore, IFN-\u03b3 could play an important role in sepsis development and outcome. Our results demonstrated that the IFN-\u03b3 AA genotype and A allele are associated with EOS when compared to suspected patients. There is a significant association between individuals carrying the IFN-\u03b3 AA genotype and the higher concentration of IFN-\u03b3. Individuals carrying the IFN-\u03b3 TT genotype are associated with lower concentrations of IFN-\u03b3 when compared to those carrying the IFN-\u03b3 AT genotype. The IFN-\u03b3 + 874A allele has previously been reported to be associated with some infectious diseases [73] [74] [75] . Recently, the IFN-\u03b3 + 874A allele has been shown to be associated with susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Individuals with IFN-\u03b3 + 874 AA and AT genotype had a 5.19-fold and 2.57-fold increased risk of developing SARS, respectively [76] . The mechanism by which the IFN-\u03b3 + 874A/T allele influences the sus-ceptibility to sepsis may therefore depend on its role in the regulation of IFN-\u03b3 production [44] .",

However, due to the small sample size of this study, the cytokine SNPs were not in the LD. Therefore, these results need to be confirmed by a large-scale multicentre prospective study and should be supported by data from other ethnic populations, with the hope that it could be used to develop an early predictor for the prognosis of sepsis in neonates.",
