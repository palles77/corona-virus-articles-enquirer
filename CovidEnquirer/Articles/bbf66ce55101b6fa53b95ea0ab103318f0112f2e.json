            "text": "Shackell's successful treatment of rabies virus in 1909 represents the first published account of preservation of an animal virus using a process that was an early version of freeze-drying (Shackell, 1909) . Prior to this, viruses were maintained by passage in animals. However, freeze-drying provided a way to maintain virally infected material over long periods of time with relative ease when compared to serial passage in a susceptible animal host. The first experiment to demonstrate that this method could provide long-term stability was reported for a bovine virus that had been freeze-dried in 1916 and was shown to be viable after being maintained at room temperature for 30 years (Fasquelle and Barbier, 1950) . Later, as mechanical freezers became more available, freezing viruses at -25~ or less was adopted as a practical and reliable method of virus preservation. Influenza virus-infected mouse lung tissue and yellow fever virus were successfully frozen at -76~ by Turner (1938) , and Horsfall (1940) , using Turner's methods, demonstrated successful storage of influenza, mouse pneumonitis, and canine distemper viruses. Following these early successes, viral repositories, diagnostic and research laboratories, and vaccine manufacturing facilities have relied on freezing and freeze-drying for preservation of viruses and viral vaccines.",

            "text": "The reasons for preserving viruses are similar to those for the preservation of other microorganisms and cells: successful preservation allows for long-term maintenance of consistent stocks and for reproducibility in the testing of viral samples and manufacture of vaccines. For example, field and clinical isolates need to be preserved for transport to testing laboratories; harvested virus from animals or cell cultures may not be processed immediately and require preservation until used. Viruses held to a low number of passages in animals or cell cultures represent a viral population that is similar to that found in nature, and freezing these pools guards against genetic mutations that may occur during subsequent passage. Aliquots of viral stocks frozen at a designated passage level can then be used for multiple and repeatable experiments with the same viral population. Furthermore, it is extremely important that consistency be maintained during the production of viral vaccines; new lots of final product can be prepared with frozen viral seed stocks that consistently reproduce the desired immunogenic and attenuation characteristics. For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) maintains aliquots of the original attenuated poliovirus strains developed by Dr. Albert Sabin in the 1950s. These aliquots are frozen and, when amplified properly and kept to the prescribed low passage level, should produce a vaccine today with the same properties that characterized the original Sabin vaccine. Similarly, viruses that are currently under development for use as vectors for gene therapy must be highly characterized and homogeneous for safe and effective use and need to be maintained as frozen stocks.",

            "text": "In order to better appreciate the requirements for freezing and freezedrying of human and animal viruses, some consideration must first be given to understanding the structural and functional organization of this diverse group of microorganisms. The classification of viruses is based on morphological and physiochemical properties. Thus viruses are divided into those with DNA or RNA genomes and further subdivided into families based on size and structural properties. There are 6 families of DNA viruses and 13 families of RNA viruses (see Table 1 ). The genomes of viruses within a given family are similar in terms of their polarity, genome organization, and method of replication and have morphologic features in common, including size, shape, nucleocapsid symmetry, and presence or absence of an envelope. Other characteristics that help to classify viruses include sensitivity to low pH, heat, and lipid solvents. Sensitivity to pH is determined by subjecting a virus to a pH of 3.0. Loss of titer greater than one log10 indicates that the virus is pH sensitive and acid labile. Heat treatment of a virus for 30 min at 50~ is a test of thermal stability. If the virus survives this treatment, with no more than a one log10 loss of infectivity, it is considered to be thermostable. Treatment with lipid solvents, commonly ether and Despite the similarities among the physical properties of these families of viruses, relatively few general rules for freezing or freeze-drying viruses can be made. For example, it is common to use membrane-stabilizing agents to preserve viruses with a lipid envelope. Picornaviruses, which lack a lipid membrane, maintain infectivity in the presence of MgC12. However, the optimal conditions for freezing specific viruses need to be determined empirically.",

            "text": "Significant reduction of morbidity and mortality for many viral infections has been accomplished by the successful application of viral vaccines. In the case of smallpox, eradication of this important human pathogen has been realized. Polio has now been targeted as the next viral disease that can be eradicated by immunization. Vaccine production requires the use of the \"seed lot system\" for consistent reproduction and quality control of vaccine lots. Vaccine virus seeds are usually frozen at two passage levels prior to vaccine lot production and these stocks of virus are designated the master seed and the production or working seed, respectively. Multiple aliquots of these seeds are prepared for reference as well as for characterization and standardized testing for possible contaminants. Finally, it is also important to distribute the storage of the master virus seed and working seed among multiple freezers in order to be assured of preserving part of the stock in the event of a mechanical failure. The seed lot system establishes a viral stock that can be standardized and provides a source of viruses so that vaccine lots manufactured over decades will be closely related to the original seed lot. This is especially important for live-attenuated vaccines that in most cases have been derived by multiple serial passage of a clinical isolate of a virus. Deviation from the attenuated passage number may result in undesirable phenotypic changes of the attenuated vaccine virus. This was the case with yellow fever vaccine when uncontrolled passage of this virus resulted in a vaccine with a higher than normal incidence of side reactions (Fox et al., 1942) .",

            "text": "Presently, researchers are using the tools of molecular biology to produce a new class of recombinant viral agents that will be used for immunization or genetic therapy. For example, mammalian retroviruses that integrate into the host cell genome are being developed as vectors for delivery of human DNA sequences. The newly acquired DNA is expressed in the form of protein(s) that may be deficient in the host cell or may require de novo synthesis. This form of genetic therapy has been demonstrated routinely in vitro and in vivo in animal experiments and is being proposed as therapy for some human genetic diseases (for review, see Roemer and Friedmann, 1992) . In addition, recombinant viral vectors are also paving the way for a novel type of therapy in which cancer cells can be specifically targeted for infection by a recombinant virus; following infection the inserted gene is expressed and the gene product selectively makes the infected cancer cells more susceptible to subsequent chemotherapy or to natural immune surveillance in the host (Collins et al., 1992; Culver et al., 1992) . Alternatively, recombinant vectors may express antisense RNA that can bind to and block the activity of the host gene sequences. Successful experiments of this kind require viral vectors that are thoroughly characterized and safe. Seed stocks of the recombinant viral vectors constructed to express the desired nonviral gene sequences must be frozen or freeze-dried in order to be preserved for future experiments and clinical trials.",

These include assays whereby viral cytopathology is measured in cell cultures or, when this is not possible, potency may be determined by inoculation of animals or eggs. By far the most accepted and accurate quantitative measure of viral infectivity is the plaque assay. Most viruses form plaques in susceptible host cells. Generally, after virus inoculation on suitably sensitive cell monolayers, an agar overlay is applied so that viral cytopathology is localized. After an incubation period, viable cells are stained with a vital dye, revealing areas of cell death, the plaque-forming unit. Most viral freezing and recovery experiments use the plaque assay to titer virus before and after treatment as a measure of viral activity. In this way, one can determine the efficiency of the freezing or freeze-drying process. Electron microscopy (EM) has also been used on occasion to visualize the effects of freezing and freeze-drying. These EM experiments are limited by the purity and titer of the viral preparation as well as the subjective interpretation of observations.",

Some viruses, e.g., herpes viruses, stay cell associated whereas other are readily released from the cell into the culture fluids. In general, viruses grown after passage in vivo require disruption of the infected animal tissue or organ by homogenizers or aerosol-controlled blenders. Diluent consisting of buffer or cell culture media is added for release of the virus into the aqueous phase during cell disruption. Depending on the virus, serum may be required as an additive to the diluent for optimal freezing ( Table 2 ). Viruses that are found in blood may be harvested and frozen directly in the serum after separation from blood cells or by cocultivating infected peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) with susceptible cell lines. These preparations may be frozen without further treatment, although it is generally recommended that serum or PBLs be frozen and thawed only once to achieve optimal virus recovery. Similarly, cell culture harvests may require disruption of the cell monolayer as a first step. Cells may be scraped from the culture vessel surface into the culture fluids or these fluids may be removed and the cells treated separately. In either case, cells are disrupted and virus is released. In certain cases, virus-infected cells are harvested for a seed preparation. Gentle scraping and harvesting of these cells into the culture fluids or into flesh buffer or cell culture medium is required. The specific details for optimal harvesting procedures for individual viruses may be found in the literature.",

Concentrations used for cell culturing and growing viruses range from 0.5 to 5% in cell culture medium.

Medium containing skim milk, calcium lactobionate, normal serum albumin, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), glycerol, or magnesium chloride promoted better freezing and freeze-drying recovery with a range of viruses, especially enveloped RNA viruses. Wallis and Melnick (1968) further demonstrated that DMSO or serum acted as a cryoprotectant for four different enveloped viruses, herpes virus, measles virus, Sindbis virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus. Under the conditions described DMSO performed somewhat better than serum as a cryoprotectant. The nonenveloped viruses, vaccinia, adenovirus, and poliovirus, did not require DMSO or serum for retention of viability during freezing. The authors concluded that enveloped viruses were similar to mammalian cells and that DMSO stabilizes the viral envelope much as it stabilizes the mammalian plasma membrane. However, another member of the herpes virus family, varicella-zoster (VZ), is especially sensitive to freezing and freeze-drying. Grose et al., (1981) used sucrose, potassium phosphate, sodium glutamate, and albumin in a cryoprotective \"cocktail\" for VZ virus. For both cell-associated and cell-free virus, the cocktail was fully protective, with 100% recovery of infectivity after freezing to -70~ and freeze-drying. Additionally, these authors found that glutamate and albumin could be removed from the cocktail without loss of protection. In contrast, Scott and Woodside (1976) showed that sodium glutamate was essential for the stability of freeze-dried herpes virus.",

The process is usually divided into three stages: prefreezing, sublimation drying under vacuum (primary drying), and desorption or secondary drying. Prefreezing can be accomplished in special freezers or in the freeze-dryer itself. A freeze-dryer has a vaccuum pump that removes air from a chamber that holds vials of the material to be freeze-dried. Water vapor generated through this process is condensed into a refrigerated trap and is not allowed to enter the vacuum pump. The rate of sublimation can be controlled by regulating the heat transfer to the frozen material. After final drying, inert gas is used to fill the vials and protect the freeze-dried material from the deleterious effects of oxygen. The freeze-drying cycle requires optimization for each virus.",

Also, they should be nonhygroscopic to avoid moisture contamination of the freeze-dried mate-rial. For vaccines, the stabilizers must also be nonimmunogenic and nonreactive in the vaccine recipient. One of the first stabilizers used for viral freeze-drying was 2.5% gum acacia to preserve the infectivity of vaccinia virus (Rivers and Ward, 1935) . Peptone and normal horse serum were also successfully used for freeze-drying of vaccinia virus (Collier, 1951; Sparkes and Fenje, 1972) .

Varicella-zoster virus was also freeze-dried successfully in this combination of stabilizers, but Grose (1981) found that he could eliminate glutamate and albumin from the mixture and still retain 100% recovery of this very labile virus.

Various viruses have been freeze-dried to approximately 1% moisture and shown to be stable over periods of time at 4~ but better long-term stability can be achieved by storage at -20~ STABILITY Assays for retained infectivity following freeze-drying are done on rehydrated vials of freeze-dried virus. A volume of sterile, distilled water is used to reconstitute the vial, with titration of the virus done immediately in the appropriate plaque or infectivity assay. The best control for baseline infectivity would be the virus harvest that was assayed prior to freezedrying. Often, frozen and thawed specimens are used for baseline titers. Freeze-dried viruses are normally stored at 4~ or -20~ Accelerated stability studies can be done to test thermostability for shorter periods at elevated temperatures. Often an ambient temperature of 25~ or temperatures of 35-37~ are used for accelerated studies.

The first viral vaccine to be freeze-dried was yellow fever vaccine (Penna, 1956) . Recent advances have resulted in more stable, freeze-dried yellow fever vaccines (Robin et al., 1971; Burfoot et al., 1977) . The WHO standard for stability of this vaccine is no more than one log10 loss of potency held at 37~ for 2 weeks. A recent collaborative study of yellow fever vaccines from 12 manufacturers demonstrated that 7 of 12 vaccines met this requirement. Similar WHO stability standards are in place for live, freeze-dried,measles vaccine. A method to freeze-dry and stabilize trivalent, live, attenuated, oral polio vaccine is being sought so that this vaccine can be delivered and used in developing countries without significant loss in potency. It has been proposed that thermoresistant mutants of polioviruses might serve as the prototype for the development of heat-stable vaccine strains (Kew, 1989) . Alternatively, organic compounds such as WIN 51711 and R 78206, which bind to polivirus VP1, have been found to increase the half-life of poliovirus antigen 50-to 250-fold at temperatures up to 48~ (Rombaut et al., 1991) . These drugs stabilize the conformation of the viral capsid and exhibit a potent antiviral effect that would not make them suitable as stabilizers for a live virus vaccine. In the future, similar compounds could be designed to stabilize but not inhibit the replication of live poliovirus strains. Other licensed, freeze-dried live-viral vaccines are those for mumps and rubella, whereas vaccines for varicella (chicken pox) and cytomegaloviruses are being developed that will require stabilization by freeze-drying. Table 3 lists licensed vaccines as well as those still being tested and the available published data on freeze-drying of these vaccines.",
