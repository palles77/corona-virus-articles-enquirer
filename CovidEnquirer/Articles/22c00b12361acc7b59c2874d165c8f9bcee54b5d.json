            "text": "The 7-year medical education program in Taiwan has been established since 1949. More than 60 years later, many medical professionals have observed and voiced its deficiencies following the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome. The deficiencies are three-fold: (1) specialties are excessively institutionalized, (2) students engage in passive learning and memorization, and (3) passing one written national examination serves as the means of granting permanent physician qualification. The situation has aroused concerns and discussions among medical professionals and educators for a new medical education program. Authorized by the Conference of Deans of Medical Schools in Taiwan, Prof. Chyi-Her Lin assembled a team for planning medical curricular reform. Subsequently, Prof. Shan-Chwen Chang organized a task force team which has been monitoring the new 6-year program since 2013. The aims of medical reform by Prof. Lin are (1) to eliminate the specialty training part, (2) to use innovative teaching methods to motivate students to learn proactively, and (3) to implement competency-based medical education. Now, the first class of physicians will enter the workplace in 2019, subject to various clinical challenges.",

It is aimed at cultivating professional physicians who are devoted to lifelong learning and self-improvement. According to criticism from the National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation in 1998, Taiwan's medical schools began to initiate curricular reform to improve several deficiencies in medical education [2] . During the transformation of Taiwan into a developed country, citizens began to question the high social status of physicians, and educational philosophic thoughts from the USA started to influence the traditional curriculum design. Considering contemporary societal needs, the medical education program should be transformed. This review presents an exploration of the roots underlying the medical educational reform over the past 30 years and the prospects of future physicians in Taiwan [3] .",

Moreover, the time-based educational approach adopted in the previous program has been restructured. Specifically, an outcome-based educational approach that is based on those of other countries transformed the old medical education program into a 6-year program and established criteria for qualified physician status according to the required professional abilities for health care [12] . Core competencies comprising various combinations of knowledge, skills, and attitudes are increasingly recognized and defined. Furthermore, the various clinical standards of physicians with different core competencies are combined to establish milestones for clinical physicians, the practice results of which are ultimately demonstrated in the clinical outcomes [13, 14] . Numerous countries have developed unique competency-based medical education (CBME) systems [15] . Canadian scholars recommended the implementation of a responsible and flexible learner-centered educational method instead of the time-based educational approach. They identified 10 common factors that can be categorized into four main themes as follows: Organizing framework, rationale, contrast with time, and implementation; and six subthemes: Outcomes and milestones defined, the curriculum of competencies, demonstrable abilities, assessment of competencies, learner center, and societal needs [13, 16] . Accordingly, in medical education, eliminating the discipline-centered teaching method might accelerate the diversified integration of courses oriented toward clinical practice and basic medicine. The essence of core-CBME should be thoroughly explored before the introduction of localized CBME in Taiwan [17] .",

This \"learning-by-doing\" in the workplace is consistent with Dewey's perspective [26] . The essential elements of Dewey's perspective include evoking students' intrinsic curiosity, which might subsequently be transformed into active motivation for learning continuously; cultivating problem-solving and task-achievement abilities by using project-based learning; and transforming classrooms into laboratories and encouraging students to engage in lifelong learning. The key factor still underlines clinical teachers' guidance throughout the learning process, the transformation of medical knowledge into practical skills, and management of clinical tasks, all of which closely match the concept of CBME and outcome-based education. The bottom-up reform of the medical education program and the top-down reform of the education program led by medical educators would complement each other only when teachers are given autonomy in teaching activity.",

Thus, the 6-year medical education program creates a complete learning environment using an innovative curriculum design that combines a formal curriculum, an informal curriculum, and a hidden curriculum (i.e., making it new). Several examples of curriculum design are presented as follows. In Chung Shan Medical University in Taiwan, a flipped teaching method is applied in the anesthesiology course; this enables students to learn at their own pace and thus improve their professional competencies and engage in self-directed learning by engaging in pre-class preparations and using the interactive online teaching platform Zuvio in the class [29] . Several institutions have also applied a hidden curriculum. For example, Tzu Chi University in Taiwan has implemented a silent mentor program aimed at cultivating the spirit of service in students [28] . National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan has implemented an on-doctoring program that emphasizes the cultivation of human-centered thinking and lifelong learning in students [30] . Furthermore, the Miharashi medical service team in Tzu Chi University has, since 2006, taught students about serving others by arranging visits to indigenous tribes [31] . Such visits enable students to perceive health needs from residents of remote areas in eastern Taiwan and consequently inspire students to respect life and engage in self-reflection. Harden proposed SPICE model to design curriculum during implement of educational reform strategies [32] . Educators thus use problem-based methods to evaluate a community's needs and provide learner-centered courses for creating a comprehensive and systematic learning environment. However, numerous teachers and parents have raised concerns about the practical processes of an informal curriculum and a hidden curriculum in Taiwan.",

Thus, several issues with the implementation of the teaching strategies in the new medical education program involve recruiting and retaining the right teachers and defining the required teaching abilities of clinical teachers in medical schools [23] . Harris advocated that medical teachers can refine themselves by not only advancing in the medical profession but also enhancing their teaching skills and general competencies in the contemporary medical system. These problems might also occur in the new education program. An example of such problems is as follows: Determining how existing clinical teachers under the old system can understand the basic competencies defined in the 6-year medical education and how they can adapt instruction methods to attain learners' competencies and allocate educational resource according to various teaching objectives effectively. A disruptive education environment might impose a burden on clinical physicians and result in patient dissatisfaction.",

Prof. Huang analyzed problems in the quota of full-time teachers in medical schools in Taiwan and suggested that the full potential of such teachers' passion and skills for teaching was not raised [5] . In addition, universities and schools face difficulties in supervising clinical teachers, and this leads to reduced teaching quality. A necessary reform depends upon bringing together around common goals all of the key players in the organization, regulation and conduct of medical education, taking an example as Emory School of Medicine in the US [35] . Regarding the recruitment of teachers in medical schools, we suggest the following changes: Stakeholders establishing recruitment standards that are based on teaching performance instead of research publications, which were emphasized in previous educational program; adoption of teaching experience and faculty's competencies as the basis for determining the number of courses the teacher should undertake; implementation of teacher evaluation to prevent senior faculty from passing on most of their courses to junior members in order to ease their own burden; supervisors inspecting in-service teachers' performance in lifelong learning and passion for teaching, moreover, developing innovative teaching activities; the educational institutes providing supplementary and enabling training courses for unqualified teachers to receive credit for faculty development and fulfil teaching obligation in medical education.",

Physicians' abilities are actually judged by patients in the clinical setting. When patients encounter novice graduates, who are considered to be adequately capable by medical schools, they cannot distinguish physicians from the new and the old program. Therefore, clinical personnel may shoulder any response and conflicts in the clinic during the transition of two educational programs. The burden imposed on physicians who also serve as clinical teachers is heavier than ever. To bridge the gap between the new and old medical education programs, clinical faculty must adhere to the essential goals of education, share clinical, and teaching responsibilities with each other. Proponents of education reform must remain committed to the principle of prioritizing the interests of patients, regardless of the corporatization of universities and the unspoken pressure from authority.",

Nevertheless, to fill the education gap in the era of the reform, the industry, government, and academia have devoted efforts to improve policies and modify the integrated courses of liberalism and basic clinical medicine. Various challenges are encountered in the clinical environment, which contains the most learning opportunities. We believe that the medical teams may be exhausted if students graduating from the new education program are designated as PGY before their confidence and professional capabilities in practicing clinical tasks independently are confirmed. In addition, concerns raised in the medical environment might restrict the professional development of medical students graduating from the new program. Finally, medical schools should focus on the systematic development of clinical teachers, provide lifelong training programs for teachers, emphasize the protection of patients' rights, and at the same time, the development of medical personnel's comprehensive profession in clinical environment continuously.",
