We used experimental human pneumococcal carriage to investigate whether upper respiratory tract viral infection predisposes individuals to carriage. A total of 101 healthy subjects were screened for respiratory virus before pneumococcal intranasal challenge. Virus was associated with increased odds of colonization (75% virus positive became colonized vs. 46% virus-negative subjects; P \u00bc 0.02). Nasal Factor H (FH) levels were increased in virus-positive subjects and were associated with increased colonization density. Using an in vitro epithelial model we explored the impact of increased mucosal FH in the context of coinfection. Epithelial inflammation and FH binding resulted in increased pneumococcal adherence to the epithelium. Binding was partially blocked by antibodies targeting the FH-binding protein Pneumococcal surface protein C (PspC). PspC epitope mapping revealed individuals lacked antibodies against the FH binding region. We propose that FH binding to PspC in vivo masks this binding site, enabling FH to facilitate pneumococcal/epithelial attachment during viral infection despite the presence of anti-PspC antibodies. We propose that a PspC-based vaccine lacking binding to FH could reduce pneumococcal colonization, and may have enhanced protection in those with underlying viral infection.",

[10] [11] [12] We used an experimental human pneumococcal carriage (EHPC) model 13 to investigate the relationship between asymptomatic URT viral infections and pneumococcal colonization in humans. Experimental carriage offers a unique opportunity to investigate mucosal responses 14, 15 in a setting where the onset and termination as well as density of pneumococcal carriage episodes are known. 16, 17 In this study, we hypothesized that subjects with an asymptomatic URT viral infection would be more susceptible to pneumococcal carriage acquisition and/or would have increased carriage density. We observed that virus was associated with a 2.8-fold increase in the odds of becoming colonized after experimental inoculation. We then investigated a possible mechanism by which virus could modulate mucosal defenses and increase colonization. We measured levels of several soluble innate factors at the nasal mucosa and observed that levels of human Factor H (FH) were increased in subjects coinfected with virus and pneumococcus.",

The first and initial contact of FH-coated pneumococci is mediated by glycosaminoglycans expressed on the surface of human cells, and the second step, pneumococcal uptake, is integrin mediated and depends on host signaling molecules such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. 23 In this study we found that a doubling in nasal FH levels was associated with a 9.3 times increase in the odds of carriage and a 4.26 times increase in the geometric mean of carriage density.",

Among virus-positive subjects, 75% became colonized as compared with 46% virus-negative subjects (P \u00bc 0.02, using Fisher's exact test). (b) Colonization density recovered from the nasopharynx was measured in nasal wash samples collected 2, 7, and 14 days following pneumococcal inoculation and is expressed as CFU ml \u00c0 1 recovered from nasal wash (NW) of virus-negative (no virus) and virus-positive (virus) groups. There was no difference in colonization density between viruspositive and virus-negative subjects. CFU, colony-forming unit; neg, negative; pos, positive. As virally infected individuals colonized with pneumococci had slightly high levels of FH, we investigated the relationship between FH and bacterial colonization density. We found that individuals with high mucosal FH levels had increased 6B colonization density (Figure 2e, P \u00bc 0.005).",

We used serum from 18 healthy adults challenged with pneumococcus to probe peptide arrays containing the entire sequence of PspC group 3 (PspC3, 491/00 strain). We observed that despite high levels of anti-PspC antibodies, only 1 out of the 29 samples had antibodies recognizing the binding sites for FH ( Figure 5 ) that supports the partial inhibition of FH binding to pneumococcus observed in vitro (Figure 4b) . Secretory IgA binding sites were recognized by all samples ( Figure 5 ). PspC-FH binding is specific to humans and does not occur in mice. 25, 26 We repeated the peptide arrays using sera from mice immunized with PspC3 to test the hypothesis that PspC would not be masked by binding of FH and therefore mice would produce antibodies against this region. We found that sera from immunized mice recognized the binding site for FH as well as all the other peptides already identified by human sera (Supplementary Figure S2) .

We observed that treatment of pneumococcus with nasal wash containing several innate factors, including FH, promoted increased epithelial attachment and internalization. This effect was more pronounced when bacteria were treated with purified human FH or the epithelium was inflamed.",

            "text": "We used a pneumococcal strain lacking expression of PspC (D39 DPspC) to show that PspC mediates the effect of FH on epithelial adherence. Although D39 expresses PspC3 and the 6B strain used for human inoculation expresses PspC9, there is 58% similarity in the N-terminal (first 110 amino acids) between the PspC amino acid sequence of both strains. With D39, increased adherence promoted by nasal wash was not caused by existing FH alone in these samples. We observed no difference in adherence when nasal wash samples depleted of IgG or IgA were used to treat D39 DPspC and therefore the PspC-secretory IgA interaction was not the main mechanism for this increased adherence either. There are several pneumococcal-specific host-pathogen interactions that could play a role in epithelial attachment. 30 The interaction between PspC and vitronectin has recently been highlighted as an important mechanism for pneumococcal adhesion. 31 We hypothesize that in the presence of anti-PspC IgG and low levels of FH, there is decreased pneumococcal adherence as anti-PspC antibodies block adherence mediated by other factors such as vitronectin (Figure 6 , middle). FH continues to facilitate low levels of adherence because human anti-PspC antibodies do not recognize the FH binding site. When FH levels are high, pneumococcal adherence increases because of more interactions between PspC and FH ( Figure 6 , right). Decreased adherence caused by the binding of anti-PspC antibodies to other factors such as vitronectin is masked by this increase in Pspc-FH binding and adherence.",

            "text": "As we observed that the PspC-FH interaction was associated with high rates and densities of carriage in humans coinfected with virus, we tested whether antibodies to the vaccine candidate PspC could block this interaction. PspC-based vaccines are protective against both invasive pulmonary disease and colonization in murine models of infection. 32, 33 We observed a partial blocking of FH binding to pneumococcus by flow cytometry analysis and epithelial adherence assay. Anti-PspC IgG purified from serum blocked bacterial attachment when low levels of FH were present in the assay. These results could be explained by the fact that healthy adults do not have antibodies specific to the PspC region that binds FH. By using sera from mice immunized with PspC in these assays, we found that human carriage induces anti-PspC antibodies to the same epitopes as the ones induced by parenteral immunization with purified protein in mice. Two major differences were that (i) mice did not have antibodies against the proline-rich region of PspC, although this was one of the most recognized regions by human antibodies and (ii) human antibodies did not recognize the binding site for FH on PspC whereas immunized mice did. Crossreactive antibodies against the proline-rich region of the PspA could explain the high levels of recognition of the PspC proline-rich region in humans. 34, 35 We have previously observed that colonization increased mucosal IgG antibodies to the N-terminal region of PspA but not PspC. 17 Most importantly, the fact that humans have an inefficient presentation of the PspC region that binds to FH strongly suggests that FH binding to pneumococcus during colonization covers this site of the PspC antigen.",

PspC-FH interaction allows pneumococci to protect themselves from the complement system 36 as well as facilitate pneumococcal adherence and uptake by human epithelial cells. 37 Increased adherence to lung epithelial cells was also reported when pneumococci were preincubated with FH 38 and could explain the associated high burden of pneumonia following influenza infections. 39 Polymorphisms in the FH gene have been associated with increased susceptibility to Staphylococcus aureus colonization in humans. 40 Binding to human FH has also been described as an important host-pathogen interaction for Neisseria meningitidis 41 and a FH binding protein is a component in the first licensed vaccine against N. meningitidis serogroup B. [42] [43] [44] Point mutations that eliminate FH binding have been shown to enhance protective antibody responses to vaccination using this meningococcal FH binding protein. 45 Our results support the use of PspC as a mucosal vaccine candidate and highlight that mutations in the FH binding site that allow antibody generation against this region should be considered for any vaccine based on PspC. Blocking PspC-FH interaction with specific PspC antibodies at the mucosa has the potential to reduce viral-associated pneumococcal colonization and burden of pneumonia associated with viral infections.

Bacterial suspensions were added to wells containing D562 cells (500 ml per well), plates were gently shaken, and 20 ml was obtained from each well for dilution and initial CFU quantification on blood agar plates (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK). The 24well plates were then incubated at 37 1C 5% CO 2 for 3 h. Wells were washed 5 times with PBS Ca 2 \u00fe Mg 2 \u00fe to remove unbound bacteria and cells were either lysed with 1% saponin for 10 min (for adherence) or treated with 100 mg ml \u00c0 1 of ampicillin in EMEM (1 ml per well) for 3 h at 37 1C 5% CO 2 before lysing (for internalization). Recovered bacteria were quantified by serial dilution on blood agar plates. Plates were incubated at 37 1C 5% CO 2 overnight and initial and recovered CFUs were counted. Averages of initial D39 CFU values were used to create a correction factor so that the recovered CFUs for both strains could be compared. All conditions were performed in duplicate and experiments were performed at least twice. For each experiment, the average recovered CFUs from the control condition (adherence of D39 untreated bacteria to noninflamed cells) was used to calculate fold change for all remaining conditions. Anti-PspC antibody epitope mapping. Overlapping peptide arrays containing 15-mer peptides with a frameshift of four residues corresponding to the amino acid sequence of PspC3 (GenBank accession no. EF424119) were synthesized in a slide support (CelluSpots, Intavis, Cologne, Germany). Peptide arrays were incubated individually with 29 sera samples collected from 18 subjects inoculated with pneumococcus or from mice immunized with 3 doses of 5 mg of PspC3 containing 50 mg of Alum as previously described. 49 Concentration of pneumococcal-specific antibodies was standardized so that each sample used for incubation contained 10 mg ml \u00c0 1 of PspC IgG. Detection was performed using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and anti-human IgG (Sigma-Aldrich). MTT 0.12M (Methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide), BCIP 0.16M (5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate), and MgCl2 1M in citrate-buffered saline pH 7.0 was used for development.",

Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to compare log-transformed FH levels and pneumococcal carriage density. Flow cytometry data were analyzed using Flow Jo v7.6.1 (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). To account for possible correlation among the repeated measurements in carriage status and density, GEE model was employed for the data analysis. For the GEE analysis of carriage presence (yes or no), binomial distribution and logit link function were used. For the GEE analysis of carriage density, log-transformed density was used as the dependent variable and normal distribution and identity link function were used. Three GEE models were estimated to assess the effects of FH levels and virus status on carriage status and density, separately and jointly. Model 1 has virus status (positive and negative) and day (days 2, 7, and 14) as predictors; model 2 has FH levels in log scale and day as predictors; model 3 has FH levels and virus status, day, and interaction between FH levels and virus as predictors.",
