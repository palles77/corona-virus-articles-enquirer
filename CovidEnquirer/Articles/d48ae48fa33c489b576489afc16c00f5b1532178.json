            "text": "Insensitivity and technical complexity have impeded the implementation of high-throughput nucleic acid sequencing in differential diagnosis of viral infections in clinical laboratories. Here, we describe the development of a virome capture sequencing platform for vertebrate viruses (VirCapSeq-VERT) that increases the sensitivity of sequence-based virus detection and characterization. The system uses~2 million probes that cover the genomes of members of the 207 viral taxa known to infect vertebrates, including humans. A biotinylated oligonucleotide library was synthesized on the NimbleGen cleavable array platform and used for solution-based capture of viral nucleic acids present in complex samples containing variable proportions of viral and host nucleic acids. The use of VirCapSeq-VERT resulted in a 100-to 10,000-fold increase in viral reads from blood and tissue homogenates compared to conventional Illumina sequencing using established virus enrichment procedures, including filtration, nuclease treatments, and RiboZero rRNA subtraction. VirCapSeq-VERT had a limit of detection comparable to that of agent-specific real-time PCR in serum, blood, and tissue extracts. Furthermore, the method identified novel viruses whose genomes were approximately 40% different from the known virus genomes used for designing the probe library. The VirCapSeq-VERT platform is ideally suited for analyses of virome composition and dynamics. IMPORTANCE VirCapSeq-VERT enables detection of viral sequences in complex sample backgrounds, including those found in clinical specimens, such as serum, blood, and tissue. The highly multiplexed nature of the system allows both the simultaneous identification and the comprehensive genetic characterization of all known vertebrate viruses, their genetic variants, and novel viruses. The operational simplicity and efficiency of the VirCapSeq-VERT platform may facilitate transition of high-throughput sequencing to clinical diagnostic as well as research applications.",

Nucleic acid (NA) extracts of human lung tissue or whole blood were spiked with various amounts of NAs representing large and small, positive-and negative-strand, segmented and nonsegmented, and DNA and RNA viruses (Table 1) . Spiked lung (pool 1) and blood (pool 2) NA preparations were divided and processed in parallel using a standard Illumina HTS protocol or the VirCapSeq-VERT system, whereby viral sequences are enriched by positive selection. Each of the preparations was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer, loading 2 lanes per pool. VirCapSeq-VERT resulted in a 100-to 1,000-fold increase in on-target (viral) reads and a reduction of host background reads from 99.7% to 68.2% in lung and from 99.4% to 38.5% in blood ( Fig. 2 ; also, see Table S4 in the supplemental material). The average coverage also increased dramatically, with nearly full-length sequences (\u03fe95%) being obtained for all viruses (Table 2 ). Figure 3 shows selected examples of To determine the threshold for detection of viral sequence, we used NA from lung tissue homogenate and EDTA-blood that contained different amounts of WNV and herpes simplex virus 1 (HHV-1) NA. Nearly complete genome recovery (\u03fe90%) was achieved for both viruses at input levels of 100 viral copies in 50 ng of blood NA or 1,000 viral copies in 100 ng lung NA (Fig. 4) . Extrapolated to clinical samples, these values correspond to a blood specimen containing approximately 1,200 copies/ml or a tissue specimen containing approximately 16,000 copies/mg, assuming 100% extraction yield (see Table S5 in the supplemental material). Even at the lowest level of virus input tested, 10 viral copies per 50 ng background NA, corresponding to approximately 100 copies/ml blood, VirCapSeq-VERT enabled recovery of 45 kb (29%) of HHV-1 and 0.75 kb (7%) of WNV genome sequence. We then tested human blood and serum samples (1 ml) spiked with live enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) virus stock. VirCapSeq-VERT enabled detection in both sample types at a concentration of 10 copies/ml (Fig. 5) , comparable to the sensitivity of real-time PCR (see Table S6 in the supplemental material).",

To further test the capacity of VirCapSeq-VERT to detect novel viral sequences, we used an extract of a liver homogenate from a deer mouse experimentally infected with the rodent hepacivirus isolate RHVpl-01. The complete genome sequence of this isolate has a \u03fd65% global nucleotide sequence identity with the sequences used to design the VirCapSeq-VERT probes. Nonetheless, VirCapSeq-VERT selectively enriched RHVpl-01 sequence in conserved regions encoding the helicase and polymerase genes, for which bioinformatics analysis showed the presence of probes with up to 90% nucleotide identity in the VirCapSeq-VERT probe pool. We conclude therefore, from rotavirus and hepacivirus experiments, that while not an ideal platform for viral discovery, VirCapSeq-VERT can detect novel viruses through hybridization to short conserved sequence motifs within larger genome fragments. Sample multiplexing. During the estimation of the limit of detection of VirCapSeq-VERT, we processed samples individually or together during hybridization capture. The results obtained with the samples processed individually were superior (see Table S5 in the supplemental material). This finding suggested that competition for probe populations may compromise application in diagnostic settings where patient samples may have widely divergent virus loads. We investigated the practical impact of this potential confounding factor in assays using 21 barcoded libraries representing samples containing seven different viruses at genome loads that varied from 10 2 to 10 8 . One set represented the seven different viruses each at a concentration of approximately 10 4 genome copies/library. To mimic competition anticipated in some clinical samples, the second set contained the same seven libraries at 10 4 copies, combined with an additional 14 libraries prepared with the seven viruses at 10 2 and at 10 5 to 10 8 copies. Virus detection was not impaired in multiplex assays even with samples that varied up to 10 4 in target concentration (Table 5) ; however, genome coverage was typically higher in 7-plex than in 21-plex assays.",

However, concerns regarding sensitivity, especially in high-host-background settings, cumbersome and timeconsuming sample processing, and cost pose hurdles that would need to be overcome in order to realize the potential of HTS. Unlike 16S rRNA of bacteria, viruses lack universally conserved markers and have plastic genomes that easily generate mutants, strains, and variants. Virus variants differing in sequence, even by a single point mutation, can vary in host range, transmissibility and pathogenicity (23, 24) . Accordingly, an ideal viral diagnostic platform should enable sensitive multiplexed detection of all vi-ruses and their variants. Nucleic acid capture with oligonucleotides has been used to enhance the efficiency of HTS for characterizing host (25, 26) or selected microbial (27, 28) targets at low scale. However, to our knowledge, VirCapSeq-VERT is the first example wherein a positive selection method for HTS has been employed for comprehensive, sensitive application in microbial diagnostics and whole virome analysis.",
