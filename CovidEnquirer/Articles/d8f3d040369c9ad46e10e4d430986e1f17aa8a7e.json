Possible antiviral mechanisms of macrophages are defined and referred to as intrinsic, i.e. the ability of macrophages to serve as a nonpermissive barrier between the virus and susceptible cells and extrinsic, i.e. the ability of macrophages to affect the virus or virus replication in surrounding cells. Most studies on the role of macrophages in natural resistance to virus infections have been performed in animal models. An interesting aspect of many viral infections in animals is the finding of a genetically determined variation in natural resistance. Because of the availability of numerous inbred and congenic strains most studies on genetically determined resistance have been performed in mice. The classical examples are resistance to flaviviruses and susceptibility to mouse hepatitis virus, both of which are inherited as dominant, monogenic traits. With these viruses macrophage intrinsic restriction of virus replication has been found to express at the cellular level the genetics of resistance/susceptibility seen in the intact animal. Other examples, where macrophages have been implicated in genetically determined resistance include herpes simplex virus and influenza virus.",

Macrophages are generally more restrictive for virus replication than most other cell types [4] . By infectious center assays it has been shown that even though the majority of macrophages may be infected (as detected by immunofluorescence), only a minor fraction of the cells release infectious virus.

[13] found that virus-restrictive adult mouse macrophages, in contrast to more permissive suckling mouse macrophages, produced interferon when infected with herpes simplex virus type 1. We have recently found that early interferon production by macrophages from mice resistant to herpes simplex virus type 2 is higher than interferon production by macrophages from susceptible mice and shows the same mode of inheritance as in vivo resistance and in vitro restriction of virus replication in macrophage cultures ( [14] and Mogensen, to be publ.). The non-permissiveness of human monocytes for herpes simplex virus type 1 replication at a high multiplicity of infection has also been linked to interferon production in the cultures [15] . With some other viruses interferon production by macrophages has not been found to reflect virus replication in the cells. Thus, Hanson et al. [16] found that mouse macrophages with genetically determined differential ability to replicate flaviviruses produced equal amounts of interferon in response to these viruses. However, in the flavivirus-macrophage system, restrictive macrophages from resistant animals were more sensitive to the protective action of interferon than were more permissive macrophages from susceptible mice. Such a differential sensitivity to interferon between permissive and non-permissive macrophages has also been described for myxoviruses [2] and mouse hepatitis virus type 3 [17] . In a recent study on macrophage intrinsic restriction of vesicular stomatitis virus and encephalomyocarditis virus it was suggested that low, undetectable levels of endogenous interferon are maintaining an antiviral state in macrophages, since anti-interferon treatment of normal mice before macrophage harvest rendered these cells permissive to a subsequent challenge with the viruses [18] . A similar observation has been made with myxoviruses [2] .",

Special interest has focused on the question of whether interferon production by macrophages or direct macrophage cytotoxicity towards infected cells are involved. In the herpes system, which has been studied in detail, these mechanisms do not seem to be important, and it has been suggested that the effect is related to cytostasis through disturbance of host cell macromolecular synthesis [19] . A similar conclusion was reached by Hayashi et al. [20] .

The fact that a given macrophage population may show a high activity in one and not the other character may indicate that this is not the case. For instance, resident macrophages are generally more intrinsically resistant to herpes simplex virus replication than thioglycollate-induced macrophages, whereas only the latter show high extrinsic restriction [5, 10] . Likewise, Stohlman et al. [24] were unable to correlate extrinsic and intrinsic macrophage an-tiviral activity toward mouse hepatitis virus. Preliminary information from the study of Wildy et al. [21] on the role of macrophage arginase in extrinsic restriction of viruses indicates that selfstarvation of arginine may not be the effector mechanism in intrinsic restriction. However, a recent study has shown that q~-interferon-activated macrophages express intrinsic restriction and that this is related to arginase production, since addition of increasing doses of arginine to the macrophage cultures abrogated the induced restriction [25] . Probably, the effector mechanisms in both systems, and thus their relationship, may depend on the particular virus-macrophage pair studied and on the experimental protocol used.",

Genetic analyses of several strains of mice have shown a complete agreement between mouse and macrophage susceptibility to the virus.

With both types of the virus, macrophages from resistant strains of mice exert higher intrinsic restriction of virus replication than macrophages from susceptible strains, a difference which is not seen in fibroblast cultures. In the case of herpes simplex virus type 2, macrophage restriction of virus replication correlated with resistance in the F~ generation. Furthermore, high and low restriction segregated close to a 1:1 ratio in macrophage cultures prepared from individual mice in the BC~ generation, indicating that a single gene is at work [32] . With the type 1 virus, Lopez and Dudas [10] were not able to relate the genetics of macrophage restriction of virus replication to resistance. Although Ft mice were found to be resistant to the infection, macrophages from these mice replicated the virus as well as did macrophages from the susceptible parent. One reason for the different results obtained with the two virus types might well be found in the experimental approaches used. The results with type 2 were obtained with normal peritoneal macrophages infected in vivo or the day after plating in culture, whereas the results with type 1 were derived from thioglycollate-induced or 4-day-cultured macrophages, which have lost much of the native restriction-capability against the virus.",

The nature of the effector cell(s) in the mouse has not been determined, but studies in humans have pointed to precursors of the monocyte-granulocyte series [33] . Genetically determined resistance to herpes simplex virus type 1 has also been related to very early interferon production, which is in part governed by an X-linked gene [34] . We have also shown that infection of resistant mice with high doses of herpes simplex virus type 2 elicits an early interferon response, which shows the same pattern of inheritance (X-linked, dominant) as macrophage-related resistance, suggesting an association between interferon induction and macrophage restriction [141. Since interferon is known to activate NK cells and macrophages, early interferon induction may well be a central feature in genetically determined resistance to herpes simplex virus. Whether the link turns out to be genetically determined interferon production by macrophages, or interferon-induced, genetically determined activation of monocytes/macrophages to virus restriction or non-specific cytotoxicity is not clear at the moment.",

In 1978 it was shown that peritoneal macrophages and Kuppfer cells from A2G and F1 mice, as opposed to macrophages from a number of susceptible mouse strains, resisted replication of influenza virus. Furthermore, resistance and susceptibility of individual mice and their macrophages consegregated in a ratio close to 1:1 in back-crosses between resistant F1 mice and susceptible mice, indicating that resistance in vivo and macrophage restriction of virus replication were related. However, in elegant studies with radiation chimeras it was later found that lethally irradiated Mx \u00f7 mice substituted with macrophage precursors from susceptible Mx-mice and vice versa expressed the resistance phenotype of the recipient, in spite of the fact that their macrophages expressed the phenotype of the donor. Thus, macrophage resistance and resistance of the intact animal did not seem to be causally related. Instead, evidence has been presented that the Mx gene influences the sensitivity of individual cells, including macrophages but also parenchymal cells, to an influenza virus-specific antiviral action of interferon.",
