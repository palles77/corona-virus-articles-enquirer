The APL 9 increases MHC/peptide (pMHC) complex stability, rigidifies the peptide and facilitates T cell 10 receptor (TCR) recognition through reduced entropy costs. Structural analyses of pMHC 11 complexes before and after TCR binding, combined with biophysical analyses, revealed that 12 although the TCR binds similarly to all complexes, the p3P modification alters the conformations 13 of a very limited amount of specific MHC and peptide residues, facilitating efficient TCR 14 recognition. This approach can be easily introduced in peptides restricted to other MHC alleles, 15 and can be combined with currently available and future vaccination protocols in order to prevent 16 viral immune escape.

We 24 believe that this approach can be implemented to currently available or novel vaccination 25 approaches to efficiently restore T cell recognition of virus escape variants to control disease 26 progression. pMHC stability and immunogenicity has been to optimize interactions between peptide anchor 62 residues and MHC binding pockets [17] [18] [19] . However, escape variants that target TCR recognition 63 often exhibit optimal MHC anchor residues, reducing possibilities for such modifications. 64 .

Next, P14 TCR down-regulation was assessed upon exposure to gp33, V3P, Y4F or PF-loaded H-120 2D b+ RMA cells (Fig. 1C) . While H-2D b /gp33 induced significant TCR down-regulation, none 121 was detected with Y4F, even at high peptide concentrations. Exposure of P14 T cells to V3P 122 equaled or increased TCR internalization compared to gp33. Importantly, exposure to PF 123 significantly increased P14 TCR down-regulation compared to Y4F (Fig. 1C) . The crystal 124 structures of H-2D b /V3P and H-2D b /PF were determined to 2.5 and 2.6 \u00c5 resolution, respectively 125 .

The backbone of the p3P-APL corresponds exactly to the wild-type 129 peptides, indicating strict molecular mimicry (Fig. 1D) The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

This is well in line with previous studies in which the Y4F-specific T cell 174 clone YF.F3 killed efficiently targets presenting gp33 but did not produce IFNg [32] . Similar 175 results were obtained using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)-derived T cells (Fig. S4 ). In conclusion, The p3P modification facilitates TCR recognition 209 The three ternary TCR/MHC/peptide structures were compared with each corresponding TCR-210 unbound pMHC (Fig. 4, Fig. S8 ). The side chain of p4Y, essential for recognition by P14 [4, 33, 211 34], rotates down following P14 binding to both H-2D b /gp33 and H-2D b /V3P (Fig. 4A-B) . A 212 similar rotation was also observed for residue p4F in H-2D b /PF upon binding to P14 (Fig. 4C) . 213 The side chain of p6F in gp33 is also affected upon binding to P14 (Fig. 4A) . Interestingly, the 214 p3P modification resulted in a similar conformation for p6F in both H-2D b /V3P and H-2D b /PF 215 prior to binding to P14 ( Fig. 1D and Fig. 4) . Furthermore, the side chain of residue p1K in H-216 2D b /gp33 also moves towards the N-terminal of the peptide binding cleft following P14 binding 217 (Fig. 4A) , taking an identical conformation as in both p3P-substituted peptides (Fig. 4D) .

In contrast to gp33, the p2-p4 section is more constrained in both V3P and PF, 223 following TCR binding (Fig. 4B, 4C ). However, it should be noted that the final conformations of 224 all three peptides in the ternary complexes is nearly identical (Fig. 4D ). In conclusion, residues 1 225 and 6 in p3P-APLs take the same conformations prior to TCR binding as found in the ternary 226 complexes, potentially enabling a more favorable surface for P14 TCR binding. Furthermore, p1K in gp33 also takes a different conformation upon binding to P14, bending 239 backwards towards the H-2D b residues R62 and E163, which conformations are affected (Fig. 4A , 240 5A). Here again, the side chain of p1K takes exactly this conformation in both V3P and PF already 241 before TCR binding (Fig. 4, 5) . Altogether, p1K, P6F and heavy chain residues R62, H155 and 242 E163 have already adopted in the unbound V3P and PF complexes similar conformations to those 243 observed in all three ternary structures (Fig. 4, 5) . Thus, the p3P substitution potentially facilitates 244 TCR recognition by positioning specific key peptide and MHC residues prior to the formation of 245 .

This is well in line with our SPR and ITC results, which indicate that the 246 energy required for P14 recognition of V3P is reduced compared to gp33 (Table 1, Fig. S1 ). The results presented within this study indicate in our opinion that i) docking of P14 to p3P-331 modified peptides is facilitated since the conformations of key residues in both peptide and heavy 332 chain are already optimal prior to TCR binding (ready-to-go conformation); ii) consequently, the 333 energetic costs for TCR recognition should be reduced since there is no need for any major 334 movement in the rigidified epitope besides the conformational change for residue p4Y.

            "text": "used to enhance both pMHC stability and T cell avidity towards the mouse hepatitis 253 virus-specific subdominant S598 determinant [22, 36]. Most, if not all studies performed in other 254 laboratories have focused their efforts on introducing peptide mutations that would significantly 255 increase the stability of pMHCs with as little alteration as possible of peptide conformation. Here, 256 instead of mutating a key anchor position, we targeted interactions between peptide position 3 and 257 the MHC residue Y159, conserved among most known mouse and human alleles. Indeed, besides 258 H-2D b , we have previously demonstrated that the p3P modification enhances significantly the 259 stability of H-2K b in complex with different TAAs [23]. Thus, the p3P modification could 260 potentially enhance stabilization of other MHC-I alleles that comprise the heavy chain residue 261 Y159, leading to enhanced TCR recognition. 262 263 Here, we addressed if we could increase CD8 + T cell avidity and restore recognition of the viral 264 escape variant Y4F that binds to H-2D b with the same high affinity as gp33 [37]. The TCR P14 is 265 specific for H-2D b /gp33 and it has been previously demonstrated that P14 recognition is abolished 266 by the Y4F mutation [2, 3]. Comparison of the crystal structures of H-2D b /gp33 and H-2D b /Y4F 267 demonstrated that the only structural difference between these two pMHCs was the removal of the 268 hydroxyl tip from the peptide residue p4 [2]. We demonstrate that the p3P modification in PF 269 overcomes the restrictions imposed by the Y4F mutation, reestablishing P14 recognition of this 270 structural mimic of Y4F. Furthermore, we show that it is fully possible to restore endogenous 271 CD8 + T cell recognition of Y4F following vaccination with PF. Possibly, the higher avidity of 272 subsets of the endogenous T cell population for H-2D b /PF pushes them over a certain threshold significant secretion of cytokines, although these endogenous CD8 + T cells recognized 277 both PF and gp33-loaded MHC tetramers. Martin et al have previously provided evidence for 278 selective activation of different effector functions in CD8 + T cells by APLs. More specifically, the 279 results of their study show that the H-2Db/Y4F-specific T cell clone YF.F3 killed efficiently 280 targets presenting gp33 but did not produce high amounts IFNg against gp33 [32]. This is well in 281 line with the results presented in this study. Altogether, this suggests to us that vaccination with a 282 cocktail of epitopes could provide wider protection against both immunodominant and does it possibly work at the molecular level? The rigidification of p3P-modified peptides 286 could enhance TCR recognition by decreasing entropic costs. Indeed, we have previously 287 demonstrated in TAA models that peptide rigidification enhanced considerably TCR recognition 288 [26, 27]. Overall the effects of proline replacement on protein stability and function are well 289 established for a large ensemble of proteins [38], revealing that protein-protein interactions often 290 occur through regions enriched with proline residues [39]. Proline substitutions increase overall 291 protein stability as well as the stability of specific protein regions [40]. Indeed, proline replacement 292 of specific residues in TCR CDR loops can increase significantly recognition of antigens [41]. The 293 importance of the interaction of peptide residue p3P with residue Y159, conserved amongst most 294 known MHC-I alleles, has been previously described [27], revealing that p3P reduces significantly 295 the flexibility of the pMHC complex, thus decreasing unfavorable entropic change upon complex 296 formation. Such reduced entropic penalties for TCR recognition following p3P mutation structure and molecular dynamic studies [42]. A peptide that must move to optimize the 301 interactions with the bound TCR will increase the entropic cost for binding, resulting in slower 302 binding, lower affinity and less efficient recognition [43]. Consequently, although many TCRs 303 bind with unfavorable entropy changes [37, 44], reduction of conformational heterogeneity 304 coupled with rigidification of the peptides may lead to enhanced T cell recognition. In this study, 305 the p3P mutation reduces motion and therefore enhances T cell recognition by increasing T cell 306 association rate and decreasing entropic costs for binding. 307 308 Although X-ray structural studies of proteins provide accurate snapshots of protein complexes, 309 crystal structures provide relatively little information about the dynamic bases underlying protein-310 protein interactions. The dynamic motions of both pMHC and TCR impact on recognition by T 311 cells, clearly influencing function and recognition [42]. Here, we compared the crystal structures 312 of each studied pMHC complex before and after P14 TCR binding (besides the P14/H-2D b /Y4F 313 complex that could not be obtained since P14 does not bind to this pMHC). Peptides tune the 314 motions of MHC heavy chains and reduced motions may lead to enhanced recognition. Besides 315 the peptide rigidification imposed by the p3P modification, comparison of a structural snapshot 316for each ternary structure with each TCR-unbound pMHC variant indicated an additional structural 317 reason for the increased TCR recognition of p3P-modified epitopes. In all cases, conformational 318 differences were observed in peptide residues p1K and p6F in PF and V3P, compared to Y4F and 319 gp33, before TCR binding. In all p3P cases, the side chains of peptide residues p1K and p6F took 320 the same conformation, as observed in the ternary structures, prior to TCR binding. In line the conformation of the MHC \"TCR footprint\" heavy chain residues R62, H155 and 325 E163[46,47] was also affected following p3P substitution, possibly due to the movements of p1K 326 and p6F. Altogether, prior to TCR landing, the p3P modification alters the conformation of 327 residues both in the peptide and the MHC heavy chain similar to conformations taken upon binding328    to the TCR, thus predisposing the pMHC for facilitated TCR recognition.329 330",

Therefore, the design of a novel generation of APLs that could promote67 such responses would represent a crucial step towards the development of efficient anti-viral T-We have previously demonstrated that the immunogenicity of the cancer-associated H-2D b -71 restricted antigen gp10025-33 [23] or the T cell epitope associated with impaired peptide processing 72 (TEIPP) neo-epitope Thr4 [24-26] was dramatically improved following substitution of peptide 73 position 3 to a proline (p3P). Comparative structural analyses revealed that the conformation of 74 the APLs was similar to wild-type epitopes, and that the stabilizing effect of p3P is accounted for 75 by van der Waals and CH-\u03c0 interactions with the H-2D b residue Y159, conserved among most 76 known mouse and human MHC-I alleles, resulting in rigidification of the pMHC complex [27]. Importantly, vaccination with p3P-modified APLs elicited high frequencies of CTLs from the 78 endogenous repertoire that efficiently targeted H-2D b /gp10025-33 and H-2D b /Trh4 complexes on In the present study, we addressed if we could restore endogenous T cell recognition of a naturally 82 occurring viral escape variant following vaccination with a p3P-modified APL. It is well established 83 that infection of C57/Bl6 mice with LCMV induces robust CTL responses towards the 84 immunodominant H-2D b -restricted epitope gp33 (KAVYNFATM) [28]. Upon CTL pressure, a 85 limited number of mutations in gp33 emerge, with consistent patterns, allowing for viral CD8 + T-86 cell escape [2, 4, 29, 30]. The main naturally occurring mutation that allows LCMV to efficiently escape immune recognition, is the Y4F substitution (KAVFNFATM) which abrogates endogenous CD8 + T cell recognition as well as recognition by the H-2D b /gp33-specific TCR P14. Here, we 89 demonstrate that peptide vaccination with PF (KAPFNFATM) restores P14 recognition of Y4F in 90 LCMV-infected mice. Furthermore, vaccination with influenza constructs that encode for PF 91 provokes significant endogenous CD8 + T cell cross-recognition of Y4F. Comparison of crystal 92 structures of an ensemble of pMHC complexes before and after binding to the TCR P14 revealed that 93 i) P14 binds nearly identically to all complexes, ii) the conformations of peptide residues p1K and 94 p6F as well as H-2D b residues R62, E163 and H155 are affected by the p3P modification, 95 predisposing pMHC complexes for enhanced TCR recognition. The p3P modification also decreases 96 the entropic penalty for TCR recognition. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the possibility to 97 vaccinate with modified peptides and/or proteins for enhanced T cell recognition, and may form an 98 alternative basis for novel strategies to target viral escape mutants.",

Comparison of H-2D b /gp33 before (in green) and after P14 binding (in white) reveals that the 782 conformation of a very limited amount of pMHC residues is affected (shown as sticks).
