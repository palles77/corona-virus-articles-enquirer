            "text": "Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) non-structural protein 5B (NS5B) encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), a key enzyme which initiates RNA replication by a de novo mechanism without a primer and is a potential target for anti-virus therapy. We expressed the NS5B protein in Escherichia coli. The rGTP can stimulate de novo initiation of RNA synthesis and mutation of the GDD motif to Gly-Asp-Asp (GAA) abolishes the RNA synthesis. To better understand the mechanism of viral RNA synthesis in CSFV, a three-dimensional model was built by homology modeling based on the alignment with several virus RdRps. The model contains 605 residues folded in the characteristic fingers, palm and thumb domains. The fingers domain contains an N-terminal region that plays an important role in conformational change. We propose that the experimentally observed promotion of polymerase efficiency by rGTP is probably due to the conformational changes of the polymerase caused by binding the rGTP. Mutation of the GDD to GAA interferes with the interaction between the residues at the polymerase active site and metal ions, and thus renders the polymerase inactive.",

            "text": "Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is highly contagious and often causes a fatal disease (classical swine fever (CSF)), previously referred to as hog cholera, in susceptible pigs of all ages. The epidemic of CSF always leads to devastating financial losses, especially in a high pig density area, so it is classified as an Office International des Epizooties (OIE) List A disease. European Union (EU) pursues a straightforward, non-vaccination policy via stamping out suspected and infected herds since there is no efficient anti-CSFV vaccines (de Smit et al., 2001) . However, this policy is disputed because in 1997 in the Netherlands outbreaks of CSF brought total financial consequences of US$ 2.3 billion for combat-ing the major CSF epizootic (Meuwissen et al., 1999) . In the future, controlling CSF outbreaks might be based on therapy. At the same time, CSFV shows greater similarity in genome structure and RNA synthesis strategy to hepaciviruses than to flaviviruses (Lindenbach and Rice, 2001) . Because hepaciviruses are difficult to grow in cell culture, CSFV, a normative representative in pestiviruses, has been used as a model system for studying hepaciviruses. So there is an urgent need to develop infection mechanism and antiviral research about CSFV.",

            "text": "CSFV belongs to the genus pestivirus of the family Flaviviridae (van Regenmortel et al., 2000) . Like other members of the family, including the genus flavivirus and the genus hepacivirus, pestiviruses are small enveloped viruses containing a positive single-strand RNA genome. The CSFV genome of about 12.5 kbp contains a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding for a polyprotein of approximately 4000 amino acids and initiating at an internal ribosome 0168-1702/$ -see front matter \u00a9 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. doi:10. 1016/j.virusres.2005.03 .003 entry site (IRES). The polyprotein is processed into a total of 12 viral structural and non-structural proteins. The gene product order along the ORF is NH2-N pro -C-E rns -E1-E2-p7-NS2-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NSA-NS5B-COOH (Rice, 1996) . The 5 -UTR contains the IRES for capindependent translation of the viral polyprotein (Rijnbrand et al., 1997; Fletcher and Jackson, 2002) , the 3 -UTR may contain replication signals involved in minus-strand RNA synthesis (Yu et al., 1999) . Non-structural proteins are speculated to be components in the viral replication cycle. Replication of CSFV genome proceeds in two steps: synthesis of complementary minus-strand RNA using the genome as template and the subsequent synthesis of genomic RNA using this minus-strand RNA template. The key enzyme involved in both of these steps is a virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). This viral protein (non-structural protein 5B (NS5B)), which is located at the extreme C-terminus of the polyprotein, contains motifs shared by RdRps, such as the Gly-Asp-Asp (GAA) motif, which is highly conserved among RdRps (Koonin, 1991) and has been demonstrated to possess RdRp activity. CSFV RdRp is able to initiate replication de novo without the requirement for protein or nucleic acid primers (Kao and Sun, 1996; Kao et al., 1999 Kao et al., , 2001 .",

The fusion protein was demonstrated to have the ability to initiate de novo either plus-or minus-strand viral RNA synthesis in a primerindependent manner and to specifically interact with viral RNA templates. In order to understand the structural basis of RdRp enzymatic activity and potential drug susceptibility, we also compared the sequence of CSFV polymerase with those of HIV-1, reovirus, calicivirus, poliovirus, 6 and HCV polymerases, situated in the conserved sequence motifs that are shared among RdRps. In respect that CSFV shows great similarity in genome structure and RNA synthesis strategy to hepaciviruses and there are prolific structural and biochemical data on HCV polymerase, we built a three-dimensional model of the catalytic domain of CSFV RNA polymerase based on the conserved motifs in RdRps and HCV polymerase crystal structures. The validity of the model developed in the present study is supported by its ability to explain some of the key biochemical data. Analyzing conformational changes of the model and roles of the specific residues in the polymerization mechanism, we addressed some results which are likely to provide guidance in the design of future biochemical experiments and aid the development of anti-CSFV agents.",

The sequence of CSFV RdRp (718 amino acid residues; strain shimen; NCBI Accession No. AF157635) was aligned with that of representatives of the other three groups of Flavivirdae, and of five viral RdRps whose crystal structures are known. All sequences were aligned by seven alignment programs. These programs are: ClustalW (Francois et al., 1998) , SIM4 (Huang and Miller, 1991) , SAM-T02 (Kevin et al., 1998) and 3D-PSSM (Lawrence et al., 2000) , CD-search (Aron et al., 2002) , Superfamily (Gough et al., 2001; Julian and Cyus, 2002) and Block-Maker (Henikoff et al., 1995) . All methods were used with the default parameters provided by the authors. Then, the pairwise alignments between the target and template sequences were extracted, leading to different pairwise alignments between the target and the template. (b) Database building. Each position of the alignments was stored in a database, all the redundant results, i.e., the same amino acid placed at the same position by different programs, being scored in a frequency table. (c) Screening. Extracting the consensus between different methods may increase the overall confidence of the predictions tremendously. The position with the highest score was taken as the first anchor point to build the final target-template alignment. Incompatible results, aligning regions located up-and down-stream anchor points, were removed from the database. The process was pursued, new anchor positions being determined, and incompatible regions being eliminated, until all results were selected or removed. (d) The final target-template alignment anchor points were thus composed by the most frequent aligned positions, under the condition of compatibility. These structurally conserved regions (SCRs) will match residues of template according to the polymerases structure motifs. In less conserved regions or regions containing insertions or deletions, we adjusted the alignment of the predicted secondary structure of CSFV RdRp with the secondary structures of other viral RdRps and the properties of amino acids (hydrophobic or hydrophilic character).",

The best loop was selected using a scoring scheme, which accounts for force field energy, steric hindrance and favorable interactions like hydrogen bond formation. If no suitable loop can be identified, the flanking residues were included to the rebuilt fragment to allow for more flexibility. In cases where constraint space programming (CSP) does not give a satisfying solution and for loops above 10 residues, the Accelrys/MSI loop database was used to change or improve the improperly created regions in the CSFV RdRp model. The reconstruction of the model side chains was based on the weighted positions of corresponding residues in the template structures. Starting with conserved residues, the model side chains were built by iso-sterically replacing template structure side chains. Possible side chain conformations were selected from a backbone dependent rotamer library, which has been constructed carefully taking into account the quality of the source structures. A scoring function assessing favorable interactions (hydrogen bonds and disulfide bridges) and unfavorably close contacts was applied to select the most likely conformation. A short (200 steps) minimization procedure was performed in GROMOS 96 (Gunsteren et al., 1995) to remove undesirable interactions that had been generated by the modeling process. Validation of the structures was done by using the PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) , WHAT-CHECK (Vriend, 1990) , VERIFY-3D (Eisenberg et al., 1997) and ANOLEA (Francisco and Ernest, 1998) programs.

It con- The CSFV NS5B sequence has been truncated in the N-terminus and C-terminus. The HCV sequence has been truncated in the C-terminus. These sequences were aligned as described in Section 2. Asterisks below alignment indicate identical residues and dots indicate similar residues.

The fingers domain of CSFV RdRp can be divided into a palm-proximal region that is an \u2423-helix-rich subdomain called \u2423 fingers, and a distal region that is a \u2424-strandrich subdomain, which we have named the \"fingertips\" or \u2424 fingers. The fingertips subdomain is composed of seven \u2424strands and three \u2423-helices. Two loops, His96-Gly147 ( 1) and Asn264-Pro284 ( 2), extend from the fingertips to reach the thumb domain from the back. The end of the longer loop, 1, is helix B, which is locked into a hollow at the top corner of the fingers domain. A shorter \u2423-helix (helix A) at the top of the longer loop pack against the thumb domain, fitting in a groove among parallel \u2423-helix Q, S and U, thus closing the gap between the two domains (Fig. 6A) . The shorter loop, 2, wraps upward the 1 and occupies the region in space as a \u2424 hairpin motif. At the bottom of the loop 2, there is a hole embraced by residues from this \u2424 hairpin which are known to play a role in contacting the incoming nucleosidetriphosphate and the template. In reverse transcriptase, loop 1 is missing, but the loop corresponding to 2 occupies the same region in space, even though it is shorter (Huang et al., 1998) . These two loops 1 and 2 could act like flexible coils that adapt to the breathing motion of the polymerase during the catalytic cycle. The fingertips surface facing the hole is an electrostatically positive belt created by a line of conserved basic residues (Arg149, Lys263, Lys266, Lys282, Lys283 and Arg285) extending from the outside to the inside of the protein. The \u2423 fingers subdomain is located at the gate of the hole. Cooperating with helices A and B, helices C-E overhang the palm domain, and create a concave wall. This concave wall is electrostatically positive as a result of a line of basic residues (Arg214, Arg218, Lys219, Arg227, Lys228, Lys307 and Lys347) (Fig. 8) . The \u2423-helices that extend into the palm domain are very similar in all of the viral poly-merase families that were analyzed in HCV and poliovirus, while they are very different in composition than those of HIV RT (Hansen et al., 1997; Jacobo-Molina et al., 1993) . The unique architecture of the fingers of RdRps may determine their preference for RNA templates (discussed below).",

It consists of a three-stranded antiparallel \u2424-sheet (\u24249, \u242411 and \u242412), a small helix K following \u24249, three supporting \u2423-helices (\u2423N, \u2423O and \u2423P) and a \u2424-strand (\u242413) following the helix P, with an additional \u2423J helix at the thumb interface (Fig. 6A) . The antiparallel \u2424-sheet existing in all RdRps is the catalytic core of the palm domain. The \u2423O (residues 430-431), which also exists in calicivirus and 6 RdRp besides HCV and poliovirus, supports the precede \u2423helix (\u2423N). However, in caliciviral RdRp, the helix inserts the first-strand of the \u2424-sheet, and in 6 RdRp two helices follow the \u2423-helix, one supports it as the other precedes the first \u2424-strand and inserts the \u2424-sheet. In addition, 6 RdRp has a tighter palm structure with six \u2423-helices and four \u2424-strands trussing up the catalytic \u2424 sheet, whereas CSFV polymerase has four \u2423-helices and one \u2424-strand, calicivirus polymerase has four \u2423-helices and two \u2424-strands, HCV and poliovirus polymerases have three \u2423-helices and one \u2424-strand enlace the \u2424 sheet (Fig. 6C) . At the interface with the thumb domain, a long loop followed by the pair of \u2424-strands (\u242414 and \u242415) belonging to the thumb domain completes the palm domain. This pair of \u2424-strands region is similar in all RdRps and in HIV-1 RT. The palm domain, the catalytic domain of RdRp, contains the four-amino acid sequence motifs found in all classes of polymerases, named A-D, plus a fifth motif, E (Fig. 6) . The A-D motifs are highly conversed in RdRp, and motif A and C are also found in the DNA polymerase (DeLarue et al., 1990; Ito and Braithwaite, 1991) , whereas Kao, 1998) . Motifs A-E correspond to residues 338-357, 400-427, 439-456, 466-483 and 489-507 in CSFV RdRp, respectively. Motif A contains two aspartate residues (Asp345 and Asp350). Asp345 is responsible for binding the catalytic metal ions; Asp350 is primary substrate discriminator for rNTP over dNTP. The Asp345 near the end of the \u2424-strand is completely conserved in all classes of polymerases, while site 350 is almost always an aspartate in RdRps and a tyrosine or phenylalanine in RTs instead (DeLarue et al., 1990) . Interestingly, the position oppositely located at 342 in CSFV NS5B is almost never a positively charged residue in the alignments of RdRps (O'Reilly and Kao, 1998) . Motif C contains the highly conserved GDD motif that coordinates the catalytic metal ions. This structure is very similar in all classes of polymerases and positions the two aspartates (Asp448 and Asp449) close to the conserved aspartate of motif A. In motif E, the hydrophobic residues are important for the interactions with the palm core structure and account for the conservation of several hydrophobic residues in motifs A, C and D of RNAdependent polymerases (Hansen et al., 1997; Jacobo-Molina et al., 1993) .",

            "text": "The thumb domain of CSFV RdRp is composed of seven \u2423-helices (labeled Q to W) and four \u2424-strands (labeled 14-17) at the most C-terminal position. It contains a motif I (511-526) consisting of an \u2423-helix and a \u2424-strand. Arg517 is strictly conserved residue in the motif, and is essential for rGTP binding which can raise the enzymatic efficiency. The corresponding thumb region in HCV is mainly \u2423-helical, containing eight \u2423-helices and four \u2424-strands (Fig. 6D) . The more \u2423-helix (residues 460-466) in HCV RdRp is located between \u242416 and \u2423T, while in CSFV RdRp a long loop (residues 585-598) replaces it. Although the difference exists, the structure of thumb domain is not affected because three \u2423-helices (\u2423Q, \u2423S and \u2423U), which are comparatively conserved in RdRps, form the core of the thumb in CSFV RdRp. This domain reveals a striking difference to that of the thumb domain of calicivirus, poliovirus and 6 polymerases, which only contain the core of the domain, thus have a smaller structure (Fig. 6D) . In calicivirus, the thumb domain (residues 418-501) comprises four \u2423-helices and two long loops. The first loop links together the first and second \u2423helices and the second loop links together the third and fourth \u2423-helices (Ng et al., 2002) . The long loop (residues 428-446) connecting the first and second helix is folded away from the template cleft and packs against the N-terminal of the fingers domain. In contrast, the corresponding parts of CSFV (residues 529-540) and 6 polymerases (residues 526-547) are long loops rich in positively charged residues near the gate of the template tunnel, while in HCV (residues 401-407) and poliovirus (residues 405-409) the parallel structures are shorter turns. Moreover, CSFV RdRp, similar to HCV RdRp, has a long \u2424-hairpin (\u242416-17) connecting the third and fourth helices (\u2423S and \u2423T) and occluding the active site cleft. This hairpin acts as a discriminator for distinguishing the singlestranded RNA templates from double-stranded RNA (Hong et al., 2001) . Without the \u2424-hairpin structure, calicivirus, poliovirus and 6 enzymes are consistent with the ability of these enzymes to utilize double-stranded RNA as templates (L\u00f3pez V\u00e1zquez et al., 2001; Butcher et al., 2001) . Another function of this domain is to form a hydrophobic binding pocket near the domain core (\u2423Q, \u2423S and \u2423U) with the help of the palm domain and two long loops of the fingers domain. The rNTPs are bound in a wedge-like fashion to the hydrophobic binding pocket.",

Now no alignment method can be qualified as the absolute most reliable one. Every alignment method seeks a balance between sensitivity and selectivity. Extracting the consensus between different methods may increase the overall confidence of the predictions tremendously (Briffeuil et al., 1998; Julie et al., 1999) . So, in our subsequent alignment, alignments are obtained by combining, weighting and screening the results of seven multiple alignment programs which include all aspects described upper. These methods include: ClustalW is a progressive global alignment method; SIM4 is based on rigorous dynamic programming method; PSI-BLAST is an iterative search tool (Stephen et al., 1997) ; 3D-PSSM, CD-search, Superfamily, Block-Maker are based on locally conserved patterns (PSSM/profile or block); SAM-T02 is a HMM tool and Block-Maker consists of Gibbs sampler. At last, crucial for the sequence alignments were the prediction of the secondary structure of CSFV RdRp and the appropriate alignment of the predicted secondary elements of CSFV RdRp with the secondary structures of PV, HCV, RHDV, RV and 6 RdRps.",

The method uses amino acid interactions, and it is very accurate during the initial stages of the model building process. A complementary method able to improve the quality of the models produced by VERIFY-3D is ANOLEA (Melo and Feytmans, 1998) .

The experimental results reported above show that rGTP resulted in higher activities of CSFV RdRp when the minus-strand or plus-strand RNA template was used. To explain these results, we made the superposition of the HCV NS5B/rGTP complex onto the model of CSFV RNA polymerase. There is an rGTP binding site at the back of the thumb domain as HCV. The active surface of rGTP is about 31\u00c5 from the catalytic part which is on the bottom of the template-binding groove. Residues, which are located at the loop 1 of fingers, the helices U, V and the loop between them in the thumb domain, contact the nucleotide (Fig. 7A) . They are Arg127, Ser618, Gly621, Ala622, Trp623, Thr624 and Thr627. The side chain of Arg127 lying on the loop following the \u2423A, makes hydrogen bonds to the 2 -OH and oxygen of the ribose and \u2423-phosphate of the rGTP (Fig. 7B) . The aromatic side chain of Trp623 on the loop between the \u2423U and \u2423V makes another hydrogen bond to the N2 of the guanine, which is roughly perpendicular to the plane of Trp623 side chain. Thr624 and Thr627 provide a hydrophobic platform for orientating the guanine base. Near the ribose of the rGTP, Ser618 creating a coping cooperates with Gly621 and Ala622 in building a wall, with which Arg127 and Trp623 constitute a pocket for rGTP. In addition, the hydrogen bonds between the loop 1 and the \u2423 helices made by five amino acids, three from the thumb domain (Ser618 Val619, and Leu620) and two from the fingertips (Cys126 and His130) gives rise to a network of interactions involving fingers, thumb and rGTP. In HCV, Arg32 seems to be an important specificity determinant (Bressanelli et al., 2002) . Its bidentate hydrogen bonds to the ribose and the guanine can only exist with rGTP, since the orientation of the base is defined by its interactions with the two proline rings (P495 and P496) and Val499. In contrast, Arg127 of CSFV RdRp distinguishes rGTP from dGTP, and Trp623 plays the same part in defining rGTP as Arg32 of HCV RdRp. Because these residues are on the loops, the side chains of Arg127 and Trp623 stick out the surface and only Thr624 and Thr627 replace the two proline rings for orientation, this kind of structure allows the network more tolerable than HCV. Maybe, these data conduce that preincubation with rGTP resulted in higher activities.",

            "text": "The remote surface site of the rGTP might play a role in activating de novo initiation, with an overall stimulation of RNA synthesis as a result (Bressanelli et al., 2002) . The rGTP binding at this site, in company with template RNA binding groove, helps to induce a conformational change of the enzyme that would be important for initiation (Ago et al., 1999; Blumenthal and Hill, 1980; Bressanelli et al., 1999 Bressanelli et al., , 2002 Luo et al., 2000; Oh et al., 1999) . We constructed another model of the polymerase with rGTP according to the structure of HCV RdRp containing an rGTP. Comparing this model with the unliganded polymerase model (see Section 2), we find that before the polymerase contacts with the rGTP, the \u2424-hairpin (\u242416-17), motif H and the preceding loop stay at the gate of the template tunnel and part of the loop 2 project into the tunnel, and thus this closed posture prevents templates from coming into the catalytic site (Fig. 7C) . On the contrary, the polymerase turns into an opened conformation by binding an rGTP at the site. The rGTP grips the \u2423-helices of the thumb domain and \u2423-helix A. As a result, the \u2424-hairpin is drawn from the tunnel in succession. Because of the joint, the loop 1 containing the \u2423A, the conformation changing of the thumb domain causes motif H and the preceding loop of the fingers domain to extend away from the tunnel, leaving room for RNA template (Fig. 7D ). Put another way, when the unliganded polymerase links to an rGTP at the site, it experiences the process of closing the hand to opening the hand.",

            "text": "We observe that the increase in template concentration of the RNA template had no significant assist on RNA synthesis when the concentration reached a certain level (Fig. 3A) . This limitation of template concentration may be caused by the specific structure of CSFV RdRp. The position of the template tunnel is based on the 6 polymerase-template complexes. Superposition of the central palm domain of CSFV RdRp with the corresponding region in 6 polymerase brings the fingers domains of two polymerases into good agreement. The entrance to the template channel in CSFV RdRp lies between the fingers and the thumb where \u2423 fingers and fingertips encircle a U-shape valley (Fig. 8) . Motif H and the preceding long loop have eight more residues including the three positively charged arginines than HCV containing a loop instead. As a result, the gate of the cavity appears smaller than HCV polymerase. The long loop floats near the gate of the RNA template tunnel, wiggle for controlling and helping the template come (Fig. 8) . Additionally, the \u2424 hairpin (\u242416-\u242417), that poliovirus and calicivirus polymerases do not contain, protrudes into the tunnel and affects the capacity. In addition, a segment of the C-terminal polypeptide of the thumb in CSFV RdRp occludes the template tunnel from the binding of template-rNTP duplexes (Fig. 8) . When the enzyme begins to react, this segment moves out of the template cleft moderately to allow RNA and nucleoside triphosphate to bind to the enzyme. These characters explain that the efficiency of replication cannot be heightened by changing the template concentration above a certain level. HIV-RT, calicivirus, poliovirus and 6 polymerases using an rNTP or proteinlinked primer and double-stranded template, have a smaller thumb domain, and thus, the capability of the tunnel is greater then CSFV RdRp. The fingers and thumb domains within these polymerases differ significantly and bring on facilitation of different initiation mechanisms (Hobson et al., 2001) .",

The thumb/fingertips interaction could play an important role in maintaining the fingers domain in the closed form in the absence of ligands via helix A, helix G, motif F and loop 1 because the loop 1 is at the tip of a long loop that could adapt to this type of change. When the RNA template presents, because of the flexibility of the loop 1, it is in the opened form for the bigger entrance and concave. This modest movement on binding of template seems necessary because there would not be enough room for an RNA single-stranded molecule to fit in the structure.

This rNTP will be the first nucleotide of the nascent RNA-strand. The incoming rNTPs are selected by base pairing with the base of the template and discriminated rNTP from dNTP by Asp350. The 3 -OH group of the primer rNTP attacks the \u2423-phosphates of the incoming rNTP to form a new phosphodiester bond. Successively, the nucleotidyl transfer reaction is repeated, and rNTPs are added to the nascent RNA-strand until the polymerase finishes copying the template.",
