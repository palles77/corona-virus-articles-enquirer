In this study, the efficacy of 4 antimicrobial respirators to decontaminate MS2, a surrogate for pathogenic viruses, was evaluated and compared with control N95 filtering face piece respirators, which did not contain any known antimicrobial components. Methods: MS2 containing droplet nuclei were generated using a Collison nebulizer and loaded onto respirator coupons at a face velocity of 13.2 cm/seconds for 30 minutes. The coupons were incubated at 2 different temperature and relative humidity (RH) conditions and analyzed for viable MS2 at different time intervals. Results: Results showed that log 10 reduction of MS2 was not statistically significant (P . .05) between the control and antimicrobial respirator coupons, when stored at 228C and 30% RH up to 20 hours. Coupons from 1 of the 4 antimicrobial respirators showed an average MS2 log 10 reduction of 3.7 at 378C and 80% RH for 4 hours, which was statistically significant (P # .05) compared with coupons from the control respirators. Conclusion: Results from this study suggest that MS2 virus decontamination efficacy of antimicrobial respirators is dependent on the antimicrobial agent and storage conditions.",

            "text": "Experts predict that an influenza pandemic is likely to occur, and, as a result, the federal government has instituted a number of initiatives to enhance pandemic influenza planning efforts. To minimize and delay the spread of an influenza pandemic, a number of nonpharmaceutical interventions that would be readily available at the onset of a pandemic are recommended by government agencies and nongovernment organizations. The use of respiratory protective devices is one intervention designed to reduce exposure to infectious influenza aerosols. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved respirators are also recommended for protection of health care workers against several other pathogenic microorganisms including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome, Bacillus anthracis, and others. 1, 2 Respirators contaminated by influenza or other infectious aerosol can become a potential source of transmission. Fomites are inanimate objects capable of aiding the dissemination of infectious organisms. Viruses can contaminate and survive in the inanimate environment, persist after drying, and become reaerosolized. [3] [4] [5] Use of respirators in infected environments can potentially result in the deposition of infectious agents on the surface as well as inner layers of the respirator that may cause its conversion to a fomite, thereby becoming a vehicle for direct or indirect transmission. Prior studies have demonstrated the survival of various infectious microorganisms (eg, bacteria [6] [7] [8] and fungi 9 ) on respirators, but little work has been done with respect to contamination of respirators by viruses. 10 These prior studies indicate that some bacteria and fungi can survive on respirator filters, but their survivability is dependent on the specific organism, filter material, and storage conditions.",

For example, a recent study addressed the issue of virus transmission among health care workers handling contaminated personal protective equipment (PPE). 11 In that study, respirators and other PPE including goggles, gowns, and gloves donned by volunteers were intentionally contaminated with MS2. Participants performed tasks such as measuring blood pressure on a mannequin and then removed PPE according to standard protocol. One-handed removal of respirator and goggle resulted in approximately 1-to 2-log 10 of MS2 (most probable number) transfer to hands. Removal of other PPE including gowns and gloves showed higher levels of contamination. Similarly, cross contamination of viruses by surface to hand 12 and hand to hand 13 have been reported. Handling rhinovirus-contaminated coffee cups and plastic tiles caused transmission of virus in some test subjects. 12 Similarly, hand-to-hand contact was shown to transfer rhinovirus infection more effectively than aerosols produced by cough, sneeze, and loud talk or prolonged exposure. 13 In another study, influenza A and B viruses survived for 24 to 48 hours on hard, nonporous surfaces such as stainless steel and plastics but only survived for ,8 to 12 hours on cloth, paper, and tissues. 14 The study also demonstrated that influenza A could be transferred from the environmental surfaces to the hands and survives long enough for self-inoculation to occur.",

            "text": "However, there is limited knowledge on the efficacy of antimicrobial respirators to reduce fomite potential. Among the studies reported in the literature, many employed iodine-treated filters to investigate microorganism viable removal efficiency using different techniques. [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] These studies investigated whether antimicrobial filter media was able to reduce the viable virus particles passing through the filter media by inactivation in addition to particle capture. This was done by comparing the number of viable virus particles that pass through the control and antimicrobial filters. The conclusion from these studies 18, 20, 21 was that viruses and bacteria were inactivated by iodine at the filter level. Interestingly, a recent study indicated that iodine released from the filter and dissolved in the virus extraction medium may also contribute to virus inactivation. 23 The authors also showed that the filter materials contained many MS2 particles after extraction, indicating the possibility for a fomite. Thus, it is of great scientific interest to focus on the question of whether the potential for the respirators to act as a fomite was reduced or not. Some limited studies have been reported on the survivability of spores, bacteria, and fungi on antimicrobial air filter media, 18 electrospun nanofiber webs, 24 activated carbon fibers, 25 military fabrics, 26 and surgical masks 17 after storage. These studies found that the storage conditions (time, temperature, humidity) played an important role in the efficacy of the antimicrobial agent. However, it is difficult to make generalizations across studies because they all used different test methods and each study evaluated only a single antimicrobial agent. Furthermore, none of these studies reported data on the viability of viral aerosols applied to the devices. Manufacturers often provide unpublished antimicrobial efficacy data obtained from third-party test laboratories using different test protocols for their products. For example, in some testing, a small volume of the microorganism suspension is applied on to filter swatches, whereas other tests use the whole respirator/ mask to load bioaerosol particles. There is a general need for a standardized protocol based on realistic test conditions for assessing the efficacy of antimicrobial respirators.",

MS2 virus reduction of the iodinated respirator coupon increased significantly at 378C and 80% RH (4 hours, Fig 2) as did the control N95 respirator coupons, consistent with previous studies that showed MS2 inactivation was maximal at 75% RH and less at 20% and 30% RH. 29, 30 However, coupons from antimicrobial respirator C were significantly different from the control N95 respirator coupons only for the tests done at 378C and 80% RH, suggesting that the MS2 decontamination effect of the coupons from the iodinated respirator may be increased due to the high RH and high temperature employed in our study. Previous studies suggested that MS2 remained in the solid particle state at low RH, and inactivation of MS2 in the solid particle state was less compared with the levels in the fluid conditions. 29, 30 This may be a reason why many types of viruses including influenza virus are maximally stable at a low RH environment. 33, 34 High temperature and RH also increased MS2 log 10 reduction compared with the low temperature and RH condition regardless of the respirator type. Taken together, the results suggest that iodine and high temperature and RH synergistically inactivated MS2 because this effect was not found for coupons from any of the antimicrobial respirators. Only coupons from antimicrobial respirator C showed a significant reduction of MS2 compared with the control coupons at 378C and 80% RH. The results are in agreement with a previous study that investigated the decontamination efficacy of iodine-treated filter media against bacterial spores. 18 Furthermore, comparing the results for respirator C to the controls for both storage conditions lends support to inactivation occurring on the respirator filter sample as opposed to in the extraction medium. This conclusion is further supported by the results from the toxicity assay showing that iodine released into the recovery medium was not directly interfering with the survival of MS2. This indicates that MS2 inactivation had occurred prior to the recovery of virus from coupons. However, one recent study reported that MS2 inactivation can occur in the extraction medium after removal of the virus from an iodinecoated filter. 23 Further studies in this area are needed. Iodine inactivation of microorganisms appears to involve different mechanisms. In one study, iodine inactivation of poliovirus was mediated by disruption of the capsid protein coat. 35 Results from a recent study employing isoelectric focusing of iodinated MS2 proteins suggested that iodine inactivation involved conformational changes to the protein coat. 36 Some studies showed that iodine reaction with sulfhydryl groups caused inactivation of enzymes. 37 Iodine also appears to cause nucleic acids damage in bacterial species previously. 38 One of the antimicrobial respirators (D) employed an ultraviolet (UV)-A (310 nm -400 nm), lamp (4W; emission maximum, 380 nm) to activate TiO 2 on the respirator placed approximately 15 cm distance. Coupons from this antimicrobial respirator showed no ability to render MS2 inactive more than the control at either storage condition. However, bacterial culture on Petri dish coated with TiO 2 when exposed to a UV-A light showed a significant increase in inactivation compared with the controls. 39, 40 This may be partly explained by the difference in the intensity of the UV-A on the target organism and other exposure conditions. In our study, access for UV-A light to the TiO 2 layer as well as free radicals to MS2 deposited in different layers 26 are limiting factors unlike the direct UV-A exposure to bacterial cultures in other studies. 39, 40 Alternately, the hydroxyl and oxygen radicals produced in the experimental setup were not sufficient enough to inactivate MS2. On the other hand, MS2 was shown to be highly sensitive to direct UV-C light (254 nm) compared with other virus types. 41, 42 This may be attributed to the difference in the wavelengths of the UV light used in those experiments. It is well-known that free radicals damage cells through mechanisms involving oxidative stress and damage of DNA 40 as well as RNA. 43 The absence of a significant inactivation of MS2 by UV-A and TiO 2 obtained in our study suggests the production of insufficient levels of free radicals to cause significant RNA damage.",

Other studies on antimicrobial surgical masks coated with a mixture of silver nitrate and titanium dioxide nanoparticles 17 and silver particle coated activated carbon fibers 24 demonstrated good antimicrobial properties against E coli and other bacteria, with complete inactivation occurring after 24 hours and 10 minutes of storage, respectively. In a previous report, MS2 virus resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline showed a slight (0.28 log 10 ) reduction upon exposure to silver (0.1 mg/L) for 130 minutes. 45 Silver also enhanced the effect of UV light-induced inactivation in a synergistic manner. Silver ion generated reactive oxygen species was found to inactivate microorganisms. 46 Similarly, silver nitrate inactivation of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 at concentrations 30 mmol/L was reported. 47 Another mechanism of heavy metals including silver is believed to be mediated by their ability to bind sulfhydryl groups of capsid proteins of viruses. 47 In this study, coupons from the respirator containing silver-copper based antimicrobial technology failed to show a statistically significant decontamination of MS2 compared with the controls. This may be partly explained by the difference in the test methodologies. In our study, MS2 was resuspended in 1% ATCC medium 271 for aerosolization and then in 100% medium 271 for subsequent procedures. The aerosol particles undergo desiccation to become droplet nuclei. The protein contained in the aerosol medium is concentrated through a reduction in volume of the aerosolized particles. 27 The high concentration of protein in the droplet nuclei can diminish the decontamination effect of silver-copper based antimicrobial technology on MS2 by competing/interfering with potential binding to sites including the capsid protein sulfhydryl groups of the virus. High concentration of many proteins is also known to inhibit the effect of antimicrobial agents including bleach 27 and other agents. 30 Contaminated respirators may act as fomites during handling (eg, donning or doffing the respirator) or reuse. In this study, a viral challenge was loaded by passing MS2 containing droplet nuclei with a mass median diameter of 141 nm through the respirator coupons. Under the conditions used in this study and a previous study, varying levels of MS2 virus may be deposited in different layers of the respirator. 27 However, significant amounts of virus containing droplet nuclei remain on the surface for cross contamination. MS2 virus loaded as droplet nuclei were found to survive for an extended period of time (.20 hours)-even for the antimicrobial respirators-at room temperature and low RH, consistent with other studies investigating the survivability of viruses on other porous substrates. 5 In practice, other studies have shown that MS2 can readily transfer from respirator to hand. 11 Because viruses can generally survive for extended periods of time and the time between respirator donning/doffing events can be short, the antimicrobial agent needs to be able to reduce viability within hours and preferably within minutes. If an effective antimicrobial respirator could be developed and validated, it may be possible to reduce the risks of handling of contaminated respirators because the likelihood of transferring active virus particles to the hand would be greatly diminished.",

In this study, MS2 resuspended in 1% ATCC medium 271 was aerosolized and loaded onto coupons.
