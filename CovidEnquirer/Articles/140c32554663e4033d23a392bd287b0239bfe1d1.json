In the Middle East and Arab countries, the burden of RSV-associated hospitalizations is not well characterized. We sought to determine the burden and clinical/epidemiological characteristics of RSV hospitalization in young children in Amman, Jordan. We investigated risk factors for severity including vitamin D levels. Methods: We conducted viral surveillance with clinical and demographic data in children <2 years admitted with respiratory symptoms and/or fever at the Al-Bashir Government Hospital from March16, 2010 to March 31, 2013. Nasal/throat swabs were obtained and placed into lysis buffer, and frozen at \u221280 \u2022 C until testing by real-time RT-PCR for 11 respiratory viruses. Heel stick blood or sera samples for 25hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels were obtained and sent to a central laboratory for mass spectrometry. Results: Of the 3168 children, >80% testing positive for one virus, with RSV the most common virus detected (44%). The RSV-associated hospitalization rate was highest in children <6 months with an annual range of 21.1-25.9 per 1000, compared to 6.0-8.0 in 6-11-month-olds and 1.6-2.5 in 12-23-month-olds. RSV-positive children compared with RSV-negative were more likely to be previously healthy without underlying medical conditions, less likely to be born prematurely, had a higher frequency of supplemental oxygen use, and had lower median vitamin D levels. Risk factors for oxygen use in RSV-positive children included underlying medical conditions, lack of breastfeeding, younger age, and higher viral load. Conclusion: RSV is a major cause of illness in hospitalized Jordanian children and is associated with increased severity compared to other respiratory viruses. Children with RSV in the Middle East would benefit from future RSV vaccines and antiviral therapy.",

Of the 728 subjects enrolled, >80% tested positive for a virus by RT-PCR, with 64% testing positive for RSV.

Wheezing on physical exam was categorized as none, end-expiratory, full expiratory or inspiratory, full expiratory and inspiratory, or not specified. Cyanosis was recorded as none, circumoral on crying only, circumoral at rest, generalized cyanosis at rest, or not specified. Documentation of microbiological data was obtained and viral identification laboratory results were recorded. Intensive care unit (ICU) stays included children who were either admitted directly to the ICU or were transferred in during the admission. Smoke exposure included both cigarette and/or nargalia (hookah pipe) exposure. Underlying conditions were collected and were categorized as the following: diabetes, heart disease, down's syndrome, kidney disease, sickle cell, cystic fibrosis, cancer, genetic/metabolic, cerebral palsy, neurological, mental retardation/developmental delay, seizure disorder, chronic diarrhea(e.g. >2 weeks), gastroesophageal reflux disease, immunodeficiency, asthma/reactive airway disease, and liver disease. We entered data into a standardized, secured REDCap TM (Research Electronic Data Capture, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA) database system [18] . Data quality checks were performed on at least 10% of the charts and all case report forms were verified after entry.",

In order to derive prevalence, estimates of the under 2-year-old Jordanian population were obtained from the World Bank online database, and the proportion of the population residing in Amman (35%) was taken from the 2012 national census [21] . These values were used in a binomial model to estimate the population of children <2 years of age in Amman in 2010-2012. The market share for Al-Bashir hospital was modeled as a random variable, and given a uniform prior distribution between 50 and 60% of the market share. Finally, to account for the enrollment effort, the probability of enrollment was set to 71.4% (5 of 7 days) and used in a binomial model for the number enrolled in the study. Prevalence was given a diffuse beta (1, 5) prior in all models. Each model was fitted using Markov chain Monte Carlo [22] methods as implemented in the PyMC 2.3 software package [23] . Models were run for 100,000 iterations, with the first 90,000 iterations conservatively discarded as burn-in. Models were checked for convergence using the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic [20] and for goodness of fit using posterior predictive checks [24] .",

            "text": "In our 2010-2013 surveillance window, RSV was a major cause of ARI hospitalizations in Jordanian children <2 years, with consistent annual peaks in January and February. Our study represents one of the largest cohort studies of RSV-infected hospitalized children, including within the Middle East [10] [11] [12] [13] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] . RSV is well-recognized cause of ARI globally [2] , but even comprehensive reports typically fail to include information from the Middle East region due to lack of published data. Therefore, our study fills a knowledge gap of RSV burden in the Arab region. Our estimates of hospitalized RSV incidence are consistent and even slightly higher than other estimates from developed and developing counties in which RT-PCR was used to calculate RSV-associated hospital rates. For instance, our estimated RSV-associated hospitalization rates in children <6 months (range, 21-25 per 1000) were higher than a population-based study of three US hospitals that reported RSV-associated hospitalization rates for children <6 months as averaging 17 per 1000 (range: 12.4-21.7) over a five-year period, in which 20% (564/2892) of the subjects were RSV-positive [44] . In a large population-based study of ARI in Egypt, of the 4993 children <5 years of age in which a specimen was collected, 518 (11%) of the children were positive by RSV by RT-PCR, with the highest portion in the 1-11 months group (45%). They estimated RSV-associated hospitalized rates in children 1-11 months as 17.45 per 1000 [42] . Of note, they excluded children <1 month of age, which most likely underestimated the burden of RSV. Other studies that estimated population-based RSV-associated hospital rates used less sensitive methods of RSV detection or only included children with children with severe ARI [45] [46] [47] [48] , making comparisons challenging. Our study highlights the importance of active surveillance over longer study periods and the advantage of sensitive molecular RSV detection techniques to accurately estimate the true burden of RSV hospitalizations. Not only are the hospitalization rates of RSV-positive children higher compared to RSV-negative, but the clinical characteristics are different and the severity of illness seems to be greater in these children [14, 44, 49, 50] . Prematurity and underlying medical conditions (e.g., heart or lung disease) are well-recognized risk factors for severe RSV [51] . However, the majority of our RSV-positive children were less likely to have been born prematurely or have an underlying medical condition compared to RSV-negative, consistent with other studies [34, 44] . In our cohort, RSV-positive children were more likely to be admitted with evidence of lower respiratory involvement (e.g., higher frequency of pneumonia, bronchiolitis and bronchopneumonia diagnoses and physical findings such as wheezing and retractions), present with hypoxemia and cyanosis, and require supplemental oxygen compared to RSV-negative children. Taken together, these results suggest that RSV is more likely to cause severe infection compared to other viruses.",

Using oxygen use as on of the indicators for severity, our results are consistent with other reports finding a significant higher odds ratios for oxygen use in RSV-positive children with higher RSV viral load [59, 60] , lack of breast feeding [61] , and younger age [44] . When also evaluating for ICU stay, mechanical ventilation, and length of stay, underlying medical conditions [51] and the admission diagnoses of pneumonia and suspected sepsis were other risk factors identified. Environmental tobacco smoke exposure is a known risk factor for serious RSV disease [62] . However, nearly 3/4 of our children were exposed to smoke; this high exposure for the cohort may explain why smoke exposure was not identified as an independent risk factor. Low vitamin D levels and clinical rickets have been associated with pneumonia and severe ARI [63] [64] [65] [66] . Low vitamin D levels were associated with supplemental oxygen use in our univariate model; however, in the multivariable model it was no longer significant. Therefore, further investigation and public health interventions to reduce modifiable risk factors such as vitamin D supplementation, smoking cessation programs, and encouraging breastfeeding are needed in our population. Prevention of RSV disease in young children may ultimately be possible with active immunization or maternal immunization, although no licensed RSV vaccine is currently available [67, 68] . The only preventive measure for RSV disease is palivizumab, an RSV monoclonal antibody, which reduces the risk of hospitalization caused by RSV in high-risk children [69] . Use of palivizumab is low in low and middle income countries due to the high cost of the drug. The vast majority of children hospitalized with RSV in our study were full term and previously healthy. Therefore, even if palivizumab were available widely in Jordan, only a few children would have been eligible and thus it would have little impact on overall RSV hospitalization rates. Other strategies to reduce RSVassociated hospitalization are needed, such as infant or maternal vaccination with future vaccines or antiviral therapies specific for RSV.",

Moreover, each subject had molecular viral testing performed for 11 viruses and systematic data collection. However, our study does have some limitations. The administration of oxygen and other treatments was at the clinicians' discretion and we only collected oxygen saturations at admission, so data may not reflect truly serious disease. Nevertheless, RSV children were more likely to have lower saturation at admission compared to RSV-negative children, suggesting that RSV is associated with increased morbidity. We did not collect current steroid use, except for inhaled steroids, prior or during admission, which may have an effect on viral load and/or fever presentation. Chest radiograph findings were reported by clinicians and were not confirmed by independent radiologists. Children who were classified as virus-negative may have had other viral infections that we did not measure. Bacterial cultures were recorded when ordered by clinicians, but their reliability was uncertain because many infants received antibiotics before admission (over 40%) and the microbiology laboratory is not open for 24 h, delaying the processing of many specimens and therefore, we are not able to comment reliably about viral-bacterial co-infections. However, a recent prospective US study found that the majority of LRTI in hospitalized young children were caused by viral pathogens rather than bacteria (45) . Since our RSV samples are not genotyped, we are unable to comment on differences in severity between RSV A and RSV B.",
