The United Nations now estimates that 3.9 billion people live in urban centres. The rapid influx of residents is however not universal and the developed countries are already urban, but the big rise in urban population in the next 30 years is expected to be in Asia and Africa. Urbanization leads to many challenges for global health and the epidemiology of infectious diseases. New megacities can be incubators for new epidemics, and zoonotic diseases can spread in a more rapid manner and become worldwide threats. Adequate city planning and surveillance can be powerful tools to improve the global health and decrease the burden of communicable diseases.",

Living in a city can provide you with several advantages, such as the possibility for higher education, a new job with higher income, the security of better health care, and the safety of social services. In 2014, the United Nations estimated that 54% of the world's population, 3.9 billion, lived in urban centres (1) . Economic growth for countries has been linked to urbanization and countries with high per capita income are among the most urbanized, whereas countries with low per capita income are the least urbanized (2) . The financial and political power is often concentrated in the cities, which leads to unique possibilities for action and quick response if needed.",

However, the meaning of the word 'urban' does not have a universal definition. A wide variety of different interpretations can be found in various countries, and often they do not share the same understanding. Different versions could be: living in the capital, economic activities in the region, population size, or even density. The lack of a universal definition makes it hard to compare different countries and cities in regard to public health and the burden and impact of infectious diseases (4) . Many of the studies conducted address the differences between urban and rural areas, and do not compare different urban settings. It can thus be difficult to get a global overview and get a better understanding of the burden of infectious diseases in these specific environments. Cities from around the world can also be very heterogeneous and the local diseases and health challenges can greatly differ. The challenges for one city can be completely different for another location (5) .",

Approximately half of the world's population now live in these urban centres. The two inhabited continents, which currently are the least urbanized, are Asia and Africa, with respectively 48 and 40% of the population living in cities. These percentages are expected to rise dramatically by the year 2050 to 64 and 56% respectively (1) . In the last decade, the growth in the urban population has been the highest in Asia, adding 0.88 million urban migrants per week. Africa was the second highest contributor with 0.23 million. The total figure of new urban residents per week during the last decade was on average 1.2 million. It is in Africa and Asia where the current rapid growth is taking place. 30 years are that almost all of the population growth will be in urban areas, but the growth in developed countries is expected to remain largely unchanged (2) . Chronic illnesses have been increasing in importance for the developing world. Worldwide the leading causes of death in 2011 were ischaemic heart disease followed by stroke, lower respiratory infections, chronic obstructive lung disease, and diarrhoeal diseases. However, if you look at the list for low-income countries, infectious diseases still have a profound impact. The top three causes of death in these settings are all infectious diseases: lower respiratory infections, HIV/AIDS, and diarrhoeal diseases (7) . Many of the lower income countries are expected to have a major growth among the urban population, which leads to considerable challenges for the governments and health care to keep up to pace and develop their social services and health care as these regions grow.",

Different risk factors in the urban environment can, for example, be poor housing which can lead to proliferation of insect and rodent vector diseases and geohelminthiases. This is connected to inadequate water supplies as well as sanitation and waste management. All contribute to a favourable setting for both different rodents and insects which carry pathogens and soil-transmitted helminth infections. If buildings lack effective fuel and ventilation systems, respiratory tract infections can also be acquired. Contaminated water can spread disease, as can poor food storage and preparation, due to microbial toxins and zoonoses (2) . The density of inhabitants and the close contact between people in urban areas are potential hot spots for rapid spread of merging infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the avian flu. Criteria for a worldwide pandemic could be met in urban centres, which could develop into a worldwide health crisis (8) . Adequate city planning can be a key factor for better overall health, and such considerations must be in the mind of the governing bodies.",

In general, the urban health is better, but in some areas, it can actually be worse compared to certain rural environments (8) . Of the estimated 3 billion people living in urban centres, about one-third live in slum areas (9) . The ever-changing environment of cities has made certain infectious diseases both emerge and re-emerge. Pathogens which adapt to urban environments from rural settings can spread in a more rapid manner, and be a greater burden to the health care services (2) . This review article examines the urban world and how the current rapid urbanization around the world is affecting the epidemiology of emerging infectious diseases. Currently the most rapid growth in urban population is taking place in the developing countries, and poses many different challenges compared to traditional highincome countries. This review focuses on these growing regions and their implications and how emerging infectious diseases affect the community.",

However, it is not only different cities that can have completely diverse standards of infrastructure and social security. The same city can provide very varying conditions for their residents. Living in the slums compared to more wealthy neighbourhoods, will expose the inhabitants to different risks. Traditionally cities can offer many advantages compared to rural settings, but under certain circumstances they can rather be a health hazard. The rapid migrations of people to cities can lead to overcrowding, which can generate slums or shanty towns. These slums are characterized by poor housing, lack of fresh water, and bad sanitation facilities (2) . All of these shortages can be a threat to the residents' health and be a possible breeding ground for infectious diseases. The location of slums are often outside of the city centres, in more hazardous locations and the population feels a lack of social and economic opportunities compared with other residents. In sub-Saharan Africa, 62% of the urban population in 2012 lived in shanty towns (2) . For example, in 2009, 96% of the urban population in Central African Republic lived in these slums (6) . In Kenya's capital Nairobi, 60% of the population lives in slums, and child mortality there is 2.5 times greater than other parts of the city (9). The community and health care services have great challenges to provide the entire population with equal and adequate service. The collected parties need to be aware of the differences in threats with respect to infectious diseases, both at the local and governmental levels.",

The rate of tuberculosis has traditionally been higher in urban centres compared to rural (14, 15) . Studies in slum settlements in Dhaka City, Bangladesh, indicate a high prevalence of tuberculosis, which was almost twice as high compared to the overall national average and four times higher than the overall urban levels (16) . However, different patterns can be seen in different countries; for example, in Poland the rates of tuberculosis have shown only slightly lower incidence in rural population compared to urban, 21.9 per 100,000 versus 22.4 per 100,000 respectively (17) . Tuberculosis in the United States has declined in the twentieth century, and several factors such as improved nutrition status, socioeconomic status, overall public health, and new drug regimens have been thought to play a major role. However, in the mid-1980s a resurgence occurred which reached its peak in 1992, especially in urban areas among the homeless and incarcerated population (18) . The knowledge regarding symptoms, transmission, and prevention has been shown to be greater among the urban population in Pakistan's Punjab province compared to the rural population. Health-seeking behaviour was also better among the urban population, in the aspect of when to seek medical advice for early diagnosis and potential treatment (19) . Information about infectious diseases and how they spread in the community can help the individuals to protect themselves, but knowledge about the slums and the infectious diseases panorama is also crucial for local physicians. They need to know how to look for the correct diagnosis, even if their diagnostic tools might be limited. The right hypothesis from the start in these cases is even more important.",

These infections are among the most important causes of physical and intellectual growth retardation in the world and have a major impact on public health (22) . Good hygiene practices and good sanitary conditions have lowered the prevalent levels of contamination. In the Brazilian city of Salvador, with a population of 2.5 million, an improvement of sewerage coverage from 26 to 80% of the households led to an estimated overall reduction of diarrhoeal diseases of 22% (23) . Neglected tropical diseases can cause substantial health problems in developing countries, and some of these diseases have a faecal-oral transmission pathway. Examples of such diseases could be schistosomiasis, trachoma, and soiltransmitted helminthiases. Improved sanitation could contribute to a significant improvement for the public health. In many countries, however, the focus is on treatment by medication and not improved sanitation. The reason could be that it would be much more expensive to carry out the necessary infrastructural improvements (24) . Safe drinking water and proper sanitary facilities must be taken into account in city planning. Factors like this can potentially have a profound positive effect in lowering infectious diseases with a faecal\u00c1oral route. However, the real challenge lies in the uncontrolled growth of slum settlements.",

Chagas disease affects an estimated 8 million people every year, and is an important health challenge in Latin America. In recent decades, progress has been made to reduce the burden of disease, by vector control, screening blood donors, improved housing, and epidemiological surveillance. Chagas disease is a growing health problem in non-endemic areas because of population movements (26) . It is estimated that 300,000 individuals in the United States are infected (27) and the most affected country in Europe, Spain, is thought to have 45,000\u00c167,000 cases (28) .

Leptospirosis has traditionally been perceived as a primarily rural disease, but the incidence in urban centres is increasing (31, 32) . In Chinese cities, the incidence of Seoul hantavirus haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome has been linked to urban growth, growing rat population, and increase rat\u00c1human contact (33) .

Recent studies have estimated 390 million cases each year, and the burden is the highest in India with onethird of all the new infections (37) . Several factors have played a big role in the escalation, such as urbanization, globalization, and lack of mosquito control. Aedes aegypti lay their eggs in artificial water containers made by humans, which is a key component in the urban transmission cycle. The adaption of dengue through its vector has made dengue an infectious disease on the clear rise (38) . Thailand is a country with all four serotypes of dengue virus, and the epidemics of dengue haemorrhagic fever have shown a possible correlation to originate from the urban capital of Bangkok and then spread geographically in an outward manner to more rural settlements and provinces. A model to understand this mechanism could lead to more effective use of the health systems in the affected areas (39) . Dengue has become a global problem and is no longer restricted to the developing world. Despite better knowledge, it seems tough to control the vector, which has adapted to the urban environment and living close to people.

The disease was first recognized in wildlife markets in Guandong, China. Investigations have found this SCoV from the Himalayan palm civets in live-animal markets in the region. The first cases of SARS reportedly occurred in individuals who handled these animals to prepare exotic food, and the virus is thought to have crossed over to their human host (47) . SARS could then spread throughout the world by, for example, international travel. It spread in urban dwellings in large cities and in wellequipped city hospitals. Public fear of travelling led to considerable economic losses that affected entire countries (48) . The example of SARS shows that food markets in southern China can be the origin of a worldwide health crisis.

Measurements to stop the spread need to be taken at the original location, but knowledge about the specific disease needs to be passed on to the global community and local health workers in other parts of the world. This global surveillance and alert system needs to be fast and efficient to, if possible, reduce the impact. The expected rise of travel makes it critical for the future global health and the possibility to react in time for possible threats. Zoonotic disease a challenge for the future Rapid and sometimes uncontrolled urbanization can, in certain circumstances, lead to closer encounters with wildlife. Human influence on the ecosystems creates meeting points for new and potential zoonotic diseases, which could have a profound impact for both local and global health. The global trends of urbanization push people to previously untouched ecosystems. New housing in the outskirts of big cities can potentially be meeting points for new and already known zoonotic diseases. Of 335 emerging infectious diseases, which have been recognized between 1940 and 2004, more than 60% have been zoonotic diseases (55) . Living in close contact to domesticated animals and hunt for 'bush-meat' can also be risk factors for an infectious disease to make the jump from the animal host to humans. Major deforestation creates closer contact between humans and bats and even primates, who can potentially be host for 'new' viruses. A better understanding, surveillance, and prevention of zoonotic diseases would be of great value, to both prevent and manage this upcoming threat for global health. Hot spots for this transmission have been found and they often correlate where the process of urbanization is on the clear rise (56) . Even if it is not always the urban population who is at the front of new encounters with wildlife, it can still have an effect on urban health. The trend of people moving to cities are at the highest, where many of these new encounters with ecosystems take place, and infectious diseases can be introduced to these growing urban environments. The sometimes uncontrolled growth of cities pushes residents to untouched ecosystems when new housing expands.",

            "text": "Ebola virus disease (EVD) has had a profound impact on the world in 2014. Since the spring of 2014, the world has witnessed an unprecedented epidemic of this zoonotic disease. The hub of the epidemic has been the three countries in Western Africa: Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea. It all began in December 2013 in Guinea, in the providence of Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou, in the eastern rainforest region. The disease transmission in the capital of Conakry is thought to be the first major urban setting for EVD (57) . WHO was first notified of the EVD outbreak in March 2014, and on August 8, the WHO declared the current situation as 'public health emergency of international concern' (58). Before, EVD outbreaks in central Africa had been limited in size and geographical spread to a few hundred persons, mostly in remote areas and not large urban settings (59) . The centre of the epidemic (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone) has, as many of their neighbouring countries, a large population living in rural settings; only 36, 49, and 40% of their population live in urban centres (60\u00c162). The population is, however, highly interconnected in these countries with travel and crossborder traffic, with good road access between rural and urban settings. These communications have made the magnitude of the EVD epidemic possible. Despite cases of EVD in Nigeria and Lagos, a megacity with 20 million inhabitants, the transmission has been limited, which proves that implementation of control measures can limit the transmission (63) . The mortality rate has been high in previous outbreaks, up to 90% (64) . The fatality rate in the West Africa epidemic has been estimated to around 70% for Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone when data for patients with recorded definitive clinical outcomes (63) . This unprecedented epidemic points out the importance of better surveillance, understanding, and preventions measures for this potentially deadly virus. Ebola virus (EBOV) is thought to be a zoonotic disease, and fruit bats are under investigation to be the natural reservoir. EBOV sequences have been found in these animals near the human outbreaks which implies where the virus might originate from (65, 66) . Closer contact with humans and fruit bats are thus risks for a new global health crisis and the severity of an Ebola epidemic has already been witnessed. The high costs, both from an economic and overall health perspective, have affected entire countries and have even cost lives on the other side of the earth.",

WHO estimates 198 million cases (124\u00c1283 million) of malaria and 584,000 deaths (367,000\u00c1755,000) in 2013. The highest mortality rates have been shown to be closely linked to poor countries with a low gross national income (GNI) per capita (67) . Estimations have been made that nearly 25% of the total African population, 200 million, currently live in urban settings where malaria transmission is a reality. The annual incidence is estimated at 24.8\u00c1103.2 million cases of clinical malaria among the urban population in Africa (68) . The relationship between the malaria mosquito vector and the human host determines the burden of morbidity and mortality. This interface is dependent on many different factors and the degree of urbanization is an important one. A significant reduction in malaria transmission has been observed over the last century. Increased urbanization and decreased transmission have correlated in several different studies (69) . However, whether it was the increased urbanization that led to a reduction in transmission or the malaria reduction that led to development that promoted urbanization of societies is a challenge to determine (70) . A clear connection has been shown between reduced transmission of Plasmodium falciparum and urbanization; however, for Plasmodium vivax it is less obvious. For P. vivax, a connection has been found globally and in Asia and Africa; inconsistent results, however, were found in the Americas. Several possibilities could explain these incoherent results, such as more widespread transmission of P. vivax, lower transmission intensity, the wide distribution in Asia, and high prevalence of Duffy negativity in Africa, which protects against P. vivax (71). The overall decrease of the burden of malaria has been a positive effect of urbanization, but the exact mechanisms are not yet known. However, it seems that urbanization can have a favourable influence.",

In a study in Uganda, 58% of the urban group compared to 53% in the rural areas were fully immunized, but polio vaccine was given to 51% in the urban group and 52% in the rural group (74) . Immunization coverage can also vary considerably among different settings, not only between rural and urban surroundings, but also between urban, rural, and slum settlements. In Changdigarh, a union territory of India, full immunization of children at the age of 2 was 30% in slums, 74% in urban, and 62.5% in rural settings (75) . It shows that there can be a wide variety of reasons for immunization status among the population in different regions and countries of the world.
