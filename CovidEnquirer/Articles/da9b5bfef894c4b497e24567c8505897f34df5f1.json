Strains of TCoV that were pathogenic in poults and nonpathogenic in chickens did not adapt to cause disease in chickens. Comparative genomics revealed two recombination sites that replaced the spike gene in IBV with an unidentified sequence likely from another coronavirus, resulting in cross-species transmission and a pathogenicity shift. Following emergence in turkeys, TCoV diverged to different serotypes through the accumulation of mutations within spike. This is the first evidence that recombination can directly lead to the emergence of new coronaviruses and new coronaviral diseases, emphasizing the importance of limiting exposure to reservoirs of coronaviruses that can serve as a source of genetic material for emerging viruses.",

They can cause respiratory, enteric, and in some cases hepatic and neurological diseases in a wide variety of animals and in humans. Three groups have historically been recognized based on antigenic and genetic characteristics. However, after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the group 2 coronaviruses were split into subgroup 2a containing previously recognized group 2 viruses and subgroup 2b containing SARS-CoV (Gorbalenya et al., 2004) . Studies to identify the animal reservoir for SARS-CoV led to the discovery of a diverse population of coronaviruses related to groups 1 and 2 in bats (Chiroptera) Woo et al., 2006) .",

These novel group 3 coronaviruses led to the proposal of subgroups 3a, 3b, and 3c (Woo et al., 2009b) . Group 3related viruses have also been found in an Asian leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) and Chinese ferret badgers (Melogale moschata), but not in bats (Dong et al., 2007; Woo et al., 2006) . It was suggested that wild bird species are the reservoir for the group 3 coronaviruses, which are primarily avian in origin, whereas bats are the reservoir for the group 1 and 2 mammalian coronaviruses (Woo et al., 2009a) . This observation fits well with the view that, in addition to close contact, RNA viruses more readily undergo cross-species transmission when the two host species are closely related (Holmes and Rambaut, 2004) . These studies indicate that an enormous, previously unrecognized reservoir for coronaviruses exists among animals, which is not unlike the reservoir that exists for influenza viruses in animals.",

Given the vast capacity for coronaviruses to change, it is not surprising that host switching leading to new diseases has occurred among coronaviruses Rest and Mindell, 2003; Stavrinides and Guttman, 2004; Woo et al., 2009a; Zhang et al., 2005) , most notably the abrupt emergence of SARS-CoV in people in southern China in 2002, which quickly spread to 27 countries (including the United States) and resulted in 8096 cases and 744 deaths (http://www.who.int/csr/ sars/country/table2004_04_21/en/index.html). However, recombination events in coronaviruses are not thought to play a key role in cross-species transmission since it appears that recombination events in the SARS-CoV occurred prior to the jump into humans (Hon et al., 2008) . Rather, the emergence of new coronaviruses and coronaviral diseases are believed to be due to adaptive evolution (Holmes and Rambaut, 2004) .",

            "text": "Previously unrecognized coronaviruses have emerged in animals. In 1995, a coronavirus was isolated from the enteric tract of turkeys with diarrhea in North Carolina and quickly spread throughout commercial turkeys in the USA (Guy, 2008) . That virus was found to be similar to IBV based on cross-reactive antibodies (Guy, 2000) . IBV causes a highly contagious upper-respiratory tract disease in chickens and is not known to infect or cause disease in turkeys (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008) . Several studies conducted on various TCoV isolates showed that the order of the genes at the 3\u2032 end of the genome was similar to IBV (Breslin et al., 1999; Cavanagh et al., 2001; Guy, 2000; Li et al., 2005; Stephensen et al., 1999; Velayudhan et al., 2003) . One of those genes, the coronavirus spike glycoprotein gene, codes for a membrane-bound protein found on the surface of the virus that is involved in attachment and entry into the host cell and therefore plays a key role in host specificity (Holmes et al., 1993) . In the group 3 coronaviruses, the spike glycoprotein is post-translationally cleaved into an S1 subunit that contains the receptor binding domain and an S2 subunit that is non-covalently bound to S1 and contains a transmembrane domain that anchors the spike to the viral membrane. Since IBV does not infect and cause disease in turkeys, we sequenced the TCoV spike glycoprotein gene and found that it was not related to IBV (GenBank accession nos. AY342356 and AY342357). More recently, TCoV was reported to be closely related to IBV across the entire genome with the exception of the spike gene, suggesting that TCoV emerged from IBV (Cao et al., 2008; Gomaa et al., 2008) and Lin et al. (2004) was the first to suggest that recombination may account for the unique spike gene in TCoV. However, the origin of the spike gene sequence in TCoV is unknown.",

To determine if TCoV could revert back to pathogenicity in chickens we passaged the viruses in 1-day-old chicks by infecting the birds, re-isolating the virus from the GI tract and giving it to additional 1-day-old chicks. No clinical signs or lesions were observed when either virus was passaged in 1-day-old chickens. The TCoV/TX-1038/98 virus was detected in pooled GI tracts on day 3 for passages 1 and 2, and on day 5 for passage 3. The TCoV/TX-1038/98 virus could not be detected in the pooled GI tracts from the fourth passage so the experiment was terminated. The TCoV/TX-GL/01 virus was detected on day 3 after the first passage in 1-day-old SPF chickens but could not be detected in the subsequent passage. No clinical signs, lesions, or virus were detected in any of the contact exposed chickens for any of the passages. Finally, the last virus-positive passage of TCoV/TX-1038/98 (third passage) and TCoV/TX-GL/01 (first passage) in chickens were examined for pathogenicity in 1-day-old poults and both were found to induce clinical signs and lesions similar to the original virus before passage in chickens (data not shown). The above data show that TCoV does not adapt or revert to cause disease in chickens.",

The spike glycoprotein gene was examined for nucleotide and amino acid changes associated with passage of TCoV in 19-day-old embryonating turkey eggs. No sequence changes were observed between the initial sequence determined for passage 1 and passages 8, 10, 13, 14, 17, 18, 20, and 30 (Table 3) . Between passages 30 and 40, we found 7 nucleotide changes in the spike glycoprotein gene with 6 changes in S1 and 1 change in S2 (G2269A resulting in amino acid change Val757Ile). Only two nucleotide changes, both in S1, resulted in non-synonymous changes at residues Ser65Pro and Asn84Lys. Between passages 40 and 49, we observed that 5 of the 6 changes detected in passage 30 were conserved, one reverted to the original sequence, and there were 4 new changes. Between passages 49 and 50, we observed 7 conserved changes, 2 reversions, and 4 new changes. Between passages 50 and 52, we observed 7 conserved changes, 6 reversions to nucleotides observed in previous passages, and 2 new changes. Predicted residue changes in S1 between passages 30 and 40 included 2 changes (Ser65Pro and Asn84Lys); between passages 40 and 49, there were 1 conserved (Pro65), 1 reversion (Lys84Asn), and 3 new changes (Thr91Ser, Gly127Asp, Asn135His); between passages 49 and 50, there were 4 conserved (Pro65, Asn84, Ser91, and Asp127), 1 reversion (His135Asn), and 1 new change (Ile138Thr); and between passages 50 and 52, there were 2 conserved (Pro65 and Asn84), 3 reversions (Ser91Thr, Asn135His, and Thr138Ile), and 2 new changes (Asp127Ser and Gln239Arg). We sequenced all structural genes for passages 8 and 40 of TCoV/TX-1038/98 and found only 1 nucleotide change in a structural protein gene other than spike, which was a synonymous change that occurred in the nucleocapsid gene (data not shown).",

Virus could not be detected in the chicks following the 3rd passage of TCoV/TX-1038/98 or after only 1 passage of TCoV/TX-GL/01. Furthermore, TCoV was not transmissible among chickens since it was not detected in any of the contact control birds. These data indicate that exposure/ passage of TCoV in chickens did not result in selection for changes sufficient to maintain infection and replication in chickens nor did it lead to transmission of the virus among chickens. Based on this finding and the observation that the TCoV spike glycoprotein only bears about 35% similarity to the IBV spike glycoprotein, it appears likely that a recombination event that replaced the spike glycoprotein gene rather than selection of a virus subpopulation or genetic changes was responsible for the emergence of TCoV.

These serologically distinct strains of TCoV could be the result of adaptive evolution driven by the host immune response. Adaptive evolution is the process by which genetic changes in the viral genome leading to a more fit virus population become fixed over time and has been reported for many coronaviruses (Hasoksuz et al., 2007; Lee and Jackwood, 2001; Shi et al., 2006; Tang et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2006) . Although all coronaviruses undergo adaptive evolution, it is interesting that only the group 3 coronaviruses, IBV and now based on our data TCoV, have thus far been reported to diverge within the spike glycoprotein gene to generate multiple different serotypes. Studies on divergent SARS-CoVs showed that pseudoviruses expressing different human derived SARS-CoV spike glycoproteins were all equally neutralized with the exception of one virus (GD03), indicating that possibly two serotypes may be present (Enjuanes et al., 2008) . In addition, feline enteric coronavirus (FECoV) has been reported to have two serologically distinct types, but nearly all of the naturally occurring FECoV viruses are type I (Tekes et al., 2008) . It is not clear why divergence to multiple different serotypes appears to be a unique characteristic for at least two of the group 3 coronaviruses, but elucidating the advantage of this phenomenon could lead to better vaccination control strategies.",

            "text": "Typically, IBV is passaged in embryonating eggs to attenuate the virus for use as a modified live vaccine in chickens. To determine structural protein sequence changes associated with multiple passages in eggs, we passaged two different TCoV strains in 18-day-old embryonating turkey eggs and found that few or no amino acid changes were observed for the first 20 to 30 passages (Table 3) . Between 30 and 52 passages in embryonating eggs, we found 4 amino acid changes that became fixed, 3 that reverted, and 1 that was variable in the S1 subunit of the spike glycoprotein. No nonsynonymous changes and only 1 synonymous change (nucleocapsid gene) were observed in the other structural proteins of the virus. It is not clear why no changes were observed in the virus for the earlier passages in embryonating eggs. Coronaviruses have a high mutation rate that has been estimated to be 1 \u00d7 10 \u2212 3 synonymous substitutions/site/year (Holmes, 2009) . Studies on the genetic changes associated with adaption of the SARS-CoV to palm civets and subsequently to humans showed that mutations were being fixed at a high rate following cross-species transmission then slowed in the later stages of the epidemic (Kan et al., 2005; Song et al., 2005) . Assuming the evolutionary dynamics of coronaviruses result in an increase in observed sequence variation when introduced into a new host, one would expect to see a high number of changes in the first few passages in embryonating eggs. It is possible that changes occurred in the 1a and 1ab polyprotein genes since we did not examine that area of the genome, but it is well known that the highest rate of change is observed in the spike glycoprotein because it is involved in attachment and entry into the host cell, so some level of Fig. 2 . Neighbor-Joining method used to infer evolutionary history using full genomic sequence data for available TCoV isolates. The bootstrap consensus sub-tree was constructed from 1000 replicates (percentage of replicate trees in which associated strains clustered together are presented at nodes). The p-distance scale is presented at the bottom of the figure. Different genetic groups are indicated at the right of the figure. adaptive change would be expected in spike (Cavanagh et al., 2005) . We did not examine the sequence of the TCoV strains prior to the first passage in embryonating eggs because there was not enough of the virus present. Therefore, it is possible that selection of a viral subpopulation following only one passage in embryonating eggs could have occurred leading to a reasonably fit population of viruses that then underwent adaptive evolution. In a previous study, we found that a more fit subpopulation of an embryonating egg-adapted vaccine virus for IBV was selected after only one passage in chickens (McKinley et al., 2008) . Since deleterious as well as advantageous changes can occur with extremely high mutation rates, such as those rates found in coronaviruses, it is possible that minor more fit coronavirus subpopulations would then take several passages before becoming the predominant species (Holmes, 2009) . It is interesting to note that attenuation of pathogenic IBV strains by passage in embryonating eggs takes more than 50 passages and can take up to 75 or 100 passages (Jackwood et al., 2003) .",

Two different alignment methods and four different methods of constructing phylogenetic trees, resulted in trees with nearly identical topology. When other available group 3 coronavirus full-length genomes were examined (Fig. 1) , three major clades were observed supporting recently published data indicating that the group 3 coronaviruses can be divided into three subgroups (Woo et al., 2009b) ; subgroup 3a containing TCoV and IBV isolates, subgroup 3b containing viruses isolated from a bulbul, a thrush, and a munia, and subgroup 3c containing a virus isolated from a beluga whale (SW1).

Recombination detection analysis on TCoV isolates (Fig. 4) showed that recombination occurred in the 3\u2032 end of gene 1ab (nt. position 20,173) and at about 177 nucleotides from the 3\u2032 end of spike (nt. position 23,849), essentially inserting a different spike gene into TCoV. That result was supported by the amino acid alignments used to construct the phylogenetic relationships of virus proteins shown in Fig. 3 . Similarities between spike glycoprotein sequences and the locations of the crossover sites among TCoVs isolated over time indicate that this was a one-time event, which led to the emergence of TCoV from its closest IBV ancestor. This is the first evidence that recombination in corona-viruses directly led to cross-species transmission and the emergence of a new disease. Although SARS-CoV was shown to be a recombinant virus, this recombination event was reported to have occurred before the cross-species spread to intermediate hosts (raccoon dog, Nyctereutes procyonoides and Asian palm civet, Paradoxurus hermaphroditus) and ultimately to humans (Hon et al., 2008) . Therefore, recombination is likely not the direct cause of emergence of SARS.",

Similar to what was observed for the emergence and evolution of the SARS-CoV, a high rate of molecular evolution is observed when viruses switch hosts (Song et al., 2005) . This result appears to contradict our observation above that little or no change in the structural proteins of TCoV occurs during the first 30 to 50 passages in eggs. Perhaps a low rate of molecular evolution occurred in the eggs because the cells lining the GI tract of an 18-day-old turkey embryo are not substantially different from the cells in the GI tract of a poult or because there are other yet to be identified constraints on these molecules.",

Although the source of the genetic material making up the TCoV spike is not known at this time, it is likely from another coronavirus because the makeup of the TCoV spike resembles that of other coronavirus surface glycoproteins, including a receptor binding domain, cleavage site, fusion peptide, heptad repeats, and a transmembrane domain (Bosch et al., 2003) . Our data clearly show that the mechanism driving crossspecies transmission in this group 3 coronavirus was a double crossover event that replaced the spike gene, followed by adaptive evolution to create different serotypes. Thus, it appears that emergence of new coronaviruses and coronaviral diseases can occur through recombination as well as selection upon mutations (Holmes, 2009; Holmes and Rambaut, 2004) . Preventing the emergence of new coronaviruses therefore requires that we identify and limit exposure to reservoirs of coronaviruses that can serve as a source of genetic material for emerging viruses. Elucidating the molecular events associated with cross-species transmission and pathogenicity shifts provides valuable insight into the mechanisms behind coronaviral evolutionary biology. With that knowledge, we will be able to develop better control measures that prevent vaccine failures, antiviral drug resistance, and the emergence of new coronaviral diseases in animals and humans.",
