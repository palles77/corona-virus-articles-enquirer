            "text": "Rotavirus infections occur worldwide and are an important cause of enteric disease in many species (Holmes, 1979) . In young farm animals the morbidity and mortality can be high, causing considerable damage. In cattle, vaccination against rotavirus-induced diarrhoea has been attempted but the results were usually disappointing (Mebus eta]., 1973; De Leeuw et aI., 1980b; Snodgrass et al., 19801 Snodgrass et al., 1982; BDrki et aI., 1983) or still need confirmation under field conditions (Saif et aI., 1983; Saif et al., 1984) . Part of the problem may be the empirical basis on which such vaccines and vaccination methods have to be developed, due to an incomplete understanding of the mucosal immune system. Particularly in cattle, only limited information is available and some of the results reported appear to be conflicting. For instance, whereas in most species [gA is the predominant immunoglobulin (Ig)-isotype* in secretions (Tomasi and Zigelbaum, 19631 Heremans, 1974) , IgG 1 has been found to be the major isotype in the milk of cows and in the intestinal contents of 2-week-old calves (Newby and Bourne, 1976; Butler, 1983) . [gA levels increased with age but IgG 1 was still the major isotype in the intestine of adult cattle. Newby and Bourne (1976) also demonstrated the presence of a high percentage of IgG 1 containing ceils in the small intestine. In contrast, Porter et aI. (1972) reported the predominance of IgM (and in some animals of IgG 2) in intestinal loop secretions of pre-ruminant calves. IgM-containing ceils indeed predominate in the intestine of young calves but they appeared to be outnumbered by IgAcontaining cells in older calves and adult cattle (Allen and Porter, 1975) . This latter observation is in agreement with the results of Cripps et aI. (1974) who found IgA to be the major isotype in intestinal loop secretions of adult sheep. As illustrated by these conflicting results, the mucosal immune system of cattle needs further study. This is particularly important as there is little doubt that resistance to enteric infection is largely independent of circulating antibody but relies on passively or actively acquired immunity in the gut (Mebus et aI., 1973; Snodgrass and Wells, 1978a) .",

With conventional antisera against bovine immunoglobulin (Big) isotypes that appeared to be specific in agar gel precipitation techniques we observed marked cross-reactions in sensitive ELISAs. To circumvent these problems we produced monoclona] antibodies (MCA) to BIg-isotypes and characterized them in ELISAs (Van Zaane and I3zerman, 1984) . MCAs specific for [gOt, IgG 2 and lgA were obtained, while MCAs against IgM showed a weak cross-reaction with [gA. The MCAs were applied in isotype-specific ELISAs for the detection of lgG1, lgG2, IgM and [gA rota~irus antibody. E~idence was presented that these tests were isotype-specific, except for the [gM test, which showed at most 3% cross-reacti~ity with IgA rotavirus antibodies.",

When isotype-specific reagents are used as conjugates, competition between isotypes for the limited amount of antigen (inter-isotype competition) can pre~ent the detection of an isotype with a relatively low antibody concentration or affinity. Another disadvantage of the ELISA is the possible interference of rheumatoid factors. Both problems can be circumvented by applying isotype-specific reagents as catching antibodies. In this case, howe~er, competition within a particular isotype for the limited amount of catching antibody can occur (intra-isotype competition). Based on the evaluation of these competition effects optimum EL]SAs were selected (Van Zaane and I3zerman, 1984) .",

            "text": "Another important aspect of this study is the evaluation of the immune response after oral application of a modified live rotavirus vaccine in young calves. The results obtained with group A and B calves, fed colostrum without specific antibodies, suggest that IgM is the main antibody-isotype responsible for recovery from and early protection against viruses causing enteric disease. In the field, nearly all adult cattle possess rotavirus antibodies and can transfer these via colostrum and milk to their offspring. Evidence has been presented that effective oral vaccination of calves against rotavirus-induced diarrhoea is hindered by the presence of these lacteal antibodies , 1980b; BOrki et al., 1983; De Leeuw and Tiessink, 1984) . Our results with group C and D calves (Figs. 5 and 6) further substantiate this view. These calves excreted antibodies in their faeces up to 6 days after birth. The presence of these antibodies in the intestine most likely prevented the normal multiplication of the vaccine rotavirus. It appears from studies of transmissible gastroenteritis virus infections in swine that an intestinal immune response to a virus infection requires an extensive infection of the intestinal mucosa (Bohl and Saif, 1975) . Together, this probably explains why no intestinal antibody response was observed after vaccination of group D calves (Fig. 6 ), comparable to that in group B calves (Fig. 4) . However, a suppressing effect of serum antibodies on the mucosal antibody response cannot be excluded. This effect is suggested by the delayed and weak IgM-response after challenge of group C and D calves, which at that moment did not excrete detectable quantities of IgG rotavirus antibodies in their faeces. In some calves, the intestinal response was even absent. The observations with group C and D calves also confirm that feeding of colostral antibody for only a few days does not provide protection against challenge infection several days later. This requires continuous uptake of rotavirus antibodies (Bridget and Woode, 1975; Lecce et al., 1976; Snodgrass and Wells, 1978b) .",

This response is absent or diminished in calves with passively acquired specific antibodies in serum and intestine. Oral vaccination with modified live rotavirus of calves fed colostrum with rotavirus antibodies did not induce a protective intestinal immune response. This is most likely explained by neutralization of the vaccine virus as suggested by De Leeuw and Tiessink (1984) . In addition or alternatively, serum antibodies might suppress the development of intestinal immunity. Although oral vaccination rapidly induced a protective intestinal immune response in calves which were not fed colostral rotavirus antibodies, it is not sensible to omit or delay colostrum feeding. Therefore, alternative vaccination methods are needed to induce an active intestinal immune response or a persistent secretion of rotavirus antibodies in milk. To facilitate this, further study of the mucosal immune system of young and adult cattle is necessary.",

This possibility and the existence of mucosal memory in calves are subject of further study.The absence of IgG 1 and lgG 2 rotavirus antibodies in faeces (except for a few days after ingestion of colostrum containing rotavirus antibodies) is striking in view of the observations ofNewby and Bourne (1976). These authors reported lgG 1 to be the predominant isotype in the intestinal content of calves. This isotype appeared to be partly serum-derived. Consequently, [gQ1 rotavirus antibodies would be expected to be present in the faeces after infection. It is conceivable that lgG 1 or lgG 2 rotavirus antibodies secreted in the intestinal lumen are degraded by proteolytic enzymes during passage through the gut. However, incubation of purified IgG 1 containing rotavirus antibody activity with fresh faeces for 24 hr at 37oc did not reduce the IgG1 rotavirus antibody titre. Therefore~ no indication was obtained that the absence of lgG 1 rotavirus antibodies in faeces is due to proteolytic degradation, but the possibility that antibodies were degraded during passage in the intestinal tract is not excluded, it should also be noted that differences in sensitivity of the tests (which are difficult to assess) might influence the relative importance of lg-isotypes. For instance, a low relative sensitivity of the lgQI-IDAS might explain the absence of lgQ 1 rotavirus antibody activity in faeces. (The detection of lgG rotavirus antibodies in faeces after the ingestion of \"positive\" colostrum can be explained by the large amount of antibody administered).",
