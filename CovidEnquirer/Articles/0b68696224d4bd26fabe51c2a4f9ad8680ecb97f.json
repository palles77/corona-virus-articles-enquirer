To many it may appear that cultural differences do play a role in travel decision making between Asian and Western tourists. However, it is vital to provide empirical evidence of the impact of cultural differences in beliefs through a case study of the tsunami-hit destinations. Thus, this study aims to examine tourist barriers associated with tsunami-hit destinations, and also to assess cultural differences regarding such beliefs between Asians tourists from China and Thailand and Western tourists from Britain, Germany, and the United States and also across demographic profile. Keywords: destination recovery, travel barrier, Thai culture, cross culture, Thai and Chinese tourists and Thai tourism. \u00d3",

This is because a crisis creates a ripple effect to non-affected destinations causing them to also be perceived as risky (Cavlek, 2002) . Hence, it is suggested that tourism bureaus must dissociate an unaffected destination from a problematic destination (Mansfeld, 2006) by promoting safer alternative destinations (Pizam, 2002) .",

Many Chinese tourists cancelled their new year's trips to those places not only due to these sites being under reconstruction but partly because of the association of ghosts and bad luck with them (Thai Press Reports., 2005) . According to Rittichainuwat (2006) , many inbound Chinese and Thai tourists substituted their original travel itineraries to tsunami-affected areas with trips to other beach resorts due to perceived risks affiliated with ghosts and uncomfortable feelings about enjoying themselves at a resort where a lot of people had been killed, because the place was thought to be too sorrowful and inappropriate to celebrate the Chinese New Year. In contrast, it is almost a given that Westerners would not consider the issue of ghosts important in deciding whether to visit such places. In fact, the natural beauty and relaxing atmosphere of the tsunami-hit beaches, which some Asian tourists avoid for fear of ghosts, have motivated Scandinavian tourists (Rittichainuwat, 2008) .",

Durocher (1994) notes that destination recovery depends on the efficiency of tourism partners in bringing their facilities back to a predisaster level, and an effective marketing message that clearly communicates that the destination is once again open and ready for business. However, misinformation is one of the biggest obstacles to destination recovery (Beirman, 2006; Henderson, 1999; Tarlow, 2006) . Specifically, an image of a destination still in the process of recovery and under reconstruction persists when some hotels continue to remain closed, either due to physical damage, insurance claims, change of ownership, or the renegotiation of land leases (Durocher, 1994) .",

Since media coverage of catastrophes increases ratings and circulation, news organizations may use the crisis to respond to the demands of their audience (Milo & Yoder, 1991) . Due to geographic distance, non-tourists and potential inbound tourists rely on media coverage as their information source to keep them aware of occurrences in distance places and to evaluate perceived risks associated with destinations (Castelltort & M\u00e4der., in press ). The larger the viewer audience of local television stations and the larger the media circulation of newspapers, the greater possibility of negative news affecting potential consumers (Castelltort, in press ). Such news frightens away potential tourists who do not thoroughly evaluate the validity of the message and this can delay the speed of destination recovery (Henderson, 2005; Huang & Min, 2002; Mansfeld, 2006; Milo & Yoder, 1991) .",

Positive media coverage of special events can counter balance the negative news and enhance a positive image of the destination and its recovery (Ahmed, 1991; Castelltort, in press ). To eliminate the image of ''under-construction'', it is also necessary to make certain that the information given by operators matches the actual recovery reality (Durocher, 1994) . The best way to eliminate the image of a destination still under construction is by bringing travel agencies, meeting planners, and news reporters to a destination to witness for themselves the extent of the recovery and thus help overcome reluctance to book business (Durocher, 1994; Henderson, 2007) . Moreover, opinion leaders play a key role in minimizing perceived risks at a destination (Milo & Yoder, 1991) . Lacking information from a more credible source, the mass media, for one, may fulfill the role of opinion leader (Milo & Yoder, 1991) .",

While spirit is also defined as a disembodied soul thought of as separate from the body; ghost refers to the spirit of a dead person appearing to somebody still living (Oxford dictionary, 1988) . In the Thai context, spirit is more often used than ghost to refer to the soul of a deceased person (Cohen, 1990 (Cohen, , 1991 Komin, 1991; Tambiah, 1970 Tambiah, , 1984 Terwiel, 1994) .

In Thai culture, a ghost is pictured as an after-death, human phenomena with differing dominant characteristics, ranging from benevolence, with prestige given by the living and with responsible power, such as ancestors and guardian ghosts, to malevolence, of notoriety and caprice, which are either free-floating, localized ghosts in the world of human beings or those condemned to hell (Crowder, 2003; Tambiah, 1970) . This study defines ghosts as disembodied and restless spirits of deceased individuals that cannot be touched, nor can they physically touch the living because they are incorporeal and do not have a material form (Jacobi, 2003) .",

Such beliefs have taken root based on animism, Buddhism, Hinduism and Taoism, which teaches that souls of the dead are capable of existing after the death and dissolution of the body (Cano & Mysyk, 2004; Freed & Freed, 1990; Kaneko, 1990) .",

Likewise, Chinese children are taught to avoid proximity to dead bodies as they are believed to bring bad luck (Chan & Lai Cecilla., 2009) . The fear of ghosts is instilled in children very early and continues into adult life. Though such beliefs among young people today and the educated may be weakening, on the whole they remain strong and influential (Chan & Lai, 2009 ), as education does not necessarily eradicate culturally-held beliefs in ghosts (Burnard, Naiyapatana, & Lloyd 2006; Lindeman & Aarnio 2007) . For example, Komin (1991) finds that even Thai scientists admit that they believe in the existence of certain kinds of ghosts.",

Thus, it is not surprising that the tsunami-hit destinations are perceived as ghost-haunted destinations, and thus suffer from a decrease in the number of tourists. According to Thai and Chinese beliefs, restless ghosts can cause misfortune to the living, such as illness (fever, choking or difficulty breathing) and possession (mental disorder) (Burnard et al., 2006; Cohen, 1990 Cohen, , 1991 Freed & Freed, 1990) . Also, possession in the form of sickness diagnosed as ghost malaise is often found in those who have visited haunted places (Comaroff, 2007) . Hence, an uninhabited place is carefully avoided, especially if there is a suspected high concentration of restless ghosts constituting a threat to the living (Formoso, 2001) .",

English and American sailors in the 15th and 16th century believed that people who had died violently and/or in an accident and had not received proper burial, were not able to rest peacefully and so became restless ghosts who returned to trouble the living at sea, which is perceived as a threshold from which the dead can sometimes return (Stewart, 2005) . Since the sea allows the horizontal movement of ghosts across its surface, the permeable nature of water makes the sea conducive to vertical connections between the upper-world on the surface and the underworld in the depths; thus, the sea is perceived as a threshold rather than a barrier that links the living and the dead (Stewart, 2005) . Moreover, a ''watery grave'' does not allow for the comforting solidity offered by the earth (Stewart, 2005) .",

Because of these influences, a belief in ghosts is considered irrational (Jones, 2005) , deviant and dangerous, as superstitious people rely on unsubstantiated external forces rather than on their own actions (National Science Foundation., 2000) . This weakening of beliefs is also the result of the process of secularization in the modern Western world, where a smaller percentage of the population has maintained its traditional Christian beliefs (Sj\u00f6din, 1995) . A modern scientific outlook on the world, especially from the perspective of materialistic naturalism in the sciences with its emphasis on proven validity, gives a better understanding of the cause-effect relationships that explain our world, which in turn make superstition (such as belief in ghosts) an obstacle to understanding reality and gaining knowledge of ourselves and the world (Sj\u00f6din, 1995) . Consequently, superstition no longer has a strong foothold on the norms of a Western culture that values rational science (Reisinger, 2003) .",

In the first stage, items in the questionnaire were derived from in-depth interviews with a purposive sample of one German news reporter, one Thai travel writer and one general manager of a Chinese inbound tour company at a press conference, as well as eight tourists (one German, one Belgian, two Mainland Chinese, and four Thais) who survived the 2004 tsunami. The interviewees were asked, with an open-end question, to identify travel barriers which would deter them and the people they knew from visiting the tsunami-affected beach resorts. The researcher recorded the responses from the interviews and selected the most frequent key words and used them to develop the questionnaire items. The items in the questionnaire were also the results of the content analysis of news reports about the 2004 tsunami on Thai tourism. The interviews and content analysis resulted in 14 travel barrier attributes which are listed in Table 2 .",

As for marital status, slightly more than half of the respondents (58%) were single, followed by 35% of married couples. In education, most tourists were highly educated, with 85% having college or graduate degrees, followed by 11% with secondary or high school diplomas. Regarding occupation, more than a quarter were sales and office workers (37%), followed by students (19%), entrepreneurs and managers (16%), government officers (8%), housewives and retirees (6%), and teachers (5%). More than half were Thai residents (68%), whereas major inbound tourists came from the United Kingdom (11%), China (10%), the United States (6%), and Germany (5%). When asked whether the respondents had plans to visit tsunami-affected beach resorts after the disaster, about 38% were undecided, 37% said they had plans to do so, and 25% had no plans to visit such resorts.

Unlike the report by the National Science Foundation (2000), this study supports the study by Freed and Freed (1990) , which found that beliefs in ghosts can be found in both genders and in a range of ages. This result also supports previous studies indicating that education does not necessarily cause belief in ghosts to disappear (Burnard et al., 2006; Lindeman & Aarnio, 2007) . Particularly, education has not necessarily affected cultural beliefs in ghosts among the Thais, who have acquired such beliefs from childhood (Burnard et al., 2006; Komin, 1991; Terwiel, 1994 ). Yet, there is a significant difference on such beliefs across country of residence at the multivariate level on all dimensions of travel barriers considered together (Wilk's Lambda = 0.75, F = 7.6, p-value < 0.01).

Likewise, informal conversations with Thai and Chinese tourists who participated in the survey revealed that people who hold such beliefs tend to avoid traveling, especially during the New Year's holidays, to places where someone has been killed, due to the belief that ghosts and bad luck would haunt them throughout the New Year.

Many people from Thai and Chinese cultures, have a strong belief in ghosts and so perceived the tsunamihit destinations as haunted by ghosts during the early stages of destination recovery. Moreover, news reports on ghost stories strengthen the perceived risks of ghosts at the tsunami-hit destinations. Hence, once a 'ghost story' becomes widely known, it dissuades people from visiting such places (Comaroff, 2007) . Ghost stories surrounding the tsunamihit destinations may be the community's mechanism for coping with the traumatic effects of a natural disaster. As Cashman and Cronin (2008) stated, individuals tend to explain the phenomena by integrating it with supernatural beliefs to make sense of the disaster. Moreover, news attention to catastrophes and negative stories make ghost stories hot discussion issues for both news reports and for rumor (Milo & Yoder, 1991) . Although in the modern world belief in ghosts is gradually vanishing, it has not completely disappeared. It still serves as a mean to manage individuals' anxiety and stress caused by uncertainty (Hofstede, 1980; Hofstede, 2001; Kim, 1999; Reisinger & Mavondo, 2005; Sch\u00fc tte & Ciarlante, 1998) .",

While American and British people separate the physical and the spiritual world and believe in a reality that can be objectively tested, instead of accepting unproven superstitious ''evidence,'' (Reisinger, 2003) , the Chinese and Thai live in cultures where most people hold strong beliefs in ghosts, which conform to collective norms (Formoso, 2001; Komin, 1991; Summala, 1996; Tambiah, 1970 Tambiah, , 1984 Terwiel 1994; Yang et al., 2008) . Such beliefs continue to be strongly held in Chinese and Thai cultures even in modern times. More importantly, beliefs in ghosts are not only individually held but also socially shared.",

As Reisinger (2003) and Reisinger and Turner (2002) note, Western cultures are future time oriented while Asian cultures are past oriented. Hence, when Asian tourists visit with the assumption that the destination is safe, service providers should not cause them worry by informing their guests about a past tragedy at the site (Tarlow & Santana, 2002) . This is because Asian tourists tend to be sensitive to negative messages, which might be exaggerated and lead to negative repercussions (Kim & Wong, 2006) . Furthermore, while the Asian (Thai and Chinese) tourists are concerned about both physical and psychological safety, most Western (American, British, and German) tourists pay more attention to the physical recovery. Hence, Western tourists should be the primary target markets of the destinations that suffer from ghost panic by Asian tourists. Once the destinations are crowded with Western tourists, it will be perceived as physically and psychologically safe for Chinese and Thai tourists to visit those places. Nevertheless, an efficient warning system must be installed at the destinations to ensure physical safety, which is the major concern of both Western and Asian tourists (Rittichainuwat, 2008) .",

Moreover, newsletters on religious ceremonies to dispel ghosts at the disaster-hit destinations should not be treated as irrational. Furthermore, in the aftermath of a disaster, such messages should be released frequently with a focus on Chinese and Thai markets during the early destination recovery period. However, rather than calling such ceremonies 'dispelling ghost ceremonies,' they should be called 'auspicious ceremonies' to highlight the positive aspect of the place and eliminate the negative word ''ghost''. It can be seen that, the fear of ghosts at a particular destination can result in a short-term ''ghost panic'' impact on the recovering destination. However, once the destination has become crowded, such fear disappears, especially if tragedy does not repeat itself at the same place, as confirmed by Beirman (2006) , Pizam (2002) , Mansfeld (1999 Mansfeld ( , 2006 and Tarlow (2006) .",

Hence, promotional messages should highlight the recovery progress that has been made at the destinations. During the early stage of destination recovery, the beauty of nature can be used to motivate tourists in visiting the tsunami hit-destinations by highlighting the quality of the sea water, the beaches, and the improvements in landscape and infrastructure (Henderson, 2005; Ichinosawa, 2006; Rittichainuwat 2006; Rittichainuwat 2008 ). In addition, since tourist-generating tour operators would not promote a destination unless it is safe due to liability for their customer safety (Cavlek, 2002; Wilks & Page, 2003) , destination marketers must boost safety confidence not only with potential tourists but also with tour operators.",

Moreover, travel writers (who tend to report positive news about destinations) and international news reporters, whose reports are often on catastrophes (Castelltort, in press) , should be invited to join familiarization trips to witness destination recovery.

Thus, destination recovery requires more than physical recovery. It also requires psychological recovery, which has lagged behind and has slowed down destination recovery. Nevertheless, 'ghost panic' is a short-term effect. Once a destination becomes crowded, it is no longer perceived as haunted by ghosts. However, for people who hold strong beliefs in ghosts or have experienced trauma, the destination continues to be a place of mourning unless all corpses are discovered and properly buried, and appropriate religion ceremonies have been held.",

When strong beliefs in ghosts become a major travel barrier, local authorities and service providers must ask for media assistance to discourage reports of ghosts in order to assist the local people in recovering from the consequences of 'ghost panic'. Furthermore, the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami called for governments of host destinations to find a counterbalance between tourism income and tourist safety (Kivela, 2006; Plog, 2006) . Specially, there is a demand for safety measures such as tsunami warning systems at the tsunami-hit tourist destinations (Rittichainuwat, 2006) , which is regarded as one component of a crisis management system to establish confidence and prevent tragedy.",

While previous destination recovery studies suggest destination marketers communicate the extent of the physical recovery, this study suggests that such efforts should be made simultaneously with messages confirming that the destination is also psychologically safe. In other words, while most marketing efforts during destination recovery deliver messages about physical recovery of infrastructure and hotels and offer incentives to stimulate tourist arrivals, they fail to create confidence that would ensure the psychologically safety of the destinations. Destination marketers can not deny the fact that psychologically perceived risk regarding ghosts is another real factor that delays destination recovery. More importantly, the travel barriers revolving around collective beliefs takes more time to overcome than physical risks from wreckage and debris. Thus, although significant discounts might interest those who do not believe in ghosts, it would not attract those who do.",

Because of this, it can take time to elicit from some respondents their beliefs in ghosts. To illustrate, some respondents initially answered that they did not believe in ghost, but the content of their responses indicated that they were not certain. Similar responses were found among Northern Hindu Indian respondents in a study by Freed and Freed (1990) and a study by Burnard et al. (2006) , where some respondents give indirect responses to questions about beliefs in ghosts: denying the beliefs at the beginning but then acknowledging such beliefs. As Bloom, Venard, Harden, and Seetharaman (2007) and Peltzer and Renner (2003) note, although superstition has continued to be a topic of interest for researchers for nearly 60 years, it is difficult to capture actual attitudes due to participants' tendency to answer in a socially desirable way that may, in fact, appear to contradict their superstitious beliefs.",
