Pre-set concentrations were used according to the volumes of the rooms and garages. Three cycles were performed with increasing contact times. Repetitive experiments were performed using Bacillus atrophaeus (formerly Bacillus subtilis) Raven 1162282 spores to control the effect of decontamination; after a sampling plan, spore strips were placed in various positions in rooms, ambulances, and inside and outside the items of medical equipment. Decontamination was effective in 87% of 146 spore tests in closed test rooms and in 100% of 48 tests in a surgical department when using three cycles. One or two cycles had no effect. The sporicidal effect on internal parts of the medical equipment was only 62.3% (220 tests). When the devices were run and ventilated during decontamination, 100% (57/57) of spore strips placed inside were decontaminated. In the ambulances, the penetration of H 2 O 2 into equipment, devices, glove boxes, under mattresses, and the drivers' cabins was 100% (60/60 tests) when using three cycles, but was less effective when using one or two cycles. In conclusion, an H 2 O 2 dry fumigation system, run in three cycles, seemed to have a good sporicidal effect when used in rooms, ambulances, and external and internal parts of ventilated equipment. Further studies need to be performed concerning concentration, contact",

Chemicals such as chlorine and 5% chloramine have traditionally been used in Norway for surface disinfection during the terminal decontamination of isolation rooms and furniture after discharge of patients with infections. [1] [2] [3] [4] The same procedure has been used for ambulances and for medical and other equipment after use by infectious patients. [2] [3] [4] Manual chemical disinfection is both time and labour consuming, and there may be difficulties to ensure coverage. Internal parts of medical equipment such as ventilators, continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) and other respiratory tract equipment, infusion pumps, suction equipment, etc. may be difficult to decontaminate. Most medical equipment has an air-cooled motor that takes air from the patient's room/environment, enabling internal parts to become contaminated.",

The whole disinfection process, including the number of cycles (diffusion time) and the contact time, was pre-set on the robot. One or more pre-set cycles of H 2 O 2 gas used varying diffusion times according to the volume of the room. Each cycle was followed by an increasing contact time of 30, 60 and 120 min after one, two and three cycles, respectively. Each cycle was immediately followed by the pre-set contact time, which was then immediately followed by the next cycle, etc. The test rooms (including garages for ambulances) were closed throughout the decontamination process, and no people were present. All ventilation openings in the rooms were taped over. The concentration of H 2 O 2 was 2-17.4 parts per million (ppm) in the rooms and 36-60 ppm in the garages during the diffusion time. The Norwegian Directory of Labour Inspection has set exposure limits of 1 ppm of H 2 O 2 for 8 h of exposure and less than 3 ppm for 15 min four times a day. The fume does not persist because of rapid decomposition. When the disinfection procedure was complete, the room or equipment could be used immediately.",

After the intentional release of Bacillus anthracis in Autumn 2001 in the USA, there was a need for published materials about inactivating bacillus spores. A survey of the literature showed that boiling water for O10 min can reduce B. anthracis spores by at least 10 6 , that sodium hypochlorite is sporicidal (depending on the concentration of free available chlorine and pH), and that gaseous 'sterilization' of residual spores is dependent on gas type, concentration, humidity, temperature and carrier material. 5 Many vapours used for decontamination are not easily eliminated by brief aeration. They may be toxic or bind to (and change) the materials in technical equipment and devices. In addition, the presence of organic material may reduce the effectiveness of most chemical disinfectants. 5, 6 'Decontamination' is the irreversible inactivation of most, but not all, infectious agents, while 'sterilization' is the destruction of all microbial viability, including spores (probability of one living microbe present is less than 10 K6 ). Chemical liquids and vapours are mainly used as decontaminating agents. 1, 2, [5] [6] [7] Some chemicals, such as H 2 O 2 gas plasma, may kill all micro-organisms including spores after prolonged exposure times (6-10 h) and are called 'chemical sterilants'. 6 H 2 O 2 in liquid form (3-6%) is an effective disinfectant for most microbes, and a concentration of 6% or higher even has an effect on Cryptosporidium parvum with a contact time of 20 min. 7 H 2 O 2 liquid (0.88 mol/L) has been found to kill 100% of Bacillus subtilis spores after 3 and 6 h. 8 H 2 O 2 pulsed plasma (0.208 mg/L) has been reported to kill 100% of 3.4!10 5 B. subtilis subsp. globgii spores on paper disks after 15 min. 9 H 2 O 2 probably exerts its effect by producing destructive hydroxylfree radicals that may attack lipid membranes, DNA and other cell components. These radicals may affect the spore core, oxidize thiol groups in proteins and enzymes of viruses and bacteria, and act on ribosomes in fungi. 10 At a high concentration, H 2 O 2 liquid will corrode metals such as copper, zinc and brass. [5] [6] [7] Vapour-phase H 2 O 2 technology sterilization is, however, a promising alternative to more toxic and potentially environmentally hazardous methods of sterilization of heat-labile materials.",

            "text": "The use of H 2 O 2 vapour may be an effective way to decontaminate critical enclosed areas, such as isolation units, clean rooms, technical equipment and devices, and general areas contaminated with pathogens. Recently, French et al. 11 showed that an H 2 O 2 vapour decontamination system, using a gas generator that evaporates 30% liquid H 2 O 2 via a distribution system with high kinetic energy and even distribution throughout the room, was highly effective in eradicating environmental methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Before decontamination, 72% of room swabs yielded MRSA; afterwards, only one of 85 samples (1.2%) yielded MRSA. The decontamination cycles lasted for 5 h in total and gave a concentration of 500 ppm for 40 min. 11 In the present study, we used an H 2 O 2 dry gas system programmed to a pre-set concentration of 12-60 ppm per treatment cycle, dependent on the volume of the rooms and garages. One to three cycles were used for repetitive experiments, followed by increasing contact times of 30, 60 and 120 min, respectively; i.e. a total of 4-5 h. Medical equipment and devices, and an ambulance containing medical equipment were placed in test rooms and garages, respectively. Repetitive experiments were performed using B. atrophaeus (former subtilis) spores (Raven Biological, Nebraska, USA) to control the effect of decontamination. Spore strips were placed in various places in the rooms, ambulances, and inside and outside the pieces of medical equipment. Decontamination was effective in 87% of 146 tests in special test rooms, and in 100% of 48 tests in rooms in a surgical department, using three decontamination cycles. One or two cycles had no effect on any of the spore tests (18/18). The sporicidal effect on internal parts of the medical equipment was lower; approximately 62% of all 220 tests. However, when the medical device was run and ventilated during the disinfection period, all of the spore tests (57/57) from inside the devices were decontaminated. In ambulances, the penetration of H 2 O 2 into equipment, devices and the driver's cabin was 100% effective (60/60 tests) when using three cycles of decontamination.",
