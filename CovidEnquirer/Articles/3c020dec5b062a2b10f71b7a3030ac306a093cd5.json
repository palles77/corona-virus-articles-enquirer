Histologic lesions included acute diffuse, severe atrophic jejunitis (Figure 2 , panel B) and mild vacuolation of superficial epithelial cells and subepithelial edema in cecum and colon ( Figure  2 , panel C). These findings were similar to those in conventional pigs naturally infected with Asian or US strains of PEDV and in caesarean-derived, colostrum-deprived pigs experimentally infected with CV777 (2,3,5,6). The mean jejunal VH:CD of the 5 infected pigs ranged from 1.2 to 3.4, probably depending on the stage of infection (Table 1) , and that of the negative control pig was 6.3 (\u00b10.2).

A) Intestine of pig 1 at postinoculation hour (PIH) 30 (4-5 h after onset of clinical signs), showing thin and transparent intestinal walls (duodenum to colon) and extended stomach filled with curdled milk. B) Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained jejunum of pig 3 at PIH 46 (at onset of clinical signs), showing acute diffuse, severe atrophic jejunitis. Original magnification \u00d7200. C) H&E-stained cecum of noninoculated pig 4 (which was exposed to inoculated pig 3 at PIH 0) at 120 h after onset of clinical signs. Acute diffuse, mild vacuolation of superficial epithelial cells (arrows) and subepithelial edema are seen. Original magnification \u00d7200. D) Immunofluorescence staining of jejunum of pig 5 at PIH 67 (37-41 h after onset of clinical signs), indicating that the epithelial cells lining atrophied villi are positive for PEDV. Original magnification \u00d7200. E) Immunofluorescence staining of jejunum of pig 3 at PIH 46 (at onset of clinical signs), showing localization of PEDV antigens in the cytoplasm of enterocytes. Original magnification \u00d7600. F) Immunofluorescence staining of colon of pig 2 at PIH 72 (26-28 h after onset of clinical signs), showing large numbers of PEDV-positive cells. Original magnification \u00d7200. CCL, crypt cell layer. Nuclei were stained with blue-fluorescent 4\u2032, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride.",
