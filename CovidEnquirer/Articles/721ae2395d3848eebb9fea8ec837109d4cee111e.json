The human lung contains up to 40 different cell types including epithelial, endothelial, mesenchymal and smooth muscle cells 30 and it is an important natural site of infection 9, 26, [31] [32] [33] [34] . We implanted human lung tissue subcutaneously into the back of immunodeficient mice to create humanized lung-only mice (LoM). The human lung tissue vascularizes, expands and persists as a human lung implant, and supports replication of viral and bacterial human pathogens in vivo. When incorporated into BLT mice (BLT-L mice), lung implants are repopulated with autologous human innate and adaptive immune cells. Direct inoculation of BLT-L human lung implants with HCMV induces HCMV-specific human IgM, IgG and T cell responses that can effectively control infection in vivo. LoM and BLT-L mice expand the susceptibility of humanized mice to a broad range of human pathogens. These new models can be used to study pathogen replication, pathogenesis, immune reactivity and human therapies.",

We injected cell-free HCMV TB40/E, a clinical HCMV strain, into the human lung implants of LoM. HCMV-DNA was detected in the lung implants of LoM as early as 4 days post inoculation (mean: 4.70\u00d710 3 \u00b1 2.54\u00d710 3 s.e.m. HCMV-DNA copies/10 5 cells, range: 2.94\u00d710 2 -1.19\u00d710 4 HCMV-DNA copies/10 5 cells) (Fig. 2k ). HCMV immediate early (IE), early (E) and late (L) proteins were detected in lung implants at 14 and 52 days postinoculation indicating that HCMV infection was maintained over time (Fig. 2l) . The expression of IE proteins is consistent with lytic HCMV replication in this model as observed during human primary infection and reactivation 42 . In vivo, HCMV antigen was observed in human mesenchymal cells (Fig. 2m) . We determined the effect of pre-exposure prophylaxis with ganciclovir (GCV) on HCMV replication in LoM. GCV was administered once daily two days prior to and 14 days after inoculation of HCMV TB40/E expressing luciferase (Fig. 2n) . HCMV replication was monitored over time by measuring luciferase activity. By four days post-exposure, HCMV levels were ~66% lower in the human lung implants of GCV-treated LoMs (mean: 3.36\u00d710 5 \u00b1 1.61 \u00d710 5 s.e.m. radiance) compared to untreated controls (mean: 1.00\u00d710 6 \u00b1 2.90 \u00d710 5 s.e.m. radiance) (Fig. 2n ). HCMV levels continued to decline over time in GCV-treated LoM. At the end of the GCV treatment course (14 days post HCMV exposure), HCMV levels were ~2 logs lower in the lung implants of GCV-treated LoM (mean: 1.48\u00d710 5 \u00b1 4.96 \u00d710 4 s.e.m. radiance) compared to untreated LoMs (mean: 8.99\u00d710 6 \u00b1 5.02 \u00d710 6 s.e.m. radiance) (Fig. 2n) . Suprisingly, after GCV treatment was discontinued, HCMV levels continued to decline. By 25 days post HCMVexposure (11 days after the last GCV dose), HCMV levels in the lung implants of GCVtreated LoM were further reduced by ~40% (mean: 9.25\u00d710 4 \u00b1 2.65 \u00d710 4 s.e.m. radiance) and significantly lower than untreated controls (mean: 3.27\u00d710 7 \u00b1 1.69 \u00d710 7 s.e.m. radiance) (Fig. 2n) . Together, these results demonstrate the ability of LoM to sustain replication of several clinically relevant human pathogens and to serve as a platform for the in vivo testing of existing and novel antimicrobials.",

In immune suppressed individuals such as transplant and AIDS patients, HCMV can reactivate resulting in uncontrolled lytic replication causing a multi-organ CMV syndrome 43 . Therefore, novel antivirals are needed that can inhibit HCMV lytic replication in vivo to ameliorate clinical symptoms of CMV disease. Since natural infections are typically asymptomatic and undiagnosed, the profile of HCMV genes expressed during lytic replication in vivo has not been determined on a genome-wide scale due to the difficulty of obtaining acutely infected samples. To define the complement of HCMV genes expressed in human tissue in vivo, we injected cell-free HCMV TB40/E into the human lung implants of LoM. HCMV (ds)cDNA was enriched with biotinylated probes spanning both strands of the entire HCMV genome and next generation sequencing used to measure viral gene expression. Using this novel approach, we were able to measure, for the first time, the complement of viral genes expressed in vivo in human tissue during lytic replication. Results revealed widespread HCMV gene expression spanning the viral genome, consistent with robust lytic replication ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ). Expression of known lytic genes encoding IE proteins IE1 (UL123) and IE2 (UL122), early proteins (UL44 and UL38), and late proteins pp65 (UL83) and pp71 (UL82) were detected. By contrast, expression of UL138, a well-characterized latency gene, was not observed. These results serve as proof-of-principle of the utility of LoM to investigate key aspects of HCMV replication in human lung tissue in vivo.",

            "text": "In addition to human epithelial, endothelial and mesenchymal cells (Fig. 3c) , human lung implants of BLT-L mice contained human innate and adaptive immune cells (Fig. 3d) . Ex vivo stimulation of these cells with PMA/ionomycin or LPS demonstrated their broad capacity for human cytokine (pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory) and chemokine production (Supplementary Table 2 ). The human hematopoietic cells present in the human lung implants of BLT-L mice (hCD45 + , mean: 72.5% \u00b1 5.5% s.e.m., range: 27.4-90.4%) included human myeloid cells (hCD33 + , mean: 15.2% \u00b1 3.0% s.e.m., range: 0.5-42.8%), B cells (hCD19 + , mean: 7.5% \u00b1 1.7% s.e.m., range: 0.4-22.2%) and T cells (hCD3 + , mean: 63.4% \u00b1 4.6% s.e.m., range: 26.9-92.3%) (Fig. 3e ). No significant difference in human myeloid cell, B cell or T cell levels was observed between the human lung implants and mouse lung of BLT-L mice ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ). CD4 + and CD8 + human T cells were present in the human lung implants of BLT-L mice. Human CD4 + T cell levels were significantly lower (p=6.472e-7) and CD8 + T cell levels were significantly higher (p=0.0004) in the human lung implants of BLT-L mice compared to the mouse lung. The CD4:CD8 T cell ratio (mean: 2.2 \u00b1 0.17 s.e.m., range: 0.93-3.42) in human lung implants ( Fig. 3e ) was similar to that observed in humans 44 . No difference in T cell activation was observed ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Memory (CD45RO + ) CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were present in the human lung implants of BLT-L mice, the majority of which expressed an effector memory phenotype (CCR7-negative) (CD4 + T cells, mean: 87.2% \u00b1 1.97% s.e.m., range: 81.8-90.8% and CD8 + T cells, mean: 97.1% \u00b1 0.44% s.e.m., range: 96.1-97.9%) ( Supplementary Fig. 7a,b) . We also identified the presence of CD4 + (mean: 25.4% \u00b1 3.58% s.e.m., range: 18.5-35.5% of memory CD4 + T cells) and CD8 + (mean: 38.5% \u00b1 7.11% s.e.m., range: 21.0-51.8% of memory CD8 + T cells) tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM, CD45RO + CD69 + ) in the human lung implants of BLT-L mice as observed in humans ( Supplementary Fig. 7c ,d) 44 . Like BLT mice, in addition to the human lung implant, human hematopoietic cells were systemically distributed throughout the animals including primary and secondary immune tissues (bone marrow, human thymic implant, spleen and lymph nodes), effector sites and mucosal tissues (lung, liver, gastrointestinal [GI] tract and female reproductive tract [FRT]) of BLT-L mice (Fig. 3f ). Innate and adaptive human immune cells were present in all tissues analyzed ( Supplementary Fig. 7e ).",

HCMV replication was detectable in the human lung implants of LoM and BLT-L mice at 4 days post-inoculation (Fig. 4a ). In LoM, robust HCMV replication was maintained up to 5 weeks post-inoculation (last time point analyzed) (Fig. 4a ). In contrast, in BLT-L mice virus replication began to decline by 11 days post-inoculation (Fig. 4a) . Luciferase activity in BLT-L mice was significantly lower compared to LoM (Fig. 4a) . HCMV replication in BLT-L mice continued to decline over time (Fig. 4a) . Specifically, luciferase activity in the human lung implants of BLT-L mice at week 4 (mean: 5.10\u00d710 4 \u00b1 2.25\u00d710 4 s.e.m. radiance, range: 2.68-8.4\u00d710 4 radiance) and week 5 (mean: 6.46\u00d710 4 \u00b1 8.08\u00d710 3 s.e.m. radiance, range: 5.5-7.47\u00d710 4 radiance) post-inoculation approached baseline levels (mean: 2.34\u00d710 4 radiance) and was significantly lower compared to LoM (Fig. 4a ).

However, following repeated HCMV exposure, IE1specific CD4 + T cell cytokine responses were detected in the human lung implant and liver of BLT-L mice, suggesting repeated antigen exposure induced or augmented antigen-specific CD4 + T cell responses (Fig. 5c ). IE1-specific CD8 + T cell responses measured by ICS were detected more frequently in repeatedly HCMV exposed mice than in singly exposed BLT-L mice (Fischer's exact, two-tailed p=0.039) (Fig. 5d ,e and Supplementary Tables 4, 7 and 8). Repeated HCMV exposure also induced stronger HCMV-specific CD8 + T cell responses across tissues (Fig. 5d-f and Fig. 4h ), producing T cell responses consistent with those reported in chronic human HCMV infection [51] [52] [53] [54] . Increases in pentamer reactivity were also observed. Classically restricted HCMV-specific CD8 + T cells in repeat exposure BLT-L mice approached 2% of all CD8 + T cells (Fig. 5f ), between 4-15-fold greater than pentamer frequencies observed following a single exposure (Fig. 4c ,d and data not shown). Full details of immune reactivity following repeated HCMV inoculation are provided in Supplementary  Tables 7 and 8. Although BLT-L mice were exposed to multiple doses of TB40/E or AD169, HCMV-DNA was only detected in the human lung implants of 9/18 mice analyzed (2 TB40/E and 7 AD169 exposed BLT-L mice) (Supplementary Tables 9 and 10 ). HCMV-DNA was rarely detected in tissues other than the human lung implants (3/108 tissues analyzed) and was not detected in PB (Supplementary Tables 9 and 10) suggesting strong immune control of HCMV replication in vivo.",

The lung implants persist for at least 12 months post implantation (last time point analyzed). BLT-Lung (BLT-L) mice were constructed by implanting a sandwich of human fetal thymus-liver-thymus tissue (Advanced Bioscience Resources, Alameda CA) under the kidney capsule of irradiated (200 rads) 10-15 week old male and female NSG mice. Two pieces of autologous human lung tissue (~2-4 mm 3 ) was implanted subcutaneously into the right and left back. Following tissue implantation animals received a bone marrow transplant (via tail vein injection) of autologous liver-derived human CD34 + hematopoietic stem cells. The non-CD34 + cell fraction was used for 4-digit HLA typing at the HLA-A, B and C loci. Reconstitution of BLT-L mice with human hematopoeitic cells was monitored longitudinally by flow cytometry as previously described 13, 14, [62] [63] [64] .

Following antigen retrieval and blocking with 5% serum (corresponding to the secondary antibody's host species), 0.1% Triton x100, and 50% Rodent M block (Biocare Medical) in PBS, tissue sections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C. Tissue sections were then stained with fluorescent conjugated secondary antibodies followed by DAPI and then mounted. Primary antibodies were directed against human epithelial cells (cytokeratin 19), endothelial cells (CD34), mesenchymal cells (vimentin), hematopoietic cells (CD45), macrophages (CD68), dendritic cells (CD11c), natural killer (NK) cells/NK T cells (CD56), B cells (CD20), T cells (CD3), CD4 + cells (CD4), CD8 + cells (CD8) (Life Sciences Reporting Summary). Primary antibodies directed against mouse endothelial cells (mCD34), epithelial cells (mcytokeratin 19), and hematopoietic cells (mCD45) were used to distinguish the presence of mouse cells (Life Sciences Reporting Summary). Primary antibodies directed against HCMV glycoprotein B, immediate early (IE), early (E) and late (L) proteins were used to detect HCMV positive cells (Life Sciences Reporting Summary). Tissue sections were stained with an anti-ZIKV NS2B antibody to detect ZIKV infected cells. Small pieces of human lung implant tissue collected from MERS-CoV infected LoM were fixed in 10% formalin for >7 days at 4\u00b0C, embedded in paraffin, sectioned (5 \u00b5m) and stained with MERS-CoV nucleocapsid polyclonal antibody (Life Sciences Reporting Summary). Tissue sections were also stained with appropriate isotype negative control antibodies. Tissue sections for immunohistochemistry were imaged on a Nikon Eclipse Ci microscope using Nikon Elements BR software (version 4.30.01) with a Nikon Digital Sight DS-Fi2 camera and Brightness and contrast were adjusted on whole images in Adobe Photoshop (CS6). Tissue sections for immunofluorescence were imaged on an Olympus BX61 upright wide field microscope using Improvision's Velocity software (version X) with a Hammatuse ORCA RC camera. Brightness and contrast were adjusted on whole images using ImageJ software (version 1.51C). In Fig. 2b , d, h and m, pseudocoloring was used to depict MERS-CoV, ZIKV, RSV and HCMV antigen in green and human cell types in magenta. In Fig. 1i and j, Fig. 2i and Supplementary Fig. 1b , where red/green fluorescent images were originally captured the red fluorescent signal was digitally altered to improve visualization by colorblind readers by adjusting the red channel hue by \u221245 using Adobe Photoshop (CS6).",

The definition of center, and dispersion and precision measures is indicated in the figure legends and/or the Results. The exact value of n and what n stands for is in the figure legends and methods details. Statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism (version 6, 7 or 8) or R (version 3.4.4). No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. No randomization was used to determine how samples/animals were allocated to experimental groups or processed. Investigators were not blinded to group allocations or when assessing outcomes. For all statistical comparisons p values <0.05 were considered significant. All statistical tests were exact. A two-tailed Mann-Whitney test was used to compare luciferase activity in the human lung implants of LoM and BLT-L mice (Fig. 4a) and human immune cell levels in the mouse lung and human lung organoids of BLT-L mice (Supplementary Fig.  6) . A two-tailed Fischer's exact test was used to compare the incidence of HCMV-specific human IgM, IgG and CD8 + T cells in BLT-L mice exposed to one or multiple doses of HCMV ( Fig. 4 and 5) . Human cytokine and chemokine levels pre and post HCMV inoculation were compared with a two-tailed Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test ( Supplementary Fig. 8 ).",
