            "text": "BACKGROUND: Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) is the main limitation to long-term survival after lung transplantation. Because effective therapies are lacking, early identification and mitigation of risk factors is a pragmatic approach to improve outcomes. Acute cellular rejection (ACR) is the most pervasive risk factor for CLAD, but diagnosis requires transbronchial biopsy, which carries risks. We hypothesized that gene expression in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell pellet (CP) could replace biopsy and inform on mechanisms of CLAD. METHODS: We performed RNA sequencing on BAL CPs from 219 lung transplant recipients with A-grade ACR (n = 61), lymphocytic bronchiolitis (n = 58), infection (n = 41), or no rejection/infection (n = 59). Differential gene expression was based on absolute fold difference >2.0 and Benjaminiadjusted p-value \u22640.05. We used the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery Bioinformatics Resource for pathway analyses. For classifier modeling, samples were randomly split into training (n = 154) and testing sets (n = 65). A logistic regression model using recursive feature elimination and 5-fold cross-validation was trained to optimize area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: Differential gene expression identified 72 genes. Enriched pathways included T-cell receptor signaling, natural killer cell\u2212mediated cytotoxicity, and cytokine\u2212cytokine receptor interaction. A 4-gene model (AUC = 0.72) and classification threshold defined in the training set exhibited fair performance in the testing set; accuracy was 76%, specificity 82%, and sensitivity 60%. In addition, classification as ACR was associated with worse CLAD-free survival (hazard ratio = 2.42; 95% confidence interval = 1.29\u22124.53).",

            "text": "Lung transplant remains a viable treatment option for select patients with advanced lung diseases, but long-term outcomes remain disappointing. The main limitation to better long-term survival is chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), which affects more than half of the lung recipients by 5 years post-transplant. 1 Currently, there are no proven effective treatments. Therefore, preventive strategies are key, including risk factor identification and mitigation. The principal risk factor for CLAD is acute rejection or, more precisely, A-grade acute cellular rejection (ACR), which is diagnosed by transbronchial biopsy (TBBX) exhibiting perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrates that can extend into the interstitium. 2 Although definitive data are lacking, it is widely accepted that treatment of A-grade ACR with augmented immune suppression is an important strategy for reducing the risk of CLAD. However, unnecessary treatment increases the risk of opportunistic infections and malignancy, which makes an accurate diagnosis important. Airway inflammation, also known as lymphocytic bronchiolitis (LB), is variably also termed B-grade ACR. 2 However, the frequent coexistence with airway infection, as well as reported refractoriness to corticosteroid treatment, 3 are sources of controversy for inclusion of LB as ACR.",

First, TBBX has been associated with a 4% incidence of pneumothorax and 3% incidence of major bleeding. 4 In lung transplant recipients specifically, the incidence of a major complication of bronchoscopy was 2.3%, with TBBX being the major risk factor. 5 Besides patient safety, TBBX is associated with a relatively high rate of sampling error. In a recent multicenter study, approximately 8% of TBBXs yielded an inadequate sample unable to be graded for A-grade ACR, and another 26% were assessed as sub-optimal (fewer than 5 pieces of well-expanded alveolated lung). 6 Even when alveolated tissue is obtained, affected areas may be missed by the relatively small volume of tissue sampled by TBBX. Finally, there is well-described variability in interobserver interpretation of TBBX for A-grade ACR, with k values ranging from 0.183 to 0.479. 6\u22128 Furthermore, the interobserver agreement for B-grade ACR, or LB, was even worse, with k values ranging from \u00a10.042 to 0.465. 6\u22128 This limited ability to safely and reliably diagnose ACR may affect clinicians' ability to mitigate risk and prevent CLAD.",

In 2008, our center adopted the revised nomenclature for B-grade rejection (B0, B1R, and B2R). Because the specimens used in this study span this change in nomenclature, we could only consider LB as present or absent. Biopsy results were based upon chart review of clinical read only. Slides were not re-reviewed. Agrade ACR episodes were also categorized as either spirometrically significant (SSAR) or non-SSAR based on a \u226510% decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) from the baseline, defined as the highest of the 2 preceding FEV 1 measurements, as described by Davis et al. 11 A-grade ACR episodes without a paired FEV 1 measurement between 0 and 14 days before the biopsy could not be classified as SSAR or non-SSAR. CLAD was defined as a sustained drop in FEV 1 by at least 20% from the average of the 2 best post-transplant measurements, consistent with published criteria. 12 For each potential CLAD case, we reviewed available clinical data to exclude alternative causes of FEV 1 decline other than CLAD.",

This 4-gene model achieved an AUC of 0.72 in the training set ( Figure 3a) . We then defined a classification threshold that favored specificity (76%) over sensitivity (54%), which yielded 70% classification accuracy (Figure 3b ). In the independent test set of 54 samples, the model exhibited similar performance with an AUC of 0.72 (Figure 3c ). The performance of the classification threshold was also similar to the training set, with specificity of 82%, sensitivity of 60%, and accuracy of 76% (Figure 3d ). In the total cohort (training and testing sets combined), the proportion of TBBX A-grade ACR classified as ACR by our genomic analysis model increased with increasing A-grade (Figure 4) . Similarly, 100% (6/6) of SSAR cases were classified as ACR in our model, compared with 56.2% (18/32) of A-grade ACR cases that were non-SSAR (p = 0.067).",

For instance, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes TCR signaling pathway was enriched 21.5-fold during A-grade ACR, including genes for CD8a, CD8b, lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK), and CD3e. CD8 acts to stabilize binding of the TCR to the peptide-major histocompatibility complex, while also localizing LCK to the TCR/CD3 complex to facilitate early signaling events during T-cell activation. 23 We have also previously shown that BAL CP gene expression of CD8 and LCK is associated with the development of CLAD. 24 In addition, the cytokine\u2212cytokine receptor interaction pathway was enriched 6.5-fold and included CXCR3 and interferon gamma. This finding is corroborated by previous work showing that protein concentrations of the interferon gamma\u2212inducible CXCR3-binding chemokines in the BAL fluid are associated with A-grade ACR and other lung injury patterns, as well as with CLAD. 25\u221227 Finally, enrichment for pathways related to cell adhesion, NK cell\u2212mediated cytotoxicity, and allograft rejection add additional support of the biological relevance of BAL CP gene expression during A-grade ACR.",

We chose a threshold for the model that prioritized specificity over sensitivity. Our rationale was aimed at better identifying clinically significant ACR at high risk of progression to CLAD. Recognizing the well-described shortcomings of TBBX, it is not surprising that our model reclassifies cases of histopathologic A-grade ACR as no ACR and other cases of no histopathologic A-grade ACR as positive for ACR. The performance of this genomic classifier improved with increasing histopathologic A-grade, for which there is reported greater observer agreement and therefore confidence in the ACR diagnosis. 6\u22128 In addition, our classifier model indicated ACR for all cases of SSAR, which is a strong risk factor for CLAD. 11 Given the importance of ACR as a potentially modifiable CLAD risk factor, our most intriguing finding is that classification indicating ACR also discriminated risk of CLAD-free survival, especially in the year following biopsy, whereas a histopathologic diagnosis of A-grade ACR did not. Finally, the highest incidence of CLAD or death in the year after biopsy was seen in the 37 cases where histopathology was negative for A-grade ACR but where the genomic classifier predicted ACR. None of these cases were treated for rejection at the time. We can hypothesize that corticosteroid treatment could have reduced the risk of CLAD in this group, but this hypothesis requires prospective evaluation in a clinical trial.",

In studies of T-cell activation, there has been a high correlation of gene expression profiles between RNASeq and microarray platforms using the same set of samples. 30 However, RNASeq was superior in detecting low abundance transcripts and demonstrated a broader dynamic range than microarray, therefore allowing the detection of more differentially expressed genes. Furthermore, performing RNASeq allows for the avoidance of technical issues found using microarray probes (e.g., cross-hybridization, non-specific hybridization, and limited detection range of individual probes). In addition, RNASeq does not rely on pre-designed detection probes; thus, there are no issues associated with probe redundancy and annotation, which simplifies the interpretation of the data.",

IL-32 is expressed by IL-2\u2212activated T cells and NK cells and plays a role in acute graft-versus-host disease after hematopoietic cell transplantation. 33 KLRK1 is a receptor expressed by NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes; it mediates activation in NK cells and costimulation in T cells. 34 Collectively, this 4-gene model is consistent with the paradigm of ACR and CLAD pathobiology. Specifically, ACR is characterized by activated immune cells including CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, NK cells, and NK T cells, which drive the cytotoxicity responsible for allograft injury that eventually leads to CLAD.

Gene expression to diagnose ACR could be a less invasive alternative to TBBX. In fact, we found that differential gene expression can be simplified to a 4-gene signature with fair performance as a surrogate for TBBX, but with potentially greater clinical implications. This study demonstrates proof of concept that BAL CP gene expression informs about the pathogenesis of ACR and risk of CLAD. A multicenter study is required to establish whether BAL CP gene expression could reduce or eliminate the need for TBBX to diagnose ACR.",
