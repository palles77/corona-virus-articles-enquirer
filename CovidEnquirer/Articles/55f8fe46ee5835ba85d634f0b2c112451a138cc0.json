            "text": "Phenothiazine and derivatives were tested for inhibition of SARS-CoV replication. Phenothiazine slightly inhibited SARS-CoV replication in a neutral red (NR) uptake assay. Adding a propylamino group to give promazine reduced virus yields (VYR assay) with an EC 90 = 8.3 \u00b1 2.8 M, but without selectivity. Various substitutions in the basic phenothiazine structure did not promote efficacy. Phenazine ethosulfate was the most potent compound by VYR assay (EC 90 = 6.1 \u00b1 4.3 M). All compounds were toxic (IC 50 = 6.6-74.5 M) except for phenoxathiin (IC 50 = 858 \u00b1 208 M) and 10-(alpha-diethylamino-propionyl) phenothiazine\u00b7HCl (IC 50 = 195 \u00b1 71.2 M). Consequently, none were selective inhibitors of SARS-CoV replication (SI values <1-3.3 M). These data portended the poor efficacy of promazine in a SARS-CoV mouse lung replication model. Intraperitoneal treatment with promazine using a prophylactic (\u22124 h)/therapeutic regimen of 1, 10, or 50 mg/(kg day) did not reduce virus lung titers at day 3, yet prolonged virus replication to 14 days. Similar therapeutic promazine doses were not efficacious. Thus, promazine did not affect SARS-CoV replication in vitro or in vivo, nor were any other phenothiazines efficacious in reducing virus replication. Therefore, treating SARS infections with compounds like promazine is not warranted.",

The initial outbreak of SARS infection rapidly spread through the human population due to international travel, reaching nearly 30 countries by the middle of 2003 (De Clercq, 2006) ; this episode possibly being a portent of epidemics of the future. The overall mortality rate was 10%, and up to 50% within the elderly population (De Clercq, 2006) . The epidemic resulted in about 8000 probable cases of SARS with 800 deaths attributed to the virus infection. There were also four confirmed cases of SARS in Ghangzou, China in late 2003 and early 2004 (Liang et al., 2004; Song et al., 2005) . Two subsequent outbreaks were contained rapidly and were due to the escape of the virus from laboratories doing SARS-CoV research (Lim et al., 2006) .",

The positive data have prompted recommendations that these types of drugs be considered as therapies for SARS infections or as lead compounds for development of more potent derivatives.

Most compounds exhibited considerable toxicity with the exception of phenoxathiin and 10-(alphadiethylaminopropionyl)phenothiazine\u00b7HCL.

Most of the other compounds tested against the other SARS-CoV strains were also inhibitory at similar concentrations using either assay with the exception of 10-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinymethyl)-phenothiazine-HCl. The antiviral activity shown in Table 1 was not due to virucidal activity, at least for promazine, since virus exposure to promazine for 1 h at 25 \u2022 C did not result in virus titer reduc-tion (data not shown).

In addition, derivatives of phenothiazine with side chains that enhanced solubility or had side chains of electron withdrawing ring structures (trifluoperazine, acetophenazine, perphenazine) were also more inhibitory of SARS-CoV replication (EC 90 = 8.4-10.2 M), suggesting that these compounds may act as soluble prodrugs of phenothiazine (Fig. 1B) . This effect seemed to be abrogated if methoxy, acetyl or propionyl groups were added to the two position of the basic ring structure to the Substituting N with O in the phenothiazine nucleus to get phenoxathiin resulted in a much less potent and much less toxic compound (phenoxathiin EC 50 = 763 M vs. EC 50 phenothiazine = 21.5 M). However, substituting the S group in phenothiazine with O resulted in a less potent compound, phenoxazine, which was also less toxic. The nitrogen in the phenothiazine basic ring structure may not be essential for antiviral activity since its removal from the ring, as in for example, chlorprothixene, resulted in inhibition of virus replication similar to that detected with promazine.",

            "text": "In contrast, in placebo-treated, infected mice, the infection in the lungs was cleared by day 7 as has previously been shown by others Barnard et al., 2006) . Despite the fact that virus persisted to day 14 in promazine-treated mice, histopathogical examination of lungs from treated, infected animals showed no signs of pathology consistent with a virus lung infection or consistent with drug-induced cytotoxicity. Treating mice with 100 mg/(kg day) promazine (\u22124 h, then 8, 32, 56 h after virus exposure) was lethal to all mice by day 3 (Table 3) . For reference, the reported LD 50 of promazine given to mice i.p. is 140 mg/(kg day) (Yen and Day, 1965) . Mice were also treated therapeutically with promazine. Treatment of mice with promazine at 100 mg/(kg day) beginning 8 h after virus exposure was somewhat lethal as well; most animals died between day 3 and day 7 (Table 4 ). All doses of promazine used therapeutically did not inhibit virus replication in the lungs. Although the 10 mg/kg dose administered once a day either one time or three times beginning 8 h after virus exposure did seem to slightly increase the amount of virus recovered from lungs at day 3 compared to placebo, neither the 10 or 1 mg/kg doses significantly prolonged virus infection as happened with the more frequent dosing schedule. The 100 mg/kg dose killed all the control animals as well as the infected, treated animals by day 7. SARS-CoV infection (placebo-treated, uninfected mice) caused a significant increase (p < 0.05) in the production of cytokines IL1-\u2423, IL1\u2424, IL-4, IL-10, IL12, MIP-1a, GM-CSF and RANTES when compared to untreated, infected mice (Fig. 2) . In uninfected mice, promazine treatment alone caused a significant increases (P < 0.05 to P < 0.005) in IL1-\u2423, IL1\u2424, IL-2 (50 mg/kg dose only), IL-3, IL-4, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12, TNF-alpha (50 mg/kg dose only), MIP-1 (50 mg/kg dose only), and RANTES, but not in IL-6, MCP-1, or GM-CSF, compared to uninfected, untreated mice. Interestingly, promazine administered to infected mice at 50 mg/kg seemed to promote much higher levels of IL-6 than was detectable in untreated, infected mice or in uninfected mice treated with promazine. In infected animals treated with 50 mg/kg promazine, RANTES titers were significantly lower (P < 0.05) than in the lungs of untreated, infected mice. Promazine treatment of infected mice did not significantly affect other cytokines levels in compared to untreated, infected mice. Cytokine levels in lung samples from mice sacrificed 7 or 14 days post-infection were not significantly different when comparing treated, infected mice and untreated, infected mice (data not shown) and by day 14 there were no detectable increases in cytokine levels, regardless of treatment (data not shown).",

However in the studies presented here, in which the in vitro assays were repeated four times using independent experiments to confirm all EC 50 and IC 50 values unlike the data reported in other studies, we were unable to show any convincing antiviral data for promazine or related compounds nor were we able to show efficacy of promazine in an animal model. In fact, it is likely that the cytotoxic properties of the compounds accounted for any slight in vitro inhibition of virus detected in the current studies.",

Three phenazines were predicted to be inhibitors of the SARS-CoV main protease through docking predictions and virtual screening. When these compounds were actually evaluated in enzymatic assays, the three phenothiazines inhibited the enzyme activity by 11-15% . In addition, promazine, a phenothiazine, might also inhibit the SARS-CoV main protease. Zhang and Yap (2004) in a computational study have shown that promazine can bind to amino acid residues in the Domain I of the protease. However, the binding affinity would probably not be sufficient to cause effective inhibition of the enzyme.",

            "text": "The observation that promazine promotes the induction of certain proinflammatory cytokines in schizophrenics may actually account for the prolongation of virus infection in mice observed in the current study when mice were pretreated with promazine. Treatment of schizophrenics with promazine seemed to induce some proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-\u2423, which in turn stimulated highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Kaminska et al., 2003) . Induction of proinflammatory cytokines also occurs in many viral respiratory infections including SARS Barnard et al., 2006) . Glass et al. (2004) found that SARS-CoV infection in mice was characterized by a proinflammatory cytokine storm, including the induction of IL-6 and TNF-\u2423. We have found that ribavirin exacerbates the SARS-CoV-induced cytokine storm leading to a prolongation of viral replication in the lungs of infected animals (Barnard et al., 2006) . In addition, promazine at 50 mg/(kg day) seemed to significantly decrease RANTES expression, an important chemokine promoting neutrophil migration to the SARS-CoV infection site (Yen et al., 2006) . Promazine, by suppressing RANTES levels might have allowed virus to persist because of a lack of a good robust, neutrophil response to the initial infection. Thus, the low-dose promazine treatments (50 mg/(kg day)) used in the current study may have altered the SARS-CoV-perturbed cytokine levels resulting in a prolonged infection and suppression of key chemokines necessary for clearance of virus after day 3, leading to a persistent virus infection. However, the exacerbation of the infection may be dependent on the frequency and the timing of treatment administration; less frequent dosing without a pretreatment before virus exposure resulted in no prolongation of virus infection and in no reduction of virus lung titers; RANTES expression was unaffected at lower doses promazine.",

When one of the phenothiazines, promazine, was evaluated in a SARS-CoV replication model in mice, toxicity was manifested at the highest dose of promazine treatment administered i.p. (100 mg/(kg day)), resulting in death of all animals treated regardless of dosing schedule or regimen. This observation validated the significant toxicity detected in vitro with many of the phenothiazines evaluated in vitro. Even though a two-fold lower dose of promazine was much less toxic in mice, virus lung titers were not reduced. Lower doses of promazine (50 and 10 mg/(kg day)), when administered frequently and just prior to virus exposure, significantly prolonged the infection. Given the almost total lack of inhibition of virus replication in mice except at one dose, the narrow concentration window between lethality and survival and the potential for prolongation of virus infection in animals, promazine and its prodrugs should not be considered potential therapies for SARS infections.",
