Whether this strategy will achieve control depends on characteristics of both the pathogen and the response. Here we use a mathematical model to assess if isolation and contact tracing are able to control onwards transmission from imported cases of COVID-19.",

We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in the number of initial cases, the basic reproduction number (R 0 ), the delay from symptom onset to isolation, the probability that contacts were traced, the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort.",

Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R 0 of 1\u00b75 were controllable with less than 50% of contacts successfully traced. To control the majority of outbreaks, for R 0 of 2\u00b75 more than 70% of contacts had to be traced, and for an R 0 of 3\u00b75 more than 90% of contacts had to be traced. The delay between symptom onset and isolation had the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable when R 0 was 1\u00b75. For R 0 values of 2\u00b75 or 3\u00b75, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset.",

Therefore, we explored a range of epidemiological scenarios that represent potential transmission properties based on current information about COVID-19 transmission. We assessed the ability of isolation and contact tracing to control disease outbreaks in areas without widespread transmission using a mathematical model. 6, [15] [16] [17] By varying the efficacy of contact-tracing efforts, the size of the outbreak when detected, and the promptness of isolation after symptom onset, we show how viable it is for countries at risk of imported cases to use contact tracing and isolation as a containment strategy.",

Secondary cases were only created if the person with the infection had not been isolated by the time of infection. As an example (figure 1), a person infected with the virus could potentially produce three secondary infections (because three is drawn from the negative binomial distribution), but only two transmissions might occur before the case is isolated.

Outbreaks that reached 5000 cumulative cases were assumed to be too large to control within 12-16 weeks, and were categorised as uncontrolled outbreaks. Based on this definition, we reported the probability that an outbreak of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-like pathogen would be controlled within 12 weeks for each scenario, assuming that the basic reproduction number remained constant and no other interventions were implemented. The probability that an outbreak is controlled gives a one-dimensional understanding of the difficulty of achieving control, because the model placed no constraints on the number of cases and contacts that could be traced and isolated. In reality, the feasibility of contact tracing and isolation is likely to be determined both by the probability of achieving control, and the resources needed to trace and isolate infected cases. 32 We therefore reported the weekly maximum number of cases undergoing contact tracing and isolation for each scenario that resulted in outbreak control. New cases require their contacts to be traced, and if these numbers are high, it can overwhelm the contact-tracing system and affect the quality of the contact-tracing effort. 33 It is likely that the upper limit on contacts to trace varies from country to country.",

At a reproduction number of 1\u00b75, the effect of isolation was coupled with the chance of stochastic extinction resulting from overdispersion, 19 which is why some outbreaks were controlled even at 0% contacts traced. Isolation and contact tracing decreased transmission, as shown by a decrease in the effective reproduction number ( figure 3) . When the basic reproduction number was 1\u00b75, the median estimate rapidly fell below 1, which indicated that control was probable. For the higher transmission scenarios, a higher level of contact tracing was needed to bring the median effective reproduction number below 1.

More than 40% of these outbreaks were controlled with no contact tracing because of the combined effects of isolation of symptomatic cases and stochastic extinction. The probability of control dropped as the number of initial cases increased-eg, for 40 initial cases, 80% contact tracing did not lead to 80% of simulations controlled within 3 months. The delay from symptom onset to isolation had a major role in achieving control of outbreaks ( figure 4) . At 80% of contacts traced, the probability of achieving control fell from 89% to 31%, with a long delay from onset to isolation. If no transmission occurred before symptom onset, then the probability of achieving control was higher for all values of contacts traced ( figure 4) . The difference between 15% and 30% of transmission before symptoms had a marked effect on probability to control. We found this effect in all scenarios tested (appendix p 5). In scenarios in which only 10% of cases were asymptomatic, the probability that simulations were controlled by isolation and contact tracing for all values of contact tracing decreased ( figure 4) . For 80% of contacts traced, only 37% of outbreaks were controlled, compared with 89% without subclinical infection.

Case isolation was more effective when there was little transmission before symptom onset and when the delay from symptom onset to isolation was short. Preventing transmission by tracing and isolating a larger proportion of contacts, thereby decreasing the effective reproduction number, improved the number of scenarios in which control was likely to be achieved.

This scenario echoes other suggestions that highly effective contact tracing will be necessary to control outbreaks in other countries. 16 In scenarios in which the delay from onset to isolation was long, similar to the delays in the early phase of the outbreak in Wuhan, the same contact tracing success of 80% achieved a probability of containing an outbreak of less than 40%.

At the same time, it assumed that isolation of cases and contacts is completely effective, and that all symptomatic cases are eventually reported. Relaxing these assumptions would decrease the probability that control is achieved. We also make the assumption that contact is required for transmission between two individuals, but transmission via fomites might be possible. This type of transmission would make effective contact tracing challenging, and good respiratory and hand hygiene would be crucial to reduce this route of transmission, coupled with environmental decontamination in health-care settings. For this reason, we used contact-tracing percentage intervals of 20% to avoid indicating more precision in the corresponding probability of control than the model could support. We simplified our model to determine the effect of contact tracing and isolation on the control of outbreaks under different scenarios of transmission; however, as more data becomes available, the model can be updated or tailored to particular public health contexts. The robustness of control measures is likely to be affected both by differences in transmission between countries, but also by the concurrent number of cases that require contact tracing in each scenario. Practically, there is likely to be an upper bound on the number of cases that can be traced, which might vary by country, and case isolation is likely to be imperfect. 34 We reported the maximum number of weekly cases during controlled outbreaks, but the capacity of response efforts might vary. In addition to the number of contacts, other factors could decrease the percentage of contacts that can be traced, such as cooperation of the community with the public health response.",

Similar analyses using branching models have already been used to analyse the Wuhan outbreak to find plausible ranges for the initial exposure event size and the basic reproduction number. 15, 18 Our analysis expands on this work by including infectiousness before the onset of symptoms, case isolation, explicit modelling of case incubation periods, and time to infectiousness. A key area of uncertainty is whether, and for how long, individuals are infectious before symptom onset, and whether subclinical infection occurs; both are likely to make the outbreak harder to control. 22 Whether, and how much, transmission occurs before symptoms is difficult to quantify. Under-reporting of prodromal symptoms, such as fatigue and mild fever, is possible; thus, transmission might not truly be occurring before symptoms, but before noticeable symptoms. There is evidence of transmission before onset, 30 and so we used 15%. Increased awareness of prodromal symptoms, and therefore short delays until isolation-as seen in the SARS outbreak in Beijing in 2003 35 -would increase control of outbreaks in our model. If contact tracing included testing of non-symptomatic contacts, those contacts could be quarantined without symptoms, which would decrease transmission in the model. Costs associated with additional testing might not be possible in all contexts.",
