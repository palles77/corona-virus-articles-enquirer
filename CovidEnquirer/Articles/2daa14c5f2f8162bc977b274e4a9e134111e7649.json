The annual average incidence increased from 1\u00b7457 per 100 000 people in 2004 to 4\u00b77638 per 100 000 people in 2011 (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 3\u00b727, 95% CI 3\u00b722-3\u00b732; p<0\u00b70001), peaking in 2015 (5\u00b70092 per 100 000 people). The annual incidence after the 2011 upsurge of scarlet fever, between 2011 and 2016, was twice the average annual incidence reported between 2004 and 2010 (4\u00b70125 vs 1\u00b79105 per 100 000 people; IRR 2\u00b707, 95% CI 2\u00b706-2\u00b709; p<0\u00b70001).

Prevention and control strategies being implemented in response to this threat include improving disease surveillance and emergency response systems.

To observe the seasonality in each province or area, we first standardised the monthly incidence of scarlet fever for different areas and then applied a radar chart to display the z score of incidence in each area by using R package fmsb. 15 Each radar chart has 12 spikes representing the 12 months of the year, and different colours indicate different years. 9 We used Joinpoint regression software (version 4.5.0.1; appendix p 5), developed by the National Cancer Institute, to examine the annual percentage change of the crude incidence rate from 2004 to 2016. 9 We used the t test to assess whether an annual percentage change was significantly different from zero; p values were from a two-sided test, with a value of 0\u00b705 indicating significance. We used a parametric method as joinpoint regression (parametric and empirical quantile types) to calculate the 95% CIs. In describing patterns, an increase or decrease is proven when the slope of annual percentage change is significant (p<0\u00b705). A stable trend refers to a non-significant annual percentage change (p\u22650\u00b705). We used the \u03c7\u00b2 test to compare the different proportions of infected people by sex, year, and occupation. We used a Mann-Whitney U test to compare the time intervals between the two epidemic periods (2004-10 and 2011-16).",

All nine patients were aged 4-15 years, with a mean age of 8\u00b75 years (SD 4), and the group comprised six boys and three girls (appendix p 23). The median number of days from onset to diagnosis was 4 days (range 0-5), the median number of days from onset to death was 7 days (range 1-28), and the median number of days from diagnosis to death was 4 days (range 0-25). The median number of days from onset to diagnosis, onset to report date, and diagnosis to report date in the period after the upsurge of disease was significantly shorter than it had been before the upsurge (all p<0\u00b705; appendix p 24). For clinically confirmed cases, the median time from disease onset to reporting the disease decreased from 4 days in 2004-10 to 3 days in 2011-16 (p=0\u00b7001; appendix p 24).",

In the mid-19th century, scarlet fever epidemics were found to follow 4-year pattern, but this pattern disappeared during the 20th century with the widespread application of antibiotics. In China, over the past 66 years, scarlet fever epidemics have had four stages, including high incidence (1950-79), decrease (1980-94), low incidence (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) , and resurgence (2011-16). 16 Through these four stages, the disease cycle has been approximately every 6 years. 16 The 2011 upsurge in the incidence of scarlet fever could signal a return to a highincidence stage of the disease. 16 A third reason might be an increased number of susceptible children in China after the loosening of the one-child policy, which started in 2011. 11, 12 Consistent with this idea, the incidence of childhood infectious diseases that are not preventable by vaccine (eg, diarrhoea) has increased in the past 5 years. Finally, improvements in early surveillance and warning could have been contributed to by increased reporting, as has been seen with the increased diagnosis of infectious diseases in China since the NNIDSS was created. 9, 22 However, the reasons for resurgence of scarlet fever in Hong Kong, South Korea, and England cannot be fully explained by these same factors, and further studies are needed.",

This difference is due to several factors. First, differences in meteorological effects could partly explain the variation. 23 In northern China, people stay indoors more with closed windows and doors during the cold season (October-April), which leads to bad ventilation and increases the chance of infection. Second, site-to-site differences in risk factors might have been present, such as long-term exposure to severe air pollutants in northern regions, which could have been a risk factor for infection. 24 Finally, group A streptococcus epidemiological surveillance has shown that the proportion of group A streptococcus emm12 gene type strains was gradually replaced by emm1 gene types in some areas in the north of China from 2011 to 2014, leading to minimal crossimmunity. 16, 25 Our age profiling of scarlet fever infections is consistent with those from other countries, with scarlet fever commonly affecting children younger than 10 years. 1, 3, 5, 16 The paucity of infections among children younger than 6 months was most likely due to protection through maternal antibodies. The highest incidence of scarlet fever was found among children aged 6 years and the pattern of increasing incidence was apparent in children aged 3-4 years. This pattern could be partly attributable to the paucity of herd immunity among children aged 3-6 years to group A streptococcus infection; 16 another cause could be restricted protection conferred by antibodies toward the M protein, with little cross-immunity toward other types of M protein. 2, [26] [27] [28] Our findings indicate that boys and men have a higher risk of infection than girls and women, in all age groups, which could be attributable to more physical interactions or poorer personal hygiene among boys than among girls. 29 Thus, in the future, specific strategies and measures should target preschool aged children and boys. 28 Scarlet fever was observed to have a dual seasonal pattern in China, with different patterns in some regions. Areas in the north and south of China had semi-annual seasonal patterns peaking in May-June and November-December, whereas areas in southwest China had only one peak in May-June. Geographical differences in seasonal patterns could have been associated with climatic and demographic factors. Our study indicated that the incidence of scarlet fever decreased substantially during school holidays in China. The seasonal patterns in China were similar to those in Hong Kong and South Korea, but different from those in Poland (which peaked in January and March) and England (which peaked in February-March). 1, 3, 6, 30 The length and timing of the school holidays might have contributed to the different seasonal patterns in east Asia and Europe.",

For those patients who died, older age (mean 8\u00b75 years) and delayed diagnosis (median 4 days since disease onset) could have contributed to the mortality risk. However, co-occurring diseases could also be a contributing factor to mortality risk, as discussed by Lau and colleagues' in their report of the scarlet fever outbreak in Hong Kong in 2011, 33 in which two children with scarlet fever died who had underlying medical illnesses (co-infected with chickenpox). Generally, in the current phase of the disease in China, although the number of scarlet fever cases has increased, the disease severity was mild and did not change from before to after the upsurge.",
