Nurses' disaster competence, motivation for disaster engagement, and factors that impact their motivation to respond to disaster events need to be understood. The purposes of the study were to determine the predictive relationships between Taiwanese nurses' disaster competence, anticipatory disaster stress, and motivation for disaster engagement. A cross-sectional design was used to analyze data collected between August 2017 and December 2017 from eight hospitals in southern Taiwan. Ninety participants who met the recruitment criteria completed and returned questionnaires with an 88.24% response rate. Data collection involved administering the Disaster Nursing Competence Questionnaire, Anticipatory Disaster Stress Questionnaire, and the Motivation of Disaster Engagement Questionnaire. The results indicated that anticipatory disaster stress was positively correlated with disaster competence and motivation for disaster engagement. Disaster competence and willingness to join a hospital disaster rescue predicts an individuals' motivation for disaster engagement. The results of the study add to the understanding of factors that correlate with nurses' motivation to participate in disaster events. By understanding these factors, the government and healthcare administrators can design disaster education plans and other strategies to improve Taiwanese nurses' motivation to engage in disaster events.",

Examples of major disasters in Taiwan include the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, the Kaohsiung massive gas explosions in 2014, and the Taiwan Water Park Blast in 2015. These disasters have resulted in many injuries and fatalities, as well as economic losses, serious environmental disruption, and lasting psychological trauma among survivors [1, 2] . According to the 2018 World Disasters Report [3] , there were 3751 recorded disasters from 2008 to 2017, and 79.8% of these reported disasters occurred in Asian countries. Asians accounted for the largest number of people affected by these disasters. In fact, the percentage of disasters occurring in Asia was 37% in the 1998-2007 decade, and it increased to 41% in the 2008-2017 decade [3] . Likewise, the frequency and intensity of disaster events in Taiwan have noticeably increased in recent years. In 2016, the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters reported that Taiwan was one of the top 10 countries in terms of disaster mortality that year [4] . These statistics amplify the importance of sound disaster training and preparation so that nurses can respond effectively and appropriately during a disaster event in Taiwan.",

In light of this, issues about the current level of competence, skills, and experience in disaster preparedness and response among nurses have been valued and emphasized [5, 6] . Studies focused on disaster nursing in Taiwan and other countries revealed that existing preparedness for and competence in disaster response among hospital personnel including nurses is less than optimal [7] [8] [9] and is often fragmented, or not available at all [5] . Moreover, they may not be ready to face future disasters because of an inadequate disaster competence such as a lack of awareness of the roles and skills needed when encountering disaster events [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .",

Studies found that nurses felt psychologically unprepared when asked to engage in disaster events [18, 19] because the events might exceed their capacity to function well, or they worried about their personal loss or their families' welfare during disaster relief [17, 20] . Additionally, nurses had less desire to report to work during an emergency or disaster event, although most strongly believed that they are responsible for working during such situations [13, 21] . Moreover, few nurses were motivated to engage in practical preparation and obtain the experience required to deploy in response to a disaster event [6, 10] . In one study, some nurses openly commented that they were frustrated and were not motivated to engage in disaster trainings because of their heavy workloads and lack of time for attending educational programs [20] . Yet, other surveys reported that many hospitals or service organizations do not frequently conduct exercises to determine their level of preparedness for disaster management, which may be due to the economic burden of undergoing training exercises [22] . Therefore, it is critical to understand how to help disaster nurses overcome personal stress and assist others, such as colleagues and survivors, to effectively cope with stress as well [16] .",

Our findings were similar to previous studies that reported a low level of self-reported familiarity with preparedness among nurses for large-scale emergency or disaster events [12, 29, 30] . This finding implies that most hospital nurses may not be ready or confident in their abilities to respond to disaster events. Contrary to prior studies which revealed that work unit or specialty, work experiences, educational level, and gender were associated with disaster competence [31, 32] , our analysis did not support such findings. Rather, we found that nurses who exhibited higher competence had attended in-service education or conferences about disaster nursing. Interestingly, most hospitals held massive disaster courses or practices every year; however, nurses' attendance rates to these educational offerings were not high. In addition, although the participation rates of field drills were high, nurses did not perceive that they were competent in disaster management. This situation is similar to Williams et al.'s article which reviewed 258 studies and found that the effects of disaster training on health care workers' knowledge and skills in disaster response were inconclusive. The authors suggested that hospitals should urgently examine and find the most appropriate methods for disaster preparedness practices for nurses in order to augment the authentic efficiency of the training [2] .",

            "text": "Since most nurses in our study did not have any experience in disaster field rescue and also did not attend disaster management at their hospital, it may be hard for them to imagine how stressful it would be to participate in a real disaster management situation. This may be the reason for the finding of a low level of anticipatory disaster stress. Additionally, although the level of anticipatory disaster stress was not high, only 53.3% of nurses agreed or strongly agreed to join their hospital's disaster rescue when they were asked to do so. Further analysis found that the participants who strongly agreed to join a hospital disaster rescue had significantly higher stress levels than nurses who did not agree to participate in a disaster relief. Somehow, anticipatory disaster stress existed, but only for nurses who have motivation to attend disaster events in the future. In the study, the degree of nurses' motivation for disaster engagement was not high. The results correspond to the earlier studies, which indicated that few nurses intended to report for work during disasters [13, 35, 36] ; moreover, few nurses have the motivation to engage in practical preparation and obtain experiences in response to a disaster event [6] . Specifically, we found that nurses who had attended care management of disaster aftermaths had lower motivation for disaster engagement. The fear of being incapable of managing disaster aftermaths and the worry that no one can take care of their family or children when they cannot get out of their duty might have made them reluctant to attend field rescue or care management of disaster aftermaths [17, 35] . Former surveys reported that nurses did not feel supported or motivated to engage in disaster preparedness because of their heavy workloads, and the hospitals in which they were employed did not regularly conduct exercises to prepare them for disaster management [8, 16, 22] . Although hospitals in Taiwan held disaster education or practice every year, nurses reported being physically and mentally exhausted by their heavy daily workload on top of having difficulty in finding the time to participate in educational programs that were not directly work-related. Therefore, as shown by a previous study that showed a perceived well-ordered organizational climate can arouse individuals' motivation and consequently cause emergent behaviors [37] , a perception of being supported by the work environment is a meaningful motivational factor in healthcare workers' decision to work during a disaster. Interestingly, the study found that nurses who were more competent in disaster nursing felt more stress. This situation might be because nurses may believe that they will never be competent enough when facing an unpredictable disaster. Additionally, disaster competence and anticipatory disaster stress were significantly and positively correlated with nurses' motivation to engage in disaster events. However, both disaster competence and anticipatory disaster stress could not predict motivation to engage in disaster events. The Self-Determination Theory proposes that competence is one of the significant factors influencing individuals' motivation in engagement behaviors [25] . And, other studies pointed out that individuals would move toward activities and took on responsibilities or challenges when they felt more confident in their disaster competence and knowledge [13, 24, 38, 39] . In our study, nurses' did not perceive high level of disaster competence and therefore might not be motivated to participate in disaster management.",
