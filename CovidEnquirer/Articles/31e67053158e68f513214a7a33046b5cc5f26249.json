            "text": "25 Nutritional stress, and especially a dearth of pollen, is considered an important factor associated 26 with honey bee colony losses. We used pollen-restricted colonies as a model to study the 27 nutritional stress conditions experienced in colonies within intensively cultivated agricultural 28 areas. This model was complemented by the establishment of an experimental design, which 29 allowed us to uncouple the effect of nutrition, behavior and age in colonies of similar size and 30 demography. We used this system to determine the effect of pollen restriction on workers' 31 behavioral development. Then, we analyzed the effect of nutritional stress, behavior and age on 32 the expression of key physiological genes involved in the regulation of division of labor. Finally, 33 we analyzed the effects of these variables on the expression of immune genes and the titers of 34 honey bee viruses. Our results show that pollen restriction led to an increased number of 35 precocious foragers and this behavioral transition was associated with important changes in the 36 expression of nutritionally regulated physiological genes, immunity and viral titers. Vitellogenin 37 (vg) and major royal jelly protein 1 (mrjp1) were the most predictive markers of nutrition and 38 behavior. The expression of immune genes was primarily affected by behavior, with higher levels 39 in foragers. Deformed wing virus (DWV) titers were significantly affected by behavior and 40 nutritional status, with higher titer in foragers and increased levels associated with pollen 41 ingestion. Correlation analyses support the predominant effect of behavior on immunity and 42 susceptibility to viral infection, revealing that both immune genes and DWV exhibited strong 43 negative correlations with genes associated with nursing, but positive correlations with genes 44 associated with foraging. Our results provide valuable insights into the physiological mechanisms 45 by which nutritional stress induce precocious foraging and increased susceptibility to viral 46 infections. 48 Approximately 35-40% of the world's crop production comes from plant species that depend on 49 animal pollination [1] which is carried out primarily by honey bees [2]. However, populations of 50 honey bees have experienced a severe decline during recent years worldwide [3, 4]. Possible 51 causes for colony losses have been proposed, including the effects of pesticides [5], nutritional 52 stress [6-8], the parasitic mite Varroa destructor [9, 10] and synergistic interactions between 53 Varroa and honey bee viruses [11]. However, none of these independent factors is consistently 54 associated with colony losses to suggest a single causal agent [3]. Thus, colony losses are likely 55 the result of the combination of several underlying factors [12, 13].",

            "text": "56 57 There are several lines of evidence indicating that nutritional stress is an important contributing 58 factor for colony losses. First, there is a positive relationship between the area of uncultivated 59 forage land surrounding an apiary and annual colony survival [6, 8] suggesting that habitat loss 60 play a significant role in honeybee colony losses. Second, at individual levels, honey bees from 61 colonies kept in areas of high cultivation exhibited decreased levels of physiological biomarkers 62 associated with nutrition compared with bees kept in areas of low cultivation [7, 14], 63 demonstrating that availability of floral resources affects the nutritional state of honey bees. 64 65 Habitat loss associated with increased use of monocultures reduces both the quality (diversity of 66 plant sources) and the quantity of the pollen collected by the bees [15]. Simultaneous flowering in 67 monocultures provide pollen for a restricted period, and hives surrounded by monocultures 68 presumably experience pollen dearth before and after this period. Pollen is the main source of 69 proteins and lipids for honey bees [16, 17] and pollen from different plants differ in amino acid 70 content [18, 19] and fatty acids [20]. Thus, the consumption of pollen from diverse plant sources 71 increases the probability of obtaining the set of nutritional components (e.g., essential amino 4 72 acids and fatty acids) required for balanced nutrition. 73 74 Plasticity is a key feature of honey bee behavioral development [21], which is important for 75 understanding the consequences of nutritional stress on colony health and fitness. In the honey 76 bee, as in other eusocial insects, behavioral division of labor in workers is initially age-dependent 77 [21, 22]. Under typical spring and summer conditions in temperate climates, honey bee lifespan is 78 approximately one month. During the first two to three weeks of adult life, workers perform tasks 79 in the hive such as brood care (\"nursing\"); while in the last one to two weeks of life, workers 80 forage for food outside the colony [23, 24]. However, honey bee behavioral development is 81 flexible and can be accelerated or delayed according to colony demography and as an adaptive 82 response to different challenges [21]. In particular, the timing of nurse to forager transition is 83 normally accelerated in response to diverse types of stressors, including diseases [25] and 84 malnutrition [26]. 85 86 Interactions among key elements of the extended insulin/insulin-like growth signaling/target of 87 rapamycin (IIS/TOR) pathway including vitellogenin (Vg), juvenile hormone (JH) and insulin-88 like peptides (ILPs), regulate important physiological processes in honey bees, including 89 behavioral division of labor [27-31]. Vg is a yolk protein highly expressed in the fat bodies [29], 90 secreted into the hemolymph and then imported by developing oocytes [32]. JH, one of the major 91 insect hormones, is synthesized in the corpora allata in a final reaction catabolized by the enzyme 92 methyl farnesoate epoxidase (MFE) [33]. There are two genes encoding insulin genes (ilp1 and 93 ilp2) in the honey bee genome [34], which are expressed in several tissues and organs including 94 the brain and fat bodies [27, 29, 30]. In workers, negative interactions among vg with JH and 95 insulin like peptides are associated with task performance: while vg levels are higher in nurses 96 compared with foragers [29, 35-37], JH titers [21, 36, 38, 39] brain ilp1 and fat body ilp2 mRNA 5 97 levels follow an opposite pattern [27, 29, 30]. Experimental manipulations showed that these 98 correlations reveal causative positive and negative interactions among these three regulatory 99 elements. Thus, JH treatments inhibit vg expression [35, 40], but induce higher brain ilp1 levels 100 [29] and precocious foraging [21, 41]. Consistently, experimental reduction of vg by RNA 101 interference also result in higher levels of JH [27] and precocious foraging [28]. 102 103 In recent years, the proposal that nutrition is an important factor regulating the division of labor 104 among social insects has received increased support [26, 30, 42-46]. Pollen consumption is low in 105 young bees, largest in about 9-day-old nurses and then declines to minimal amounts in foragers 106 [47], which rely primarily on honey intake. Cage experiments showed that 6-day-old workers 107 eating pollen and sugar have higher abdominal vg and low brain ilp1 levels, while same-age bees 108 fed with only sugar had the inverse pattern [30]; resembling the expression profiles observed in 109 colony-reared nurses and foragers, respectively [29]. The effect of pollen on behavioral 110 development could result from its protein content. In support of this view, it has been shown that 111 increased levels of hemolymph amino acids, induced by protein injection, resulted in high vg 112 mRNA levels and delayed foraging [27]. Additionally, lipid metabolism also has been involved 113 in nutritional regulation of division of labor. Lipid content closely correlates with task 114 performance, being higher in nurses compared to foragers [43]. Feeding of an inhibitor of fatty 115 acid synthesis (TOFA) induced precocious foraging [48], further supporting a role of lipids on 116 the regulation of division of labor. However, it remains to be tested whether supplementary lipids 117 (e.g., essential fatty acids) have an effect on the nutritional regulation of this process. 118 119 Since genes that regulate behavioral division of labor are nutritionally regulated, they could be 120 expected to be ideal biomarkers of both nutritional and behavioral state in cage as well as colony-121 level studies. Progressive evidence is revealing that behavioral and nutritional states influence 6 122 honey bee immunity and susceptibility to pathogens. Thus, the use of reliable markers for these 123 traits can also facilitate effective disease diagnosis. Indeed, the initial use of vg as a predictive 124 marker of colony losses [49] and colony nutritional state [14] provides a promising starting point 125 toward this direction. 126 127 Although insects lack an acquired immunity, they have developed an efficient innate immune 128 system against a broad variety of pathogens [50]. Innate immunity has been traditionally divided 129 into humoral and cellular responses, but there are complex interactions and no clearly defined 130 boundaries between both types of immune responses [51]. Four main gene pathways mediate 131 insect innate immunity: Toll, IMD, JNK and JAK/ STAT, which include elements implicated in 132 both the humoral and cellular immune responses and belong to gene families involved in 133 signaling, pathogen recognition and effector functions [52, 53]. 134 135 Humoral immune responses are mainly associated with antimicrobial effectors belonging to the 136 Toll pathway such as abaecin [54], defensin1 (def1) [55] and hymenoptaecin (hym) [56]. On the 137 other hand, cellular immunity is mediated by haemocytes and involves responses including 138 phagocytosis, nodulation and encapsulation [57] While phagocytosis is mediated by pathogen 139 recognition proteins (e.g., peptidoglycan recognition proteins L and S) [58] and transmembrane 140 proteins such as eater [59], nodulation and encapsulation are often accompanied by melanization, 141 a process catalyzed by the pro-phenoloxidase (PPO) and pro-phenoloxidase activator (PPOact) 142 enzymes [52, 60, 61]. 143 144 Different studies have revealed interactions among nutrition, immunity and physiological changes 145 associated with behavioral development. First, nutrition affects the expression of immune genes 146 [62-64] and susceptibility to different pathogens [65-68]. Second, infections of pathogens and 8 171 almost 3X higher when compared with P-UR colonies (100 and 35, respectively; P= <0.0001).",

First, we found highly significant 531 differences between nurses and foragers independently of nutritional condition and age. 532 Nurse/forager expression differences were especially large in younger 2-week old workers. This 533 expression pattern unveils mrjp1 as a reliable biomarker of behavior for whole body analyses. 534 Second, young nurses from pollen-restricted colonies had lower mrjp1 levels compared with 535 pollen-unrestricted colonies (P=0.02), but no significant differences between nutritional groups 536 were found in older nurses. Thus, in contrast with vg, the effect of pollen restriction was limited 537 to younger nurses. Third, foragers showed intriguing changes of mrjp1 expression associated with 538 nutrition and age. Younger 2-week-old foragers from colonies with high pollen storages (P-UR), 539 have higher mrjp1 levels compared with foragers from colonies with low pollen storage (P-R). 549 Still, these results suggest interesting possibilities for future studies. Royal jelly proteins secretion 550 from nurses' hypopharyngeal glands has been primarily associated with larval and queen feeding. 551 However, these proteins also are transferred during trophallaxis -mouth to mouth food transfer -552 preferentially to younger workers [86, 87] . Consistently, our results suggest that foragers could be 553 MRJPs donors during trophallactic interactions and that the potential for these interactions 554 increases with nutrition and age.

Although these studies have revealed the existence of differential tissue-specific 582 responses to nutritional inputs, few tissues and organs have been so far analyzed and it is 583 unknown the contribution of their expression relative to the whole body. Our analysis of ilp1 584 showed that this gene presented behavioral differences in 2-week-old workers from colonies with 585 unrestricted access to pollen, in which foragers had significantly higher levels compared with 586 nurses. Thus, ilp1 expression patterns in the whole-body followed a similar pattern to that 587 reported in isolated brains, but this similarly is restricted to young individuals of colonies not 588 experiencing nutritional stress. The magnitude of the difference between nurses and foragers for 589 the whole body is lower than that observed in brains [29, 30] . This result suggests that in young 590 nurses ilp1 expression is upregulated in other tissues when the colony is not nutritionally stressed. . On the other hand, given the expression differences yet existing between young 595 nurses and foragers from colonies not experiencing pollen deprivation, our results also suggest 596 that under this nutritional condition, ilp1 is predominantly higher expressed in forager's brain 597 compared with other tissues of nurses (e.g., fat body). In addition, nutritional comparison among 598 young foragers indicates that ilp1 expression is reduced by nutritional stress, possibly by 599 inhibiting ilp1 forager's brain expression. In contrast, in older nurses, nutritional stress is 600 associated with increased expression of ilp1. It remains to be addressed the contribution of the 601 brain and other tissues in this response. On the other hand, age comparisons revealed an 602 important age-dependent reduction in its expression in both nutritional conditions. Thus, ilp1 603 follow similar mRNA levels and expression pattern compared to mfe, but with some differences 604 in the strength of the effects of nutrition and age.

However, in our experimental model, the onset of foraging 465 (at 11 days of age) occurred earlier when compared with typical large colonies, which is around 466 18.5 days of age [24]. Nurse to forager transition depends on several variables, including 467 population size, nutritional conditions and colony demography [21]. Thus, for example, in small 468 (1000-1200 bees) single cohort colonies established with 1-day old bees and subject to nutritional 469 stress, foraging can start as early as at 3-4 days of age [26]. The onset of foraging observed in our 470 experimental colonies can be due to the interactions of several variables, including small colony 471 size. 472 473 We determined the effects of pollen restriction on both nectar and pollen foragers. Our results 474 show a higher number of both types of foragers in pollen-restricted colonies (low pollen storage) 475 compared with unrestricted access to pollen (high pollen storage). Interestingly, although pollen 476 restriction induced new nectar and pollen foragers equally, there was a significantly lower 477 number of new pollen foragers compared with nectar foragers in colonies having unrestricted 478 access to pollen. This result is consistent with early studies showing that stored pollen inhibits 479 pollen foraging [69, 70].

Apparently, below this level, a reduced 485 amount of stored pollen is the main factor stimulating pollen foraging.

Effect of pollen restriction on brood production and colony demography 490 In this study, we also showed that there were significantly fewer emerging bees in pollen-491 restricted colonies when compared with pollen-unrestricted colonies. This result is consistent 492 with previous studies showing a correlation between pollen supply and brood area [69, 73]. It has 493 been proposed that precocious foraging has negative consequences for the demographic balance 494 of colonies, as nurses transitioning early to foragers have a reduced lifespan compared with those 495 that have an extended nurse stage [74-76]. Subsequent forager depletion is expected to result in 496 the further behavioral transition of the remaining nurse population, leading to a reduced capacity 497 to sustain brood rearing, that may be intensified by larval cannibalism [74]. Thus, colonies 498 experiencing nutritional stress due to restricted pollen intake are expected to collapse due 499 primarily to the consequences of worker's accelerated behavioral development (precocious 500 foraging) on worker lifespan and brood rearing. Our results, showing precocious foraging and 501 reduced brood production in pollen restricted colonies, suggest that a similar situation may occur 502 in regions where colonies surrounded by intensively cultivated areas store low amounts of pollen 503 [14] 504 505 3.

However, it is interesting to note that the 561 magnitude of this difference is lower in contrast to results obtained by direct comparison of 562 isolated corpora allata from nurses and foragers [89]. This result suggests that mfe expression in 563 other tissues of young nurses reduces the difference in overall body expression. Consist with this 564 possibility, mfe expression has been detected in ovaries of nurses honey bees [84] and JH 565 synthesis have been reported in ovaries of beetles [90] and mosquitoes [91]. An additional report 566 showing higher levels of mfe in abdomens of young nurses compared with young foragers from a 567 non-nutritionally stressed colony, is further consistent with the proposal of that mfe is 568 significantly expressed in other tissues different to the corpora allata, especially in young non-569 nutritionally stressed nurses [80], although still forager's corpora allata is the main organ for JH 570 synthesis. Thus, these results also contribute to challenge the traditional view that the corpora 571 allata is the only source of JH in insects [33, 92, 93].

This 915 modification resulted in colonies with a population of three thousand bees composed 916 predominantly of 2-week-old foragers, 1-week-old nurses, and newly-emerged bees allowing us 917 to uncouple the effects of age and behavior by collecting same-age nurses and foragers at 918 different times. Then, in contrast with the original protocol with colonies headed by non-egg-919 laying queens confined in small cages, we confined egg-laying queens in frame-sized excluder 920 cages. This last modification avoided the necessity of introducing young bees into the colony to 921 prevent delayed behavioral development [114] (Figure S1). 922 923 A set of sixteen TCSC colonies, each with a population of three thousand bees were formed by 924 newly-emerged bees from multiple colonies (approximately 50) and established in four-frame 925 boxes. This experimental design homogenizes the genetic background of the colonies studied:",
