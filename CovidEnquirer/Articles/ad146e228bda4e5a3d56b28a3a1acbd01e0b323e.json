A new previous unknown betacoronavirus was discovered and identified as the etiologic agent of this new pneumonia diagnosed in Wuhan [1] . Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases. The new virus was provisory named 2019-nCoV by World Health Organizzation on 12 January 2020 [2] and sun after the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, formally recognized this virus as a sister to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and designates it as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [3] . The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 due to the global spread has been defined pandemia on March 11, 2020. In Europe Italy is becoming a particularly alarming and interesting place to study the evolution of the epidemic also thanks to the rapid reaction of the Italian Health organizations and the relevant control measure to prevent transmission adopted. Based on Chinese experience and the estimation of transmission rate published by Tang B et al.. [4] . Here we develop models for the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 during the early stages of transmission in Italy; models which may be useful for inference, forecasting or scenario analysis. Despite the fact that epidemic is changing rapidly and our results have been considered preliminary, the models we are using are considered strongly predictive and useful for the interpretation of such an unexpected event in a country like Italy.",

The continuous black curve shows the solution assuming a I(0) = 3 number of infectious individuals at day=0, exactly equivalent to the official detected cases at the same day. No attention is paid to a best fit of the data, also because they are rather sparse, however the quality of the simple (SIR) model is evident also at the first stages of the epidemic. The parameter values sound also reasonable: with a recovering average time T r = 7 days (\u03b3 = 1/T r ) and R 0 = 3.4 and no further corrections: a brilliant example of the predictive force of the SIR model. However Fig. 1 has a more specific aim: showing the rather delicate r\u00f4le played by a possible underestimation of the infectious individual at the early stages of the infection outbreak. In fact one can assumes a different (possible) scenario based on the difficulty of a precise estimation of the initial number of infectious individuals. Such a possible scenario is illustrated by the the full blue curve showing a prediction which results from a misleading estimation of I(0). The effective number of initial infectious is 30 times larger (I(0) = 90), but the curve has been translated to a fictitious\u012a(0) = 3, the reveled number, from the dashed mathematical result. A change in R 0 from R 0 = 3.4 to R 0 = 1.7 would give a reason- able fit of the early stage of the outbreak. The effect is rather well known as discussed in ref. [8] in the case of the epidemic event in China. In that case a proposed exponential fit of the precocious data (January 10th to January 24th) results in a values of R 0 \u2248 3.58 which is reduced to R 0 \u2248 2.24 is the associated initial condition on I(0) is multiplied by an increasing factor from 2 to 8. In Fig. 2 we show the time behavior of the infectious population within the simple SIR model of Eqs. (5)-(7) (T r = 1/\u03b3 = 7 days, R 0 = 3.4) both in logarithmic (upper panel) and linear scale (lower panel). The data are the data of Fig. 1 .",
