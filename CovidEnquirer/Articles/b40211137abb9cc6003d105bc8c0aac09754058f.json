Some organisms are newly recognized pathogens that have existed for centuries (for example, Helicobacter pylori, which causes gastric ulcers). Others are old organisms that have learned new tricks (for example, multidrug-resistant tubercle bacilli). A third category consists of totally new organisms. 1 This last group of alarming new infectious agents that are virulent and deadly have emerged in rapid succession during the last few years. Some of these, such as the Ebola virus infection, 2 are still smoldering in some remote corners of the world, 3 while others, such as the H5N1 (and H7N7) influenza A bird flu virus and the West Nile virus infections, are emerging in different parts of the world. 4 Severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, is the latest addition to this deadly assortment of new diseases. In the face of these infectious threats, in particular the pandemic of HIV infection, the dental community has reacted swiftly by adopting standard precautions. Dentists follow a uniform infection control protocol to treat all patients, irrespective of their medical histories. 5 However, in the face of a new infection that is considered highly contagious, it is prudent to review infection control procedures. The objective of this article, therefore, is to describe the epidemiology, clinical features, etiology and prevention of SARS, as well as to evaluate the current infection control protocols used in dentistry in view of the facts related to the spread of this infection. 6 We also explore the prospects for recrudescence of the disease, its treatment modalities and the promise of a SARS vaccine.",

            "text": "We do not know with certainty how, where and when the disease now known as SARS manifested in humans, although theories abound. In February 2003, the World Health Organization, or WHO, coined the term \"severe acute respiratory syndrome\" for the flulike condition that developed into pneumonia. 7 Nonetheless, researchers and clinicians generally believe that the first few cases may have originated in China. These sporadic cases were described sometime in the fall of 2002 in the Guangdong province in southern China. For decades, the Guangdong province had a large concentration of people, pigs and fowl living in close proximity because of mixed farming traditions that date back for centuries. 1 This region also has the dubious distinction of being the deadly source of the Asian flu, caused by the H2N2 virus, which killed about 1 million people worldwide in 1957 and 1958. 8 In 1997, the avian flu (caused by the H5N1 virus), which killed six people, also originated in the Guangdong province. 9 The recent outbreak. The SARS outbreak has been identified in more than 30 countries in five continents, affecting more than 8,000 people, predominantly in Asia (especially China), with mini-outbreaks in North America and a few cases in Europe. The disease has led to more than 700 deaths worldwide. Clusters of cases are particularly common among close associates of patients and the health care workers who treated them and their household contacts. Because of the alarming global spread of the disease, WHO issued a global alert in March 2003 and instituted worldwide surveillance. 6 Patient characteristics. Most patients identified up to now were previously healthy adults aged 25 through 70 years. 10 A few cases of SARS have been reported among children (\u2264 15 years of age), in whom the clinical course now is thought to be less aggressive. 11 We provide a summary of the major clinical characteristics of patients with SARS, although the information should be considered preliminary because of the broad and nonspecific case definition.",

Headache, malaise and myalgia also are common. At the onset of the illness, some patients have mild respiratory symptoms. In a few cases, the febrile prodrome may be accompanied by diarrhea, although rash and neurologic or gastrointestinal findings are absent. After three to seven days, the secondary lower-respiratory phase begins with a dry, nonproductive cough or dyspnea that may be accompanied by, or progress to, hypoxemia.

However, in the majority of patients, the respiratory phase is characterized by early focal infiltrates that progress to more generalized, patchy, interstitial infiltrates, sometimes leading to consolidation in the very late stages. 13 In general, in the early phase of the disease, patients may have either a normal or decreased white blood cell count, with a reduction in the absolute lymphocyte count.

[16] [17] [18] This phenomenon leads to a classic cytopathic effect in which the confluent cell layers in laboratory cell cultures are broken down, causing patchy denudation and detachment of cells. [16] [17] [18] Immunofluorescence testing of the infected cells indicated that they were indeed infected with a new form of the coronavirus, which has been termed \"SARS coronavirus,\" or SARS-CoV. Furthermore, antibodies to the SARS-CoV were found almost exclusively in patients with SARS during their convalescence, but not in human serum samples from healthy patients or in samples banked before the outbreak, 16 suggesting that the infection is new to humans. Until now, human coronaviruses have caused the relatively innocuous common cold. 20 However, coronaviruses that infect other mammals and birds are more virulent. These include avian infectious bronchitis (a major problem in the poultry industry), transmissible gastroenteritis of pigs and feline infectious peritonitis. 21 Although there was initial speculation that close contact between poultry and humans in the Chinese province of Guangdong (where SARS is thought to have originated) may have resulted in the virus' crossing the species barrier from poultry to humans, evidence now indicates that the Himalayan palm civet cats that are consumed as a delicacy and sold widely in animal markets in China are the source of the infection. 22 However, the SARS-CoV is not a recombinant of known coronaviruses. Analyses of the genetic signatures of the viral strains from different geographic regions indicate that immunological pressure might modulate the evolution of the virus in human population cohorts. 23, 24 Other candidate organisms such as paramyxovirus and chlamydia have been implicated in the disease process, but the consensus is that they play a very small role, if any, in the pathogenesis of SARS. 23 General properties of Coronaviridae.

Interestingly, they also are associated to some extent with human diarrheal diseases. 21 Structurally, they are 80 to 160 nanometers in diameter, positive-stranded and about 30 kilobases in length. 21 Their genome is the largest of all RNA viruses, and highfrequency recombination between related coronaviruses leads to the generation of much genetic diversity. The virus has three major proteins. The nucleocapsid protein is enclosed within the viral envelope with the RNA in a helical nucleocapsid. The other two proteins are the membrane glycoproteins and the spike glycoprotein. 21 The spike glycoprotein is responsible for the characteristic fringe of crownlike projections. Antibodies that elicit spike glycoprotein are thought to confer protection against infection. Because the human strains are relatively difficult to culture compared with animal strains, the extent of strain variation in human coronaviruses is unclear. 25 There are three serologically and genetically distinct groups of coronaviruses associated with animal and human disease. In general, they are species-specific, although there are a number of examples of viruses crossing species barriers and establishing themselves in new hosts. 21, 25 Once the host is infected, the virus may produce localized disease that often is restricted to the respiratory epithelium or the gastrointestinal tract, or they may produce disseminated infection causing systemic disease. 21 Coronavirus was confirmed as the etiologic agent in SARS via serologic techniques demonstrating a rise in antibody titer, its growth in tissue culture, a determination of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, or RT-PCR, specific for this virus using molecular genetic techniques, and animal studies. 23 Animal studies have helped to satisfy Koch's postulates, which are necessary to prove disease causation. 19 These postulates stipulate that to be the causal agent, a pathogen must meet four conditions: it must be found in all cases of the disease, it must be isolated from the host and grown in pure culture, it must reproduce the original disease when introduced into a susceptible host, and it must be found in the experimental host so infected. However, further studies that include control groups are required to determine the role of other agents, if any, in causality or as cofactors for severe disease.",

It is more stable (up to four days) in stool from patients with diarrhea (which has a higher pH than does normal stool). However, the virus loses infectivity five minutes after being exposed to commonly used disinfectants and fixatives, including 10 percent formaldehyde, 10 percent hypochlorite, 75 percent ethanol and 2 percent phenol. Heat at 56 C kills the SARS coronavirus at around 10,000 units per 15 minutes (considered to be a quick reduction). 27 Spread of the disease. The available epidemiologic data suggest strongly that the main routes of virus spread are droplets, direct contact and fomite (indirect contact) transmission, although airborne transmission has not been ruled out completely. 28 Researchers believe that the cause of the large outbreaks among health care workers was the transmission of droplets through aerosol-generating medical procedures, such as the use of nebulizers. 28, 29 No firm data exist regarding the infectivity of contaminated saliva (as opposed to sputum from the respiratory tract) through the droplet route. In some patients, the infection manifests itself as a mild form of diarrhea, and coronavirus particles have been recovered from fecal matter. Hence, it is possible that fecal contamination could lead to the spread of the disease, although more data are needed to confirm this route of transmission. It is interesting that some animal coronaviruses are spread through the fecal-oral route. 21 Laboratory diagnosis. The mainstay of the SARS diagnosis is its characteristic clinical features mentioned above. However, a number of laboratory tests-including serologic tests, cell culture and molecular diagnostics-can be used to confirm the clinically suspicious or probable cases. 16, 23 These tests include the following.",

Patients with SARS need ground emergency medical services. 32 These screening questions should be asked routinely of all patients, because questioning only a select group of patients, for whatever reason, may undermine the early detection of infection and might be construed as a discriminatory practice. Clinicians should delay treating convalescing patients for at least one month after they are released from the hospital. Convalescing patients are instructed to remain at home for seven days after discharge from the hospital, and during this period they are requested to stay indoors and keep contact with others to a minimum. 33 Preprocedural rinsing. A preprocedural antimicrobial mouthrinse (with 0.12 to 0.2 percent chlorhexidine gluconate) is believed to reduce the number of microbes that are released into the operatory environment. This has been shown in a number of studies in which a longlasting mouthrinse (for example, chlorhexidine gluconate with povidone iodine and essential oils) has reduced the disseminated microbial load during procedures such as ultrasonic scaling. 34, 35 However, no concrete data show that a preprocedural mouthrinse reduces infection among dental health care workers or patients. A preprocedural rinse would be most useful in situations in which a rubber dam cannot be used, such as when a prophylaxis cup or an ultrasonic scaler is used, and in the absence of assisted, high-volume suction.",

By contrast, the endogenous residential flora are almost impossible to remove completely, but are less likely to be associated with infections. 36 The single most important method of preventing transmission of any infectious agent, including the SARS coronavirus, is hand washing and appropriate hand care.
