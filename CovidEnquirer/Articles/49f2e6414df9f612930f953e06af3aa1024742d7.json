It was once a major epidemic in South America and puts millions of people in Argentina at risk. Here, we aimed to develop horse antibodies or antibody fragments against JUNV. Before preparing the horse antibodies, a strategy to efficiently generate horse antisera was established based on comparisons among immunogens and immunization methods in both mice and horses. Antisera against JUNV were finally obtained by vaccinating horses with vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotypes bearing JUNV GP. The horse antibodies IgG and F(ab') 2 were subsequently demonstrated to effectively neutralize vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotypes bearing JUNV GP and to show some cross-neutralization against pathogenic New World arenaviruses. Further research revealed that Asp123 on GP1 is an important site for the binding of antibodies targeting mainly JUNV GP1 for neutralization. Collectively, this study presents an efficient strategy to develop horse antisera against JUNV and provides GP1-specific horse antibodies as potential therapeutics for AHF.",

New World (NW) arenaviruses, such as Jun\u00edn virus (JUNV), Machupo virus (MACV), Guanarito virus (GTOV), Sabia virus (SBAV), and Chapare virus (CHAPV), uninterruptedly break out in South American countries, such as Argentina, Bolivia, Venezuela, and Brazil (Gonzalez et al., 2007; McLay et al., 2014; Pontremoli et al., 2018) . They asymptomatically reside in rodents but are highly pathogenic in humans after occasional infection through the skin, respiratory tract or gastrointestinal mucosa (Radoshitzky et al., 2008) . Due to their high fatality rates, as high as 30%, and limited prophylactics or therapeutics, they are identified as biosafety level (BSL) 4 pathogens in most countries, except that JUNV can be handled at BSL 3 lab in certain circumstances (Nunberg and York, 2012) .",

(2016) , vaccine-elicited human mAbs discovered by Clark et al. (2018) , and a series of mouse mAbs identified by our group (Pan et al., 2018) . These mAbs target the envelope glycoprotein complex (GPC) for neutralization, which consists of trimeric noncovalently bound subunits: receptor recognition subunit glycoprotein 1 (GP1), membrane-fusion subunit glycoprotein 2 (GP2), and stable signal peptide (SSP) (Radoshitzky et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2016) . Although one single-domain antibody targeting nucleoprotein was also reported to neutralize Candid#1 in vitro (Linero et al., 2018) , most reported neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) for JUNV were demonstrated to target GP1. In addition to mAbs, polyclonal antibodies also play a role in combating JUNV infection. immunized rabbits have been demonstrated to protect guinea pigs from a lethal JUNV challenge (Golden et al., 2016) . In fact, horse antiserumderived polyclonal antibodies that demonstrated good efficacy against infectious diseases caused by highly pathogenic agents, such as Ebola virus (Wang et al., 2018a; Zheng et al., 2016) , West Nile virus (Cui et al., 2016) , H5N1 influenza virus (Lu et al., 2006) , severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (Lu et al., 2005) , and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Zhao et al., 2017) , have been extensively reported.",

First, GPC genes of JUNV (GenBank: NC_005081.1), MACV (GenBank: NC_005078.1), GTOV (GenBank: NC_005077.1), SBAV (GenBank: U41071.1), and CHAPV (GenBank: NC_010562.1) were synthesized by GenScript Co., Ltd. (Nanjing, China) and then separately inserted into restriction sites of the eukaryotic expression vector pCAGGS to generate pCAGGS-JUNV GPC, pCAGGS-MACV GPC, pCAGGS-GTOV GPC, pCAGGS-SBAV GPC, and pCAGGS-CHAPV GPC, respectively. HEK293T cells seeded in dishes were transfected with the pCAGGS-JUNV GPC plasmid for 24 h and then infected with VSV\u0394G-GFP/VSV G or VSV\u0394G-Rluc/VSV G (Whitt, 2010) (packaged by our laboratory members) for 1 h. Subsequently, the cell supernatant was completely removed, and culture supernatants containing pseudovirus (VSV\u0394G-GFP/JUNV GPC or VSV\u0394G-Rluc/JUNV GPC) were collected after 36 h. VSV pseudotypes bearing MACV, GTOV, SBAV or CHAPV GPs was packaged in the same way as VSV pseudotypes bearing JUNV GP. These pseudoviruses were restricted to a single round of replication, thus enabling them to be handled in a BSL 2 lab.",

Comparison of immunogens in mice. A Sera from each mouse were collected one week after the third vaccination.

Their PVNT 50 s were characterized with VSV\u0394G-Rluc/JUNV GPC on Vero-E6 cells, and the diluted ratios of sera ranged from 1:20 to 1:2560. Titres of 50% and 80% neutralization (NT 50 and NT 80 ) were marked. Fig. 2 . Comparison of immunization strategies in horses. A Six horses were divided into three groups with two horses in each group. Horses #1859 and #1863 were homogenously vaccinated with VSV pseudoviral particles bearing JUNV GP, horses #1871 and #1886 were vaccinated with DNA the first two times and with VSV pseudotypes bearing JUNV GP the last two times, and horses #1887 and #1888 were homogenously vaccinated with DNA. The corresponding amounts of pseudovirus and DNA are listed. B Horses were vaccinated four times in total with a two-week interval. The three groups followed the same immunization schedule. Serum samples were collected one week after each vaccination. C and D Titres of specific antibodies in sera were detected by both cell-based and pseudoviruscaptured ELISAs.

In Fig. 1A , sera from the recombinant GP1, pCAGGS-JUNV GPC, and pseudovirus groups collected after the last vaccination were detected by GP1 protein-captured, cell-based, and pseudovirus-captured ELISAs, respectively. Titres of antigen-specific antibodies from the three groups were all as high as~10 6 , indicating that the three kinds of immunogens employed in our study were able to stimulate a strong antibody response in mice. Variation in nAbs was monitored by a pseudovirus neutralization test (PVNT) after each vaccination. As shown in Fig. 1B , the 50% neutralization titre (PVNT 50 ) of sera from the GP1 group was approximately 40-80 after three vaccinations. However, the PVNT 50 s of sera from the DNA and pseudovirus groups were both as high as~2560 ( Fig. 1C and 1D) , and the PVNT 50 s were obviously elevated by the first boosting and more obviously elevated by the second boosting.

Sera from the six horses after each vaccination were collected for monitoring antigen-specific antibodies by either cellbased ELISA or pseudovirus-captured ELISA. As shown in Fig. 2C , the titres of specific antibodies of sera from horses (#1859, #1863, #1887, and #1888) in groups 1 and 3 markedly increased with the number of vaccinations, while the titres of sera from horses (#1871 and #1886) in group 2 barely changed. Compared with the titres determined by the cell-based ELISA shown in Fig. 2C , the titres of specific antibodies detected by the pseudovirus-captured ELISA shown in Fig. 2D were different. In which, only titres of specific antibodies of sera from group 1 (#1859 and #1863) were remarkably elevated by boosting, while those from other horses remained unchanged. These results demonstrated that either homogenous vaccination with pseudovirus or DNA could effectively stimulate antigen-specific antibodies in horses, while the combined vaccination with DNA and pseudovirus could not achieve the desired goal. Additionally, antibodies triggered by pseudovirus could recognize not only GPC displayed on the virus but also GPC expressed on the cell surface.",

A Sera from horses #1859 and #1863 were collected after immunization, and their neutralization (%) on JUNV was characterized with VSV\u0394G-Rluc/JUNV GPC; the dilution ratios of sera ranged from 1:20 to 1:5120. B The neutralization of sera was characterized with VSV\u0394G-GFP/JUNV GPC, and the dilution ratios of sera are indicated in the figure. Images were captured 24 h after infection. Data are from a representative experiment. C The neutralization (%) of mixed sera from horses #1859 and #1863 against the five pathogenic NW arenaviruses was characterized with VSV pseudotypes bearing JUNV, MACV, GTOV, SBAV, and CHAPV GPs, respectively. The dilution ratios in each group ranged from 1:20 to 1:5120. NT 50 and NT 80 were marked. X. Pan, et al. Antiviral Research 174 (2020) 104666 specific IgG and F(ab') 2 were prepared as described in detail in the Methods section. GP1-specific IgG and GP1-specific F(ab') 2 were yielded one fiftieth of total IgG and total F(ab') 2 , respectively, through affinity chromatography against eukaryotic GP1. IgG and F(ab') 2 were detected by both nonreducing and reducing SDS-PAGE, and their actual sizes were consistent with the theoretical sizes, as shown in Fig. 4A . After a set of PVNTs, the 50% and 80% inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 and IC 80 ) of these antibodies were obtained. As presented in Fig. 4B , the IC 50 values of total IgG and total F(ab') 2 were 13.9 and 7.7 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. GP1-specific IgG and GP1-specific F(ab') 2 had lower IC 50 s than total IgG and total F(ab') 2 , which were 0.8 and 2.0 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. Additionally, the IC 80 s of total IgG, total F(ab') 2 , GP1-specific IgG, and GP1-specific F(ab') 2 were 72.1, 27.6, 3.5, and 9.5 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. Furthermore, residual IgG collected from the flow-through fractions of GP1-affinity chromatography hardly neutralized VSV pseudotypes bearing JUNV GP even at a concentration of 100 \u03bcg/ml. These results collectively demonstrated that purification against GP1 could significantly enrich nAbs from total IgG and F(ab') 2 and, in turn, confirmed GP1 as an important target of nAbs in sera prepared in our study. We further verified the neutralization abilities of the antibodies with recombinant VSV expressing JUNV GP. rVSV\u0394G-eGFP/JUNV GPC permanently carrying eGFP as a reporter was recombined by replacing VSV G with JUNV GPC, which could form fluorescent plaques on Vero-E6 cells, thus avoiding handling live JUNV in a BSL 4 laboratory. As shown in Fig. 4C , either GP1-specific IgG and GP1-specific F(ab') 2 or total IgG and total F(ab') 2 obviously reduced GFP-positive plaques on Vero-E6 cells at 1-fold IC 50 . The reduction in GFP-positive plaques was more significant when antibodies were given at 2-fold IC 50 . The results in Fig. 4C from tests with recombinant virus were similar to those from tests with the pseudovirus shown in Fig. 4B .",

In Fig. 6A , the fifth peptide (GP1 121-135 AA) was most strongly bound by GP1-specific antibodies among the sixteen peptides; GP1 was used as a positive control. In comparison, residual IgG weakly bound to these peptides, reflecting little nonspecific binding. In fact, P5 overlapped with the neutralizing epitopes of GD01 reported by Mahmutovic et al. (2015) and with those of eOD01 reported by Zeltina et al. (2017) at Y122 and D123 on GP1 (Fig. 6B) . To verify the importance of Y122 and D123 to neutralization with the GP1-specific antibodies prepared in our study, we employed both mutated peptides and GP1s as antigens in another two sets of ELISAs. As a result, mutations at Y122A, D123A, and both sites on P5 partially abolished the binding of antibodies to similar degrees (Fig. 6C) . We further validated this result with recombinant GP1, and mutation at D123A and mutations at Y122A&D123A impaired the binding to GP1, while mutation at only Y122A did not (Fig. 6D) . Thus, we speculated that Asp123 on P5 is an important site on GP1 for the binding of these GP1-specific nAbs.",

However, reported nAbs rarely possess crossneutralization against them. MAbs targeting sequence-conserved GP2 are considered very promising, while antibodies that cross-react with both NW and Old World arenaviruses neutralize neither (Amanat et al., 2018) . NAbs for JUNV simply targeting GP1 have not been reported to have cross-neutralization capabilities against the five arenaviruses except for one elicited by Candid#1 that neutralizes both JUNV and MACV with varying efficiency in vitro (Clark et al., 2018) .",

In our study, both antisera and JUNV GP1-specific IgG purified from antisera had some cross-neutralizing effect on the five NW clade B arenaviruses, although the results were only validated with VSV pseudotypes bearing arenaviral GPs, which may be different from those validated with actual viruses. Beyond that, the exact cross-neutralizing mechanism is not clear. As one clue, antisera produced by vaccinating horses with pseudovirus Fig. 5 . Affinity of IgG and F(ab') 2 for JUNV GP1. Data were collected by BLI, and the kinetics (K on and K off ) were processed by an Octet data analysis system. The binding curves were obtained by passing total IgG, total F(ab') 2 , GP1-specific IgG and GP1-specific F(ab') 2 at different concentrations over biotinylated recombinant GP1 immobilized on a streptavidin biosensor surface. The kinetics values (K d , M) were calculated by deducting from baseline 2 and fitting the association and dissociation responses to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model. Data are from one strict experiment. expressing GPC reacted with not only pseudovirus-expressed GPC but also with cell-expressed GPC. This result implies that antisera and JUNV GP1-specific IgG purified from antisera might target diversiform or flexible structures of GPC to work, thus escaping hinderance from tiny structural differences among the five viruses. Another clue may be that they bound the key site Asp123 on GP1, which is conserved across the five NW arenaviruses. Even so, studies on cross-nAbs for pathogenic NW arenaviruses are at an early stage and require further validation or exploration. Additionally, cross-neutralization against the five NW pathogenic arenaviruses remains a major challenge, and more attention should be paid to their structural similarities rather than their sequence similarities.",

The removal of Fc from IgG enables horse F(ab') 2 to be an acceptable immune therapeutic with reduced side effects for complex and intractable diseases, especially snakebites and highly pathogenic infectious diseases (Guidolin et al., 2016; Ratanabanangkoon et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018a) . Even so, some disadvantages limit the wide application of horse F(ab') 2 . As a fragment of full-length IgG, horse F(ab') 2 cannot function through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity and crystallisable receptor-mediated cross-presentation, which are contributed by Fc and are considered important in protection in vivo (Chung et al., 2006; Mehlhop et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2017) . As a heterologous protein to human immune system, horse F(ab') 2 may be susceptible to immune resistance, thus a large therapeutic dose should be administered when applied in clinic. However, horse antibodies advantageously have a multitarget mode of action, which differs from that of mAbs. Moreover, multitarget actions affect not only multiple epitopes of the same pathogen but also multiple epitopes of different pathogens, thus providing an irreplaceable advantage for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. Despite of those, the horse F(ab') 2 developed in our study, as a potential therapeutic under study, provides another possibility for AHF therapy.",

This finding provides a good immunogen for preparing horse antiserum against JUNV. In addition, the eukaryotic expression vector inserted with the full-length GPC gene, which was vaccinated through electroporation to realize expression in situ, exhibited a capacity to stimulate nAbs similar to that of the pseudoviral particle in mice. DNA immunization has been confirmed to be a good way to stimulate antibodies in mice and guinea pigs by both our group (Pan et al., 2018) and by Golden et al. (Golden et al. (2016) . However, DNA immunization in horses did not exhibit the same efficacy as that in mice according to our results. We vaccinated horses through multipoint injection with aluminium phosphate as an adjuvant while employing electroporation to vaccinate mice without adjuvant. Hence, we speculate that electroporation is a necessary means for using DNA immunization to stimulate the antibody response in horses. This conclusion is also confirmed by other reports (Grunwald and Ulbert, 2015; Saade and Petrovsky, 2012) .",

            "text": "It is worth mentioning that the affinity chromatography method against GP1 employed in our study substantially enriched the neutralizing activities of the horse antibodies. Specifically, the neutralizing activity of GP1-specific IgG (IC 50 = 0.8 \u03bcg/ml) was almost 17 fold higher than that of total IgG (IC 50 = 13.9 \u03bcg/ml). Hence, we deem GP1 to be an important target of nAbs in horse antisera despite that the immunogen employed by our study possessed full-length GPC. Through peptide epitope mapping, we found that P121-135 was strongly bound by GP1-specific IgG and that Asp123 on GP1 was an important site for antibody binding. Even though P121-135 shows significant binding, there can be other potential highly reactive epitopes in GP1 which are not presented in the peptide mapping scheme. These findings further proved that GP1, as a receptor recognition subunit, is a pivotal target of Fig. 6 . Key site bound by GP1-specific antibodies. A The binding of GP1-specific IgG to sixteen peptides derived from JUNV GP1 was detected by a peptide ELISA. GP1 was used as a positive control, and a residual IgG group and PBS group were used as controls to exclude nonspecific binding. B Footprints of GD01 and eOD01 on JUNV GP1 are coloured magenta and green, respectively. Tyr122 and Asp123 are shown as sticks and marked in red. The structure data were processed with PyMOL 2.0. C and D The binding of GP1-specific IgG to wild-type (WT) P5 and mutated P5s (Tyr122 to Ala, Asp123 to Ala, or both sites) was detected as described in A. The binding of GP1-specific IgG to WT GP1 and mutated GP1s (Tyr122 to Ala, Asp123 to Ala, or both sites) was detected by recombinant GP1-captured ELISA. **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 vs. control (WT); ns, not significant. nAbs for JUNV. Despite that, antibodies targeting GP2 or GP1/GP2 interface may also exist in the horse antisera prepared by our study. Actually, antibodies targeting GP1/GP2 interface for blocking structural rearrangements that are required for fusion, have been demonstrated effectively neutralize Lassa virus (Yu et al., 2016) . Thus antibodies in horse antisera targeting more epitopes are worth to be further studied.",
