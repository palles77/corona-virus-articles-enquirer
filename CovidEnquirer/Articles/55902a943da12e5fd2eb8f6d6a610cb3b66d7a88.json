As an alternative to parenteral Thymopentin Nasal delivery Pharmacokinetics Toxicity of nasal cilia Immunomodulating effect T-lymphocyte subsets a b s t r a c t Thymopentin (TP 5), a synthetic pentapeptide, has been used in clinic as a modulator for immnuodeficiencies through intramuscular administration. The objectives of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics using normal rats and toxicity of nasal cilia as well as immunomodulating effects using immunosuppression rats after intranasal delivery of thymopentin with or without an absorption enhancer. The absorption extent of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled TP 5 via nasal delivery at a single dose is significantly improved by incorporating sodium deoxycholate, Brij 35 and chitosan, respectively. FITC-TP 5 can also be absorbed to such an extent ranging from 15 to 28% after intranasal administration of FITC-TP 5 alone, FITC-TP 5 with sodium caprylate, or with bacitracin, respectively. After seven consecutive days multiple dosing, TP 5 formulation with sodium deoxycholate or Brij 35 caused apparently injury to nasal cilia, indicating these two enhancers would not be appropriate for nasal delivery. Results from superoxide dismutase activity, maleic dialdehyde, T-lymphocyte subsets (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ and CD4+/CD8+ ratio) analyses suggest that all the selected enhancers improve the modulating effects of TP 5 in the immunosuppression rats. On an overall evaluation, intranasal TP 5 alone, TP 5 with chitosan, or TP 5 with bacitracin formulation may be suitable for the future clinical application.",

Peroral dosing, the most common route of application for the systemic delivery of drugs, is limited for most peptides due to extensive metabolism and poor mucosal permeability [20] . Nasal drug delivery has been proposed as the most feasible alternative to parenteral injections due to the high permeability of the nasal epithelium, the avoidance of first-pass metabolism and a convenient administration route. A number of peptide and protein drugs restricted to oral administrations have been intensively investigated for systemic medication through nasal administrations [39] .

Among the approaches explored so far in order to optimize the transport of the peptide molecules across mucosal barriers, the use of penetration enhancers or mucosal enzyme inhibitor represents a challenging but promising strategy. Therefore, the several TP 5 preparations for intranasal administrations were formulated by incorporating the five absorption enhancers, including sodium deoxycholate (SDch), sodium carprylate (SCa), polyoxyethylene lauryl ether (Brij 35), chitosan and bacitracin, respectively. Furthermore, TP 5 solution was administered intravenously and intranasally for evaluation of the effect of nasal delivery.",

The test principle is as follows: superoxide anions (O 2 \u00c0 ) are generated by a xanthine oxidase (XOD) system and oxidize hydroxylamine forming the product of nitrite. This product is stained with the kit reagent, thereby showing purple color. Absorbance of the stained solution is assayed at 550 nm using a spectrophotometer (752type, Shanghai, China). When SOD is present in the sample, superoxide anion concentration is lowered through specific inhibition, thus lowering the colorimetric signal. Consequently, SOD activity is obtained after calculation. For each assay, a volume of 15 ml plasma sample was used. All the processing and assay validation met the requirements of the kit instruction. One unit of SOD activity is defined as that amount of enzyme required to inhibit the reduction of SOD by 50% under the specified conditions. Plasma maleic dialdehyde (MDA) level was measured according to the MDA kit instruction. The assay principle is as follows: maleic dialdehyde, a secondary product of lipid peroxidation, reacts with thiobarbituric acid (TBA) in acidic medium to give a pink colored pigment at 95 8C. The absorbance of pink color is read at 532 nm using the spectrophotometer as above. For each assay, a volume of 100 ml plasma sample was used.

Previous study showed that the pentapeptide was rapidly degraded in plasma [36] , and degraded in vitro by human lymphocytes into two main fragments; the tetrapeptide (TP 4, thymocartin) Lys-Asp-Val-Tyr and the tripeptide (TP 3, thymotrinan) Asp-Val-Tyr [2] . The degradation products, both TP4 and TP3, are shown to exert similar immunomodulatory activities to TP5 affecting both humoral and cellular responses [13, 27] . The pharmacokinetics of thymopentin has not been characterized due to the difficulty for measuring the blood concentrations using TP 5 itself. Consequently, FITC labeled TP 5 was used for pharmacokinetic analysis in the present investigation. Absolute bioavailability represents the absorption extent of a drug. Our pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that three penetration enhancers including sodium deoxycholate (SDch), polyoxyethylene lauryl ether (Brij 35), and chitosan significantly improve the absorption extent of FITC-TP 5 via nasal mucosa. Sodium deoxycholate was thought as a potential absorption enhancer for drug delivery [21] , and the enhanced absorption of FITC-TP 5 by sodium deoxycholate may be caused by the interaction mechanism that bile sodium was reported to able to disrupt lipid bilayers by intercalating between the phospholipids and forming mixed micelles [40, 41] . The nasal promoting effect of Brij 35 may be related to the changed mucosal permeability [15] . Chitosan is a cationic polysaccharide widely employed as an absorption enhancer [19, 12] . The ability of chitosan to work as an absorption enhancer was proven on Caco-2 cells, which serve as a model of intestinal epithelium [4, 8, 14, 31] , as well as in 'in vitro' experiments on nasal and buccal mucosae of animals [25, 30] . The enhanced drug absorption by chitosan may be derived from the effect of calcium on adherent junctions rather than direct effect on tight junctions [19] while calcium ions are essential for the cells to maintain intercellular contacts. The removal of extracellular calcium in cultured epithelial cell lines or in vivo mucosae may result in the opening of tight junctions and prevent the formation of new tight junctions. This mechanism may be also true for the FITC-TP 5.",

Previous studies demonstrated that the absorption promoting effect of sodium caprylate on insulin was in part associated with the chelating ability for calcium ions and the inhibitory action on leucine aminopeptidase activity [24] . In the present study, the immunomodulating activity of FITC labeled TP 5 was remained as the same as that of TP 5 (data from Chinese Peptide Company). Therefore, the increased absorption of FITC-TP 5 by sodium caprylate may be associated with the similar mechanism. Bacitracin is a protease inhibitor, which was proven to be more compatible with nasal cilia [28] . Incorporating bacitracin into a nasal formulation may be beneficial for the absorption of FITC-TP 5 due to the inhibition of TP 5 degradation by the proteases. The present results indicate that the absorption of FITC-TP 5 is slight increased as compared with the blank control (in absence of any enhancer) although it does not reach such an extent as expected. Among the five enhancers, Brij 35 seems to be the most significant factor for enhancing the absorption.",

The lymphatic drainage from the local nasal mucosa and NALT drains into the cervical lymph nodes and then to the systemic lymphatic system. Furthermore, peptides administered intranasally rapidly reach the brain through multiple pathways, consisting of olfactory neuronal, extraneuronal olfactory epithelial, trigeminal nerve and neuronal pathways [22, 35] . Previous investigation showed that the intranasal administration of interferon (IFN) beta-1b led to a significant delivery throughout the rat central nervous system (CNS) and cervical lymph nodes, but a relatively low delivery to peripheral organs [29] . Therefore, intranasally administered peptides such as thymopentin are very likely to end up in the central nervous system. This can be good or bad. For treating multiple sclerosis (MS), intranasal administration of IFN beta-1b may offer a noninvasive approach and produces beneficial effects of tyrosine phosphorylation of IFN receptor in the CNS. For exerting immunomodulating effect, however, TP 5 targeted to the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue may be more beneficial because the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT), a mucosal inductive site for the upper respiratory tract, is important for the development of mucosal immunity. In the present study, the measured FITC-TP 5 after administration via nasal cavity is most likely absorbed through the pathway of the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT). However, it is unclear that how much amount of TP 5 was delivered to the brain and what will happen after the TP 5 reaching the CNS. Thus these issues deserve further investigations.",

The times to reach peak concentrations varied from 30 to 90 min.The pharmacokinetic parameters using non-compartmental analysis are presented inTable 1. In the presence of SDch, Brij 35, chitosan, or chitosan plus bacitracin, the C max and AUC 0-6 h , after i.n. administrations were significantly increased as compared with those of i.n. control group, respectively. For the i.n. administration in the presence of SCa, or bacitracin, these parameters were slightly increased, respectively. The rank order for the AUC 0-6 h values among groups was as follows:6.06 AE 1.72 mg h/ml for Brij 35 > 3.52 AE 0.94 mg h/ml for chitosan plus bacitracin ! 3.50 AE 1.14 mg h/ml for chitosan > 3.38 AE 0.66 mg h/ml for SDch > 2.12 AE 0.30 mg h/ml for SCa > 1.87 AE 0.34 mg h/ml for bacitracin > 1.14 AE 0.31 for FITC-TP 5 alone (i.n. control). The values of T max ranged from 0.65 AE 0.22 h for SCa to 1.55 AE 0.51 for the i.n. control. When compared with the iv administration group, the values of MRT after i.n. administrations with various formulations were significantly extended while those among groups after i.n. administrations were similar. The absolute bioavailability values (F) after i.n. administration of various formulations were as follows: 79.74 AE 0.17% for Brij 35 > 46.32 AE 0.09% for chitosan plus bacitracin ! 46.05 AE 0.11% for chitosan > 44.47 AE 0.07 for SDch > 27.89 AE 0.03 for SCa > 24.61 AE 0.03 for bacitracin > 15.0 AE 0.03% for i.n. control.
