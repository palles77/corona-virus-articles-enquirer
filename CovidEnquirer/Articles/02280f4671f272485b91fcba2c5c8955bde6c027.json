Many quality improvement efforts focus on designating centers of excellence; however, unless patients are directed to these centers, there may be no population health benefits. 19 . 20 Even in mature trauma systems, getting patients to designated trauma centers is a persistent problem. 21 \u2022 22 Critical Care Patients Are Transferred Frequently, But We Know Little About These Transfers Although formal systems transfer trauma and neonatal patients, no such formal system exists for most critically ill patients. Nonetheless, transfers between hospitals are common. In recent data from an allpayer multicenter cohort of critically ill patients, 6 .4% of patients in the ICU were admitted directly from another acute care hospital. 23 However, little is known about how and why these transfers occur or whether patients systematically move toward sites that provide better care. Patient transfers between two hospitals are known to be generally safe. 24 -26 The current system of interhospital critical care transfers is informal, but it is not random. Most hospitals transfer to only a subset of other nearby hospitals. Network analysis provides an approach for examining and improving these patterns and testing whether they achieve the same goals as formal regionalization. Bureaucratic regionalization can be seen as one of several possible approaches to optimizing the flow of patients between hospitals. The remainder of this article introduces these emerging scientific methods and suggests their usefulness for improving the critical care transfer system.",

Hospital B is dependent on the census and capacity of hospital C in a way that is not readily transparent. In some areas patients are frequently refused admission to an leu because of a lack of available beds. 35 This, in part, may be due to poor understanding of the existing transfer system, further hampered by the lack of data distinguishing transfer for capacity from transfers for additionalexpertise or technology. A management perspective that considers the informally integrated network may allow better prevention of congestion and bed lock Regionalization: Trauma networks were able to improve outcomes by combining improved care at central sites with increased flow of patients to those sites. The goals of regionalization in other areas of critical care are the same. The data from Connecticut suggest that cardiac patients are already being directed to sites that provide improved care. Ifthis findingis true more generally, then the goals of regionalization might be met without a large reorganization of the current system. Instead, research and policy can focus on increasing the flow of patients over the current network.",

            "text": "Disaster Preparedness: Recent experience with natural and manmade disasters has made it clear that local resources are the first line of response. As local hospitals are overwhelmed, they will rely on regional referral sites to accept patients. Network science allows a better understanding of these existing lines of transfer and suggests flexibility if the traditional transfer lines are disrupted. A large hospital might not only be disabled from accepting patients (as we modeled) but need to send patients out when incapacitated. Planners could simulate the consequences of removing a central node from the system, anticipating any number of disaster scenarios; integration of network analysis with agent-based models may be of great value here. 36 In cases of actual emergency, hospitals could quicklytriage patients along existing transfer lines and identify new transfer lines when existing ones are broken. In the case of a flu epidemic or another outbreak of SARS, visualization of the network can identify at-risk areas and help contain an outbreak by minimizing transfers to unaffected regions.. CONCLUSION One in five Americans will die in an ICU,37 and critical care expenditures account for 0.5% of the gross domestic product. 8 As the population ages and demand for critical care rises, it will be essential to use existing resources effectively. Wide variation in the processes and outcomes of critical care between hospitals means that thousands of lives and millions of dollars may be saved by getting critically ill patients to more effective hospitals along existing transfer lines. Network analytic techniques offer the potential to improve the efficiency of the current transfer network, informing hospitals on the optimal distribution of patients within regions, and providing a direct way to improve the quality of care for the critically ill. Network analysis can also provide novel information about hospital quality and aid policy makers in understanding the effects of network stressors such as epidemics and disasters.",
