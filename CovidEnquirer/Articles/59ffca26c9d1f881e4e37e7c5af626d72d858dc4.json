The genomic sequence relationship of SARS-CoV with 30 different singlestranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses of various families was studied using two non-standard approaches. Both approaches began with the vectorial profiling of the tetra-nucleotide usage pattern V for each virus. In approach one, a distance measure of a vector V, based on correlation coefficient was devised to construct a relationship tree by the neighbor-joining algorithm. In approach two, a multivariate factor analysis was performed to derive the embedded tetra-nucleotide usage patterns. These patterns were subsequently used to classify the selected viruses.",

In particular, CoronaViruses are prone to recombination [6, 7] and like all other viruses they mutate at a high frequency [8] . This makes extremely hazardous to try to trace the origin of the virus. Nevertheless, this prompted us to investigate their relationships using the RNA word usage hoping to identify some RNA viruses that display similar word usage pattern. Such RNA viruses might hint about the origin of SARS-CoV. This study will contribute to our understanding of the RNA word usage of SARS-CoV and some other pathogenic RNA viruses. In the present study, we explored the relationships of 31 RNA viruses, which are known to cause diseases to their corresponding hosts with either similar symptoms or infectiousness, including SARS-CoV, based on their global tetra-nucleotide usage pattern.",

The overall gene order for this novel pathogen supported its placement in the family of Coronaviridae which includes the animal/human CoronaViruses. It should be emphasized that the sequence similarity shown is attributed mainly to the large RNAdependent RNA polymerase (replication enzyme or RdRp) residing in the first two open reading frames (ORFs). These two ORFs constitute more than 65% (>20 kb) of the total genome size and these regions are more conserved in their nucleotide sequences due to their specialized role for viral RNA replication. Therefore, the possible relationship based on the sequence of the replication enzyme alone was also investigated. Table 1 presents the breakdown of the RNA sequence into mononucleotide frequencies for the 31 viral genomes in our dataset. Except for the Rabbit Hemorrhagic disease Virus (RHV) that shows a fair usage of the four nucleotides in approximately equal number, the other RNA viruses have a biased genome composition. Bovine CoronaVirus (BCoV) and Human CoronaVirus 229E (HCoV) favor the U nucleotide (35.5% and 34.6%) at the expense of the C nucleotide (15.3% and 16.7%). Relatively strong nucleotide biases are visible in the other genomes and we will mention a few of the extremes. The highest base count is 28.4% G in the Yellow Fever Virus (YFV), 38.9% A in the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), 35.5% U in the Bovine CoronaVirus (BCoV) and 28 .5% C count in the Foot-and-Mouth disease Virus (FMV). The lowest base counts are 15.8% G in the Human Respiratory syncytial Virus (HRV), 21 .2% A in the Equine arteritis Virus (EV1), 20.9% U in the Igbo Ora Virus (IOV) and 13.6% C in the Bovine ephemeral Fever Virus (BFV). The A nucleotide is the most popular base among RNA viruses (ranging from 21.2% to 38.9%), and C is the most variable nucleotide (ranging from 13.6% to 33.1%).",

A remarkable deviation from the expected frequencies occurs for the di-nucleotide pairs CpG and UpA (suppression or under-representation, z < -50) as well as di-nucleotides pairs CpA and UpG (enhancement or over-representation, z > 40). These dinucleotide biases, together with mono-nucleotide bias [13] , have a direct impact on the codon usage of viruses.

It is however unlikely that the mechanism of deamination that alters the genetic contents at the DNA level would affect the viral RNA content of most RNA viruses without a DNA stage. There might exist specific cytosine RNA methylases that could be responsible for this effect [16] . However it is more consistent to propose that, unlike the mechanism of cytosine deamination in the DNA realm, the dominating process is cytosine deamination in RNA viruses, converting cytosine to uracil (C \u2666 U) instead of thymine (T). As a consequence of this mechanism, di-nucleotide CpG changes to either di-nucleotide UpG or CpA in the direct/ complementary strands of RNA viruses and causes the over-representation in di-nucleotide UpG and CpA (z > 19) . Interestingly, there is experimental evidence in vitro that the rate of cytosine deamination is faster (>100 times) in the single stranded than in double-stranded state [17] . Apart from the under-representation in dinucleotide CpG and over-representation in di-nucleotide CpA and UpG, the reason for the observed di-nucleotide UpA scarcity in RNA may be explained by its chemical lability [18] . The UpA dinucleotide is chemically the most unstable among the 16 dinucleotides. Furthermore, UpA The information about 31 RNA viruses being investigated in this study.

The two distance trees can be clustered distinctly into two major groups of viruses. Interestingly, this clustering validates our approach, since these clusters are consistent with biological properties of the viruses: Group #1 corresponds to all positive strand ssRNA viruses while Group #2 corresponds to negative strand ssRNA viruses. Each group must undergo different evolutionary paths which lead to their distinct pattern in tetra-nucleotide usage.

Therefore, in order to evaluate the true bias of word size m, it is required to compare the frequencies of word usage in the original sequence to that of model chromosomes that take into account the biases of word size m -1, m -2 ... 1. These model chromosomes were generated by obeying the Markov model of the order (m -1) th . This can be achieved by shuffling m -1 viral nucleotides as one whole unit so that the nucleotide successions up to order (m -1) th were being preserved. Several statistical approaches have been proposed for quantifying word biases [27, 28] . In this study, we employed the z statistics (Equation 1) for dinucleotide and tetra-nucleotide biases [27, 28] . The z value is a measure of the bias of a word, with values close to zero meaning no bias, negative values meaning under-representation and positive values meaning over-representation of the word w in the RNA text.",

The magnitude of r is always between -1 and +1 and the relationship between the two variables will approach perfect linearity as the magnitude of correlation coefficient approaches to extreme values (+/ -1).

Pair-wise distance between two viral genomes is measured by the value of (1 -r). Each row/column corresponds to a specific virus and an entry at the intersection of row X and column Y corresponds to the distance between virus X and virus Y. Such matrix has a diagonal entry of value 0. For the purpose of constructing a relationship tree, only the lower/upper triangular matrix of M is required. After obtaining lower/upper trian-gular matrix of M, the neighbor-joining method (NJ) algorithm was used to construct the relationship tree (Figure 1) . The neighbor-joining method is based on minimum-distance principle. Details of the NJ algorithm are available in [29] .",

It seeks to discover if the observed usage patterns can be explained in terms of a much smaller number of un-correlated pattern sets called factors (eigen-vectors). Suppose we take a simple case where there are 31 viruses each represented by two components (x,y) in vector V (x,y represent the frequencies of occurrence for two specific tetra-nucleotides). Then, in a scatter-plot we can think of the regression line as the original X-axis, rotated so that it approximates the regression line. This type of rotation maximize the variance of the variables (x,y) on the eigen-vector. The remaining variability around this the first eigen-vector was captured in the subsequent eigen-vectors. In this manner, consecutive eigen-vectors are extracted but with a diminishing importance. What each eigen-vector represents is the embedded RNA word usage patterns communalised by a group of viruses presumably under the same selection pressures.",

This placement is consistent with the findings from two seminal papers[9,10] where the SARS-CoV was classified in a separate group from the rest of the known CoronaViruses. In addition, both distance trees suggested that the Bovine CoronaVirus(BCoV) and the Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) should be grouped together whereas the Human CoronaVirus 229E (HCoV) is the closest to the Porcine epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PDV). For the family of negative strand ssRNA viruses, there are two obvious classes that have evolved through different branches of word usage pattern. The first class covers Hantaan Virus (HV1), Reston Ebola Virus (REV), Bovine Ephemeral Fever Virus (BFV), Bovine Respiratory syncytial Virus (BRV), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and Human Respiratory syncytial Virus (HRV).
