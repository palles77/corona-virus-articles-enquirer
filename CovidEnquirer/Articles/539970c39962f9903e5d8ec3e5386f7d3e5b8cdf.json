Source of preweuning morbidity and growth data (previous trial) One hundred and fifty Holstein-Friesian heifer calves, assessed as clinically healthy (i.e. calves that breathed, walked and nursed normally) had been enrolled in a clinical trial which lasted from birth to weaning at lo-12 weeks of age on a dairy milking 5000 cows in the Central Valley of California (Jamaluddin, 1995) . The dairy was organized into five smaller dairies, four of which were about 1.5 km from each other; the fifth was located about 4 km from the others. Calves in this study originated from all five dairies and were raised at one site. Seventy-five of the calves in the previous trial were assigned to the treatment group (based on the dam's eartag number) and fed 2-4 1 of pasteurized colostrum (obtained by pooling colostrum from all five dairies) within 2-3 h after birth, followed by pasteurized waste milk at 4 1 day-' until weaning. Waste milk originated from cows with mastitis or other disorders, and treated with antibiotics. The other 75 calves were assigned to the control group and were fed the same quantities but of nonpasteurized, pooled colostrum and nonpasteurized waste milk. Daily, colostrum and waste milk from all five dairies were taken to a pasteurization site, pooled, and later divided into quantities to be fed either pasteurized or nonpasteurized. Calves were housed individually in hutches and identified by an eartag. Calves were run concurrently; treated and control calves were placed in separate, adjacent rows of hutches on the same premises. Grain feeding consisted of calf-starter pellets (crude protein (CP), 22% dry matter (DM) basis; crude fat, 2.5% DM basis; crude fiber, 8% DM basis) and water ad libitum from the third day after birth until weaning. Age at occurrence, severity., and duration of each episode of diarrhea and respiratory signs were recorded daily afi:er feeding by a trained worker supervised by the senior author, from birth to weaning. For calves with an episode of diarrhea or respiratory disease signs, recurrence of signs after 2 consecutive sign-free days was considered a new episode. Calf weight measured by a trained worker was estimated at birth and once every week until weaning using a heart-girth tape (Nasco Agricultural Science, Modesto, CA). The evaluator was not blinded regarding treatment group.",

Postweaning weights of calves were compared between the treatment groups, simultaneously controlling for age, birth weight, and number of days calves experienced diarrhea and pneumonia during the preweaning period using a time series cross section regression (PROC TSCSREG) (Statistical Analysis Systems Institute Inc., 1993). Diarrhea was defined as watery or loose, unformed feces excreted in voluminous amounts. Severity was scored as 0 for no diarrhea, 1 for mild, 2 for moderate and 3 for severe diarrhea. Pneumonia was defined as the presence of respiratory signs such as coughing or dyspnea requiring treatment, and was scored in the same manner as diarrhea. Evidence of interaction between treatment and postweaning weight versus age was also examined, the presence of which indicated that postweaning weight gain pattern differed between the treatment groups. The Da Silva model was used to accommodate the structure of random error arising from correlated weight data. This model used a variance component and moving average method that took into account the varying effect of weight between animals for a particular age of weighing. The parameters were estimated using two-stage generalized least square regression (PROC TSCSREG) (Statistical Analysis Systems Institute Inc., 1993).",

We were not able to demonstrate compensatory growth in calves fed nonpasteurized colostrum and nonpasteurized milk before weaning, during the period between weaning and approximately 180 days of age. This was despite the fact that the calves appeared healthy and their diet seemed nutritionally adequate. At about 3 months after weaning, significantly higher postweaning weight was observed for calves fed pasteurized milk compared with those fed nonpasteurized milk, after adjusting for potential confounding factors, effect modifiers, and multiple observations from the same calf. Our results provide evidence that the benefit of feeding milk with lower bacterial count to calves persisted for a period of at least 3 months after weaning.",

In the preweaning trial (Jamaluddin, 1995) , calves fed pasteurized colostrum and milk had onset of diarrhea 1 day later, experienced 1 day less of diarrhea in the preweaning period, and suffered less severe diarrhea than calves fed nonpasteurized milk and colostrum. Calves fed pasteurized colostrum and pasteurized waste milk may have had a healthier gut environment during the preweaning period and at weaning and hence experienced reduced morbidity and better weight gain than those fed nonpasteurized colostrum and nonpasteurized milk. This is in line with studies in children which demonstrated that gut flora with predominantly Lmtobacillus and S?r-prococcus species were associated with less gastrointestinal disease (Coates, 1980; Speck, 1983 ) than gut flora with predominantly Escherichiu coli (Black et al., 1984b) .",

            "text": "Another explanation is that inflammation of the gastrointestinal mucosa may result in permanent damage to affected tissues, depending on its severity, and hence adversely affect assimilation and absorption (Black et al., 1984a) . Diarrhea may affect growth by depriving growing cells of nutrition needed for growth (Torres et al., 1971; Torres-Medina et al., 1985; Hall et al., 1988) . When a calf has diarrhea, perhaps as a consequence of consuming milk with a high bacterial count, the intestinal epithelium may undergo extensive damage, resulting in conditions such as pseudomembranous ileitis, mucohemorrhagic colitis or proctitis, as observed in E. coli infection (Schoonderwoerd et al., 1988; Janke et al., 1990) . Other conditions of the intestinal epithelium that ma:y reduce absorption and assimilation include villous fusion, villous atrophy, or crypt hyperplasia, as observed in rotavirus infection, or villous atrophy of large and small intestines with destruction of crypt epithelium, as in coronavirus infection (Radostits et al., 1994) . Damaged epithelium may result in reduced normal nutrient absorptive function of the intestine, while new epithelial cells regenerate, or damage to the epithelium may be too extensive for normal repair to take place, resulting in permanent malnutrition of calves. Consequently, calves fed pasteurized milk would be expected to have less compromised intestinal function even after weaning, and would continue to show better growth than calves fed nonpasteurized milk. Several studies conducted on humans (Black et al., 1984a; Barker and Osmond, 1986; Ebrahim, 1989) and in animals (Waltner-Toews et al., 1986; Correa et al., 1988; Thurmond and Pare, 1993) found a similar relationship in that neonatal morbidity adversely affected subsequent performance.",
