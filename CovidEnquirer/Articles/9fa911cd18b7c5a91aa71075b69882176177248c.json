            "text": "Background: The Hajj mass gathering is a risk for pneumococcal disease. This study was performed to evaluate the proportion of adult community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) cases attributable to Streptococcus pneumoniae among Hajj pilgrims in 2016. To add sensitivity to etiological attribution, a urine antigen test was used in addition to culture-based methods. Methods: Adult subjects hospitalized with X-ray-confirmed CAP were enrolled prospectively from all general hospitals designated to treat Hajj pilgrims in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Patients were treated according to local standard of care and administered the BinaxNow S. pneumoniae urine antigen test. Results: From August 23 to September 23, 2016, a total of 266 patients with CAP were enrolled in the study, 70.6% of whom were admitted to hospitals in Mecca; 53% of the cases were admitted after the peak of Hajj. Patients originated from 43 countries. Their mean age was 65.3 years and the male to female ratio was 2:1. Just over 36% of the cases had diabetes, 10% declared that they were smokers, and 45.4% of cases were treated in the intensive care unit (ICU). The overall case-fatality rate was 10.1%, but was higher among those treated in the ICU and in those with invasive disease. The proportion of CAP cases positive for S. pneumoniae, based on culture or urine antigen test, was 18.0% (95% confidence interval 13.9-23.1%). Conclusions: CAP during Hajj has an important clinical impact. A proportion of CAP cases among Hajj pilgrims were attributable to S. pneumoniae, a pathogen for which vaccines are available. Additional studies to determine the serotypes causing pneumococcal disease could further inform vaccine policy for Hajj pilgrims.",

The event can facilitate the acquisition and transmission of infectious agents, including those responsible for respiratory tract infection, and has been linked to both local and international outbreaks of diseases (Ahmed et al., 2006; Memish et al., 2015a,b; Yezli et al., 2016a) . Examples include meningococcal disease and influenza (Salmon-Rousseau et al., 2016; Yezli et al., 2016a) . Experience from Hajj shows that the implementation of appropriate prevention measures such as vaccination can significantly reduce the incidence of disease and outbreaks associated with this mass gathering. Of note is the prevention of meningococcal disease outbreaks since 2001, after the introduction of compulsory vaccination with the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine and targeted chemoprophylaxis (Yezli et al., 2016b) .",

As there was active triaging of all cases of suspected CAP admitted to hospitals during Hajj (due to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) screening), the study is likely to have captured almost all CAP cases admitted to hospitals. CAP patients originated from a wide variety of countries with a sizable proportion being older males, which is reflective of the general population of Hajj. A number of other studies have reported that pneumonia is a leading cause of hospital admission (accounting for 15-40% of hospital admissions) during the pilgrimage (Al-Ghamdi et al., 2003; Khan et al., 2006; Madani et al., 2006; Shirah et al., 2017) .

The organism is commonly isolated from Hajj pilgrims treated in clinics or hospitals during their pilgrimage. Several studies have found S. pneumoniae to be the cause of pneumonia in up to 10% of cases during Hajj (Alzeer et al., 1998; Asghar et al., 2011; Mandourah et al., 2012; Shirah et al., 2017) , while one study found that among 38 patients treated for severe CAP at 15 facilities during the 2013 Hajj, S. pneumoniae was found in 56%, using the Randox respiratory multiplex array (Memish et al., 2014) . Other important causative pathogens reported in these studies have included other bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, K. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and viruses including human rhinovirus, influenza A virus, and human coronaviruses, as well as the fungus Candida albicans. The results of this study are likely to be a more accurate reflection of the actual proportion of CAP caused by S. pneumoniae during Hajj, as the urine antigen test was used in addition to the standard culture-based methods. The test adds sensitivity to the etiological attribution without minimizing specificity (Mandell et al., 2003) and overcomes many of the limitations and difficulties in culturing S. pneumoniae from clinical samples (Bartlett, 2011) . Although the test was highly specific in this study, it had lower sensitivity than that reported in other studies (Mandell et al., 2003) .",

Admission to an ICU was based on patient clinical assessment and the need for respiratory or hemodynamic support (Arabi and Alhamid, 2006) . Pneumonia is a leading cause of ICU admission during Hajj, accounting for 22-31% of ICU admissions, and is a major cause of severe sepsis and septic shock in ICUs during the event (Madani et al., 2007; Mandourah et al., 2012; Shirah et al., 2017) . The case-fatality rate for CAP patients in this study was 10.1%, which is within the range of rates reported for CAP internationally (Drijkoningen and Rohde, 2014; Vila-Corcoles et al., 2016) . Also, case fatality was higher among those admitted/treated in an ICU and among those with invasive disease. This is also in accordance with other reports, including those among Hajj pilgrims (Drijkoningen and Rohde, 2014; Mandourah et al., 2012; Shirah et al., 2017) , and is likely because patients treated in the ICU or those with invasive disease have a more severe illness and are at a higher risk of death.",

            "text": "Most CAP cases in this study were admitted to Mecca hospitals, and the number of cases increased over the study period, with the highest admission rate being after the Hajj rituals days. This pattern is in accordance with the Hajj journey and its characteristics. Most pilgrims arrive in KSA a few days (or weeks) before the Hajj ritual dates and spend time in the holy cities of Mecca and/or Medina. During the Hajj dates, all pilgrims return to Mecca to perform the Hajj rituals, most of which take place at the Mecca holy sites. Hence, the pre-Hajj period is characterized by a smaller number of pilgrims, living in less crowded environments, spread across both Mecca and Medina, and relatively free of stressors associated with performing the Hajj rituals. During the Hajj dates, the maximum numbers of pilgrims are located in a small area of Mecca performing physically challenging Hajj rituals in crowded conditions, under both physical and environmental stressors. These conditions facilitate disease transmission and render pilgrims more prone to infection. It is likely that many CAP cases admitted after Hajj were infected during the Hajj dates. This may explain the increase in the number of CAP cases post-Hajj, while the number of pilgrims in Mecca and Medina was decreasing.",

            "text": "Most CAP cases were elderly males and many had diabetes or were smokers. Although no significant association was found between these factors and pneumococcal pneumonia in this study, age, co-morbidities, and smoking are established risk factors for CAP, including pneumococcal pneumonia (Almirall et al., 2017; Lynch and Zhanel, 2009 ). The latter is a vaccine-preventable disease and the above risk factors are indications for pneumococcal vaccination in adults (Tomczyk et al., 2014) . The finding that a proportion of CAP during Hajj was caused by S. pneumoniae, and that most of it was among individuals at risk of the disease, is significant. Currently, pneumococcal vaccination is not one of the officially recommended/compulsory vaccinations in the Hajj health requirements set by the Saudi authorities (Saudi Ministry of Health, 2017). Although some countries have recommended pneumococcal vaccination for their Hajj pilgrims (Feldman et al., 2013; Mathai et al., 2016; Rashid et al., 2013) , an evidence-based policy requires a better understanding of the clinical and economic burden of the disease associated with Hajj. This study is a first step in providing such data, by defining the burden of the disease in the Hajj season using a more reliable diagnostic test for pneumococcal pneumonia. However, further studies are warranted, including accurate estimations of the incidence of the disease during the mass gathering and determining the serotypes causing the illness.",

            "text": "This study has some limitations. It was aimed to systematically enroll all hospitalized X-ray-confirmed CAP cases among Hajj pilgrims during the study period. However, very early pneumonia may not be apparent on chest radiographs and may have led to the exclusion of some cases from the study. Not all CAP cases were investigated using culture-based methods, which are not routinely conducted by hospitals during Hajj due to feasibility. Some of the information collected from pilgrims was self-reported (e.g., smoking status) and hence may be subject to underreporting. Also, information on the pneumococcal disease vaccination status of the cases was not collected, so it was not possible to investigate the effect of vaccination. In addition, as no accurate data on the adult population at risk during the study period were available, it was not possible to accurately estimate the incidence of CAP during Hajj. In conclusion, S. pneumoniae-attributable CAP during Hajj has an important clinical burden. Further studies, including investigations of the incidence of the disease and S. pneumoniae serotypes involved in the disease, as well as the identification of the population at risk, are warranted to provide a comprehensive evidence base for appropriate policy-making regarding vaccination of Hajj pilgrims.",
