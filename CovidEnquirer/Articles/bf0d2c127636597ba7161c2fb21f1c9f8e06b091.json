The cytoplasmic tails of both proteins are important for this interaction. We also examined the ability of the mutant and chimeric E and M proteins to form VLPs. IBV M proteins that are missing portions of their cytoplasmic tails or transmembrane regions were not able to support VLP formation, regardless of their ability to be crosslinked to IBV E.

            "text": "Enveloped viruses acquire their lipid membranes from those of the host cell in a process known as budding, in which the virus envelope proteins accumulate at the appropriate membrane and cooperate with the nucleocapsid and other viral components to induce membrane curvature and pinching (Garoff et al., 1998) . Most well-studied enveloped viruses, such as influenza and retroviruses, bud from the plasma membrane of cells, which results in the release of virus particles from the host cell as soon as the pinching process is complete. However, the envelopes of other viruses are derived by budding into the lumen of intracellular secretory compartments, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus (Griffiths and Rottier, 1992) . Intracellular budding is a seemingly more complex way of obtaining a lipid envelope, since virus particles are contained within intracellular membrane-bound compartments as a result of budding. The newly budded viruses presumably exploit the cellular secretory pathway to exit the cell for a new round of infection. The reasons that some enveloped viruses have evolved to bud inside the cell are not known. Several clinically important viruses bud into intracellular membranes. Viruses of the family Flaviviridae, which include hepatitis C virus and Kunjin virus, derive their lipid envelopes by budding into the lumen of the ER (Dubois-Dalcq et al., 1984; Mackenzie and Westaway, 2001) . As another example, the hemorrhagic fever-causing Hantaviruses, members of the family Bunyaviridae, bud into the membranes of the Golgi complex (Hung et al., 1985; Pettersson, 1991) . The advantage provided by intracellular budding remains an interesting and important question in the biology of these and other viruses that obtain their envelopes from intracellular membranes.",

Accumulating evidence indicates that the E and M proteins are instrumental in this process. Rottier and colleagues made the initial observation that mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) E and M proteins are sufficient to produce membrane-bound particles very similar to virions in size and shape (Vennema et al., 1996) , and this result has been confirmed with the E and M proteins of several other coronaviruses (Baudoux et al., 1998; Corse and Machamer, 2000; Godeke et al., 2000) . These observations suggest that coronavirus budding is directed by envelope proteins alone, which is an unusual type of enveloped virus assembly (Garoff et al., 1998) . The coronavirus E protein appears to play a critical role in the budding step, since mutations introduced into the cytoplasmic tail of MHV E by targeted RNA recombination result in elongated virions (Fischer et al., 1998) . Indeed, it has been shown that both the MHV E and the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) E proteins are sufficient for formation of the virus-like particles (VLPs) described above (Corse and Machamer, 2000; Maeda et al., 1999) , although the efficiency probably varies with cell type and protein expression system.",

We have previously shown that the IBV M and E proteins independently localize to the Golgi region of transfected cells (Corse and Machamer, 2000; Machamer and Rose, 1987) and characterized the Golgi targeting signals in the two proteins that direct this localization (Corse and Machamer, 2002; Machamer et al., 1993) . In the study described here, we examined interactions between the IBV E and M proteins in transfected OST7-1 cells using the chemical crosslinker dithiobis[succinimidyl propionate] (DSP). Using mutant E and M proteins that are correctly targeted to the Golgi complex, we found that the cytoplasmic tails of both proteins are required for their interaction. We found that IBV E and M proteins can be efficiently assembled into VLPs in OST7-1 cells, and we investigated which domains of IBV E and M are required for this process. Interestingly, the interaction of M and E, as measured by crosslinking, was not sufficient for VLP formation. It is likely that interactions of E and M with each other as well as the membrane bilayer are important for VLP formation and virus budding.",

We wanted to investigate the possibility that this precise colocalization was indicative of a physical interaction between the two proteins. Since attempts to coimmunoprecipitate E and M proteins from IBV-infected Vero cells in a variety of detergent conditions were unsuccessful, we employed the cellpermeable chemical crosslinker DSP, which is a thiol-cleavable molecule that contains two amine-reactive groups separated by a 12 \u00c5 spacer arm. IBV-infected Vero cells were radiolabeled at 45 h postinfection and treated with DSP prior to lysis and immunoprecipitation with anti-E or anti-M antibodies. When we analyzed the immunoprecipitates by SDS-PAGE, we found that M was present in the anti-E immunoprecipitations and vice versa (Fig. 1B, lanes  4 and 8) . This association was dependent on the presence of DSP since it was not seen in samples that were mock-treated (lanes 2 and 6). Immunoprecipitation with irrelevant antibodies yielded no visible bands (not shown). In the absence of \u2424-mercaptoethanol, which cleaves the disulfide bond of DSP, the unseparated crosslinked E and M proteins were present as high molecular weight aggregates and migrated at a high position on the gel (not shown). The crosslinking and coimmunoprecipitation was not quantitative, since only a fraction of the total E protein (as measured by the amount of E in the anti-E immunoprecipitation) was found in the anti-M immunoprecipitation. This could be due to the inherent inefficiency of chemical crosslinking. Alternatively, this result could reflect the small E:M ratio in virions (Liu Fig. 1 . IBV E and M colocalize and interact in IBV-infected Vero cells. (A) IBV-infected Vero cells were fixed for immunofluorescence at 6 h postinfection and double labeled with rat anti-E antibody (a) and rabbit anti-M antibody (b).

IBV E is coprecipitated with IBV M after crosslinking and vice versa. These data are representative of at least three independent experiments. and Inglis, 1991), which is presumably determined by the stoichiometry of envelope protein interactions. We conclude that the IBV E and M proteins interact in infected cells.",

As expected, the IBV E and M proteins colocalized in a compact perinuclear region characteristic of the Golgi complex in this cell type, as seen previously in BHK-21 cells (Corse and Machamer, 2000) . When we treated OST7-1 cells coexpressing IBV E and M with DSP and analyzed anti-E and anti-M immunoprecipitates as described above, we found that M protein was present in the anti-E immunoprecipitate (Fig. 2, lane 4) and that E protein was present in the anti-M immunoprecipitate (Fig. 2, lane 8) , suggesting that the two proteins directly interact in transfected cells. Detection of the interaction required crosslinking (compare lanes 3 and 7 to lanes 4 and 8) and antisera specific for E or M. Even though less E was expressed in transfected cells (Fig. 2 ) compared to IBV-infected cells (Fig. 1B) , the ratio of E:M crosslinks (as seen in the relative amounts of E and M in the anti-M and anti-E immunoprecipitations, respectively) was similar, suggesting that there is a precise stoichiometry of interaction.",

Although many mutant E and M proteins have been generated, in this study, we used only those that are properly targeted to the Golgi region. Since these mutant proteins had previously been localized in BHK-21 or COS-7 cells, we first confirmed that they were properly targeted in OST-7 cells. Cells coexpressing wildtype M protein and E mutants were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3A) . EG3 (panels d-f) contains the transmembrane domain from the plasma membrane protein vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G; CTE (panels g-i) is an N-terminal truncation of IBV E consisting only of its cytoplasmic tail, and GEt (panels j-l) is a chimeric protein containing the lumenal and transmembrane domains of VSV G and the cytoplasmic tail of IBV E. In all cases, the E mutant proteins were correctly localized to the Golgi region of OST7-1 cells (including the partial transmembrane replacement mutants EG1 and EG2, not shown), consistent with our previous studies in BHK-21 cells (Corse and Machamer, 2002) . Fig. 3B shows cells that are coexpressing wild-type E protein and the M protein deletion mutants Mct\u232c1 (panels a-c), which is missing cytoplasmic tail amino acid residues 103-203, Mct\u232c2 (panels d-f), which is missing cytoplasmic tail residues 119 -203, Mct\u232c3 (panels g-i), which is missing cytoplasmic tail residues 103-118, or M\u232cm2,3 (panels j-l), which is missing the second and third transmembrane domains (amino acid residues 43-101). The M mutants, especially Mct\u232c3 (Fig. 3B , panel h) and M\u232cm2,3 (Fig. 3B , panel k), were incompletely localized to the Golgi region, since some ER staining was observed. However, they all reached the Golgi to some extent, as indicated by the juxtanuclear spot.",

M\u232cm2,3 is missing the second and third transmembrane domains of IBV M; since it was crosslinked to E protein as well as wild-type M (lanes 5 and 10), we conclude that these membrane-spanning regions are not involved in interactions with E. A large portion of the M cytoplasmic tail is deleted in Mct\u232c1 (see Fig. 3B ), and this protein was not crosslinked efficiently to E, compared to wild-type M protein (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 7) , although a small amount of E protein is visible in the Mct\u232c1 immunoprecipitation (Fig. 5, lane 7) . This result indicates that the M cytoplasmic tail is involved in interaction with E. The portion of the M cytoplasmic tail removed by the Mct\u232c1 deletion is split into parts by the Mct\u232c2 and Mct\u232c3 deletions. Note that the Mct\u232c1 and Mct\u232c2 mutants are not radiolabeled as efficiently as wild-type M and the Mct\u232c3 and M\u232cm2,3 mutants (compare lanes 7 and 8 with lane 6) because they have fewer methionines and cysteines due to their deletions, which could explain why a reciprocal amount of Mct\u232c1 is not seen in the anti-E immunoprecipitation (Fig. 5,  lane 2) . Mct\u232c3, which is missing amino acids 103-118 of the M cytoplasmic tail, was crosslinked to E (Fig. 5, lanes 4 and 9) , while Mct\u232c2, which is missing amino acids 119 -203 of the M cytoplasmic tail (see Fig. 2B ), was not (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 8) .

            "text": "The E and M proteins of several coronaviruses are released from cotransfected cells in membrane-bound particles that are morphologically similar to virions (VLPs), suggesting that interactions between these proteins are an integral part of coronavirus assembly (Baudoux et al., 1998; Corse and Machamer, 2000; Godeke et al., 2000; Vennema et al., 1996) . We initially attempted to study VLPs formed in BHK cells from IBV E and M proteins expressed by coinfection with recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding each protein. However, we found that VLP formation was extremely inefficient under these conditions and estimated that only 0.01% of the cellular E and M proteins were released into the supernatant as VLPs (Corse and Machamer, 2000) . Since we were interested in using VLP formation to delineate portions of the IBV E and M proteins that are important in virus assembly, we employed the expression system used by Rottier and colleagues in their initial description of MHV VLPs (Vennema et al., 1996) . These authors infected OST7-1 cells (Elroy-Stein and Moss, 1990) , which are osteosarcoma cells that stably express phage T7 RNA polymerase, with a vaccinia virus encoding T7 polymerase (vTF7-3) (Fuerst et al., 1986) to provide higher levels of T7 RNA polymerase. They then transfected the cells with plasmids encoding MHV E and M behind the T7 promoter. When we expressed the IBV E and M proteins this way, we found that VLPs were formed efficiently (Fig.  6, lanes 3 and 14) . The supernatant side of the gel (lanes 12-22) shown in this figure was exposed 20 times longer than the cell side to allow the visualization of E and E transmembrane mutant proteins (lanes 1-11). We have consistently observed at least 10%, and frequently more, of the cellular M protein being released into the supernatant during the 3 h chase (data not shown). This level of VLP release was dependent on E protein, since less than 1% of the cellular M protein was found in the supernatant in the absence of E. E protein was not visualized in the supernatants when expressed alone (Fig. 6, lane 12) . We believe that a small amount of E is released into the supernatant when it is expressed alone, and that it is simply not visualized unless a large amount of supernatant is loaded on the gel, as in our previous experiments (Corse and Machamer, 2000) . Our results differ from the data of Makino and colleagues, who observed a substantial amount of MHV E being released into the supernatant when expressed by itself (Maeda et al., 1999) ; this discrepancy could be explained by the different expression system used to produce the E protein in their study. We favor the hypothesis that VLP formation involves a lattice of M protein within the membrane with curvature induced by small amounts of the E protein (see Discussion). This would account for the small amount of IBV E protein relative to IBV M protein that is found in VLPs.",

We conclude that the GEt chimera does not induce VLPs. Since both the EG3 and the GEt chimeras contain the transmembrane domain of VSV G and the cytoplasmic tail of IBV E, it seems likely that the VSV G lumenal domain is incompatible with VLP formation, either because it is too large or because it cannot be incorporated into the M protein lattice for some other reason (see Discussion). Thus, it is difficult to predict if the E cytoplasmic tail alone is capable of inducing VLPs. We also did not observe VLP formation with the IBV E N-terminal truncation mutant CTE, which consists only of the E cytoplasmic tail (data not shown). However, this result is inconclusive since the CTE protein is less stable than wild-type E protein and thus accumulates to significantly lower levels (Corse and Machamer, 2002) .",

As mentioned above, we did not attempt to find a region within the E tail that mediates its interaction with IBV M, because we previously found that partial or complete replacement of a 50 amino acid region in the IBV E tail results in transport of a reporter chimera from the Golgi complex to the cell surface, which indicates that the cytoplasmic tail of E contains Golgi targeting information (Corse and Machamer, 2002) .

Thus the physical nature of the coronavirus envelope must be largely determined by the characteristics of the M protein. Interestingly, however, the M protein cannot drive coronavirus budding by itself, but displays a strict requirement for a small amount of E protein for VLP formation (Baudoux et al., 1998; Corse and Machamer, 2000; Godeke et al., 2000; Vennema et al., 1996) . We have observed this low E protein:M protein ratio in IBV VLPs (Fig. 6, lane 14) ; measurements of the amount of E and M proteins in IBV virions also reveal a relatively low amount of E protein (Liu and Inglis, 1991) . We favor the hypothesis that VLP formation involves a specific membrane curvature that is induced by the proper ratio of M and E proteins. The mechanism by which a small amount of E protein interacts with a large amount of M protein to induce invagination and pinching of the membrane to form VLPs Fig. 7 . Cytoplasmic and transmembrane region deletion mutants of IBV M do not support VLP formation. OST7-1 cells expressing the indicated proteins were labeled with with [ 35 S]methionine-cysteine for 1 h and chased for 3 h, and the supernatants and cells were harvested and immunoprecipitated with anti-E and anti-M antibodies as described under Materials and methods.

These data are representative of at least three independent experiments. remains unclear, but its elucidation is likely to be essential for a complete understanding of coronavirus assembly.

In this study VLPs were also produced with a BCV-TGEV chimeric M protein. Interestingly, the chimeric M protein was able to form VLPs with TGEV E, BCV E, and BCV-TGEV chimeric E proteins. Since TGEV and BCV are in different coronavirus groups based on serological and genomic sequence relationships, this suggests that VLP formation does not depend on interactions between E and M proteins that are based on strict sequence requirements. Well-conserved three-dimensional characteristics of the E and M proteins may be instrumental in VLP formation.",

It is possible that VLP formation requires interactions between M proteins, as proposed by Rottier and colleagues . These workers demonstrated homotypic interactions among MHV M protein molecules by coimmunoprecipitation and incorporation of VLP assembly-incompetent MHV M mutants into VLPs via their interaction with assembly-competent MHV M proteins. These authors hypothesize that the VLP (and virion) envelope mainly consists of an M protein lattice, with a few E proteins interspersed within this lattice. Although we have not examined whether homotypic interactions between IBV M proteins exist, we think it possible that such interactions may be important in IBV VLP assembly. We did observe a small amount of SDS-resistant IBV M protein dimers in our anti-M immunoprecipitations (indicated by asterisks in Figs. 2, 4 , 5, and 6), although we have no direct evidence that these dimers are physiologically relevant.",

Since the GEt chimera contains the same transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail as the transmembrane replacement mutant EG3, which was able to induce VLP formation as well as wild-type E protein (Fig.  6) , a likely explanation is that the VSV G ectodomain prevents induction of VLPs. One possibility is that this large ectodomain does not fit well into the lattice of M protein in the membrane. A similar observation was reported by Rottier and colleagues , who showed that foreign proteins such as wild-type VSV G protein, equine arteritis virus M protein, and CD8 were effectively excluded from MHV VLPs. Likewise, it is possible that the M deletion mutants we tested in the VLP assay are not in the right conformation to fit into such a lattice of M protein, and thus, do not support VLP formation.",

Since these and other Golgi scaffold proteins are known to be part of a complex which is thought to mediate vesicle tethering during intra-Golgi transport (Barr et al., 1998; Seemann et al., 2000a,b) , this led us to hypothesize that the IBV E protein may be targeted to the Golgi apparatus via a direct interaction with one or more Golgi scaffold proteins. Furthermore, interaction of IBV E with the Golgi scaffold could result in modulation of vesicular traffic, which might be advantageous for collecting coronavirus envelope proteins in a specific Golgi compartment for assembly (Corse and Machamer, 2002) .",

If not, then it is possible that two functional pools of IBV E protein exist in an infected cell. One pool could interact with IBV M and the membrane at the assembly site to induce virus budding, while the other could associate with the Golgi scaffold to influence vesicular traffic through the Golgi complex. The latter interaction might aid in collecting viral membrane proteins for assembly at Golgi membranes. Since the small amount of IBV E protein found in virions (Liu and Inglis, 1991) and VLPs (shown here) suggests that not much E protein is required to induce virus budding, maybe a second function of E protein, such as modulation of Golgi transport, accounts for the apparent excess of IBV E protein in infected cells (Corse and Machamer, 2000) .",

In samples transfected with only a plasmid encoding IBV E or IBV M alone, an equal amount of empty vector plasmid was added so that an equal amount of plasmid DNA was added to all samples. At 4 h postinfection, the cells were labeled with 100 Ci of 35 S-Promix (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) in 0.5 ml methionine-and cysteine-free medium for 1 to 1.5 h at 37\u00b0C. Vero cells were plated in a 10-cm dish 1 day before being infected with IBV and labeled at 45 h postinfection for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with 500 Ci of 35 S-Promix. After being rinsed twice in room temperature PBS, cells were scraped into PBS, transferred to microfuge tubes, and the thiol-cleavable crosslinker DSP (Pierce, Rockford, IL) was added to 1 mM after being prepared just before use as a 20 mM stock solution in DMSO. For mock DSP treatments an equivalent amount of DMSO was added. The cells were incubated with DSP for 10 min at room temperature, and the DSP was quenched by adding glycine to 40 mM. The cells were lysed in detergent solution [62.5 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris (pH 8), 0.4% deoxycholate, 1% NP-40] containing protease inhibitors, and the postnuclear supernatants were immunoprecipitated with the appropriate antibodies in the presence of 0.2% SDS as described (Machamer and Rose, 1987) . Treatment of immunoprecipitates with N-glycanase was as previously described (Machamer et al., 1990) . The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE in the presence of \u2424mercaptoethanol (except for the indicated samples in Fig. 1B ) and the labeled proteins were visualized by fluorography.",
