Prophylactics and therapies are urgently needed to address this public health problem. We report here the efficacy of a vaccine consisting of chimeric virus-like particles (VLP) expressing the receptor binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV. In this study, a fusion of the canine parvovirus (CPV) VP2 structural protein gene with the RBD of MERS-CoV can self-assemble into chimeric, spherical VLP (sVLP). sVLP retained certain parvovirus characteristics, such as the ability to agglutinate pig erythrocytes, and structural morphology similar to CPV virions. Immunization with sVLP induced RBD-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. sVLP-specific antisera from these animals were able to prevent pseudotyped MERS-CoV entry into susceptible cells, with neutralizing antibody titers reaching 1: 320. IFN-g, IL-4 and IL-2 secreting cells induced by the RBD were detected in the splenocytes of vaccinated mice by ELISpot. Furthermore, mice inoculated with sVLP or an adjuvanted sVLP vaccine elicited T-helper 1 (Th1) and T-helper 2 (Th2) cell-mediated immunity. Our study demonstrates that sVLP displaying the RBD of MERS-CoV are promising prophylactic candidates against MERS-CoV in a potential outbreak situation.",

In our study, mice that received sVLP produced a Th1-biased response with high levels of IL-2 secretion, whereas mice immunized with sVLP \u00fe poly(I:C) produced substantial IFN-g, IL-2 and IL-4 responses, representing mixed Th1 and Th2 responses. In contrast, mice that received sVLP \u00fe Alum did not result in a detectable cellular immune response, likely because Alum is known to be a poor cellular immune response inducer (Maughan et al., 2015) . In contrast, poly(I:C) is a double-stranded RNA polymer that acts as a molecular mimic of viral infection and is recognized by Toll-like receptor 3, resulting in expression of IFN-a/b and Th1-and Th2-related cytokines (Ichinohe et al., 2005) . Furthermore, poly(I:C) has been used in many clinical trials with good results (Okada et al., 2011; Rahimian et al., 2015) . The percentage of CD11c and CD86, CD11c and CD80 double-positive cells was notably increased in mice received regimes containing sVLP, which suggested that sVLP could efficiently recruit or activate DCs in lymph nodes, which is important for effective stimulation of the innate immune response and as a link to the adaptive immune response (Grgacic and Anderson, 2006) . In addition to CD11c \u00fe and CD80 \u00fe , CD11c \u00fe and CD86 \u00fe were highest in mice injected with poly(I:C) adjuvanted sVLP, the IgG levels was highest in the poly(I:C) adjuvanted group. In summary, poly(I:C) adjuvanted sVLP is a promising vaccine regimens for the next stage of pre-clinical testing in larger animal models, and the dosage, route of administration and intervals of immunization will need to be further evaluated and optimized to maximize chances of a successful vaccination.",
