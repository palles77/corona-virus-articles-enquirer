Patients with severe pneumonia in MERS-coronavirus infection had more impaired pulmonary function than those with no or mild pneumonia at the 1-year follow-up, which was compatible with the radiological sequelae. Severe pneumonia significantly impairs pulmonary function and makes long radiological sequelae in MERS.",

Positive MERS-CoV rRT-PCR findings were observed in patients with no or mild symptoms, who were also subjected to epidemiological investigation and follow-up. 1",

The pulmonary function tests included total lung capacity (TLC), forced volume vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ), and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO). All pulmonary function values were presented as predicted percentage considering age, sex, height, body weight, and race. Radiological sequelae were scored as the number of involved lung segments (total score = 19) on chest CT that were suspected to be post-inflammation sequelae, including sub-segmental atelectasis, ground glass opacity, and consolidation by a radiologist. 10 Emphysema, sequelae of tuberculosis, and bronchiectasis were excluded. Severe pneumonia was defined as the patient requiring oxygen therapy, mild pneumonia was defined as the patient presenting with infiltration on chest X-ray but not requiring oxygen therapy, and no pneumonia was defined as the patient without radiographic evidence of pneumonia. 11 Linear regression or linear by linear association was used to evaluate the association between the severity of pneumonia and continuous or categorical variables, as appropriate. The correlation between pneumonia severity and pulmonary function or radiological sequelae was evaluated using a multivariable linear regression model including age, sex, underlying lung diseases, and smoking. P < 0.05 was considered significant. IBM SPSS Statistics (version 22; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used for all statistical analyses.",

For this reason, we compared lung function according to the severity of pneumonia in order to evaluate the effect of MERS-CoV infection on pulmonary function. The finding that more severe MERS pneumonia resulted in more impaired lung function strongly suggests that pulmonary sequelae can remain at least 1 year after MERS-CoV pneumonia, which is also supported by the correlation of radiological sequela correlated with the severity of MERS pneumonia.",

Second, because we defined pneumonia as infiltration on chest X-ray, we may classify a patient with mild pneumonia in the group without pneumonia. In fact, radiological sequelae on chest CT was observed in approximately 25% of the patients without pneumonia. Third, only 50% of the eligible MERS-CoV infected survivors were enrolled, which may not represent all of the MERS-CoV survivors in Korea. Forth, no baseline pulmonary function or CT scans were not available. Lastly, our definition of severe pneumonia as requirement of oxygen therapy may be broad and subjective.
