            "text": "One of the fi rst applications of risk assessment was by NASA in the aftermath of the 1967 Apollo fi re. Risk assessment is now widely used in different scientifi c disciplines including nuclear science, fi nance, industrial processing and infectious diseases. Charles Haas used risk assessment in the latter fi eld for the fi rst time to mathematically describe a dose-response relationship for adverse public health events due to virus ingestion (Haas, 1983 ) . The methodology was subsequently extended, with an exposure assessment to estimate the exposure dose and a risk quantifi cation for the presence of viruses in drinking water (Haas et al., 1993 ) . Despite this initial focus on viruses, quantitative microbiological risk assessments for food and water have so far focused predominantly on bacteria. Recently completed assessments include models that describe the entire food production pathway from production of the raw material until the moment of consumption (often described as 'farm-to-fork' models). Examples of this include the assessment of public health risks associated with E. coli O157:H7 in ground beef hamburgers (Cassin et al., 1998 ) with Listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat foods (Rocourt et al., 2003 ) and with Campylobacter on broiler meat (Nauta et al., 2009 ) . Such farm-to-fork models are now being developed for viruses in food for the fi rst time as part of the European project 'Integrated monitoring and control of foodborne viruses in European food supply chains' ('VITAL').",

Some risk profi les, a term which references the fi rst part of quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) as described above, have been reported for foodborne viruses. These include risk profi les of the Norwalk-like virus in raw molluscs in New Zealand (Greening et al., 2003 ) , foodborne norovirus infections (HPA, 2004 ) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) (Bouwknegt et al., 2009 ) . Factors such as the persistence of virus infectivity on foods, the role of irrigation water and food handlers' hands in virus transmission and the effectiveness of existing virus control points in food harvesting, processing and handling have had limited representation in the available data. It was therefore concluded at an international meeting of experts in 2007 that undertaking a full quantitative risk assessment for foodborne virus may be premature (FAO/WHO, 2008a ) . However, increased interest in food-and waterborne viruses and the development of accessible and rapid diagnostic methods in recent years has increased the amount of available data related to viruses in foods and water, with the result that quantitative models could now start to be designed.",

            "text": "The choice of statistical distribution used and the assumptions made in quantitative risk assessments affect the estimated risks. Regli et al . ( 1991 ) and Haas et al . ( 1993 ) present a theoretical background for the estimation of infection risks due to consumption of drinking water which can also be useful for estimates related to the consumption of other matrices such as food. Regli et al . ( 1991 ) describe the assumptions which must be made in virological risk assessment and go on to evaluate different dose-response models (exponential and Beta-Poisson). Haas et al . ( 1993 ) provide an approach to including uncertainty and variability in risk assessments. These studies demonstrate the importance of understanding (1) the theoretical backgrounds of the distributions used; (2) the randomness or lack thereof in processes leading to viral contamination; (3) the essence of the dose-response models used (the measured response, the unit of the exposure dose); and (4) that uncertainty and variability are essential to the proper conduct of quantitative viral risk assessments. The three models particularly focused on fresh produce centre on the use of irrigation water for salad crops Hamilton et al., 2006 ) . modelled the clinging of viruses to lettuce crops through sprayed irrigation water. The volume of retained water was taken from a study in which lettuce heads were immersed fully in water (Shuval et al., 1997 ) . The estimated volume amounted to approximately 10 ml per 100 g of lettuce, an estimate which was also later used in relation to lettuce by Hamilton et al . ( 2006 ) . In the absence of better data, this volume was considered to represent a worst-case situation and provided an acceptable starting point for risk assessment. However, full immersion of crops might not accurately represent a worst-case scenario, as the volume of water on shrubs is reported to be larger after a simulated rainfall event than after immersion (Garcia-Estringana et al., 2010 ) . Ideally the volume of water retained after single and multiple irrigation events should therefore be examined experimentally. Such an experiment was conducted by Hamilton et al . ( 2006 ) for broccoli, grand slam cabbage, savoy cabbage and winter head cabbage. Their results gave estimated mean water retentions of 0.02, 0.04, 0.04 and 0.09 ml per g of produce, respectively, after a single irrigation event of 20 min. Probability distributions that may be used in a quantitative risk assessment are provided in the paper.",

Examples of risk assessment outcomes include identifi cation of exposure doses, risk of infection, likelihood of illness and possible resultant levels of mortality. An important aspect to consider in the translation of an exposure dose to an adverse health event is the dose-response model used, and how this relates to the subsequent modelled response. Depending on the data set underlying the dose-response model, the initial translation from dose to risk represents the risk of the specifi c response used in that particular dose-response model. For instance, the model to estimate norovirus infection risks was based on volunteers showing faecal excretion of virus and seroconversion (Teunis et al., 2008 ) . In the same study, the dose-response model for illness conditional on infection was based on a response including diarrhoea and/or vomiting combined with other symptoms such as abdominal pain, myalgia, fatigue, chills and headache more than 8 h after the infection. Thus, employing either the fi rst or both models estimates the respective response observed in the volunteers.",

This measure is a combination of the years of life lost due to premature mortality and the period of time spent in a suboptimal health status as a consequence of infection. A DALY estimate therefore includes the translation from infection to actual disease. Such an estimate may give greater insight into the adverse health effects of pathogens in the environment than an infection risk, as infection does not necessarily produce illness. The WHO use DALY to measure the global burden of disease (Lopez et al., 2006 ) , and also base their targets for public health protection on DALYs rather than on infection or illness risks. However, the progression from infection to disease can be highly variable between individual humans and depends on multiple host and pathogen characteristics.

For shellfi sh, numerous data on viruses in harvesting waters are available, whilst for fresh produce, studies are available on foodborne viruses in irrigation water and manure. With regard to food handling environments, a number of foodborne viruses in human and animal faeces have been determined. Nevertheless, such virus presence has largely been determined qualitatively (presence or absence) rather than quantitatively (enumerated). Suffi cient quantitative data (with respect to sampling size and numbers of viral particles) for the performance of quantitative risk assessments is therefore still largely unavailable. Furthermore, the infectivity status of the viruses detected often remains unknown, as molecular methods detect nucleic acids from both infectious and non-infectious viruses, and the non-infectious viruses do not contribute to the risk of a public health event. These data issues therefore enforce an integrated approach at present for quantitative risk assessmentsan approach which includes proper data collection by means of statistically sound sampling plans and proper data analysis using appropriate diagnostic controls and statistical controls for quantifi cation. Another aspect that needs to be considered in quantitative risk assessment is the transfer of viruses to and from foods due to handling and processing. Some data are available for transfer between surfaces and hands (Sattar et al., 2000 ; Bidawid et al., 2004 ) . and these have been used to model, for example, norovirus transfer (Mokhtari and Jaykus, 2009 ). However, robust estimates are not possible given the limited data available. Details of virus transfer between food products, hands and utensils are therefore largely unquantifi ed and uncertain. Viral transfer from carriers (humans, animals) or environmental sources to foods, as well as between foods, are largely based on assumptions rather than on experimental or fi eld data. It is deemed important to perform virus transfer experiments under controlled settings following specifi ed protocols. It was shown that 1% (0.2-10%), 0.05% (0.02-0.3%) and 9% (4-15%) of infectious MNV-1 was transferred from fi ngertips to raspberries, strawberries and lettuce, respectively (Verhaelen et al., in preparation). The transfer fractions of MNV-1 from raspberries and lettuce to fi ngertips was 3% (<0.01-5%) and 4% (2-6%), respectively. Using the estimated mean transfer rate of MNV-1, it was estimated that a single food handler with an initial virus contamination level of 10 4 infectious virus particles on his fi ngertips could contaminate more than 2 kg of raspberries with a minimum of one virus particle per raspberry. This study exemplifi es the substantial role a single food handler can have in the transmission of hNoV, considering hNoV is the most infectious agent described, with an infection probability of about 0.5 per single hNoV particle (Teunis et al., 2008 ) .",

Furthermore, the food matrix itself can induce virus inactivation due to, for example, the effects of pH or the presence of proteases. For most intact fresh produce, no recommended storage temperature is provided by legislation. In general, low temperatures and high relative humidity are applied in the fresh produce industry to prolong shelf-life and maintain produce quality. Unlike for bacteria, these conditions generally promote viral persistence. The usual storage temperature of lettuce, for example, is about 4 \u00b0 C with a relative humidity (RH) of about 80%. The shelf-life of lettuce is strongly dependent on storage conditions: a shelf-life of 21-28 days can be expected at 0 \u00b0 C with >95% RH, whilst at 5 \u00b0 C a shelf-life of 14 days can be expected. At point of sale, whole lettuces are usually stored at ambient temperature. Persistence of feline calicivirus (FCV) on lettuce in commonly applied storage conditions was studied by Mattison et al . ( 2007 ) . After 4 days of storage at 21 \u00b0 C the virus was not detectable, which is equivalent to a reduction of about 2.5 log 10 -units. Infectious FCV was reduced by about 2 log 10 -units after seven days of storage at 4 \u00b0 C. Murine norovirus (MNV-1) was found to be persistent on raspberries and strawberries at 4 and 10 \u00b0 C, meaning that the D-values (fi rst 1 log 10 unit reduction) reached or exceeded the 7-day shelf-life of the berries. However, MNV-1 infectivity dropped by about 1.5 log 10 -units on strawberries after just one day of storage at room temperature, whereas no virus decay was observed on raspberries in this period. A 1 log 10 unit decrease in MNV-1 infectivity only occurred on raspberries after 3 days at room temperature, yet in practice, raspberries are rarely stored over such a long period.

The effectiveness of treatment processes for virus reduction has mostly been assessed by use of indicator viruses such as MNV (murine norovirus), FCV and phages. In order to conduct a quantitative viral risk assessment, it is important to fi rst know which decontamination practices are used in food production, whilst acknowledging that lab experiments may produce different outcomes to standard virus reduction due to current practices in the fi eld. Secondly, process-specifi c infectivity rates for each virus, or an appropriate surrogate thereof, should ideally be included in the study. Unfortunately, the lack of cell culture systems for certain viruses, including NoV and HEV, have hampered such studies in the past. Alternative approaches, such as the use of animal models (Feagins et al., 2008 ) or cell infection experiments (Emerson et al., 2005 ) have been developed for HEV. The results of both experiments indicated that HEV was still viable when heated at 56 \u00b0 C for an hour. In an in vivo animal experiment, one of the livers used as inoculum was stir-fried at 191 \u00b0 C (internal temperature of 71 \u00b0 C) for 5 min and infection was not observed after inoculation. Furthermore, recent progress in HEV culture has been made in the European project 'VITAL', by using a 3D cell culture system. Initial experiments with this system have shown that HEV is inactivated when heated at 100 \u00b0 C for 15 s (Berto et al., 2012 ) . Hence, HEV seems to be heat-intolerant above a certain temperature, but the temperature-dependent inactivation rate is yet to be determined.",

Hepatitis E (at least genotype 1) poses a particular threat to pregnant women, who are at high risk of developing severe hepatitis, resulting in mortality in up to 25% of cases for this category.

At present, where such systems are not routinely available, as is the case for NoV, HAV and HEV, one is restricted to the use of indirect methods such as genome detection by (RT-) PCR. The methods for correct use of qPCR data in QMRA are lacking, which leads to the currently unavoidable ignorance of two aspects: (1) distinction between genomes originating from infectious (viable) and non-infectious (non-viable) micro-organisms; and (2) uncertainty and bias in quantifi cation of genomes. Distinction between infectious and non-infectious micro-organisms cannot be made with qPCR directly, because the detected genomes can originate from both types of micro-organism. Approaches to distinguish between the two by using, for example, enzymatic pre-treatment are being explored at present (Schielke et al., 2011 ) . Furthermore, results generated by qPCR are, when quantifi ed, translated into point estimates of genome quantities according to a standard curve, based on samples with supposedly known concentrations of targets (i.e., the standards). However, points often neglected in such quantifi cation are the effi ciency of isolation of genomic material from samples, differences in amplifi cation effi ciency between the standard and targeted micro-organisms, uncertainty around the estimated concentration of the standards and target viruses, and measurement error of the apparatus. For results of molecular methods to be useful in quantitative risk assessment, new procedures are needed to provide correct quantifi cation, including uncertainty, of infectious micro-organisms detected by qPCR.",

Future trends might include the use of such tools for real-time monitoring, for instance when the models are linked to rapid methods for virus detection in potential sources.",

The results of applying this method can be more informative for public health risk management than the presence/absence and pathogen prevalence data often presented. Furthermore, by identifying the available and the required data for a risk assessment, data gaps can be identifi ed. This information can subsequently be used to allocate research resources more effectively. The development of statistically sound sampling plans for proper data collection that target these data gaps can extend the effective use of resources still further.",
