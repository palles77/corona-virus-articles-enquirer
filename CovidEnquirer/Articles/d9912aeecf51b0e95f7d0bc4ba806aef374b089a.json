Affymetrix microarrays contain between 11 and 20 pairs of oligonucleotide probes for each target RNA, in which one of the pair is the reverse complement to a unique 25-mer in the RNA and the other contains a mutated middle base pair and serves as a measure of stray signal (http://www.affymetrix.com/ index.affx). The chip is arrayed with oligonucleotides that are individually synthesized directly on the chip by automatic procedures until four nucleotides occupy the place. This cycle of reproduction and addition of a nucleotide is repeated until the array carries oligonucleotides that are 20-25 nucleotides in length. In recent years, investigators have developed additional methods for constructing microarrays by synthesizing oligonucleotides in situ. In one approach, Agilent Technologies (http://www.chem.agilent.com) uses ink-jet printer to prepare nucleotides for each DNA synthesis step on a glass slide. In a different approach, NimbleGen Systems (http://www.nimblegen.com) uses \"maskless synthesis\" photolithography that employs digital light processing to generate ultra-high density microarrays on slides, with longer oligonucleotides of 50-70 nucleotides.",

            "text": "In the mid-1990s, Pat Brown and his colleagues developed the \"dot blot\" microarray. The array is made in three steps: (1) preparing the plasmid cDNA clones to be put on the array, using PCRs to amplify the cDNA inserts; large sets of these clones are available from the expressed sequence tag and cDNA sequencing is begun early in the human genome project; (2) spotting the DNA onto the glass surface of the array with a spotting robot; and (3) postspotting processing of the glass slide [13] . During gene expression analysis with cDNA microarrays, four steps are involved: (1) sample preparation and labeling, (2) hybridization, (3) washing, and (4) image acquisition. With these two-color arrays, two different sets of mRNA samples are used, each labeled separately with different fluorescent tags, usually Cy3 (green) or Cy5 (red). One is the control mRNA sample, and the other is the test sample for which the gene expression pattern is to be determined. The two labeled samples are mixed together and competitively hybridized to the glass slide containing cDNA clones. The scanner output is usually two monochrome images, one for each of the two lasers in the scanner. A detector measures the ratio of hybridization signals of the two labels. These are combined to create the red-green color images of microarrays. The images are usually stored as tagged image files. The array data are stored in 16 bits [15] . cDNA microarrays can also be produced as home-spotted arrays, like the Genomic Medicine Research Core Laboratory's (GMRCL) Human 15K set, version 2, which has been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus repository with the accession number GPL5354 [17] .",

Experimental design 5 was a fullfactorial design, because each patient had each sample hybridized twice, once with each Cy dye. There are two main advantages to this method. Firstly, there are two measurements of log ratio for each patient, both using the same number of arrays in experimental design 1. Secondly, the data can be analyzed with a t test or bootstrap t test, whereas Design 4 would require ANOVA analysis.

The patient samples were collected at four time points and a common reference was prepared. About 10 healthy control samples were pooled and used as the common reference. The samples and the common reference were then analyzed in a dye-swapping fashion. With this design, each sample is compared to the common reference. The hypothesis is that, if an array is particularly bright, it will be bright for both the sample and the reference, so the log ratio will be free from this artifact.

This technique has become popular for four reasons: (1) it simplifies large volumes of data; (2) the analysis reveals groups of similar genes; (3) it visualizes the data in a hierarchical way using interactive computer programs; and (4) the results are visualized in a style which is familiar to many geneticists. The algorithm calculates distances between genes or between samples using single linkage, complete linkage, or average linkage. Complete linkage defines the distance between two clusters as the average of the distances between all pairs of points in the two clusters.

First, as microarrays rely on hybridization, accurate measurement is possible only when each feature on the microarray is in great excess over the amount of mRNA in the test sample. Second, crosshybridization, especially in spotted cDNA microarrays, can be another source of error. Therefore, confirmation of the results of gene expression levels is frequently required. One common method is using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-QPCR). Conventional PCR is not quantitative, because the end product is observed only after the bulk of the product has been synthesized. When the rate of synthesis of new molecules has reached a plateau, small differences in the amount of target at the start of the reaction are masked. Real-time measurement of fluorescent product accumulation provides the number of cycles required to attain the linear phase of increase in product biosynthesis [42] . With each cycle, the fluorescence intensity reflects the number of molecules of double-stranded DNA that have been synthesized.",

The two most commonly used methods of analyzing data from RT-QPCR experiments are absolute quantification and relative quantification. Absolute quantification determines the input copy number, usually by relating the PCR signal to a standard curve [42] . Relative quantification measures the PCR signal of the target transcript in a treatment group and compares it to that of another sample (usually an untreated control). The method is convenient in analyzing the relative changes in gene expression from RT-QPCR experiments [42] . In the demonstration by Livak and Schmittgen [42] , the efficiency of the amplification of the target gene (c-myc) and the internal control (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [GAPDH]) was examined using RT-QPCR and TaqMan detection. Using reverse transcriptase, cDNA was synthesized from 1 \u00b5g of total RNA isolated from human Raji cells. Serial dilutions of cDNA were amplified in a real-time PCR using gene-specific primers. The sample contained cDNA derived from 1 ng of total RNA. The \u232cC T (C T c-myc -C T GAPDH) was calculated for each cDNA dilution. If the absolute value of the slope is close to zero, the efficiencies of the target and reference genes are similar, and the \u232c\u232cC T calculation or the relative quantification of target may be used. Important steps in the design and evaluation of a RT-QPCR experiment are: (1) to select an internal control gene, (2) to validate the internal control to determine that it is not affected by experimental treatment, and (3) to perform a PCR on serial dilutions of RNA or cDNA for both the target and internal control genes to ensure that the efficiencies are similar. Finally, statistical data should be converted to the linear form and should not be presented as raw C T values. The purpose of the internal control gene is to normalize the PCRs for the amount of RNA added to the reverse transcription reactions. Standard housekeeping genes usually suffice as internal control genes. Suitable internal controls for RT-QPCR include GAPDH, \u03b2-actin, \u03b2 2 -microglobulin, and rRNA.",

Northern blot analysis and RNA-RNA in situ hybridization studies were also used for verification. When compared with sequences available in the GenBank database, two clones (G32C4B and G30CC) were identified to be the NADH dehydrogenase 4 gene and the gene that encodes ribosomal protein S12, respectively. Increased expression of these two genes was detected in the matched normal tissues collected together with the late International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stages of cervical cancer biopsies. In comparison, upregulation of these two genes was not detected in benign cervical squamous epithelia, suggesting that expression of these two genes in the adjacent histopathologically \"normal\" cervical squamous epithelial tissue may be different from that in cervical cancer [56] . Systematic analysis of the expression pattern during the various steps of cervical tumorigenesis revealed that: (1) there are specific patterns of gene expression in cellular processes during carcinogenesis, and these profiles can discriminate between normal cervical tissue and low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) from high-grade CIN and cervical cancers; (2) many of these genes are also expressed in the stroma adjacent to the cancer tissue; and (3) the extent of gene overexpression is increased during the progression from low-grade to high-grade CIN and finally to cancer [57] [58] [59] [60] .",
