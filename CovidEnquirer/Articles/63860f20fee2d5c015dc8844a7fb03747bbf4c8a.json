            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is considered an emergent pathogen associated with high economic losses in many pig rearing areas. Recently it has been suggested that PEDV could be transmitted to na\u00efve pig populations through inclusion of spray-dried porcine plasma (SDPP) into the nursery diet which led to a ban of SDPP in several areas in North America and Europe. To determine the effect of spray-drying on PEDV infectivity, 3-week-old pigs were intragastrically inoculated with (1) raw porcine plasma spiked with PEDV (RAW-PEDV-CONTROL), (2) porcine plasma spiked with PEDV and then spray dried (SD-PEDV-CONTROL), (3) raw plasma from PEDV infected pigs (RAW-SICK), (4) spraydried plasma from PEDV infected pigs (SD-SICK), or (5) spray-dried plasma from PEDV negative pigs (SD-NEG-CONTROL). For the spray-drying process, a tabletop spray-dryer with industry-like settings for inlet and outlet temperatures was used. In the RAW-PEDV-CONTROL group, PEDV RNA was present in feces at day post infection (dpi) 3 and the pigs seroconverted by dpi 14. In contrast, PEDV RNA in feces was not detected in any of the pigs in the other groups including the SD-PEDV-CONTROL group and none of the pigs had seroconverted by termination of the project at dpi 28. This work provides direct evidence that the experimental spray-drying process used in this study was effective in inactivating infectious PEDV in the plasma. Additionally, plasma collected from PEDV infected pigs at peak disease did not contain infectious PEDV. These findings suggest that the risk for PEDV transmission through commercially produced SDPP is minimal.",

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an enveloped single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus which belongs to the family Coronaviridae, was first reported in feeder and fattening pigs in the UK in 1971 (Wood, 1977) . PEDV causes an acute, highly contagious diarrhea in pigs of all ages with up to 90-95% mortality in suckling pigs in na\u00efve breeding herds (Stevenson et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2012; Temeeyasen et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013) . Outbreaks of PEDV have occurred in all pig producing areas in Europe (Song and Park, 2012) followed by introduction into Asia in the early 1990s (Kusanagi et al., 1992) . More recently, PEDV was introduced to North America and rapidly spread across farms and states causing large-scale outbreaks with high rates of morbidity and mortality Mole, 2013; Stevenson et al., 2013) . Thus far, there is no effective vaccine or specific treatment available, and the only measures to control the disease are those directed at preventing the introduction of the virus to farms (Park et al., 2011; Song and Park, 2012; Temeeyasen et al., 2013) .",

Other enveloped viruses with similar heat resistance such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and pseudorabies virus, and even more stable nonenveloped RNA viruses such as swine vesicular disease virus (Turner and Williams, 1999) have been successfully inactivated by spray-drying (Polo et al., 2005; Pujols et al., 2007) .

            "text": "The present study was designed to test the degree of inactivation of PEDV during the spray-drying process. To make sure that an appropriate positive control was utilized, plasma was spiked with a known amount of infectious PEDV. In addition, the plasma was free of PEDV antibodies to avoid potential virus neutralization prior to spray drying. When administered directly in untreated liquid form, as expected, infectious PEDV-spiked into plasma retained its infectivity and was capable of infecting the PEDV na\u00efve pigs in the RAW-PEDV-CONTROL group as determined by viral shedding in feces and seroconversion to PEDV. To further test if PEDV is capable of surviving the spray-drying process, plasma containing infectious PEDV (SD-PEDV-CONTROL) was spray-dried using a laboratory bench spray-dryer. Although PEDV RNA could be detected in the plasma powder after spray drying, none of the SD-PEDV-CONTROL pigs became PEDV infected, as evidenced by the lack of PEDV RNA in feces and no evidence of seroconversion. The PEDV-spiked spray-dried plasma powder used in this study was stored at 4 8C for seven days. A recent report on the biosafety of spray-dried plasma (Biosafety of spray dried plasma relative to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus; http://www.functionalproteins.com/ documents/news/21.pdf; Accessed on May 1, 2014) has shown that PEDV survived up to 14 days in contaminated spray-dried bovine plasma stored at 4 8C using an in-vitro model. Therefore, the storage conditions used in the present study were not detrimental to the virus viability indicating that the viral inactivation in the present study was due to the spray-drying process itself. It is worth noting that the concentration of PEDV in the plasma that was spray-dried and used for the SD-PEDV-CONTROL group was higher than the concentration in the liquid plasma used in the RAW-PEDV-CONTROL group. Together with the data obtained in the RAW-PEDV-CONTROL group, this indicates that the spray drying process inactivated the virus.",

Therefore, it has been suggested that it may not be appropriate to fully extrapolate data obtained through use of the bench-top laboratory spray dryer to the commercial spray drying processes (Thybo et al., 2008) . In general, laboratory spray dryers have less capability of viral inactivation compared with commercial spraydriers (Shen et al., 2011) . Therefore the results from the present study are encouraging as they indicate complete inactivation of infectious PEDV even under less stringent conditions supporting an overall low risk that infectious PEDV, if present, may survive the commercial spraydrying process. In the present study, the outlet temperature used was the same as suggested for spray-dried plasma production under commercial processes, as this parameter has been shown to have the single major effect on microorganism viability (Ananta et al., 2005) . Usage of different spray-drying conditions or lapses in the consistency of the processes could potentially lead to an incomplete viral inactivation and further work needs to be done to understand and perhaps improve the quality assurance of the processes utilized by the SDPP industry. Alternatively, contamination of PEDV in SDPP and by-products may occur post-processing as suggested by recovery of infectious PEDV from feed without inclusion of animal by-products (Dee et al., 2014) . Additionally, PEDV has been demonstrated to become aerosolized and transported up to 10 miles from infected sites (Alonso et al., 2014) thereby showing a great potential for wide spread and environmental contamination.",

            "text": "Although it was initially thought that enteric coronaviruses including PEDV are not associated with viremia (Saif and Heckert, 1990) , viral loads of 4.0-7.6 log 10 PEDV genome equivalent copy numbers per ml of serum have been described recently in experimentally and naturally PEDV-infected pigs (Jung et al., 2014) . In contrast, the outcomes of another study using an experimental PEDV model in young pigs suggest that detection of PEDV RNA in blood occurs sporadically and at low levels . Similarly, no PEDV RNA could be detected in serum samples of the RAW-PEDV-CONTROL pigs in the present study. Differences in the ability of the PEDV to reach the vascular system may be associated with the viral strain (Park and Shin, 2014) . Sporadic detection of viral RNA of another enteric coronavirus, feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), in blood seems to be associated with mononuclear cells that engulf the virus in the gut and subsequently gain access to the vascular system (Vogel et al., 2010) . The susceptibility of mononuclear cells to FECV is however poor and viral spread is inefficient (Rottier et al., 2005) . Rather than direct PEDV viremia, secondary contamination of blood and blood products with PEDV RNA at the slaughterhouse level, for example with fecal material, seems to be a more likely source for the observed PEDV contaminations of pooled plasma samples. This should be further investigated to improve the overall production and manufacturing processes.",

Transient detection of PEDV RNA in serum samples could be partially explained by association of PEDV with macrophages in acutely infected pigs. In the present study, there was no evidence of active PEDV infection when plasma obtained from previously PEDV infected pigs was given to the RAW-SICK group. Plasma PEDV RNA level in the pooled samples utilized for the present study was below real-time RT-PCR detection limit. Further studies are necessary to fully understand the extent and significance of PEDV RNA detection in serum of infected animals and whether the virus in the blood stream retains infectivity.",
