Despite presence of other pathogen-associated patterns (PAMP), like LPS or flagellin, no IFNbeta was produced in fibroblasts and epithelial cells lacking RIG-I upon S. typhimurium infection. In contrast, in macrophages TLR dependent recognition of bacterial PAMPs through TRIF/Myd88 overcomes RIG-I deficiency and leads to robust induction of type I interferon. We observed higher bacterial titers at early time points after infection in the cecum of S. typhimurium infected RIG-I\u00c0/\u00c0 mice, when compared to wild type animals. However, at later stages of infection, S. typhimurium overcomes the innate response leading to similar weight loss and mortality in wildtype and RIG-I\u00c0/\u00c0 mice.",

This is found only in patients with CC genotype, whereas this ratio is reduced in patients with CT genotype due to lower number of FoxP3 cells.

The liver immune response appears tightly regulated as suggested by the links between CD8 cells and CD4-FoxP3 cells, and between IL10 and FoxP3 gene expression. Introduction: . Innate immunity to RNA virus infection is triggered when the cytosolic pathogen recognition receptor RIG-I engages viral RNA in infected cells. RIG-I pathway signaling is transmitted by the RIG-I adaptor protein MAVS, which resides on mitochondria, peroxisomes, and the mitochondrial-associated membrane (MAM), a distinct membrane that links ER to mitochondria. During RNA virus infection, RIG-I is recruited into the MAM where it binds MAVS and drives the actions of a signalosome that mediates downstream induction of antiviral, proinflammatory, and immunomodulatory genes that impart control of infection and immunity. MAMtethering to mitochondria and peroxisomes coordinates MAVS localization to form a signaling synapse between membranes. The importance of the MAM within this ''innate immune synapse\" is highlighted by the fact that the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease cleaves MAVS on the MAM, but not the mitochondria, to evade immunity.",

Introduction . The balance between pro and anti-inflammatory signaling in innate immune responses to bacterial infection is especially critical in the lung. Airway epithelial cells, in addition to resident and recruited cells of immune origin, participate in what must be coordinated proinfammatory signaling in response to inhaled pathogens. The type III interferons are especially important in pulmonary infection, produced in response to viral infection and bacterial PAMPs. IFN-k is activated by and induces NF-jB signaling and promotes expression of Th1 cytokines. We postulated that common respiratory pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, would stimulate an IFN-k response and that this would have an important effect on bacterial clearance from the airway.",

            "text": "Results. In response to either P. aeruginosa PAK or USA300 MRSA on BMDCs there was a 10-fold increase in IFN-k transcript by 4 h post infection which persisted for up to 8 h; in contrast to the 1000-fold induction of IFN-b by both organisms. The IL-28R\u00c0/\u00c0 mice had significantly improved clearance of either pathogen from the airway and lung tissue (P < 0.05 for each). Consistent with the expected participation of IFN-k in NF-jB signaling, we measured decreased expression of KC, TNF and GM-CSF and increased IL-10 in the IL-28R\u00c0/ -BAL (P < 0.05), although there were no significant differences in the populations of immune cells (neutrophils, DC, macrophages) recruited to the airways of the wild type or IL-28R\u00c0/\u00c0 mice. Deleterious effects of IFN-k on bacterial clearance were confirmed by exogenous treatment of wt mice with IFN-k that significantly diminished clearance of both organisms. To address how IFN-k signaling interferes with bacterial clearance we examined the role of PDCD4 (programmed cell death protein 4) in this model system. PDCD4, which is negatively regulated by miR-21, has been shown to divergently regulate NF-jB and IL-10 signaling, consistent with the observed effects of IFN-k. At baseline there was significantly more PDCD4 expression in the wt murine lung as compared with the IL-28R\u00c0/ \u00c0 mutant and levels of expression were not significantly different at 18 h post USA300 or PAK infection, in contrast to the significant increase in PDCD4 expression in the IL-28R\u00c0/\u00c0 mice following exposure to either bacteria. To determine if PDCD4 in human airway epithelial cells is similarly regulated by IFN-k, we monitored the kinetics of PDCD4 expression in 16HBE cells noting a 10 fold induction in response to IFN-kwhich was back to baseline by 8 h. The expression of miR-21 was induced by 16-fold at 2 h post IFN-k and decreased even more briskly back to baseline levels at 4 h.",

            "text": "Conclusion. These results indicate that like IFN-b, bacterial PAMPs also activate IFNk signaling which may contribute to airway inflammation without augmenting pathogen clearance. Further dissection of the components of IFN-k regulation may provide targets to diminish the pathology associated with airway inflammation without compromising the ability to clear pathogens. Introduction. Ligation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)associated receptors in macrophages can initiate potent induction of negative regulators, including anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, signaling inhibitors SOCS3, ABIN3, A20 and transcriptional repressor Hes1 [1] . However under inflammatory conditions, the strong inhibitory pathway initiated by ITAM-bearing receptors was altered. In macrophages isolated from rheumatoid arthritis patients, as well as in blood monocytes/macrophages primed with IFN-c, ITAM-mediated induction of IL-10 and other inhibitory molecules was markedly attenuated. Here, we investigated mechanisms underlying the suppression of IFN-c on ITAM-mediated inhibitory pathway.",

However, effective knockdown of b-catenin by siRNAs had little effect on ITAM-mediated gene expression, as assessed by genome-wide microarray analysis.
