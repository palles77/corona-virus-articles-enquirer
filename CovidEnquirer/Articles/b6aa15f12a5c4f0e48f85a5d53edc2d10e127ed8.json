Human A(H7N9) cases exhibit high degrees of age and sex bias: mortality is heavily biased toward males >50 years, no deaths have been reported among individuals <25 years old, and relatively few cases documented among children or adolescents. The proportion of fatal cases (PFC) for human A(H7N9) cases as of 11 August 2013 was 32%, compared to a cumulative PFC for A(H5N1) of 83% in Indonesia and 36% in Egypt. Approximately 75% of cases of all A(H7N9) cases occurred among individuals >45 years old. Morbidity and mortality from A(H7N9) are lowest among individuals between 10 and 29 years, the age group which exhibits the highest cumulative morbidity and case fatality rates from A(H5N1). Although individuals <20 years old comprise nearly 50% of all human A(H5N1) cases, only 7% of all reported A(H7N9) cases and no deaths have been reported among individuals in this age group. Only 4% of A(H7N9) cases occurred among children < 5 years old, and only one case from the 10 to 20 year age group. Age-and sex-related differences in morbidity and mortality from emerging zoonotic diseases can provide insights into ecological, economic, and cultural factors that may contribute to the emergence and proliferation of novel zoonotic diseases in human populations.",

The majority of reported MERS-CoV patients have exhibited respiratory symptoms, and most MERS-CoV cases are hospitalized with severe ARDS, as was the case for nearly all reported influenza H7N9 cases [17] . The median age of MERS-CoV patients is 55 years (range: 2-94), versus a median for H7N9 of 60 years (range 2-91). The MERS-CoV had a male: female case ratio in those older than 60-years of 2.3-1, while that of H7N9 was 2.4-1. Only 4 of 95 (4.2%) MERS-CoV cases were individuals aged <24 years [17, 18] . More than 50% of all A(H7N9) cases had underlying conditions, and most fatal cases MERS-CoV also have pre-existing medical conditions [18] [19] [20] . While existing chronic disease conditions are recognized as a significant risk factor for human infections by A(H7N9) and MERS-CoV, this has not been the case for the A(H5N1) virus in China or eslewhere [21] . However, the cumulative PFC for MERS-CoV (47%) is more similar to that of H5N1 (59%) than that of H7N9 (22%).",
