Here, we report that bacteriophage MS2 coat protein (MS2 CP) bound and promoted the catalytic activity of Candida group I ribozyme. Cloning of the MS2-bound RNA segments showed that this protein primarily interacts with the P5ab-P5 structure. Ultraviolet cross-linking and the T1 footprinting assay further showed that MS2 binding stabilized tertiary interactions, including the conserved L9-P5 interaction, and led to a more compact core structure. This mechanism is similar to that of the yeast mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase on other group I introns, suggesting that different RNA-binding proteins may use common mechanisms to support RNA structures.",

Early studies were limited to yeast mitochondrial proteins that, when mutated, resulted in splicing deficiency phenotypes. These studies led to the discovery of Cbp2 protein which captures the native-like structure of the group I intron bI5, and of Cyt-18 protein, which stabilizes the tertiary structure of the ribozyme by binding to the P4-P6 domain [4, 11] . These two proteins are RNA-binding proteins with a general feature of binding directly to RNA and therefore stabilizing the RNA tertiary folds. Interestingly, CYT 18 also stimulates the activity of several non-cognate group I introns [12] , questioning the specificity of the action of RNA-binding proteins.",

Interestingly, all the RNA sequences bound by MS2 CP were located in the P5ab-P5 structure (Fig. 3A) . The shortest sequence was mapped to 135A to 151C, while the longest one was from sites 131A to 200C of the ribozyme RNA. It is particularly interesting to notice that the unpaired A139-A140 in J5/5a was protected from RNase A cleavage in all six clones. Because RNase A specifically cleaves the single-stranded RNA, the exclusive protection of J5/5a and P5ab harboring a number of unpaired nucleotides readily suggests that MS2 primarily binds to J5/5a-P5ab structure and protects it from RNase A digestion.",

Strikingly, G286/287 in the J8/7 junction, G256/ G257 in the P3 helix, and G245-247 in the P7 helix became strongly resistant to T1 cleavage in the presence of MS2 CP (Fig. 4A) .

The stop signals in the presence of MBP protein show similar profile and intensity as those of the no-protein control, indicating that neither does MBP protein bind to the ribozyme RNA nor alter the ribozyme structure. Strikingly, the presence of MS2 CP induced a number of unique stop signals (lane 2), including the newly appearing bands and those with increased band intensity. These induced stop signals are readily interpreted as the sites of MS2 CP-dependent cross-linking, which could be resulted from either RNA-protein cross-linking or protein-dependent tertiary RNA-RNA interactions [20, 21] .",

The cross-link sig-nals at C135-G138 of the base-paired region of P5 might not be attributable to a direct binding by MS2 CP; they may instead reflect an increased tertiary interaction with L9, because the GAAAA sequence in L9 also displayed strong cross-link signals ( Fig. 4B and  C) . The L9 GNRA tetraloop are expected to interact with the minor groove of P5 [8, 22] and this tertiary interaction is subjected to cross-linking by UV irradiation [20, 21] .

Two independent experiments were performed and one representative gel is shown here. Hydrolysis of the Candida group I ribozyme was performed at 6 mM (C) and 2 mM (D) MgCl 2 , and then reaction aliquots were taken for gel fractionation after 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min of hydrolysis at 37\u00b0C. (E) The reacted fraction was plotted against the reaction time by fitting curves to a single exponential, and the observed rate constant and the maximal reacted fraction deduced from the curve are shown. ribozyme activity was dependent on the presence of both P5ab and P9, as reflected by the diminishment of such effect when either of this structure element was deleted (Supplementary Figure S3 ).",

To circumvent this problem, direct hydroxyl-radical cleavage assay has been used to map the protein-binding sites on some group I introns [24] , in which series of protein mutants containing a single cysteine at different positions needed to be constructed, expressed, and purified. In this study, the protein-protected RNA cloning (PRC) method has been developed to successfully identify the MS2-binding site on the Candida group I ribozyme RNA. In principle, the RNA bound by MS2 CP is protected from nuclease digestion and can be successfully cloned after RT-PCR amplification. This method is cost-effective and easy to be performed, which provides an attractive alternative to identify RNA sequences bound by RNA-binding proteins in vitro.",

MS2 interacts with the cognate RNA hairpin asymmetrically. The adenine at the \u00c04 position in the terminal loop and the bulged purine at \u00c010 in the paired region establish four and three hydrogen bonds with some threonine and serine residues in the MS2 protein (Fig. 3D) [26] . In the Candida P5ab structure, two symmetrically bulged Gs are present in P5a, and one recovered sequence contains only G141-C152 in P5a, indicating that this side of P5a may directly contact MS2 protein and that G144 might represent the \u00c010 purine, resembling the base-paired structure in the F6 aptamer (Fig. 3B) . We also noted that P5a could form an alternative structure, with one bulged G144 pairing with U185 and the other bulged G184 pairing with U145. This alternative pairing ending up with a single bulged A143 after the first two base pairs in P5a represents a conserved paired structure for the MS2 protein targets (Fig. 4C) . Interestingly, previous research has shown that A-4 is essential for MS2 recognition, and base substitution at this position reduces the dissociation constant of the protein binding to 670 nM [13] , consistent with the lack of a conserved A(-4) in the P5ab-P5 structure and a similar low binding affinity.",

The hnRNP A1 protein, HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein (NCp7), coronavirus nucleocapsid protein, and the GAPDH protein have been shown to stimulate hammerhead ribozyme catalysis. And La, hnRNP K, and hnRNP I are reported to possess RNA chaperone activity [4] . This study shows that MS2 CP, a bacteriophage protein, can bind to a peripheral structure of a group I ribozyme, which in turn stabilizes the core structure and promotes the activity of the ribozyme. The action mechanism of this protein is strikingly similar to that of the CYT-18 protein on its cognate and non-cognate group I ribozymes. These findings support a model that different RNA-binding proteins may use common mechanisms to promote RNA structures. This model is supported by the notion that splicing factors without host specificity are present to facilitate the group I intron splicing in vivo. For example, the Tetrahymena group I intron splices in Escherichia coli and human cells as efficiently as in its natural host [27, 28] .",
