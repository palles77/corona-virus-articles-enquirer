Similar to other coronaviruses, the 5 0 two thirds of the IBV genome encodes two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, and the latter is an extension product of pp1a as a result of a \u00c01 frameshifting (Almazan et al., 2004; Brierley et al., 1989) . The remaining one third of the genome encodes the structural proteins and group-specific ORFs, including spike glycoprotein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane Veterinary Microbiology 162 (2013) Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain H120 was successfully rescued as infectious clone by reverse genetics. Thirteen 1.5-2.8 kb fragments contiguously spanning the virus genome were amplified and cloned into pMD19-T. Transcription grade complete length cDNA was acquired by a modified ''No See'm'' ligation strategy, which employed restriction enzyme Bsa I and BsmB I and ligated more than two fragments in one T4 ligase reaction. The full-length genomic cDNA was transcribed and its transcript was transfected by electroporation into BHK-21 together with the transcript of nucleocapsid gene. At 48 h post transfection, the medium to culture the transfected BHK-21 cells was harvested and inoculated into 10-days old SPF embryonated chicken eggs (ECE) to replicate the rescued virus. After passage of the virus in ECE five times, the rescued H120 virus (R-H120) was successfully recovered. R-H120 was subsequently identified to possess the introduced silent mutation site in its genome. Some biological characteristics of R-H120 such as growth curve, EID50 and HA titers, were tested and all of them were very similar to its parent strain H120. In addition, both R-H120 and H120 induced a comparable titer of HA inhibition (HI) antibody in immunized chickens and also provided up to 85% of immune protection to the chickens that were challenged with Mass41 IBV strain. The present study demonstrated that construction of infectious clone from IBV vaccine strain H120 is possible and IBV-H120 can be use as a vaccine vector for the development of novel vaccines through molecular recombination and the modified reverse genetics approach.",

In addition, IBV also encodes a set of accessory proteins of unknown function that may be absent in some strains and not essential for virus replication in vitro (Armesto et al., 2009; Casais et al., 2005; Hodgson et al., 2006; Youn et al., 2005) . The reverse genetic system for IBV was firstly established using vaccinia vector (Casais et al., 2001) . Subsequently, a more elegant protocol to obtain viral infectious RNA was developed. In this system, full-length viral cDNA was assembled in vitro by orderly ligating viral genomic cDNA fragments and directly used as DNA template for reverse transcription of viral infectious RNA. The new technique was successfully applied to the studies on the role of accessory genes in viral replication (Youn et al., 2005) , virulence determinant of Beaudette strain (Fang et al., 2007) and the relationship between S gene and tissue tropism of the virus Casais et al., 2001 Casais et al., , 2003 Casais et al., , 2005 Youn et al., 2005) . However, to the best of our knowledge, all existing reverse genetics systems for IBV were based on Vero cell-adapted Beaudette strain, which was considered to be poorly immunogenic and never used as a vaccine strain (Geilhausen et al., 1973) . Therefore, application of the reverse genetics techniques to other strains including vaccine strains could improve the technique on modification of viral genome and provide a powerful tool for novel vaccine development.",

Each DNA fragment was amplified from cDNA templates by PCR using KOD plus polymerase (Toyobo, Japan). PCR primer pairs used to amplify genomic regions are listed in Table 1 . PCR amplification of cDNA fragments was performed in the following conditions: denaturation at 94 8C for 5 min, 25 cycles of 94 8C for 30 s, 55 8C for 30 s, and 72 8C for 2-6 min depending on the size of the products and final extension at 72 8C for 10 min. The PCR products were isolated from agarose gels and TA-cloned into pMD19-T vector (TaKaRa, Japan), according to the manufacturer's directions. The entire nucleocapsid (N) ORF, including the 3 0 -UTR, was amplified by RT-PCR from total RNA extracted from H120-infected allantoic fluid, and the RT-PCR product was also cloned into pMD19-T vector. In order to transcribe RNA by using T7 RNA polymerase, T7 promoter sequence was incorporated to 5 0 end primers of F1 and N-3 0 fragments. In addition, a silent nucleotide change of A to T at position 20,132 nt was incorporated in to F10F primer as a molecular marker. To determine the consensus clone, two to four independent clones of each amplicon were sequenced by Sangon Biological Engineering Technology & Services Co., Ltd. Each amplicon that represents the consensus sequence of IBV-H120 was then released from cloning vector by restriction enzyme digestion and recovered for construction of the full-length IBV genome in vitro. Briefly, the plasmid carrying F1 amplicon was digested with Sal I and Nci I, and treated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (CIAP: TaKaRa), before digesting with the BsmB I; the plasmid with F13 amplicon was digested with Xho I, CIAP treated and digested with BsmBI; the plasmids carrying amplicons F2 and F10 were digested with Nci I and BsmB I; and the other plasmids inserted amplicon F3, F4, F5, F6, F7, F8, F9, F11 and F12, were digested with BsaI. All the digested plasmids were separated on 0.8% agarose gels and the bands corresponding to each amplicon were cut from the gels and purified with QIAquick gel extraction kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA). The cDNA amplicons were ligated orderly with T4 DNA ligase as following: (1) ligation of the amplicons into four fragments (F1 + F2 + F3, F4 + F5 + F6, F7 + F8 + F9, and F10 + F11 + F12 + F13) in equal mole ratio and recovering the appropriately sized four fragments from 1% agarose gels and (2) ligation of the four fragments into full-length IBV genome (Fig. 1) . The final ligation product was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), precipitated with ethanol, and detected by electrophoresis on 0.4% agarose gel.",

Briefly, 30 ml of transcription reaction with a 1:1 ratio of GTP to cap analog was sequentially incubated at 37 8C for 120 min. A similar reaction was performed for the N transcripts, which were generated by using a linearized pMD19-T-N-3 0 containing the IBV N gene and the 3 0 -UTR region as templates. A 1:2 ratio of GTP to cap analog was used for the transcription of IBV N gene (Fang et al., 2007; Youn et al., 2005) . In the same time, BHK-21 cells were grown on monolayers to 80% confluence, treated with trypsin, washed with cold DEPC-treated PBS twice, and resuspended in DEPC-treated PBS at a concentration of 10 7 cells/ml. RNA transcripts were added to 600 ml of BHK-21 cell suspension in microfuge tubes on ice, gently pipetted and transferred to electroporation cuvettes. Three consecutive electrical pulses of 850 V at 25 AF were given, using the Gene Pulser Xcell TM Electroporation System (Bio-Rad).

After 48 h, the virus containing medium was collected and inoculated into the 10-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs. After 5 passages in ECE, allantoic fluid was harvested according to the previous description (Cavanagh, 1983) . To differentiate the rescued viruses from the parental viruses, viral RNAs were extracted from allantoic fluid (R-H120 and parental H120) as described previously. RT-PCR was performed with selected primer pairs (5 0 -aatataagacagagcacaag-3 0 , 5 0 -ctgtcatacaaagcagcactaca-3 0 ) to amplify the fragment consisting of the silent nucleotide change of A to T at position 20,132 nt.

For the purposes of studying the mechanisms of pathogenesis, or building transfer vectors, so far, Casais et al. (2001) , Youn et al. (2005) and Fang et al. (2007) established the reverse genetic system for Vero cell-adapted Beaudette strain. After that, this reverse genetic system for Vero cell-adapted Beaudette strain are used to research the pathogenicity, tissue tropism and functionality of accessory gene of the IBV (Armesto et al., 2009 (Armesto et al., , 2011 Britton et al., 2006; Casais et al., 2003; Hodgson et al., 2006) . Previous reverse genetic system set for coronavirus was assembly of a genomic length cDNA from 6 to 8 contiguous cDNA subclones in size 3-7 kb (Fang et al., 2007; Youn et al., 2005) . Although this segmentation strategy can decrease the number of cDNA fragments and is easier to link to full-lengthen cDNA, it is difficult to get the longer PCR product with correct sequence and clone these cDNA fragments. In addition, the recombined plasmid containing larger fragments may be harmful to host bacteria, resulting some of them could not replicate in Escherichia coli host cells. In order to solve these problems, certain modifications for assembling of IBV genomic RNA in vitro were made to improve the efficiency of generating full-length cDNA. In this study, two improvements for assembly of full-length viral genome were applied. At first, the IBV genome was cloned as thirteen 1.5-2.8 kb fragments. The shortened length of cDNA fragments made them easier to clone, with less sequence mutation in each fragment and more stable in bacteria. Secondly, three or four fragments were ligated in one T4 DNA ligase reaction to reduce the number of recovery times which was negative correlated to DNA recovery rate from agarose gels.",

In addition, the 27.6 kb genome of H120 as a vaccine vector can be recombined with larger pathogenic antigen gene compared with 15 kb Newcastle disease virus vaccine vector, which was a vector used presently to express different pathogenic antigen genes as vaccine to protect the immunized animals from correspondence pathogen's challenge (DiNapoli et al., 2007; Nakaya et al., 2001; Veits et al., 2006) . It would make the procedure of constructing reverse genetics system labor intensive if a continuous cell line could not be used in infectious RNA transfection and rescued virus replication. In our study, the continuous cell line, BHK-21, was applied to generating modified virus after electroporation, indicating that BHK-21 can be utilized to rescue virus from infectious RNA although BHK-21 was never used to replicate H120 virus before. At present, most IBV strains replicate in primary cells like CK and CEK and do not adapt to continuous cell lines (Casais et al., 2003) . Therefore, in vitro assembly strategy is applicable to IBV strains that were not adapted to the commonly used continuous cell lines through the established approach in the present study. It is interesting to find that the rescued virus R-H120 and H120 viruses cannot efficiently replicate in BHK21 and make the cells emerge obvious CPE, but R-H120 do rescue from BHK21 cell. In next step, the S gene of H120 may be modified by reverse genetics to find out BHK21 adapted H120 that may reveal the information on cell tropism of the virus.",
