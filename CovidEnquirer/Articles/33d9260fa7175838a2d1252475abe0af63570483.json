Serial viral load titers, cytokine levels and host genetic factors were evaluated in an attempt to understand this unusual and lethal outcome. The patient's high-titer vaccine viremia and possibly related minor genetic anomalies provide clues to exploring the etiology of YEL-AVD.",

Since the late 1990s, 36 cases of YEL-AVD, characterized by multiorgan failure, have been recorded worldwide following administration of vaccine manufactured in the United States, France, Brazil and China (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] , unpublished data) [3, 4] . The risk of YEL-AVD is about three per million doses administered, but is highest among people over 60 years of age and those with a history of thymic disease [3, 5, 6] . The incidence of YEL-AVD is 1.1 per 100,000 doses in people aged 60-69 years and 3.2 per 100,000 doses in people 70 years and older [5] . However, nine of the recorded cases were less than 30 years of age and none had thymic disease (CDC, unpublished data) [7] [8] [9] . The recognition of YEL-AVD coincided with decreased use of pre-travel immunoglobulin to prevent hepatitis A, leading to conjecture that it may have been prevented in the past by the fortuitous coadministration of antibody against YF virus (YFV) [2] . Other hypotheses to explain YEL-AVD include genetic host susceptibility and generation of rare mutations during replication in the host that increase virulence [10] [11] [12] [13] .",

Chest radiograph showed pleural effusions (Fig. 1 ). Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed tamponade-like physiology secondary to the surrounding pleural effusions. Pleural fluid cultures and HIV serology were negative. Anuric renal failure ensued requiring hemodialysis, but labile blood pressure precluded fluid removal. A single 45 g dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was administered. Hydrocortisone was initiated at 50 mg intravenously every 6 h. Laboratory parameters progressively worsened (Table 1) . Nine days after vaccination, she developed hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Repeat chest radiograph showed dense bilateral consolidation. Nitric oxide therapy was initiated. The following day, vasopressors were started for hypotension unresponsive to fluid resuscitation. High frequency oscillatory ventilation, followed by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, was initiated for refractory hypoxemia. Repeat transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a markedly depressed ejection fraction of 15%. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were started in consultation with the infectious disease service with convincing evidence of a bacterial infection in the pleural fluid. Eleven days after YF vaccination, the patient died. Blood cultures drawn immediately prior to death grew group C beta-hemolytic Streptococcus. Pleural fluid samples grew the same Streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus. Postmortem examination revealed multiorgan failure and diffuse hemorrhage consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (Fig. 2) . Microscopy of the lungs showed diffuse alveolar damage with hemorrhage and acute necrotizing bronchopneumonia. Post-mortem blood cultures grew S. aureus.",

Although some of the sequence differences from a reference vaccine strain were also detected in an isolate from a similar case of YEL-AVD in Spain, two of these nucleotide changes were silent and one was in a non-coding region. These changes seem unlikely to affect virulence, and other people vaccinated with the same lots did not develop YEL-AVD. Clonal sequencing of virus from an earlier YEL-AVD case revealed a mutated vaccine substrain, and mutated virus was also isolated from a child with encephalitis following YF vaccination [4, 18] . Since clonal sequencing of the isolate from this patient was not done, it is possible that a minor mutant substrain altered the overall virulence of the vaccination without altering the consensus sequence. However, viral sequences from other YEL-AVD cases have not suggested loss of attenuation, and YEL-AVD has occurred with vaccine from various lots, strain subtypes and manufacturers [3, 8] .",

Two of these were in coding regions, while the other was in an intron splicing site. At least five different OAS1 isoforms are generated by alternative splicing. The p42 and p44 isoforms are produced by all genotypes. The A-allele in OAS1 intron 5 SNP rs10774671 produces p48 and p52, while the G-allele produces p46 [19] . Since the patient was GG-homozygous, she would have produced p46. Computer modeling suggests that p46 may have impaired enzymatic activity [20] . The patient was homozygous for the G-allele of SNP rs3741981 in exon 3 which causes an amino acid substitution in all the OAS1 isoforms. The G-allele of this SNP was previously reported to be associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome in a Vietnamese population [21] . Homozygosity for the OAS1 3 terminal exon A-insertion (rs11352835) produces a frame shift and premature translation termination of the p44 transcript. Although not currently supported by experimental data, the three minor alleles in the OAS1 gene and the AAhomozygosity in OAS2 SNP rs15895 leading to truncation of the OAS2 protein could have had an adverse effect on possible OAS-mediated anti-flaviviral activities that contributed to the abnormally high virus levels. It is unlikely that the mutations in PKR affected protein function but mutations in other candidate genes not evaluated might also have influenced the response to YF vaccination. Similar host factors may be involved in atypically severe manifestations of different flavivirus infections [22] .",

This patient's viremia peaked on post-vaccination day 6 at 1000 times higher than expected following a brief remission and then intensification of her symptoms [2] . By that time, multiorgan failure had developed, likely mediated by inflammatory cytokines, in a clinical pattern similar to that seen in wild-type YF, except that the virus is usually cleared in wild-type infection by day 6 [2] . One dose of IVIG was given on post-vaccination day 8 without obvious clinical benefit.

However, because of the potential for extremely rare severe adverse events, the vaccine should only be given to travelers whose itinerary requires vaccination. The etiologic mechanism of YEL-AVD remains unclear and may vary across cases but a genetic susceptibility based on OAS gene abnormalities might have played a role in this case. Suspected cases of YEL-AVD should be promptly reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Surveillance System at 1-800-822-7967 or http://vaers.hhs.gov. Collection of whole blood and serum from patients with suspected YEL-AVD will aid future investigations of this puzzling and devastating condition.",
