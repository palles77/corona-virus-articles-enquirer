Their investigations, reported in Zhou et al. [1] , began with next-generation sequencing of nucleic acids in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids of diseased patients. From the sequence data, a novel coronavirus was identified and provisionally named 2019-nCoV. The 2019-nCoV RNA virus genome is closely related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV that emerged in human populations in 2003-2004 to cause epidemic disease and to several SARS-related CoVs in bats that are known to have the potential for human infection [2] . Thus, 2019-nCoV is now renamed 'SARS-CoV-2'. It is alarming that SARS-CoV-2 has expanded far beyond that of the previous 2003 SARS-CoV, spreading to over 40 countries and infecting over 80 000 individuals as of 25 February 2020. The infection is associated with a SARS-like disease [3] , with a case fatality rate at 3.4%. The SARS-CoV-2/coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has been designated a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization.",

Subsequent detailed clinical investigations demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 is detected within 1-2 days after patient symptoms, peaking 4-6 days later and clearing within 18 days [4] . Seroconversion was evident at that time, with abundant virus-specific IgG measured approximately 20 days after disease onset. These are the findings that help to define transmissibility periods and inform public health authorities on appropriate quarantine measures.",

These findings harken back to the earlier SARS-CoV, which also utilizes both human and animal ACE2 proteins as receptors and exhibits a zoonotic distribution that matches its binding to the ACE2 receptor orthologs [5] .

For SARS-related CoVs, addressing this question amounts to identifying those animal CoVs that bind human ACE2 receptors. Structural bioinformatics approaches are helpful here, because even before the Zhou et al. report [1] , insights made in silico accurately predicted that SARS-CoV-2 spikes bind human ACE2 [6] . Surveillance methods using cell culture Trends in Immunology, Month 2020, Vol. xx, No. xx 1 Trends in Immunology TREIMM 1662 No. of Pages 3 models will further address this question, when testing human cell infection with SARS-related animal CoVs and paying close attention to those viruses isolated from wildlife in close proximity with humans. Which CoVs transmit human disease? Recent structural and biochemical analyses of SARS-CoV-2 S proteins [7] begin to address this question. The receptor-binding domains on the SARS-CoV-2 S proteins bind with high affinity to human ACE2 [7] , which may explain the facile transmissibility of this virus. However, additional host interactions may also correlate with transmission and disease, and Zhou et al. noted unique features on a separate (N-terminal) domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S proteins that may confer binding to alternative host-cell receptors [1] . Alternative host cell interactions by these N-terminal domains warrant consideration, as it is known that analogous domains on several human",

Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 furin substrate site is likely to facilitate the priming cleavage step, which sensitizes S proteins to the subsequent activating cleavages occurring on susceptible target cells, and facilitates virus entry and infection, as depicted in Figure 1 .

            "text": "Quarantine measures are in place to limit the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, but the risk of a global pandemic is real. The development of effective vaccines and antiviral drugs is a priority to reduce the burden of this virus. An immediate challenge is to construct SARS-CoV-2 S-based vaccines that display conserved epitopes and elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies as well as virusspecific T cell responses. Similar daunting tasks lie ahead in identifying safe and effective drugs that suppress SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication and in making recommendations for their clinical use. If given too late, they may not modify the disease course, even if virus loads are diminished. Committed research communities can and will build from the foundational knowledge that is now in place and respond appropriately to these challenges. Subsequently, surface proteases cleave S2, the fusion-mediating subunit of S, which triggers a series of conformational changes that result in fusion between the viral envelope and the target cell membrane. Features of SARS-CoV-2 that may facilitate human infection include: (1) S1B receptor-binding motifs (RBMs) (in green) that bind orthologous ACE2 receptors; (2) a S1A domain that may confer additional host interactions; and (3) a furin protease cleavage substrate that may confer heightened sensitivity to host protease cleavages [9] . Antiviral antibodies (lower-left inset) prevent infection by: (a) binding S1B RBMs, blocking receptor access; (b) binding distal to RBMs, sterically interfering; (c) binding S1A, possibly preventing alternative attachment to distinct receptors; and (d) binding S2, arresting membrane fusion. Attractive antiviral compounds include protease inhibitors [10] , which deactivate membrane fusion triggering and suppress virus entry.
