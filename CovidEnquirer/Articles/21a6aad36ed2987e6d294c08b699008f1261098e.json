Studies support the use of steroids for the treatment of exacerbations of COPD and acute asthma, as both conditions are increasingly recognized as infl ammatory syndromes. 1,2 Short courses of systemic steroids have been shown to improve spirometric and clinical outcomes in patients with COPD exacerbations, although patients with documented viral infections have not been studied. 3,4 Precipitants of exacerbations of COPD and asthma include infection, environmental irritants, and allergens. Although corticosteroids reduce infl ammation, long-term use has clear detrimental Rationale: Systemic glucocorticosteroids (steroids) are commonly prescribed for patients with exacerbations of COPD during acute viral infections such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The effects of short-term high-dose steroid treatment on viral load and adaptive immunity to RSV have not been examined in adults. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to measure peak viral load and duration of viral shedding, serum and nasal cytokines, RSV-specifi c antibody response, and lymphocyte subsets in patients admitted to the hospital with RSV infection and to compare patients treated with steroids to patients untreated with steroids.",

Those who received steroids more frequently wheezed and were less often febrile. There were no serious adverse events related to steroids and no signifi cant differences in peak viral load, duration of RSV shedding, nasal cytokines, or lymphocyte subsets in patients treated with steroids and patients untreated with steroids. Antibody responses to RSV were slightly blunted in the steroid-treated group. Conclusions: Short courses of systemic steroids in patients hospitalized with RSV infection did not affect viral load or shedding. Humoral immunity may be mildly diminished, and thus potential benefi ts of systemic steroids must be balanced against potential risks.",

[5] [6] [7] [8] Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common winter virus that infects persons of all ages and is associated with wheezing, especially in young children. 9 In children with RSV-related bronchiolitis and wheezing, systemic corticosteroids have been studied and found to provide no signifi cant clinical benefi t. [10] [11] [12] In adults, the virus has been implicated as a cause of COPD and asthma exacerbations, yet is rarely specifi cally diagnosed in clinical practice.

Therefore, we took advantage of an ongoing study of the pathogenesis of RSV disease in adults to address these issues.",

No signifi cant differences between steroidtreated and steroid-untreated subjects at any of the time points were noted regarding the total percentage of B cells (% CD19 1 ), CD27 1 memory B cells, antibody secreting cells (ASC), or plasmablasts ( Fig 3 ) . Additionally, there were no signifi cant differences in the fraction of CD3 1 T cells, monocytes, CD4 and CD8 T cells (naive and memory), and natural killer cells (subsets of CD56 1 CD16hi and CD56hi) ( Fig 4 ) .",

No episodes of severe hyperglycemia, avascular bone necrosis, or steroidinduced psychosis were observed during the hospitalization or 1-month follow-up period. However, it is important to note that our study was not powered to detect important clinical steroid-related adverse events. Given the importance of cellular immunity for viral clearance and the recognized effects of longterm steroid use, we were surprised that peak RSV viral loads and duration of viral shedding were not increased in the steroid-treated group. 20 This fi nding may refl ect the relatively brief course of systemic steroids received by study participants. Although steroids exert an antiinfl ammatory effect, no uniform trend was detected in serum or nasal cytokine levels in patients receiving steroids.",

A substantial reduction in circulating lymphocytes can be demonstrated almost immediately upon injection of hydrocortisone in animal studies, with no further effect of increased dose or duration . 22 Lymphopenia is reversible but lasts throughout the period of exposure. Steroids also inhibit T-cell activation, lymphocyte proliferation, and T helper 1/T helper 2 regulation. 21 Given the known effects of steroids on the immune system, the lack of signifi cant differences in lymphocyte numbers and subsets in our steroid-treated subjects day 28 post illness. Admission absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) prior to steroid administration were similar (1.1 \u03ee 0.5 3 10 3 / m L vs 1.2 \u03ee 0.7 3 10 3 / m L) in the steroid-treated and -untreated groups, respectively. Notably, 31% of the steroid-treated group (of whom two were receiving steroids prior to admission) and 46% of the untreated group had an ALC of , 1.0 3 10 3 / m L at presentation to the hospital. For those receiving steroids who had repeat measurements, the mean ALC was 0.8 \u03ee 0.5 3 10 3 / m L at 24 h, 1.2 \u03ee 0.7 3 10 3 / m L may have been preferentially affected by steroid administration. Our study is limited by the small sample size, the lack of randomization, and the restriction to one type of viral infection. Because steroids were more commonly used in patients with COPD, which is an infl ammatory condition, the effects of steroids on infl ammatory markers and immune function may have been diffi cult to discern given the unequal distribution of patients with COPD in the analysis groups. Although it is reasonable to presume steroid effects would be similar for other respiratory viruses, RSV has unique immunomodulatory effects, and, therefore, our fi ndings may not be broadly applicable. [26] [27] [28] In conclusion, a short course of systemic corticosteroids in patients hospitalized with acute RSV infection was not associated with major deleterious is puzzling. However, very few data are available on the immune affects of steroids in acutely ill patients, particularly those with viral infections. Lymphopenia is associated with a number of acute viral infections, such as infl uenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. 23, 24 It is noteworthy that many of the patients in this study were lymphopenic at the time of presentation, and thus it is possible that RSV infection induces signifi cant immunologic perturbations that may complicate interpretation of a steroid effect.",

Although differences were only statistically signifi cant in serum-neutralizing titers against group A virus and nasal antibody to the F protein, it is likely that a larger sample size would have yielded signifi cant differences in other parameters as well. High levels of serum and nasal RSV antibody have been shown to be protective from infection and severe disease in adults, although a specifi c protective antibody titer is not known. 19, 25 Therefore, lower postinfection titers may leave steroid-treated patients more susceptible to future RSV exposures. However, the absolute differences in postinfection antibody titers we observed were relatively small, making the clinical implications of these fi ndings uncertain. The diminished antibody response in the steroid group was not explained by a signifi cant reduction in the number of B lymphocytes, ASCs, or CD4 1 T-cell lymphocytes. However, it is possible that function or activation was impaired despite no discernible difference in cell numbers or subsets. In addition, we did not measure RSV-specifi c T-cell responses or ASC, which side effects. Since specifi c respiratory viral infections, with the exception of infl uenza, are rarely diagnosed in adults, and steroids are commonly prescribed for acute exacerbations of COPD, these data are reassur-ing. A modestly diminished humoral response may predispose patients to future RSV infections, but this risk must be balanced with the immediate antiinfl ammatory effects and potential clinical benefi ts.",
