Screening programs developed through a public health perspective have as the primary focus the health of the community, while screening programs coming from a genetics viewpoint consider the individual's rights to be paramount. Hence, the philosophy behind the consent process can be different. This is illustrated by the newborn screening program. From a public health perspective, screening newborns to prevent a serious disorder such as congenital hypothyroidism, with its associated severe intellectual impairment, can lead to important clinical outcomes. The screening test itself poses no risk to the newborn (compared to, for example, some vaccinations) and the benefits are significant. Therefore, what type of consent process is needed? The options vary from no consent (if newborn screening is mandated by law) to an opt-out consent process to a fully informed written consent (more on consent in Chapter 10) . Some argue that informed consent is essential because the parent(s) must be engaged to ensure they will provide regular supplementation for congenital hypothyroidism in an affected child. Others would say that the health implications of an affected child for parents and society make screening the highest priority. Less seems to be written about the child and who protects his or her right to a healthy life. Different arguments based on a public health versus a genetics approach are possible [4] .",

Tay Sachs disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder of childhood. It is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Since the early 1970s, individuals at risk of having FIGURE 6.1 Progression of disease with burden (Y axis) plotted against time (X axis). Three different disorders (green, red and yellow) develop over four time periods with gradual increase in burden of disease over this time. Ideally, detection of disease onset should occur at the earliest phase (1) rather than waiting until the burden is such that treatment becomes very difficult (phase 4). Some disorders lead to significant burden of disease (green) while others move along at a relatively lower level of activity (yellow). Preventive steps should be available for all four phases with the goal being to push back from 4 to 3 to 2 and ideally 1 to optimize treatment outcomes. DNA testing (screening) plays an important part in this push-back as it has the potential to detect genetic mutations that predispose to disease (germline DNA) or early signs of disease perhaps in somatic cell DNA in tumors (phases 2 or 3). While the focus is on DNA one should not forget that developments in other omics (particularly proteomics, metabolomics or epigenomics) can identify changes that assist earlier diagnosis. [3] .",

As a result, the incidence of Tay Sachs disease has been reduced without the societal problems that developed following the implementation of population screening for sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease is an autosomal recessive disorder with around 100 million carriers worldwide, and 2 million in the USA, most of whom are African Americans. There can be considerable morbidity and mortality associated with those who are homozygous affected, although the ultimate outcome is not entirely genetic in origin, as environmental factors are important (more on this in Chapter 2). The US-based sickle cell screening program, which was also started in the early 1970s, targeted the at-risk African American population. The initial version of this program produced more harm than good. Results led to a lowering of self-esteem, overprotection by parents and discrimination. The discrimination came from employers, insurance companies, health insurers and potential spouses. Why did the two screening programs produce different outcomes?",

Another contrast between the two programs was the close community consultation undertaken prior to testing for Tay Sachs. Because of the problems associated with sickle cell screening, changes were made, including the removal of legal compulsion to be screened and improved counseling and education facilities. These enabled more successful testing to be pursued. Experiences with these programs illustrate the necessity for counseling and public education to explain the significance of mass screening results as key ethical considerations in design.

They were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1985 for their work. Once the LDLR gene for this disorder was isolated, DNA tests for a variety of purposes (diagnosis, prediction and screening) could be developed.",

Therefore, DNA sequencing is needed and any changes found are not necessarily pathogenic in nature, but can be variants of unknown significance (Chapter 3). Mutations in other genes can also produce a similar clinical picture (phenotype). These include APOB, ARH and PCSK9 which interfere with the cholesterol pathway. Finally, environmental factors such as diet, smoking and hormones also impact on the cholesterol level. Thus, the costs and considerable work involved would need to be balanced against the clinical benefits of earlier diagnosis for individuals, families and the broader community.",

In 2008 NICE (the UK's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) published guidelines for a new approach to the treatment and diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia, which included personalized medicine through DNA testing of individuals and at-risk family members detected by cascade testing. In the Netherlands there is an ongoing, community-based, familial hypercholesterolemia screening service run by specialized nurses. It has produced some impressive detection rates which are expected to reduce morbidity and mortality in the longer term. The NICE guidelines allow a similar approach in other countries.

Multidrug resistant TB (defined as infections that are resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin) is emerging globally, particularly in India and China. Cases of extensively drugresistant TB now exist, meaning that TB is also resistant to a number of the second line anti-TB drugs. Failure to detect resistant cases of TB is the rule rather than the exception, particularly where laboratory resources are limited.

These could function to protect the host from viral infection, and possibly as a source or natural reservoir for the virus to persist and transmit. However, it is now apparent that it is not only retroviruses that can integrate a copy of their RNA into the host's somatic and germline genome, which is the necessary first step before replication can occur. The genome of some bees has been shown to contain sequences from a positive (\ue031) strand RNA Dicistroviridae that infects insects. These bees are resistant to infection by the virus. Following this observation, a comparative bioinformatics study of genomic sequences from 48 vertebrate species using sequence data from non-retroviruses containing single-stranded (ss) RNA genomes was undertaken. Surprisingly, it was shown that about half the vertebrates had integrated non-retrovirus sequences into their genomes. The next unexpected finding was that these integrations came mostly from two groups of RNA viruses from the negative (\ue032) strand RNA Mononegavirales order. These were either Ebola and Marburg viruses -Filoviridae family associated with lethal hemorrhagic fevers -or Bornavirus -Bornaviridae family are associated with neurological and psychiatric disorders which can be fatal. The vertebrates that had the integrations suggested these events had occurred over 40 million years ago. Therefore, the conservation of sequences coding for virus-like proteins is thought to have some selective advantage, possibly increasing the host's resistance to infection. Conversely, continued integration and persistence might provide viruses with a natural reservoir for future infections. An example would be bats, which are now thought to be natural reservoirs for the Ebola and Marburg viruses. Sequences from these viruses are detectable in some bats with some having open reading frames [19] .",

Previously, blood transfusion services based their donor and blood screening programs on detecting antibodies or antigens in the donor or blood supply. However, this has proved to be inadequate, and an important addition to the screening protocols is the use of PCR to identify viral DNA or RNA. The advantages of a NAT include higher sensitivity and greater reliability during the window period -which is the time between a blood donor becoming infectious and donor screening tests becoming positive, i.e. seroconversion has occurred. The use of NAT, better serologic-based assays and more effective regulatory controls have made contemporary blood products considerably safer.

Prusiner who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1997 for his work on prions. The important components of prion disease include the PRNP gene and its cellular product PrP c (prion protein cellular) which can become the infectious protein product PrP Sc (prion protein scrapie). The normal PrP c is a cell surface glycoprotein found in a wide range of animals, having a function that as yet remains unknown. PrP c needs to change its conformation to its isoform PrP Sc to be infectious. No nucleic acid is involved in this process, highlighting the novel way in which prion disease arises and is propagated [28] . The disease leads to widespread neurodegeneration with cognitive and motor impairment. It is fatal and there is no treatment (Box 6.3).

In 1996, the emergence of variant CJD (vCJD) in humans is thought to have arisen from transmission across the species of the BSE agent. vCJD is characterized by an early age of onset (Figure 6 .3). Mutations in the PRNP gene account for the inherited forms of CJD. However, in the vast majority of sporadic cases, there are no detectable DNA mutations, and the change from PrP c to the abnormal PrP Sc is thought to occur because of somatic mutations or other, as yet unknown genetic or environmental factors. Risk factors for developing vCJD include young age, residence in the United Kingdom especially between 1985 and 1990, and intriguingly, homozygosity for a codon 129 polymorphism in the PRNP gene. At this position there is either a methionine or a BOX 6.3 two other prion-related diseases. The most recently described is vCJD which is thought to have occurred as a result of direct animal to human spread through contaminated beef products. Now there is evidence for human to human spread via transplants or blood products.",

In normal individuals, the combinations of methionine/methionine, methionine/valine and valine/valine are present. However, in patients with vCJD, the homozygous methionine is always found, suggesting that this may lead to genetic predisposition. Most patients developing iatrogenic CJD after receiving pituitary extracts for growth hormone are also homozygous for methionine. If this is correct, some have hypothesized that a second wave of vCJD will occur in the future involving those who are methionine/ valine heterozygotes or homozygotes for the valine allele because a longer incubation period is needed to develop prion disease without the additional genetic risk factor. Other less well characterized polymorphisms in this gene have been detected and may represent additional genetic modifiers [28] .

In 1997, the first cases of human infection from exposure to sick birds or their droppings were reported in Hong Kong, indicating that this virus subtype had jumped the species barrier. Eighteen patients were admitted to hospital and six died. Fortunately, the timely culling of over a million chickens controlled this particular outbreak. Today, H5N1 still causes outbreaks in chickens, and sporadic human infections continue to be reported, with a mortality of over 50%. In contrast to H1N1 swine flu and SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) that have been spread from human to human and through travel, the H5N1 bird flu remains relatively contained because spread is predominantly through chickens or other birds.",

Avian flu in chickens (H5N1) is a particularly virulent type that can kill rapidly and causes widespread organ damage. Fortunately, it is not easily transmitted from birds to humans, and more importantly, human to human spread is poor. However, swapping genetic material, should an individual be co-infected with both, might produce a hybrid H5 (avian flu) N2 (human flu) virus with devastating effects. DNA sequencing of the viral genome from various outbreaks has shown that the virus continues to mutate. This has implications for pathogenicity, as well as antiviral drug resistance, and having the right vaccine ready if needed. In this unpredictable environment, the value of rapid NAT diagnostics is crucial to detect early cases and for public health surveillance. The genes of the virus that caused the 1918 pandemic have been studied to better understand what makes an influenza virus virulent and capable of producing a pandemic [35] . (H1N1, 1918) : The virus from this pandemic, which killed about 40 million people, had not been isolated. Without a virus little research was possible, then the viral RNA sequence was determined using material from archival tissue, including formalin-fixed autopsy material. The sequence itself did not provide clues for why the Spanish influenza virus was so virulent, and so the next step was to reconstruct the viral coding segments and clone them into plasmids. Individual genes from the H1N1 1918 virus were then introduced into a common laboratory viral strain and pathogenicity sought. Although the H and N glycoproteins were factors in the virulence of this virus, it was also shown that one of the RNA polymerase subunits known as PB1 was involved. Another subunit (PB2) was then found to be important for viral transmissibility [35] . Swine influenza (H1N1, later called H1N1(09), 2009): After the appearance and then rapid disappearance of SARS (Box 6.4), followed by the concerns regarding the possibility of a H5N1 pandemic that did not occur (so far), This infection attracted a lot of publicity and provoked considerable fear when it emerged in China and then Hong Kong in 2003. SARS subsequently spread to many countries, producing around 700 deaths in the first half of 2003. This was at one time described as the first pandemic of the 21st century, but it never progressed beyond an epidemic because of effective public health measures effected by mid 2003 [36] . The social and economic impacts of this infection were considerable, including major disruptions to international travel. SARS was shown to be caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV) which was thought to have crossed the species barrier, although the animal reservoir for SARS took a while to find. It is now thought to be:",

More recently, Aedes albopictus, a potential vector for dengue virus, has become established in the USA following its conveyance from South East Asia in old car tires. With this, the threat of dengue in the North American continent has become real. Humans have populated rural areas to an increasing extent, as well as pursuing more outdoor recreational activities.

In obese humans and animals (mouse, rat and pig) the ratio of the two major bacterial divisions in the gut shows a predominance of Firmicutes over the Bacteroides. This is likely to be a primary rather than secondary effect, because when germ-free mice were fed the microbioata derived from lean or obese mice, the phenotype of the recipient mice moved towards that of the donor mouse -i.e. the obese or lean phenotype was transmissible via the microbiome. One mechanism for this observation may be that the obese microbiome can extract more energy from food [46] . New targets for interventions may be found as the metagenomics story unfolds and more is found about the gut flora and its effects on a range of issues including obesity and inflammation.",

There is a parallel here with pharmacogenetics. Conventional dietary guidelines take consideration of age, sex, height, weight and level of physical activity but not genetic variability. Many of these parameters are used to determine drug dosage, although it is now clear that genetic variability also plays an important role (Chapter 3). A more personalized approach becomes possible through nutrigenetics -how individuals respond differently (because of genetic variation) to the same diet, for example, through changes in blood pressure or serum cholesterol, and nutrigenomics -the role of nutrients and bioactive food compounds in gene expression. The ultimate goal is the development of personalized nutrition options to ensure health and prevent disease [47] . Overarching these goals is the incredible diversity of genetic, cultural and environmental considerations in diet. Nutrigenomics can be approached through many of the omics including genomics, Apart from the MC4R example given, other genes associated with obesity have a recessive mode of inheritance. They include mutations causing deficiency in leptin and its receptor (LEP, LEPR) which act via the hypothalamus to control appetite and energy expenditure. One report, concerning a child with congenital leptin deficiency, described how a sustained reduction in weight occurred following treatment with recombinant human leptin. Other genes in the leptin-melanocortin pathway are also implicated including POMC and PCSK1. A human gene FTO was shown to be implicated strongly with the BMI (body mass index) in a genome wide association study involving subjects with type II diabetes. This has been replicated in other studies and appears to be reflecting common SNP polymorphisms in intron 1, with the risk allele highly prevalent in the general population. European carriers who are homozygous for the risk allele weigh on average 3 kg more. Some clues to FTO gene function include:",

The role of vitamin D in cancer may be better understood through a molecular approach. This is important in view of the successful public health campaigns in reducing the risk of sun-related skin cancers. Interventions recommended include the generous application of sunscreens, avoidance of sun and the wearing of wide brimmed hats, particularly in children.
