During amplification with target-specific oligonucleotide primers, a fluorogenic oligonucleotide probe with both reporter \u017d . dye FAM, VIC, TET, JOE, or HEX and \u017d . quencher dye TAMRA attached, anneals specifically to the amplified product between the amplimers. The detection reaction utilises the 5\u0408 exonuclease activity of AmpliTaq Gold TM DNA polymerase to cleave the reporter dye from the probe, which results in an increased fluorescence \u017d . when target is present Fig. 1a . A sequence detector instrument calculates a reporter dye value \u017d . R for each sample during each cycle of amplin fication. The value of R , or the normalised ren porter signal, represents the fluorescence of the reporter dye divided by a passive reference dye. During PCR, R increases as the amplicon copy n number increases until the reaction approaches a plateau. The value \u232c R represents the norn \u017d . malised reporter signal R minus the baseline n signal established in the first few cycles of PCR. Like R , \u232c R increases during PCR as the amn n plicon copy number increases until the reaction \u017d . reaches a plateau Fig. 1b . The use of a sequence detector allows measurement of the amplified product in direct proportion to the increase in fluorescence emission continuously during PCR \u017d . amplification. The threshold cycle C value is T calculated in real time and is defined as the PCR cycle number at which an increase in reporter fluorescence above the baseline signal can first be detected. Therefore the cycling point of a given amplification where a significant increase in the fluorescence signal associated with exponential growth of the PCR product is first detected, rep-\u017d resents the C value of that amplification Fig. T . 1b . A linear relationship exists between the C T value and starting quantity of target molecule, allowing the construction of a standard curve. The greater the amount of target copies in the \u017d .\u017d reaction, the lower the C value Fig. 2 Heid et T . al., 1996; Livak and Perkin Elmer, 1998 . There are many advantages of real time Q-PCR over conventional end-point PCR. For example, real-time Q-PCR is performed in a closed reaction system and eliminates the post-PCR processing of PCR products, thereby increasing throughput and reducing the chances of carryover con-tamination. Moreover, the TaqMan Q-PCR system incorporates a chemical system termed Am-pErase to avoid amplicon contamination. Like conventional qualitative PCR assays, Q-PCR assays should operate under a strict contamination \u017d control system i.e. separate air spaces for all . reactions to give increased assurance of re-avoiding cross-contamination. Because of the increased throughput of real time Q-PCR, a higher assay sensitivity can be achieved with relative ease. Multiple replicated reactions can be used to increase the chance of observing a low level virus \u017d below the limit of detection Heid et al., 1996;  . Livak and Perkin Elmer, 1998 . In addition, coupling real-time Q-PCR to robotic extraction and PCR set-up systems will increase throughput further and minimise human error.",

One of the first steps in the identification of the nucleic acid target is comparison of the target sequence or amplicon using multiple sequence alignments with DNA sequence databanks. This allows an assessment of potential cross-reaction with other related sequences that may produce problems in the Q-PCR testing. Determination of primer specificity is of utmost importance when performing pathogen detection studies. False positive reactions, although uncommon, can lead to major problems in the release of biotechnology products for clinical trial.

Each operator should determine these assay parameters at least once, using a minimum of five concentrations over the range of the assay. The importance of optimisation and validation is highlighted when working with non-validated rapidly developed Q-PCR assays. High background fluorescent signals leading to reduced assay sensitivity and abnormal amplification signals have been observed in assays before assay optimisation and validation, further supporting the need for assay validation.

F-PERT is up to 10 -fold more sensitive than conventional RT assays for detecting the \u017d presence of retroviruses Maudru and Peden, . 1997; Lovatt et al., 1999 . This increased sensitivity, prompted The Center for Biologics Evalua-\u017d . tion and Research CBER to request PERT testing on all viral vaccines being investigated for ( ) humans. Consequently, F-PERT is the first choice for detection of RT in live viral vaccines, gene therapy preparations and the screening of animals and patients for Porcine endogenous retro-\u017d . virus PERV in xenotransplantation trials. F-PERT is a RT-dependent Q-PCR assay and therefore combines the broad specificity of conventional RT assays with the high sensitivity and fast throughput of Q-PCR. As with conventional RT assays, F-PERT is utilised to detect the RT activity packaged into extracellular retrovirus particles. The assay involves converting RNA template to cDNA and then amplifying the cDNA using product-specific primers. As no exogenous RT activity is added to the reaction, cDNA will only be generated if the sample itself contains RT activity. When RT activity is not present, the \u017d product will not be detected Silver et al., 1993; Pyra et al., 1994; Heneine et al., 1995; Arnold et . al., 1998 . One major advantage of F-PERT assays over other similar types of assays, is the capability to discriminate between the amplification signals generated by retroviral RT activity and those which are a result of the RT-like activity from DNA polymerases. F-PERT uses activated calf thymus DNA to suppress the RT-like activity from cellular and Taq DNA polymerases with no \u017d . reduction in the RT activity Table 4 . A linear \u017d . relationship between threshold cycle C and the T number of MLV retrovirus particles or RT and PERV is approximately 1000 virion particles and 1000\u139010 000 molecules of purified AMV RT enzyme, however, the assay can detect lower levels of retrovirus with decreased frequency.

Xenotropic MLV infect human cells, but not their natural rodent host cells. Polytropic MLVs, also \u017d . termed mink-cell focus MCF forming MLV can infect both rodent and non-rodent cells, and have a broader host range than xenotropic MLV. Unlike xenotropic and ecotropic MLV, infectious polytropic MLV do not pre-exist in the mouse germ line, but can arise by recombination between infectious ecotropic MLV and endogenous MLV-related polytropic sequences. In certain laboratory mouse strains, the progeny of several non-ecotropic MLV can recombine with exogenous or endogenous MLV sequences to result in oncogenic variants such as MCF virus \u017d .

Such retroviral clearance studies can use ( ) virus inactivation treatments such as low pH of elution buffers during manufacturing. Viral clearance studies in scaled down conditions, involve spiking the load sample with a known amount of infectious virus to allow assessment of retroviral removal by examination of the eluate by infectivity assay or Q-PCR.

Since, plasmids are receiving increasing attention for use as vectors in gene therapy preparations, methods to monitor their stability and yield is of fundamental importance during manufacturing. Monitoring changes in transgene copy number and levels of mRNA expression is critical for the isolation of stable cell lines and in the streamlining of constructs for production. However, production and purification of large amounts of the therapeutic plasmid vector can be hindered by a number of factors, including bacterial host strain, plasmid DNA instability and copy number per cell.
