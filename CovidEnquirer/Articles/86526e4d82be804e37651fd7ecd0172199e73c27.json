Despite the fact that zoonotic transmission was suspected in the first few cases, a recent family cluster in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia suggests that the virus might show at least limited spread from person to person, which justifies continuing epidemiological surveillance.",

Five cases, three of which were fatal, occurred in Saudi Arabian citizens. Two cases occurred in Qatari citizens, including one who travelled to Saudi Arabia 2 weeks before the onset of the disease. Two fatal cases occurred in Jordan. So far, only the three most recently confirmed cases in Saudi Arabia have been epidemiologically linked-they are from the same family, living in the same household. No secondary cases were observed in the hospital among doctors and nurses caring for the patients, which suggests that the disease did not spread readily. A history of animal contact with camels, sheep and bats has been documented.",

Alternatively, these nine documented cases may just represent the tip of an iceberg, with a majority of cases remaining undetected because of mild or asymptomatic forms of infection [6] .

Participants in the survey were Hajj pilgrims travelling with one specialized travel agency in Marseille. Pilgrims older than 18 years were included on a voluntary basis, and participants were asked to sign a written consent form. Follow-up was conducted by a French Muslim Arabic-speaking medical doctor during the journey period, who systematically documented travel-associated diseases (medical consultation, hospitalization, fever, cough, and other respiratory symptoms). Nasal swabs were obtained from all of the study participants: (i) just before leaving France to travel to Saudi Arabia; and (ii) just before returning from Saudi Arabia to France, regardless of their medical condition. Additional samples were obtained during the stay in Saudi Arabia from symptomatic patients, in a number of cases. Samples were placed in viral transport medium at the point of collection, kept at room temperature, and transported to the Marseille laboratory for storage at \u00c080\u00b0C. Total nucleic acids were purified from a 200-lL volume of sample spiked with MS2 + T4 bacteriophage as internal control [8] , by use of the BIOROBOT EZ1 XL with the Virus Mini kit v2.0 (both from Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). Each sample was tested independently with the two systems developed by Corman et al. [9] in a 25-lL reaction containing 5 lL of RNA, 12.5 lL of 2X buffer (iScriptTM One-Step RT-PCR Kit for Probes (BioRad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France)), 1 lL of reverse transcriptase/ Taq, 400 nM each primer, and 160 nM probe. The cycling profile (50\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 95\u00b0C for 5 min, and then 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 30 s) was obtained on BioRad CFX 96 cyclers. The limit of detection was tested at 90 and 820 genome equivalents per reaction for the ORF1b and the UpE system, respectively. Ethical approval was obtained from the Saudi authorities.",

One patient only was hospitalized (ILI + diarrhoea). A total of 70 (41.4%) pilgrims who suffered from respiratory symptoms had a nasal swab taken while they had symptoms. One hundred and fifty-four pilgrims (91.1%) had a systematic nasal swab taken during the 3 days before returning to France. All PCRs were negative for HCoV-EMC, with the two RT-PCR assays.

            "text": "The purpose of our work was not to investigate patients meeting the case definition for suspicion of HCoV-EMC infection [10] , but to investigate the potential circulation of HCoV-EMC in Hajj pilgrims independently of the occurrence of respiratory symptoms. Clinical data from the 2012 cohort show higher rates of cough (83.4% vs. 48.5%), sore throat (79.9% vs. 36.1%) and ILI (41.0% vs. 8.0%) than in a previous study conducted on French pilgrims during the 2009 Hajj [11] . This may be attributable to better follow-up of pilgrims in 2012, which was probably greatly helped by the presence of a medical doctor together with pilgrims during the Hajj; the 2009 survey was conducted by telephone interview after pilgrims had returned to France. This may also account for an actual higher rate of respiratory infections in 2012. Seasonal influenza vaccine is recommended for Hajj pilgrims by the French Ministry of Health [12] . The lower influenza vaccination rate among pilgrims of the 2012 cohort, recruited at a travel agency (40.3%), than among pilgrims of the 2009 cohort, recruited when they were receiving pre-travel advice at our clinic (97.4%) [11] , may also possibly account for the higher rate of ILI in 2012 than in 2009. Our results are based on relatively small numbers of individuals, and are therefore not representative of all pilgrims participating in the Hajj. However, the absence of HCoV-EMC among French pilgrims despite a very high attack rate of cough episodes suggests that the virus did not play a major role in the epidemiology of Hajjassociated respiratory infections during 2012.",

However, the recent family cluster in the Kindom of Saudi Arabia suggests that the virus might show at least limited spread from person to person, which justifies continuing epidemiological surveillance. Further investigations are being conducted to identify other pathogens among the 2012 French pilgrim cohort.",
