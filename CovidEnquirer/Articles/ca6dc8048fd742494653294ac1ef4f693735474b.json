In this study, the possibility of transmission of BVDV from calves simultaneously subjected to acute BVDV and bovine coronavirus (BCV) infection was investigated. Ten calves were inoculated intranasally with BVDV Type 1. Each of the 10 calves was then randomly allocated to one of two groups. In each group there were four additional calves, resulting in five infected and four susceptible calves per group. Virulent BCV was actively introduced in one of the groups by means of a transmitter calf. Two calves, susceptible to both BVDV and BCV, were kept in a separate group, as controls. All ten calves actively inoculated with BVDV became infected as shown by seroconversions, and six of them also shed the virus in nasal secretions. However, none of the other eight calves in the two groups (four in each) seroconverted to this agent. In contrast, it proved impossible to prevent the spread of BCV infection between the experimental groups and consequently all 20 study calves became infected with the virus.",

All calves, including the controls, showed at least one of the following clinical signs during days 3\u00b115 after the trial started: fever (!40 C), depressed general condition, diarrhoea, and cough. The study showed that BVDV primarily infected cattle, even when co-infected with an enteric and respiratory pathogen, are inefficient transmitters of BVDV. This finding supports the principle of the Scandinavian BVDV control programmes that elimination of BVDV infection from cattle populations can be achieved by identifying and removing persistently infected (PI) animals, i.e. that long-term circulation of the virus without the presence of PI animals is highly unlikely.",

            "text": "The control measures are focused on excluding the main transmitters of the infection, the persistently infected (PI) animals, from the market, and also on preventing trade with dams that carry PI foetuses. Also to be taken into account is the risk of introducing the infection to susceptible herds by other transmission routes without the initial presence of a PI animal. As animals with an acute BVDV infection can have a transient period of viral shedding (Kirkland et al., 1991; Bolin & Ridpath, 1992) , direct contact with such animals could be sufficient for transmission to occur. However, reports on the ability of acutely infected animals to serve as a vehicle for the spread of BVDV are contradictory. Attempts to transmit the virus by direct contact between primarily infected and susceptible cattle have proved unsuccessful (Niskanen et al., 2000) . Furthermore, animals that were experimentally infected by insemination, by parenteral injection or by rectal examination, did not transmit the infection to susceptible in-contact animals (Pritchard, 1963; Meyling & Jensen, 1988; Lang-Ree et al., 1994) . On the other hand, field studies in large herds have shown different results and seroconversions have occurred during extended timeperiods (up to 2.5 years), although the presence of PI animals was not detected and no direct contact with PI cattle was found (Barber et al., 1985; Brownlie et al., 1987; Meyling et al., 1990; Moerman et al., 1993; Edwards, 1997) . These differences in transmission rates may be explained in part by interacting immunosuppressive factors relating to the virus strain, the environment, and the management procedures.",

            "text": "In this study there was no transmission of BVDV from calves simultaneously subjected to acute BVDV and BCV infection, whereas all study calves became infected with BCV. These BVDV results are in agreement with previously published studies (Lang-Ree et al., 1994; Niskanen et al., 2000) and confirm the experiences from ongoing BVDV-control programmes that the virus is not easily transmitted to susceptible cattle by primarily infected animals. On the other hand, the results clearly show that introduction of a BCV-infected animal can result in a rapid spread of BCV to all susceptible animals within a unit. This is consistent with the high morbidity described in diarrhoea outbreaks associated with BCV (Durham et al., 1989; Saif, 1990; Alenius et al., 1991) . All 10 calves inoculated with BVDV became infected, as shown by seroconversion, and six of them were found to shed virus in nasal secretions. Susceptible in-contact calves were exposed to the acutely BVDV-infected calves and to their excretions by being housed together in the same pens throughout the experiment. Furthermore, BCV was introduced which should, in theory, facilitate the transmission of BVDV by causing increased nasal secretions, cough and diarrhoea, clinical signs that were indeed shown by the dually infected calves. In addition, co-infection as with BCV in this trial may reduce the non-specific resistance and consequently lower the BVDV dose required for infection of the BVDV-susceptible in-contact calves. However, the timing of the co-infection may be crucial. The introduction of BCV one day after the BVDV inoculation was chosen to ensure maximum onset of clinical signs from the BCV infection at the time when BVDV excretion was expected, i.e. 4\u00b19 days after BVDV inoculation (Bruschke, 1998) . Also, BCV was introduced before the expected interferon Type 1 response to the BVDV infection on days 3\u00b14 (Tra \u00cave \u00c2n et al., 1991) , in order to minimize the inhibitory effect on BCV replication. By the inadvertent transmission of BCV to group B, we also had an opportunity to study the effect of BCV infection introduced 2\u00b13 days after the BVDV infection, as suggested by BCV shedding in faeces. Yet no transmission of BVDV occurred in either group. However, the introduction of BCV before BVDV was not studied in this experiment. It is possible that the susceptibility of the calves to the BVDV challenge could have been increased by a preceding BCV infection. Factors contributing to the failure of BVDV transmission may have been low viral excretion by the primarily infected calves, and low virulence of the non-cytopathogenic BVDV strain used. The variation in virulence, as reflected by clinical signs, between BVDV isolates is considerable. For example, animals infected with certain BVDV Type 2 strains show serious illness and have high virus titres in serum for a prolonged period of time (Corapi et al., 1990; Bruschke, 1998; Carman et al., 1998) . It is also possible that the spreading of the virus could have been demonstrated if a cytopathogenic biotype of BVDV strain had been used in the experiment. Furthermore, the transmission of BVDV might have been more successful if the calves, both transmitters and susceptible in-contact calves, had been exposed to environmental, nutritional and/or transportation stresses. BCV transmission from the transmitter calf to the calves in group A probably occurred by contact with nasal secretions and/or by aerosol, since faecal material was not introduced into the pen of group A. Despite the rigorous measures taken to prevent the spread of BCV infection, all calves (including groups B and C) became infected with this virus. BCV infection is highly contagious and infected calves frequently propagate the virus via the enteric and respiratory tracts simultaneously (Saif et al., 1986; Heckert et al., 1990) . We tried to prevent the spread of BCV (via both direct and indirect routes) between groups by housing the calves in two separate units (group A in one unit and groups B and C in separate pens in another unit). The units were located approximately 30 m apart in separate corridors. They also had separate manure-shutters. Furthermore, the personnel taking care of and examining the animals only worked with calves in one of the units during any one single day and protective coats and boots were worn when entering each pen. In addition, the units had separate air ducts with extractor fans to evacuate stable air. Even so, air may still have been circulating within the building. Early BCV-shedding (day 2) was detected in nasal secretions, indicating replication of the virus in the upper respiratory tract. This supports our hypothesis that the rapid spread of BCV between units was due to aerosol transmission.",

BCV was found in nasal secretions and in faeces of the calves and the infection was confirmed by seroconversions in all calves. However, the faecal excretion of BCV was significantly lower (P`0.05) in the dually infected calves than in calves infected with BCV only. This could indicate a direct or indirect interference of BVDV with BCV replication, possibly mediated by BVDV-induced interferon Type 1 (Tra \u00cave \u00c2n et al., 1991) . A virulent field strain of BCV, originating from an outbreak of winter dysentery in adult cows, was used to introduce BCV infection in the experimental calves. The clinical disease shown by the calves is consistent with previously published experimental studies demonstrating that the outcome of the BCV infection is largely unaffected by both the origin of the virus (cow or calf isolate) and the route of inoculation (nasal or oral) (Saif et al., 1986; El-Kanawati et al., 1996; Tra \u00cave \u00c2n et al., 2001) .",

We conclude that spread of BCV infection is very difficult to prevent within a cow-house. To prevent the spread of BCV between herds, all direct and indirect contacts with herds with current or recent outbreaks of diarrhoea among cows and/or calves should be avoided. Furthermore, we suggest that spread of BVDV infection is not likely to occur during periods when the only source of virus is primarily infected animals. Consequently, BVDV does not seem to be a very contagious agent capable of causing acute epizootic diarrhoea in cattle herds, provided no PI animals are introduced into the herds. Therefore, it seems highly likely that the early reports of BVDV in connection with outbreaks of acute epizootic diarrhoea actually described a scenario where other enteric pathogen(s), for example BCV, co-existed with BVDV but escaped detection due to lack of appropriate virus diagnostic methods.",
