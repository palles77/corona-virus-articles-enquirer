The RNA was eluted in 60 \u03bcL AVE buffer and was used as a template for further detection by a pan-coronavirus nested PCR targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene. First-round reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was conducted by using forward primer 5-GGKTG-GGAYTAYCCKAARTG-3 and reverse primer 5-TGYTGTSWRCA-RAAYTCRTG-3 and QIAGEN 1-step RT-PCR kit.

The PCR cycler conditions for the amplification were 50\u00b0C for 30 min (reverse transcription) then 95\u00b0C for 15 min, 45 cycle of 94\u00b0C for 15 s (denaturation), 48\u00b0C for 30 s (annealing), 72\u00b0C for 40 s (extension), then 72\u00b0C for 10 min (final extension). The PCR product was then put through a second round PCR by using a new set of primers (forward primer 5-GGTTGG-GACTATCCTAAGTGTGA-3, reverse primer 5-CCATCATCAGATAG-AATCATCAT-3) which amplify a final PCR product of 440 bp. Using Phusion High Fidelity PCR Master Mix Kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), a 25-\u03bcL reaction contained 12.5 \u03bcL of 2X phusion master mix, 1.5 \u03bcL (10 Pmole) forward primer, 1.5 \u03bcL (10 Pmole) reverse primer, 7.5 \u03bcL H2O, and 2 \u03bcL of PCR product.

The reaction product was purified by exclusion chromatography in CentriSep columns (Princeton Separations, Adelphia, NJ, USA). The recovered materials were sequenced by using a 96-capillary 3730xl DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Sequences were assembled by using SeqMan DNA Lasergene 7 software (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA). Sequence analysis was performed by using BioEdit 7.0 and MEGA 6.0 for multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree construction of applying the neighbor-joining method with Kimura's 2-parameter distance model and 1,000 bootstrap replicates (3,4). An RT nested PCR designed specifically for this study was used for amplifying N gene sequences of HKU9-like viruses.
