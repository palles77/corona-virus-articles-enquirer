We revealed blood cell immune response profiles using 5' mRNA, TCR and BCR V(D)J transcriptome analysis with single-cell resolution. Data from 134,620 PBMCs and 83,387 TCR and 12,601 BCR clones was obtained, and 56 blood cell subtypes and 23 new cell marker genes were identified from 16 participants. The number of specific subtypes of immune cells changed significantly when compared patients with controls. Activation of the interferon-MAPK pathway is the major defense mechanism, but MAPK transcription signaling is inhibited in cured patients. TCR and BCR V(D)J recombination is highly diverse in generating different antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the interferon-MAPK pathway and TCR-and BCR-produced antibodies play important roles in the COVID-19 immune response. Immune deficiency or immune overresponse may result in the condition of patients with COVID-19 becoming critical or severe.",

Many immune cells (such as leukocytes) and immune molecules (such as specific plasma proteins) are intrinsic components of blood. Therefore, the functions of blood and the immune system are inseparable. T cells and B cells are important in the pathogenesis of many-perhaps all-immune-mediated diseases (14) (15) (16) (17) . A T cell receptor (TCR) mediates recognition of pathogen-associated epitopes through interactions with peptide and major histocompatibility complexes (pMHCs). TCRs and B cell receptors (BCRs) are generated by genomic rearrangement at the germline level, a process termed V(D)J recombination, which has the ability to generate marked diversity among TCRs and BCRs. Parameterizing the elements of antigenspecific immune repertoires across a diverse set of epitopes may generate powerful applications in a variety of research fields for the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases. Here, we focus on insights into blood immune responses to COVID-19 using 5' mRNA, TCR, and BCR V(D)J recombination analysis with 4 4 single-cell resolution.",

After quality control, we obtained 134,620 PBMC cells, 83,387 TCR clones, and 12,601 BCR clones from the 16 samples. In these samples, we identified 17 completely different PBMC cell types, which could be further divided into 56 cell subtypes according to marker genes of the 134,620 cells (Fig. 1B, 1C, 1D and Table S2 ). The 17 cell types included CD4+ T cells identified by LTB and IL7R markers, CD8+ T cells identified by LEF1 and CD8A, CD1C+_B dendritic cells identified by BSET1 and CD1D, CD4+ cytotoxic T cells identified by CST7 and CCL4, CD8 cytotoxic T cells identified by CD3D and CD8A, and other cell types (Fig. 1C, Table S2 ). This suggests that human PBMCs have evolved highly differentiated cell subtypes to resist the invasion of pathogens (18) . There were three main states in the analysis process for reconstructing the developmental trajectories of the 56 cell subtypes, which showed a continuous trajectory of differentiating PBMCs (Fig. 1E, Fig. S2 ). In addition, 23 totally new candidate marker genes linked to 22 cell subtypes were identified (Fig. S3) , suggesting potential roles for these newly discovered cell markers in the identification and functional study of these subtypes.",

In other COVID-19 conditions, the interferon signal was also over-activated to varying degrees. However, in the cured patients, the interferon signal was just mildly activated compared to the patients with severe and moderate conditions. In the cured condition, the signal pathway related to mRNA translation of the virus was suppressed, while the signal pathway related to MAPK was significantly enriched (Fig. 2C , Table S3-6). To detect whether these signaling pathway changes were specific to COVID-19, we compared the COVID-19 patients with the patients with influenza A (patient 11), acute pharyngitis (patient 12), and cerebral infarction (patient 13) and found that the signaling pathways were still enriched after filtering with these related disease controls (Fig. S14 ).

Among them, interferon \u03b1-inducible protein 27 (IFI27), originally known to involve in innate immunity and to intervene in cell proliferation (22) , was increasingly expressed in many cell types, including CD1C+_B dendritic cells, Table S8 ). These genes were previously shown to regulate cell invasion, migration, proliferation and innate immunity by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine production (27, 28) . In three groups of inpatients with different conditions, the up-regulated expression of these genes was observed in CD1C+_B dendritic cell, CD1C-CD141dendritic cell, CD141+CLEC9A+ dendritic cell, CD8 cytotoxic T cells, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Interestingly, in contrast to the three groups of inpatients, the expression pattern of these genes in the two cured patients was the opposite. In the cured patients, down-regulated expression was detected, indicating that the MAPK signaling pathway was inhibited in these cells. These results indicate that downregulation of the MAPK signal pathway may be one sign of patient recovery.",

We further performed PBMC immunofluorescence testing to compare the protein expressions of IFI27 between patients with COVID-19 and controls.

Therefore, in patients with COVID-19, the damage is related to multiple organs (32) . The leukocyte immune responses involve many cell subtypes, including CD8+ T cells, CD8 cytotoxic T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD4+ cytotoxic T cells, CD1C+_B dendritic cells and other cell subtypes. After the virus reaches the blood immune cells, it might replicate-mainly in AXL+SIGLEC6+ dendritic cells, CD4+ T cells, and naive CD8+ T cells and might activate multiple cell subtypes of the interferon signal pathway to produce effectors, such as IFI27, IFITM1 and IFITM3, to fight the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The similar process also happened to Influenza and West Nile Virus infection in human (23, 24) . Through downstream activation of MAPK, the expression of downstream effectors is activated by key transcription factors, such as FOS, JUN, and JUNB, which lead to a wide range of antiviral responses in the blood system (Fig. 4C) . These results suggested that the immune response may come back the normal situation when the patients recovery, and the MAPK signal is thus inhibited.",

In the critical condition, the number of different cell types, expressed genes, and TCR/BCR responses indicated a relationship between the critical nature of the patient's condition and his immunodeficiency. On the contrary, the severe condition was shown to be related to a strong autoimmune response and over-activated interferon pathway. These results suggested that immune deficiency or immune over-reacts may make patients with COVID-19 go to worse condition because of their imbalance adaptive immune response (33) (34) (35) . Our study also shows that the activation of the interferon-MAPK signaling pathway and TCR-and BCRproduced antibodies play key roles in combating SARS-CoV-2 infection.

(B) Immunofluorescence staining of IFI27 in PBMCs of patients with COVID-19 and normal controls. (C) Anti-SARS-CoV-2 response of the blood system. After the virus reaches the blood immune cells, it can activate multiple cell subtypes of the interferon signal pathway to produce effectors, such as IFI27, IFITM1, and IFITM3, to fight the virus. Through downstream activation of MAPK, the expression of downstream effectors is activated by key transcription factors, FOS, JUN, and JUNB, which lead to a wide range of antiviral responses in the blood system.

To further investigate the immune cell behaviors of each cell subtype in different conditions of COVID-19, we separately compared the critical, severe, moderate, and cured patients with the normal controls (Fig. 2A). For the critical condition (patient 1), the proportion of 40 out of the 56 cell subtypes decreased; some subtypes, including CD8+ T cell (cluster 52), CD4+ T cell (cluster 55,56) and plasmacytoid dendritic cell (cluster 53), disappeared. These changes may suggest immunodeficiency in the patient. This is consistent with the lower number of lymphocytes in the patient (0.75 \u00d7 10 9 /L) compared to the normal range (1.1-3.2 \u00d7 10 9 /L, Table S1). However, some other cell subtypes, including CD8 cytotoxic T cells (cluster 9), CD1C+_B dendritic cells (cluter 7, 13, 19, 30, 39), effector CD8+ memory T (Tem) cells (cluster 14), and CD141+CLEC9A+ dendritic cells (cluster 45), increased, suggesting the limited immune response existed. In the severe condition (patient 2), the proportion of 45 of the 56 cell types increased, which may suggest over-activation of immune cells, including CD8+ T cells (cluster 1, 4, 18, 28 etc.), CD8 cytotoxic T cells (cluster 1 and cluster 25), CD4+ cytotoxic T cells (cluster 8 and cluster 21), Naive CD8+ T cell (cluster 2), plasmacytoid dendritic cell (cluster 53), and others. However, AXL+SIGLEC6+ dendritic cells (cluster 54) decreased in this patient. In the moderate condition (patients 3-8), the proportion of various cell types was between that of the critical and severe conditions. In the cured patients, effector CD8+ memory T (Tem) cells (cluster 14), megakaryocyte progenitor cells (cluster 23), CD1C+_B dendritic cells (cluster 39), and CD141+CLEC9A+ dendritic cells (cluster 45) decreased significantly.

These significantly enriched signal pathways were mainly involved in viral mRNA translation (high gene expressions in AXL+SIGLEC6+ dendritic cells, CD4+ T cells, and other cells) (Fig. S4-5),interaction alpha/beta signaling(Fig. S6-7), a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (Fig. S8-9), immunology interactions between lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells (CD1C+_B dendritic cells and CD4+ cytotoxic T cells)(Fig. S10-11), and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II protein complex (B cells and CD1C+_B dendritic cells)(Fig. S12-13), suggesting that antigen presentation for targeting the virus was activated.",

The expression trends of these genes were similar in the four COVID-19 conditions. The results indicate that interferon signals, especially interferon alfa/beta/gamma and interferon type I, are activated in the blood of patients with COVID-19.Then, in the downstream of the interferon signaling, we found that MAPK signaling pathway transcription factors were activated in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, including high expressions of FOS, JUN, JUNB, and DUSP1 (Fig. 2K-N,",
