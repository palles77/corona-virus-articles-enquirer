            "text": "The pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza A virus (H1N1v) emerged in April 2009 and was first detected in a cluster of human respiratory cases in Mexico and the USA; initially, the virus could not be subtyped using available molecular tests. [1] [2] [3] Genetic and antigenic characterisation of the H1N1v virus showed it to be distinct from current seasonal H1N1 influenza A viruses circulating in humans. 4, 5 Rapid spread of H1N1v to other continents and frequent escalating human transmission resulted in an official declaration of a new human influenza A pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 June 2009. 6, 7 Regardless of their host of origin, influenza A viruses usually have the potential to infect and, during dual infections, re-assort in other host species. Pigs are particularly susceptible to infections from other hosts because receptors for influenza A viruses of both human and avian origin are present in their upper respiratory tract. 8, 9 Swine influenza viruses (SIVs) circulating in pig herds include H1N1, H3N2 and H1N2 subtypes and these have been observed globally. [10] [11] [12] [13] H1N1 SIVs were first isolated in the 1930s, and phylogenetic studies have shown that these ''classical swine'' isolates were originally closely related to the human H1N1 ''Spanish 'flu''' pandemic influenza virus of 1918, but subsequently these classical H1N1 SIVs evolved into a unique genetic lineage. 11 H3N2 SIVs have also evolved distinctly in pigs following the human ''Asian 'flu''' pandemic of 1968. During the early 1990s, ''avian-like'' H1N1 SIVs became common in European farmed pigs and have replaced classical swine H1N1. 10, 11 However, classical swine H1N1 remained present in the USA and many parts of Asia. [10] [11] [12] [13] Evolution of SIVs in North America has included emergence of a triple re-assortment H3N2 in 1998 that contained genes of human, avian, and classical H1N1 swine influenza origin genes. 12, 13 These triple reassortant viruses have become endemic in North America, and, through additional reassortment events, triple reassortant variants of the H1N1 and H1N2 subtypes have been detected. 5, 12, 13 In the case of H1N2 SIVs isolated in Europe, the H1 gene is of human H1 seasonal influenza origin. 11, 14 The first instance of infection of pigs with H1N1v was reported in May 2009 in Canada where it was suspected that pigs were infected through contact with infected humans. 15, 16 SIVs are known to infect humans 17, 18 and poultry, [19] [20] [21] [22] while human influenza A viruses are also known to transmit to pigs. 23 Continuing human cases of H1N1v during 2009 sustained veterinary concerns that this virus may become established in pigs, with a degree of concern that this host may then serve as a source for further influenza A reassortment and future zoonotic transmission. 24 Although swine influenza is not listed as a notifiable disease by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), 25, 26 SIV surveillance programmes have been carried out in Europe and North America and have provided valuable epidemiological information. [10] [11] [12] [13] These surveillance programmes have been based on conventional testing as recommended by the OIE, 27 using attempted virus isolation (VI) in cell culture and embryonated fowls' eggs (EFEs), followed by typing with defined antisera to identify the haemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) subtypes using well-established haemagglutination and neuraminidase inhibition tests (HI and NI), respectively. 27 In recent years, highly sensitive and specific real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT PCR) technology has been exploited by veterinary institutes and reference laboratories to develop and validate appropriate tests for avian influenza viruses (AIVs). 28 These include validated RRT PCR tests for notifiable AI caused by H5 and H7 subtype viruses, following concerns resulting from the spread of H5N1 highly pathogenic (HP) AI in poultry in the Eastern Hemisphere, together with a number of accompanying zoonotic cases. Many veterinary laboratories have already embraced generic AI RRT PCRs that detect all six-teen H subtypes of influenza A, typically through amplifying within the highly conserved M gene, and also as specific assays for AIVs of H5 and H7 subtypes. 28 While public health institutions have recently described RRT PCRs for the detection of H1N1v in the context of the current human pandemic, [29] [30] [31] [32] in this study, we describe and validate similar approaches for the detection of H1N1v in pigs. Full genome sequence analysis of the current H1N1v reveals the virus to be putatively of swine origin. 4, 5 Segment 7, which includes the matrix (M) gene that encodes the matrix M1 and M2 proteins, appears to be of Eurasian SIV origin, while segment 4, which encodes the H1 haemagglutinin (HA), is related to American classical SIV H1 genes. 4, 5 This study outlines the adaptation of an existing M gene RRT PCR assay for the generic detection of SIVs and H1N1v, plus a novel RRT PCR that amplifies within the H1 gene for the specific detection of H1N1v in European pigs.",

M gene sequences are available from over 500 SIV isolates from North America, Europe and Asia, with different sequence patterns in each region (data not shown). The sequence for the forward M gene RRT PCR primer and the probe remains highly conserved for most isolates (Table 5 ). However, the reverse primer has extensive variability at primarily five different positions for H1N1v and SIV isolates compared to the ''avian'' M gene RRT PCR primers and probes originally designed by Spackman et al. 38 Current SIVs and H1N1v isolates have from zero to four nucleotide mismatches in the reverse primer ( Table 5 ) that could potentially contribute to a decrease in sensitivity for some viruses. This influenced the design of the ''perfect match'' M gene RRT PCR ''Rev-mod'' primer for H1N1v detection, which is located at the same corresponding position as the ''M)124 R'' primer for the ''avian'' M gene RRT PCR (Table 5) .",

RNA was extracted from these influenza A preparations and used to construct 10fold dilution series, and both were tested by the three M gene RRT PCR assays, namely the ''avian'', 38 ''combo'' and ''perfect match''. The 10-fold dilution series from A \u2044 California \u2044 07 \u2044 09 (H1N1v) was also tested by the ''H1-118'' RRT PCR. The detection limit corresponded to a viral titre (pre-RNA extraction) of 1 \u00b7 10 1 EID 50 \u2044 ml for the ''perfect match'' M gene and ''H1-118'' RRT PCRs, which typically registered at Ct values 34-36. When a dilution series of quantified T7 in vitro RNA transcripts were tested, the detection limit of the ''perfect match'' M gene RRT PCR at these Ct values was 200 RNA copies and 2000 RNA copies for the H1N1v and H3N2 targets, respectively. This discrepancy in sensitivity may relate to differences in the M gene reverse primer binding sequence for the two influenza A viruses ( Fifty-one laboratory isolates of established SIVs were divided into five categories based on combinations of subtype and temporal and geographical origin (Table 1) . For the two classical H1N1 SIVs isolated in United Kingdom in 1986 and 1996, the ''avian'' and ''combo'' M gene variant RRT PCR assays appeared to be the most sensitive. However, when 35 contemporary UK and European SIVs were tested, the ''perfect match'' M gene RRT PCR was the most sensitive for detecting 34 of the isolates in the avian-like swine H1N1, H1N2 and human-like swine H3N2 categories (Table 1) . These three categories are representative of the SIVs that have been circulating in Europe for up to 30 years. 11 It should be noted that the ''combo'' M gene RRT PCR assay was slightly less sensitive, detecting the 35 contemporary European SIVs at Ct values that were higher, but by no more than 2 for the majority of these isolates ( Table 1 ). The one exception was A \u2044 swine \u2044 Eire \u2044 89 \u2044 96 (H1N1 avian-like), which was most sensitively detected by the original ''avian'' M gene RRT PCR (Table 1) .",

All archived tissue specimens from positive pigs were retested by VI in the course of this study, as well as by the three M gene RRT PCR approaches and ''H1-118'' RRT PCR ( Table 2 ). The 31 tissues from SIV-positive pigs included 18 tissues from pigs infected with avian-like swine H1N1 viruses between 1992 and 2008, six from pigs with H1N2 virus infections from 1994 to 2009 and seven from pigs infected with human-like swine H3N2 virus during 1991-1994 ( Table 2 ).

In this study, we have investigated the application of the ''avian'' M gene RRT PCR, 38 but sequence differences observed in the M gene of H1N1v isolates also prompted investigation of two new variations of the original M gene RRT PCR. The original ''avian'' M gene RRT PCR reverse primer (M)124 R), 38 with four nucleotide differences to H1N1v viruses (Table 5) , clearly resulted in a significantly lower sensitivity when testing H1N1v laboratory isolates (Table 1) . Consequently, the original avian M gene RRT PCR 38 should not be used for detection of H1N1v, and this deficiency of the diagnostic test needed to be addressed. Among the three variants of the M gene RRT PCR that were evaluated, the ''perfect match'' with the revised reverse primer (''Revmod'') provided the most sensitive results for many of the European SIVs (Tables 1 and 2 ). M gene sequence analysis showed that the ''Rev-mod'' primer compensated for two or three nucleotide mismatches in the corresponding region of the M gene from contemporary European SIVs (Table 5) . However, experiments with T7 in vitro RNA transcripts corresponding to the amplified M gene region of A \u2044 swine \u2044 England \u2044 742104 \u2044 95 (H3N2) suggested that the ''perfect match'' M gene RRT PCR may not be maximally sensitive for detection of all contemporary European SIVs, which again reflected sequence mismatches with the ''Revmod'' primer. Nevertheless, the ''perfect match'' M gene RRT PCR demonstrated successful detection of contemporary European SIVs in archived tissues from infected pigs ( Table 2) , plus five specimens (four nasal swabs from UK herds and one archived tissue, collected in 2009, highly likely to be H1N2), that were negative by VI (Tables 6 and  7) . Importantly, the ''perfect match'' RRT PCR successfully detected both H1N1v laboratory isolates (Table 1 ) and clinical specimens from pigs that had been infected with H1N1v in the field (Table 3) and experimentally (Table 4) . 36 The ''combo'' M gene RRT PCR assay was slightly less sensitive for detection of contemporary European SIVs and H1N1v (Tables 1 and 2) .",

            "text": "The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the ''perfect match'' M gene RRT PCR assay were 100% and 95AE2%, respectively, from the testing of 133 swabs (Table 6a ). The five discrepant results included a VI-negative nasal swab obtained from a H1N1v-experimentally infected pig at 7 dpi when viral shedding appeared to be waning (Ct 34AE48), and this low titre was mirrored by the corresponding H1-118 RRT PCR (Ct 34AE08; Table 4 ). The other four discrepant results were VI-negative swabs collected by UK Regional Laboratories during summer 2009 that were shown to be likely H1N2 SIV positives, so affirming these ''perfect match'' M gene RRT PCR results. This inferred a greater sensitivity for the RRT PCRs compared to VI. As regards ''perfect match'' M gene RRT PCR testing of the 116 swine tissues, however, there were four discrepant results, where a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 93AE6% and 98AE6%, respectively, were observed (Table 7a ). The 96 UK archived swine tissues were classified as SIV positive or negative at the time of original submission based on VI. Three of the 31 tissues from SIV-positive pigs were negative (No Ct) by the ''perfect match'' M gene RRT PCR (Table 2 ). It was speculated that at the time of the original submission these pigs may have been classified as SIV positive based on a VI result from another localised tissue portion or clinical specimen that was no longer available for the current validation. It was also observed that only 4 of 31 tissues obtained from SIV-positive pigs were positive when VI was repeated through two egg passages during the current validation (Table 2 ). This may be a consequence of the long-term storage history of these archived tissues, where infectivity may have been compromised by repeated freeze-thawing, or even because of limiting VI to two egg passages. One archived tissue from an SIV-negative pig collected in 2009 was positive by ''perfect match'' M gene RRT PCR, negative by ''H1-118'' RRT PCR and VI (Table 7) , but additional investigations suggested that this was a non-viable H1N2 specimen. The H1-118 RRT PCR assay was designed for the differential detection of H1N1v infections of pigs. This method successfully detected five H1N1v laboratory isolates (Table 1 ) and the presence of H1N1v in 48 clinical specimens (29 swabs and 19 post-mortem tissues) in fieldinfected and experimentally infected pigs (Tables 3 and 4) . It was also shown that the H1 genes from nine H1 AIVs, 30 European H1 SIVs (i.e. classical H1N1, contemporary avian-like swine H1N1 and H1N2) were not detected ( Table 1 ) by this assay. In addition, no positive signal was obtained when 24 archived tissue samples obtained from pigs infected with European H1N1 and H1N2 SIVs were tested with the H1-118 RRT PCR assay ( Table 2 ). This affirmed the ability of the H1-118 RRT PCR assay to differentiate H1N1v infections from those caused by the SIVs endemic in Europe. However, this test did show some cross-reactivity with North American H1 SIVs (Table 1) . This was not unexpected in view of the evolutionary relationship between the H1 gene of North American triple reassortment SIVs and H1N1v. 5 Consequently, it would not be an appropriate test for differentiating H1N1v in North American pig infections.",

This included evaluation of a generic approach to detect known SIVs as well as H1N1v. This was achieved for European SIVs by the ''perfect mach'' M gene RRT PCR assay, which sensitively detected all known types of European SIVs in addition to H1N1v. However, it was noted that contemporary Irish SIVs may be the exception to this observation in Europe (Table 1) . Testing of recent Irish SIVs by the various M gene RRT PCR assays suggests that the original ''avian'' M gene RRT PCR may be the more sensitive approach (Raleigh and Flynn, Personal Communication). In the case of North American SIVs, the ''combo'' M gene RRT PCR assay was most sensitive for generic detection, and this method was slightly less sensitive for the detection of H1N1v than the ''perfect match'' M gene RRT PCR assay. The ''H1-118'' RRT PCR assay was shown to be able to differentiate H1N1v from SIV infections in clinical samples derived from field-infected and experimentally infected pigs relevant to a European setting. Validation of the generic and differential RRT PCR assays involved not only testing of a range of laboratory-grown influenza A virus isolates, but also crucially included testing of the same set of clinical specimens from pigs infected with SIVs or H1N1v. Primers and probe for the differential ''H1-118'' RRT PCR were deliberately designed within the relatively conserved HA2 region of the HA gene of H1N1v. However, continuing molecular evolution the HA gene may yet result in nucleotide changes within these primer and probe-binding sequences. Vigilance for relevant nucleotide changes by sequencing the HA genes of new H1N1v swine isolates may identify potential future modifications to the ''H1-118'' RRT PCR.",

As the human pandemic caused by H1N1v continues to spread globally, it is anticipated that further pig infections with H1N1v will be reported, and precedent suggests that these will be followed by sustained transmission within pig populations. 36 Analogous contingency planning was conducted in 2005, when the westward spread of H5N1 highly pathogenic AIV prompted the validation of a H5 RRT PCR for the detection of both this H5 virus and other Eurasian H5 AIVs. 45 In conclusion, it is possible to present these approaches as sensitive and specific methods for use in surveillance for SIV and current H1N1v isolates in European pig populations.",
