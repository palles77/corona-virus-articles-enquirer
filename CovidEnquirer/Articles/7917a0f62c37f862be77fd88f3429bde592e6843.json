Thus, the diagnosis of infection is more difficult in transplantation than in immunologically normal individuals. The interactions between infection, immunosuppression, and immune function play out in a complex environment in which multiple simultaneous processes, such as infection and graft rejection, may contribute to the clinical presentation. Immunocompromised patients tolerate invasive, established infection poorly with high morbidity and mortality, lending urgency to the need for an early, specific diagnosis to guide antimicrobial therapy. Given the T-lymphocyte dysfunction inherent to transplant immunosuppression, viral infections in particular are increased. These viral infections not only contribute to graft dysfunction, graft rejection, and systemic illness but also enhance the risk for other opportunistic infections (e.g., Pneumocystis and Aspergillus) and virally mediated cancers.",

Common pathogens and endemic organisms causing significant morbidity in potential recipients form the basis of screening paradigms for organ donors. 10, 23, 25, 31, 41 Most types of infection have been recognized in transplant recipients at some point. Bacteremic or fungemic infections (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, Candida species, Gram-negative bacteria) in donors at the time of donation can cause local (abscess) or systemic (bacteremic) infections, and may selectively adhere to anastomotic sites (vascular, urinary) to produce leaks or mycotic aneurysms. Some viral infections are ubiquitous, including cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and are associated with particular syndromes and morbidity in the immunocompromised population (see section on selected infections of importance). The greatest risk of these infections is to seronegative (immunologically na\u00efve) recipients who receive infected grafts from seropositive donors (latent viral infection). Some viruses demonstrate accelerated progression (lymphocytic choriomeningitis, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), rabies) in transplant recipients. Latent infections, such as tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, or strongyloidiasis, may activate from grafts many years after the initial, often unrecognized exposures.",

These limitations suggest that, to achieve the benefits of transplantation, some organs are implanted carrying unidentified pathogens. This risk is exhibited by clusters of donor-derived Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas' disease), rabies virus, West Nile virus, and LCMV infections in organ transplant recipients. Molecular assays for donor screening (e.g., for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV)) have the capacity to reduce the \"window period\" between exposure and development of a positive microbiological assay (nucleic acid test (NAT) instead of seroconversion) with some risk for false-positive assays given heightened NAT sensitivity.",

These are nosocomial infections and, as such, may carry the same antimicrobial-resistant pathogens observed in non-immunosuppressed patients undergoing comparable surgery. Given immunosuppression, the signs of infection may be subtle, however, and the severity or duration usually is greater. Thus, bowel perforation may be clinically silent marked only by a rising white blood cell count or graft dysfunction. The technical skill of the surgeons and meticulous postoperative care (i.e., wound care and proper maintenance and timely removal of endotracheal tubes, vascular access devices, and drainage catheters) are the determinants of risk for these infections.

A useful organ must be procured and implanted before some microbiologic assessments have been completed.

As a result, bacteremia or fungemia may not be detected until after the transplantation has been performed. Such infections generally have not resulted in transmission of infection as long as the infection has been adequately treated in terms of use of antimicrobial agents to which the organism is susceptible and time. In recipients of tissues from 95 bacteremic donors, a mean of 3.8 days of effective therapy after transplantation seemed adequate to prevent transmission of susceptible pathogens. Longer courses of therapy in the recipient are preferred, targeting known donor-derived pathogens. 17, 26 Bacterial meningitis must be treated with antibiotics that penetrate the cerebrospinal fluid before organ procurement. Individuals with unidentified and untreated causes of meningoencephalitis or sepsis should not be used as organ donors. Donor-derived infections due to Candida species have resulted from contamination or candidemia at the time of procurement. 57,58 These require susceptibility testing of the isolate and prolonged treatment (2-4 weeks) with effective agents to avoid pyelonephritis, abscess formation, mycotic aneurysm, or fungemia in the recipient. Vascular involvement by Candida species in the recipient requires at least 6 weeks of therapy. Certain acute infections (CMV, HSV, EBV, HIV, and HCV) may be undetected in the period before antibody formation. Viral nucleic acid detection assays are preferred for sensitivity. Likewise, the donor's clinical, social, and medical histories are essential to reducing the risk of such infections. In the presence of known infection, such infections must be treated before procurement if possible. Several more recent clusters of donor-derived infection have shown the risk for infection secondary to previously unrecognized pathogens, including lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, Chagas' disease, and HSV, in addition to other, more common pathogens.

In contrast, for intercurrent bacterial or fungal infections, reductions in immunosuppression should be reconsidered when resolution of infection is demonstrated. The specific reduction chosen may depend on the organisms isolated, e.g., corticosteroids and bacterial infections. Similarly, reversal of some immune deficits (e.g., neutropenia, hypogammaglobulinemia) may be possible with adjunctive therapies (e.g., colonystimulating factors or antibody). Co-infection with virus (CMV) is common and requires additional therapy. The adverse effects of reduced immune suppression during infection are best demonstrated in patients with cryptococcal meningitis in whom a \"rebound\" of inflammatory responses may result in worsening symptoms and hydrocephalus. This reflects the immune reconstitution and inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) seen with any patient in whom immune deficits are reversed in the face of ongoing inflammation.",

Universal prophylaxis involves giving antiviral therapy to all at-risk patients beginning at or immediately after transplantation for a defined period. In pre-emptive therapy, quantitative assays are used to monitor patients at predefined intervals (generally weekly for weeks 1-12) to detect early disease. Positive assays result in therapy. Pre-emptive therapy incurs extra costs for monitoring and coordination of outpatient care, while reducing the cost of drugs and the inherent toxicities. Prophylaxis has the possible advantage of not only preventing CMV infection during the period of greatest risk but also diminishing infections secondary to HHV-6, HHV-7, and EBV. The indirect effects of CMV (i.e., graft rejection, opportunistic infection) also may be reduced by routine prophylaxis. In practice, neither universal prophylaxis nor pre-emptive therapy is perfect. Many centers use a combination of both approaches: universal prophylaxis for the highestrisk recipients (D + /Rand R + with T-cell depletion), and pre-emptive therapy for others. Infrequently, breakthrough disease and ganciclovir resistance have been observed with both approaches. 1 Given the risk for invasive infection, patients at risk for primary infection (CMV D -/R -) and seropositive patients receiving depleting anti-T-lymphocyte antibodies are generally given prophylaxis for 3-6 months after transplantation. Other groups are candidates for pre-emptive therapy if an appropriate monitoring system is in place, and patient compliance is good. Current data support the use of universal prophylaxis (not pre-emptive therapy), however, in the prevention of indirect effects of CMV infection, including PTLD, opportunistic infections, allograft rejection, and mortality. 1, 42 Increasingly, \"late\" disease has been observed after the completion of prophylaxis. 38, 39 Thus, monitoring may be useful after prophylaxis. The rate of late disease varies but is thought to be as high as 17-37% in D + /Rrecipients. This observation has suggested the value of 6 months of prophylaxis in D + /Rrenal recipients (the IMPACT study).",

Valganciclovir and ganciclovir are associated with neutropenia; however, dose reduction risks breakthrough viremia and the emergence of viral resistance. Prophylaxis should be reinitiated during treatments with antilymphocyte therapies. Given changing renal function after transplantation and the costs of medication, many regimens employ lower doses of valganciclovir. Such regimens should be coupled to monitoring to assure efficacy. After the completion of treatment for CMV disease (see below), many centers initiate a course of secondary prophylaxis (1-3 months) . An alternative is a period of virologic monitoring for this period.",

The standard of care for treating invasive CMV disease is 2-4 weeks of intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg twice daily, with dosage adjustments for renal dysfunction) until a quantitative assay for CMV is negative. 40, 47, 62 In patients with mild to moderately severe symptoms, valganciclovir (900 mg po twice daily corrected for renal function) may be used as an alternative. In symptomatic patients slow to respond to therapy and who are seronegative, the addition of 3 months of CMV hyperimmune globulin in seronegative individuals (150 mg/kg/dose iv monthly) may be useful, but is costly and of uncertain benefit. Relapse does occur, primarily in seronegative patients, in those with high viral burdens, if not treated to the achievement of a negative quantitative assay, and in some with gastrointestinal disease treated with oral regimen. Repeat endoscopy should be considered to ensure the clearance of infection. In practice, it is reasonable to initiate therapy with intravenous ganciclovir, monitor weekly to assure a response, and treat until monitoring is negative. Such patients may benefit from 2-4 months of oral valganciclovir (900 mg daily based on creatinine clearance) administered as secondary prophylaxis after the completion of intravenous therapy. This approach has resulted in rare symptomatic relapses and has been associated uncommonly with the emergence of antiviral resistance. It may be worth measuring a formal creatinine clearance to assure adequate dosing. The incidence of ganciclovir resistance in CMV is generally low. 5, 11, 13 The risk for resistance is greatest in D + /Rrecipients, with higher viral loads, who received inadequate dosing of prophylactic or therapeutic ganciclovir, more intensive immunosuppression including antilymphocyte antibody induction, and with prolonged antiviral prophylaxis. Clinically, the patient's viral load or clinical syndrome fails to respond to appropriate therapy, including a reduction in immunosuppression over 10-14 days. Genetic resistance testing is useful in managing resistant CMV infection; mutations in the viral UL97 (thymidine kinase) or UL54 (DNA polymerase) genes can confer ganciclovir resistance. 32, 51 Some of the common mutations in the UL97 gene respond to higher doses of intravenous ganciclovir. Combined mutations (UL97 and UL54) may manifest high-level resistance to ganciclovir. Alternative therapies are available in intravenous form only. These include foscarnet and cidofovir. Foscarnet is active against many ganciclovir-resistant strains of CMV, although associated with marked magnesium and potassium wasting, seizures (notably with calcineurin inhibitor therapy), and some renal toxicity. Cidofovir may also be used, but often incurs significant nephrotoxicity and ocular toxicity. Liposomal cidofovir is under investigation. UL54 mutations may cause resistance to foscarnet and to cidofovir depending on the nature of the mutation. Multiple courses of antiviral therapy may be needed to cure resistant CMV infection. Given the toxicity of available medications, several investigational drugs are under study that may alter recommended therapies for antiviral-resistant CMV. Combination therapy (ganciclovir and foscarnet) may be useful, as is the addition of hyperimmune globulins. Most centers try to reduce overall immunosuppression during the course of therapy. Alternative agents include the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibitors (leflunamide) approved for immunosuppression in treatment of rheumatological diseases with useful, incidental activity against CMV (and possibly BK polyomavirus).",

BK nephropathy is rarely recognized in recipients of extrarenal organs. The clinical presentation of disease is usually as sterile pyuria, reflecting shedding of infected tubular and ureteric epithelial cells. These cells contain sheets of virus and are detected by urine cytology as \"decoy cells.\" In some cases, the patient presents with diminished renal allograft function or with ureteric stenosis and obstruction. In such patients, the etiologies of decreased renal function must be carefully evaluated (e.g., mechanical obstruction, drug toxicity, pyelonephritis, rejection, thrombosis, recurrent disease), and choices must be made between increasing immunosuppression to treat suspected graft rejection or reducing immunosuppression to allow the immune system to control infection. Patients with BK nephropathy treated with increased immunosuppression have a high incidence of graft loss. Reduced immunosuppression may stabilize renal allograft function but risks graft rejection.",

Patients with BK nephropathy have higher plasma viral loads (>7700 BK virus copies per mL of plasma, P < 0.001, 50% positive predictive value, 100% negative predictive value) when compared to patients without such disease. 34 A high serum BK viral load is considered a basis for reduction in immunosuppression, especially if serum creatinine has risen. However, the diagnosis should be made by demonstration of BK virus cytopathic changes with cellular infiltration consistent with the diagnosis of interstitial nephritis in the allograft and by immunohistology for BK virus proteins, or by in situ hybridization for BK virus nucleic acids in a renal biopsy. There is a semiquantitative scoring system for histologic changes of PVAN. For immunohistochemistry, cross-reacting antibodies against the large T-antigen of the simian virus 40 or antibodies against BK virus VP1 or agnoprotein have been used. PVAN is characterized by intranuclear polyomavirus inclusion bodies in tubular epithelial and/ or glomerular cells. Fibrosis is often prominent, occasionally with calcification.

For patients with plasma BK viral DNA loads of >4 log10 gEq/mL on duplicate testing 2-3 weeks apart, a presumptive diagnosis of PVAN should be made and immunosuppression reduced (see below).

There is a continued risk of infection in three overlapping groups of transplant recipients: (1) recipients who require higher than normal levels of immunosuppression for prolonged periods because of poor allograft function or chronic rejection; (2) recipients with chronic CMV infection; and (3) recipients undergoing treatments that increase the level of immunodeficiency, such as cancer chemotherapy or neutropenia secondary to drug toxicity.

Chest CT scans are more sensitive to the diffuse interstitial and nodular pattern than routine radiographs.

The risk of urinary tract infection after kidney transplantation is increased in women, with prolonged bladder catheterization, with increased intensity of immunosuppression, in recipients of deceased donor grafts, and, possibly, with vesicoureteral reflux. The risk for vesicoureteral reflux is dependent in part on the technical approach to implantation of the ureter taken in surgery. The risk for candiduria in particular is increased in patients who have received prior antimicrobial therapy, with neurogenic bladder, with indwelling urethral catheters, and in intensive care units.

Therapy should be guided by the presence or absence of structural abnormalities (obstruction, delayed bladder emptying) as well as by the microbiology of infection. Thus, imaging (ultrasound to exclude hydronephrosis) as well as cultures should be obtained in patients with upper tract infection. Initial empiric therapy should include antimicrobial agents not used previously for prophylaxis and, where possible, not used in prior episodes of infection given the risk for development antimicrobial resistance. The spectrum of agents can be narrowed based on susceptibility data. Short-course therapy is not recommended for treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection after transplantation. The resolution of infection should be demonstrated (7-day minimum with effective agents) and upper tract disease (at least 2-3 weeks of therapy) and may require intravenous therapy initially. Asymptomatic candiduria should be treated in patients with renal allografts (although data are limited) with fluconazole (200 mg orally per day for 7-14 days). Upper tract disease with Candida species should suggest obstruction and requires more intensive therapy (fluconazole 400 mg daily for 3-4 weeks).
