Most URTIs are caused by viruses, including influenza virus A or B (IFVA/ B), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (RV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), and human coronavirus (CoV). URTIs are common but rarely life threatening, whereas LRTIs can lead to more severe illnesses, such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis. Both of these infections can also be caused by bacterial pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and others. With the use of molecular detection techniques, simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory pathogens in patients with ARIs has been reported more frequently. 5, 6 The codetection of viral and bacterial pathogens is also quite common, especially in those less-developed countries. 7, 8 The significance of mixed detections for clinical severity is controversial with inconsistent results reported by the previous studies. The difficulties in establishing precise bacteriological or viral etiology and the frequent occurrence of mixed infections pose a challenge to medical treatment and clinical management. In the present study, we aimed to describe the detection of viruses and bacteria in hospitalized children with ARI in a subtropical city of mainland China, investigate the simultaneous detection pattern of multiple viruses and bacteria, and assess their association with clinical outcomes and severity.",

Fever caused by known chronic medical conditions was excluded. For recruited patients, nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) samples were collected on hospital admission after obtaining informed consent. We used a standardized Respiratory Syndrome Cases Information Questionnaire to collect data on demographics, underlying medical conditions, selected laboratory tests, radiographic findings, clinical manifestations, management, and outcomes. Pneumonia was defined by the presence of patchy alveolar opacities on chest radiographs, in addition to symptoms of cough, dyspnea (lower chest wall indrawing), or tachypnea (in infants, >50-60 breaths/ min; in older children, >40 breaths/min). Severe pneumonia was defined as pneumonia with hypoxemia (maintained SaO 2 < 92% in air) or rising respiratory and pulse rates with clinical evidence of respiratory distress and exhaustion with or without raised PaCO 2 .",

High codetection rate of respiratory microbial among those hospitalized pediatric ARI cases were demonstrated. Epidemiological and clinical features from single and mixed detections were described. Fever was found to be a significant predictor for codetection, whereas cases with codetection showed no significant increased severity of outcomes than monodetection in this study. This is the first study to investigate the detection and codetection pattern based on large sample size in China. The overall positive detection for any respiratory virus was 74.7%, and 22.2% for bacteria, with S pneumoniae most commonly detected in bacteria, and RSV, PIV, IFVA, and BoV among viruses, which was comparable to some other etiological studies within children or whole populations. 13-16 S pneumoniae was more often codetected with H parainfluenzae and H influenzae, and previous literature has reported the interaction between these common bacteria and suggested the mechanism like synergism or competition. 17, 18 Margolis et al 19 reported an increase of H influenzae when either S pneumoniae or Staphylococcus aureus was present, indicating synergism between these bacterial species. Previous experiments by Lysenko et al 20 observed competition between S pneumoniae and H influenzae in a mouse model of colonization. For H parainfluenzae, it is often been seen as an upper respiratory tract contaminant with other pathogens, with potential pathogenic role in lower respiratory tract in patients with severely impaired host defense. 21 In this study, it had a high chance of being codetected with other bacteria (17.8) and viruses (74.8%), which may account for the high pneumonia rate in those detections with H parainfluenzae.",

Some other studies indicated that viruses more frequently involving dual infection were RSV, INF, PIV, AdV, CoV, and RV. 22 The mixed respiratory virus detection pattern varies widely in studies, with various of combinations like RSV and IFV, RSV and PIV, IFVA and IFVB, IFVA and AdV, RSV and RV, PIV and RV, MPV and RSV, and others. [22] [23] [24] [25] Although codetection may not always result in interactions for all virus species, virus-virus interaction is quite common and have 3 potential categories (genetic, host environment, and immunological mechanisms), which is critical for understanding of viral etiology and pathogenesis. 26 The pathogens more frequently involving mixed detection of both virus and bacteria were S pneumoniae, RSV, PIV, IFVA, BoV, and RV. There were lots of studies that found that IFVA and RSV infections result in a predisposition to S pneumoniae, and H influenzae, which accounted for a substantial burden of morbidity and mortality. [27] [28] [29] Some of the literature which reported codetection of RSV and S pneumoniae indicated that the underlying mechanism was RSV infection that could enhance adherence of S pneumoniae to human epithelial cells. 30, 31 In addition, IFVA and S pneumoniae codetection was also frequently reported, with S pneumoniae playing a role as complication during the previous influenza pandemics and contribute substantially to morbidity and mortality. [32] [33] [34] Other studies have reported the concomitant presence of S pneumoniae with other respiratory viruses, such as RV, MPV, and ADV, with similar interaction. [35] [36] [37] [38] The mechanism by which viruses affect bacterial colonization and invasion is quite diverse in the previous literature, as it is multidimensional and involves a complex interplay among various hosts and pathogens. 18 The large sample size allows us to perform the multivariate analysis, thus to acquire epidemiological and clinical features of the viruses/bacteria codetection. We found that the virus detection rate was higher among children aged <4, especially, those aged <1, which is consistent with some other studies on different population. 13, 22, 39 However, bacteria detection and codetection of virus and bacteria were highest among those aged 1 to 4 years, whereas another study found that the mixed virus-bacterial infection was most common in children aged <2 years. 40 Our data also indicated that males had higher detection and codetection rate of virus and bacteria than females, and this sex difference was similarly reported in the previous literature. 39, 41 The sex difference might be due to the effect of health-seeking behaviors or sex-specific risk for respiratory infection, which needs further study.",

Our study found that there was no significant higher risk of pneumonia, severe pneumonia, and ICU admission for all codetections compared with monodetections based on the logistic regression adjusted for age and sex. However, some other studies revealed that some codetection did increase the severity of the respiratory illnesses, such as higher risk of sever pneumonia, longer hospital stays, and higher ICU admission. [44] [45] [46] [47] Some historical influenza pandemics had bacterial superinfections with increased mortality, most of which involving secondary pneumococcal pneumonia. 33, 48 Another study indicated the viral-bacterial coinfection, especially, S pneumoniae may cause most severe human MPV infection processing to pneumonia. 35 Some other studies found that the outcomes including mortality that associated with bacterial-viral coinfection were not significantly different. 49, 50 Furthermore, there were a few studies that found the opposite result, such as RSV coinfections were inversely associated with hospitalization and RV-coinfected patients had less-severe disease. 51, 52 Conflicting results may be due to several factors, such as the study periods, target population, and environment factors. What is more, the presence of pathogens tested by molecular techniques or conventional culture may not confirm significant pathogenic role at that time. As viral-bacterial coinfection may lead to failure of the antibiotic therapy, this poses a challenge to efficient and effective treatments for those patients. Better understanding the pattern of mixed infection and their interaction, and assessing the clinical severity will be helpful for designing successful therapeutic strategies. Better and more sensitive etiologic diagnostic tool for respiratory microbial infection can reduce overuse of antibiotic in primary care.",

First, the database of this study included limited information on the disease outcomes (eg, the death records), thus may underestimate the severity and disease burden. Second, the use of antibiotics might obscure the real association between these viral and bacterial detections in this study. Third, for the sputum as we had no information on the bacterial load of these positive detected cases, quantitative comparison could not be implemented in this study. Fourth, 79% of the cases had sputum culture results, with 667 cases undetected for bacteria, which may lead to underestimation of the bacterial burden. On the other hand, sputum might be contaminated by upper airway tract secretions, leading to overestimation. Last, the detection of the pathogens does not mean that it is the cause of the illness, thus it is difficult to determine the real cause of the patients' illness.",
