Evaluation of this situation requires an understanding of the common etiologies, which are associated with the demographics of travelers and the destinations. Methods: We conducted a 5-year prospective observational study on the etiologies of fever in travelers returning from the tropics admitted to the infectious and tropical diseases unit of a university teaching hospital in Marseilles, France. Results: A total of 613 patients were enrolled, including 364 migrants (59.4%), 126 travelers (20.6%), 37 visitors (6%), 24 expatriates (3.9%), and 62 patients (10.1%) who could not be classified. Malaria was the most common diagnosis (75.2%), with most cases (62%) acquired by migrants from the Comoros archipelago and who had traveled to these islands to visit friends and relatives. Agents of food-borne and water-borne infections (3.9%) and respiratory tract infections (3.4%) were also frequently identified as the cause of fever. Other infections included emerging diseases such as gnathostomiasis, hepatitis E infection and rickettsial diseases, as well as common infections or exotic diseases. Conclusions: Although we have identified here various causes of imported fever, 8.2% of the fevers remained unexplained. An improved approach to diagnosis may allow for the discovery of new diseases in travelers in the future. Q (P.

            "text": "Millions of people from industrialized countries travel abroad and visit tropical developing countries every year. In spite of recent international problems such as the 2003 SARS epidemic, terrorist attacks, and the Iraq conflict, the popularity of international travel continues to grow, and short-term tourism data for the first half of 2004 confirms the upward trend already evident by the end of 2003. 1 During their trips, travelers expose themselves to various illnesses including routine diseases acquired while traveling, as well as infectious or tropical diseases directly related to the travel. 2 It has been estimated that up to 50% of travelers visiting developing countries experience a health problem related to their trip. 2 Furthermore, 3-11% of travelers to tropical areas report a febrile illness on their return. 3 This may pose a diagnostic challenge for Western physicians who are frequently involved in the assessment of these patients but unfamiliar with tropical diseases. Thus, patients with fever after returning from the tropics are often admitted to the hospital. 3 Evaluation of this situation requires an understanding of the common etiologies, which are associated with the demographics of travelers and the destinations. We undertook a prospective study to analyze the cause of fevers in travelers returning from tropical areas and admitted to the Infectious and Tropical Diseases Unit at the North University Hospital in Marseilles, France, in 1999-2003.",

When this hospital closed by the end of 2000, the unit moved to the North Hospital, which is located however, near the previous one. The North Hospital is an 800-bed universityaffiliated teaching hospital, and the Tropical Diseases Unit is currently the reference center for tropical diseases in Marseilles, southern France. Only adults and children older than 15 years old are hospitalized in this unit. Younger children are hospitalized in the pediatric unit. 4 Data were collected prospectively in medical records, and included a standard questionnaire completed by medical students and attending physicians. Patients were included in the study if they were hospitalized with fever during the study period, and had a history of travel and/or residence in a tropical country in the 6 months prior to admission or claimed that their symptoms were related to a travel with no limit of time. All investigations were ordered at the discretion of the attending physician. However, in 2002 a systematic procedure for laboratory investigation was used for all patients (C. Foucault, unpublished). The benefit of such a procedure will be discussed elsewhere.",

For malaria cases, the regimen used to treat the patients was recorded. Diagnoses were established by demonstration of microorganism(s) in a clinically relevant specimen or by seroconversion to an infectious disease agent that was considered to be responsible of the travel-related illness. If a specific organism could not be identified, a clinical diagnosis was assigned. Malaria cases were recorded as uncomplicated or severe according the WHO definition. 5 By reviewing medical records, information was recorded on a standard format and analysed by Epi Info, version 6 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, USA).

            "text": "The evaluation of fever in the returned traveler requires an understanding of the common etiologies encountered by the population of travelers, which may include local specificities. 2 To our knowledge, we present here the largest prospective study of patients who were hospitalized in one site for the assessment of febrile illness acquired overseas. Indeed, the data of 613 patients consecutively admitted over a period of 5 years were recorded in a specific medical record (called 'travel medical record') including a standard format. The only larger prospective study that we could find through a medline research was a 4-year prospective study conducted at the emergency department of a French hospital, and included 783 inpatient and outpatient adults. 6 In our study, criteria of admission to our unit were not predefined. They were based on the judgement of the physician on duty, those who saw the returned patients at the emergency rooms, and infectious diseases physicians seeing the patients who first presented at the tropical diseases outpatients clinic before being hospitalized. All of them have however, the instructions to admit systematically patients with falciparum malaria. In our study, malaria was the cause of the fever in 75.2% of the 613 returned patients. Therefore, it was by far the most common cause of fever, as reported in other similar studies. 3,6-10 Plasmodium falciparum was the most commonly identified species (91.3%), which mirrors the national French records, 11 and more generally the European records. 12 The risk to travelers of acquiring malaria is known to vary according to the destination. 13 Most of our cases were acquired in Comoros Islands (62%) and sub-Saharan Africa (31.5%). Furthermore, febrile patients who returned from the Comoros archipelago or the African mainland were significantly more likely to present with malaria. This is attributed to the fact that the majority of our patients are migrants (59.4%), and that most of the migrants originated from Comoros Islands (84%), and less frequently Western Africa (9%). Indeed, in recent years, a growing proportion of imported malaria has been seen in migrants, both in Europe and America . 13 These migrants include newcomers and refugees, but even more frequently residents who return to their countries of origin to visit friends and relatives (VFR). In a recent review of reports describing more than 250 cases and published between 1991 and 2001, the proportion of migrants in malaria cases in Europe varied from 33% in the United Kingdom to 60% in Italy and 86% in France 14 . Interestingly, this last study was conducted in our hospital, in the paediatrics unit. 15 On pooling the reports, 43% of the cases registered in major European centre occurred in migrants and VFRs make up the dominant group. 14 The Comoros archipelago includes four Islands located in the Indian Ocean covering 2300 km 2 with a population of some 726,000 inhabitants. Three islands form the Comoros Union (formerly Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros), independent since 1975, whereas Mayotte Island has remained a French territory. In spite of malaria control programs, falciparum malaria still constitutes a major public health problem in the Comoros Union. 16 There have been two waves of immigration from Comoros to France. The first started before 1970 and the second followed the independence of the three islands after 1975. In Marseilles, the population of people originating from Comoros has been estimated at 50,000-70,000 inhabitants, although the precise number is difficult to assess. Further, it has been estimated that 4000-5000 people originating from Comoros and living in France are traveling back to Comoros every year, primarily to visit friends and relatives. 17 Based on self reports available for 304 (94%) of 324 patients who had returned from the Comoros Archipelago, most of them did not use a chemoprophylaxis regimen or took inadequate regimens. Only one patient (0.33%) took an adequate regimen (mefloquine) regularly during and after the trip as currently recommended by the French health authorities 18 . However, drug levels were not measured to confirm the claim of this patient. The poor compliance to malaria chemoprophylaxis in migrants returning to their country of origin to visit friends and relatives corroborates with other reports in the literature 13, 14 . The reasons for poor compliance include the lack of information, as well as the misconception in continued immunity against malaria because of birth in Comoros, and the relatively high cost of the drugs recommended for chemoprophylaxis. As discussed recently, an improved approach to educate the Comorian population in Marseilles regarding malaria risks and prophylaxis needs to be explored and include the contribution of social and medical anthropology 17 . Following Plasmodium spp., dengue fever virus was the second most common identified pathogen responsible of fever in our travelers, with 13 cases. Dengue fever represented 2.1% of the diagnoses among our febrile patients, 19% of those returning from South-America and West Indies, and 20% of those who had returned from Southeastern Asia. Dengue virus was also identified as the second most frequent cause of fever in returned travelers in two recent studies conducted in Australia 8 and in Italy 3 . Interestingly, 3 of our dengue cases (23%) were acquired during a trip to sub-Saharan Africa. In recently reported reviews of dengue cases diagnosed in Europe, 10.3-21% of cases came from Africa 19, 20 . Dengue fever is now recognized as a global pandemic with recorded prevalence in 101 countries in Central and South America, Asia, Pacific, Australia, and Africa 21 . Interestingly, one of our patient had dengue fever associated with shigellosis 22 .",

Among the studies analyzed in this review, one had been performed prospectively among 104 young long-term travelers (at least 3 months) from Israel to various endemic areas 23 . Dengue seroconversion was reported in 6.7% of all travelers with a median of 5.3 months' stay abroad; four travelers (3.8%) had immunoglobulin (Ig) M antibodies, all after a trip to Southeast Asia; three out of seven infection were asymptomatic 23 . Another prospective study conducted in a cohort of Dutch short-term travellers to endemic areas in Asia during 1991-92 included collection of sera before and after travel 24 . The authors reported an incidence rate of probable infection (IgM seroconversion or a fourfold rise in IgG ratio in the absence of cross-reaction with antibody to Japanese encephalitis virus) of 30/1000 persons/months, with a clinical/subclinical ratio of 1:3.3 24 . Higher incidence rates have been reported during epidemics. In August 1995, a dengue virus outbreak among participants in a community-assistance program in Tortola, British Virgin Islands, Caribbean, resulted in an attack rate was reaching 69% 25 . Non-Caucasian travellers may have a higher risk for developing dengue hemorrhagic fever than Caucasian travellers 21 . Finally, the role of travelers to introduce more virulent strains (subtypes) into areas where only mild disease had been observed (such as Sri Lanka), or to introduce the virus to non-endemic areas where the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti is prevalent, has been recently discussed 21 .",

This is not surprising as gastrointestinal illnesses, particularly diarrhea, are the most commonly reported disorders in travelers 2 . Gastroenteritis was the second leading cause of fever in most of the studies recently reviewed 3 . In febrile patients, gastrointestinal symptoms can be caused by bacteria responsible for invasion of the mucosal lining of the intestines, including Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp., as observed in our patients. Fever is uncommon in E. histolitica infections, with the exception of hepatic amebiasis, as reported here. Of significance is the fact that S. typhi, the causative agent of typhoid fever, is the leading etiologic agent responsible for food-and water-borne infections in our patients. None of the patients had been given typhoid vaccine. Antinori et al. noted a similar trend 3 . Typhoid fever is diagnosed with an incidence rate of 30/100,000 per month among travelers to the Indian subcontinent, North and West Africa (except Tunisia) and Peru. Elsewhere this rate has been estimated to be 10-fold lower 26 . Tourists as well as VFRs are affected 26 .

Overall anti-hepatitis A virus seroprevalence was 11.5%.

From 1991 to 1996, 415 cases of acute hepatitis A were reported and travel was the primary risk factor (25%) 28 . Hepatitis A is the most frequent vaccine-preventable infection in non-immune travelers to developing countries with an average incidence rate of 300/100,000 per month, up to 2000/100,000 in back-packers and foreign-aid volunteers 26 . Children born to migrants living in France and travelling back to the family's country of origin are particularly vulnerable. The Asian and African region bordering the Mediterranean and the Caribbean have been classified as destinations with moderate to high risk of infection by WHO 26 . Currently, the efficacy of hepatitis A vaccination is close to 100% 29 . In France, the vaccine is now recommended in unimmunized adults and children over the age of one year traveling to endemic areas, and more generally for all travelers to all countries with poor sanitation level. Serologic testing prior to vaccination is recommended only for persons born before 1945, for those residing in medium-high endemic areas, and those with a medical history of jaundice 18 . In Switzerland, the 'universal travel strategy' for hepatitis A vaccination was associated with a 9-year reduction rate of 54% 29 .",

However, HEV rarely causes disease in more industrialized countries, where most of the cases are related to travel.

Half of these patients were hospitalized in 2003 after returning from Southeast Asia to exclude the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 33 . The SARS outbreak has recently focused global attention on respiratory tract infection in returned travellers 34 35 . These data highlighted the susceptibility of travelers to infectious respiratory pathogens even before the SARS epidemic. Possible respiratory problems included viral upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, viral and bacteria pneumonia, followed by uncommon or more 'exotic' causes 2 . More recently, the medical records of travelers who had returned with pneumonia and who had been hospitalized in Paris in a French Hospital from August 2001 to July 2002, were reviewed 36 . A total of 17 patients were studied. The authors reported a high rate of etiologic diagnosis (76.5%), that they explain by their inclusion criteria, 'severe disease or unexplained cause' 36 . They reported L. pneumophila and M. pneumoniae, as reported in our study 3 . They also diagnosed Streptococcus pneumoniae, Leptospira sp., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Histoplasma capsulatum and Schistosomia sp. as well as agents that were in our study responsible for syndromes other than respiratory infections, such as Coxiella burnetii, the agent of Q fever, and dengue virus 36 . Although Legionnaire's disease is now recognized as a relatively common cause of pneumonia in travelers, particularly after sea cruises 37 , most of the causes of respiratory tract infections in travelers are not identified, particularly when patients are not hospitalized. A systematic procedure for laboratory investigation is on going for all patients admitted in our unit. The benefit of such a procedure to diagnose respiratory tract infections will be evaluated in the upcoming months.",

These diseases may include tick-borne spotted fever group rickettsioses, murine typhus, epidemic typhus, scrub typhus and Q fever. Although C. burnetii, the agent of Q fever has been removed from the Rickettsiales, Q fever is often still considered in the differential of rickettsial diseases. In the past, we have reported a case imported from Senegal 43 . In the present study, one case occurred in a traveller who had returned from French Guyana, South America. A second case was associated with falciparum malaria in a patient returning from Comoros. It should be remembered that Q fever may present with isolated fever 44 . Furthermore, a recent review found 400 cases of tick-borne spotted fever group rickettsioses in international travellers, the vast majority being African tick bite fever caused by R. africae and Mediterranean spotted fever caused by R. conorii 45 . The present study reported only two cases because most of our patients with tick-borne rickettsioses are seen as outpatients; however, these cases were sufficiently severe to require hospitalisation. One case was reported as the first serologically documented case of Indian tick typhus in a returned traveler 46 . Our study did not detect any flea-borne murine typhus due to R. typhi, or scrub typhus due to Orientia tsutsugamushi transmitted by chiggers, although these diseases are potential causes of fever in returned travelers 47, 48 . Finally, the louse-borne epidemic typhus due to R. prowazekii can also present as fever in migrants from countries where they were living in poor conditions, as we reported in the past 49 .

Malaria was shown to be by far the most frequent cause of fever. Migrants who visited friends and relatives in their country of origin appeared to be at high risk, as shown in other recent studies. Our study highlights the need to adapt travel advices and chemoprophylaxis to the community of migrants. In our city, it includes a large proportion of people originated from the Comoros archipelago. Thus, our data may not be representative for other centers in Europe or anywhere. However, these centers may face similar situation with others specific communities of migrants. Finally, although we have identified here emerging diseases, 8.2% of the fevers remained unexplained. An improved approach to diagnosis may allow for the discovery of new diseases in travelers in the future.",
