One hundred and seventyfour of these sites existed in two or more SARS-CoV genome sequences. According to the sequence polymorphism, all SARS-CoVs can be divided into three groups: (I) group 1, animal-origin viruses (such as SARS-CoV SZ1, SZ3, SZ13 and SZ16); (II) group 2, all viruses with clinical origin during first epidemic; and (III) group 3, SARS-CoV GD03T0013. According to 10 special loci, group 2 again can be divided into genotypes C and T, which can be further divided into subgenotypes C1-C4 and T1-T4. Positive Darwinian selections were identified between any pair of these three groups. Genotype C gives neutral selection. Genotype T, however, shows negative selection. By comparing the death rates of SARS patients in the different regions, it was found that the death rate caused by the viruses of the genotype C was lower than that of the genotype T. SARS-CoVs might originate from an unknown ancestor. FEBS Letters 579 (2005) 4928-4936 FEBS 29875 c B J 3 0 2 -1 B J 3 0 2 -6 B J 3 0 2 -3 B J 3 0 2 -4 B J 3 0 2 -2 B J 3 0 2 -8",

            "text": "In 2002, a new infectious disease was found in the southern part of China which had high mortality and morbidity and was termed ''severe acute respiratory syndrome'' (SARS). It affected 8096 people and led 774 patients to death around the world, within a very short span of time [1] . Several studies have shown that SARS is caused by a new member of the coronavirus family. The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was supposed to be transmitted from wild animals [2] [3] [4] . This hypothesis was then supported by the identification of a SARS-CoV-like virus in civet cats, sold in markets in south China. This isolate had more than 99% sequence identity with SARS-CoV, indicating that the virus was recently transferred from animals to human beings [5] . However, according to a recent report there is no direct evidence that the civet cat virus is the origin of the SARS-CoV [6] . Although unlikely, the possibility that SARS-CoV positive animals were infected from humans cannot be formally excluded, and it was indeed reported that SARS-CoV was transmitted from man to pig [7] . The mechanism how the pathogen broke the barrier between its natural reservoir and man is still unclear [8] .",

SARS-CoV Su-10 and CUHK-W1 were genotyped into two different groups even though they were all isolated in Hongkong [17] . Based on the 7 loci of 44 SARS-CoV genomes, C and T genotypes were further modified and named as the Yexin and Xiaohong genotypes [18] . According to 5 polymorphism sites, 63 SARS-CoV genomes were divided into early, middle and late phase genotype groups [19] . The polymorphism sites analyzed in these papers were almost the same.",

To avoid errors that might be introduced by sequencing and cell culture passages, only the latter group of 174 loci was analyzed. Different characteristics of the polymorphism sites were found. The loci related to T mutation accounted for 60.9% (106/174), and C, A and G mutation loci accounted for 39.6% (69/174), 39.0% (68/174) and 27.0% (47/174), respectively. It was obvious that T mutation had the priority. Most of the loci, except for 7 sites, were limited to one pair of nucleotide variations. One hundred and twenty loci were transition mutations (78 CT, 42 AG), and 48 loci were transversion mutations.

The characteristic of the genotype C was that the genomes had at least one position with the same nucleotide as 10 loci listed above (C:C:G:G:A:C:G:G:T:C). These genomes included GD01, ZS-C, CUHK-W1, BJ01, BJ302-1 and GZ-C, etc. The characteristic of the genotype T was that the genomes must have all the 10 nucleotides of T:T:T:A:G:T:A:T:C:T. This genotype included GZ-B, ZJ01, Sin2679, Urbani, TC1, CUHK-AG01, Sino1-11, TOR2 and AS, etc. These polymorphism sites were located in 5 different regions of the replicase 1A, 1B, spike protein gene, sars6 and sars8a. Except the 4th and the 7th loci that were synonymous mutations, the others were non-synonymous mutations with amino acid changes of A/V, A/V, E/D, G/D, T/I, D/Y, P/L and R/C, respectively. It revealed the strongly biased characteristic of changes in genotypes associated with changes in phenotypes. Genotype C can be further divided into 4 sub-genotypes. Sub-genotype C1 had, besides the 10 sites mentioned above (Table 3) , C3626T, C8559T, T22207C and G22522A loci that would distinguish them from the others. In the same way, sub-genotype C2 had G3962A, G9448T and T19882C and sub-genotype C4 had T9854C site. As shown in Fig. 1 , the sub-genotype C3 is a transitional one. Genotype T could also be divided into 4 subgenotypes, sub-genotype T1, T2, T3 and T4. Besides the 10 common polymorphism sites shown above, they had 3, 4, 4 and 3 variant loci, respectively (Table 3) . ZJ01, HSR1 and Sin2679, belonging to genotype T and with more polymorphism sites identified in their genomes, located in the midst of the phylogenetic tree ( Fig. 1 ) and were not sub-genotyped in this paper (Table 3) .

Some presented the regional and international transmission types according to the epidemic regions and some divided the viruses into early, middle, and late phase groups according to the time of the SARS epidemic in a certain region (Guangdong of China). Based on genome characteristics of 145 SARS-CoVs, a new concept of three groups, two genotypes and eight subtypes was established. The genotype C of group 2 in this work was almost compatible with the regional transmission type and the early, middle phase groups, while genotype T of group 2 was compatible with the international transmission type and the late phase group as well [16, 19] . One of the advantages of the new classification is that it fits global and regional epidemic feature analysis, such as for SARS-CoVs in Taiwan and Singapore. Up to date, all the genomes from clinical samples in the early, middle, and late phase of the SARS epidemic in these regions belonged to genotype T. The concept of dividing all SARS-CoVs into three groups was mainly based on the phylogenetic analysis and the positive Darwinian selection. Because of the limited virus number in group 1 and 3, this grouping has to be further confirmed.",

The origins of each sub-genotype were also elucidated [22] [23] [24] and are consistent with our results. But the origin of the SARS-CoV remains a question and needs further investigation. Zhao et al. [25] analyzed 16 SARS-CoV genomes and proposed that the closest common ancestor might have existed during the spring of 2002 which is consistent with the date, May 2002, estimated by the spike gene synonymous mutation rate of the three groups in this work. It is very probable that the three groups originated from an unknown common ancestor.",

According to genome sequence variation analysis, genotype shifts of SARS-CoVs in the main epidemic regions during the first epidemic were obvious. The sub-genotypes C1 and C2, that have a closer relationship to the virus of animal origin, first appeared in Guangdong, and then appeared the sub-genotype C3. The dominant viruses in HongKong were of genotype T, but genotype C also appeared there. Similarly, although sub-genotype C4 dominated in Beijing, genotype T also existed there. In Singapore, they had all the genomes of genotypes T, mostly of sub-genotypes T1 and T2. The viruses in Taiwan were all of genotype T, mostly of sub-genotype T4. With more SARS-CoV genome sequences and more complete epidemiological data released, the characteristics of the SARS-CoV\u00d5s variations in the genotypes, as well as the features about the epidemic phases, the epidemic regions, the clinical symptoms, and the viruses\u00d5 adaptation to the human host, will become clearer and clearer.",

SARS-CoV GD03T0013 was from the patient with ''mild clinical symptoms'', and its genome sequence was similar to that of the sub-genotype C1. Experiments have also demonstrated that SARS-CoVs of the genotype T had a stronger ability to cause cyto-pathogenic effects (CPE) than those of the genotype C. The CPE of the genotype T remained stable during passages in cell cultures [26] . In the first epidemic, SARS patients in Guangzhou seldom suffered from diarrhea, and the SARS-CoV genomes were mainly of the genotype C [27] . The majority of SARS patients in Hongkong, however, suffered from diarrhea and it turned out that SARS-CoVs of the genotype T dominated [28] . SARS-CoVs of different genotypes might have different virulence. Moreover, the serum from mice immunized with inactivated SARS-CoV BJ01 of genotype C is able to neutralize the invasiveness of SARS-CoV BJ01 itself into Vero cells [29] . Further investigations are required to demonstrate whether this serum could prevent the cells from the invasiveness of the SARS-CoV PUMC01 or others of the genotype T.",
