However, no antigen detection assay for commercial use is available for diagnosis. In this study, the full-length nucleocapsid protein (NP) gene of MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. A MERS-CoV NP capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using two MERS-CoV-NP-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) generated was developed. The ELISA was evaluated using 129 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) positive for various respiratory viruses and simulated positive NPAs by adding serial dilutions of MERS-CoV. Using a cutoff OD of 0.19, all 129 NPAs positive for respiratory viruses showed very low OD, with a specificity of 100%. For the two simulated MERS-CoV-positive NPAs with serial dilutions of live MERS-CoV, all samples with o10 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 )/0.1 mL showed positive results. For the 10 additional NPAs with 20 and 200 TCID 50 /0.1 mL of live MERS-CoV added, all were positive. A highly sensitive and specific MAbs-based antigen capture ELISA has been developed for MERS. This sensitive and specific antigen capture ELISA should be useful for detection of MERS-CoV in human and dromedaries and in field studies.",

Similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), MERS is also caused by a coronavirus (CoV), named MERS-CoV; 1-4 but unlike the SARS epidemic which has rapidly died off after the intermediate amplification animal hosts were segregated from humans by closure of wild animal markets in southern China, the MERS epidemic has persisted for more than two years with no signs of abatement. The persistence of the epidemic may be partly due to the difficulty to control the contact between the people and dromedary camels, a major zoonotic source of MERS-CoV. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Since there is still no effective anti-viral agent for the treatment of MERS-CoV infections, rapid and accurate laboratory diagnosis is essential for commencement of infection control measures.",

            "text": "Although MERS-CoV can be cultured and antibody detection methods are available, laboratory diagnosis of human MERS-CoV infections is mainly achieved by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, using the RNAdependent RNA polymerase, the region upstream to the envelope gene or the nucleocapsid gene of MERS-CoV as the target. [10] [11] [12] [13] However, the cost of quantitative real-time RT-PCR is still high and such expertise may not be available, particularly in the clinical microbiology laboratories in the Middle East where most of the cases were identified. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for antigen detection offers an inexpensive and user-friendly way for laboratory diagnosis of respiratory viral infections, including SARS. 14, 15 As for MERS, antigen detection ELISA will be useful not only for laboratory diagnosis of patients with suspected MERS but also for field studies on dromedaries as well as other suspected animal reservoirs. So far, such an antigen detection assay is not available for MERS-CoV. In this article, we report the development and evaluation of a monoclonal antibody (MAb)-based capture ELISA for MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (NP) detection.",

After the final booster dose, the spleens of the mice were removed, and splenocytes were fused with the mouse myeloma cell line Sp2/0-Ag-14. Culture supernatant from individual hybridoma clones was then screened against purified MERS-CoV-rNP by ELISA. After subcloning three times by limiting dilution, stable hybridoma cells were injected into the abdominal cavity of a mouse to produce ascitic fluid. The MAbs were purified first by precipitating with 50% ammonium sulfate, then with diethylaminoethyl column by high performance liquid chromatography. The concentrations of purified IgG were determined by their absorbance at OD 280 .

Our previous experience on SARS-CoV has shown that SARS-CoV-NP detection in SARS patients is highly feasible using an antigen capture ELISA-based method. 14, 15 Since NP is also an important, highly immunogenic and abundantly expressed structural protein in MERS-CoV, its detection using similar principles should also be feasible. The NP protein is a more preferable target than the S protein because the NP protein is present in much higher amount than the S protein. In this study, using hyperimmune sera obtained from mice immunized with three doses of MERS-CoV-rNP, we confirmed that MERS-CoV-NP is abundantly present in inactivated MERS-CoV cell cultures (Figure 2 ). The antigen capture ELISA was designed using two different MAbs (1F6 and 7C4) with high and specific antibody titers against MERS-CoV-rNP ( Figure 3 ). As half of the 24 MAbs generated showed different degrees of cross-reactivity against HCoV-229E and/or HCoV-OC43, suggesting the possibility of common epitopes across the different CoVs, this MAbs-based ELISA should be much more specific than a polyclonal antibodies-based ELISA using hyperimmune sera generated from two different kinds of animals immunized with MERS-CoV-rNP. In addition to the high specificity, we also observed that MERS-CoV-rNP and MERS-CoV-NP can be detected by the present assay with a protein and inactivated viral concentrations of as low as 1 ng/mL and 10 3 TCID 50 /mL respectively ( Figure 4) .",

Although the ancestral origin of MERS-CoV is believed to be from bats, [29] [30] [31] dromedaries are likely to be the immediate animal reservoir for transmission of MERS-CoV to human. High titers of antibodies to MERS-CoV have been detected in more than 95% of adult dromedaries in the Middle East, 5, 9, 32, 33 and MERS-CoV have also been found from the nasal samples of a small proportion of dromedaries. 8, [34] [35] [36] As MERS-CoV was also detected in the nasal samples in dromedaries with viral loads of around 10 4 to 10 6 copies/mL, 37 the present ELISA should be readily useful for detecting MERS-CoV in dromedaries. To prevent MERS infections as well as in cases of MERS outbreaks, it may be necessary to screen and isolate dromedaries that are actively shedding MERS-CoV. Since the present ELISA captures MERS-CoV-NP antigen, it should be able to detect MERS-CoV regardless of the source of the specimen, and should be extremely useful for assessing viral shedding patterns in dromedaries as well as searching for other animal sources of MERS-CoV.",

So far, most patients with MERS either resided in or had recent travel histories to the Middle East. Therefore, a MERS diagnostic test developed should be able to be used in clinical microbiology laboratories in the Middle East. As for the animal reservoirs, the infected dromedaries also live in the Middle East as well as North Africa. Compared to quantitative real-time RT-PCR, the consumable cost of the present antigen capture ELISA is lower. It also does not require expertise on molecular technology and the expensive set-up for molecular studies, which may not be present in most clinical microbiology laboratories in the Middle East. For example, about 15 million people, including more than two million pilgrims, visit Mecca in Saudi Arabia every year. In particular, a high concentration of visitors is expected during the Hajj period. A user-friendly laboratory test would be necessary for handling such a large number of exposed people as well as potential outbreaks because of mass gathering. Therefore, the present ELISA is likely to be more suitable than quantitative real-time RT-PCR for the use in laboratories in the Middle East and North Africa, where resources and expertise could be limited. As for animals, this test would be extremely useful for tracking the transmission patterns of MERS-CoV among the dromedaries in the same farm as well as across different countries. Further refinement of the test and the development of a rapid antigen detection kit for on-the-spot diagnosis are warranted.",

As there have been no imported MERS cases in Hong Kong so far and we do not have access to any MERS patient samples, we used simulated NPAs spiked with live MERS-CoV for evaluation. Since the assay is able to detect simulated NPA samples with viral load as low as 10 TCID 50 /0.1 mL of live MERS-CoV, this diagnostic tool should be suitable for early diagnosis of MERS, since the viral loads in NPAs of patients during acute infection are usually around 10 6 copies/mL.27,28",
