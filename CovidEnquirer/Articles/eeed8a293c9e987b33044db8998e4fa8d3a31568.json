Despite numerous trials and decades of research, vaccines have limited efficacy particularly for calves. As an alternative method of controlling infection, we have investigated broad spectrum antiviral agents that are not discriminatory among various viruses. This report involves testing a variety of adsorbent agents including charcoal, clay, and clay minerals to adsorb rotavirus and coronavirus in vitro. Results revealed that all the adsorbent agents had good to excellent capability of adsorbing rotavirus and excellent capability of adsorbing coronavirus. Percent adsorptions ranged from 78.74% to 99.89% for rotavirus and 99.99% for coronavirus; while sand (negative control) was <0.01%. A high affinity binding was present as determined by a low percent desorption (0.06\u00b13.09%). However, the adsorbent bound virus complex retained, and may have actually enhanced, infectivity. #",

Gastroenteritis primarily effects neonatal but also adult animals, birds and humans and is a major cause of disease and often death worldwide. Viruses, bacteria, protozoa, toxins and heavy metals are among the unrelated causes of the disease but environmental, immunological, and nutritional factors play an important role as well. To date, viruses that are implicated in this disease complex include adenoviruses, astroviruses, calicivirus-like agents, coronaviruses, parvoviruses, rotaviruses, and toroviruses. It has been shown that viruses are among the most common agents associated with diarrhea of children, calves, (House, 1978; Woode and Crouch, 1978; Tzipori, 1981 Tzipori, , 1985 Bern and Glass, 1994) and foals (Dwyer et al., 1991) .",

The livestock industry carries a great financial burden due to the animal deaths and costs associated with prevention and treatment of disease as a result of infections by these two viruses. In epizootic infections of rotavirus, morbidity rates can be as high as 80\u00b1100% and although mortality rates are usually in the range of 0\u00b15% they can be as high as 60%. Mortality rates are probably dependent upon the virulence of the virus strain, other pathogens present, and the host's phenotype and genotype.

Yet, despite the numerous trials and decades of research, effective vaccines are still not available for these or other viral agents that cause gastroenteritis. Although, research efforts have appeared promising, vaccine field trials continue to produce inadequate results or fail entirely (de Leeuw et al., 1980; Myers and Snodgrass, 1982; Snodgrass et al., 1982; Waltner-Toews et al., 1985; Yuan et al., 1998) . The inadequacy of rotavirus vaccines may be explained, in part, by the complex antigenic diversity of the group A rotaviruses (Woode et al., , 1987 Zheng et al., 1989; Hardy et al., 1991; Parwani et al., 1993; , and by doubts concerning which of the two main antigens, VP4 or VP7, is the most important antigen to induce immune protection (Ward et al., 1993; . In addition, immunizing neonates with modified live rotavirus or coronavirus vaccine is difficult because of interference by colostral antibodies which contain neutralizing activity and effectively block the host's immune response (Waltner-Toews et al., 1985) . Post infection, the only treatment available is supportive therapy such as fluid replacement. Thus, viral gastroenteritis is still largely uncontrolled at present.",

More recently, a new approach has been directed towards the use of clays and clay minerals to alter the bio-availability of toxins. A hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate clay (HSCAS) has been found to bind aflatoxins and when added to the food greatly reduces the adverse effects of aflatoxin in Leghorn and broiler chicks (Phillips et al., 1988) . Various clays have also been shown to adsorb and inactivate the thermo-labile (LT) enterotoxins of Escherichia coli and the cholera toxin (CT) enterotoxins of Vibrio cholerae which has been reviewed recently (Ramu et al., 1997) . There is also evidence of virus adsorption to clays; the viruses most studied include poliovirus, encephalomyocarditis virus and reovirus (Kelly et al., 1961; Schaub and Sagik, 1975; Taylor et al., 1981; Lipson and Stotzky, 1983; Preston and Farrah, 1988) .

We have characterized a high affinity binding as an adsorbent material that has a high percent adsorption of virus and a low percent desorption. The structure of the adsorbent materials is very complex and the relationship of binding is not completely understood. However, the diameter of rotavirus and coronavirus particles are 60\u00b180 and 60\u00b1220 nm, respectively which are significantly larger than the pores of the adsorbent material particles. Therefore, the virions must be attached to the outer surface of each adsorbent particle. Furthermore, we believe this interaction to be a non-specific binding of protein. This is supported by the binding of viruses including rotavirus, coronavirus, poliovirus, reovirus, and enterovirus, CT and LT enterotoxins, and casein which was found to block the adsorption of CT and LT enterotoxins which has been reviewed previously (Ramu et al., 1997) .",

            "text": "Adsorbent materials appear promising as a method of adsorbing virus from solution and may be useful as such in filtering aqueous systems. They may have a distinct advantage in prevention of infection and/or disease because most agents that cause gastroenteritis, including rotavirus and coronavirus, are generally contracted orally, usually via contaminated food and water. According to our studies, adsorbent materials will allow between 1% and 10% of virions to remain in solution. As a result they may not eliminate infection but may eliminate water borne disease by effectively reducing the infectious dose by greater than 90%. It was our hypothesis that the prophylactic use of adsorbent agents (feeding adsorbent agents daily in grain) could decrease enteric viral infections by binding with the viral pathogens in the gut and thus reducing the infectious dose. However, after completing the infectivity studies we lack support of this hypothesis. The infectivity data of the adsorbent material/virus complex (over virus alone) indicates that the complexes are not only infectious but many complexes are more infectious than the virus was originally. These results correspond with prior investigations which found that the persistence of reoviruses and enteroviruses is maintained and often enhanced when associated with clay and clay minerals (Schaub and Sagik, 1975; Lipson and Stotzky, 1984) . There is a potential error of titrating a solid in a liquid; however, the infectivity data is consistent and reproducible. The plaque assay is accepted as a more sensitive assay method (0.5\u00b11 log dilution) than the microtiter assay. The microtiter assay was used primarily in these studies because it is efficient and conserves time and cost over the plaque assay method. Results from the microtiter assay were confirmed by plaque assay using bovine rotavirus. It is our opinion that the adsorbent materials have enhanced the infectivity of the virus. One possibility to explain this observation is an improved presentation of virus to cells. A previous study (Bridger and Woode, 1976) indicates that there are two particle types of calf rotavirus: infectious and non-(or low) infectious particles. The complete rotavirus virion is composed of both inner and outer protein shells and is highly infectious as opposed to an incomplete virion which is missing its outer protein shell and is non-infectious. The outer protein shell is composed of viral proteins 7 and 4 (VP7 and VP4) which are responsible for the binding of virion to cell which is necessary for infection and thus replication. Bridger and Woode found that the ratios of particle number to infectivity were 7\u00c210 2 :1 for the complete virion vs. 1\u00c210 6 :1 for the incomplete virion. Our hypothesis for a more efficient presentation of virus is that an increased fraction of these incomplete particles are entering cells as a result of adsorbent materials being engulfed/phagocytosed and thus carrying virus into the cell with them. If this is the case, it may prove to be a method of culturing viruses that are difficult to propagate because they are comprised of a large proportion of incomplete virions. It is difficult of course to speculate what effect this will have in vivo but it is possible that diet may enhance infection. Future work includes separating complete and incomplete virions and repeating the infectivity studies, exploring both the reasons for infectivity of the complexed virus/adsorbent materials and the methods to significantly reduce the infectivity levels, and investigating the mechanisms of viral concentration within aqueous systems.",
