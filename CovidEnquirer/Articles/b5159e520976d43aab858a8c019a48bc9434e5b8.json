'In view of the significant proportion of plant extracts that have yielded positive results in these screenings, it seems reasonable to conclude that there are probably numerous types of antiviral compounds in these materials. Further characterization of the active ingredients of some of these plants should reveal some useful compounds' (Hudson, 1990) .

The collecting was carried out from May-July 1991, in five areas of the province: the Wyndel region in the Kootenay mountains, the Princeton-Penticton region in the interior, the Queen Charlotte Islands, the Fraser River canyon and the Lower Mainland. From the several hundred plant species on the ethnobotanical list, 100 specimens were collected. In order to ensure accurate botanical identilications, only plants which were in flower were collected, introducing a seasonal bias into the selection.

Six of these active extracts completely inhibited virus induced cytopathic effects at the non-cytotoxic concentrations tested. As has been found in previous antiviral screenings (see Hudson, 1990 for ovlerview), none of the extracts exhibited broad spect.rum activity. Each active extract was effective against only one of the seven viruses screened. Three of the most active extracts in this study were members of the same plant family.

It is possible that the elucidation of the active constituents in these plants may provide useful leads in the development of antiviral therapeutics. It is interesting to note that 10 of these 12 active plant species were traditionally used to treat what are now known as viral ailments. Eight of the active plants were used to treat the specific diseases caused by the virus that they exhibited activity against. The traditional medicinal uses, reported chemical constituents and pharmacological activities of the 12 plants which exhibited antiviral activity in this study are summarized below. Decoctions of the aerial parts of A. alnifolia were traditionally used to treat respiratory ailments such as colds and coughs, as well as diarrhea, influenza and smallpox. Serviceberry decoctions were also used as a general tonic, reportedly good for any type of sickness (Turner, 1'980; 1990) .",

Inner bark extract showed activity against respiratory syncytial virus. 0. horridus was a very important spiritual and physical medicine among the aboriginal peoples of western North America. The extensive traditional uses of Devil's Club were reviewed by Turner (1982) . The inner bark was used fresh, dried or ashed in a wide variety of preparations. For external applications, it was applied directly, as a salve or as a poultice for burns, swellings, sores, boils, swollen glands and sore areas. Poultices were also applied to wounds to prevent blood poisoning and to broken bones, toothaches and abrasions to relieve the pain and swelling.

One of the primary medicinal uses was in the treatment of respiratory ailments such as colds, coughs, chest pains, blood spitting and tuberculosis. Devils's Club was also used internally to treat a variety of diseases including: influenza, measles, diabetes, cancer, arthritis and rheumatism. It was often taken as a tonic or blood purifier for any general sickness and especially those with fever, weight loss and general debility. In higher doses, it was used as a purgative, emetic and cathartic (Turner, 1982 ). An inner bark infusion was also drunk for stomach troubles such as stomach pain, ulcers, gallstones, indigestion and constipation. It was commonly used to relieve internal pains caused by ailments as varied as broken bones to black eyes. Women drank a decoction to help expel the afterbirth, to start menstruation post partum and to treat uterine cancers (Turner, 1982) .

For diarrhea, vomiting, or women's illnesses, the branches were compounded with Prunus virginiana and Cornus sericea. The roots of Rosa species were boiled to make a decoction taken for syphilis and by women after childbirth (Turner, 1!)90). A bark decoction was used as an eyewash for cataracts or to enhance eyesight (Turner in Pojar and MacKinnon, 1994) . The Skagit people used a root decoction for sore throats and as an eye wash. Decoctions were also administered to ease labor pains and used as a wash to strengthen babies. The Quileuete and Quinault peoples used the ashes in a poultice for swellings and syphilitic sores (Gunther, 1973) .
