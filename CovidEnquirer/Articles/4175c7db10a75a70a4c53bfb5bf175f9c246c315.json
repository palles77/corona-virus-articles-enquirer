            "text": "Avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, is an epidemic caused by H5N1 virus that primarily affects birds like chickens, wild water birds, etc. On rare occasions, these can infect other species including pigs and humans. In the span of less than a year, the lethal strain of bird flu is spreading very fast across the globe mainly in South East Asia, parts of Central Asia, Africa and Europe. In order to study the patterns of spread of epidemic, we made an investigation of outbreaks of the epidemic in one week, that is from February 13-18, 2006, when the deadly virus surfaced in India. We have designed a statistical transmission model of bird flu taking into account the factors that affect the epidemic transmission such as source of infection, social and natural factors and various control measures are suggested. For modeling the general intensity coefficient f (r), we have implemented the recent ideas given in the article Fitting the Bill, Nature [R. Howlett, Fitting the bill, Nature 439 (2006) 402], which describes the geographical spread of epidemics due to transportation of poultry products. Our aim is to study the spread of avian influenza, both in time and space, to gain a better understanding of transmission mechanism. Our model yields satisfactory results as evidenced by the simulations and may be used for the prediction of future situations of epidemic for longer periods. We utilize real data at these various scales and our model allows one to generalize our predictions and make better suggestions for the control of this epidemic.",

Influenza virus has only one species in it, which is called influenza A virus. These influenza viruses occur naturally among birds. Wild birds worldwide carry these viruses in their intestine but usually do not get sick from them. However, avian influenza is very contagious among birds and can make some domesticated birds including chickens, ducks and turkeys very sick and kill them [20, 24, 30, 43] . Infected birds shed influenza viruses from their saliva, nasal secretions, etc. Susceptible birds become infected when they come in contact with the contaminated surfaces. Domesticated birds may become infected with avian influenza viruses through direct contact with infected waterfowl or other infected poultry [24, 28, 38] or through contact with surfaces (such as dirt or cages) or materials (such as water or food) that have been contaminated with the virus [1, 15, 39, 45, 49] .",

Influenza virus type A is the most significant epidemiologically and the most interesting from an ecological and evolutionary stand point, because it is found in a wide variety of bird and mammal species [9, 41] and can undergo major shifts in immunological properties. Type B is largely confined to humans and very little is known about type C. Type A virus is responsible for causing bird flu, which was first found in Italy in 1878. Type A virus is further divided into subtypes based on differences in membrane proteins HA and NA, which are the most important targets for the immune system. The notation HhNn is used to refer to the subtype comprising the hth discovered HA proteins and the nth discovered NA protein. The subtype H5N1 virus of type A virus is the main cause of the bird flu [12, 15, 23, 31, 42] . Subtype is further divided into strains; each genetically distinct virus isolated is usually considered to be a separate strain [11, 33] .",

Contaminated equipments, vehicles, food, cages and clothing like shoes can carry the viruses from farm to farm. Some evidence suggests that flies can also act as mechanical vectors [18] . Wet markets where live birds are sold under crowded and sometimes unsanitary conditions can be another source of spread. These constitute the main cause of the former transmission. Export and import of poultry products are the main cause of the latter transmission, since they can carry the viruses for long distances freely when artificial factors are prevented. Migratory birds can also be a cause of transmission between the countries [5, 27] . Efforts have been made on the study of avian influenza and most of the recent papers focus on topics such as the route of transmission, physiological and biological properties, etc. The bird flu virus of low pathogenicity can mutate into highly pathogenic one after a short time; the virus is sensitive to temperature change (it was found that the virus survives for shorter time at a higher temperature). This kind of influenza is able to transmit to humans under some circumstances (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs277/en/) [6, 7, 21, 44, 47, 52] ; however, no sufficient and clear evidences of human-to-human transmission have been found up to now [21] .",

On the second day bird flu hit four nations of Southeast Asia, Central Asia and Europe namely Indonesia, Iran, Austria and Germany.

Other social and natural factors also play an important role in the transmission of infection, for example, the control measures and the change in temperature. The source of infection that led to the outbreak is not clear. In some researcher's view migratory birds are thought to be carrying the virus [5, 27] . If migratory birds had brought the virus one would have expected outbreaks well before February as bird's migrations were over by around November. So we consider in our problem the source of outbreaks of bird flu to be the transportation of infected poultry as globalization has turned the chicken into the world's number one migratory bird species. We have assumed that it is mainly the human activities of commerce and trade that this epidemic has spread. For implementing this we have considered the concerns expressed by scientists from Max Plank Institute for Dynamics and Self Organization, Germany [19] . They have recognized the statistical characteristics of human travel independent of the means of transportation people use for the modeling of the spread of epidemics as published in the article [19] .",

Meanwhile (as many control measures have been taken into account in the formulation of the model) if the actual effect of these measures are assessed, then useful and effective control measures can be proposed for the prevention of the epidemic. From Figs. 3 and 4 , it is found that the probability of outbreak is inversely proportional to both the distance from the source country and the number of days at a fixed distance.",
