Aseptically scrub the clipped area with antimicrobial scrub solution. 3. Wearing gloves, insert a 22-or 20-gauge needle or over-the-needle catheter in four quadrants: cranial and to the right, cranial and to the left, caudal and to the right, and caudal and to the left of the umbilicus. As you insert the needle or catheter, gently twist the needle to push any abdominal organs away from the tip of the needle. Local anesthesia typically is not required for this procedure, although a light sedative or analgesic may be necessary if severe abdominal pain is present. In some cases, fluid will flow freely from one or more of the needles. If not, gently aspirate with a 3-to 6-mL syringe or aspirate with the patient in a standing position. Avoid changing positions with needles in place because iatrogenic puncture of intraabdominal organs may occur. 4. Save any fluid collected in sterile red-and lavender-topped tubes for cytologic and biochemical analyses and bacterial culture. Monitor hemorrhagic fluid carefully for the presence of clots. Normally, hemorrhagic effusions rapidly become defibrinated and do not clot. Clot formation can occur in the presence of ongoing active hemorrhage or may be due to the iatrogenic puncture of organs such as the spleen or liver. If abdominal paracentesis is negative, a diagnostic peritoneal lavage can be performed. Peritoneal dialysis kits are commercially available but are fairly expensive and often impractical.",

            "text": "Moist healing is a newer concept of wound management in which wound exudates are allowed to stay in contact with the wound. In the absence of infection a moist wound heals faster and has enzymatic activity as a result of macrophage and polymorphonuclear cell breakdown. Enzymatic degradation or \"autolytic debridement\" of the wound occurs. Moist wounds tend to promote neutrophil and macrophage chemotaxis and bacterial phagocytosis better than use of wet-to-dry bandages. A potential complication and disadvantage of moist healing, however, is the development of bacterial colonization, folliculitis, and trauma to wound edges that can occur because of the continuously moist environment. Use surfactant-type solutions (Constant Clens; Kendall, Mansfield, Massachusetts) for initial wound cleansing and debridement. Use occlusive dressings for rapid enzymatic debridement with bactericidal properties to aid in wound healing. Bandage wet necrotic wounds with a dressing premoistened with hypertonic saline (Curasalt [Kendall] , 20% saline) to clean and debride the wounds. Hypertonic saline functions to desiccate necrotic tissue and bacteria to debride the infected wound. Remove and replace the hypertonic saline bandage every 24 to 48 hours. Next, place gauze impregnated with antibacterial agents (Kerlix AMD [Kendall] ) over the wound in the bandage layer to act as a barrier to bacterial colonization.",

The nonadherent pad will not stick to the wound and cause patient discomfort. Because there usually is minimal drainage from the wound, the function of the intermediate layer is more protective than absorptive. Any small amount will be absorbed into the intermediate layer of the bandage. It is important in any bandage to place the tape strips or \"stirrups\" on the patient's limb and then overlap in the bandage, to prevent the bandage from slipping. Place the intermediate and tertiary layers loosely around the limb, starting distally and working proximally, with some overlap with each consecutive layer. This method prevents excessive pressure and potential to impair venous drainage. Leave the toenails of the third and fourth digits exposed, whenever possible, to allow daily examination of the bandage to determine whether the bandage is impairing venous drainage. If the bandage is too tight and constricting or impeding vascular flow, the toes will become swollen and spread apart.

To create a pressure bandage, place a nonadherent dressing immediately in contact with the wound, followed by a thick layer of absorbent material, topped by a layer of elastic bandage material such as Elastikon or Vetrap. Unlike the bandage for a closed wound, the top tertiary outer layer should be wrapped with some tension and even pressure around the limb, starting from the distal extremity (toes) and working proximally. The pressure bandage serves to control hemorrhage but should not be left on for long periods. Pressure bandages that have been left on for too long can impair nerve function and lead to tissue necrosis and slough. Therefore, pressure bandages should be used in the hospital only, so that the patient can be observed closely.

Use caution when placing pressure bandages around the thorax or cervical region because bandages placed too tightly may impair adequate ventilation. To place a pressure bandage and obliterate dead space, place a nonadherent contact layer over the wound. Usually, a drain is placed in the wound, so place a large amount of wide-mesh gauze at the distal end of the drain to absorb any wound exudate or drainage. Place several layers of absorbent material over the site to further absorb any drainage. Place a layer of elastic cotton such as Kling carefully but firmly over the dead space to cause enough pressure to control drainage.

Treatment of a transfusion reaction depends on its severity. In all cases, stop the transfusion immediately when clinical signs of a reaction occur. In most cases, discontinuation of the transfusion and administration of drugs to stop the hypersensitivity reaction will be sufficient. Once the medications have taken effect, restart the transfusion slowly and monitor the patient carefully for further signs of reaction. In more severe cases in which a patient's cardiovascular or respiratory system become compromised and hypotension, tachycardia, or tachypnea occurs, immediately discontinue the transfusion and administer diphenhydramine (1 mg/kg IM), dexamethasone-sodium phosphate (0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg IV), and epinephrine to the patient. The patient should have a urinary catheter and central venous catheter placed for measurement of urine output and central venous pressures.

In cats and small dogs, however, a long catheter placed in the lateral or medial saphenous vein can be used for trends in CVP monitoring. First, assemble the equipment necessary for jugular catheter (see Vascular Access Techniques for how to place a jugular or saphenous long catheter) and CVP monitoring (Box 1-7). After placing the jugular catheter, take a lateral thoracic radiograph to ensure that the tip of the catheter sits just outside of the right atrium for proper CVP measurements (see To establish an intravenous catheter for CVP, follow this procedure: 1. Assemble the CVP setup such that the male end of a length of sterile intravenous catheter extension tubing is inserted into the T port of the jugular or medial/lateral saphenous catheter. Make sure to flush the length of tubing with sterile saline before connecting it to the patient to avoid iatrogenic air embolism. 2. Next, insert the male end of a three-way stopcock into the female end of the extension tubing. 3. Attach a 20-mL syringe filled with heparinized sterile 0.9% saline to one of the female ports of the three-way stopcock and either a manometer or a second length of intravenous extension tubing attached to a metric ruler. 4. Lay the patient in lateral or sternal recumbancy. 5. Turn the stopcock OFF to the manometer/ruler and ON to the patient. Infuse a small amount of heparinized saline through the catheter to flush the catheter. 6. Next, turn the stopcock OFF to the patient and ON to the manometer. Gently flush the manometer or length of extension tubing with heparinized saline from the syringe. Use care not to agitate the fluid and create air bubbles within the line or manometer that will artifactually change the CVP measured. 7. Next, lower the 0 cm point on the manometer or ruler to the level of the patient's manubrium (if the patient is in lateral recumbancy) or the point of the elbow (if the patient is in sternal recumbancy). 8. Turn the stopcock OFF to the syringe, and allow the fluid column to equilibrate with the patient's intravascular volume. Once the fluid column stops falling and the level rises and falls with the patient's heartbeat, measure the number adjacent to the bottom of the meniscus of the fluid column. This is the CVP in centimeters of water (see Figure 1 -4). 9. Repeat the measurement several times with the patient in the same position to make sure that none of the values has been increased or decreased artifactually in error. Alternately, attach the central catheter to a pressure transducer and perform electronic monitoring of CVP. There is no absolute value for normal CVP. The normal CVP for small animal patients is 0 to 5 cm H 2 O. Values less than zero are associated with absolute or relative hypovolemia. Values of 5 to 10 cm H 2 O are borderline hypervolemia, and values greater than 10 cm H 2 O suggest intravascular volume overload. Values greater than 15 cm H 2 O may be correlated with congestive heart failure and the development of pulmonary edema. In individual patients, the trend in change in CVP is more important than absolute values. As a rule of thumb, when using CVP measurements to gauge fluid therapy and avoid vascular and pulmonary overload, the CVP should not increase by more than 5 cm H 2 O in any 24-hour period. If an abrupt increase in CVP is found, repeat the measurement to make sure that the elevated value was not obtained in error. If the value truly has increased dramatically, temporarily discontinue fluid therapy and consider administration of a diuretic.",

Ideally, obtain an arterial blood sample so that you can monitor the patient's oxygenation and ventilation. Once an arterial blood sample has been obtained, follow these steps: 1. Determine whether the blood sample is arterial or venous by looking at the oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ). The SaO 2 should be greater than 90% if the sample is truly arterial, although it can be as low as 80% if a patient has severe hypoxemia. 2. Consider the patient's pH. If the pH is outside of the normal range, an acid-base disturbance is present. If the pH is within the normal range, an acid-base disturbance may or may not be present. If the pH is low, the patient is acidotic. If the pH is high, the patient is alkalotic. 3. Next, look at the base excess or deficit. If the base excess is increased, the patient has higher than normal bicarbonate. If there is a base deficit, the patient may have a low bicarbonate or increase in unmeasured anions (e.g., lactic acid or ketoacids). 4. Next, look at the bicarbonate. If the pH is low AND the bicarbonate is low, the patient has a metabolic acidosis. If the pH is high AND the bicarbonate is elevated, the patient has a metabolic alkalosis. 5. Next, look at the PaCO 2 . If the patient's pH is low and the PaCO 2 is elevated, the patient has a respiratory acidosis. If the patient's pH is high and the PaCO 2 is low, the patient has a respiratory alkalosis. 6. Finally, if you are interested in the patient's oxygenation, look at the PaO 2 . Normal PaO 2 is greater than 80 mm Hg. The metabolic acidosis early in renal failure may be hyperchloremic and later may convert to typical increased anion gap acidosis.",

For example, is the patient retaining bicarbonate (metabolic alkalosis) because of carbon dioxide retention (respiratory acidosis)? Use the chart in Table 1 -6 to evaluate whether the appropriate degree of compensation is occurring. If the adaptive response falls within the expected range, a simple acid-base disorder is present. If the response falls outside of the expected range, a mixed acid-base disorder is likely present. 8. Finally, you must determine whether the patient's acid-base disturbance is compatible with the history and physical examination findings. If the acid-base disturbance does not fit with the patient's history and physical examination abnormalities, question the results of the blood gas analyses and possibly repeat them. The most desirable method of assessing the acid-base status of an animal is with a blood gas analyzer. Arterial samples are preferred over venous samples, with heparin used as an anticoagulant (Table 1-7) .",

Changes in serum potassium can affect cardiac conduction adversely. Hyperkalemia lowers the resting membrane potential and makes cardiac cells, particularly those of the atria, more susceptible to depolarization. Characteristic signs of severe hyperkalemia that can be observed on an ECG rhythm strip include an absence of P waves, widened QRS complexes, and tall tented or spiked T waves. Further increases in serum potassium can be associated with bradycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and cardiac asystole (death). Treatment of hyperkalemia consists of administration of insulin (0.25 to 0.5 units/kg, IV regular insulin) and dextrose (1 g dextrose per unit of insulin administered, followed by 2.5% dextrose IV CRI to prevent hypoglycemia), calcium (2 to 10 mL of 10% calcium gluconate administered IV slowly to effect), or sodium bicarbonate (1 mEq/kg, IV slowly). Insulin plus dextrose and bicarbonate therapy help drive the potassium intracellularly, whereas calcium antagonizes the effect of hyperkalemia on the myocardial cells. All of the treatments work within minutes, although the effects are relatively short-lived (20 minutes to 1 hour) unless the cause of the hyperkalemia is identified and treated appropriately (Box 1-10). Dilution of serum potassium also results from restoring intravascular fluid volume and correcting metabolic acidosis, in most cases. Treatment with a fluid that does not contain potassium (preferably 0.9% sodium chloride) is recommended.",

An increased serum sodium concentration implies hyperosmolality, whereas a decrease in serum sodium concentration usually, but not always, implies hypoosmolality. The severity of clinical signs of hypernatremia and hyponatremia is related primarily to the rapidity of the onset of the change rather than to the magnitude of the associated plasma hyperosmolality or hypoosmolality. Clinical signs of neurologic disturbances include disorientation, ataxia, and seizures, and coma may occur at serum sodium concentrations less than 120 mEq/L or greater than 170 mEq/L in dogs. Therapy of hypernatremia or hyponatremia with fluid containing low or higher concentrations of sodium should proceed with caution, for rapid changes (decreases or increases) of serum sodium and osmolality can cause rapid changes in the intracellular and extracellular fluid flux, leading to intracellular dehydration or edema, even though the serum sodium has not been returned to normal.

The major player in maintaining intravascular and interstitial oncotic pressure, the water-retaining property of each fluid compartment, is albumin. Albumin contributes roughly 80% to the colloidal oncotic pressure of blood. The majority of albumin is located within the interstitial space. Hypoalbuminemia can result from increased loss in the form of protein-losing enteropathy or nephropathy and wound exudates, or it may be due to lack of hepatic albumin synthesis. Serum albumin pools are in a constant flux with interstitial albumin. Once interstitial albumin pools become depleted from replenishing serum albumin, serum albumin levels can continue to decrease, which can lead to a decrease in colloidal oncotic pressure. Serum albumin less than 2.0 g/dL has been associated with inadequate intravascular fluid retention and the development of peripheral edema and third spacing of fluid. Oncotic pressure can be restored with the use of artificial or synthetic colloids or natural colloids (see Colloids).",

Alternately, a pediatric (infant) incubator can be purchased from hospital supply sources, and humidified oxygen can be run into the cage at 2 to 10 L/minute (depending on the size of the cage). High flow rates may be required to eliminate nitrogen and carbon dioxide from the cage. In most cases, the FIO 2 inside the cage reaches 40% to 50% using this technique. Disadvantages of using an oxygen cage are high consumption/ use of oxygen, rapid decrease in the FIO 2 within the cage whenever the cage must be opened for patient treatments, lack of immediate access to the patient, and potential for iatrogenic hyperthermia.",

To place a nasal or nasopharyngeal catheter, obtain a red rubber catheter (8F to 12F, depending on the size of the patient). a. For nasal oxygen supplementation, measure the distal tip of the catheter from the medial canthus of the eye to the tip of the nose. b. For nasopharyngeal oxygen supplementation, measure the catheter from the ramus of the mandible to the tip of the nose. 2. Mark the tube length at the tip of the nose with a permanent marker. 3. Instill topical anesthetic such as proparacaine (0.5%) or lidocaine (2%) into the nostril before placement. 4. Place a stay suture adjacent to (lateral aspect) the nostril while the topical anesthetic is taking effect. 5. Lubricate the tip of the tube with sterile lubricant. 6. Gently insert the tube into the ventral medial aspect of the nostril to the level made with the permanent marker. If you are inserting the tube into the nasopharynx, push the nasal meatus dorsally while simultaneously pushing the lateral aspect of the nostril medially to direct the tube into the ventral nasal meatus and avoid the cribriform plate. 7. Once the tube has been inserted to the appropriate length, hold the tube in place with your fingers adjacent to the nostril, and suture the tube to the stay suture. If the tube is removed, you can cut the suture around the tube and leave the stay suture in place for later use, if necessary. 8. Suture or staple the rest of the tube dorsally over the nose and in between the eyes to the top of the head, or laterally along the zygomatic arch. 9. Attach the tube to a length of flexible oxygen tubing, and provide humidified oxygen at 50 to 100 mL/kg/minute. 10. Secure an Elizabethan collar around the patient's head to prevent the patient from scratching at the tube and removing it.",

Normally, at the onset of exhalation, the gas exhaled into the expiratory limb of the tubing comes from the upper airway or physiologic dead space and contains relatively little carbon dioxide. As exhalation continues, a steep uphill slope occurs as more carbon dioxide is exhaled from the bronchial tree. Near the end of exhalation, the capnogram reaches a plateau, which most accurately reflects the carbon dioxide level at the level of the alveolus. Because carbon dioxide diffuses across the alveolar basement membrane so rapidly, this reflects arterial carbon dioxide levels. If a plateau is not reached and notching of the waveform occurs, check the system for leaks. If the baseline waveform does not reach zero, the patient may be rebreathing carbon dioxide or may be tachypneic, causing physiologic positive end-expiratory pressure. The soda-sorb in the system should be replaced if it has expired. Conversely, low end-tidal carbon dioxide may be associated with a decrease in perfusion or blood flow. Decreased perfusion can be associated with low end-tidal carbon dioxide values, particularly during cardiopulmonary cerebral resuscitation. End-tidal carbon dioxide levels are one of the most accurate predictors of the efficacy of cardiopulmonary cerebral resuscitation and patient outcome. Additionally, the difference between arterial carbon dioxide levels (PaCO 2 ) and end-tidal carbon dioxide can be used to calculate dead-space ventilation. Increases in the difference also occur with poor lung perfusion and pulmonary diffusion impairment. ",

In a patient with an oral mass that is drooling excessively or a patient that is vomiting, peripheral cephalic catheterization may not be the most appropriate, to prevent contamination. Conversely, in a patient with excessive urination or diarrhea, a lateral or medial saphenous catheter is likely to become contaminated quickly.",

If the needle is plugged with bone debris, remove the needle and replace it with a fresh needle of the same type and size in the hole that you have created. A spinal needle with an internal stylette also can be placed. The stylette will prevent the needle from becoming clogged with bone debris during insertion. Secure the hub of the needle with a butterfly length of white adhesive tape and then suture it to the skin to keep the catheter in place. The catheter is now ready for use. The patient should wear an Elizabethan collar to prevent disruption or removal of the catheter. The intraosseous catheter can be maintained as any peripheral catheter, with frequent flushing and daily evaluation of the catheter site. ",

Both types of pain can be classified further based on site of origin. Somatic pain arises from superficial skin, subcutaneous tissue, body wall, or appendages. Visceral pain arises from abdominal or thoracic viscera and primarily is associated with serosal irritation. Analgesia, then, is the loss of pain WITHOUT the loss of consciousness.

The drugs from this class constitute the most effective means of controlling acute, perioperative, and chronic pain in human and veterinary medicine (Table 1 -16) . Their physiologic effects result from the interaction with one or more of at least five endogenous opioid receptors (\u00b5, \u03c3, \u03b4, \u03b5, and \u03ba). \u00b5-Receptor agonists are noted for their ability to produce profound analgesia with mild sedation. These drugs diminish \"wind-up,\" the hyperexcitable state resulting from an afferent volley of nociceptive impulses. They elevate the pain threshold and are used preemptively to prevent acute pain. As a class, opioids cause CNS depression with their intense analgesia. Dose-related respiratory depression reflects diminished response to carbon dioxide levels. Cardiac depression is secondary only to bradycardia and is more likely with certain opioids such as morphine and oxymorphone. Narcotics produce few if any clinically significant cardiovascular effects in dogs and cats; they are considered cardiac soothing or sparing. Because opioids increase intracranial and intraocular pressure, use them more cautiously in patients with severe cranial trauma and or ocular lesions. Opioids directly stimulate the chemoreceptor trigger zone and may cause nausea and vomiting. Most opioids depress the cough reflex via a central mechanism; this may be helpful in patients recovering from endotracheal intubation irritation. A key characteristic of opioids that makes them desirable for use in emergency and critical care situations is their reversibility. Antagonists block or reverse the effect of agonists by combining with receptors and producing minimal or no effects. Administer all reversal agents, such as naloxone and naltrexone, slowly if given intravenously and to effect. \u03b1 \u03b1 2 -AGONISTS As a class of drugs, \u03b1 2 -agonists warrant special attention because most members of the group possess potent analgesic power at doses that are capable of causing sedation, CNS depression, cardiovascular depression, and even general anesthetic states. Originally developed for antihypertensive use, \u03b1 2 -agonists quickly have attained sedative analgesic status in veterinary medicine (Table 1 -17) . Like the opioids, \u03b1 2 -agonists produce their effects by aggravating \u03b1-adrenergic receptors in the CNS and periphery.",

Most of the currently available oral and parenteral NSAIDS for small animal medicine and surgery target the cyclooxygenase pathways predominantly, although one (tepoxalin) is thought to inhibit both pathways. Inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 can inhibit the protective effects and impair platelet aggregation and lead to gastrointestinal ulceration. There are definite contraindications and relative contraindications for the use of NSAIDs. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs should not be administered to patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency, dehydration, hypotension or conditions that are associated with low circulating volume (congestive heart failure, unregulated anesthesia, shock), or evidence of ulcerative gastrointestinal disease. TRAUMA PATIENTS should be stabilized completely regarding vascular volume, tone, and pressure before the use of NSAIDs. Patients receiving concurrent administration of other NSAIDs or corticosteroids, or those considered to be cushingoid, should be evaluated carefully for an adequate \"washout\" period (time of clearance of drug from the system) before use of an NSAID or before switching NSAIDs. Patients with coagulopathies, particularly those that are caused by platelet number or function defects or those caused by factor deficiencies, and patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma or other bronchial disease are probably not the patients in which to use NSAIDs. Other advice is that NSAIDs not be administered to pregnant patients or to females attempting to become pregnant because COX-2 induction is necessary for ovulation and subsequent implantation of the embryo.

Cats are susceptible because of slow clearance and dose-dependent elimination because of deficient glucuronidation in this species. Because of this, the dose and the dosing interval of most commonly used NSAIDs need to be altered in order for these drugs to be used. Cats that have been given canine doses of NSAIDs (twice daily or even once daily repetitively) may show hyperthermia, hemorrhagic or ulcerative gastritis, kidney and liver injury, hyperthermia, respiratory alkalosis, and metabolic acidosis. Acute and chronic toxicities of NSAIDs have been reported in cats, especially after repeat once daily dosing. Ketoprofen, flunixin, aspirin, carprofen, and meloxicam have been administered safely to cats, although like most antibiotics and other medications, they are not approved and licensed for use in cats. An important note, though, is that dosing intervals ranging from 48 to 96 hours have been used, and antithrombotic effects often can be achieved at much lower doses than those required to treat fevers and inflammation. I recommend the use of no loading doses, minimum 48-hour dosing intervals, and assurance of adequate circulating blood volume, blood pressure, and renal function. Because many of the NSAIDs are used off-label in cats, it is imperative that the clinician carefully calculate the dose, modify the dosing interval, and communicate this information to the client before dispensing the drug. Even drugs that come in liquid form (meloxicam), if administered to cats via box-labeled directions used for dogs, will be given in near toxic doses. To worsen the misunderstanding about dosages for cats, drops from manufacturer's bottles often are calibrated drops; when these same liquids are transferred into pharmacy syringes for drop administration, the calibration of course is lost, and the animal potentially is overdosed. A more accurate method of dispensing and administering oral NSAIDs in cats is to calculate the dose in milligrams and determine the exact number of milliliters to administer, rather than use the drop method.",

Gabapentin does this through calcium channel modulation without binding to glutamate receptors. Chronic, burning, neuropathic, and lancinating pain in small animals responds well to 1 to 10 mg/kg PO daily.",

Local anesthetics also may be administered epidurally, intrathoracically, intraperitoneally, and intraarticularly. Lidocaine and bupivacaine are the most commonly administered local anesthetics. Lidocaine provides for quick, short-acting sensory and motor impairment. Bupivacaine provides for later-onset, longerlasting desensitization without motor impairment. Combinations of the two agents diluted with saline are used frequently to provide for quick-onset analgesia that lasts between 4 and 6 hours in most patients. Adding narcotic and/or \u03b1 2 agent often maximizes the analgesia and increases the pain-free interval to 8 to 18 hours. Epinephrine and preservative-free solutions are recommended. Precision placement of anesthetic close to nerves, roots, or plexuses is improved with the use of a stimulating nerve locator. Cats seem to be more sensitive to the effects of local anesthetics; as such the lower ends of most dosing ranges are used for blockades in this species. Unlike most instances of general anesthesia, during which the animal is rendered unconscious and nerve transmission is decreased by virtue of CNS depression, local and regional techniques block the initiation of noxious signals, thereby effectively preventing pain from entering the CNS. This is an effective means of not only preventing initial pain but also reducing the changes that take place in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, spinothalamic tracts, limbic and reticular activating centers, and cortex. Frequently, the neurohormonal response that is stimulated in pain and stress is blunted as well. Overall, the patient has fewer local and systemic adverse effects of pain, disease processes are minimized, chronic pain states are unlikely, and outcome is improved. Regional techniques are best used as part of an analgesic regimen that consists of their continuous administration, narcotics, \u03b1-agonists, anxiolytics, and good nursing.",

Epidural analgesia and anesthesia are used for a variety of acute and chronic surgical pain or traumatically induced pain in the pelvis, tail, perineum, hind limbs, abdomen, and thorax (Table 1 -21) . Procedures in which epidural analgesia and anesthesia are useful include forelimb and hind limb amputation, tail or perineal procedures, cesarean sections, diaphragmatic hernia repair, pancreatitis, peritonitis, and intervertebral disk disease. Epidural blocks performed using opioids or bupivacaine will not result in hind limb paresis or decreased urinary or anal tone (incontinence), unlike lidocaine or mepivicaine epidural blocks. Morphine is one of the most useful opioids for administration in the epidural space because of its slow systemic absorption. Epidural catheters used for the instillation of drugs through constant rate infusion or intermittent injection can be placed in dogs and cats. Routinely placed at the lumbosacral junction, these catheters are used with cocktails including preservative-free morphine, bupivacaine, medetomidine, and ketamine.

Briefly observe the patient from a distance. Are there any abnormal postures? Is there respiratory distress? Is the animal ambulatory, and if so, do you observe any gait abnormalities? Do you observe any ptyalism or attempts to vomit? Auscultate the patient's thorax for crackles that may signify aspiration pneumonia resulting from vomiting. Examine the patient's mucous membrane color and capillary refill time, heart rate, heart rhythm, and pulse quality. Many patients in pain have tachycardia that may or may not be accompanied by dysrhythmias. If a patient's heart rate is inappropriately bradycardic, consider hypoadrenocorticism, whipworm infestation, or urinary obstruction or trauma as a cause of hyperkalemia. Assess the patient's hydration status by evaluating skin turgor, mucous membrane dryness, and whether the eyes appear sunken in their orbits. A brief neurologic examination should consist of whether the patient is actively having a seizure, or whether mental dullness, stupor, coma, or nystagmus are present.

Address specific problems such as gastric or splenic torsion, enteroplication, and foreign body removal, and then copiously lavage the abdomen with warmed sterile saline solution. Suction the saline solution thoroughly from the peritoneal cavity so as to not impair macrophage function. In cases of septic peritonitis, the abdomen may be left open, or a drain may be placed for further suction and lavage. The routine use of antibiotics in irrigation solutions is contraindicated because the antibiotics can irritate the peritoneum and delay healing. When the abdominal cavity is left open, secure sterile laparotomy towels and water-impermeable dressings over the abdominal wound with umbilical tape, and then change these daily or as strike-through occurs. Open abdomen cases are often effusive and require meticulous evaluation and management of electrolyte imbalances and hypoalbuminemia. The abdomen can be closed and/or the abdominal drain removed when the volume of the effusion decreases, when bacteria are no longer present, and when the neutrophils become more healthy in appearance.",

Early in DIC the procoagulant cascade dominates, with hypercoagulability. Activated clotting time, APTT, and PT may be rapid and shorter than normal. In most cases, we do not recognize the hypercoagulable state in our critically ill patients. Later in DIC, as platelets and activated clotting factors become consumed, the ACT, APTT, and PT become prolonged. Antithrombin, a natural anticoagulant, also becomes consumed, and antithrombin levels decline. Antithrombin levels can be measured at commercial laboratories and in some large veterinary institutions. The end products of thrombosis and subsequent fibrinolysis also can be measured. Fibrinogen levels may decline, although this test is not sensitive or specific for DIC. Fibrin degradation (split) products also become elevated. Fibrin degradation products are normally cleared by the liver, and these also become elevated in cases of hepatic failure because of lack of clearance.

A number of variants of the disease have been described: Von Willebrand's disease type I is associated with a defect in factor VIIR/protein concentration, and von Willebrand's disease type II is associated with a defect in VIIIR:vWF. Type I von Willebrand's disease is most common in veterinary medicine. Von Willebrand's disease has been identified in more than 29 breeds of dogs, with an incidence that varies from 10% to 60% depending on the breed of origin. Affected breeds include Doberman Pinchers, German Shepherd Dogs, Scottish Terriers and standard Manchester Terriers, Golden Retrievers, Chesapeake Bay Retrievers, Miniature Schnauzers, and Pembroke Welsh Corgis. Two forms of genetic expression occur: (1) autosomal recessive disease in which homozygous von Willebrand's disease individuals have a bleeding disorder, whereas heterozygous individuals carry the trait but are clinically normal. The second variant of genetic expression involves an autosomal dominant disease with incomplete expression such that heterozygous individuals are affected carriers and homozygous individuals are severely affected. Von Willebrand's disease has high morbidity, but fortunately a low mortality. Dogs with 30% or less than normal vWF tend to hemorrhage. Platelet counts are normal, but bleeding times can be prolonged. The APTT can be slightly prolonged when factor VIII is less than 50% of normal. Routine screening tests are nondiagnostic for this disease, although in a predisposed breed with a normal platelet count, a prolonged buccal mucosa bleeding time strongly supports a diagnosis of von Willebrand's disease. Documentation of clinical bleeding with low or undetectable levels of factor VIII antigen or platelet-related activities of vWF support a diagnosis of von Willebrand's disease. Recessive animals have zero vWF:antigen (a subunit of factor III); heterozygotes have 15% to 60% of normal. In the incompletely dominant form, levels of vWF antigen are reduced (less than 7% to 60%). Clinical signs in affected animals include epistaxis, hematuria, diarrhea with melena, penile bleeding, lameness, hemarthrosis, hematoma formation, and excessive bleeding with routine procedures such as nail trimming, ear cropping, tail docking, surgical procedures (spay, neuter), and lacerations. Estrous and postpartum bleeding may be prolonged. A DNA test to detect carriers of the vWF gene is available through VetGen (Ann Arbor, Michigan) and Michigan State University. Patients with von Willebrand's disease should avoid drugs known to affect platelet function adversely (sulfonamide, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, antihistamines, theophylline, phenothiazine tranquilizers, heparin, and estrogen).",

A fresh whole blood transfusion can be obtained from the donor and immediately administered to the patient, or spun down and the fresh plasma administered if RBCs are not needed. Administer a dose of DDAVP to any affected dog before initiating any elective surgical procedures. A supply of fresh frozen plasma and RBCs should be on hand, should uncontrolled hemorrhage occur.",

Causes of accelerated platelet destruction are typically immune-mediated autoantibodies, drug antibodies, infection, and isoimmune destruction. Consumption and sequestration usually are caused by DIC, vasculitis, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, severe vascular injury, hemolytic uremic syndrome, and gram-negative septicemia. Primary thrombocytopenia with no known cause has been called idiopathic thrombocytic purpura. In approximately 80% of the cases, thrombocytopenia is associated with immune-mediated destruction caused by immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, DIC, and diseases that affect the bone marrow. In systemic lupus erythematosus, 20% to 30% of the affected dogs have concurrent idiopathic thrombocytic purpura. When immune-mediated hemolytic anemia and idiopathic thrombocytic purpura are present in the same patient, the disease is called Evans syndrome. PF-3 is a non-complement-fixing antibody that is produced in the spleen and affects peripheral and bone marrow platelets and megakaryocytes. Antibodies directed against platelets are usually of the IgG subtype in animals. Antiplatelet antibodies can be measured by a PF-3 release test. Platelet counts with immune-mediated destruction typically are less than 50,000 platelets/\u00b5L. Infectious causes of thrombocytopenia include Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum (formerly, Ehrlichia equi), and Rickettsia rickettsii (Rocky Mountain spotted fever). Primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia has an unknown cause and most frequently is seen in middle-to older-aged female dogs. Breed predispositions include Cocker Spaniels, German Shepherd Dogs, Poodles (toy, miniature, standard), and Old English Sheepdogs. Thrombocytopenia usually is manifested as petechiae, ecchymoses of skin and mucous membranes, hyphema, gingival and conjunctival bleeding, hematuria, melena, and epistaxis. To make a diagnosis of idiopathic thrombocytic purpura, measure the severity of thrombocytopenia (< 50,000 platelets/\u00b5L), analyze the peripheral blood smear for evidence of platelet fragmentation or microthrombocytosis, normal to increased numbers of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow, detection of antiplatelet antibody, increased platelet counts after starting glucocorticoid therapy, and elimination of other causes of thrombocytopenia. If tick-borne illnesses are suspected, antibody titers for E. canis, A. phagocytophilum (formerly E. equi), and R. rickettsii should be performed.",

Traditionally, the gold standard to suppress the immune system is to use glucocorticoids (prednisone or prednisolone, 2 to 4 mg/kg PO bid divided, OR dexamethasone, 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg IV or PO q12h). More recently human serum immunoglobulin (IgG) also has been used (0.2 to 0.5 g/kg IV in saline over 8 hours; pretreat with 1 mg/kg diphenhydramine 15 minutes before starting infusion). Vincristine (0.5 mg/m 2 IV once) can stimulate the release of platelets from the bone marrow if megakaryocytic precursors are present; however, the platelets released may be immature and potentially nonfunctional. Treatment with fresh whole blood or packed RBCs is appropriate if anemia is present; however, unless specific platelet-rich plasma has been purchased from a blood bank, fresh whole blood contains relatively few platelets, which are shortlived (2 hours) and will not effectively raise the platelet count at all. Finally, long-term therapy is usually in the form of azathioprine (2 mg/kg PO once daily, tapered to 1 mg/kg daily to every other day after 1 week) and cyclosporine (10 to 25 mg/kg PO divided).

Perform the ABCs or CABs of CPCR, where A is airway, B is breathing, and C is compression and circulation. Recently, the paradigm has shifted to CABs. While a team member is grabbing an endotracheal tube, clearing the airway of foreign debris, and establishing airway access through endotracheal intubation, a second person starts external cardiac compressions to deliver oxygen that is in the bloodstream to the vital organs. The patient should be positioned in dorsal (> 7 kg) or lateral (< 7 kg) recumbency for external cardiac compressions. Approximately 80 to 120 external compressions should be performed over the patient's sternum. A team member should palpate for a peripheral pulse to determine whether cardiac compressions are actually effective. If a peripheral pulse cannot be palpated for every chest compression, change the patient's position and have a larger individual perform compressions, or initiate open-chest cardiac resuscitation. Once the patient is intubated, tie in the endotracheal tube and attach it to an oxygen source (anesthetic machine or mechanical ventilator or Ambu bag) for artificial ventilation. The oxygen flow rate should be 150 mL/kg/minute. Give two long breaths, and then 12 to 16 breaths per minute. Simultaneous ventilation with thoracic compression increases the pressure difference in the thorax and allows more forward flow of oxygenated blood through the great vessels into the periphery. If possible, a third team member can initiate interposed abdominal compressions, compressing the abdomen when the thoracic cage is relaxed, to improve forward flow. If only one person is available to perform the thoracic compressions and ventilation, give two breaths for every 15 compressions (i.e., 15 thoracic compressions followed by two long breaths, and then start thoracic compressions again). The Jen Chung maneuver can be performed by placing a 25-to 22-gauge hypodermic needle through the skin of the nasal philtrum and twisting the needle into the periosteum to stimulate respirations. This maneuver appears to work better in cats than dogs at return to spontaneous respiration.",

One of the most important things to do when the ECG looks like asystole is to make sure that the ECG monitor is working properly and that all ECG leads are attached properly to the patient. If asystole is truly present, reverse any opiate, \u03b1 2 -agonist, or benzodiazepine drugs with their appropriate reversal agents. Lowdose epinephrine (0.02 to 0.04 mg/kg diluted with 5 mL sterile saline) can be administered directly into the endotracheal tube via a rigid or red rubber catheter. If vascular access is available, epinephrine (0.02 to 0.04 mg/kg) can be administered intravenously. No drug should ever be administered directly into the heart by intracardiac injection. Unless the heart is in the veterinarian's hand during open-chest CPCR, intracardiac injection is risky and potentially could lacerate a coronary artery or cause the myocardium to become more irritable and refractory to other therapies, if a drug is delivered into the myocardium and not into the ventricle. For these reasons, intracardiac injections are contraindicated. Administer atropine (0.4 mg/kg IV, IO, or 0.4 mg/kg IT) immediately after the epinephrine. Atropine, a vagolytic drug, serves to decrease tonic vagal inhibition of the sinoatrial and atrioventricular node and increase heart rate. Administer atropine and epinephrine every 2 to 5 minutes during asystole while cardiac compressions, interposed abdominal compressions, and artificial ventilation are continued. Although discontinuation of thoracic compressions can decrease the chance of success during CPCR, you must intermittently evaluate the ECG monitor for any rhythm change that may require different drug therapies. If the cardiac arrest was not witnessed or more than 2 to 5 minutes have passed without successful return to a perfusing rhythm, perform open-chest CPCR, if the client wishes. Administer sodium bicarbonate (1 to 2 mEq/kg IV) every 10 to 15 minutes during CPCR.

Occasionally, supraventricular dysrhythmias may be associated with respiratory or other systemic illness. Sustained supraventricular tachycardia in the absence of underlying structural heart or systemic disease is disturbing and should alert the clinician that an accessory pathway conduction disturbance may be present, particularly in Labrador Retrievers. Supraventricular dysrhythmias can manifest as isolated premature complexes (atrial premature complexes or contractions), sustained or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (atrial tachycardia), or atrial fibrillation or flutter. In the dog, atrial fibrillation most commonly is associated with dilative cardiomyopathy. Rarely and primarily in giant breed dogs, lone atrial fibrillation can occur with no underlying heart disease. Atrial fibrillation and the resultant sustained elevation in ventricular rate are presumed to progress to dilative cardiomyopathy in such breeds. By comparison, atrial fibrillation is relatively uncommon in cats because of the small size of their atria but is associated most commonly with hypertrophic and restrictive cardiomyopathy.",

Treat these ventricular dysrhythmias immediately and aggressively. In dogs, the mainstay of emergency treatment for ventricular dysrhythmias is lidocaine therapy.

            "text": "Pericardial effusion often develops as a consequence of neoplasia in the older dog and cat. The most common types of neoplasia that affect the heart and pericardium include hemangiosarcoma, chemodectoma, mesothelioma, and metastatic neoplasia. More rarely, other causes of pericardial effusion include benign idiopathic pericardial effusion, coagulopathy, left atrial rupture in dogs with chronic mitral valvular insufficiency, infection, or pericardial cysts. Regardless of the cause of the effusion, the development of pericardial tamponade adversely affects cardiac output. Cardiac output is a function of heart rate and stroke volume. Stroke volume depends on cardiac preload. The presence of pericardial effusion can impede venous return to the heart and thus adversely affect preload. In addition, as preload decreases, heart rate reflexively increases in an attempt to maintain normal cardiac output. As heart rate increases more than 160 beats/minute, diastolic filling is impaired further, and cardiac output further declines. Animals with pericardial effusion often demonstrate the classic signs of hypovolemic or cardiogenic shock: anorexia, weakness, lethargy, cyanosis, cool peripheral extremities, tachycardia, weak thready pulses, hypotension, and collapse. Physical examination abnormalities may include muffled heart sounds, thready femoral pulses, pulsus paradoxus, jugular venous distention, weakness, tachycardia, cyanosis, and tachypnea. Electrocardiogram findings may include low amplitude QRS complexes (<0.5 mV), sinus tachycardia, ventricular dysrhythmias, or electrical alternans (Figure 1-39) . Thoracic radiographs often demonstrate a globoid cardiac silhouette, although the cardiac silhouette rarely may appear normal with concurrent clinical signs of cardiogenic shock in cases of acute hemorrhage. In such cases the removal of even small amounts of pericardial effusion by pericardiocentesis can increase cardiac output exponentially and alleviate clinical signs (Table 1-35) . Unless an animal is dying before your eyes, ideally perform an echocardiogram to attempt to determine whether a right atrial, right auricular, or heart base mass is present before pericardiocentesis.",

Wearing sterile gloves, make a small nick incision in the skin to decrease drag on the needle and catheter during insertion. 7. Slowly insert the needle and catheter, watching for a flash of blood in the hub of the needle, and simultaneously watching for cardiac dysrhythmias on the ECG monitor. 8. Once a flash of blood is observed in the hub of the needle, advance the catheter off of the stylette further into the pericardial sac, and remove the stylette. 9. Attach the length of intravenous extension tubing to the catheter, and have an assistant withdraw the fluid slowly. 10. Place a small amount of fluid in a red-topped tube, and watch for clots. Clot formation could signify that you have penetrated the right ventricle inadvertently or that active hemorrhage is occurring.

Treatment for urethral prolapse should occur at the time of diagnosis to prevent selfinduced trauma and infection. Immediate therapy includes manual reduction of the prolapsed tissue and placement of a purse-string suture around an indwelling urinary catheter. The purse-string suture can remain in place for up to 5 days until definitive repair. Until the time of surgery, place an Elizabethan collar on the patient to prevent self-mutilation. Several forms of surgical correction have been described. In some cases, surgical resection of the prolapsed tissue with apposition of the urethral and penile mucosa can be attempted. More recently, a technique involving placement of several mattress sutures to reduce and secure the prolapsed tissue has been described. Recurrence of prolapse can occur with either technique, particularly if the inciting event recurs.

Hyperthermia is defined as a rectal temperature of 41\u00b0to 43\u00b0C (105\u00b0to 110\u00b0F). Clinical signs of hyperthermia include congested hyperemic mucous membranes, tachycardia, and panting.

Cardiac dysrhythmias, interstitial and intracellular dehydration, intravascular hypovolemia, central nervous dysfunction, slough of gastrointestinal mucosa, oliguria, and coagulopathies can be seen as organ function declines. Excessive panting can result in respiratory alkalosis. Poor tissue perfusion results in a metabolic acidosis. Loss of water in excess of solutes such as sodium and chloride can lead to a free water deficit and severe hypernatremia. A marked increase in PCV occurs because of the free water loss.

The male is unable to penetrate the skin because of its small size. Black widow spiders are found throughout the United States and Canada. Black widow spider venom is neurotoxic and acts presynaptically, releasing large amounts of acetylcholine and norepinephrine. There appears to be a seasonal variation in the potency of the venom, lowest in the spring and highest in the fall. In dogs, envenomation results in hyperesthesia, muscle fasciculations, and hypertension. Muscle rigidity without tenderness is characteristic. Affected animals may demonstrate clinical signs of acute abdominal pain. Tonic-clonic convulsions may occur but are rare. In cats, paralytic signs predominate and appear early as a ascending lower motor neuron paralysis. Increased salivation, vomiting, and diarrhea may occur.

It occurs most frequently in high-rise buildings in urban areas where cats lie on window ledges and suddenly fall out the window. The most common lesions observed in cats that fall from heights are thoracic injuries (rib and sternal fractures, pneumothorax, and pulmonary contusions) and facial and oral trauma (lip avulsions, mandibular symphyseal fractures, fractures of the hard palate, and maxillary fractures). Limb and spinal cord fractures and luxations, radius and ulna fractures, abdominal trauma, urinary tract trauma, and diaphragmatic hernias are also common. The injuries sustained are often found in combination, rather than as an isolated injury of one area of the body. Follow the mnemonic A CRASH PLAN when managing a cat suffering from high-rise syndrome, treating the animal immediately for shock. Following cardiovascular and respiratory stabilization, evaluate thoracic and abdominal radiographs, including those of the spine. Evaluate the bladder closely, making sure that the cat is able to urinate effectively. Examine the hard palate, maxilla, and mandibular symphysis for fractures. Palpate the pelvis and carefully manipulate all limbs to examine for fractures or ligamentous injuries. Finally, perform a complete neurologic examination. Patients that fall less than five stories often have a more guarded prognosis than patients that fall from higher levels. ",

Whenever possible, insert a central venous catheter for fluid infusion and procurement of repeat blood samples. Calculate the patient's dehydration deficit and maintenance fluid requirements and give appropriate fluid and electrolytes over a period of 24 hours. It is advisable to rehydrate patients with severe hyperosmolarity for a minimum of 6 hours before starting insulin administration. Use a balanced electrolyte solution (e.g., Plasmalyte-M, Normosol-R, lactated Ringer's solution) or 0.9% saline solution for maintenance and rehydration. Balanced electrolyte solutions contain small amounts of potassium and bicarbonate precursors that aid in the treatment of metabolic acidosis. Treat animals with severe metabolic acidosis with an HCO 3 \u2212 >11 mEq/L or a pH <7.1 with supplemental bicarbonate (0.25-0.5 mEq/kg). Add supplemental dextrose to the patient's fluids as a carbohydrate source during insulin infusion. Both insulin and carbohydrates are necessary for the proper metabolism of ketone bodies in patients with DKA. The rate and type of fluid and amount of dextrose supplementation will change according to the patient's blood glucose concentration. Serum potassium will drop rapidly as the metabolic acidosis is corrected with fluid and insulin administration. Measure serum potassium every 8 hours, if possible, and supplement accordingly (see section on Fluid Therapy for chart of potassium supplementation). If the patient's potassium requirement exceeds 100 mEq/L, or if the rate of potassium infusion approaches 0.5 mEq/ kg/hour in the face of continued hypokalemia, magnesium should be supplemented.

Replenishing magnesium (MgCl 2 , 0.75 mEq/kg/day IV CRI) often helps to correct the refractory hypokalemia observed in patients with DKA. Patients with hypophosphatemia that approaches 2.0 mmol/L should receive potassium phosphate (0.01-0.03 mmol/kg/hour IV CRI). When providing potassium phosphate supplementation, be aware of the additional potassium added to the patient's fluids, so as to not exceed recommended rates of potassium infusion.

In some cases, however, clinical signs can develop before parturition occurs. Hypophosphatemia may accompany hypocalcemia. Clinical signs of hypocalcemia include muscle tremors or fasciculations, panting, restlessness, aggression, hypersensitivity, disorientation, muscle cramping, hyperthermia, stiff gait, seizures, tachycardia, a prolonged QT interval on ECG, polydipsia, polyuria, and respiratory arrest. Treatment of eclampsia consists of slow, cautious calcium supplementation (10% calcium gluconate, 0.15 mg/kg IV over 30 minutes). Severe refractory tetanus can be controlled with intravenous diazepam. Supportive care includes intravenous fluid administration and cooling (see section on Hyperthermia and Heat-induced Illness).

Clinical signs of severe hypercalcemia include muscle weakness, vomiting, seizures, and coma. ECG abnormalities include prolonged PR interval, rapid QT interval, and ventricular fibrillation. The most serious clinical signs are often seen when hypercalcemia is observed in combination with hyperphosphatemia or hypokalemia. Pay special attention to the \"calcium \u00d7 phosphorus product.\" If this product exceeds 70, dystrophic calcification can occur, leading to renal failure. Renal complications include polyuria, polydipsia, dehydration, and loss of renal tubular concentrating ability. Renal blood flow and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) are impaired when serum total calcium exceeds 20 mg/dL. The extent, location, and number of renal tubular injuries are the main factors in determining whether renal damage secondary to hypercalcemia is reversible or irreversible. Emergency therapy of hypercalcemia is warranted when severe renal compromise, cardiac dysfunction, or neurologic abnormalities are present, or if no clinical signs occur but the calcium \u00d7 phosphorus product exceeds 70. The treatment of choice is correction of the underlying cause of hypercalcemia, whenever possible. In some cases, the results of diagnostic tests take time, and emergency therapy should be initiated immediately, before a definitive cause of the hypercalcemia is found. Emergency management of hypercalcemia consists of reduction of serum calcium levels. Administer intravenous fluids (0.9% saline solution) to expand extracellular fluid volume and promote calciuresis. To promote diuresis, initial intravenous fluid rates should approach two to three times maintenance levels (120-180 mL/kg/day). Potassium supplementation may be required to prevent iatrogenic hypokalemia. Administration of a loop diuretic such as furosemide (2-5 mg/kg IV) will promote calcium excretion. Calcitonin (4 IU/kg IM q12h for cats and 8 IU/kg IM q24h for dogs) can be administered to decrease serum calcium levels. In severe refractory hypercalcemia secondary to cholecalciferol toxicity, more aggressive calcitonin therapy (4-7 IU/kg SQ q6-8h) can be attempted. Side effects of calcitonin treatment include vomiting and diarrhea. Alternatively, bisphosphonates (pamidronate, 1.02-2.0 mg/kg IV) are useful in rapidly reducing serum calcium concentrations.",

Special studies can help detect edema and hemorrhage in the brain and brainstem, and aid in making an accurate diagnosis and prognosis. A cerebrospinal fluid tap is contraindicated in patients with head trauma because of the risk of causing a rapid decrease in intracranial pressure and brainstem herniation. If a compressive skull fracture is present, the patient should be stabilized for surgery to remove the compression. Surgery to alleviate increased intracranial pressure is rarely performed in veterinary medicine because of the poor prognosis and results. In some cases, when a lesion can be localized to one area, 1-to 2-cm burr holes can be placed through the skull over the affected area of the cerebrum, exposing the underlying brain tissue.

In dogs and cats, there are 36 intervertebral disks that potentially can cause a problem. Chondrodystrophic breeds of dogs are predisposed to endochondral ossification and include the Dachshund, Shih Tzu, French Bulldog, Bassett Hound, Welsh Corgis, American Spaniel, Beagle, Lhasa Apso, and Pekingese. Initial examination of the patient with suspected intervertebral disk disease includes identifying the neuroanatomic location of the lesion based on clinical signs and neurologic deficits and then establishing a prognosis. The neurologic examination should be carried out without excessive manipulation of the animal. The presence of pain, edema, hemorrhage, or a visible deformity may localize an area of vertebral injury. Once an area of suspected lesion is localized based on physical examination findings, take radiographs to establish a diagnosis and to institute therapy. In most cases, the animal must receive a short-acting anesthestic for proper radiographic technique and to prevent further injury. Lateral and crosstable ventrodorsal (VD) or dorsoventral (DV) radiographs require less manipulation of the animal compared with traditional VD and DV projections.

The most common cause of HE is congenital or acquired C o m a portosystemic shunts. Acute hepatic destruction can also be caused by toxins, drugs, or infectious causes. The treatment of HE is considered a medical emergency (Table 1 -46) . Absorption of ammonia and other nitrogenous substances from the gastrointestinal tract is thought to be one of the complicating factors in HE. Prevent absorption of ammonia and other nitrogenous substances from the gastrointestinal tract by restricting dietary protein to 15% to 20% for dogs, and to 30% to 35% (on a dry matter basis) for cats. Dietary protein should be from a nonanimal plant source (e.g., soybean) whenever possible. Caloric requirements are met with lipids and carbohydrates. Also prescribe cleansing enemas to rid the colon of residual material, and antibiotic therapy to reduce gastrointestinal tract bacteria. Neomycin (15 mg/kg q6h) can be administered as a retention enema. Metronidazole (7.5 mg/kg PO, q8-12h) or amoxicillin-clavulanate (16.25 mg PO q12h) can also be administered. Administer lactulose (2.5-5.0 mL q8h for cats; 2.5-15 mL q8h for dogs) to trap ammonia in the colon to prevent absorption (Table 1 -46) . Administer lactulose orally to an alert animal, or as a retention enema to a comatose animal. If lactulose is not available, Betadine retention enemas will change colonic pH and prevent ammonia absorption. A side effect of lactulose administration (PO) is soft to diarrheic stool.",

Effusion may be the result of direct fluid production by the mass or may be due to obstruction of lymphatic or venous flow. Hemorrhagic effusions in the abdominal cavity occur most commonly with neoplastic masses of the spleen or liver. The most common causes are hemangiosarcoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. Clinical signs associated with acute abdominal hemorrhage, regardless of the cause, are related to hypovolemic shock and decreased perfusion and include pale mucous membranes, tachycardia, anemia, lethargy, and acute collapse. Treatment for abdominal hemorrhage includes placement of a large-bore peripheral cephalic catheter and starting one fourth of a shock dose (90 mL/kg/hour for dogs, and 44 mL/kg/hour for cats) of intravenous crystalloid fluids, taking care to carefully monitor perfusion parameters of heart rate, capillary refill time, mucous membrane color, and blood pressure. Administer intravenous colloids such as Dextran-70, Hetastarch, and oxyglobin (5-10 mL/kg IV bolus) to restore intravascular volume and normotension. Treat severe anemia with whole blood or packed RBCs to improve oxygen-carrying capacity and oxygen delivery (see sections on Transfusion Medicine and Treatment of Shock).

Prophylactic antibiotics are recommended in the afebrile patient with a neutrophil count <2000/\u00b5L. Acceptable antibiotics include trimethoprim-sulfa and amoxicillin-clavulanate. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (e.g., Neupogen) is a recombinant human product that stimulates the release of neutrophils from the bone marrow, and its use shortens the recovery time following myelosuppressive drug therapy. Disadvantages of G-CSF include antibody production in response to the drug within 4 weeks of use and its high cost. To prevent ongoing neutropenia, subsequent chemotherapy dosages should be decreased by 25%, and the interval in between treatments increased.

The functions of the lymphatic vessels collectively serve to deliver triglycerides and fat-soluble vitamins into the peripheral vascular circulation. Damage of the thoracic duct or lymphatic system or obstruction to lymphatic flow can result in the development of chylous effusion in the pleural or peritoneal space. It is difficult to identify chylous effusions based on their milky appearance alone. To identify a chylous effusion versus a pseudochylous effusion, the triglyceride and cholesterol levels of the fluid must be compared with those of peripheral blood.

The most severe respiratory complications of smoke inhalation are seen in animals that are close enough to the flames to also sustain burn injuries (see section on Burn Injury). At the scene, many animals are unconscious from the effects of hypoxia, hypercapnia, carbon monoxide intoxication, and hydrogen cyanide gases that accumulate in a fire. Carbon monoxide produces hypoxia by avidly binding to and displacing oxygen binding to hemoglobin, resulting in severe impairment of oxygen-carrying capacity. The percentage of carboxyhemoglobin in peripheral blood depends on the amount or carbon monoxide in inhaled gases and the length of time of exposure. Clinical signs of carbon monoxide intoxication include cyanosis, nausea, vomiting, collapse, respiratory failure, loss of consciousness, and death.",

If vascular access cannot be obtained percutaneously or by cutdown methods, intraosseous catheterization should be considered. Once vascular access is achieved, rapidly administer large volumes of crystalloid or colloid fluids. As a rule of thumb, administer 1 /4 of a calculated shock dose of fluids-that is, 1 /4 \u00d7 (90 mL/kg/hour) in dogs and 1 /4 \u00d7 (44 mL/kg/hour) in cats) of a balanced crystalloid fluid ( Normosol-R, Plasmalyte-M, lactated Ringer's solution, or 0.9% sterile saline). Reassess the patient's perfusion parameters (heart rate, capillary refill time, blood pressure, urine output) on a continual basis to direct further fluid therapy. Synthetic colloid fluids (hetastarch, dextran 70, or Oxyglobin) can also be administered in the initial resuscitation from shock. A guideline is to administer 5 to 10 mL/kg of hetastarch or dextran as a bolus over 10 to 15 minutes and then reassess perfusion parameters. Hypertonic saline (0.7% NaCl, 4 mL/kg) can be used in cases of hemorrhagic shock to temporarily restore intravascular fluid volume by drawing fluid from the interstitial space. because this type of fluid resuscitation is short-lived, hypertonic saline should always be used with another crystalloid or colloid fluid, and it should not be used in patients with interstitial dehydration. If hemorrhagic shock is present, the goal should be to return a patient's blood pressure to normal (not supraphysiologic) levels (i.e., systolic pressure 90-100 mm Hg, diastolic pressure >40 mm Hg, and mean arterial pressure \u226560 mm Hg) to avoid iatrogenically causing clots to fall off and hemorrhage to re-start. In critically ill patients, fluid loss can be measured in the form of urine, vomit, diarrhea, body cavity effusions, and wound exudates. Additionally, insensible losses (those that cannot be readily measured from sweat, panting, and cellular metabolism) constitute 20 mL/kg/ day. Measurement of fluid \"ins and outs\" in conjunction with the patient's central venous pressure, hematocrit, albumin, and colloid oncotic pressure can help guide fluid therapy (see also section on Fluid Therapy).

During septic and cardiogenic shock, there is a decrease in contractility secondary to inherent defects of the myocardium or due to the negative inotropic effects of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, myocardial depressant factor, IL-1, and IL-10 released during sepsis and systemic inflammation. Afterload also may be increased because of the compensatory mechanisms and neurohumoral activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis in hypovolemic or cardiogenic shock. As heart rate increases to compensate for a decline in cardiac output, myocardial oxygen demand increases and diastolic filling time becomes shorter.

Secure the urinary catheter to prepuce with a butterfly strip of 1-inch adhesive tape secured around the catheter and then sutured to either side of the prepuce. The catheter should be connected to a closed urinary collection system for cleanliness and to reduce the risk of ascending bacterial infection. An Elizabethan collar should be placed at all times to prevent the patient from damaging or removing the catheter.",

Clinical signs of uroabdomen (azotemia, uremia, hyperkalemia) can also occur secondary to third spacing of urine and leakage into muscular tissue from a ruptured urethra.

Abdominocentesis should be performed in any animal with suspected blunt abdominal trauma, and any fluid obtained should be analyzed for creatinine or potassium and compared with the patient's serum levels. An abdominal effusion that has a low packed cell volume and a potassium or creatinine level greater than that of the patient's serum is consistent with the diagnosis of uroabdomen.",

            "text": "Systemic thromboembolism is most commonly recognized in cats with cardiomyopathies (hypertrophic, restrictive, unclassified, and dilatative) but can also occur in dogs with hyperadrenocorticism, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), protein-losing enteropathy and nephropathy, and tumors affecting the aorta and vena cava. Thrombosis occurs through a complex series of mechanisms when the components of Virchow's triad (hypercoaguable state, sluggish blood flow, and vascular endothelial injury or damage) are present. In cats, blood flow through a severely stretched left atrium is a predisposing factor to the development of clots and thromboembolism.The most common site of embolism is the aortic bifurcation, or \"saddle thrombus.\" Other, less common locations of thromboembolism include the forelimbs, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, and cerebrum. Diagnosis usually is made based on clinical signs of cool extremities, the presence of a cardiac murmur or gallop rhythm, auscultation of pulmonary crackles resulting from pulmonary edema, acute pain or paralysis of one or more peripheral extremities, respiratory distress, and pain and lack of a palpable pulse in affected limbs. The affected nailbeds and paw pads are cyanotic, and nails do not bleed when cut with a nail clipper.Client education is one of the most important aspects of emergency management of the patient with thromboembolic disease. Concurrent congestive heart failure (CHF) occurs in 40% to 60% of cats with arterial thromboembolism. More than 70% of cats are euthanized during the initial thromboembolic event because of the poor long-term prognosis and the high risk of recurrence within days to months after the initial event, even with aggressive therapy. Although the long-term prognosis varies from 2 months to 2 years after initial diagnosis and treatment, in the majority of cats thromboembolic disease recurs within 9 months. Rectal temperature hypothermia and bradycardia on presentation are negative prognostic indicators.Immediate treatment of a patient with CHF and thromboembolic disease involves management of the CHF with furosemide, oxygen, and vasodilators (nitroglycerine paste, morphine, nitroprusside). Additional management includes analgesia (butorphanol, 0.1-0.4 mg/kg IV, IM) and prevention of further clot formation. Aspirin (10 mg/kg PO q48h) is beneficial bcause of its antiplatelet effects. Heparin works in conjunction with antithrombin to prevent further clot formation (100-200 units/kg IV, followed by 250-300 units/kg SQ q8h in cats, and 100-200 units/kg SQ q8h in dogs). Acepromazine can cause peripheral vasodilation and decreased afterload but also can promote hypotension in a patient with concurrent CHF. Acepromazine (0.01-00.02 mg/kg SQ) should be used with extreme caution, if at all.Thrombolytic therapy can also be attempted, but in most cases is not without risk, and may be cost-prohibitive for many clients. Streptokinase (90,000 units IV over 30 minutes and then 45,000 units/hour IV CRI for 3 hours) was administered with some success in cats; however, many died of hyperkalemia or other complications during the infusion. Tissue plasminogen activator (0.25-1 mg /kg/hour IV CRI, up to 10 mg/kg total dose, to effect) has been used with some success but is cost-prohibitive for most clients. Side effects of thrombolytic therapy include hyperkalemia with reperfusion and hemorrhage.In cats, the primary cause of arterial thromboembolism is cardiomyopathy. Once an animal is determined to be stable enough for diagnostic procedures, lateral and DV thoracic radiographs and an echocardiogram should be performed. Ultrasound of the distal aorta and renal arteries should also be performed to determine the location of the clot and help establish the prognosis.Other diagnostic procedures to evaluate the presence and cause of thromboembolism include a complete blood count, serum biochemistry profile, urinalysis (to rule out proteinlosing nephropathy), urine protein:creatinine ratio, antithrombin levels, ACTH stimulation test (to rule out hyperadrenocorticism), heartworm antigen test (in dogs), thyroid profile (to rule out hyperthyroidism in cats, and hypothyroidism in dogs), thoracic radiographs, arterial blood gas analyses, coagulation tests, and Coombs' test. Selective and nonselective angiography can also be performed to determine the exact location of the thrombus.Long-term management of thromboembolism involves management of the underlying disease process and preventing further clot formation. Begin therapy with heparin until the APTT becomes prolonged 1.5 times; then administer warfarin (0.06-0.09 mg/kg/day). Monitoring therapy based on prothrombin time and the international normalized ratio (INR, 2.0-4.0) is recommended. Low-dose aspirin (5-10 mg/kg q48h) also has been recommended. Physical therapy with warm water bathing, deep muscle massage, and passive range-of-motion exercises should be performed until the patient regains motor function. Future therapy may involve the use of platelet receptor antagonists to prevent platelet activation and adhesion.",
