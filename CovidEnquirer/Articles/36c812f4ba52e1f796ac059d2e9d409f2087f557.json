            "text": "Infectious diseases (ID) circulating in the home and community remain a significant concern. Several demographic, environmental, and health care trends, as reviewed in this report, are combining to make it likely that the threat of ID will increase in coming years. Two factors are largely responsible for this trend: first, the constantly changing nature and range of pathogens to which we are exposed and, secondly, the demographic changes occurring in the community, which affect our resistance to infection. This report reviews the evidence base related to the impact of hand hygiene in reducing transmission of ID in the home and community. The report focuses on developed countries, most particularly North America and Europe. It also evaluates the use of alcohol-based hygiene procedures as an alternative to, or in conjunction with, handwashing. The report compiles data from intervention studies and considers it alongside risk modeling approaches (both qualitative and quantitative) based on microbiologic data. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) Hand hygiene is a key component of good hygiene practice in the home and community and can produce significant benefits in terms of reducing the incidence of infection, most particularly gastrointestinal infections but also respiratory tract and skin infections. (2) Decontamination of hands can be carried out either by handwashing with soap or by use of waterless hand sanitizers, which reduce contamination on hands by removal or by killing the organisms in situ. The health impact of hand hygiene within a given community can be increased by using products and procedures, either alone or in sequence, that maximize the log reduction of both bacteria and viruses on hands. (3) The impact of hand hygiene in reducing ID risks could be increased by convincing people to apply hand hygiene procedures correctly (eg, wash their hands correctly) and at the correct time. (4) To optimize health benefits, promotion of hand hygiene should be accompanied by hygiene education and should also involve promotion of other aspects of hygiene.",

However, since the middle of the 20th century, following the development of vaccines and antimicrobial therapy, and with serious epidemics of the ''old'' infectious enemies such as diphtheria, tuberculosis, and others apparently under control, hygiene has tended to lose its prominent position, and the focus of concern has shifted to degenerative and other chronic diseases. Nowhere has the decline in concern about hygiene been more evident than in the home and community.",

In the past 20 years, concern about ID and the need for prevention through home and community hygiene has moved steadily back up the health agenda. Between 1980 and 1992, deaths attributable to ID increased by 22% in the United States alone, representing the third leading cause of death among US residents. 1 Two factors are largely responsible for this trend: first, the constantly changing nature and range of pathogens to which we are exposed and, secondly, the changes occurring in the community, which affect our resistance to infection. To what extent our more relaxed attitudes to hygiene practice have contributed to these trends is not known, but poor hygiene is a significant factor for a large proportion of the gastrointestinal (GI), skin, and respiratory tract (RT) infections, which make up the greatest part of the ID burden.",

Whereas methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium difficile (C difficile) were once considered largely hospital-related problems, this is no longer the case. Now, community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) strains are a major public health concern in North America and, increasingly, in Europe. Most recently, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak and concerns about avian flu have raised awareness of the potential for transmission of respiratory viruses via hands and surfaces. Demographic trends mean that the proportion of the population in the community who are more vulnerable to infection is increasing, whereas trends toward shorter hospital stays and care in the community also demand increased emphasis on care of ''at-risk'' groups in the home who require protection from infection.",

The review also evaluates the use of alcohol-based hand hygiene procedures as an alternative to, or in conjunction with, handwashing. These products are defined by a number of different terms in Europe and North America (hand sanitizers, handrubs, and others). For the purposes of this report, we will refer to them as alcohol-based hand sanitizers (ABHS). Although this report focuses primarily on the home, it is recognized that the home forms a continuum with public settings such as schools, offices, and public transport and cannot be considered totally in isolation. Nevertheless, the hand hygiene practice framework proposed in this review is largely also applicable to ''out of home'' settings.",

Whereas those who manage hygiene improvements often choose to promote hygiene by educating people on the links between hygiene and health, one of the lessons that has been learned is that traditional (cognitive) approaches can raise awareness but do not necessarily achieve the desired effects. If practices such as handwashing are to become a universal norm, a multidimensional promotion that engages the public is needed to persuade people to change their behavior.

The report cites several factors as ''critical for a large proportion of foodborne diseases'' including use of contaminated raw food ingredients, contact between raw and cooked foods, and poor personal hygiene by food handlers. United Kingdom data show that food poisoning notifications reached a peak in 1997-1998 and has since declined but remains in excess of 70,000 per year. 10 In reality, the burden of food poisoning is much higher because most cases go unreported; according to the UK Food Standards Agency, 11 the true number of cases is approximately 4.7 million per year.",

Most frequently recorded pathogens were campylobacter, Salmonella, and norovirus, which accounted for 14.2%, 9.7%, and 66.5%, respectively, of estimated foodborne illnesses. Data suggest that the total number of reported outbreaks has not declined substantially in recent years, ranging from 980 to 1400 outbreaks and between 20,000 and 80,000 cases per year for the years 2000 to 2005. 13 Other infectious GI disease.

In the United Kingdom, even when ''household'' outbreaks are reported, they mostly involve home catering for parties and other functions and are therefore mainly foodborne outbreaks. 15 Because milder cases of GI illness often go unreported, this means that the overall GI infection burden, particularly that which is not foodborne, is unknown; the most informative data on the overall burden of infectious GI illness (both foodborne and nonfoodborne) in the community come from various community-based studies, which have been carried out in Europe and the United States and are reviewed below.",

The UK study, carried out from 1993 to 1996 involving 460,000 participants in the community presenting to general practice, estimated that only 1 of 136 cases of GI illness is detected by surveillance. The study indicated that as many as 1 in 5 people in the general UK population develop GI illness each year, with an estimated 9.4 million cases occurring annually of which about 50% are nonfoodborne. 11, 16 It was estimated that, for every 1 reported case of campylobacter, Salmonella, rotavirus, and norovirus, another 7.6, 3.2, 35, and 1562 cases, respectively, occur in the community; based on the number of laboratory reports, it is possible to estimate the true number of infections occurring in the community (Table 1) .",

            "text": "From the community study carried out in The Netherlands between 1996 and 1999, 17 it was estimated that approximately 1 in 3.5 people experience a bout of infectious GI disease each year. Campylobacter was detected most frequently (10% of cases), followed by Ghiardia lamblia (5%), rotavirus (5%), norovirus (5%), and Salmonella (4%). Relative to the population of The Netherlands (16 million), 650,000 norovirus gastroenteritis cases occur annually. 18 The US study of Mead et al, 12 which also included data from community-based studies, indicated that the total number of cases of infectious GI illness annually is approximately 210 million (of which approximately 64% are nonfoodborne). They estimated that the number of episodes of acute gastroenteritis per person per year is approximately 0.79. From the available data, the authors were also able to estimate the proportion of total episodes that were nonfoodborne. As shown in Table 2 , by far the most frequently reported causes of GI illness were norovirus, rotavirus, and campylobacter. For campylobacter, E coli, and norovirus, a significant proportion of cases was estimated as nonfoodborne, whereas, for hepatitis A (HAV), Shigella, and rotavirus, almost all cases were estimated as nonfoodborne. For Salmonella on the other hand, only 5% of cases were considered as nonfoodborne. Davis et al reviewed outbreaks of E coli O157 related to family visits to animal exhibits. 19 Indications are that norovirus is now the most significant cause of infectious GI illness in the developed world, both outbreak related and endemic. 20, 21 Currently, we are seeing increased outbreaks of norovirus, a major concern in Japan 22 and also in Europe. 23 Expert opinion is that norovirus strains now circulating are more ''virulent'' and more easily spread from person to person via hands and surfaces or during food handling. 20 Infection with HAV is common worldwide, 24 and adenovirus is also a frequent cause of gastroenteritis. C difficile-associated disease now occurs with increasing frequency in the community, in which it usually affects persons receiving antibiotic therapy but also healthy individuals. 25 Recently, a new strain (027) of C difficile has emerged in North America, causing infections in the community among individuals with no predisposing factors. 25 A recent study 26 indicated that exposure to a family member with Helicobacter pylori gastroenteritis was associated with a 4.8-fold increased risk of infection in another family member and that infection most usually involved person-to-person transmission, associated with conditions of crowding and poor hygiene.",

            "text": "Respiratory tract infections are largely caused by viruses. In the United States, viruses account for up to 69% of respiratory infections. 28 The common cold is reported to be the most frequent, acute infectious illness to humans. 29 Data from the United States suggest that the mean number of respiratory illnesses experienced per year in adults is approximately 1.5 to 3.0, and, in children under 5 years of age, it is approximately 3.5 to 5.5. 28 Approximately 80% of upper RT infections are caused by rhinoviruses. Other species causing acute rhinitis are coronaviruses, parainfleunza viruses (PIV), respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV), and adenoviruses. 30 Although colds are generally mild and self-limiting, they represent a significant economic burden because of loss in productivity and medical costs. Furthermore, secondary infections produce complications, such as otitis media, sinusitis, or lower respiratory infections including pneumonia, with its risk of mortality, particularly in elderly adults. Several studies have demonstrated that colds are also a trigger for asthma. 31 RSV is the major cause of viral RT infection in young children worldwide. Child day care attendance in North America caries with it a very high risk of RSV infection within the first 2 years of life and accounts for 0.5% to 1.0% of hospitalized infants in the United States. 32 Influenza is a more serious RT illness, which can cause complications that lead to increased physician visits, hospitalization, and death, the risks being highest among persons aged .65 years, children aged ,2 years, and persons who have medical conditions (eg, diabetes, chronic lung disease). [33] [34] [35] Influenza must also be considered in terms of days absent from work and school and pressure on health care services. 35 An important aspect of influenza is the threat associated with the emergence of novel subtypes capable of causing an influenza pandemic. 36 According to Bridges et al, 37 influenza epidemics in the United States result in an annual average of 36,000 deaths and 114,000 hospitalizations; among those with influenza who belong to an ''at-risk'' group, a significant proportion develop pneumonia, and up to 1 in 10 can die of related complications. In Europe, the 2004-2005 influenza season annual report 38 showed that, of 25 countries, 15 recorded what is regarded as high activity (150 up to 3000 influenza-like or acute respiratory illnesses per 100,000 population).",

Because these infections, apart from S aureus infections go unreported, little or no data are available on the burden of skin and wound infections in the community. S aureus is the most common cause of infections of skin and soft tissue, which, in a small proportion of cases, lead to the development of bacteremia or pneumonia. 40 Serious infections usually occur in health care facilitiesin patients who are immunocompromised-in which S aureus is mostly usually associated with wounds and intravenous devices and in which the antibioticresistant strain, MRSA, is a major concern. Infected patients discharged from hospitals and health care workers (HCWs) caring for MRSA-infected patients can bring MRSA into the home and pass it on to healthy family members, who become colonized, thereby spreading the organism into the community and facilitating the circulation of these strains. [41] [42] [43] MRSA colonization in an individual can persist for up to 40 months. 44, 45 In recent years, MRSA has been increasingly found to cause infections in healthy members of the community without apparent risk factors. 25 These CA-MRSA strains are different from health care-associated (HCA) MRSA strains and are a concern because they equally infect children and young adults. These strains primarily cause skin and soft tissue infections but can also cause invasive infections such as sepsis, pneumonia, and osteomyelitis, which is some cases can be fatal. 25 Some CA strains are known to produce Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), which has been implicated as a virulence factor, 46 although opinion is, however, divided as to whether this is the case; whereas some studies support this notion, 47 others do not. 48 In the United States, CA-MRSA is now a significant concern. CA-MRSA strains have also now been detected in France, Switzerland, Germany, Greece, the Nordic countries, Australasia, The Netherlands, and Latvia. 25 In the United Kingdom, cases of CA-MRSA and PVLproducing strains have been reported, but the number of reported cases is still small. 25, 49 within the global population that affect our resistance to infection.''At-risk'' groups cared for at home include not only newborn infants whose immune system is not fully developed but also the rapidly increasing elderly population whose immune system is declining. ''Atrisk'' groups include patients discharged recently from hospital, immunocompromised family members, and family members with invasive devices such as catheters. It also includes people whose immunocompetence is impaired as a result of chronic and degenerative illness or because they are undertaking certain drug therapies. All of these groups, together with those who carry HIV/AIDS, are increasingly cared for at home by a caregiver, who may be a household member. A survey of the United States and 3 European countries-Germany, The Netherlands, and the United Kingdom-suggests that up to 1 in 5 of the population belongs to an ''at-risk'' group (Table 3) . The data suggest that between 12% and 18% of the population of these countries are .65 years of age. In an intervention study of 148 patients with AIDS, it was found that patients assigned to the intensive handwashing intervention group developed fewer episodes of diarrheal illness (1.24 6 0.9 vs. 2.92 6 0.6 new episodes of diarrhea, respectively, during a 1-year observation period. 50 GI pathogens are now implicated as causative or contributory factors in the development of cancers and other chronic conditions; examples include hepatitis B virus (hepatocelluar carcinoma), 51 H pylori (peptic ulcer disease), 52 and Campylobacter jejuni (Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome). 53 Foodborne illness has been estimated to result in chronic sequelae in 2% to 3% of cases 54 ; a European Commission report 55 cites evidence of chronic disease, such as reactive arthritis, following 5% of Salmonella cases, with 5% of E coli O157 cases progressing to serious and even fatal complications. Even mild viral infections can be predisposing factors to more severe and possibly fatal secondary bacterial infections. 56 ",

Risk management (also known as Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points [HACCP] ) is now the standard approach for controlling microbial risks in food and other manufacturing environments and is becoming accepted as the optimum means to prevent such risks in home and hospital settings. 57 The key feature of the IFH approach is that it recognizes the need to look at hygiene from the point of view of the family and the total range of problems it faces to reduce ID risks, including food hygiene, personal hygiene (particularly hands) and hygiene related to the general environment (toilets, baths, hand basins, surfaces, and others), domestic animals, and family members at increased risk. Adopting a holistic approach makes sense because all these issues are interdependent and based on the same underlying microbiologic principles. HACCP also forms the basis for developing an approach to home hygiene that can be adapted to meet differing needs. Indeed, it is only by adopting such a holistic approach that the causal link between hands and infection transmission in the home can be addressed properly because hand hygiene is a central component of all these issues.",

Additionally, sites at which stagnant water accumulates, such as sinks, toilets, waste pipes, or items, such as cleaning or face cloths, readily support microbial growth and can become a primary reservoir of infection; although microbial species are mostly those that represent a risk to vulnerable groups, primary pathogens can also be present. 58 So long as there are people, pets, and food in the home, there will always be the risk of pathogenic microbes. In many homes, there will also be at least one family member who is more susceptible to infection for one reason or another. Within the home, there is a chain of events, as described in Fig 1, that results in transmission of infection from its original source to a new recipient. To an extent, we can limit the exit and entry of pathogens from and into the body, but the link that we have most control over is that related to the ''spread of pathogens.'' The spread of infection can be interrupted by good hygiene practice, which includes adherence to hand hygiene recommendations and cleaning and disinfecting contaminated environmental surfaces.",

Risk assessment is then based on the frequency of occurrence of pathogenic contamination at that site, together with the probability of transfer from that site such that family members may be exposed. This means that, even if a particular environmental site is highly contaminated, unless there is a high probability of transfer from that site, the risk of infection transmission is low. From this, it is possible to determine the ''critical control points'' for preventing spread of infection. The data suggest the following: d For reservoir sites such as the sink waste pipes or toilets, although the probability of contamination (potentially pathogenic bacteria or viruses) is high, the risk of transfer is limited unless there is a particular risk situation (eg, a family member with enteric infection and fluid diarrhea, when toilet flushing can produce splashing or aerosol formation that can settle on contact surfaces around the toilet). 58,61 d By contrast, for reservoir sites such as wet cleaning cloths, not only is there high probability of significant contamination, but, by the very nature of their usage, they carry a high risk of disseminating contamination to other surfaces and to the hands. d For hands and hand contact and food preparation surfaces, although the probability of contamination is, in relative terms, lower, it is still significant, for example, particularly following contact with contaminated food; people; pets; or other contaminated surfaces such as door, faucet, and toilet-flush handles. Because there is a constant risk of spread from these surfaces, hygiene measures are important for these surfaces. d For other surfaces (floors, walls, furniture, and others), risks are mainly due to pathogens such as S aureus and C difficile, which survive under dry conditions. Because the risks of transfer and exposure are relatively low, these surfaces are considered low risk, but where there is known contamination, for example, soiling of floors by pets, crawling infants may be at risk. Cleaning can also recirculate dust-borne pathogens onto hand and food contact surfaces.",

For example, although risks from toilets, sinks, floors, and others relate mainly to the relatively lower risk of transfer from these sites to hands, hand and food contact surfaces, and cloths, this risk can increase substantially during occasions when an infected family member has fluid diarrhea or when a floor surface is contaminated with vomitus, urine, or feces.

As shown in Fig 3 , exposure to GI pathogens can occur by direct hand-to-mouth contact or indirectly via contaminated food. In the home, food can be contaminated either directly by an infected food handler or indirectly by cross contamination via hands and surfaces from another source, which may be contaminated food, another infected household member (or carrier), or a household pet or farm animal. Hand-to-mouth contact is a frequent occurrence, particularly among children; a study of mouthing behavior in 72 young children showed that children ,24 months of age exhibit the highest frequency, with 81 events/hour; for children .24 months of age, this was reduced but was still of the order of 42 events/hour. 63 The potential for transmission of pathogens from hands to ready-to-eat foods is supported by a number of studies: d In a model domestic kitchen, 29% of food preparation sessions using campylobacter-contaminated chicken resulted in positive campylobacter isolations from prepared salads, cleaning materials, and food contact surfaces. 64 d Bidawid et al 65, 66 showed that touching lettuce with finger pads contaminated with HAV and feline calicivirus (FCV), used as a surrogate for norovirus, for 10 seconds resulted in transfer of 9.2% and 18%, respectively, of the virus. Based on the load for HAV in feces (10 6 to 10 9 viral particles/g), an estimated 1300 particles were transferred to the lettuce. d Rusin et al showed that, when volunteers' fingertips were inoculated with a pooled suspension of Micrococcus luteus (M luteus), Serratia rubidea (S rubidea), and bacteriophage PRD-1 and held to the lip area, transfer rates were 40.99%, 33.97%, and 33.90%, respectively. 67 As stated above, the infection risk from oral consumption depends on the number of bacterial cells or viral particles that are consumed. Table 4 shows that, for many of the commonly occurring GI pathogens, the infectious dose is relatively small.",

These and other studies are also reviewed elsewhere. 82, [92] [93] [94] In developing hygiene policies for preventing GI infections, one of the difficulties is assessing risks associated with hand transmission relative to other risks such as inadequate cooking or storage of food or inhalation of infected vomit particles. Gillespie et al 15 reported an evaluation of reported outbreaks linked to UK households for 1992 to 1999 that suggested, of the 85% of outbreaks designated as foodborne, cross contamination was implicated in 20% of outbreaks compared with 30% and 31% of outbreaks for which inadequate storage and cooking, respectively, were thought to be the cause. There were no data to suggest what percentage of cross contamination events involved the hands, and Gillespie et al 15 expressed concern that most of the reported outbreaks were linked to home catering, thus not necessarily representative of normal daily routine. Aerosol transmission can result from settling on hand and food contact surfaces, but, for norovirus, infection can sometimes result from direct inhalation of infected particles of vomit by people immediately adjacent to the person who vomits. The potential for airborne transmission of norovirus was demonstrated in studies in a restaurant and a primary school, in which close proximity to infected persons in the immediate aftermath of a vomiting attack was identified as a risk factor. 95, 96 Transmission of RT infections. The last 2 years have seen an unprecedented global focus on developing strategies for preventing transmission of influenza. The WHO 97 is taking a lead on pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccines and antivirals but has also made recommendations for other interventions, 98 which include highlighting the importance of hygiene, and in particular hand hygiene, in minimizing spread in the home and community.",

            "text": "Risks from exposure to respiratory pathogens via the hands. As shown in Fig 3, exposure to RT viruses can occur either by inhalation of infected mucous or inoculation of the nasal mucosa or eyes with viruscontaminated hands, which then cause infection via the mucous membranes and upper RT. Rhinovirus and RSV are deposited into the front of the nose or into the eye (where they pass down the lacrymal duct), either on the end of the finger or possibly sometimes in aerosolized droplets. 99 Rubbing the eyes and nose with the fingertips is a common occurrence; Hendley et al found that 1 in 2.7 attendees of hospital rounds rubbed their eyes, and 33% picked their nose, within a 1-hour observation period. 100 A review of the data 94 (Table 6 ) suggests that the infectious dose for respiratory viruses is relatively small. Alford et al suggest that aerosolized doses of as little as 1 TCID 50 (tissue culture infective dose) of influenza virus could infect volunteers. 101 Evidence for transmission of rhinovirus and RSV infections via contaminated hands comes from a number of studies: d A number of studies have demonstrated that selfinoculation by rubbing the nasal mucosa or conjunctivae with rhinovirus-contaminated fingers can lead to infection. 100, 102 Over a period of 10 years, Gwaltny and Hayden performed intranasal challenges on 343 healthy young adults who had no antibody to the challenge, and infected 321 (95%). 103 After handling contaminated coffee cups and other objects, more than 50% of subjects developed infection. 104 Hall et al showed that volunteers touching contaminated objects and/or the fingers of symptomatic individuals had a higher attack rate of colds if they touched their eyes or nose. 105 d In a 4-year family trial, Hendley and Gwaltney 104 found that prophylactic treatment of mothers' fingers with iodine reduced the incidence of RT infections. When illness occurred in the family, mothers were instructed to dip their fingers in iodine upon awakening in the morning, then every 3 or 4 hours or after activities that washed the iodine from the skin. The secondary attack rate in mothers was 7% in the iodine group and 20% in placebo families. No infections occurred in mothers after 11 exposures to an infected index case in the iodine group, compared with 5 infections after 16 exposures in the placebo group. d Hall et al showed that infected infants excrete prodigious amounts of RSV in their nasal secretions for several days 105 and that RSV could be recovered from hands that had touched surfaces contaminated with secretions from infected infants. 99 Hall and Douglas found that close contact with symptomatic infants who were producing abundant secretions, or their immediate environment, was necessary for infection. 106 Sources and spread of RT pathogens to the hands. Figure 3 illustrates that the risk of exposure to RT pathogens via hands depends on the extent to which these pathogens are spread from an infected person during normal daily activities. Relevant data come from various sources and are summarized below. Taken together, the data suggest that, when a household member is infected, exposure of other household members via hands is likely to occur during normal daily activities and that the numbers of organisms involved are within those required to initiate infection if transferred to the eyes or nose.",

            "text": "People infected with cold viruses shed large quantities of virus-laden mucus. Droplets of nasal secretions generated by coughing, sneezing and talking can travel over a distance .3 m to contaminate surrounding surfaces. 37, 98, [107] [108] [109] Up to 10 7 infectious influenza particles per milliliter has been detected in nasal secretions. 110 The mean duration of a cold is 7.5 days. Viral shedding may occur 24 to 48 hours before illness onset but generally at lower titers than during the symptomatic period. Titers generally peak during the first 24 to 72 hours of illness and decline within several days, with titers low or undetectable by day 5. Children can shed virus for up to 3 weeks, whereas immunocompromised people may continue to shed virus for weeks to months. 98 Infectious material can also be deposited directly on hands and tissues during sneezing and blowing the nose. Contamination of hands can occur by handshaking or touching contaminated surfaces. Pathogens shed into the environment from these sources can survive for significant periods and are readily spread around the home to and from the hands and via handkerchiefs and tissues, tap and door handles, telephones, or other hand contact surfaces: d Gwaltney and Hendley demonstrated that most subjects with experimental colds had rhinovirus on their hands and that virus could be recovered from 43% of plastic tiles they touched. 104 For people with rhinovirus colds, virus was found on 39% of hands and 6% of objects in their immediate environment. 100 Opinion as to the importance of the hands relative to the airborne route for transmission of rhinovirus colds is divided. Some investigators 30, 99, 103, 104 maintain that contamination of the hands followed by inoculation of the eyes or nose is of paramount importance; in fact, Gwaltney et al found that it was exceedingly difficult to transmit virus orally or by kissing and found little evidence of droplet or droplet nuclei transmission. 100, 113 Others maintain that the evidence favors droplet and droplet nuclei transmission as the most important mode of spread. 118 For RSV, there is general agreement that the hands are the primary route for the spread of infection. 32, 105, 106 For influenza, although more data are needed, it is increasingly accepted that not only airborne (both true airborne transmission involving droplet nuclei [,5 mm in diameter] and ''droplet transmission'' involving droplets .10 mm that deposit onto surfaces quite rapidly) but also surface (including hand) transmission come into play. 98, 119, 120 The relative contribution of each mode of transmission is unknown but appears to vary depending on the circumstances, symptoms, respiratory tract loads, and the viral strain. 121 Data from animal studies and influenza outbreaks suggest that droplets generated when infected persons cough or sneeze are the predominant mechanism of airborne transmission, 37 although data supporting droplet nuclei spread are also available. 101, [122] [123] [124] It is possible, however, that influenza is less transmissible via hands and surfaces compared with rhinovirus and others because of its lower ability to survive outside a human or animal host. Data suggest that, to some extent, airborne droplets and droplet nuclei cause infection as a result of settling on hand contact surfaces. The frequent occurrence of diarrhea and the detection of viral RNA in fecal samples tested suggest that the H5N1 influenza virus may replicate in the human gut and could be a source of transmission via hands and surfaces. 125 At present, however, it is thought that this is unlikely. The growing evidence base related to the survival, transmission, and human exposure to RT viruses via hands and other surfaces is also reviewed elsewhere. 32, 35, 37, 82, 94, 99 Transmission of skin and wound infections. Risks from exposure to skin and wound pathogens via the hands. As shown in Fig 3, exposure to skin pathogens such as S aureus can occur via the hands. Exposure can produce colonization and/or infection that usually occurs in areas in which there are cuts, abrasions, and others that damage the integrity of the skin. Where there are predisposing factors, the numbers of organisms required to produce infection may be relatively small. Marples 126 showed that up to 10 6 cells may be required to produce pus in healthy skin, but as little as 10 2 may be sufficient in areas in which the skin is occluded or traumatized. Risks associated with exposure to HCA-MRSA and CA-MRSA are different. HCA-MRSA usually affects elderly adults and those who are immunocompromised, particularly those with surgical or other wounds or who have indwelling catheters. For CA-MRSA, those at particular risk appear to be younger, generally healthy people who practice contact sports or other activities that put them at higher risk of acquiring skin cuts and abrasions. 127 US experience suggests that CA-MRSA may be more virulent than other strains and is easily transmissible within households and community settings (eg, schools, day care centers, sport teams) in which skin-to-skin contact or sharing of contaminated items (eg, towels, sheets and sport equipment) are vehicles for person-to-person transmission. 128 A case-control study 129 involving 55 cases of MRSA in a US prison showed that inmates who washed their hands #6 times per day had an increased risk for MRSA infection compared with inmates who washed their hands .12 times per day.",

Figure 3 illustrates that the risk of exposure to skin pathogens via the hands depends on the extent to which people or animals colonized or infected with pathogenic strains are present in the home and the extent to which these pathogens are spread during normal daily activities. Transfer of skin pathogens to the hands can occur either by direct contact with an infected source or indirectly via hand contact surfaces or the surfaces of clothing or household linens. Relevant data, as outlined below, suggest that, when there is a person in the home who is infected or colonized with S aureus, exposure of other household members as a result of transfer via hands, surfaces, clothing, and others is likely to occur during normal daily activities and that the numbers of organisms involved are within the numbers of particles that could initiate an infection in a susceptible recipient.",

In the United Kingdom, indications are that the proportion of the general population carrying antibiotic-resistant strains of S aureus (either HCA-or CA-MRSA) is somewhere between 0.5% and 1.5%, the majority being carriers of HCA-MRSA who are .65 years of age and/or have had recent association with a health care setting. 132 Although cases of CA-MRSA and PVLproducing MRSA have been reported, indications are that the prevalence of MRSA and PVL-producing strains circulating in the community is currently very small. 25 In the United States, although it is concluded that colonization rates for MRSA in the community are still low, it is nonetheless thought to be increasing. 127, 133 Graham et al 131 report on an analysis of 2001-2002 data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to determine colonization with S aureus in a noninstitutionalized US population. From a total of 9622 participants, it was found that 31.6% were colonized with S aureus, of which 2.5% were colonized with MRSA. Of persons with MRSA, half were identified as strains containing the SCCmec type IV gene (most usually associated with CA-MRSA), whereas the other half were identified as strains containing the SCCmec type II gene (most usually associated with HCA-MRSA). Several other investigators have examined the epidemiology of MRSA in the US community; differences in the data suggest a sporadic distribution of CA-MRSA, with carriage rates ranging from 8% to 20% in Baltimore, Atlanta, and Minnesota 127 up to 28% to 35% for an apparently healthy population in New York. 134 Domestic pets can also be a source of S aureus, including MRSA and PVL-producing strains. [135] [136] [137] [138] [139] Manian 136 described 2 dog owners suffering from persistent MRSA infection, who suffered relapses whenever they returned home from the hospital; further investigation revealed that the dog was carrying the same strain of MRSA.",

These and other studies are also reviewed by Bloomfield et al. 25 Intervention studies to establish the causal link between hand hygiene and infectious disease in the home and community Both observational and interventional study designs have been used to assess the relationship between hand hygiene and ID transmission. By definition, observational studies are not randomized and must utilize careful methods to preserve internal validity. Control of confounding and the potential for selection, recall, and other biases are also a concern, for example, individuals who wash their hands less frequently are also less likely to report symptoms. Intervention studies on the other hand compare infection rates in groups in which handwashing is, or is not, promoted. Intervention studies employing randomization of treatment groups have been considered the ''gold-standard'' in terms of reducing selection biases. These studies have the ability to ensure that randomized groups are similar, apart from treatment allocation and differences that occur by chance. For these reasons, we limit discussion to intervention studies, focusing on GI and RT illnesses, because these are the most common infectious illness symptoms in home and community settings.",

For the most part, these studies have been carried out in child day care centers, schools, and military and other public settings in which the outcome is often measured against a high baseline level of infection. Relatively few studies have been carried out in household settings in the United States and Europe. Difficulties associated with studying households in developed areas include fewer children under the age of 5 years, higher level of hygiene infrastructure, and difficulties in collecting data. Given that there are likely fewer susceptible individuals clustered within household settings, the prevalence of GI and RT illnesses is relatively much lower, making it more difficult to detect a significant influence of hand hygiene on the occurrence of illness.",

Studies that are included have been selected on the basis of whether transmission routes are likely to reflect those in the home, most particularly whether the relative rates of transmission via these routes (as shown in Fig 2) are likely to be similar. For this reason, studies on GI infection in developing countries have been excluded; in these settings, limited access to sanitation means that rates of direct hand-to-mouth transmission from feces is high relative to other routes of transmission (eg, person-to-person transmission via hands, or inadequate food hygiene), compared to settings with adequate water and sanitation in which transmission is more likely to involve person-to-person transmission and transmission via food, rather than direct feces-to-hand-to-mouth. For GI illnesses, we have, therefore, focused on studies carried out in developed country communities, although, even for studies such as those in child daycare centers, in which food preparation is not undertaken by study participants, the data probably reflect mainly the impact on person-to-person transmission. For RT infections, studies conducted in both developed and developing countries are included on the basis that relative rates of airborne transmission versus transmission via hands are likely to be similar regardless of setting.",

            "text": "Among the studies in Table 7 , the reduction in GI illness associated with handwashing ranged from 210% to 157%. However, 3 of the 5 studies were not statistically significant, including the study that identified a value of 210%. The studies that gave statistically significant results all describe reductions close to 50%. Overall, these reviews suggest a consistent causal relationship between handwashing and reduction in GI illness, although the findings are less consistent and of a lesser magnitude than in lesser developed settings in which studies considered statistically significant suggested reductions from 26% to 79%. 154 In assessing RT infections, the reviews of Aiello and Larson 151 and Aiello et al, 154 mentioned above, 161 They reported that hand hygiene (handwashing, education, and waterless hand sanitizers) can reduce the risk of respiratory infection by 16% (95% CI: 11%-21%). These investigators have now updated their estimate with 2 further, more recent, studies that, when all studies are taken together, give a pooled impact on respiratory infection of 23%. 162 Based on these studies, Table 8 summarizes the results of community-based interventions (excluding health care-related and military settings) on RT illnesses. Most studies were conducted in economically developed countries (83%, 5/6). The range of reduction in illness was 5% to 53%, but only 33% (2/6) of the studies were statistically significant. The results suggest that hand hygiene education and promotion of handwashing can reduce rates of RT illnesses, but the impact is less than for GI infections, although it must be borne in mind that the available data are more limited. 154 There are also several studies of handwashing that do not distinguish between GI and RT outcomes. 157, 167, 168 These studies measure outcomes such as illness-related absenteeism, making it difficult to assess the impact on specific disease etiologies. Of these studies, only one reported a significant reduction (25%). 157 Two were conducted in day care centers, and 1 was conducted in an elementary school. All 3 studies were conducted in economically developed areas (United States, Sweden, and Israel). 157, 167, 168 Several methodologic issues must be considered for these studies. Studies that use randomization are more likely to produce study groups with similar baseline characteristics. Surprisingly, 40% of the 11 studies in Tables 7 and 8 did not randomize. In some studies, randomization may not be an option (eg, in community settings) because the intervention is too complicated to randomize to multiple groups rather than assigning it to a single geographic area. Controlling for potential confounding variables is also an important issue, for example, if a study did not control for age and included adults as well as children, the effect of a hygiene intervention may be diluted because adults are at lower risk for diarrheal disease compared with children. In randomized studies, adjustment for confounding in the statistical analysis may not be required if potential confounders associated with intervention and control groups appear balanced, for example, randomization of households in the same geographic area may produce intervention and control arms with the same age distributions, hygiene habits, and health profiles. As summarized in Table 9 , of the 11 studies, only 50% (9/18) reported controlling for at least 1 potential confounding factor. Although masking (also known as blinding) can be difficult to implement in hygiene studies because subjects, observers, and interviewers are usually aware of the intervention status, a few studies (2/18) were able to employ masking to reduce knowledge of the intervention. Masking can reduce biases associated with knowledge of intervention, including changes in behaviors, practices, and data collection methods.",

In this section, data on the efficacy of hand hygiene procedures are summarized. A range of test methods has been used to measure the efficacy of hand hygiene products and procedures. Although these methodologies yield valuable data, the results can vary considerably depending on the method used. In 2004, Sickbert-Bennet et al 169 produced a study, based on published literature and their own data, which indicated that factors that affect efficacy measurements are as follows: use of experimental contamination versus normal flora, application method of test organism, type of hand hygiene agent, concentration of active ingredient, volume, duration of contact and application method of the agent, and study method (in vivo panel test vs in vitro suspension test).

In Europe, the efficacy of handwashing is established by panel tests that determine the reduction in the number of organisms released from artificially contaminated hands. The test applicable to handwash products is the Committee European Normalisation Hygienic Handwash Test EN1499. 170 In this test, E coli is inoculated onto the hands and dried. The handwash product is applied to the hands with a rubbing action for either 30 seconds or 1 minute. The residual number of bacteria present on the hands is assessed pre-and postwash by a rinse sampling process and the log reduction determined. To make a claim that a product is a hygienic handwash, it must produce a log reduction in release of E coli from the hands at least equivalent to that produced by a reference soft soap product (mean, 2.76 log in 1 minute; range, 2.02-4.27). In the United States, handwashing is evaluated by a similar panel test using Serratia marcescens as 171 The product, when evaluated by this method, must produce a 2-log reduction after 5 minutes. A range of studies, based on these methodologies, has been carried out to determine the efficacy of handwashing, and are reviewed by Boyce and Pittet, 172 Kampf and Kramer, 173 and Sickbert-Bennet et al. 169 From their assessment, Kampf and Kramer estimated that handwashing produced a mean reduction of up to 2.4 log within 1 minute. Data from individual studies are summarized in Table 10 and suggest that, for E coli, the greatest reduction is achieved within the first 30 seconds, ranging from 0.6 to 1.1 log after 15 seconds to 1.8 to 2.8 log after 30 seconds. Extending the washing time to 1 minute produces a reduction of 2.6 to 3.23 log, but increasing the process for more than 1 minute does not appear to gain any additional reduction. Relatively few data are available on the effectiveness of handwashing in removal of viruses, but the available data (Table 10) suggest that handwashing may be less effective for viruses compared with bacteria.",

In some cases, organisms can be attached to the hands too firmly and may not be removed by handwashing. A study of the spread of Salmonella and campylobacter from contaminated chickens via hands during handling and preparation in a kitchen 176 showed that, although campylobacter were efficiently released from the hands by a 30second rub and rinse process, a 2-minute process was necessary to eliminate Salmonella. The hand rinsing process is also important; Cogan et al 86 showed that, following preparation of Salmonella and campylobacter-contaminated chickens in domestic kitchens, 15.3% of hands and hand and food contact surfaces still showed evidence of contamination even after participants had carried out a washing-up routine with detergent and hot water and then used a cloth to wipe surfaces. Sites contaminated most frequently were hands (20%); dishcloths, utensils, and tap handles (25%); and sink surrounds (30%). These results were confirmed in further studies 176, 177 in which, after cleaning up with a typical routine involving a bowl of hot soapy water and a cloth, although isolation rates from hands of participants were 5% (1/20) for campylobacter, 45% (9/20) of participants still had Salmonella on their hands, and, on 3 occasions, counts recovered were .10 3 colony-forming units. In a further study in which participants cleaned up in the same way but then rinsed their hands under running water for 10 seconds, no samples were positive for campylobacter. However, 15% (3/20) still had low numbers of Salmonella isolated from their hands. Larson et al showed that the quantity of soap (1 mL and 3 mL) used can also have an impact on the microbial reduction achieved by handwashing. 178 Bidawid et al 65, 66 studied the impact of handwashing in preventing transfer of HAV and FCV from artificially contaminated finger pads to pieces of lettuce (Table 11 ). Touching the lettuce for 10 seconds resulted in transfer of 9.2% and 18%, respectively, of the virus. When finger pads were washed before the lettuce was touched, the amount of virus transferred was reduced to 0.39% and 0.4%, respectively. Amounts of HAV and FCV remaining on treated finger pads were 6.5% and 7%, respectively. Surprisingly, virus transfer to lettuce when the finger pads were rinsed with water alone was between 0% and 0.3%, depending on the volume of water used for rinsing.",

            "text": "Barker et al showed that a thorough 1-minute handwash with soap was sufficient to eliminate norovirus from fecally contaminated hands to levels that gave negative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assays. 89 However, Schurmann and Eggers 175 concluded that enteric viruses, particularly poliovirus, may be more strongly bound to the skin and that the inclusion of an abrasive substance in handwash preparations is needed to achieve effective removal. Handwashing was also found to be ineffective in eliminating adenovirus from hands of a physician and patients. 179 For handwashing, a hand-rubbing time of 15 seconds with soap is generally recommended, although the data in Table 10 indicate that 30 seconds to 1 minute is needed to achieve the optimum of 2-to 3-log reduction. In practice, it is doubtful whether people comply with even a 15-second handwash, although there are few data to confirm this. A study of 224 healthy Another study with 52 office workers and students showed a mean log prewash count of 4.81 compared with 5.07 postwash. 181 Kampf and Kramer 173 also reviewed studies from health care settings in which increased bacterial counts were found on the hands after handwashing, and handwashing failed to prevent transfer of bacteria from hands to surfaces. Although there are no data available to confirm this, increases in contamination may result from sweating induced by hot water, which flushes resident bacteria from the sweat glands onto the hand surface or aids detachment of bacteria attached to skin scales. It is important to bear in mind that, although soap and water removes contamination from the hands, soap itself has a limited antimicrobial effect, which means that contamination will be transferred to the sink. Hospital studies show that Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia 182 can form reservoirs of contamination in sink waste pipes and can be a source of infection at times when splashes of contaminated water come in contact with hands. Mermel et al reported that hands of HCWs became recontaminated from faucet handles during a Shigella outbreak. 183 Soap bars also have the potential to spread contamination from person to person via the hands. 88 Efficacy of ABHS ABHS are formulations that contain either ethanol 1propanol or 2-propanol or a combination of these products. Their antimicrobial activity is attributed to their ability to denature proteins. Although products containing 60% to 95% alcohol are most effective, higher concentrations are less effective because proteins are not easily denatured in the absence of water. A range of in vivo and in vitro studies have been carried out to determine the effectiveness of ABHS and are reviewed by Boyce and Pittet, 172 Kampf and Kramer, 173 and Sickbert-Bennet et al. 169 In vivo panel testing of ABHS. In Europe, the efficacy of ABHS is established by panel tests that determine the reduction in the number of organisms released from artificially contaminated hands. The test applicable to ABHS is the Committee European Normalisation Hygienic Handrub Test EN1500. 184 In this test, E coli is inoculated onto the hands and dried. The sanitizer is applied to the hands with a rubbing action for a specified period. The residual number of bacteria present on hands is assessed pre-and posttreatment by a rinse-sampling process and the log reduction determined. To claim that a product is a hygienic handrub, it must produce a log reduction at least equivalent to that produced by a reference product containing 60% vol/vol 2-propanol (mean, 4.24 log in 1 minute; range, 3.17-6.46).",

However, all of the strains referred to in Table 13 are nonenveloped viruses, which are known to be more resistant to disinfectants than enveloped viruses. As far as hand hygiene in the home and community is concerned, however, this is key because many of the viral strains responsible for hygiene-related ID commonly occurring in community settings (rotavirus, norovirus, rhinovirus, and adenovirus) are nonenveloped. That having been said, the data suggest that, although nonenveloped viruses such as HAV and enteroviruses (eg, poliovirus) require 70% to 80% alcohol to be reliably inactivated, studies by Sattar et al 194 In a number of these studies, handwashing with soap was also investigated. These studies 175, 189, 196 showed that the action of ABHS against HAV, polio, and rotavirus was significantly better than that achieved by handwashing with soap. However, in the test model used by Ansari et al 189 and Mbithi et al, 196 inoculated fingertips are exposed to soap solution or ABHS by inverting them over a vial containing the product. In practice, handwashing involving rubbing and rinsing is likely to remove larger numbers of organisms from hands. In a further experiment, Ansari et al 115 also demonstrated that 2-propanol (70%) was more effective (98.9% reduction after 10 seconds) than liquid soap (77% reduction) against rotavirus.",

In an attempt to overcome these problems, Haas et al have applied the technique of Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) to estimate the relative health benefits resulting from use of different hygiene procedures. 204 This approach involves using microbiologic data from the published literature related to each stage of the infection transmission cycle to calculate infection risk.",

            "text": "In a recent study, 205 these investigators developed a model for studying the effect of hand contact with ground beef during food preparation, which was used to study the impact of handwashing and use of ABHS in preventing subsequent transference from the hands to the mouth compared with no handwashing. Pathogenic E coli and E coli O157:H7 were selected for this study because it is known from other investigations 206 that handling ground beef during home food preparation poses a risk of infection with E coli. To perform the risk assessment, data on the density of pathogens in ground beef, transference from beef to hands, removal by handwashing or ABHS, rate of transfer from hand to mouth, and infectivity of ingested pathogens were obtained from the literature and, after screening for data quality, were used to develop probability distributions. For assessing log reductions produced by hand hygiene procedures, only in vivo panel testing data were considered. The median log reduction used in these calculations was 0.3 (range, 0.2-3.0) for handwashing and 4.3 (range, 2.6-5.8) for ABHS. Table 17 shows the estimates of the infection risk from handling raw beef, as obtained from the analysis. The authors note that these risks are conditional in the sense that they quantify the risk to an individual who has handled ground beef and who engages in hand-to-mouth activity. The probability that an individual will engage in such behavior is not known, and, therefore, a direct comparison with actual disease rates cannot be made. However, with some plausible assumptions, it was assessed that, assuming that there are 100 million individuals in the United States, each of whom handles ground beef once per month, this results in 1.2 3 10 9 contacts per year. Assuming that 10% of these individuals contact hand to mouth after handling ground beef, this amounts to 1.2 3 10 8 incidents per year. For E coli O157:H7, using the median risk, this would result in an estimate ranging from 0.014 infections per year if all individuals washed their hands with soap following contact with ground beef to 0.7 infections per year if no handwashing is done. This would equate to a 98% median risk reduction for handwashing compared with no handwashing. If an ABHS was used, this would result in an estimate of 0.00005 infections per year if all individuals used ABHS following contact with ground beef. This would equate to a 99.9996% median risk reduction for use of ABHS compared with handwashing.",

Only 2 of the 5 studies (44%) examining upper RT illness as a main outcome reported a statistically significant reduction. Uhari et al reported a 13% reduction in RT illnesses among children #3years of age, but no significant effect in older children. 211 White et al reported a 20% reduction in upper RT illness among students using ABHS in residence halls. 213 However, this study suffered from several methodologic shortcomings, including lack of control for clustered units, no randomization, no masking, and no monitoring of product use. All but one of the intervention studies included a hygiene education component, but, in 7 of these studies, this was only provided in the intervention arm. The level of education varied widely, ranging from basic information on when to use the ABHS (ie, after sneezing and coughing, after use in the restroom, before lunch) to in-depth education programs 214 and biweekly instructional material designed to educate families on hand hygiene and infection transmission. 215 In all studies, ABHS was promoted as a supplement to handwashing, or as an alternative to handwashing when soap was unavailable, and it is likely that the hygiene education would have had the effect of encouraging more frequent handwashing as well as use of ABHS. Although almost all studies indicated that hygiene education combined with promotion of ABHS can reduce the risks of GI or RT illness, only 2 studies allowed any assessment of the independent effect of the ABHS. Of these 2 studies, Both studies showed a significant reduction in illness-related absences (20% and 44%, respectively), but it is not clear whether the illnesses were predominantly GI or RT because these studies used a loose definition of absence-related illnesses. Sandora et al 215 was the only study carried out in the household setting and, of all the studies, reported the highest reduction for GI illness. The trial involved 292 families with children enrolled in 26 child care centers. Intervention families received a supply of ABHS and biweekly hand hygiene educational materials for 5 months; control families received only materials promoting good nutrition. A total of 252 GI illnesses occurred during the study; 11% were secondary illnesses. The secondary GI illness rate was significantly lower (59%) in intervention families compared with control families (see Table 18 ). A total of 1802 RT illnesses occurred during the study; 25% were secondary illnesses. Although RT illness rates were not significantly different between groups, families with higher ABHS usage had marginally lower RT illness rate than those with less usage (19% reduction). Sandora et al 215 suggested that the difference may be due to heightened diligence associated with using ABHS after a GI-related incident compared with an RT incident, such as sneezing.",

In most studies, either parents or school personnel provided information on ID among children in the study populations. In all but one study, 34 the parents, participants, or personnel monitoring and reporting infections were not masked as to their own or their child's intervention status. Although masking of participants and interviewers to the intervention status is important, because it might influence reporting, it is often difficult to conduct masked hygiene interventions and may not be ethical. Sandora et al determined that it was neither feasible nor ethical to mask subjects or interviewers because it is difficult to devise a formulation that could act as a ''placebo'' for ABHS, and using a placebo ABHS product might endanger the control group via inadequate hand hygiene. 215 In many of the ABHS studies, especially the recent ones, efforts were made to control for potential confounding factors. However, many of the studies did not collect information on baseline hand hygiene practices (nor methods and frequency of cleaning/disinfecting soiled/contaminated environmental surfaces in homes) as well as ABHS use. The studies also excluded participants who reported current ABHS use in the home. Furthermore, participants were asked to refrain from using ABHS in settings outside the home. These are all important design strategies minimizing bias associated with noncompliance or differential usage. Two of the 8 intervention studies failed to use systematic monitoring for hygiene practices, such as frequency of hand-sanitizing episodes, frequency of handwashing, or duration of handwashing. 212, 213 This is especially concerning because the study by Sandora et al suggests that the quantity of ABHS influences the risk of infection in a dose-response manner. 215 Moreover, if frequency of handwashing and ABHS use is not recorded, it is impossible to isolate the independent effects of ABHS from that of handwashing on infection rates. In these studies of ABHS use, surveillance measures included calculating use from monthly demand, total amount supplied, observation by research assistants, participant report, and reported use by primary caregivers in households. 186, 209, 212, 214, 215 ",

If the data from intervention studies (summarized in Table 19 ) are an accurate reflection of the true picture, it is suggested that, for up to 60% of GI illnesses, the hands are the ''sufficient,'' or a ''component'' (see earlier for definitions), cause of spread of infection. This correlates with microbiologic and other data reviewed in this report, which suggest that, although there is a tendency to assume that GI infections are mostly foodborne and result from inadequate cooking and inadequate storage of food, in reality, most GI infections in the home result from person-to-person spread or contamination of ready-to-eat foods within the home, much of which involves the hands as the sufficient or a component cause. For RT illnesses, the intervention study data (summarized in Table 19 ) suggest that transmission via hands could be a sufficient or component cause of up to 50% of illnesses; whereas there has been a tendency to assume that the lower impact of hand hygiene on RT compared with GI infections is due to the fact that spread of RT pathogens is mainly airborne, the microbiologic and other data in this review correlate with the intervention data in suggesting that, for RT infections commonly circulating in the community, such as rhinovirus and RSV, the hands are the major route of spread.",

This variability could well be due to methodologic issues but could also be due to other factors within and between study communities. One possibility is that it relates to differences in the range of pathogens with differing modes of spread prevalent in different study groups, which means that hand hygiene has greater impact in some intervention groups than others. Alternatively, the differences may reflect differing levels of hand hygiene compliance in different intervention groups. In some studies, the quality of the hygiene education, the manner in which the hygiene promotion was conducted, and the enthusiasm with which it was received may have given the intervention group a better understanding of what was required, with the result that they used better hygiene technique and were more likely to apply it at critical times. Although there are no intervention study data to confirm this, the microbiologic data together with the QMRA assessments suggest that even a relatively modest increase in log reduction on hands within a population could produce a significant increase in the health impact of a hand hygiene promotion campaign, which could, in turn, be achieved by addressing the issues in the next 2 sections.",

At present, there is a paucity of data on the efficacy of handwashing in relation to how people actually wash their hands on a day-to-day basis, both in the duration of handwashing and handwashing technique; in most of the intervention studies described earlier no attempt was made to time handwashes or to determine residual levels of contamination on the hands after handwashing. Microbiologic data suggest that, for some pathogens (eg, Salmonella), mechanical removal by handwashing alone is inefficient. These data, together with the results of in vivo panel testing of the effectiveness of handwashing and of ABHS, as described above, question the efficacy of handwashing in community-based groups and suggest that more work is needed to determine the efficacy of hand hygiene procedures under conditions normally encountered in the home and how hand hygiene procedures could be improved.",

It is possible, however, that the potential for increased benefits against bacterial infections compared with handwashing may be offset by reduced efficacy against important nonenveloped viruses such as rotavirus, some strains of rhinovirus, and possibly also norovirus. It has been argued that the higher impact of ABHS interventions against GI compared with RT infections is due to the fact that RT infections are predominantly viral. However, because the intervention data indicate that handwashing also supports a stronger reduction in GI diseases compared with RT diseases, this seems unlikely. Some studies suggest that, to achieve satisfactory activity that includes all types of viruses, higher concentrations up to 80% ethanol should be advised. Other studies suggest that the efficacy of ABHS may be increased by increasing the volume of agent applied to the hands. 215 In formulating policies for hand hygiene, it would be convenient to be able to define what represents a ''safe'' residual level of contamination on the hands after hand hygiene, ie, sufficient to prevent infection transmission, but, because the infectious dose varies from one species to another and is dependant on the immune status of the recipient, this approach is untenable. The QMRA approach, as outlined earlier in this review, however, demonstrates that strategies that produce an increase in the log reduction on hands from 2 to 3 to 4 are accompanied by a significant incremental reduction in the risk of infection in a given population and could thus be worthwhile. This suggests that the health impact from promoting hand hygiene could be increased by developing and promoting procedures for use in the home and community that increase the log reduction of contamination on the hands. This involves identifying products and procedures (both soap-based and waterless products or wipes) that achieve high levels of removal and/or ''kill'' (alone or in combination) of the full range of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and enveloped and nonenveloped viruses and that deliver hand hygiene under conditions that people are prepared to employ in their busy and mobile daily lives. It also suggests that, particularly for ''high-risk'' situations as outlined below, there is advantage to be gained by promoting handwashing followed by use of ABHS to increase the log reduction.",

For example, knowledge regarding the need for handwashing after coughing or sneezing may not be as pervasive as knowledge about handwashing after defecation, and it may be that people understand better when to wash their hands during food-associated activities but not, for example, while handling contaminated tissues.

Whereas risks associated with food handling are largely confined to defined periods of time, for RT and skin infections (and person-to-person transmission of GI infection), the risk is ongoing and involves a large proportion of our ongoing daily activities.

A possible framework for informing appropriate choice according to the particular situation is outlined in Fig 4. This suggests that, in situations in the home and community that are ''standard risk'' (perhaps better described as situations not specifically regarded as ''high risk''), either handwashing or use of ABHS may be chosen. Within this, however, there are factors that advise, or in some cases dictate, choice, for example, handwashing is only an option when there is access to soap and water, whereas use of ABHS is not an option when hands are heavily soiled (although people are likely to choose handwashing in this situation, prompted by the need to ''clean'' their hands). As discussed previously, there will always be situations in the home in which there is increased risk, either because there is a known source of infection or someone who is at increased risk of becoming infected. These situations are summarized in Table 20 . These situations may relate to activities that are carried out routinely in the home, such as handling of raw meat and poultry, or involve household members such as pregnant women or young babies who are otherwise healthy but at increased risk of (or from) infection. They also relate to ''nonroutine'' situations such as a person in the home who is infected with a cold, or norovirus or other GI infections, or to situations in which there is someone who is at increased risk of infection as a result of underlying illness, immunosuppressive drug treatment, or needing catheter or wound care. Although much of the ''health care'' carried out at home is done by trained caregivers, increasingly, there are situations in the home in which simple but risky actions are carried out by household members. In all of these ''increased risk'' situations, as outlined in Table 20 , it is suggested that handwashing followed by use of an ABHS should be encouraged.",

A key benefit of ABHS is that they offer the means to apply hand hygiene in situations in which there is limited or no access to a soap and water. In home care situations, ABHS offer an alternative to handwashing in situations in which other pressures mitigate against finding the time to visit the bathroom for handwashing, for example, when caring for a baby in the nursery or a sick person. They also offer a substitute for handwashing in ''out of home'' settings such as offices and public places, such as public transport or animal exhibits, at which access to soap and water is a particular problem and all of which offer frequent opportunities for hand transmission of infection. Promoting use of ABHS has the potential to get people to undertake hand hygiene more frequently and at critical times. In response to concerns about the possibility of a flu pandemic, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend the use of ABHS for use as an alternative to handwashing. 218 In the event of a flu pandemic, it seems particularly important to encourage people to adopt good hand hygiene in public places.

The global burden of ID accounts for over 13 million deaths annually but, whereas the majority of deaths occurs in the developing world, infection also causes approximately 4% of deaths in developed countries. 223 Although mortality from ID has declined in the developed world, trends in morbidity suggest a change in the pattern of ID rather than declining rates. Several demographic, environmental, and health care trends, as reviewed in this report, are combining to make it likely that the threat of ID will increase in coming years, rather than decline. One such factor is the rising proportion of the population in the community who are more vulnerable to infection. An important part of current European and US health policy is commitment to shorter hospital stays. A key requirement is to ensure that the increased health provision at home is not accompanied by an increase in ID risks; otherwise, the cost savings gained by care in the community are likely to be overridden by costs of rehospitalization. Even for the ''healthy community,'' ID represents a significant economic burden because of absence from work and school and added health care costs. Secondary infections can produce complications, and some infections may be associated with the development of diseases such as cancer or other chronic conditions, which can manifest at a later date. Those responsible for ensuring that the public are protected from infection in health care facilities are now realizing that their ability to manage the problem is hampered by spread of pathogens such as MRSA, C difficile, and norovirus in the community and the home, and the number of infected people or carriers who come into their facilities, and are looking for ways to address this by engaging the public to adopt more rigorous standards of hygiene.",

The health impact of hand hygiene within a given community can be increased by using products and procedures, either alone or in sequence, that maximize the log reduction of both bacteria and viruses on hands. d The impact of hand hygiene in reducing ID risks could be increased by convincing people to apply hand hygiene procedures correctly (eg, wash their hands correctly) and at the correct time. d To optimize health benefits, promotion of hand hygiene must be accompanied by hygiene education and should also involve promotion of other aspects of hygiene, for example, surface and cloth hygiene.",

Virus was found on 35% of objects, including door handles, light switches, pens, faucet and toilet handles, and television remote controls. Some people contaminated none or few sites, most contaminated several, and some contaminated almost all (up to 8) sites. In a second study in which the same subjects stayed overnight in a hotel room in which hand contact surfaces (light switch phone button and handset) had been contaminated with rhinovirus-contaminated mucus, 60% of subjects became contaminated with rhinovirus. d Ansari et al showed that hands readily pick up rhinovirus and PIV by touching contaminated objects. 112 As much as 70% of infectious rhinovirus has been shown to transfer to a recipient's fingers after contact for 10 seconds. 113 In a study with volunteers who handled contaminated doorknobs or faucets, recovery rates from 3 to 1800 plaque-forming units of rhinovirus were obtained from fingertips. 114 d In a study of US day care centers and domestic homes, influenza A virus was detected on 23% of day care center surfaces sampled during the fall of 2003 and 53% of surfaces sampled during the spring. Although no influenza was detected on home surfaces during the summer, influenza was detected on 59% of surfaces sampled during March in 5 homes in which there was an influenza-infected child. No virus was recovered from 3 other homes in which all household members were healthy. Influenza virus was recovered most frequently from telephone receivers (80%) and least frequently from computer keyboards (40%). Other surfaces found to be contaminated included refrigerators; kitchen faucets; light switches; microwaves; TV remote controls; doorknobs; and bath, faucet, and toilet handles. Influenza virus was recovered from 69% of the day care center diaper changing areas, indicating presence of virus in infant feces. 94 Transfer of RT infections via contaminated hands depends on the ability of the virus to survive and retain its infectivity outside the human host. The potential for survival varies significantly between nonenveloped rhinovirus and RSV, compared with the enveloped influenza virus and PIV: d Kramer et al 81 and Hendley et al 100 review data showing that rhinovirus and RSV can survive for significant periods (2 hours to 7 days for rhinovirus, up to 6 hours for RSV) on dry surfaces and for at least 2 hours on human skin. d Ansari et al 115 and Brady et al 116 showed that, although PIV can survive on nonabsorbent surfaces for up to 10 hours, survival on hands was relatively poor (1-2 hours). d Bean et al 117 showed that influenza virus could survive up to 24 to 48 hours on nonporous surfaces and up to 8 to 12 hours on cloth, paper, and tissues. By contrast, virus could be recovered from hands for only 5 minutes and then only if hands were contaminated with high viral titers. Virus could be transferred from nonporous surfaces to hands for 24 hours and from tissues to hands for 15 minutes. Higher humidity shortened virus survival. Virus on nonporous surfaces could be transferred to hands 24 hours after the surface was contaminated, whereas tissues could transfer virus to hands for 15 minutes after the tissue was contaminated. On hands, virus concentration fell by 100-to 1000-fold within 5 minutes after transfer.",
