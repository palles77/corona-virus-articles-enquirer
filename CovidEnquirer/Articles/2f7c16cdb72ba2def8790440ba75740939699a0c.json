These diseases include encephalitis, hepatitis, interstitial pneumonitis, nephritis and enteritis (Piazza, 1969) . The spectrum and severity of disease produced by coronaviruses vary with age and genetic background of the host, route of infection and size of the virus inoculum. Resistance to severe acute infection appears to depend, at least in part, on the potential for replication of mouse hepatic virus (MHV) in cells of the reticuloendothelial system, a genetically restricted event (Virelizier and Allison, 1976; Weiser and Bang, 1976) . Recently, interest in MHV as a model for human hepatitis has been revived as the result of observations implicating variables at the level of the host as important in the pathogenesis of the disease (Krzystyniak and Dupuy, 1981; Levy et al., 1982) .",

Previously, three methods utilized for determining antibody to MHV have been a plaque neutralization assay, immunofluorescence and complement fixation . Neutralization and immunofluorescence, although highly sensitive, are time consuming and complement fixation is too insensitive to be useful. Recently an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA; Kraaijeveld et al., 1980) has been described and has become commercially available, but is too expensive for screening large numbers of mice to be used in a research laboratory working on MHV. We have therefore developed a highly sensitive and reproducible radioimmunoassay which can be used for both screening large numbers of mice and studying the molecular biology and immunopathology of MHV.",

Antibody could be detected with as little as 1 ng of antigen (data not shown) and could be easily detected with 10 ng (Fig. 3) but optimal sensitivity was observed at 25 ng antigen (Fig. 3) with no significant increase noted at 50 ng of antigen per well (Fig. 3) . Therefore, in all subsequent determinations an antigen concentration of 25 ng/lOO pl per well was used. Known positive and negative sera to MHV-A59 were titered against antigen-coated plates. The assay was optimal at a serum dilution of l/200 to l/400 and a dilution of l/250 was chosen to screen all sera. A positive sera was defined as greater than 2 SD above the mean of 5 negative control sera.",

When the RIA was compared to a plaque reduction assay and the commercially available ELISA (Microbiological Associate, Walkersville, MD), it proved significantly more sensitive to either of these assays (Table 2) being 150-fold more sensitive than the plaque reduction assay, and greater than 50-fold more sensitive than the commercially available ELISA. Furthermore, in following seroconversion of MHV-3 infected A/J mice, we were able to detect antibody by the RIA at 3 days when both the plaque neutralization assay and ELISA were negative. At 7 days following infection the RIA was 120 times more sensitive than the ELISA and 400 times more sensitive than the plaque neutralization assay. In addition, using this assay, we were able to detect antibody to a variety of MHV serotypes. Antibody to MHV-3 could be detected with equal efficiency against MHV-3 or MHV-A59 as the target antigen. MHV-A59 was also an adequate target for anti-JHM sera. However, with sera having low levels of antibody to MHV-S (neutralization titers < l/IO) the results of the RIA were erratic using either MHV-A59 or MHV-3 as the target. Using a pool of purified antigens including MHV-A59, MHV-S and MHV-1 we were able to detect sera with neutralization titers as low as l/5 with ease. Hierholzer et al. (1979) demonstrated previously, by a complement-fixation assay, that A59 antigen reacted with antisera directed against a wide variety of strains of MHV. However, there were relative differences in sensitivity to antisera to MHV with antisera to MHV-1 and MHV-S being the least reactive of those examined. The RIA, however, appears to be significantly sensitive so that this is not a problem in most cases.

The method chosen to determine the antibody titer is analogous to other standard serologic end-point dilution assays such as complement fixation, hemagglutination inhibition and plaque neutralization. Because of the shape of the curve (Fig. 3) , it is necessary to do an end-point dilution assay, since the linear portion of the curve is only between l/5 and l/400. The increased sensitivity of the RIA compared to the ELISA is probably due to the use of purified viral antigens and an affinity-purified goat antimouse probe with high specific activity. This probe could detect IgG with high sensitivity as can be seen in Table 1 . In addition, anti-p activity was detected as seen by reactivity to two monoclonal IgM molecules. It appears that the antibody has higher anti-kappa than anti-lambda activity, but it is possible to explain this result on increased binding of kappa myeloma to the plate. IgA was also detected but less efficiently than IgG or IgM. The fact that this probe has all specificities might explain the ability to detect early seroconversion.",

NP-40 treated virion was no more effective than non-detergent treated virus as a target antigen (data not shown). This suggests that the Tween 20 in the buffers is making the viral envelope more permeable, thus allowing internal antigens to be accesssible to antibody. Although the major component of MHV is the nucleocapsid protein ( Fig. 2) at the dilution chosen for screening (l/250), the system is unsaturated and therefore probably detects antibodies to all three proteins in the proportions in which they are present. Further investigations are now under way to rigorously establish whether this is in fact true.",
