            "text": "Shortly after CEPI was created, its interim board adopted a policy regarding 'equitable access' to the vaccines it supports. Its goal was to ensure that low-and middle-income countries would have access to vaccines that CEPI helped develop. The development of that policy was, by many accounts, contentious, and while reflective of the idealism that inspired the creation of CEPI, was felt by others not to be pragmatic or reflect the business realities confronted by vaccine developers. Hence, the interim board instructed that the policy be reviewed ''after one year for initial assessment of alignment between policy and its implementation.\" Key provisions of that initial policy are outlined in Table 1 . While some stakeholders embraced CEPI's original equitable access policy, other entities, including multinational vaccine companies, expressed serious concerns. In particular, potential industry partners saw the policy as inflexible and not open to negotiation; they would have preferred the elements to be seen as 'guidelines' rather than cast as 'policy.' In short, they did not see the provisions as consistent with a competitive business model. For example, developers were most concerned about losing access to intellectual property that may have been developed, or planned to be used, for another commercial purpose. They were also concerned about the possibility that without cause, CEPI could 'step in' and take over a project, transfer it to a competitor, or share data or results they preferred to keep private for competitive purposes. Finally, they were concerned about the precedent that could be set if they allowed an outside entity, in this case CEPI, to set price of a product unilaterally. In contrast, some civil society and academic partners viewed CEPI as funded largely with public monies, and some expressed concerns that development partners might cease development if they decided it was too difficult or expensive. Some felt that any projects funded with public money should be in the public domain, and that CEPI must take definitive steps to set the price of a vaccine to ensure it would be low enough to be affordable by low-and middle-income countries. These differences in perceptions and the wording of the original policy led several capable vaccine manufacturers with demonstrated track records of bringing vaccines to licensure to declare that they could not work with CEPI under the provisions of the policy.",

First, the Secretariat team reviewed the literature to determine the range of approaches taken to define equitable access and their application. From this review it was clear that the term ''equitable access\" was widely applied to a variety of domains (e.g. food, water, health care) but its meaning was rarely specifically defined. As such, it was important for CEPI to explicitly describe what it meant by ''equitable access\" in the context of its specific mission and scope of work. This analysis resulted in an operational definition of equitable access, described at greater length below.",

The Secretariat considered all public comments received, developed another draft policy, and shared this final draft with key stakeholders for another round of consultation. Table 2 summarises the key themes derived from stakeholder consultation and comments over the course of this process and illustrates the diversity of viewpoints and perspectives of CEPI's stakeholders. Relationship between equitable access and price CEPI and awardees agree up front on a transparent and agreed-to methodology for determining the cost of goods for the developed vaccines. Prices for vaccines will be set as low as possible for territories that are or may be affected by an outbreak of a disease for which CEPI funding was used to develop a vaccine. The price will be set [by CEPI] at one affordable to the affected territories and sustainable to the manufacturer. Ensuring vaccine development progresses as planned In the circumstance in which a company is sold, is not financially sustainable, or if the original product developer cannot or is unwilling to continue development of the CEPI-supported product, CEPI sought to ensure that vaccine development could progress as originally planned through the use of ''step-in rights.\" This meant that information, know-how and materials related to vaccine development must be shared with (or transferred to) CEPI so that it can 'take over' all aspects of product development including transfer of responsibilities to another developer of CEPI's choosing.",

For example, the academic institutions and non-profits have been involved in early stage development and have not necessarily experienced the complexities of taking a product to licensure. Smaller companies may be bought and sold before they need to consider the implications of IP policies. Larger companies are more likely to be developing vaccines with the expectation that the IP developed will have uses beyond the development of a CEPIsupported vaccine and see the stakes of sharing such IP (or the commercial benefits of its use) to be much greater. Nevertheless, CEPI found that it has been possible to be flexible in its negotiations while remaining true to equitable access principles, working on a case-by-case basis to invent approaches or adapt old ones to get to a mutually desirable result. For example, CEPI has been successful in agreeing on ''step-in rights\" or like provisions to enable Table 3 Terms for key provisions in CEPI's most recent call for proposals.",
