Emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria has increased the proportion of refractory infections and the challenges of infection control. [2] [3] [4] China has reinforced legislation to control nosocomial infection, drawing extensive support from society and medical community. 5 This transition is reflected in the Chinese governmental response to the epidemic of Middle East respiratory syndrome.",

Investigation showed that patients were infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa endophthalmitis, which resulted from a shortage of surgical equipment and nonstandard disinfection of the surgical instruments. 7 In March 2009, incidence of neonatal nosocomial infection was reported in a maternal and child care service center in the Ji County of Tianjin.
