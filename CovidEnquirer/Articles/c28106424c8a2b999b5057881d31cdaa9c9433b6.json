It has been shown that the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is correlated with viral infection, but its role in PCV2 replication remains unknown. In the present study, we explored the interplay between PCV2 replication and the UPS in PK15 cells and found that treatment with a proteasome inhibitor (MG132 and lactacystin) significantly decreased the PCV2 titer at the early infection stage. We further revealed that inhibition of the UPS did not affect virus entry but decreased viral protein expression and RNA transcription potentially in a cell cycle-dependent manner. PCV2 infection has little effect on the chymotrypsin-like activity, and the gene-silencing of ubiquitin reduced the PCV2 titer, which indicates that the effective replication of PCV2 may be related to protein ubiquitination. Taken together, our data suggested that PCV2 replication requires the UPS machinery, which may represent a potential antiviral target against PCV2.",

The UPS, which regulates many protein targets within cells, plays an important role in a variety of biological processes. The cell cycle-regulated proteins, including cyclins (Glotzer et al., 1991) , p27 (Pagano et al., 1995) , and p35 (Patrick et al., 1998) , are modulated by ubiquitination. The proteasome degrades the majority of the cellular proteins and generates most peptides presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules (Rock et al., 1994) . In addition, ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 is required for MHC class I antigen presentation (Michalek et al., 1993) . Additionally, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) is activated after I\u03baB\u03b1 is phosphorylated and consequently ubiquitinated (Chen et al., 1995) , and the p105 NF-\u03baB precursor for the p50 subunit also requires the proteasome and ubiquitin conjugation (Palombella et al., 1994) . In cultured rat hippocampal neurons, the synaptic activity regulates the postsynaptic composition and signaling through the UPS (Ehlers, 2003) . These above-mentioned studies demonstrate that the UPS not only plays a role in the complete degradation of polypeptides but also regulates the cell cycle, MHC I molecule-mediated antigen processing, and signaling pathways. Furthermore, the UPS also plays major roles in cell viability, DNA repair, protein synthesis, and stress response (Ciechanover and Iwai, 2004; Jentsch et al., 1987; Varshavsky, 2005) .",

The cell supernatants were collected at 12 hours post infection (hpi), and the viral DNA copies were determined by absolute quantitative real-time PCR. Compared with DMSO-treated PK15 cells, MG132 (5 \u03bcM) inhibited the PCV2 titer in the cultured cells by 20.91%, and lactacystin (10 \u03bcM) inhibited the PCV2 titer by 28.09% (Fig. 1B) .

Experimental evidence shows that the UPS plays an important role in the regulation of the cell cycle, including the induction of S, G2/M arrest, and apoptosis (Han et al., 2009) . To investigate whether the downregulation of the PCV2 titer is due to the effect of proteasome inhibitors on cell cycle progression, a flow cytometric analysis was performed based on the DNA content observed in nuclei stained with propidium iodide (PI, Sigma-Aldrich). As shown in Fig. 3 , the percentages of cells in the sub-G1 phase and S phase were approximately 1% and 30%, respectively, and these percentages were not significantly influenced by treatment with MG132. However, a dose-dependent increase in the cell population at the G2/M phase was observed after treatment with MG132, and the increased cell populations after this treatment ranged from 44.6979.84% to 57.4575.93%. Additionally, the percentages of cells in the G0/G1 phase, which ranged from 22.83711.60% to 12.227 7.90%, were significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner with MG132 (Fig. 3B) . A similar trend was also found in the PK15 cells treated with lactacystin ( Fig. 3C ). Taken together, the results reveal that proteasome inhibitors influence the cell cycle progression by prolonging the G2/M phase, which suggests that inhibition of the UPS may suppress the replication of PCV2 in a cell cycle-dependent manner.",

The PK15 cells were first infected with PCV2 and then incubated with a fluorogenic proteasome peptide substrate, and PK15 cells incubated with MG132 or lactacystin were used as the positive control.

            "text": "Proteasome inhibitors regulate the cell cycle progression. In the present study, the inhibitors were found to arrest the cell cycle progression of PK15 cells at the G2/M phase, which is consistent with the results of a previous study (Zanotto-Filho et al., 2010) . PCV2 replication starts from the entry of the single-stranded DNA genome into the nucleus, which resulted in their inclusion in the daughter nuclei at the end of mitosis. Viral replication is initiated by the binding of rep protein complex to the stem loop structure and depends on the cellular DNA polymerase expressed during the S phase (Tischer et al., 1987) . Although the proteasome inhibitors have no effect on the S phase at the early infection stage, the cell cycle is a complex process that involves numerous regulatory proteins. G2/M arrest inhibits cell cycle progression, which may influence the entry of the PCV2 genome into the nucleus and the expression of cellular enzymes. These findings indicate that proteasome inhibitors regulate the replication of PCV2 likely in a cell cycle-dependent manner.",

The findings obtained in the present study, which demonstrate that PCV2 infection appears to have no effect on the proteasomal activity and that the knockdown of ubiquitin reduces the viral titer, highlight the possibility that the PCV2 replication are modulated via protein ubiquitination. The ubiquitination of cellular proteins is required for the effective replication of Coxsackievirus B3 (Si et al., 2008) . In addition, Liu et al. demonstrated that the ORF3 protein of PCV2 decreases the expression of pPirh2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and increases the expression of p53 (Liu et al., 2007) . The interaction between ubiquitination and viral infection requires further study.",
