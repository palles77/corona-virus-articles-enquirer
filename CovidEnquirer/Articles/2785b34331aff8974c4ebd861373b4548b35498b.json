However, since the discovery in 1969 by Mebus (Mebus et al., 1969 ) that a virus was present in feces of calves suffering from diarrhea, it has been proven that rotaviruses can infect calves and cause diarrhea. This discovery prompted the search for related viruses as a cause of diarrhea in other animals. As a result of these investigations, rotavirus has been found to be a major cause of nonbacterial gastroenteritis in most mammals and in fowl (Flewett and Woode, 1978; McNulty, 1978; Woode, 1982) , and it is now accepted that up to 60% of nonbacterial gastroenteritis cases may be caused by rotavirus. The remaining cases of diarrhea are caused by a variety of viral agents, which may include Coronavirus, Torovirus, Calicivirus, Parvovirus, Enterovirus, Adenovirus, Astrovirus, Minireovirus or rota-like viruses (Table 35) . However, the role and prevalence of many of these agents in causing diarrhea has not been firmly established, neither in ruminants nor in other mammals.",

These factors can be broadly grouped into immunological, environmental and nutritional. In each category there are large numbers of components that can interact and alter both the degree of diarrhea and the final outcome of the disease. For example, diarrhea is often associated with inclement weather, i.e. storms, sleet, cold, etc. This is probably associated with increased stress due to temperature fluctuations which can alter the animals' defense mechanisms and increase the probability of infection due to increased animal congregation.",

However, there are reports of virus shedding associated with diarrhea in older animals as well (Von Bonsdorff et al., 1976; McNulty et al., 1978; Jones et al., 1979) . In most cases the infection of older animals is subclinical, and it has been suggested that they serve as virus carriers and are a source of infection for young susceptible animals. In fact, recent reports suggest that removal of carrier animals from a herd reduces or eliminates the disease. The reason for increased severity of diarrhea in younger animals and a higher mortality is that the viruses generally cause greater villous atrophy in the younger animals.",

However, rotavirus was not recognized as an important pathogen in domestic animals until Mebus et al. (1969) identified it as a cause of neonatal diarrhea in calves. Since then it has been demonstrated to play a major role in nonbacterial gastroenteritis in most mammalian species. In most outbreaks the disease occurs suddenly and spreads rapidly to other susceptible individuals. The reason for this rapid spread is that the concentration of virus can reach 10 11 particles per gram of feces, which is equivalent to 10 7 infectious doses (Flewett and Woode et al., 1976a, b) . Experimental inoculation of bacteria-free filtrates containing rotavirus causes diarrhea within 12-24 h in susceptible young animals. Diarrheic animals are also anorexic and can vomit. The reason for such rapid clinical signs is that in the absence of passive antibody or local acquired immunity, the virus infects the enterocytes of the villi, rapidly killing them. The replication cycle of rotavirus is approximately 12 h (Carpio et al., 1981) .",

Viral infection occurs in the enterocytes of the upper half of the villi of the small intestine, resulting in rapid death and sloughing of the cells (see Fig. 179 ). With death, the villi become shortened and loose their adsorptive capacity (Woode and Crouch, 1978) . The cells at the tips of the villi are responsible for production of lactase which aids in digestion of lactose. Thus the combination of reduced adsorptive capacity and reduced enzyme activity accounts for the diarrhea. Since the crypt cells are not damaged, regeneration of the enterocytes and recovery of the villi is generally rapid after the infection is overcome. Animals that recover from the disease return to normal body weight within 10-28 days after infection.",

Coronaviruses have also been identified as a major cause of calf diarrhea (Stair et al., 1972; Mebus, 1978; Storz et al., 1978a) . Bovine Coronavirus diarrhea, like rotavirus diarrhea, occurs within 15-24 h p.i. Early in infection the villous epithelial cells appear morphological normal but they contain large amounts of antigen. Since diarrhea occurs before denudation and loss of enterocytes it is postulated that it is a direct result of infection of the cell and the ensuing redirection of cellular functions from absorption to virus replication. If absorption does not occur there is accumulation of digestive fluids. As the infection proceeds cells are lost from the villi and are replaced by immature squamous to cuboidal epithelial cells which lack the enzymes required for digestion of milk. They also have a reduced absorptive capacity as is the case in all other virus infection of the gastrointestinal tract.",

One such new agent is the Breda virus which has recently been identified. In the case of Breda virus infection, the lesions at first appear similar to Coronavirus infections with respect to location of lesions. However, on closer examination it becomes obvious that the disease is different, since the lesions and infected cells are visible in the lower 50% of the villi and in the crypts of the small intestine. In the colon, infected cells are present throughout the villi and in the crypts. In addition, structurally this virus is not identical to coronaviruses and is related to an equine virus described in Europe (Horzinek et al., 1984) . Recent studies also suggest that other species may have antibody to this group of viruses, which has been tentatively designated as toroviruses (Horzinek et al., 1987) . Parvoviruses can infect a wide variety of animals, ranging from pets to large domestic animals (Kahn, 1978; Storz et al., 1978b) . In contrast to the other viruses discussed so far, this virus family can produce systemic disease as well as enteritis. Since the virus generally replicates in rapidly dividing cells, the lesions are seen in the crypts of both the small and large intestines as well as in lymphoid tissue. Because of the replication in lymphoid tissue this disease can be more severe, especially in small animals, than other viral infections, because of interference with immune responses and damage to the crypts. However, the role of parvoviruses in diarrhea of ruminants is probably small compared to that played by the other agents.",

            "text": "Although these viruses have been associated with diarrhea, there are also many instances where they are present but no disease occurs. Furthermore, it is not always possible to reproduce the disease in conventional or even gnotobiotic animals to the extent that it occurs naturally. Under experimental conditions most attempts to reproduce the disease are made with a single pathogen and more importantly with plaque purified isolates. Replication of these pure populations may be restricted to very localized regions of the intestine; therefore, they do not cause sufficient damage throughout the intestine (longitudinally) to cause the damage required for disruption of intestinal function and diarrhea. Under natural conditions there may be multiple strains of a virus (Sahara et al., 1982) that infect different areas of the intestine, thus causing severe diarrhea. Another explanation for poor reproducibility of diarrhea under experimental conditions could be that avirulent strains grow in culture more rapidly than the virulent strains (Woode, 1982) . If these are used to challenge animals no disease occurs. Another explanation could be related to immunity. If low levels of active or passive immunity are present this would keep the virus infection rate low so as to allow only few viruses to initiate new infections, as is often the case with persistent local infections. However, during stress the immune defense is reduced and virus shedding and diarrhea may occur. When the immune system returns to normal, diarrhea stops but virus may continue to be shed. This type of carrier state would insure the continued presence of the virus in the environment for infection of susceptible neonatal animals. Such carrier states have been demonstrated to occur both in vivo (Leece and King, 1980; Benfield et al., 1982; Crouch et al., 1985) and in vitro (Misra and Babiuk, 1980) .",

The reason for this may be related to the virus tropism for differentiated cells. Because of the difficulty in growing enteric viruses a large variety of tests have been developed to diagnose these agents directly (Yolken, 1982) . Most tests are based on the observation that there are high levels of virus particles present in the feces of diarrheic animals and humans (Woode et al., 1976a, b; Flewett and Woode, 1978; McNulty, 1978) . It is therefore easy to observe virus in feces by EM techniques. However, direct observation is less efficient than if combined with serological tests, as is the case with IEM, where the virus is aggregated by specific sera and can be visualized much more easily. The availability of specific antisera and monoclonal antibodies to numerous viruses makes this a very attractive means of diagnosis. Some enteric viruses may infect cells without causing a CPE or producing infectious virus. In these cases viruses may be identified by culturing in vitro and testing for the presence of viral antigen in infected cells.",

            "text": "In most virus infections of the gastrointestinal tract, regardless of whether the virus has a predilection for the epithelial cells at the tips of the villi or the crypts, there is shortening and occasional fusion of adjacent villi resulting in a reduced absorptive surface (Keenan et al., 1976; Leece et al., 1976; Pearson and McNulty, 1977) . Infection generally begins in the proximal part of the small intestine and spreads progressively to the jejunum and ileum and sometimes to the colon (Mebus et al., 1973; Snodgrass et al., 1977) . This will, however, depend on the initial infective dose, the virulence of the virus strain (Woode and Crouch, 1978) , and the host's immunological status. Thus in the presence of passively acquired antibody, infection can occur but replication is limited to such an extent that either no or only mild diarrhea occurs. In rotavirus and Coronavirus infections, which are limited to the cells at the tips of the villi, the absorptive cells are replaced with immature squamous to cuboidal epithelial cells. Until these cells mature their absorptive capacity and enzymatic activity is greatly reduced. Since they also appear to be relatively resistant to virus infection the disease is often self-limiting if dehydration is not so significant as to cause death (Woode, 1982; Garwes, 1982) . Crypt cells are not damaged and the rate of recovery is therefore generally rapid. In contrast, after infection with viruses that replicate in the crypt cells there is a limited number of new cells available to migrate up the villi and recovery tends to take longer. It should be stressed that although the degree of villous damage may be influenced by the virulence of the virus and the immunological status of the animal, the rate of regeneration of enterocytes and enterocyte maturation may also vary with the age of the animal and the site of virus infection. Since glucose and sodium adsorption are highest in the proximal and middle part of the jejunum (Shephard et al., 1979; Bachmann and Hess, 1982) , damage here would cause most severe diarrhea. In viral infections, the mechanism of fluid loss is considered to be different from that in bacterial infections; however, the net losses may be the same. In viral infections, water is predominantly lost from the extracellular fluid due to impaired adsorption and osmotic loss primarily due to the presence of undigested lactose in the lumen rather than to active secretion (Lewis and Philips, 1972; Philips and Lewis, 1973; Tennant et al., 1978; Graham et al., 1982) . However, replacement of mature adsorptive cells with immature cells, which retain some of their secretory functions, also increases the rate of secretion (Pensaert et al., 1970; Butler et al., 1974; Kerzner et al., 1977) . As the virus kills the adsorptive cells there is also a loss of enzymes which are responsible for digestion of disaccharides. Furthermore, loss of differentiated villous cells diminishes glucose, sodium carrier and (Na + -K + )-ATPase activities, which result in a loss of sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonates and water. The loss of bicarbonate leads to the development of acidosis. However, acidosis also develops as a result of increased microbial activity in response to fermentation of undigested milk (Lewis and Philips, 1978) , as well as the increased lactic acid production and decreased utilization in dehydrated animals (Tennant et al., 1972; Lewis et al., 1975) . Acidosis can create a K + -H + ion exchange across the cellular membrane and inhibit cellular functions required for maintaining normal potassium concentration with a net loss of potassium from cells. The next step that occurs is hypoglycemia due to decreased intestinal adsorption, minimal glycogen reserves in young animals, inhibited glyconogenesis and increased glycolysis (Lewis and Philips, 1978) . This series of complex pathophysiological changes, if not promptly corrected, results in death.",

            "text": "Severity of diarrhea is not only related to the virulence of the infectious agent and the age of the animal but also due to the presence of multiple infections. Only a minority of cases of diarrhea in animals is caused by a single virus pathogen (House, 1978) . Furthermore, it has been suggested that even if a single pathogenetic virus is involved in an infection there may be heterogeneity within the pathogen (Sahara et al., 1982; Spencer et al., 1983) . Therefore, if two viruses co-infect an animal and have different sites of replication, the combined effect may be much more severe than if they infected the animal individually. This may help explain why it is difficult to reproduce enteric infections in conventional calves with single plaque-purified virus isolates. Another important factor is the presence of viral-bacterial synergistic interactions. There is accumulating evidence that many bacterial infections can be more severe if combined with a virus infection (Runnels et al., 1980; Leece et al., 1982) . Thus Escherichia coli generally produces scours only during the first few days of life. However, if an animal is infected with, for example, rotavirus or Coronavirus, \u0395. coli can colonize and produce a more severe disease at a later age (Fig. 180 ). The exact mechanisms by which this occurs is unknown; however, viruses may alter fluid transport by virtue of infecting some cells. This alteration allows the build-up of toxin by bacteria that are normally nonpathogenic. Thus the combination of toxin build-up and decreased mobility of the intestine results in diarrhea. In addition, reduced adsorption of nutrients occurs as a result of virus infection. This provides a more suitable nutritional environment for bacteria to grow, adhere and secrete more toxin.",

Even if the adult animals are immune and transfer antibody to the young, the antibody must be present continuously in the lumen of the intestine to prevent infection, since serum antibodies are not protective Wells, 1976, 1978a,b) . Since many mammalian species do not continue to secrete high levels of antibody in their milk after parturition, the antibody in the intestinal lumen drops rapidly and the young becomes fully susceptible even if it has acquired high levels of serum antibody. Thus, in cattle, the colostrum generally has high antibody levels to most enteric viruses, since the infection rate in adults is high. However, within 5-7 days after parturition antibody levels drop below the threshold required to neutralize virus in the lumen. This is the reason that most enteric virus infections causing neonatal diarrhea in mammals do so after 1 week of age.",

Unfortunately, if the colostral antibodies can protect against virulent virus they will also prevent the attachment of vaccine virus to enterocytes. Thus the supposed early nonspecific protection, possibly by interferon and the later specific immunological protection do not occur unless the animals are immunized prior to ingestion of colostrum. This is often not possible and, therefore, this vaccine has not proven to be as successful as hoped. To overcome this problem a few attempts have been made at in utero immunization but this is impractical at present under field situations (Newman et al., 1978) .

The final method of providing high levels of antibody in the lumen is by feeding monoclonal antibody to the animal.
