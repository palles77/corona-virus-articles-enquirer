            "text": "The primeval notion about immunity to disease arose in Greece about 25 centuries ago from the observation that those who recovered from an apparently contagious disease became resistant to a subsequent similar sickness. The earliest known attempts to intentionally transfer immunity to an infectious disease occurred in China in the tenth century. It involved exposing uninfected people to material from lesions caused by smallpox. This not always successful practice was introduced in the seventeenth century to the Ottoman Empire and subsequently to England and its colonies in North America. This approach was revolutionized by replacing material from human lesions by that derived from cowpox lesions first in 1774 in England by a farmer, Benjamin Jesty, who used it on his family, and 22 years later by Edward Jenner. Thereafter, the widely used vaccination has been considered as the first example of immunization with a life-attenuated virus. Nevertheless, both the cause of the disease and the success of vaccination remained unexplained.",

Further studies fully supported the clonal selection theory (Burnet, Jerne, and Talmage).

This has provided evolutionary advantages allowing the recognition of potentially lethal pathogens, including viruses, and the initiation of protective responses against them (Figure 1) , and represented an add-on to a preexisting innate immune system. For immunoglobulins, somatic variation was further expanded through class switching, gene conversion, and somatic hypermutation. Jawless vertebrates (agnathans) were shown to also have an adaptive immune system based on recombinatorial assembly of genetic units different from those of gnasthostomes, to generate a diverse repertoire of lymphocytes, each with distinct receptors ( Figure 2 ). The assembly relies on highly variable leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein modular units. Most gnasthotomes generate a large part of their immuglobulin diversity in ways similar to those in humans. However, exceptions have occurred. Two of these, relevant to passive immunotherapy and development of diagnostics using the corresponding immunoglobulins, are mentioned here. (1) Only three classes of H-chain genes, corresponding to IgM, IgY, and IgA, exist in chicken. Class switching occurs from IgM to either IgY or IgA. IgY is considered to be the ancestor of 'present-day' IgG and IgE. Unlike human IgG, IgY does not bind to cellular Fc receptors and to proteins A and G, respectively, and does not activate the complement system. (2) H-chain antibodies devoid of light chains occur in the Camelidae species (camels, dromedaries, and llamas). Single-domain fragments from such antibodies react with specific antigens with high affinity constants (nanomolar range). The binding involves longer than average third variable loops of the antibody molecules. These unique antibodies and their antigen-specific fragments are expected to become important for biotechnological and medical applications, including intrabodies (intracellular antibodies).",

PRRs recognize microbial (viral) components defined as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Different PRRs are specific for distinct PAMPs, have distinct expression patterns, activate different signaling pathways, thereby eliciting distinct responses against invading pathogens.

Searching the entire DNA sequence database for similarities with the coding sequence for Toll resulted in identification of Toll-like sequences, and ultimately in discovery of at least 10 functional TLRs in humans. TLRs are type 1 integral membrane glycoproteins the extracellular domain of which contains several LRR motifs and a cytoplasmic signaling domain homologous to that of the interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R). TLRs 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9 recognize PAMPs characteristic for viruses. Viral DNAs rich in CpG motifs are recognized by TLR9, leading to activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type 1 interferon (IFN) secretion. TLR7 and TLR8, expressed within the endosomal membrane, are specific for viral single-stranded RNA (ssRNA). Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), generated TLRs are expressed either at the cell surface or in lysosomal/endosomal membranes. Therefore, they would not recognize pathogens that succeeded in invading the cytosolic compartment. These pathogens are detected by a variety of cytoplasmic PRRs. They include retinoic acid inducible protein (RIG-1) with a helicase domain recognizing viral dsRNA, and a related protein, MDA5. Other proteins which may be involved in innate antiviral immunity include a triggering receptor on myeloid cells (TREM-1), myeloid C-type lectins and siglecs, recognizing sialic acid. One of the elements of both innate and adaptative immunity is the complement system. Some viruses or virus-infected cells can directly activate the complement cascade in the absence of antiviral antibodies.",

            "text": "Adaptive immunity is a complex anticipatory system triggered by exposure to antigens, including viruses. Its hallmarks are selectivity, diversification, specificity, and memory. The principal effector molecules of the system are antigen-binding receptors (immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptors (TCR)). The following simplified overview (see Figure 3 ) will be limited to Ig's and humoral immune responses. Differentiation of B-cells into antibody-generating plasma cells occurs through distinct pathways. Two pathways lead to rapid IgM and IgA antibody production by B-1 cells against T-cell-independent antigens. These antibodies have low antigen-binding constants, and immunological memory does not evolve. The third pathway involves clonal selection. The B-cells synthesize IgM and IgD low affinity antibodies which are expressed as antigen receptors on the surface of cells. Each B-cell produces a different receptor recognizing a distinct epitope. Encounter with the appropriate epitope on an antigen elicits cell division, and generation of selected clones with identical receptor specificities. The clones further differentiate into specific antibody-secreting cells. The remarkable diversity of antibodies is attributable to the fact that genes coding for Ig variable regions are inherited as sets of gene fragments, each encoding a portion of the variable region of a particular Ig polypeptide chain. The fragments are joined together to form a complete gene in individual lymphocytes. The joining process involves addition of DNA sequences to the ends of fragments to be joined, thus increasing diversity. Further diversity arises from the assembly of each Ig protein from pairs of H-and L-chains, each B-cell producing only one kind of either chain (Figure 4 ). In addition, the assembled genes for Ig's mutate rapidly when B-cells are activated by binding an antigen. These hypermutations lead to new receptor variants representing the process of affinity maturation of an immune response. Moreover, B-cells and their progeny can produce an additional variation by altering the constant part of the H chain due to gene rearrangements (\u00bcIg isotype and subclass switching) ( Figures 5-7) . These antibodies have identical paratopes but distinct effector functions (complement activation, phagocytosis, transcytosis, etc.). As a consequence of the aforementioned processes, there are B-lymphocytes of at least 100 million distinct specificities in every human individual at any given time.",

However, the immune response is not restricted to antigenic sites (epitopes and neotopes) on the surface of viruses. Virus particles, following initial infection or provided as a vaccine, also separate into constituent parts. Consequently, unassembled surface subunits (their epitopes and cryptotopes) and internal virus components become exposed to the immune system, ultimately resulting in the production of antibodies having multiple specificities. Only some of these are directed against intact viruses, and may have virus-neutralizing properties. The formation of antibodies with distinct specificities may not be simultaneous but rather sequential. Especially in case of some not directly cytopathic viruses (hepatitis B and C, lymphocytic choriomeningitis, and HIV-1, prone to elicit a chronic carrier state), virus-neutralizing antibodies (VNAbs) appear with a delay after non-neutralizing antibodies.

Coating of virus particles by antibodies is necessary but not always sufficient for virus neutralization. The effectiveness of virus neutralization correlates with the rate of antibody binding to critical epitopes and is augmented by slow dissociation of the formed antigen-antibody complexes. These kinetic parameters can be determined experimentally. Spatial adaptive complementarity, electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals forces contribute to the binding. Experimentally determined virus neutralization can depend on the target cells used. Virus neutralization is a multihit process and is successful when the number of unencumbered viral molecules, essential for initiation of the virus replicative cycle, is brought below a minimum threshold level. The mechanism of neutralization depends on processes obligatory for reproduction of a particular virus, and may involve the following steps: attachment to cell receptors; post-attachment events, internalization (endocytosis); fusion with cell",

A unique feature of several anti-HIV-1 human monoclonal VNAb, having distinct specificities, is a very long finger-like third complementarity determining region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain allowing access to a recessed critical site on HIV-1 gp120. Such feature is rare in the human immunoglobulin repertoire but is common in the Ig's of Camelidae. The mechanism and magnitude of VNAb neutralizing effects are influenced by their immunoglobulin isotype and subtype which affect interactions with complement, Fc receptors, and transcytosis through mucosal epithelia. Non-neutralizing virus-surface-binding antibodies sometimes enhance the effectiveness of VNAb, limit viral spread in the early phases of infection, and contribute to its suppression through antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Antibodies directed to epitopes (or neotopes) on distinct surface proteins may act synergistically in virus neutralization.

A relationship between ADE and disease exacerbation has been observed for dengue, measles, yellow fever, and respiratory syncytial viruses (RSVs). ADE may occur in children infected at a time when the level of transferred maternal antiviral antibodies declines to insufficient levels. ADE could represent an obstacle for development of vaccines, as has been the case for anti-RSV vaccines. A vaccine consisting of formaldehyde-treated measles virus hemagglutinin (ineffective to elicit antibodies to the virus fusion protein) induced antibodies causing ADE and led to aggravated atypical disease following infection with measles virus.",

The sites of these escape mutations are usually on the viral surface, result in structural changes in antibody/ virus contact sites, and lead to much less favorable kinetic parameters for antibody binding or completely abrogate binding. Presentation of new glycan chains on enveloped viruses or elimination of these chains due to mutations of N-glycosylation sites may cause substantial epitope alterations. The rate of escape mutation appearance is promoted by error-prone replication of the viral genome. Antibodies with new specificities must be produced to bring the mutant viruses under control. The process is repeated, and if not successful, persistent infection is established. A similar process leads to evasion from T-cell-mediated protective responses. Secondly, several viruses bypass clearance processes facilitated by the Fc portion of bound antibodies by encoding and expressing Fc receptor analogs. Subversion of the complement cascade provides another way how to block clearance of cell-free virus and infected cells.",

The first signal required for B-cell activation is delivered by binding of antigen (virus) (large red particle) to Ig cell receptors corresponding to monomeric IgM. Internalization and degradation of the antigen, and complex formation of the resulting peptide(s) (small red circle) with MHC class II molecules on the B-cell, allow the second signal to be delivered, that is, by the interaction between CD40 on the B-cell and the CD40 ligand (\u00bcCD154) on the CD4\u00fe helper T-cell, and the engagement of the T-cell receptor (TCR) with the peptide-MHC class II complex on the B-cell. The activation is promoted by binding of cytokines to their specific receptors (seeFigure 10). For comparison (right panel), in case of T-helper-cell-independent antigens, the second signal can be delivered by the antigen itself, either through binding of a part of the antigen to a receptor of the innate immune system (e.g., TLRs; green), or by extensive cross-linking of the membrane IgM by a polymeric antigen.
