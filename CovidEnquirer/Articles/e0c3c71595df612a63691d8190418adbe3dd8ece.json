Adoptive transfer of cloned CD4+ or CD8+ cells prevents the acute encephalitis, and in some cases, eradicates MHV-JHM from the central nervous system (Stohlman et al., 1986; Yamaguchi et al., 1991; Korner et al,, 1991) . In other studies, adoptive transfer of nylon wool-adherent CD4+ T cells was shown to effect viral clearance in infected mice; elimination of CD8+ cells from the recipient abrogated this effect, suggesting that both CD4+ and CD8+ cells were required for maximal effect . In addition, cytotoxic B cells and NK-like cells may have a role in the host immune response to MHV (Stohlman et al., 1983; Welsh et al., 1986; Carman et al., 1986) .",

At 3-8 weeks p.i., 40-900/o developed a demyelinating encephalomyelitis characterized clinically by hindlimb paralysis (Perlman et a/., 1987a) . With the goal of understanding the immune response in these persistently infected mice, we have compared the proliferative T cell response in these mice and that in immunized adult C57BU6 mice. For these experi-ments, we have used recombinant vaccinia viruses (VV) which expressed the three structural proteins (surface glycoprotein (S), the transmembrane glycoprotein (M) and the nucleocapsid protein (N)) and one nonstructural protein, ~28, a basic protein encoded by the putative polymerase gene (Denison and Perlman, 1986; Soe et al., 1987) . The results indicate that the cells from immunized adult mice which specifically proliferate in response to antigen are CD4+ and do not express the lymphocyte surface homing receptor, recognized by the monoclonal antibody gp90) . Gp90 is a lymphocyte-endothelial adhesion molecule that mediates lymphocyte recirculation (Gallatin et al., 1983) .

However, VV does infect syngeneic target cells and using our VV recombinants, we were unable to identify a significant CTL response to the N, M, S, or p28 proteins. While there are several explanations for this data, one possibility is that CTL activity against MHV-JHM is insubstantial in C57BU6 mice and that this is a component of the ineffective immune response to the virus.",

After 4 days in vitro, cells were panned for CD4+ cells which, in turn, were fractionated into gp90-and gp90+ populations. 3 X 1 O4 gp90+ and gp90-cells were incubated in vitro for an additional 24 hr in the presence or absence of anti-CD3 antibody.

Data from triplicate cultures of three separate mice are shown, with the standard error indicated above each bar. same in the two groups of mice and in both cases, the S surface glycoprotein was an effective stimulator for proliferation. An important difference between the two groups was the absence of cells responsive to the M transmembrane protein solely in the persistently infected animals. Other studies have shown that monoclonal antibodies to the M protein protect mice from the acute encephalitis (Fleming et al., 1989) and our results raise the possibility that cell-mediated recognition of this protein may be an important part of an effective immune response to MHV-JHM.",

This stimulation of THl-like cells may be strain-dependent as well as antigen-dependent, since C57BU6 mice show a preferential THl-like response under conditions in which other strains show a THZ-like response (Street and Mosmann, 1991) .

Lymphocyte activation results in down-regulation of gp90, resulting in cells no longer able to home to lymph nodes. Effector cells responding to antigen in viva become gp90-and the gp90-phenotype defines the subpopulation of T cells most active in secreting lymphokines (Bradley et al,, 1991; Mobley and Dailey, manuscript submitted) .
