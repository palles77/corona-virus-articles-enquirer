            "text": "Viruses as obligate intracellular parasites require their host to replicate them and to facilitate their spread to others. In humans, viral infections are rarely lethal, even if they are highly cytolytic to individual cells. Mortality commonly occurs when viruses jump species (such as Ebola or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)), when the virus undergoes a major antigenic change (i.e., influenza viruses), or when host immunity is compromised. HIV represents one of the most dramatic human examples of an exotic virus that kills its host. However, HIV kills slowly, providing ample time to spread to new hosts and an effective strategy for persistence in the species. Death or dire consequences following virus infection in mammals with inadequate immunity are well illustrated by observations that fetuses or neonates, especially if deprived of passive immunity, succumb to many agents well tolerated by normal adults. The increasing wealth of immunological tools, such as transgenic animal models and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) tetramers, have provided sensitive methods for defining the relevance of immune mechanisms for antiviral defense. In most situations, defense against viruses involves multiple immune components, and the impact of a single mechanism varies greatly according to the method by which individual viruses enter, replicate, and spread within the host. In this chapter, we highlight the principal means by which the host achieves immunity following infection by viruses. ",

Most effective of these are the mechanical barriers provided by the skin and mucosal surfaces, as well as the chemically hostile environment of the gut ( Fig. 27.1) . A number of common human viral pathogens enter through the gastrointestinal tract, including rotavirus, enteric adenoviruses, and hepatitis A virus (HAV). These are usually spread via person-to-person contact or contaminated food and water. Respiratory infections caused by influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, measles virus, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are often spread by aerosol transmission, as well as person-to-person contact. Many of the herpes viruses target the skin or the mucosae, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) and VZV. HSV in particular can infect oral and genital mucosa, the eye, and the skin through small cuts and abrasions.",

            "text": "Other herpes viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), target the mucosa. CMV can also spread vertically from mother to baby or rarely via blood transfusions. Human papillomavirus (HPV) targets skin and mucosa and causes warts and may transform cells, inducing cancers such as cervical cancer. Viruses such as West Nile virus, Dengue virus and Semliki forest virus may also enter through the skin via insect vectors. HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) are commonly spread via sexual contact. HIV, HBV, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) can also infect humans via direct entry into the bloodstream via transfusions or contaminated needles. Most human viruses replicate only in certain target tissues, this being mainly the consequence of viral receptor distribution. Many viruses use two receptors, such as the use of the CD4 co-receptor and the chemokine receptor CCR5 by HIV. After attachment to a cellular receptor, viruses may fuse with the cell membrane or be endocytosed and then gain entry into the cytoplasm or nucleus by fusing with the vesicular membrane (enveloped viruses such as HSV and HIV), or translocate across the cell membrane or induce lysis of the endocytic vesicle once in the cytoplasm (nonenveloped viruses such as Norwalk virus and poliovirus). 1 Viruses then utilize host cell machinery and specialized virally encoded proteins to replicate rapidly within the cell. Once they have multiplied within the cell, many viruses induce cytolysis in order to facilitate release of new infectious virions (the poxviruses, poliovirus, and herpes viruses, for example). Other viruses are released from infected cells by budding through the cell membrane in the absence of cell death (e.g., HIV and influenza virus). Having entered the body, however, viruses encounter numerous innate defenses and activate the components of adaptive immunity. The latter usually assures that clinical disease, if not infection, will not become evident. Successful exploitation of these defenses through the use of vaccines remains a central challenge for many human viruses, particularly those that cause chronic infections such as HIV and HCV. 2",

            "text": "Viral infection induces an extensive array of defense mechanisms in the host. Innate defenses come into play to block or inhibit initial infection, to protect cells from infection, or to eliminate virus-infected cells; these occur well before the effectors of adaptive immunity become active (Chapter 3). The innate immune defenses are initiated via pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). These include transmembrane receptors of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family, two families of intracellular receptors including the NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and the RIG-I-like helicases (RLHs), as well as the sensor molecule absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) ( Table 27. 2). These cellular sensors promote the expression of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-18, type I (a/b) interferons (IFN-I) and a variety of IFN-stimulated genes and inflammatory cytokines. TLRs are cell surface or endosomal membrane-bound proteins expressed by numerous cells including dendritic cells (DC), macrophages, lymphocytes, and parenchymal cells. Expression of TLRs is largely inducible in most cell types, though some (TLR7/8/9) are constitutively expressed at high levels by specialized plasmacytoid DC for rapid IFN production. Different TLR molecules recognize specific viral products such as single-and double-stranded RNA (TLR 3 and TLR7/8, respectively) or double-stranded DNA (TLR9). Much of our understanding of the roles of TLRs to antiviral defense have been discovered in mice, yet our understanding of the similarities and differences in the functions of human TLRs is rapidly improving. 3 The more recently discovered RLHs, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene (MDA-5), mediate cytoplasmic recognition of viral nucleic acids. 4 These activate mitochondrial antiviral signaling proteins (MAVS) to stimulate IFN-I production and activate the inflammasome, a molecular complex that facilitates the activation of caspases and induces the production of proinflammatory IL-1b and IL-18. 5 NLRs are a second class of cytosolic sensors of PAMPS that activate the inflammasone. 6 These include the NLRP (or NALP), NOD, and IPAF/NAIP receptors. Three major inflammasomes have been shown to be involved in antiviral immunity: the NLRP3 inflammasome, the RIG-I inflammasome, and the AIM2 inflammasome. Other cytoplasmic sensors of viruses, such as the more recently discovered cytosolic dsDNA sensor DAI (DNA-dependent activator of IFN), may also play important roles in sensing viral pathogens.",

The longest known and best studied antiviral proteins are the a/b IFNs, which act by binding to the type I IFN receptor and result in the transcription of more than 100 IFN-stimulated genes. One consequence of this \"antiviral state\" is the inhibition of cell protein synthesis and the prevention of viral replication. 7 Type I IFNs also activate natural killer (NK) cells and induce other cytokines such as IFN-g and IL-12 that promote NK responses (Chapter 17). NK cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, they can kill infected cells and interact with DC, and are an important component of innate defense against viruses. NK cells are regulated by an array of activating and inhibitory receptors whose expression and function are just beginning to be understood. Uninfected cells are usually protected from NK cell cytolysis as they deliver negative signals such as high expression of MHC molecules. In contrast, virus-infected cells are killed either because they deliver positive signals or because they lack adequate MHC-negative signals. The NK defense system appears important against some herpes viruses, which downregulate MHC expression in the cells they infect. NK cells are also important in resistance to mouse and human cytomegalovirus, and possibly to HIV, influenza virus, and Ebola viruses. 8 A distinct NK cell population, NKT cells, may provide some antigenspecific innate immune protection against certain viruses. 9 Many other leukocytes are involved in innate defense, including macrophages, DC, neutrophils, and perhaps T cells expressing gd T-cell receptors for antigen. Furthermore, tissue cells including fibroblasts, epithelial and endothelial cells express PRRs and can respond to viral infection via the production of innate cytokines, including IFN-I and IL-1.",

These include natural antibody, which may play a role in defense against some virus infections, as well as the pentraxins and complement proteins. 10 Some viruses may be directly inactivated by complement activation or be destroyed by phagocytic cells that bind and ingest complement-bound virions. Several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines induced by virus infection also play key roles in defense. Foremost among these is IL-1 and other members of the IL-1 family, including IL-18 and IL-33. 11 These cytokines influence both innate and adaptive immune cells and play critical roles in antiviral defense. Other anti-viral cytokines are produced early following infection, such as TNF-a, IFN-g, IL-12, IL-6, and chemokines such as MIP-1a. In particular, IL-12 is a potent inducer of IFN-g from NK cells. Inflammatory chemokines may also play an important role in innate antiviral defense by orchestrating macrophage, neutrophil, DC, and NK responses at the site of infection (Chapter 10). Not only are these components of innate immunity involved in mediating initial protection against viruses; several components (such as the PRRs, the cytokines IFN-I, IL-I, and IL-12, and phagocytes including macrophages, monocytes, and DC) serve to shape the nature and effectiveness of the subsequent adaptive response to viral pathogens.",

The two major divisions of adaptive immunity, antibody and T-cell-mediated, are mainly directed at different targets. Antibodies usually function by binding to free viral particles, and in so doing block infection of the host cell. In contrast, T cells act principally by recognizing and destroying virus-infected cells, or by orchestrating an inflammatory response that includes several antiviral components. As all viruses replicate within cells and many can spread directly between cells without re-entering the extracellular environment, resolution of infection is reliant more on T-cell function than on antibody. Antiviral antibody, however, does assume considerably more importance as an additional immunoprotective barrier against reinfection. It is the presence of antibody at portals of entry-most often mucosal surfaces-that is of particular relevance to influenza, HSV, and HIV infections. 12 Accordingly, vaccinologists try to design vaccines that optimally induce mucosal antibody.",

The antibody involved in humans is predominantly secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA), but serum-derived IgG may also be protective, particularly in sites such as the vaginal mucosa. Both antibody isotypes act mainly to block infection of epithelial cells, although in some instances the antibody may transport antigen from within the body across epithelial cells to the outside. Mucosal antibody persists for a much shorter period than does serum antibody, which explains in part why immunity to mucosal pathogens is usually of much shorter duration than is immunity to systemic virus infections. Like B-cell responses, T-cell responses to viral infections also begin within the lymphoid tissues. Specific CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) precursors recognize antigen in the context of MHC class I-peptide antigen complexes on professional APC, such as DC. The CD8 T cells become activated, proliferate, and differentiate into effectors. Expansion of these na\u00efve antigenspecific precursors is considerable, often exceeding 10,000-fold, and results in an effector population that can account for 40% or more of a host's total CD8 T-cell population (Fig. 27.2 ). Various factors, including antigen and APC, co-stimulatory molecules (such as CD28 and 4-1BB), and inflammatory cytokines (such as IFN-I and IL-12) are required to program the development of functional effector lymphocytes. 17 The CTL effectors enter the efferent lymph and bloodstream and access almost all body locations, including both primary and subsequent sites of infection. However, effectors do not stay activated for long once the virus is cleared, and approximately 95% die by a process termed activation-induced cell death. Following this contraction phase, the remaining cells differentiate into memory cells, which remain as a more or less stable population in the host for many years. They represent an expanded pool of CTL precursors that can be activated upon secondary encounter with antigen, and provide enhanced protection upon reinfection with the same virus (see next section). Though much of our knowledge of T-cell responses to viruses have been obtained using mice, recent work has demonstrated that most of the fundamental principles (described below) are the same or similar in humans. 18 T-cell immunity against a particular virus commonly involves both CD4 and CD8 T-cell subsets. Both CD4 and CD8 T cells recognize peptides derived from viral antigens bound to surface MHC proteins (class II and class I, respectively). Complexes of viral peptides bound to MHC class II proteins are generated by APC from scavenged and processed virus-infected cells or viral particles. Antigen-MHC class I complexes are expressed on the surface of infected cells, and antigen can also be transferred to APC from infected cells by a process known as cross-presentation. 19 Recent experiments in mice have also demonstrated a role for transfer of antigen between DC 20 as they migrate from infected tissues to the lymphoid tissues. Curiously, although many peptides derived from viral proteins have an appropriate motif that permits MHC binding, the majority of CD8 T cells, and possibly CD4 T cells, are often specific for a few immunodominant epitopes. Use of MHC class I and class II tetramers to directly visualize antigenspecific CD8 and CD4 T-cell responses, respectively, has demonstrated the significant size of T-cell responses to viruses and that the majority of the activated T cells seen at the peak of the response are virus-specific.",

The differentiation of CD4 T cells into effectors occurs in a manner very similar to that with CD8 T cells. At present less is known about the size and specificity of CD4 Tcell responses, but effector CD4 T-cell populations appear to consist of a broader epitope specificity than CD8 T cells responding to a given virus. CD4 T cells are activated by recognizing viral peptides associated with class II MHC molecules, which are present on more specialized cells such as APC. Thus, CD4 T cells rarely recognize viral epitopes present on cells as a consequence of viral gene expression within that cell, dictating their function as helper cells for B cells and CD8 T cells, and as producers of cytokines for help and viral clearance.",

More commonly, however, effector CD4 T cells act by synthesizing and releasing numerous cytokines following their reaction with antigen (Chapter 9). Subsets of CD4 T effectors produce different groups of cytokines. The type most often involved in antiviral defense are designated T-helper 1 (Th1) cells, and primarily produce IFN-g, LTa, TNF-a, and IL-2 to help orchestrate the inflammatory response and act directly or indirectly in antiviral defense. Conversely, Th2 effectors produce an array of cytokines that may downregulate the protective function of Th1 cells, such as IL-4, IL-5, and two anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 and transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b). Th2 T cells play a protective function against some parasite infections (Chapter 29), though in some virus infections an exuberant Th2 response may be associated with immunopathology or impaired immunity. Indeed, blocking the Th2 cytokine IL-10 was recently shown to assist in the clearance of chronic viral infection. Th17 cells that produce IL-17, and also IL-22, are generated under certain inflammatory conditions, though it is unclear whether these cells play a vital role during viral infections. 22 Lastly, CD4 T cells can differentiate into T follicular helper (Tfh) cells following interactions with antigen-specific B cells, which are important for germinal center formation and antibody responses to viruses. 23 ",

Humoral memory to viruses involves long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow that provide a continuous low-level source of serum antibody. This maintenance of humoral immunity also involves a population of homeostatically maintained memory B cells, which may be required to maintain stable numbers of long-lived plasma cells over time. The pool of memory T cells is regulated by low-level homeostatic division controlled by the cytokines IL-7 and -15.

The CD62L lo CCR7 lo T EM subset is found primarily in non-lymphoid tissues and spleen, whereas the CD62L hi CCR7 hi T CM subset is largely present in the lymph nodes and spleen. The current model predicts that effector T cells form the T EM subset and these cells gradually convert to a T CM phenotype over time. Though the conditions that control the rate of this conversion are unknown, it is likely that the amount of antigen and inflammatory signals received during the effector phase greatly influences this. It has also been shown that CD4 T-cell help is required for the generation of long-lived memory CD8 T cells, via interactions with DC. 21 Studies suggest that T CM are capable of mounting stronger proliferative responses following reinfection. However, the tissue-specific homing of T EM cells permits them to reside in sites of potential viral infection, such as the skin and mucosae. Indeed, the hallmark of a recently described subset of memory CD8 T cells involves long-term residence within tissues at sites of previous viral infection.

The most successful human viruses can escape the immune system and persist for the life of the host. 33 Two well-studied examples of this are CMV and EBV. T-cell responses to these viruses are prominent and readily detectable in people, yet the immune system is unable to clear either pathogen completely. However, these viruses generally remain undetectable in immunocompetant individuals. Other viral infections, such as those caused by the herpes viruses HSV and VZV, are marked by periods of latency, where no virus can be detected. Yet periods of viral reactivation, often triggered by stress, can lead to episodes of disease. These are controlled by the immune response, which plays a central role in controlling herpes virus latency. 34 Many of the most medically important human viruses are associated with persistent viremia. These include chronic infections such as HIV, HCV, HBV, and human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), among others. Such viral infections are marked by high levels of persisting antigen and can result in skewed T-cell immunodominance hierarchies, altered tissue localization of immune cells, and severely impaired T-cell function. 33 This altered T-cell function is hierarchical and results in functional T-cell defects ranging from reduced cytokine production and altered proliferative capacity (exhaustion) to death (deletion) of the responding T cells (Fig. 27.4) . Recent work has shown that viral antigen levels are responsible for this immune dysfunction. 35 This is in stark contrast to normal memory T-cell development, which occurs in the absence of persisting antigen (see previous section). Recent studies have demonstrated that signaling through the cell-surface receptor programmed death (PD)-1 on effector CTL causes exhaustion during chronic infections. 36 This pathway may be essential for preventing excessive immunopathology by effector T cells, yet appears to contribute directly to failed immunity to HIV infection, and other chronic human viral infections. These studies implicate this pathway as a potential therapeutic target.",

            "text": "Typically, individual humans respond to a virus infection in different ways. When the common cold or even pandemic influenza infection occurs, only a small percentage of exposed persons may develop overt clinical disease. In the pre-vaccine days, poliomyelitis was a much-feared consequence of poliovirus infection, but only a very small percentage of infected persons developed the paralyzing complications. Similarly, only an unfortunate few develop life-threatening meningoencephalitis following infection with the insect-transmitted West Nile fever virus. It is particularly characteristic of chronic viral infections that clinical expression is highly variable. With hepatitis C, for example, 70-80% of patients develop some form of chronic liver disease and fail to clear infection. However, up to 30% do control the infection, clear virus, and can be immune to reinfection. The latter group of individuals make a type of immune response that includes protective antibodies along with an appropriate pattern of T-cell responsiveness. 37 We do not fully understand the reasons for the varying outcome of virus infections in different persons and almost certainly multiple factors are involved. Many of these factors impact the response pattern made by the innate immune system that in turn affects the magnitude and type of adaptive immune response that occurs. Some of the circumstances that do influence the outcome of infection include genetic susceptibility of the host, the age of the host when infected, the dose and route of infection, the variable induction in the host of anti-inflammatory cells and proteins, and the presence of concurrent infections and past exposure to cross-reactive antigens. 37 Immunopathology and autoimmunity Immune responses against virus-infected cells often result in tissue damage, especially if cell killing is involved or there is extensive recruitment and activation of inflammatory cell types such as macrophages and sometimes neutrophils. If the response is brief and is quickly repaired, it is usually judged as an immunoprotective event. A prolonged tissue-damaging effect resulting from an immune reaction against viruses is considered immunopathology. Such situations most commonly involve persistent viruses, which are themselves often mildly cyto-destructive in the absence of an immune reaction. Chronic tissue damage initiated by viruses may also result in development of an autoreactive and an occasionally oncogenic response. For example, some autoimmune diseases (AID) may be initiated or exacerbated by virus infections, but no named virus has been regularly incriminated as a cause of human AID. 38 Circumstantial evidence exists for a virus link in multiple sclerosis (MS), insulin-dependent diabetes, and possibly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In MS, many viruses have been isolated from patients, although no specific one has been tied to the disease etiology. The current hypothesis is that viral infections set up an inflammatory environment that may exacerbate or tip the balance towards disease in genetically susceptible individuals. 38 Immunopathological reactions involving viruses have several mechanisms, but T cells are usually involved as orchestrators of the inflammatory events (Table 27 .4). The clearest example of immunopathology involving a virus is lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in the mouse. This model has dominated ideas and has set several paradigms in viral immunology in general. The first virus-induced immunopathological lesion recognized was glomerulonephritis and arteritis, noted in mice persistently infected with LCMV. The lesions were assumed to represent inflammatory reactions to tissue-entrapped immune complexes that activate complement. Similar immune complex-mediated lesions occur in other infections, which include lung lesions found in severe influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, as well as viral hepatitis and arthritis. 39 However, only rarely have viral antigens been shown to contribute to the antigen component of the complex. An example where the inclusion of viral antigen in immune complexes has been demonstrated is chronic hepatitis B virus infection of humans. Autoimmune disease such as SLE also results from immune complex-mediated tissue damage. However, evidence linking viruses to the etiology or pathogenesis of SLE is scarce, since the immune complexes in SLE do not appear at any stage to include viral antigens.",

In LCMV damage occurs in the leptomeninges of immunocompetent mice infected intracerebrally. Hepatitis can also occur in mice infected intravenously. Neither lesion becomes evident if the CD8 T-cell response is suppressed. CD8 T-cell-mediated immunopathology is a causative mechanism of chronic hepatitis associated with hepatitis C and B infection as well as with some lesions that occur 40 The immunopathological mechanisms involved in hepatitis B infection have been carefully analyzed in a mouse model in which the whole HBV was expressed as a transgene. In this model, CD8 T cells orchestrated the immunopathology, but the process was complex. Initially, CTL-mediated killing events occurred, but since hepatocytes die by apoptosis it was not clear how this related to subsequent inflammatory events. However, the CD8 T cells also released numerous cytokines and chemokines that recruited inflammatory cells, primarily macrophages. Interestingly, liver-infiltrating CTL have been shown to be inhibited by PD-1-PD-L1 interactions, which may greatly reduce the severity of local immunopathology. Additional viral immunopathology models where lesions result primarily from CD8 T-cell involvement include myocarditis and insulin-dependent diabetes associated with coxsackie B virus infection. In both instances, CD8 T cells mainly orchestrate events, but tissue damage may result from the bystander effects of cytokines and other molecules such as lipid mediators, metalloproteinases, and components of the oxygen burst. Although coxsackie virus can be a cause of diabetes in the mouse, attempts to relate viral infection directly to the etiology of human diabetes have so far failed. 38 C l i n i c a l R e l e v a n c e",

Most commonly Th1 cells are responsible for such reactions, but Th17 and occasionally Th4 subsets may also play the main role. One well-studied example involves persistent infection with Theiler's virus in mice. 41 This infection causes a demyelinating syndrome that resembles the AID experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. In both situations, CD4 T cells that produce Th1 cytokines appear to serve as the pathologic mediators. Furthermore, in both models an increase in the involvement of myelin-derived autoantigens occurs as the disease progresses. Once again, such observations indicate the possible role of a virus in an autoimmune disease. With the Theiler's virus model the virus persists in the nervous system and chronically stimulates CD4 T cells to secrete an array of cytokines. The demyelinating events appear to result from cytokine action on oligodendrocytes. Myelin components such as myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, and myelin oligodendroglial glycoprotein may be released and participate as additional antigens in immunoinflammatory events. This scenario is referred to as epitope spreading.",

The chronic immunoinflammatory lesions are mainly orchestrated by CD4 T cells, but multiple early events occur that induce the subsequent pathology.

The role of Th17 T cells as orchestrators of inflammatory reactions has been a major research focus especially in lesions of AID. 22 When Th17 T cells are the principal mediators of tissue damage, there is an abundance of neutrophils recruited to the inflammatory sites, with such cells mainly responsible for the tissue damage.",

With human autoimmune disease, there is little direct support for viral molecular mimicry; however, some animal models have been used to prove the theoretical case, using a model where a viral antigen is expressed as a self-protein in the islet cells of the pancreas.

Evidence for this has been reported in several viral infections, including HCV, HIV, and influenza virus. 43 It is interesting to note that Treg function may be both beneficial to the host, by limiting immunopathology, and detrimental, due to reduced local T-cell responses and thus prolonged viral persistence.

The discovery of multiple inhibitory receptors on exhausted T cells (including PD-1, LAG-3, 2B4, TIM-3, etc.) provides the opportunity to selectively improve T-cell function through blockade of these inhibitory receptors. This may be combined with blockade of immunosuppressive cytokines (such as IL-10), or enhancement of signals stimulatory to the response (such as IL-7 therapy), as well as with more traditional anti-viral therapies and vaccination. The challenge that lies ahead will be in determining which combination of inhibitory and stimulatory signals will need to be manipulated in different diseases and in different groups of patients. The design of new generation vaccines to target diseases such as HIV and influenza virus may require tailor-made solutions for patients who respond poorly to vaccination, or respond improperly through adverse effects such as autoimmune reactions. High throughput approaches now allow for the generation of a molecular signature of vaccination or infection. Such systems biology approaches are expected to result in novel screening for immune protection parameters after vaccination. In the near future this should also assist in the formulation of new vaccines containing key immune activators, such as those that stimulate certain subsets of T cells, or induce appropriate homing molecule expression on these cells to direct them to tissues where they are required to mediate protection (such as mucosal sites, or the skin).",
