Its specificity was verified by inclusion of control samples containing transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and rotavirus A in each analysis. Eighty porcine field samples of faeces obtained from 38 herds affected with diarrhoea were examined, and PEDV was found in 15 (19%) samples from 6 (16%) herds. The suitability of the CB-ELISA for the screening herds in epizootiologic situations is discussed. #",

Serological examination allows asses-www.elsevier.com/locate/vetmic Veterinary Microbiology 105 (2005) 9-17 sing earlier contacts of sows with the virus, but even litters from seropositive sows are not protected against infection if the milk contains non-protective antibody levels. Therefore, information on a current epizootologic situation in a herd is best obtained by virus detection. Besides virus isolation, immunohistochemical and electron microscopic detection methods are often used (Guscetti et al., 1998; Kim et al., 1999; Rod\u00e1k et al., 1999) . As these techniques are labourious and time demanding, only few samples are usually examined. This holds also for highly sensitive and specific methods of molecular virology (PCR, RT-PCR) (Ishikawa et al., 1997; Kweon et al., 1997; Kim et al., 2000) , although miniaturization and automation of e.g. real-time PCR methods are gradually reaching the veterinary diagnostic laboratory.",

Therefore, detection methods are the necessary prerequisite for assessing the current epidemic situation in herds and for subsequent immunoprophylactic measures. Conventional methods (virus isolation, immunohistochemical detection of PEDV) are laborious and time consuming. Therefore, the objective of our study was to assess methods for the detection of viral agents. Blocking ELISA methods of PEDV detection in samples of piglet faeces in the form of double antibody sandwich ELISA) have been used previously. Polyclonal (Callebaut et al., 1982) or monoclonal (Carvajal et al., 1995) binding and detection antibodies, and standard dilution of SwSneg./pos. were employed. The sensitivity and specificity of these methods depended particularly on the quality of the antibodies. High specificity of PEDV detection is obtained particularly by the ELISA method using monoclonal antibodies. However, lower sensitivity of ELISA variants with conjugated mAb was detected in our experiments (Table 1) . Therefore after the assessment of three variants, we selected the CB-ELISA based on the use of non-conjugated mAb as optimal. PEDV detection specificity reached by the CB-ELISA method was also proven by the negative results obtained by examinations of crude V-Ag samples of TGEV and rotavirus A (Table 2 ).",

            "text": "We have found that some samples might be incorrectly evaluated by both the DAS and CB-ELISA analysis of mixtures with standard dilutions of faeces and SwSneg./pos. All samples with high absorbance values but low blocking percentages were taken as positive in repeated analyses under different conditions of sample or SwSneg./pos. dilution. Also some samples with originally low absorbance but high percentages of blocking were similarly evaluated as positive ( Table 2) . Determination of viral agents in faecal field samples by EM and blocking ELISA method examinations may be affected by several factors. The time of sample collection after the first symptoms of diarrhoea had emerged and the conditions of shipment are important. High fragility of coronaviruses in the contents of intestines was proven (Aynaud and Bottreau, 1984) . Therefore, the finding of the characteristic peplomer structures of coronaviruses by EM is less frequent than the finding of ''corona-like particles'', which are in fact cellular substructures. The low correlation between the results obtained by EM and CB-ELISA may be explained by that fact. Because of its sensitivity and specificity, the CB-ELISA method is seen as most suitable for routine detection of PEDV gastroenteritis. Similar results were obtained in our studies with TGEV (unpublished data) and group A rotavirus detection (Rod\u00e1k et al., 2004) . The objective of our ongoing studies is the implementation of these methods to obtain information on the incidence of viral gastroenteritis in pig herds. The methods will allow subsequent confirmation of the effect of targeted immunoprophylactic measures, including immunisation of sows or prophylactic administration of antiviral antibodies to piglets (Men\u0161\u00edk et al., 1978; Shibata et al., 2001) , according to current epidemiological situation.",
