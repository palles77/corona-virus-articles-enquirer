Community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) pneumonia may occur in previously healthy patients with no prior healthcare exposure, often after influenza and can predispose to severe necrotizing pneumonia. The incidence of CA-MRSA currently remains low but needs consideration in any younger patient requiring physiological support for severe CAP. The Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) exotoxin (also referred to as Toxigenic St. aureus) is strongly associated with virulent strains of St. aureus. The PVL gene is carried by both MRSA and methicillin-sensitive St. aureus (MSSA). Most PVL-SA strains are currently MSSA, although there is an increasing association with CA-MRSA infection. PVL-SA strains are usually associated with community-acquired infections, producing a particularly severe form of haemorrhagic pneumonia that is often preceded by a 'flu-like' illness or necrotizing soft tissue infection ( Table 2 ).

In recent years, we have seen the appearance of several virulent respiratory strains that can cause a severe pneumonic disease, progressing to multiorgan failure. These have included avian influenza A virus (H5N1), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), influenza A virus (H1N1), and severe acute respiratory syndrome. Viral pneumonias often have seasonal predilection and may be preceded by a viral prodrome inclusive of fever, myalgia, Severe community-acquired pneumonia non-productive cough, and headache. Pregnancy, obesity, chronic disease, advanced age, and immunosuppression are risk factors for severe illness and development of complications. Nearly 20% of patients with CAP who have proven bacterial pneumonia are co-infected with a virus. It is often unclear if the viral organism is the primary causative pathogen or has predisposed the patient to secondary bacterial infection. 2,3 Secondary bacterial infection was reported in 4-24% of patients requiring critical care admission during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. Streptococcus pneumoniae, St. aureus, and H. influenzae were the more common pathogens isolated in these patients in addition to the virus. Mixed infections are thought to induce a more severe inflammatory response in comparison with an individual pathogen, with variable and overlapping signs and symptoms occurring. Although biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) are more significantly raised in bacterial disease, they are insufficiently sensitive or specific to be used as sole diagnostic indicators to aid differentiation between bacterial and viral pneumonias. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays enable concurrent recognition of multiple viruses and is now the gold standard diagnostic test. Routine use of these assays has substantially progressed epidemiological knowledge of respiratory viruses. PCR may be performed on nose and throat swabs and nasopharyngeal and tracheal aspirates.",

Urine antigen tests are more sensitive than blood cultures and will remain positive even after the patient has been exposed to appropriate antibiotic therapy. It is, however, of note that Legionella urine antigen testing will only detect serogroup 1 which is responsible for 80-95% of CAP due to Legionella species and therefore may provide falsely reassuring information. As a general rule, urine antigen tests are most useful for 'ruling in' rather than 'ruling out' disease, as a negative test result for a specific pathogen may only have a sensitivity of 40-86% in early infection and thus false-negative results are not uncommon.

Risk stratification tools that are used regularly include the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), British Thoracic Society (BTS) CURB-65 score (Table 4) , and Severe Community-Acquired Pneumonia Score (Table 5 ) jointly produced by the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Disease Society of America (ATS/IDSA). 2 Both PSI and CURB-65 have been more extensively validated to recognize low-risk patients and are not as good at predicting need for critical care support. Other risk stratification scores have been developed, including SMART-COP (Table 6) , which was created to help identify patients who may require invasive respiratory or vasopressor support. 4 Both ATS/IDSA and SMART-COP perform well as risk stratification tools in identifying patients who require ICU admission, but further validation is required for both.",

Early appropriate parenteral antibiotic administration has been demonstrated to improve patient outcomes, particularly in patients at a higher risk of death. 8 The majority of patients that die with severe CAP tend to do so from complications of multiorgan failure rather than from primary respiratory failure alone and often require renal replacement therapy, invasive circulatory monitoring, and support. Adherence to protocols such as those produced by the BTS or IDSA/ATS is associated with a reduction in overall mortality. 2, 9 Respiratory Patients with respiratory failure despite high-flow oxygen therapy can be managed with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or invasive ventilation. 10 NIV is of particular benefit in those patients who are immunosuppressed, have underlying obstructive lung disease or Pneumocystis jiroveci infection. A lower Pa O2 =FIO 2 ratio and bilateral alveolar infiltrates suggesting acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are independent predictors of NIV failure and in such patient groups, progression to invasive mechanical ventilation should be considered at an early stage. Early Severe community-acquired pneumonia identification of a failed NIV trial is important as several trials have demonstrated poorer outcomes in patients requiring intubation after a prolonged unsuccessful NIV trial. Most patients with severe CAP will require intubation and mechanical ventilation, particularly in the presence of persistent hypoxaemia, severe acidosis, depressed consciousness, or progressive hypercapnia. These patients should be managed with a lung-protective ventilation strategy using low tidal volumes (6 ml kg \u22121 predicted body weight) and plateau airway pressures <30 cm H 2 O. Although high PEEP levels may improve oxygenation, there is no mortality difference in comparison with ventilation using low PEEP except in ARDS with a Pa O2 =FIO 2 ratio <200 mm Hg. 11 Advanced respiratory rescue techniques including prone ventilation, extra-corporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO 2 R), and extra-corporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO) should be considered in cases of refractory hypoxaemia or symptomatic hypercarbia. 12",

Coverage for atypical bacteria and MDR pathogens should be considered if risk factors for these pathogens are present (Table 2) . Atypical and MDR pathogens are more common in patients requiring ICU care. Patients with severe CAP treated with combination antibiotic therapy including a macrolide have an improved survival rate compared with monotherapy. Empirical macrolide monotherapy should be avoided due to emerging pneumococcal resistance. Once a pathogen is identified, antibiotic coverage should be narrowed unless there are concerns about dual pathogen infection. This approach is associated with fewer complications, reduced risk of Clostridium difficile infection, and minimizes development of antibiotic resistance. In severe disease, septic shock or in a non-responding patient, continuous infusions of time-dependent antibiotics such as \u03b2-lactams and carbapenems may improve outcome. There is however an elevated risk of both line-related infections and thrombophlebitis, both of which are more prevalent in immunosuppressed patients. 14 In patients admitted to ICU, the ideal duration of antibiotic therapy remains uncertain. The BTS and NICE guidelines suggest 7-10 days antibiotic treatment initially. If infection with St. aureus or a gram-negative bacilli is suspected or confirmed, antibiotic therapy should be continued for 14-21 days. 9 Cavitating pneumonias and lung abscesses are usually treated for several weeks. Short-course antimicrobial therapy has the potential to improve efficacy and minimize the emergence of resistant organisms. The use of biomarkers such as highly sensitive PCT or CRP may help to reduce the duration of antibiotic treatment without an increase in either mortality or treatment failure.",
