Western analysis on the purified protein confirmed the expression and purification of the NC fusion proteins from yeast. To determine its antigenicity, the fusion protein was challenged with serum samples from SARS patients and normal controls. The NC fusion protein demonstrated high antigenicity with high specificity, and therefore, it should have great potential in designing clinical diagnostic tools and provide useful information for vaccine development.",

Of various methods to overproduce proteins of interest, the yeast system was chosen to express the fusion protein based mainly on two major considerations. First, the cloning procedure is simplified by taking advantage of the homologous recombination cloning strategy in yeast because it is a restriction and ligation reaction-free system, which remarkably simplifies cloning procedures. Secondly, most posttranslational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, could be reserved in the eukaryotic expression system (16) . These properties may play an important role in immunoreaction. Our data provided firm evidence that the antigenicity of the N protein was well preserved in the NC fusion protein.",

This model was established for other coronaviruses and recently confirmed by Northern analysis of the SARS-CoV-containing Vero-6 cells using a 3 terminal probe (7) . If the co-terminal model is correct, the N gene in all other 3 co-terminal subgenomic transcripts would be translated into huge amount of the N protein in addition to the N-specific transcripts, unless a possible mechanism stop or inhibit the ribosome binding site of the gene from translation with the subgenomic transcripts.",

There are only two possible reasons why the N protein is freely exposed to the host immune system. First, the virus collapses after injecting its genome into the host cells. Second, the extra N protein, after binding to the genomic RNA in a fixed molecular ratio, would not be packaged by the cellular liquid bilayer membrane and therefore remains in the cytoplasm. When the host cells collapse, the N protein is released. The most possible mechanism is that the N protein is engulfed by the antigen presenting cells (APC) and presented to T cells for the adaptive immunity. Whether the N protein is involved in the process of the innate immunity remains to be revealed.",

Both Western and ELISA analyses demonstrated that the N protein fragment render highly specific immuno-response in the SARS pa-tients.

The nucleotide positions (29,211-29,369) refer to the complete genome sequence of BJ01.

Briefly, the RT-PCR product was amplified using the NC primer pair and cloned into pGEM-T. The recombinant pGEM-T plasmid was used as the template for PCR with the yeast-cloning primer pair, and the PCR product was co-transformed into yeast competent cells with Hind III/XbaI-linearized pEGH vector (17) . The correct reading frame in the recombinant vector was con-firmed by sequencing through the junction between the vector and insert.
