A rectal temperature >39.5\u00b0C was denoted as fever. A positive result of five different diagnostic tests for CRD was defined as: (1) a positive S-Hp with fever absent, (2) a positive S-Hp with fever present, (3) either a positive S-Hp or fever, (4) both a positive S-Hp and fever, and (5) fever (regardless of S-Hp). The sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of each test were calculated from regression coefficients of generalized linear mixed models of the binary test results, applying a logit link. Apart from CRD status (within the 14 days before sampling; no or yes), the models included sex (bull or heifer), and for the test based on S-Hp alone, also rectal temperature (fever, no or yes). Confidence intervals (CI) of Se and Sp were estimated by simulation.",

In Sweden, the use of group housing systems is increasing, especially the use of large group pens with rationalised milk feeding (Pettersson et al., 2001) , and hence increased problems with CRD can be expected unless proper measures are taken.

The present study comprised 833 of the 892 calves from the above experiment, i.e. all calves which were successfully sampled for S-Hp at between 3 and 8 weeks of age. The number of studied calves per herd was 42-155 (median: 103). The calves were Swedish Reds (52%), Swedish Holsteins (40%), crossbreeds between milk breeds including Jersey (6%) or crossbreeds with a beef breed, such as Aberdeen Angus, Charolais, Hereford or Simmental (3%).",

Considering all different tests and eight different S-Hp cut-off values, 25 models were thus constructed. Apart from the disease status (CRD test : 0 = no; 1 = yes), variables representing parity of the dam, breed, sex, rectal temperature, month of year, and week of age were tested for inclusion as predictors. Only sex and rectal temperature were statistically significant (P 6 0.05 in most cases). Sex was retained in all models, rectal temperature was retained in the model of the HP(T\u00c0) and HP(T+) tests, while the remaining predictors (P > 0.05) were omitted. To account for herd-level clustering, herd was included in all models as a random-intercept effect. The overall model fit was good (generalized Chisquare statistic divided by its degrees of freedom 0.97-1.03). Based on point estimates of the regression coefficients from the models, test sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) were calculated separately for each model as described by Dohoo et al. (2003) .",

AUC together with Se and Sp estimates were used to choose the test with the best performance.

Although the time of diagnosis may not truly reflect the time of onset of the disease, it is likely nevertheless that most of the diseased animals had a short history of disease. Most of the cases of CRD test therefore may have been of a quite acute type and probably to a large extent caused by viral infections. The majority of these cases went unrecognized by the calf carers, and were mild. It has generally been considered that viral infections give a weaker acute phase reaction than bacterial infections (Spooner and Miller, 1971; Godson et al., 1996; van Leeuwen and van Rijswiijk, 1994) , although corresponding levels as induced by bacterial infections have been observed in for example BRS infections (Heegard et al., 2000) .",

Similarly, Alsemgeest et al. (1994) found that S-Hp did not increase in very acute inflammatory conditions such as peracute pneumonia. In fact, they found the largest concentrations in animals with serious, often chronic inflammatory diseases. However, Eckersall et al. (2001) and Horadagoda et al. (1999) reported haptoglobin to be more affected by acute than chronic conditions. The design of the study and the detection of mild cases (unnoticed by the calf caretakers) may have contributed to the generally low sensitivities of the diagnostic tests evaluated in our study. The age distribution of disease and of S-Hp sampling, as well as the occurrence of other (infectious) diseases with an effect on S-Hp levels may alter the behaviour of the test. Eckersall et al. (2001) found S-Hp (cut-off: 0.05 mg/mL) to have a Se of 0.82 and Sp of 0.94, in differentiating between healthy cows and those with mastitis detected by dairymen. However, compared to CRD, mastitis is relatively easy for dairymen to detect and blood samples for S-Hp analysis were collected within 2-4 h of the mastitis being detected. In their analysis Eckersall et al. (2001) did not account for other factors affecting the discriminative ability of the test.",

It could for instance be used as a key figure in herd health services, animal welfare programmes, or to follow up prophylactic measures to reduce CRD problems. The usefulness of individual S-Hp sampling for herd-level diagnosis will depend on the prevalence of disease and the number of calves sampled, as well as on the age of the calves at sampling in relation to the onset of the CRD. In the present study the age at sampling coincided well with the age when the calves developed the disease. Alsemgeest (1994) reported that S-Hp in combination with other APP seemed to be a promising indicator of disease on a herd-level basis. G\u00e5nheim (2004) investigated the potential of APP (Hp, fibrinogen and serum amyloid A) as an objective tool to evaluate animal health and management in two groups of calves with different clinical health status and reported the largest difference in number of days per calf with supra-normal concentrations to occur for S-Hp, suggesting this to be the most useful APP to measure. Our results further support that S-Hp, when combined with rectal temperature may be a valuable parameter in herd-level diagnostics at least in heifers. Our data comprised only nine herds and further field studies are needed to confirm the usefulness of the test.",
