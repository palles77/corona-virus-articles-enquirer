            "text": "Many plants contain polyhydroxyalkaloids which are potent inhibitors of glucosidases, enzymes involved in oligosaccharide trimming. These are important in determining the final configuration of specific glycoproteins. Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) encodes a number of glycoproteins, some of which ultimately reside in the outer envelope of the mature virion and are important for virus infectivity. Treatment with three polyhydroxyalkaloids, castanospermine (CAST), deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) and 2R,5R-dihydroxymethyl-3R,4R-dihydroxypyrrolidine (DMDP) blocked the growth of infectious virus, as determined by yield reduction and plaque reduction assays. However, in the presence of CAST, CMV infected cells continued to shed virions into the extracellular medium, as determined by electron microscopy. Envelope glycoproteins of virions produced after treatment with CAST (2.5 mM) were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody (F5) specific for the gcI family of glycoproteins. Analysis by PAGE-SDS showed an absence of gcI complex 2 (gp52 disulphide-linked to gp130) with a proportional increase in gcI complex 1 (gp52 disulphide-linked to gp95). The results indicated that gpl30 alone, or linked to gp52, was important for CMV infectivity. As well as being potential targets for antiviral agents against CMV, inhibitors of glycoprotein trimming reactions may define components of the virion surface important for infectivity.",

The envelope glycoproteins of CMV are considered to be important in virus infectivity and are known to induce the production of antibodies that neutralise the virus in vitro (Pereira et al., 1982; Britt, 1984; Rasmussen et al., 1985) . Distinct families of glycoprotein complexes expressed on the virion envelope have been separated by ionexchange chromatography (Kari et al., 1986) and recently designated gcI, gcII and gclII with gcI comprising a major component (Gretch et al., 1988a) . Under reducing conditions, SDS-PAGE analysis showed the gcI family consisted of glycoproteins of 50--55, 93-95 and 130 kDa, respectively (Kari et al., 1986; Farrar and Greenaway, 1986; Gretch et al., 1988a,b) . In one of these studies (Farrar and Greenaway, 1986) , immunoprecipitation of purified CMV envelope glycoproteins using a monoclonal antibody with specificity for a 52 kDa glycoprotein (Law et al., 1985) revealed three disulphide cross-bridged complexes of 150 kDa (52 kDa + 95 kDa), 180 kDa (52 kDa + 130 kDa) and 250 kDa, a possible multimeric form.",

Modification of the pre-formed N-linked glycan consisting of N-acetylglucosamine 2 mannose 7-9 glucose 3 initially involves the removal of the terminal glucose residues by processing alpha-glucosidase activities before further modification through a series of hydrolytic and transferase reactions (Furhmann et al., 1985) to high mannose and complex type oligosaccharides (Fig. 1) . Certain polyhydroxyalkaloids extracted from plants are inhibitors of the glucosidase reactions (see Fig. 1 ) involved in the initial trimming of sugar residues (Saunier et al., 1982; Elbein et al., 1984; Fellows, 1986) . They are castanospermine (CAST), deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) and 2R,5R-dihydroxymethyl-3R,4R-dihydroxypyrrolidine (DMDP) derivatives of octahydroxyindolizine, piperidine or pyrrolidine, respectively (Fellows, 1986) .

            "text": "stages of glycoprotein processing but their major influence on the rest of the pathway in general allows for exploitation as selective antiviral targets. This could be possible by quantitative differences in glycosylation between host and virus encoded glycoproteins, by the nature and complexity of oligosaccharides expressed on the virion surface or by effects on post-translational events. The three glucosidase inhibitors CAST, DNJ and DMDP, shown to have activity against CMV in this study, along with a related compound methyl-DNJ, are known to inhibit the replication of mouse hepatitis virus (Repp et al., 1985) , Sindbis virus (McDowell et al., 1987) , murine (Sunkara et al., 1987) and human (Gruters et al., 1987; Tyms et al., 1987; Walker et al., 1987) retroviruses. In the case of influenza virus, treatment of infected cells with inhibitors of glucosidase activity induced structural alteration of the major surface glycoprotein (haemagglutinin) consistent with the retention of glucose residues. However, the presence of high mannose oligosaccharides on the haemagglutinin had little or no effect on virion assembly or on subsequent infectivity (Burke et al., 1984; Pan et al., 1983) . This suggested that, in this case, the sugar composition was of little importance for interaction with the host-cell receptor. In the present study, treatment with CAST did not affect the shedding of CMV but the ability of cells to make infectious virus was significantly reduced and this is likely to be so for the other alkaloids except FAG which showed little effect. The observations with CAST were accounted for by a modification of the glycoproteins expressed on the virion surface and, in particular, appeared to be related to the loss of one glycoprotein complex from the virion envelope. Efficient transport of a virion glycoprotein precursor to the surface of cells infected with mouse hepatitis virus was dependent on processing glucosidase activity and inhibition by CAST or methyl-DNJ resulted in a drop in virus yield (Repp et al., 1985) . Likewise, correct processing of oligosaccharides on a glycosylated polyprotein of murine leukaemia virus (MuLV) to the more complex type was essential for transport to the plasma membrane before cleavage into virion envelope glycoproteins (Pinter et al., 1984) . As expected, CAST or DNJ had potent effect on the replication of MuLV (Sunkara et al., 1987) . Removal of glucose residues was equally critical for proteolytic cleavage of Sindbis glycoprotein precursor pE2 for efficient virus production but modification of high mannose oligosaccharides was also important (McDowell et al., 1987) . This was of interest because most of the other viruses cited above, and HIV (Gruters et al., 1987) , were resistant to mannose processing inhibitors such as deoxymannojirimycin or swainsonine. With CMV, the loss of gp130 on virions synthesized in the presence of CAST also indicated inefficient transport or cleavage of a precursor glycoprotein. In the studies by Farrar and Greenaway (1986) a component of the gcI family of glycoproteins present on the virion surface, gp130, was complexed with gp52 (complex 2), but the present study has shown that this complex was completely replaced by gp52 disulphide-linked with gp95 (complex 1) in the absence of gp130 (see Table 1 ).",

This precursor molecule was found as a 158 kDa glycoprotein in CAST-treated cells which appeared to be due to the retention of glucose residues on the oligosaccharide sidechains.

V8 protease mapping demonstrated close similarities between gp93 and gpl30 but although their relationship to gp55 was uncertain, a common precursor for all gcI components seems likely (Gretch et al., 1988b) . One explanation of the results of the present study, consistent with the work of Gretch and his colleagues (1988b), is presented in Fig. 8 . This scheme proposes alternative pathways for the fate of the 158 kDa precursor which is influenced by the retention of the terminal glucose residues on the oligosaccharide side-chains. In the presence of CAST, neither the high mannose intermediate 138 kDa (Gretch et al., 1988) nor its proposed mature form, gpl30 (Fig. 7) was generated, hence the inability to form complex 2. In contrast, gp55 and gp93 (complex 1) were present even after treatment with CAST (Fig. 7) , and appear to be generated from the 158 kDa precursor identified by Gretch et al. (1988b) . This would mean that the oligosaccharides on gp55 and gp93 were retained in a high mannose form. This may have contributed to the reduced infectivity levels, although complex oligosaccharides may not be a requirement for the infective process as demonstrated for influenza virus (Burke et al., 1984; Pan et al., 1983) .",
