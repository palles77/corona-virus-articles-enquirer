            "text": "Infectious disease interventions like contact precautions and vaccination have proven effective in disease 7 control and elimination. The priority given to interventions can depend strongly on how virulent the pathogen 8 is, and interventions may also depend partly for their success on social processes that respond adaptively 9 to disease dynamics. However, mathematical models of competition between pathogen strains with differing 10 natural history profiles typically assume that human behaviour is fixed. Here, our objective is to model the 11 influence of social behaviour on the competition between pathogen strains with differing virulence. We couple 12 a compartmental Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model for a resident pathogen strain and a mutant strain 13 with higher virulence, with a differential equation of a population where individuals learn to adopt protective 14 behaviour from others according to the prevalence of infection of the two strains and the perceived severity of 15 the respective strains in the population. We perform invasion analysis, time series analysis and phase plane 16 analysis to show that perceived severities of pathogen strains and the efficacy of infection control against 17 them can greatly impact the invasion of more virulent strain. We demonstrate that adaptive social behaviour 18 enables invasion of the mutant strain under plausible epidemiological scenarios, even when the mutant strain 19 has a lower basic reproductive number than the resident strain. Surprisingly, in some situations, increasing 20 the perceived severity of the resident strain can facilitate invasion of the more virulent mutant strain. Our 21 results demonstrate that for certain applications, it may be necessary to include adaptive social behaviour 22 in models of the emergence of virulent pathogens, so that the models can better assist public health efforts 23 to control infectious diseases. 24 1 .

The model tracks changes in the number of individuals suscep-28 tible to an infection S(t), the number of infected individuals I(t), and (implicitly) the number of recovered 29 individuals R(t). Compartmental models such as the SIR model are useful for mechanistic modelling of 30 infection transmission in populations. They have since been further developed to study the evolution and 31 epidemiology of multiple species of pathogens in a population or different strains of the same species [2].",

            "text": "Compartmental models have also been used to study the phenomenon of pathogen virulence-the rate 38 at which a pathogen induces host mortality and/or reduces host fecundity [9, 10, 11, 12]. It was initially 39 believed that hosts and parasites co-evolved to a state of commensalism (whereby parasites benefit from 40 their host without harming them) [13, 14] but this hypothesis was later challenged [15]. In mathematical 41 models, virulence is often treated as a fixed model parameter expressing the excess mortality rate caused 42 by the pathogen. For instance, virulence has been assumed to depend on the intrinsic reproductive rate 43 of the parasite [16]. Other research expresses the transmission rate \u03b2 and the recovery rate \u00b5 in terms 44 of a parameter \u03bd that represents virulence [17]. When the impact of human behaviour is discussed in 45 such models, it is discussed in terms of hypothesized effects of human behaviour on the value of the fixed 46 parameter representing virulence. A Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) virulence model by Massad et 47 al [18] shows that reducing the number of sexual partners could possibly drive HIV to be a more benign 48 pathogen. However, the model assumes that the number of sexual partners can simply be moved up or down 49 as a model parameter, whereas in reality the number of sexual partners in a population is the outcome of 50 a dynamic socio-epidemiological process that merits its own mechanistic modelling, and itself responds to 51 pathogen virulence. In general, these models do not treat human behaviour as a dynamic variable that can 52 evolve in response to transmission dynamics and influence the evolution of virulence. (A few exceptions 53 exist, including work that allows virulence to be a function of the number of infected hosts, thus capturing a 54 situation where the magnitude of the epidemics affects the ability of health care services to host patients [19].) 55 However, as human responses to both endemic and emerging infectious diseases show, human behaviour can 56 2 .

For instance, an early and well-documented 57 example shows how the residents of the village of Eyam, England quarantined themselves to prevent the 58 spread of plague to neighbouring villages [20]. Individuals moved to less populated areas during the Spanish 59 Influenza pandemic in the early 20th century [21]. More recently, masks became widely used during the 60 outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) at the beginning of the 21st century [22], and 61 it has been shown pathogen virulence in Marek's disease can evolve in response to how vaccines are used 62 [23].",

            "text": "Theoretical models of the interactions between human behaviour and the spread of infectious diseases 64 are increasingly studied [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. For instance, Bagnoli et al [31] found that under 65 certain conditions, a disease can be driven extinct by reducing the fraction of the infected neighbours of an 66 individual. Zanette et al [32] showed that if susceptible individuals decide to break their links with infected 67 agents and reconnect at a later time, then the infection is suppressed. Gross [33] also shows that rewiring of 68 edges in a network (and thus social interaction) can greatly influence the spread of infectious diseases. Of 69 the compartmental models, we focus on those that have used concepts from evolutionary game theory such 70 as imitation dynamics [34] to describe the evolution of behaviour and its interplay with the epidemics. An 71 example of imitation dynamics concerns, as described in detail in [35], the effect of vaccination on the spread 72 of infectious diseases. Each individual in the population picks one strategy and adopts it: \"to vaccinate\" or 73 \"not to vaccinate\". The proportion of vaccinators is modelled using an ordinary differential equation and 74 is coupled with a standard SIR model. An important aspect of behavioural models is to couple them with 75 epidemiological processes such as transmission. This coupling creates a feedback loop between behaviour 76 and spread of the disease.",

Our 80 objective in this paper was to explore how behaviour and virulence influence one another, in a coupled 81 behaviour-disease differential equation model. The model allows individuals who perceive an increase in 82 the prevalence of infection to increase their usage of practices that reduce transmission rates (such as social 83 distancing and hand-washing) and thereby boost population-level immunity. This approach can help us 84 understand the effects specific social dimensions, such as level of concern for a strain or the rate of social 85 learning, on the coupled dynamics of pathogen strain emergence and human behaviour in a situation where 86 virulence imposes evolutionary trade-offs and is strain-specific.

These models use a fixed parameter 269 to quantify the number of sexual partners, but the number of sexual partners could be made to evolve 270 dynamically based on the number of infected individuals in a particular population, similar to seminal 271 work using compartmental models to model core group dynamics [42]. An increase in the number of sexual 272 partners will decrease the efficacy of infection control against the more virulent strain and effectively increase 273 its transmission and hence leads to higher virulence. Other future research could explore how adaptive 274 social behaviour interacts with evolutionary trade-offs to determine virulence evolution. One of the most 275 common hypotheses is that a trade-off exists for between-host transmission and virulence. To increase its 276 probability of transmission, the parasite must replicate within the host. This replication, on the other hand, 277 must be controlled because otherwise it might lead to the host's death and therefore prevent transmission. 278 However, other trade-offs have been suggested, such as between transmission rate and host recovery rate 279 [43]. Moreover, complicated host life cycles imply that many other types of trade-offs are also possible 280 [44], and the presence of multiple trade-offs may complicate the relationship between transmission rate and 281 virulence [45]. Social behaviour could interact with evolutionary trade-offs to alter the virulence evolution 282 of an emerging pathogen, and this process could be modelled by building on existing virulence evolution 283 models.",
