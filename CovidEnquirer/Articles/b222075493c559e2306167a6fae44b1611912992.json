The illegal trade in parrots and cockatoos poses a serious threat to the viability of native populations; in addition, species transported to non-endemic areas may potentially vector disease and genetically 'pollute' local native avifauna. To reduce the logistical difficulties associated with trafficking live birds, smugglers often transport eggs. This creates a problem for authorities in elucidating accurate species identification without the laborious task of incubation and hand rearing until a morphological identification can be made. Here, we use 99 avian eggs seized from carriers coming into and within Australia, as a result of suspected illegal trade. We investigate and evaluate the use of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to accurately identify eggs to family, genus or species level. However, Identification of a species based on percentage mtDNA similarities is difficult without good representations of the inter-and intra-levels of species variation. Based on the available reference database, we were able to identify 52% of the eggs to species level. Of those, 10 species from eight genera were detected, all of which belong to the parrot (Psittacidae) and cockatoo (Cacatuidae) families. Of the remaining 48%, a further 36% of eggs were identified to genus level, and 12% identified to family level using our assignment criteria. Clearly the lack of validated DNA reference sequences is hindering our ability to accurately assign a species identity, and accordingly, we advocate that more attention needs to be paid to establishing validated, multi locus mtDNA reference databases for exotic birds that can both assist in genetic identifications and withstand legal scrutiny.",

Many federal customs services play an active and extremely important role in the interruption of such trade at country borders. However, it is often difficult for authorities to detect all of those in possession of wildlife material owing to the sheer volume of travellers and to the fact that traffickers are skilled at concealing their cargo. It is common for illegal bird traffickers to transport eggs prior to hatching, as they are seemingly less cumbersome to transport than live animals [5] . The use of purpose-built body vests to prevent damage to the bird eggs, maintain incubation, while also aiding concealment, has been observed recently in cases of illegal trafficking into Australia (see Fig. 1 ) [5, 11] .",

            "text": "The seizure of eggs introduces one further challenge for detection authorities: correct species identification. A robust species identification is of critical importance in the success of wildlife forensic prosecutions [15] . Without the ability to identify the species of seized wildlife material, the likelihood of conviction and appropriate sentencing of traffickers may be greatly diminished [16, 17] . Correctly identifying avian species using eggshell morphology alone can be difficult. In these types of cases, genetic identification can be used as a tool when morphological features cannot be relied upon to accurately assign a species to a given wildlife sample [16] . However, this method of species identification must rely on the successful DNA extraction from eggshell or egg contents, including membrane, tissue or blood vessels where an embryo is/was present (see Fig. 1 ). Recent work has shown that DNA can be successfully extracted from eggshell membranes and from the eggshell itself, even in highly degraded samples. Trimbos et al. [18] determined that it was possible to obtain high quality DNA from eggshell membranes of the Black-tailed Godwit. The results of the study showed that in 99% of eggshell membrane samples, nuclear DNA could be successfully extracted and amplified for use in genotyping, and that the quality of the extracted DNA was comparable to that extracted from blood samples [18] . Likewise Oskam et al. [19] successfully developed a method for extracting ancient DNA from fossil eggshell $19,000 years old, illustrating the DNA in the eggshell matrix is stable for extended periods of time.",

This method of species identification relies on the existence and availability of reference sequences having been deposited on a publicly accessible database, such as GenBank [22] , to enable a close match between the known sequence and that of the query sequence. In this study, 99 bird eggs of unknown species identity were obtained from the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS) (62 eggs), and the Department of Water, Heritage and the Arts (DEWHA) (37 eggs) between 2004 and 2009. The aim of the study was to gain an insight into the target species being illegally smuggled into, or traded within, Australia.

The optimal DNA concentration, free of inhibition [24] was used for further analysis. Briefly, PCR was conducted in 25 mL reactions using ABI power SYBR master mix together with 0.8 mM of 12Sa and 12Sh primers and cycled at 95 8C Genomic DNA dilutions identified with cycle threshold (CT) values between 25 and 29 were determined to be ideal for subsequent PCR analysis.

Several factors were considered upon interpretation of the search results. Firstly, the percentage similarity between the NCBI reference and query sequence were required to be high. A threshold value of >98% was used for Cytb and 12S genes, a similar value has been employed in DNA barcoding approaches using COI [26] . Although the 98% cut-off is somewhat imprecise, such limits are required unless a detailed knowledge of the inter-specific and intra-specific variation exists for each mtDNA gene. Secondly, the number of reference sequences available for each gene (12S and Cytb) was considered, together with a determination as to whether reference sequence(s) had arisen from published work (as opposed to direct submissions to GenBank which has circumvented peer review). Thirdly, the number of available reference sequences for other closely related species was also an important consideration, because if a group (e.g. cockatoos) had been genetically well characterised, the chance of misidentifying a sample as a closely related species decreased.",

It would be difficult to argue, in a legal context, with any degree of certainty that a sample be assigned to a species without the knowledge of the genetic variability of closely related taxa. Therefore, species level identification was only assigned to those samples when more than one published reference sequence was available for at least one of the two chosen genes for this study, or alternatively, when at least one published sequence was available for both 12S and Cytb genes. We chose a sequence similarity value of >98% for both genes as a requirement for assigning species identity, but acknowledge that more research needs to occur to generate gene specific cut-off values that are appropriate to the Psittaciformes. In cases where only one species reference sequence was available on GenBank, regardless of whether the sequence similarity was >98%, species level identification was not assigned, due primarily to the effects that nuclear copies of mtDNA (numts) might have. Additionally, if the only reference sequence available was from an unpublished source, species identification was not assigned, as we believe they were not deemed fit for this purpose. Genus and family level identification was allocated when search results showed close matches (<98%) to more than one species, involving taxa that were classified within the same genus or family respectively. Our criteria, through necessity, were conservative to minimise the chance of incorrect species assignment. However, it may be likely that each genetic identification needs to be handled on a case-bycase basis and may ultimately become a judgement call based on experience, available evidence, and the quality of reference collections, which are largely the same criteria that a morphological taxonomist might use to identify species. One final complicating factor is the ever-changing nature of the taxonomic framework in which the genus, species and subspecies status of avian taxa can change in response to new data.",

Of the 37 eggs that were not autoclaved, seven extracts were found to contain an insufficient quantity of DNA to proceed with species identification. The autoclaving process deemed necessary by AQIS, while likely to cause DNA shearing was not identified as an impediment to DNA amplification, at least for mtDNA amplicons identified here. Of the 90 samples that underwent successful DNA extraction, we sequenced two mitochondrial genes (Cytb and 12S) that resulted in the identification of 47 (52%) of the samples to species level (as judged by our criteria). Of all of the samples identified to species level, one was a CITES appendix I, critically endangered Yellowcrested cockatoo (Cacatua sulphurea; Table 1 ). A total of 10 species were identified, with the majority of samples assigned to Blackcapped lory (Lorius lory) and Eclectus parrot (Eclectus roratus) ( Table 1 ) [27] [28] [29] [30] . All of our egg samples were identified to the Order Psittaciformes ('true' parrots, New Zealand parrots, and cockatoos). The family level identification comprised 12% of the successfully extracted samples to Psittacidae ('true' parrots), and Cacatuidae (cockatoos; Table 1 ). Approximately one third of egg samples (36%) could only be identified to genus level, and included the following genera: Aprosmictus, Lorius, Eos, Trichoglossus, Pyrrhura, Cacatua, and Psittaculirostris. Table 2 shows the result of a survey of the number of currently available reference sequences for Cytb, 12S, and COI mitochondrial genes that were found on GenBank at the time of this study, for selected Psittaciformes species. The percentages of the selected species that have reference sequences for these mtDNA genes on GenBank are listed. The species that were chosen in this survey are those that are popular in the international exotic pet trade [31] . The lories and lorikeets appeared to have the least coverage of available reference sequences, while the Neotropical parrots had the best sequence coverage. Of note is the fact that the COI gene, while already widely known as the 'DNA barcoding gene' [32] , is currently not well represented in GenBank (or The BOLD database) for many exotic parrot and cockatoo species, compared with other species that are often encountered in the wildlife trade.",

(2) In a comprehensive analysis of 217 mammals using Kimura 2-parameter distances, Cytb was shown to provide a greater ability than COI for separating species based on sequence data [34] . (3) . The 12S and CytB amplicons (approximately 230 bp and 500 bp respectively) were deemed a better choice than COI (amplicon of 648 bp) for samples that may have been degraded during the autoclaving process. In light of the limited coverage of reference sequences for certain Psittaciformes species on GenBank, it was decided that using two mtDNA genes, instead of just one, was more beneficial for the purpose of species identification.",

Another advantage of using two mtDNA genes for species identification is that it is possible to encounter the problem of numts, in which case, the chances of correctly identifying the species of the sample are improved with the use of multiple genes [15, 35] . In fact we recently detected a nuclear copy in GenBank for the Palm Cockatoo [36] where the published version of the CytB gene [37] is completely inconsistent with our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis. The presence of numts is at times difficult to detect, but can be investigated by translation of the sequence to identify stop codons, indels in coding sequences and variation in 3rd codon positions [35] . In our opinion the use of multiple genes also provides additional confirmation of correct species identification free of numts as similar tree topologies should be observed when the DNA is modelled.",

Secondly, that more than one mtDNA gene should be sequenced to reduce the chance of incorrect assignments due to the presence of numts. Ultimately, the ability to make accurate species assignments based on mtDNA sequences is underpinned by the coverage and quality of DNA reference databases, together with the accuracy of the taxonomic framework. Without a comprehensive knowledge of intra-and inter-species variation for the mtDNA loci used for species identification, regardless of percentage sequence similarity, there still may be doubt as to the accuracy of taxonomic assignments [39] . Importantly, if mtDNA sequence data are to be used in a legal context it is vital that reference sequences are fit for purpose and have passed the scrutiny of peer review. The use of 'unpublished data', or sequences without taxonomic provenance could compromise the fidelity of DNA based species identifications. The peer-review process, while it may not always ensure data fidelity, is still widely regarded as the best available test of scientific rigour and has long been used to establish the credentials of expert witnesses. The alternative is to instigate an auditing procedure to verify both the specimen and the sequence data that it is derived from, in the same way that COI DNA sequence data is scrutinised prior to addition to BOLD [30] . This task does, however, require considerable resources. Clearly there is a need for a diverse and highly reliable DNA reference database to use in species identity testing for wildlife forensic casework. An ideal DNA reference database should contain reference sequences that have been identified based on a solid taxonomic framework, and not where doubt still surrounds a species identity with that of closely related taxa [40] . Such a database should have a large number of individuals for each species and be available for more than one mtDNA gene so that a true indication of intra-specific variation can be assessed. As clearly highlighted in Table 1 , there is an obvious deficiency of reference sequences in which all three mtDNA genes (12S, Cytb and COI) are present, both in GenBank and in BOLD for the highly sought after avian species involved in the illegal trade. This disconcerting lack of reference samples for many parrot and cockatoo species may be in part due to the fact that Psittaciformes comprise approximately 359 species [29] compared with other fauna of forensic importance, such as elephant (in regard to the ivory trade), of which there are only a small number of species [41, 42] . This in itself presents a challenging task of sourcing adequate reference material, with provenance, for each species to build a comprehensive and robust DNA database in which to facilitate the process of DNA species identification. Difficulties in sourcing new reference material can cause substantial delays to the development of reference sequence data as, somewhat ironically, our laboratory routinely struggles to obtain reference samples (e.g. feathers or DNA) from overseas as CITES legislation does not allow the movement of body parts or derivatives without extensive documentation. Nevertheless, the task of compiling a 'fit for purpose' database should be systematically approached where prioritising commonly poached and traded species should be the logical first step. Utilisation of pre-existing sequence data that has already been satisfactorily audited, as in BOLD, could be used in conjunction with new DNA sequence data that is yet to be generated, for other mitochondrial genes.",

Recently a study was undertaken to survey the bird markets of Indonesia over a 5-year period [31] . It was found that much of the trade was conducted illegally, yet was carried out in open markets with the perception that the risk of being charged was minimal, despite there being legislation in place that prohibits this trade. Interestingly, the list of surveyed parrot and cockatoo species seen in the market included many of the same species identified in this study (Table 1) , including the critically endangered Yellowcrested cockatoo [31] . With surveys such as this, information gained on which species are being targeted could be used to prioritise the acquisition of reference material for the development of a DNA database, which could be utilised by wildlife forensic and conservation biologists with the aim of conserving avian species and more effectively prosecuting individuals involved in illegal wildlife trafficking.",

It is apparent that species identity testing from eggs using mtDNA is a valuable tool and it is clear from the data presented here that caution needs to be exercised when making species identifications based solely on one mitochondrial locus. A focus on establishing DNA reference databases for the most commonly traded wildlife species will assist in forensic casework. The ability for DNA (mtDNA, SNP's and microsatellites) to assist in species identification and population assignment (as is currently practiced in monitoring the ivory trade) will not only help to prosecute wildlife traffickers, but may also help in the conservation of threatened and endangered species. We advocate that there is an urgent need to establish validated international databases for avian species of the parrot and cockatoo families, which are becoming increasingly threatened by illegal removal from the wild and by habitat destruction.",
