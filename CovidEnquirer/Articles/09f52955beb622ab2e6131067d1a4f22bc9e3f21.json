The advantages of our representations are that (i) these 3D curves are strictly non-degenerate and there is no loss of information when transferring a DNA sequence to its mathematical representation and (ii) the coordinates of every node on these 3D curves have clear biological implication. Two applications of these 3D curves are presented: (a) a simple formula is derived to calculate the content of the four bases (A, G, C and T) from the coordinates of nodes on the curves; and (b) a 12-component characteristic vector is constructed to compare similarity among DNA sequences from different species based on the geometrical centers of the 3D curves. As examples, we examine similarity among the coding sequences of the first exon of betaglobin gene from eleven species and validate similarity of cDNA sequences of beta-globin gene from eight species.",

However, it has been acknowledged that information contained in DNA sequences is difficult for humans to comprehend without careful extraction and processing. Many methods have been proposed to characterize DNA sequences, with special efforts given to representing the sequence graphically. Using graphical approaches to study biological problems can provide an intuitive picture or useful insights for helping analyzing complicated relations in these systems, as demonstrated by many previous studies on a series of important biological topics, such as analysis of codon usage (Chou and Zhang, 1992; Chou, 1993, 1994) , base frequencies in the anti-sense strands (Chou et al., 1996) , analysis of DNA and protein sequence (Qi et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2009) , enzyme-catalyzed reactions (Andraos, 2008; Chou, 1980 Chou, , 1981 Chou, , 1989 Chou et al., 1979; Chou and Forsen, 1980; Chou and Liu, 1981; Lin and Neet, 1990; Zhou and Deng, 1984) , protein folding kinetics and folding rates (Chou, 1990; Chou and Shen, 2009; Shen et al., 2009) , inhibition kinetics of processive nucleic acid polymerases and nucleases , and drug metabolism systems (Chou, 2010) . Moreover, graphical methods have also been introduced to deal with some other biological and medical related problems (Diao et al., 2007; Gonzalez-Diaz et al., 2009; Munteanu et al., 2009) . Recently, the images of cellular (Wolfram, 1984 (Wolfram, , 2002 automata were also used to represent biological sequences (Xiao et al., 2005a) for predicting protein structural classes (Xiao et al., 2008) and subcellular location (Xiao et al., 2006b) , identifying G-protein-coupled receptor functional classes (Xiao et al., 2009 ), investigating HBV virus gene missense mutation (Xiao et al., 2005b) , HBV viral infections (Xiao et al., 2006a) , as well as analyzing SARS-cov (Gao et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2005) .",

            "text": "Graphical representation of DNA sequences was first proposed by Hamori and Ruskin (1983) . Gates (1986) , Nandy (1994) and Leong and Morgenthaler (1995) developed 2D graphical representations of DNA sequences. These methods are straightforward but are accompanied with some loss of information due to overlapping and crossing of the curve representing DNA with itself and degeneracy generated by the circuit. Randic et al. (2003) developed a novel 2D representation method in which there is no loss of information in transferring a DNA sequence to its mathematical representation. More recently, several other 2D representations have been proposed (Wang and Zhang, 2006; Zhang, 2009; Yao et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2010) . As for the 3D graphical representation, Hamori and Ruskin (1983) developed the H-curve. It can uniquely represent a DNA sequence. Based on the classifications of DNA bases, Zhang, 1997; Zhang et al., 2003) created the Z-curve to represent DNA sequences, in which the four bases (A, G, T and C) are represented by the four vertexes of the regular tetrahedron, as A(1,1,1), T(-1,-1,1), C(-1,1,-1) and G(1,-1,-1). The Z-curve is a 3D graphical representation and it has clear biological implication. However, as pointed out by Tang et al. (2010) , the Z-curve representation has a defeat that it might cause a loop in the resulting spatial curve if the frequencies of the four bases present in the sequence are the same. Randic et al. (2000) presented another 3D graphical representation method, but the limitation in forms of crossing and overlapping of the spatial curve representing a DNA sequence still remains. Recently, more other 3D representations were developed by several authors (Li and Wang, 2004; Liao and Wang, 2004; Yu et al., 2009) to overcome the problem of degeneration in graphical representation. These methods, however, do not seem to possess apparent biological meanings.",

This method has been proved to be useful and used by many authors (Randic et al., 2000 (Randic et al., , 2003 Wang and Zhang, 2006; Li and Wang, 2004) . However, when DNA sequence is very long, these matrices can become very large, and the calculation could become very complicated. Yao et al. (2005) used the coordinates of the geometric center of graph as the sequence descriptors to do similarity analysis among different DNA sequences. The method is simple as far as calculation is concerned. However, it does have a potentially serious drawback: when the two DNA sequences under comparison contain the same proportions of the bases A, G, T and C, they may have the same geometric center, although they can be completely different. To overcome this unfavorable drawback, we develop a new method for comparing similarity between two DNA sequences based on our proposed RY-curve, MK-curve and SW-curve. A twelve-component vector that serves as a sequence descriptor is constructed based on the geometrical centers of the representing curves.",

            "text": "In this paper, we propose three graphical representations, namely RY-curve, MK-curve and SW-curve, to represent the DNA sequence in a 3D space. We prove that the 3D curves are strictly non-degenerate and there is no loss of information in transferring the DNA sequence to the proposed curves. Compared with other graphical representations, the main advantage of our method is Table 3 The similarity matrix of the 11 coding sequences of that the 2D projection of RY-curve, MK-curve and SW-curve onto the x-y plane and the x-z plane has clear biological implication. For example, the 2D projection of RY-curve onto the x-y plane denotes the changing trend of the content of A, G (see Fig. 4 ). The three components of the terminal node of these 3D curves algebraically relate to the content of the bases: A, G, T and C (see Properties 3.3 and 3.4). Therefore, more information is retained by our method compared to other available methods. As the application of the graphical representation, we derive a simple formula to recover the content of the four kinds of bases (A, G, C and T) in a DNA sequence from the proposed curves. The sequence descriptors of 12-component vectors we have constructed enabled us to conduct similarity analysis among the coding sequences of first exon of beta-globin gene of 11 species. Our results are in overall agreement with the results reported in the article (Zhang, 2009; Yao et al., 2008; Tang et al., 2010; Liao and Ding, 2006; Liu et al., 2006 ) (see Table 4 ). We also have a good validation of similarities of cDNA sequences of the related ones by our method. Computation involved in implementing the proposed methods is fairly straightforward.
