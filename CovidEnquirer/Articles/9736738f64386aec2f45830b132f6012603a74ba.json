The Norwegian control program against these infections is based on herd-level diagnosis using a new multiplex immunoassay. The objective of this study was to estimate sensitivity and specificity across different cut-off values for the MVD-Enferplex BCV/BRSV multiplex, by comparing them to a commercially available ELISA, the SVANOVIR \u00ae BCV-Ab and SVANOVIR \u00ae BRSV-Ab, respectively. We analyzed bulk tank milk samples from 360 herds in a low-and 360 herds in a high-prevalence area. As none of the tests were considered perfect, estimation of test characteristics was performed using Bayesian latent class models. At the manufacturers' recommended cut-off values, the median sensitivity for the BRSV multiplex and the BRSV ELISA was 94.4 [89.8-98.7 95% Posterior Credibility Interval (PCI)] and 99.8 [98.7-100 95% PCI], respectively. The median specificity for the BRSV multiplex was 90.6 [85.5-94.4 95% PCI], but only 57.4 [50.5-64.4 95% PCI] for the BRSV ELISA. However, increasing the cut-off of the BRSV ELISA increased specificity without compromising sensitivity. For the BCV multiplex we found that by using only one of the three antigens included in the test, the specificity increased, without concurrent loss in sensitivity. At the recommended cut-off this resulted in a sensitivity of 99.9 [99.3-100 95% PCI] and specificity of 93.7 [88.8-97.8 95% PCI] for the multiplex and a sensitivity of 99.5 [98.1-100 95% PCI] and a specificity of 99.6 [97.6-100 95% PCI] for the BCV ELISA. .no (I.

BCV causes respiratory disease, calf diarrhea and winter dysentery (contagious diarrhea in adult cattle) (Boileau and Kapil, 2010) . BRSV causes respiratory disease mostly in young animals but can affect animals of all ages, and is a common cause of respiratory outbreaks in Norway (Larsen, 2000; Klem et al., 2014a) . Consequences of these infections are herd health problems, reduced animal welfare and increased use of antibiotics due to secondary bacterial infections (Larsen, 2000; Valarcher and Taylor, 2007; Boileau and Kapil, 2010) .

This prompted the need for an easy and cost-effective way to screen dairy herds for a herd level diagnosis for BRSV and BCV. The initial screening in the control program was conducted using bulk tank milk samples (BTM). There are already commercially available indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) widely used in routine diagnostics and research in the Nordic countries (SVANOVIR \u00ae BRSV-Ab and SVANOVIR \u00ae BCV-Ab) (Tr\u00e5v\u00e9n et al., 1999; Klem et al., T 2014b; Toftaker et al., 2016) .

The true antibody status of each test subject can be determined in two ways: By use of a perfect reference test, or based on populations with known status. However, a perfect reference test (often termed a \"gold standard\") is rarely available and for endemic diseases, which is the case for BRSV and BCV in Norway, no reference population with complete certainty regarding disease or disease freedom exists. Consequently, the underlying true infection status for test subjects remains unknown. Test validation studies (erroneously) assuming perfect reference tests are common, even though this has been shown to introduce bias in the estimation of accuracy parameters (Valenstein, 1990; Lijmer et al., 1999) . Latent class analysis (LCA) allows for the estimation of test parameters in populations where the underlying true infection status cannot be determined (Hui and Walter, 1980) . In LCA the true infection status is treated as an existing, but unknown (latent), variable and test accuracy and prevalence are parameterized according to this latent variable.",

Briefly, the antigens were deposited in a multiplex planar array as individual spots into wells of 96 well microtiter plates to produce arrays of antigens. Samples were diluted 1:3 into sample dilution buffer and mixed before added to the well and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 60 min with agitation. After washing procedures, the detection antibody diluted in conjugate buffer was added and plates were incubated (37\u00b0C for 60 min with agitation) before new washing.

Relative light units (RLU) were captured (45 s exposure) immediately, using Quansys biosciences imaging system, and data was extracted using Quansys Q view software (v 1.5.4.7). Antigens were combined in a parallel reading, i.e. the test was considered positive when the RLU-value of at least one antigen was above the applied cut-off.

The underlying latent state could be considered as previous exposure, leading to antibodies in BTM. The use of LCA methodology for diagnostic test evaluation requires a set of assumptions of the tests and test populations to be fulfilled. (1) two or more populations with different prevalence are included, (2) the Se and Sp of the diagnostic tests are the same across the populations, and (3) the tests are conditionally independent (CID) given disease status (Hui and Walter, 1980) . We ran the analyses assuming CID between tests; however, we also explored the consequences of relaxing this assumption as explained below. For the CID-models, parameters were estimated for several cut-off values (Fig. 1 ). Models were fit using Bayesian LCA in the OpenBugs version 3.2.1 rev 781 software. We used non-informative priors in the shape of uniform distributions on the interval between zero and one, modelled using the beta (1, 1) distribution for test properties and sub-population prevalence in all analyses. Models were run with 20,000 iterations, of which 10,000 were used as burn in and discarded. Convergence of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains were assessed by visual inspection of history plots, time-series plots and Gelman-Rubin diagnostic plots using three sample chains with different initial values, as suggested by Toft et al. (2007) . Posterior inference was done by calculating medians and 95% posterior credibility intervals (PCI) for Se, Sp and true prevalence. The model description is included in Appendix A.",

The Sp of the ELISA increased to 99.4 (Se 93.4) when a cut-off of sample positive > 50 PP was used. For the multiplex, increasing the cut-off value for the BRSV-A antigen generally resulted in lower Se and higher Sp estimates as could be expected. Discarding all antigens except the BRSV-A resulted in increased specificity, however, with the cost of significantly reduced sensitivity, as can be seen from comparing cut-off alternative 2 and 7 in Table 3 . Point estimates (median) of true BRSV antibody prevalence ranged from 84.5 to 87.3 for pop 1, and from 25.2 to 30.5 for pop 2. Results from the COC-models with fixed covariance, showed that allowing for covariance altered specificity estimates for both the ELISA and the multiplex. The change was small for a covariance of 0.25 or less of the maximum possible covariance. The Se estimates were not noticeably affected by allowing for covariance.

This is the first study evaluating the MVD-Enferplex BRSV/BCV multiplex. The present study is also the first to present test parameters for the SVANOVIR \u00ae BRSV-Ab and SVANOVIR \u00ae BCV-Ab on BTM. The BRSV multiplex showed a somewhat lower Se, but a much higher Sp than the BRSV ELISA at the recommended cut-off values. However, when we increased the cut-off of the BRSV ELISA to sample positive > 50 PP, this resulted in a large increase in Sp without a notable decrease in Se, as shown in Table 3 . Our results therefore suggest that a higher cut-off than recommended by the manufacturer might be appropriate when using the SVANOVIR \u00ae BRSV-Ab on BTM. For BCV, the specificity of the multiplex was notably lower than the BCV ELISA at the recommended cut-off when using all three antigens. However, when using the BCV-A antigen only, the Sp improved without the cost of reduced Se, and the test performance was then similar to the BCV ELISA. This implies that the extra antigens are adding false positive samples, hence reducing Sp. Overall; the two tests in this study both showed good performance for detection of both BRSV and BCV antibodies. A possible benefit of choosing the multiplex therefore lies in enabling screening for both agents simultaneously as this will reduce screening costs. As the multiplex evaluated in the present study is a new Table 2 Counts of paired test outcomes in the two sub-populations for the BCV-antibody tests (BCV multiplex/BCV ELISA). For the BCV multiplex varying cut-off values for the included antigens were used (shown in Fig. 1) . The BCV ELISA cut-off was fixed at sample positive > 10 PP.

The BRSV ELISA cut-off was fixed at sample positive > 10 PP for all alternatives except for alternative 9, where the BRSV ELISA cut-off was increased to sample positive > 50 PP. test, there were no relevant studies we could compare estimates to. However, the multiplex technology has been shown useful for bovine tuberculosis in cattle and goats (Clegg et al., 2011; O'Brien et al., 2017) . The parameter estimates provided by the manufacturer for the SVAN-OVIR \u00ae BCV-Ab are based on data from a study in which 91 serum samples were analyzed using both the ELISA and a virus neutralization test (VNT) (Alenius et al., 1991) . The estimates, Se of 84.6% and Sp of 100%, were calculated using VNT as gold standard. For the SVANOVIR \u00ae BRSV-Ab, the Se (94%) and Sp (100%) were calculated in a study comparing the test results to another ELISA in 151 serum samples. Thus, test estimates were relative to the other ELISA (Elvander et al., 1995) . Results from the former studies are not comparable to the present study due to different sample material (serum vs. BTM). Even so, it is important to note that in studies assuming a perfect reference test the estimated Se and Sp of the index test will never exceed those of the gold standard, thus the higher Se of both the BRSV and BCV ELISA found in our study was not unexpected. To explore the effect of different cut-off values on test characteristics we applied a range of cut-off values for the multiplex antigens. Whenever the cut-off is changed this could entail a change in the definition of the latent condition and change the number of true positive and true negative herds. There was relatively little variation in the Se and Sp estimates of the BRSV-and BCV ELISA across the different cutoff values explored, and the change in estimates of true prevalence was minor. The tests generally agreed on the proportion of positive herds indicating that tests had good agreement on the underlying target condition. The explorative approach to choosing cut-offs is a potential weakness of the current study; however, the different scenarios provide examples of expected performance for different cut-offs and do not represent an optimization of the diagnostic tests. The chosen cut-off will Table 4 Results from the sensitivity analysis (BRSV): Median estimates and 95% posterior credibility intervals (PCI) of the sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of bulk tank milk BRSV multiplex and BRSV ELISA at the manufacturers' recommended cut-off (alternative 2, Fig. 1 ), for the conditionally independent (CID) model and conditionally dependent (COC) models where the covariance is expressed as proportions of maximum possible value.

Findings of antigenic diversity of BCV are summarized by Saif (2010) who concludes that only a single serotype is known based on virus cross-neutralization tests, and that a high level of cross protection has been shown between respiratory and enteric isolates. For BRSV, a Norwegian study found that the current Norwegian strains of BRSV belonged to the same subgroup as other North European isolates, indicating that the within-country diversity is likely to be limited (Klem et al., 2014a) . Additionally, cross-reaction is likely to be common, and has even been shown for isolates from different species (Oberst et al., 1993) .

            "text": "The final assumption to be met is conditional independence of tests given the disease status. Several papers argue that if tests have similar biological basis, this assumption is likely not met Branscum et al., 2005) . Conditional independence between tests means that the probability of a positive (or negative) result from one test is the same regardless of the result of the other test, given the true disease state (En\u00f8e et al., 2000; Toft et al., 2005) . Conditional dependence would, in terms of false positives, mean that the second test is more likely to pick up a herd as a false positive if it already tested (false) positive on the first test, for instance due to cross-reactivity with other agents. To estimate covariance between tests (\u03b3 Se and \u03b3 Sp ) two extra degrees of freedom are needed. In a two tests, two populations scenario this results in an unidentifiable model i.e. it is not possible to estimate covariance without including prior information. No reliable prior information could be obtained for test parameters or prevalences in the present study. Another approach potentially allowing for estimation of covariance would be to include a third test: either another antibody test, or a test detecting the virus itself (e.g. a qPCR). The first option would not necessarily allow for estimation of covariance unless the third test had some underlying properties substantially different from the two other tests. Adding an antigen test might ensure conditional independence, however, it would change the underlying disease status to involve not only serological response, but also a coherent shedding of virus. We explored the consequences of conditional dependence (sensitivity analysis) by including fixed covariances as proportions of the maximum possible covariance between tests. For the BCV estimates, allowing for covariance in the latent class models had negligible effect on parameter estimates of both tests. As the Se of the BCV multiplex and the Sp of the BCV ELISA is close to one, the small effect of covariance was expected. It can be shown mathematically that test Se (Sp) are conditionally independent whenever one test has Se (Sp) = 1, see Appendix A for details. This was also the situation for BRSV-Se where the Se of the ELISA is close to 1. However, the COC-models with fixed covariances did yield changes in the estimated specificity for BRSV of both tests. This became most notable when the covariance was assumed larger than 25% of maximum. In summary, the effect of covariance was small except for BRSV-Sp for high values of covariance. It is important to note that the sensitivity analysis gives an indication of the effect of covariance if present, but does not answer whether covariance exists. Even though both tests in this study are antibody tests, they differ in the way they are designed. First, the ELISAs uses crude whole virus in the ELISA well, whereas the BRSV/BCV multiplex uses peptides and recombinant proteins. Second, the tests use different techniques for detection. The ELISAs use a chromogenic substrate and results are based on a reading of optical density, whereas the BRSV/BCV multiplex uses a chemiluminescent substrate where results are based on a reading of light emission. These differences make a violation of the conditional independence assumption less likely.",
