            "text": "Following the recent use of a live vaccine against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in Denmark, both American (vaccine) and European-type PRRSV now coexist in Danish herds. This situation highlighted a requirement for supplementary tests for precise virustyping. As a result, we developed a RT-PCR assay able to detect as well as type PRRSV. To provide maximal sequence information, complete viral open reading frames (ORFs 5 and 7) were targeted for amplification. The RT-PCR test was able to amplify complete PRRSV ORFs from complex materials such as boar semen containing as little as 1 TCID 50 ml \u00c01 of PRRSV. Typing of viruses was accomplished by any one of three strategies: (i) use of type-specific PCR primers, (ii) size determination of ORF 7 amplicons, (iii) DNA sequencing. All three typing strategies showed complete concordance with the currently used method of typing with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) when used on a panel of PRRSV field isolates covering the period 1992\u00b11997. The ORF 7based test had particularly desirable characteristics, namely, highly sensitive detection of PRRSV without apparent type bias, typing of the detected virus, discrimination between pure and mixed virus populations, and semi-quantitative assessment of type ratios in mixed populations, all in a single PCR reaction. In addition, the obtained sequence data were used to predict two simple and rapid strategies (single-enzyme restriction length polymorphy analysis and oligonucleotide hybridization) for confirmation of the specificity of ORF 7 RT-PCR reactions. As such, the RT-PCR assay provides a new, powerful diagnostic tool to study the population dynamics between present and emerging PRRSV-types. # 0378-1135/98/$ \u00b1 see front matter # 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

The emergence of an apparently pathogenic, hitherto unrecognized PRRSV-type in Denmark increased the demand for accurate typing of virus isolates. Isolation of PRRSV on cell cultures and typing with MAbs offer a combination of sturdiness, sensitivity and accuracy that, in our opinion, is unlikely to be greatly improved upon. However, in selected diagnostic cases, as well as in many research situations, the sensitivity and accurate typing afforded by RT-PCR techniques would be highly desirable. Also, cell culture methods may not be well suited to examine seminal shedding of PRRSV, due to a high content of cytotoxic compounds in this material.",

Yet, the value of the test would be greatly enhanced if ORF 7 PCR could also distinguish between infection with a single PRRSV-type, and concomitant infection in the same animal with US-and EU-types. The use of size polymorphy in an ORF 7 amplicon to type PRRSV viruses was first described by Mardassi et al., but these authors did not investigate the applicability of the technique to double infection. The results in Fig. 4 shows that ORF 7 PCR in fact correctly identified mixed-infection situations by displaying both size variants of the ORF 7 amplicon (compare lanes 2, 4 and 6). In the experiment shown in Fig. 4 , 3% of a minority-type was detected in a mixed population (see Lanes 3 and 5. The US-type band in Lane 3 was clearly visible on the original photo). Further experiments indicated that a Fig. 4 . Examination of mixed-type PRRSV populations by ORF 7 PCR. Reference viruses VR2332 (Americantype) and 111/92 (European-type) were mixed in different ratios (based on TCID 50 ), but maintaining a constant PRRSV concentration of 100 TCID 50 ml \u00c01 (thus ensuring that even a 3% minority-type would be above the detection sensitivity of the RT-PCR), and the mixed populations were analyzed by ORF 7 RT-PCR.

Lane 6, US-type virus only. 1 : 100 ratio between viruses (measured in TCID 50 ) resulted in the simultaneous appearance of both size variants of the ORF 7 amplicon, whereas a 1 : 1.000 ratio between viruses lay below the resolving ability of the ORF 7 PCR. Importantly, judged by eye, the ratio between viruses was reflected in relative intensities of ORF 7 bands (compare Lanes 3, 4 and 5). The difference in intensities of ORF 7 bands from the minor virus population in Lanes 3 (very faint band from 3% US-type PRRSV) and 5 (somewhat stronger band from 3% EU-type PRRSV) most likely reflected the uncertainty in titrating stock viruses, which would be expected to figure very prominently in this type of analysis.

This situation requires that diagnostic tests be able to detect as well as precisely type the PRRSV virus. Virus isolation on PPAM and MARC monolayers is currently the gold standard of virus detection; yet, some PRRSV-containing materials (such as semen) contain too high levels of cytotoxic compounds to be reliably screened by tissue culture methods (Christopher-Hennings et al., 1995b; Nielsen et al., 1997; Shin et al., 1997) . Typing PRRSV isolates with EU-type specific and US-type-specific MAbs is a rapid and accurate method; however, finer sub-typing of virus is not currently possible with this method, excluding detailed epidemiological studies. Although a number of RT-PCR tests for PRRSV have been published by others, the current situation in Denmark (co-existence of European and American-type PRRSV) poses unique requirements, particularly for precise differentiation of European, wildtype-American and vaccine-American PRRSV.

Thus, RT-PCR detection is mainly expected to be advantageous on material where culture is considered difficult, such as boar semen. It should be mentioned that since clinical material such as serum and lung homogenate contain up to 1000 TCID 50 ml \u00c01 during the peak of viral replication at 10\u00b114 days post-infection, the RT-PCR test is expected to have up to a 100-fold excess of sensitivity for direct detection of PRRSV in the tissues of infected pigs, without any need for nested PCR. These calculations were supported by preliminary semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis: sera, lung homogenates and semen from PRRSV-infected pigs at 10\u00b114 days post-infection could be diluted 10\u00b1100-fold, and still be detected positive by ORF 7 RT-PCR. Furthermore, our ORF 7 RT-PCR detected PRRSV nucleic acid in the semen of experimentally infected boars from 4 to 42 days post-infection, without need for nested PCR (results not shown). Further experiments are planned to examine the duration and quantity of PRRSV excretion in boar semen.",

Although primers (Table 1) were chosen in what appeared to be conserved regions by sequence analysis, experimental confirmation of this seemed important, because of the pronounced genetic heterogeneity between PRRSV isolates. When applied to a panel of 52 PRRSV field isolates from the period 1991\u00b11997, the test in fact correctly detected PRRSV in all the samples (Table 2) . Thus, primer-binding sites did not significantly change over a 6-year period, and, by inference, the risk of PRRSV evolution interfering with detection in our test would appear to be small.",

Experimental data (Fig. 3) suggest that the ORF 7 PCR exhibits equal sensitivity for European-and American-types, making it a highly suited test for estimating type prevalence. Theoretical considerations strongly support that ORF 7 PCR should exhibit bias-less detection: detection of all types is accomplished by the same RT-PCR primers, and the ORF 7 amplicons from EU-and US-types exhibit similar GC content and only a slight (4%) size difference, suggesting similar amplification efficiencies in RT-PCR. For the two ORF 5 PCR, the situation was more complex: since both ORF 5 PCR detected the cognate virus-type at 10 TCID 50 ml \u00c01 , we conclude that no type-bias existed at virus concentrations well below those normally found in clinical material. However, we cannot exclude that detection with ORF 5 PCR may be biased at extremely low virus concentrations.",

Sequencing is cumbersome, but allows unrivalled precision in typing, with sub-typing of PRRSV even within the main categories of`European' and American' being possible. On the other hand, use of type-specific primers or size determination of ORF 7 amplicons are rapid methods, that offer broad classification of virus as`European' or`American' only. Together, the flexibility of the described RT-PCR assay should thus cover most diagnostic eventualities.",

Although the test was optimized to avoid unspecific bands, and did not show cross-reactivity to a number of relevant viruses (see Section 2), it can be anticipated that additional examination of the specificity of an amplicon may be required. For this purpose, RFLP analysis offers a very simple and attractive alternative to the more impractical techniques of sequencing, Southern blotting or nested PCR. In fact, the relatively large amplicon size in our test (637\u00b1818 bp) provides an ideal target for RFLP. For example, analysis of our own as well as GeneBank ORF 7 sequences (total of 61 European-and 19 American-type) predicts that the digestion of the ORF 7 amplicon produced in our test with a single, inexpensive restriction enzyme (HaeII), could provide discrimination between US-(215 and 445 nt fragments) and EU-types (299 and 338 nt fragments). Also, the ORF 7 sequence data indicated that a 29 mer oligonucleotide (5 H AT GGC CAG CCA GTC AAT CA A/G CTG TGC AAG 3 H ) would hybridize to an internal, highly conserved sequence in ORF 7 amplicons from EU as well as US viruses. Preliminary experiments indicate that using an alkaline phosphatase-labelled form of this oligo in a rapid dot-blot assay is highly useful for enhancing both specificity and sensitivity of the ORF 7 RT-PCR.",

Insight into these problems will require the study of animals naturally or experimentally co-infected with both PRRSV-types.

Isolates from other European countries were sent out under the EU concerted action on PRRSV programme.Isolates were typed by reactivity of infected cell monolayers with MAbs VO17 (specific for American-type PRRSV) and WBE 4 (specific for European-type PRRSV).RT-PCR test result was determined by absence (negative result, indicated by`\u00c0' in the table) or presence (positive result, indicated by`' in the table) of bands of the expected size following agarose gel electrophoresis. Identity of bands was confirmed by excision from agarose gels and subsequent DNA sequencing for all data shown in the table. Negative controls (uninfected PPAM and MARC cells, as well as serum, semen and lung homogenate from uninfected animals) were negative in RT-PCR.",
