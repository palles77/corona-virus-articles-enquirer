            "text": "Encephalitozoon cuniculi is a spore-forming obligate intracellular parasite belonging to the phylum Microspora (Wasson and Peper, 2000) . The criterion for inclusion in this phylum is possession of a 'polar filament', which extrudes as the spore germinates and is thought to help gain entry into host cells. There are several Encephalitozoon species (e.g., Encephalitozoon intestinalis, Encephalitozoon hellem, Encephalitozoon bieneusi, Encephalitozoon septata) most of which are opportunist pathogens in immunocompromised human hosts. Diarrhoea, renal disease and keratoconjunctivitis are among the diseases that have been associated with encephalitozoonosis in humans. In animals, E. cuniculi is the most important member of the order Microsporidia. Encephalitozoon cuniculi primarily affects rabbits but can be found in other species. Microsporidia are unusual in that they lack mitochondria, presumably gaining their nutrition from the host cells (Pakes and Gerrity, 1994) . They are characterized by a firm capsule that is strongly Gramnegative (Owen, 1992) . A long polar filament is neatly coiled within it. The spore has a polar cap. Infection of the host usually occurs by oral ingestion of food contaminated with infected urine. Once in the alimentary tract, the spore comes in close contact with the mucosa and infects a host cell by extruding the polar filament. Sporoplasm is transferred through the polar filament into a vacuole in the host cell where multiplication takes place. Dividing organisms are lined up along the vacuolar membrane that is thought to be of host origin (Pakes and Gerrity, 1994) .",

Spores then enter host cells within the gastrointestinal or respiratory system, targeting reticuloendothelial cells in particular. It is unclear whether this is solely by extrusion of the polar tube or if phagocytosis also plays a role. The cells of the reticuloendothelial system are among those invaded and they distribute the parasite around the body. Eventually the organisms develop into mature spores that are oval in shape and measure approximately 2.5 \u00c2 1.5 mm with a thick cell wall (Pakes and Gerrity, 1994) . The vacuole becomes distended and the cell eventually ruptures, releasing spores that invade new cells. Rupture of the cells is associated with an inflammatory response (Pattison et al., 1971) .",

Once suitable host cells are penetrated, the parasite proliferates (merogony) and differentiates and matures (sporogony), causing eventual rupture of the host cell and release of spores to complete the life cycle. It is postulated that the rupture of host cells and release of foreign material initiates the granulomatous response commonly associated with this disease. This is why histopathological examination frequently fails to find evidence of organisms within the granulomatous lesions. Chronic granulomatous inflammation in these organs is thought to be responsible for the clinical signs attributed to E. cuniculi. The clinical signs commonly believed to be a result of encephalitozoonosis may be grouped into three broad categories: signs of central nervous disease, signs of renal disease and those of ocular disease. Chronic inflammation results in the development of granulomatous lesions in target organs, primarily the kidney and brain, although the liver may be involved (see Figure 10 .6 and Figure 14 .5). Myocarditis has also been reported (Pakes and Gerrity, 1994) . Clinical signs are associated with granulomatous encephalitis or nephritis, notably vestibular disease and chronic renal failure. Encephalitozoon cuniculi can also cause lens rupture, pyogranulomatous uveitis and cataracts in rabbits (see Section 9.7.3.1 and Figure 9 .4). In utero infection of the lens in the developing embryo occurs and causes the lens to rupture in later life (Stiles et al., 1997) .",

Only after Textbook of Rabbit Medicine 63-70 days are the organisms shown to be present and causing lesions in the brain, though compared to the lesions seen in the kidney at this stage, these are relatively mild. From this timeline it is apparent that it is possible to have a positive titre to E. cuniculi before the organism is likely to have entered the central nervous system. Any rabbit showing central nervous signs at this time could be wrongly supposed to be showing clinical signs due to this disease. The ability to differentiate IgM and IgG titres may clarify this situation. IgM titres increase early in the course of an infection, then fall, and are absent after day 38. IgG rises more slowly but remains measurable for years (Kunstyr et al., 1986 , Sobottka et al., 2001 .",

            "text": "In addition to rabbits, E. cuniculi can cause severe disease in blue (Arctic) foxes, Alopex lagopus, and financial losses to the fur industry. This disease has therefore been extensively studied in this species. Adult blue foxes are asymptomatic carriers but can pass on infection transplacentally and the resultant puppies can have various clinical signs, depending on what body system is primarily involved. These range from acute renal failure to cardiac signs to widespread non-suppurative meningoencephalitis. Akerstedt (2003) demonstrated the humoral response of adult blue foxes in Norway persists for at least one year. Disease in blue foxes has prompted serological surveys of farmed Arctic foxes in Finland (Akerstedt et al., 2002) , wild Arctic foxes in Greenland (Akerstedt and Kapel, 2003) and other species of fox, Dusicyon culpaeus and Dusicyon griseus, in Argentina (Martino et al., 2004) . These studies have shown that wild foxes in both Greenland and Argentina demonstrated no evidence of encephalitozoonosis within their populations. However, in farmed foxes the disease is endemic. This mirrors the situation in rabbits in the United Kingdom (Cox and Ross, 1980; Blevins, unpublished data; R. Saunders, personal communication) , where exposure is common in rabbit colonies and within the pet population but not in the wild rabbits, but contrasts with the situation in both the United States (Jungherr, 1955) and Australia (Thomas et al., 1997) , where exposure has been documented in wild rabbits. In the case of Australian rabbits the seroprevalence in the wild is suggested to have changed in recent Infectious Diseases of Domestic Rabbits 14 years. A study in 1980 found no evidence of exposure to E. cuniculi in wild rabbits in Victoria , whereas a study in 1997 showed a seroprevalence of 25% in wild rabbits in Western Australia (Thomas et al., 1997) . The mechanism for the shift in prevalence in the wild populations in both America and Australia is unknown. In the case of Australia it is possible that E. cuniculi was always present in wild rabbits in Western Australia, and is still not present in those in Victoria.",

Refractory diarrhoea, bronchitis, pneumonia and sinusitis are other possible manifestations. Hollister et al. (1991) found that there was serological evidence of widespread human exposure to E. cuniculi. It is interesting to note that in the USA the prevalent strain of E. cuniculi found in humans was strain III, which is usually associated with dogs, whereas in Europe strain I (the rabbit strain) was more commonly found (Didier et al., 1995) . With the discovery of HIV in the 1980s and the ever-increasing number of people undergoing chemotherapy and organ transplantation the relevance of E. cuniculi within the pet population as a potential zoonosis cannot be overstated.",

Affected animals showed muscular weakness, emaciation, polydipsia, polyuria and occasional neurological signs. Other texts describe encephalitozoonosis as a chronic, latent disease of rabbits that is significant because of its effects on experimental results. Infection with E. cuniculi in laboratory rabbits has caused many problems to scientific studies. Subclinical infection has vitiated experimental results and lesions caused by the parasite have been wrongly attributed to a number of other ailments (Wilson, 1979) . Encephalitozoonosis can interfere with test results. Blood samples of rabbits with spontaneous encephalitozoonosis have been shown to have significantly lower levels of catecholamines than healthy rabbits (Levkut et al., 1997) . Nowadays, laboratory rabbits are screened for E. cuniculi and seropositive animals eliminated. In the laboratory setting a 'test and remove' policy in conjunction with strict hygiene is frequently employed because infection with E. cuniculi can result in erroneous results during research trials (Ansbacher et al., 1988) . This is due to the fact that E. cuniculi modifies the way the central nervous system reacts to challenge.",

These are equally suitable for use on pet rabbits as well as in the laboratory setting. The majority of research into this disease has been carried out on laboratory rabbits. With an increase in the popularity of rabbits as pets and the number presented to veterinary surgeons for treatment, it is important to consider this disease from the pet rabbit perspective. In the domestic setting it is often not enough to be able to say a rabbit is infected; it is necessary to decide whether this is relevant to the health status of the individual concerned. A positive titre only reflects exposure but gives no indication of whether the disease is active. This is important in the treatment of the individual animal, but also has relevance to the human owners, since E. cuniculi is a potential zoonosis (Deplazes et al., 1996; Weber et al., 1997; Weitzel et al., 2001) .",

This increases the likelihood that concurrent clinical disease may occur (Harcourt-Brown and Holloway, 2003) . Similarly, infection with E. cuniculi can affect the way the central nervous system reacts to outside challenge. Ansbacher et al. (1988) showed that seropositive rabbits displayed an inconsistent inflammatory response both between individual rabbits and between sites within the same rabbit when coated platinum wires were implanted into four sites within the cerebral cortex. The response of each rabbit becomes unpredictable, and renders them unsuitable for many research projects. It is conceivable that response to intercurrent disease may be equally unpredictable.",

Two indirect immunofluorescence assays (IIF), two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and carbon immunoassay were compared. The results suggested that there was no difference between the assays in respect to detecting positive cases, but that quantitative determinations should be performed by IIF and not ELISA. This is proposed to be due to the less quantitative nature of the ELISA assay and not due to any reduction in sensitivity relative to the other methodologies.

In the USA cerebral larval migrans caused by Baylisascaris is also a differential. As encephalitozoonosis is a disease related to granuloma formation, clinical pathological evidence of this may be used to distinguish it from the possible alternate diagnoses. Of the above list only toxoplasmosis is likely to produce granulomatous lesions at the time of clinical signs becoming relevant. This disease is rarely diagnosed in UK rabbits and its significance can be eliminated by looking at paired titres for this organism. Similarly, the differential diagnoses for chronic renal failure are intrinsic renal failure, benign tumours, such as embryonal nephroma, renal cysts and malignant tumours, such as lymphoma and renal carcinoma. The defining feature of encephalitozoonosis is granulomatous change in the target organs, unlike the alternate causes of similar clinical symptoms. There are two challenges in determining the cause of many of these clinical signs. First is the reliance necessarily placed on invasive or post-mortem testing to achieve definitive diagnoses. Secondly, increases in absolute titres to E. cuniculi cannot be used diagnostically due to the difficulties in interpretation. Many workers doubt E. cuniculi as a cause of disease by itself (it does not in fact fulfil Koch's postulates), feeling that in many cases, signs attributed to the parasite are in fact caused by one of the differential diagnoses. Successful treatment of the alternative disease can bring about a clinical cure.

In this instance they stop the host cells becoming infected by preventing the extrusion of the polar filament. Thus, they limit spore formation. Albendazole has been the treatment of choice in human microsporidial infections; however, its use in rabbits is extrapolated from this and therefore anecdotal. Adverse reactions such as bone marrow disease, pyrexia and liver failure have been attributed to albendazole in rabbits. Albendazole is available as an oral preparation for cattle and sheep. It has been used to eliminate the Encephalitozoon spp. from human AIDS patients, sometimes with dramatic success (De Groote et al., 1995) . Elimination of the parasite is accompanied by relief of clinical symptoms in humans. Eradication of the parasite has been confirmed at autopsy (Joste et al., 1996; Sobottka et al., 1995) . Albendazole has also been used to treat clinical cases of E. cuniculi in pet rabbits, with no reports of adverse effects and apparent improvement in clinical symptoms. The pharmacokinetic effects of the agent have been tested on rabbits (Li et al., 1995) . An empirical course of 3-10 days' treatment appears to be beneficial. In-contact rabbits should be treated as a precaution, although albendazole is potentially teratogenic and is not advisable in breeding females. While it is difficult to support the use of this drug in the face of other proven less toxic compounds, its penetration into ocular tissues and its success in treating ocular manifestations of encephalitozoonosis should not be ignored.",

Glucocorticoids: the use of glucocorticoids has been advocated in the acute phase of encephalitozoonosis, in order to suppress the inflammatory response. However, rabbits are very sensitive to the immunosuppressive effects of steroids and their use in this species is always controversial. Treated individuals should be monitored closely. 3. Fluoroquinolones: for example, enrofloxacin, an antibiotic known to be safe for and licensed for use in rabbits, has been shown to have some antimicrosporidial action in vitro. The use of fluoroquinolones in the vestibular form of encephalitozoonosis is sensible, particularly as they are also effective in treating some of the main differential diagnoses such as pasteurellosis. 4. Other antibiotics: oxytetracyclines and potentiated sulphonamides have also been recommended for use in treating encephalitozoonosis.

Once the host immune responses are established, the organisms can be found as cysts in various tissues where they can remain for years (Owen, 1992) . The source of infection for rabbits is feed contaminated by cat faeces and symptoms have been described in rabbits that grazed an area frequented by cats. Clinical signs are Infectious Diseases of Domestic Rabbits 14 most common in the acute phase in young rabbits. Sudden anorexia, pyrexia and death are the usual signs, although CNS symptoms such as posterior paralysis or seizures can also occur (Leland et al., 1992) .

High antibody titres have been found in wild rabbits collected from sewerage farms in Australia (Cox et al., 1981) . Ashmawy et al. (2011) examined the seroprevalence of exposure to toxoplasmosis in several rabbit farms in Egypt. Eleven per cent of rabbits had been exposed, which presented a public health risk for eating rabbit meat. Positive serology only indicates exposure to infection. Gustaffson et al.

Domestic rabbits were found to be resistant to toxoplasmosis in comparison with the mountain hare. In the mountain hare, toxoplasmosis is acutely fatal and characterized by necrosis and tissue damage in the small intestine, mesenteric lymph nodes and liver. In the domestic rabbit, lesions are mild, consisting of focal accumulations of mononuclear cells, mainly in the liver and heart. Histopathology is diagnostic. Antibodies are detected early as 7-8 days post-infection (Gustaffson et al., 1997) .",

There are several capsular and somatic serotypes of P. multocida that are pathogenic for domestic Textbook of Rabbit Medicine livestock and poultry, but only a few are pathogenic for rabbits. Serotyping entails the identification of the capsular antigen and serotypes. In rabbits, serotypes 12:A, 3:A and 3:D are the usual types identified (Percy and Barthold, 1993) . Snuffles is most frequently associated with 12:A, whereas 3:A and occasionally 3:D are more frequently associated with disease of the lower respiratory tract. Jaglic et al. (2008) studied the pathogenicity of serotype F in both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed individuals. Immunocompetent rabbits showed fibrinopurulent pneumonia while immunosuppressed individuals had severe diffuse haemorrhagic pneumonia. A septicaemic syndrome that was eventually fatal occurred in both groups. This indicates that serotype F is a potentially serious pathogen, and could cause serious losses in commercial rabbitries. Virulence of infection varies between serotypes. Pasteurella multocida produces an endotoxin that varies with serotype. The role of the endotoxin in clinical disease is unclear, although it may be significant in septicaemic cases. The bacteria also produce adhesins which stick the bacteria to epithelial tissue. Filamentous appendages elaborated by the bacteria may help P. multocida colonize mucous membranes (Deeb, 1993) . The adhesive properties vary with different serotypes of P. multocida and could be important in the pathogenesis of the disease (Manning et al., 1989) . Mucosal antibodies (IgA) inhibit growth of bacteria and are produced in response to exposure to P. multocida. High humoral (IgG) antibody levels are associated with chronic infection and have been used to identify infected rabbits in laboratory colonies (Deeb, 1993).",

In pet rabbits, dental disease and nasal foreign bodies can cause similar signs (see Section 11.2.3). The thick sticky white discharge from the nose is wiped away with the forelegs, leading to a yellow staining and matting of the fur. Poor husbandry, overcrowding, poor ventilation, dust conditions and ammonia build-up exacerbate the disease.

Other methods of producing disease-free rabbits involve Caesarean derivation with hand-rearing (Manning et al., 1989) or the transfer of fertilized ova to Pasteurella-free does. Early weaning and the use of antibiotics can increase the number of disease-free individuals. To ensure an uninfected status, periodic serological testing for antibodies to Pasteurella is necessary.

The bacterium cannot be grown in vitro but can be grown in tissue culture. The bacterial genome is closely related to Clostridium Textbook of Rabbit Medicine species and, in recent years, the organism has been reclassified as Clostridium piliforme rather than Bacillus piliformis (Besch-Williford, 1997). Tyzzer's disease can affect a wide range of animals, including rodents, cats and monkeys (Delong and Manning, 1994) . The disease affects the caecum, intestine and liver, causing acute diarrhoea and sudden death in the acute stage and intestinal fibrosis, stenosis and liver necrosis in chronic cases. The myocardium can also be affected. The disease usually occurs in weanling rabbits 6-12 weeks old but can occur at any age and is often predisposed by stress. It is a major differential in outbreaks of diarrhoea in rabbit colonies. Recent advances in tissue culture have led to development of diagnostic tests and serological testing is now possible in some countries. A PCR for detecting ribosomal DNA sequences has also been developed; however, the agreement between serology and PCR is not close. The presence of antibody in apparently healthy animals suggests latent infection of the intestinal tract; however, false-positive results can occur due to cross-reaction with non-pathogenic bacteria (Pritt et al., 2010) . Stress or immunosuppression can precipitate overt disease (Delong and Manning, 1994) . Transmission occurs by ingestion of spores that can survive in the environment for some time after an infected animal has been removed.

Clostridium spiriforme produces an iota toxin. Glucose is required as a substrate for iota toxin formation. High dietary starch levels are believed to predispose to enterotoxaemia by causing 'carbohydrate overload' of the caecum. Residual starch that reaches the caecum can be broken down to release glucose as a substrate for iota toxin formation. This situation is more likely to occur in juvenile rabbits rather than adults. Immature rabbits do not digest starch efficiently in the small intestine, but in adult animals starch is broken down and absorbed before it reaches the caecum. In adults, enterotoxaemia is usually related to other factors such as stress or antibiotic therapy, which disrupt the caecal microflora and allow Clostridium spp. to proliferate.",

It was first recognized in England in 1953 after it crossed the channel from France, where it was illegally introduced in 1952. Prior to this, in 1952, infected rabbits had been released into the Heisker Islands in the Outer Hebrides as a deliberate experiment in pest control. Two years later, in 1954, the rabbit population was as large as ever despite the considerable mortality that resulted from myxomatosis (Fenner and Fantani, 1999) . Although there were efforts to eradicate myxomatosis in the UK, the disease spread rapidly through the wild rabbit population in the summer of 1953 and was endemic by the late 1950s. The attitude to myxomatosis in the UK was different from other parts of the world. Rabbits were frequently kept as pets and there was outcry at the sight of blind, sick rabbits stumbling along roads or on commons and other public places. As a result, in 1954, it became an offence knowingly to use or permit the use of an infected rabbit to spread the disease into an uninfected population. This law was difficult to enforce.",

In the UK, disease outbreaks tend to remain localized with isolated pockets of infection and the disease is only sporadically encountered in pet rabbits. The difference in epidemiology is attributed to the difference in the life cycle of insect vectors. In the UK, the European rabbit flea, S. cuniculi, is the major insect vector rather than mosquito species Aedes and Anopheles spp. Even in the absence of the host, fleas can maintain infectivity throughout the winter and act as a reservoir of infection for the following year. Fleas are an effective means of transmission due to their life cycle, which is synchronized with the reproductive status of the doe and results in heavy flea infestations of susceptible neonates.",

The disease starts with a skin lesion, which typically develops 4-5 days after inoculation of the virus and enlarges to become about 3 cm in diameter 9-10 days after infection.

British rabbits were slow to develop resistance in comparison with Australian rabbits (Fenner and Ross, 1994) . A phenomenon known as 'paternal resistance' is also described.

Ambient temperature affects the course of the disease, with high environmental temperature increasing recovery rate (85 F).

Opioid analgesics do not appear to be effective in ameliorating signs of pain. In a study of the effect of buprenorphine on the course of myxomatosis in laboratory rabbits, there was no difference in survival time. Treated rabbits refused food and water a day earlier than untreated rabbits and had lower rectal temperatures immediately prior to death (Robinson et al., 1999) . Rabbits vaccinated against myxomatosis can also be clinically affected, and develop an atypical form of myxomatosis (lumpy bunny syndrome). The severity of the disease is variable and can range from a well rabbit with a single lump to one that is very poorly with multiple skins lesions. The prognosis is less bleak for these individuals, as many of them can recover with appropriate supportive care.",

It is caused by a host-specific calicivirus. VHD only affects the European rabbit. The disease may be called 'rabbit haemorrhagic disease' (RHD) and the virus known as 'rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus' (RHDV). Sometimes the term 'rabbit calicivirus disease' (RCD) is used. VHD originated in 1984 in the People's Republic of China, which, at that time, was the world's largest exporter of rabbit meat. A disease broke out in a colony of angora rabbits that had recently been imported into Germany (Fenner and Fantani, 1999) . Except for the suckling rabbits, all the rabbits died within a week and in less than 9 months the disease had spread over 50,000 km 2 and reached Italy and Europe. By 1988, VHD had been reported in commercial rabbits in many countries worldwide, probably introduced through rabbit meat. In Europe, the disease spread into the wild rabbit population. In 1990, VHD reached Scandinavia. Wild rabbits in the densely populated island of Gotland became nearly extinct within 1 week (Gavier-Wid\u00e9n, 1996) . Hundreds of rabbits were seen dead in the fields and many more died in their burrows. Pet rabbits that had been kept indoors and fed on commercial food started dying, indicating that humans can act as vectors for VHD.",

Infected young rabbits survive and become immune, so when the disease becomes endemic the morbidity and mortality rate falls. In wild rabbits, the disease appears to break out every second year. Insects mechanically transmit the virus in viraemic blood from one animal to another. VHD virus can survive for several weeks in carcasses and skin. Fleas, blowflies and mosquitoes are known to spread the disease (Fenner and Fantani, 1999) . PCR techniques have shown that virus can be retained in the body of blowflies for up to 9 days and bushflies for 7 days. Fly 'spots' (faeces) are also infective and can contaminate pasture. Flies can travel long distances and be carried along by the wind and spread the disease far and wide. It has also been demonstrated that domestic and wild carnivores can play an important role in the epidemiology of VHD since virulent material can be collected from faecal material after experimental oral inoculation. The virus is very stable in carcasses even after freezing and thawing (Lumeij, 1997) . Up until October 1996, VHD was a notifiable disease in Great Britain. It is now endemic and poses a real threat to the pet rabbit due to its resistance and ease of transmission. Deaths have been reported nationwide that have been confirmed at postmortem to be due to VHD. Figure 14 .6 The liver of a rabbit that had died from viral haemorrhagic disease (VHD). The typical appearance of the liver of a rabbit that has died from VHD is shown. The liver is enlarged, although not strikingly so, and friable and pale, with a distinct lobular pattern. The liver is always affected in cases of VHD, although the gross appearance may not reflect the severe histopathological changes. The histological appearance of the liver is often diagnostic.

The disease can be peracute, with animals being found dead within a few hours of eating and behaving normally. Acute cases are quiet and pyrexic with an increased respiratory rate and usually die within 12 h. A feature of the disease is a dramatic drop in blood pressure that makes it difficult to find a vein to take blood samples or set up intravenous fluids. Dying rabbits are pallid, shocked and collapsed. Haematuria, haemorrhagic vaginal discharges or foamy/ bloody exudate from the nostrils may be seen. Vascular infarcts can occur within the brain and occasionally convulsions or other neurological signs are seen just before death. Agonal vocalizing and cyanosis have been described (Donnelly, 1995) . The 'classic' picture is a dead rabbit in opisthotonus with a haemorrhagic nasal discharge. The occasional rabbit can recover from the acute phase, only to develop jaundice and die a few days later. Young rabbits less than 4 weeks of age remain unaffected and develop a lifelong immunity if they are exposed to the disease. Unexposed rabbits become increasingly susceptible until 6-10 weeks of age when physiological resistance to the virus disappears. The physiological age immunity of young rabbits has been ascribed to the increase in hepatic transaminase production that occurs after 5 weeks of age (Donnelly, 1995) . In adult rabbits, the mortality rate is high. There is no treatment for affected rabbits.",

The liver is enlarged, friable and pale with a distinct lobular pattern (see Figure 14 .6). The spleen is also enlarged. Haemorrhages can be found in any organ but are usually present in the lung. The trachea is often full of a foamy exudate. Haematologically, there are fibrin thrombi, lymphopenia, a reduction in platelets and a failure of other bloodclotting factors that result in multiple-organ failure due to general circulatory dysfunction. Disseminated intravascular coagulation is a characteristic feature of the pathogenesis of VHD (Chasey, 1997) . Histopathology confirms acute hepatic necrosis. There may be many other changes such as acute nephropathy or alveolar haemorrhage. Congestion and haemorrhages can occur in any organ due to terminal intravascular coagulation. The typical histopathological changes in the liver are usually diagnostic but there are a number of other tests that confirm the diagnosis, including hamagglutination tests and electron microscopy. Large numbers of characteristic calicivirus can be detected by electron microscopic examination of liver (Chasey et al., 1995) . Fresh liver is required by the laboratory.

Shope papillomavirus is immunologically distinct from the other papillomaviruses, and causes oral papillomatosis. Oral papillomatosis is manifested by wart-like growths on the ventral aspect of the tongue and on other parts of the oral mucosa. The virus is transmitted in oral secretions containing sloughed cells from the warts. Young rabbits are most susceptible and the papillomas grow slowly over a period of 6-9 months. The animals become immune, at which point the base of the papilloma becomes inflamed, causing sloughing of the tumour, ulcer formation and finally re-epithelialization. Oral papillomas of rabbits are not known to undergo carcinomatous transformation (Kraus et al., 1984) .",

The disease was first recognized in the 1960s in rabbits inoculated with suspensions of rabbit testes containing Treponema pallidum (human syphilis). Subsequently, the agent has been detected in T. pallidum-infected rabbit tissue throughout the world. Coronavirus infection is used experimentally to produce a rabbit model of Infectious Diseases of Domestic Rabbits 14 cardiomyopathy and has only been described in laboratory rabbits. Antibodies to the virus cross-react with human and other mammalian coronaviruses (DiGiacomo and Mare, 1994). 14.7 Mycotic infections 14.7.1 Dermatophytosis Dermatophytosis (ringworm) is occasionally encountered in rabbits. Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Microsporum canis are the species most commonly described (Percy and Barthold, 1993) . Lesions are usually found on the base of the ears and muzzle, but can involve other areas of the body such as the paws (see Section 7.15). Asymptomatic carriers can occur. Young rabbits are most likely to be affected (Vangeel et al., 2000) . Dermatophilus congolensis has been isolated from rabbits.",
