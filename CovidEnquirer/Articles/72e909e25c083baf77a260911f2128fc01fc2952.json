Instead, by definition they already have an approved drug or advanced clinical candidate well on its way to approval from which they hope to recoup the costs of this project as well as their less successful research and make a shareholder-pleasing profit to boot. And with the \"blockbuster mentality\" currently no less ensconced in big pharma management than it is in Hollywood, one can be sure that such a target is likely to draw whole flocks of companies to that particular watering hole. Trying to find enough room to squeeze in and enjoy may not be easy. After the first-in-class drug, a plethora of competing drugs will probably follow. And, as a recent study has shown, that profitable period of market exclusivity, when a single first-in-class approved drug exists for a given target, is becoming shorter and shorter, down to an average of 1.8 years in the late 1990s 1 and probably to only a matter of months today. That same study uses a statistical analysis of drug approvals by date to demonstrate the eye-opening fact that in recent years second-and third-in-class drugs were more likely to have been competitors vying for initial approval with the eventual first-in-class winner, than copycat compounds trying to shoehorn into its established market later. These competitors just didn't happen to win first place in the race, but they were very much in it, having started before the target was an \"established\" one. All of which begs the question of what exactly a \"me-too\" drug might be these days. Dr Albert Wertheimer of Temple University uses the following scenario: \"Three different labs all start out within a month of each other and one is more successful with FDA or they had fewer questions or their CRO was more efficient or was luckier in getting more patients faster. So one of them got FDA approval first and we say, 'Ah, that's the originator!' But in France the one that came in second here could have been first there, and the American 'innovator' here is 'me-too' there. So what's a 'me-too'?\"",

So starting that late raises a new annoying but incisive question, \"Do you really want to bring the fourth-or fifth-in-class drug to market?\" 2 Now, most researchers whom I've ever met treasure innovation and are highly competitive. To them this prospect seems about as exciting as entering a race where the first three winners were announced before the gun was even fired. They won't be the only ones wondering how such a drug could get any significant market share when facing such competition. The research chemist, particularly if he ends up working with a close structural analog of the marketed drug, which is frequently the case in this kind of project, will inevitably think of it as a \"me-too\" project, while management will likely use a more elegant term like innovative improvement. 3 Fast follower is yet another tag sometimes used for this type of project, although, as mentioned above, \"fast\" here only applies on a geological time scale. There's a certain element of truth to all of these terms, but neither they nor any other two-word phrases can explain all that's really going on with such a project.",

It's not quite the same as making the decision to buy a bank CD versus buying Internet stocks as an investment. In the drug discovery business there is no truly low risk strategy. Everyone involved is something of a gambler. But in this approach, everyone is confident that at least the target is a good one and it has been shown to lead to a salable therapeutic agent. Many useful, profitable drugs have come out of this approach. And this approach per se doesn't imply that chemists will be bored to tears generating compounds nearly identical to a known drug but falling into an IP loophole: patent poaching (another two-word epitaph). At least in theory, an established target can be approached with molecules resembling established drugs or it can be targeted with compounds looking nothing like any of them. The target doesn't necessarily define the chemistry, but, as we'll see, since using a known drug or pharmacophore as a starting point shortens the time to having an identifiable lead, it sometimes does for this type of project.",

All the full time employees (FTEs) and the budget saved in eliminating the first two steps and maybe even more could be required to get the resulting drug to market while there's still time. But, if the competition is so far ahead-assuming one isn't competing with oneself in a second generation project-that it won't even be remotely possible to beat them to the market, how can the company hope to sell the drug?

This can take the form of greater efficacy (clinical studies prove that it just works better), better dosing regimen (say once daily as opposed to several times a day), or reduced toxicity (causing fewer or less severe side effects). What do these things mean to the medicinal chemist? They mean that while synthesizing and selecting the clinical candidate the emphasis will be on superiority to the existing drug in terms of some important and hopefully measurable property such as in vivo half-life in PK studies, where superiority could mean once (q.d.) versus thrice (t.i.d.) daily dosing, or selectivity against known antitargets implicated in observed toxicity for the existing drug. If no such advantage is found and the best that can be obtained is something equivalent to what's already out there or soon will be, the company may decide not to spend many millions of dollars required to try and bring it to the market. But the catch is that often advantages or disadvantages may not become evident until Phase II or Phase III clinical trials or even later, so who can really say short of that? A candidate with no obvious advantage might still be moved forward, but the project and the drug become a much harder sell, both internally and externally.",

Does Henry Ford's Model T outperform the car in your driveway? Does Ford still sell a lot of them? The new drug business is an evolutionary process both in terms of targets for a given disease and drugs to treat any one of those targets, which means that \"first-in-class\" can eventually even become \"worst-in-class.\" Prescription drugs, like anything else, are imperfect and there's plenty of room for improvement.",

Other factors, including the marketing might of Pfizer are, no doubt, a big part of Lipitor's success story, but the point is that working on yet another drug for an established target is sometimes a legitimate formula for success, both from the point of view of the corporate executives and of the patients who take it.",

Only desperate corporate executives transfixed by Gantt charts could love such a project. Chemists would rather make novel-meaning highly dissimilar-structures. But dissimilar structures per se convey no advantage in the clinic. No physician is going to ask a patient, \"Wouldn't you rather take an oxazole than a pyrimidine?\" Once a drug has reached clinical testing, structure is largely irrelevant. Only two things really matter: safety and efficacy. That's where your compound needs to demonstrate its uniqueness. If the oxazole is less likely than the pyrimidine to be biotransformed into a toxic metabolite, allowing the question to become, \"Wouldn't you rather take a safer compound than a more dangerous one?\" then the clinical and marketing advantages are obvious. Structural dissimilarity probably will provide a basis for new chemistry, new papers, and patents, all of which really are benefits.

Two other diabetes drugs, the PPAR agonists Rezulin (troglitazone), which was withdrawn from the market due to liver toxicity, and Avandia (rosiglitazone) still an important drug today, although one recently highlighting another toxicity concern, 7 share a similar story with a different type of toxicity involved.",

If that happens, and, as we've seen in Chapter 2, there are those who believe it will, 8 it would be very hard for pharma companies to justify high-initial pricing for a fourth-in-class or fifth-in-class drug regardless of its advantages.

There are often already hundreds of existing composition-of-matter patents issued for compounds acting on such a target, each with a Markush structure implying more compounds than there are stars in the heavens. Gazing at page after page of descriptions of such structures brings the chemist closer to a true understanding of infinity, not to mention despair of ever finding something not covered. Add to that the fear that even if you do happen upon something not claimed in existing patents it doesn't mean that work isn't already underway somewhere to cover it in future ones. As we saw in Chapter 3, it takes 18 months from the date of filing for a patent application to be published. So whatever holes you find in their published ones may be in the process of being patched before you ever find them. Even leads which may have come out of screening and appeared to be proprietary may not be. All of this means that it might just be impossible to find a patentable compound of your own to develop when it comes to an established therapeutic target. And no patent generally means no project.",

Projects directed at this have encountered the usual difficulties of trying to mimic protein-protein interactions with small molecules, although recently a publication from Sunesis describes a small molecule inhibitor of this interaction which acts by essentially displacing one of the subunits of the normally trimeric ligand. 11, 12 For any such project directed at a small molecule interacting with a target that's already been validated in the marketplace by biologics, the drug's advantages are obvious, IP space is wide open (since probably no one else has such an agent either, although they may be looking for one), and the market for the resulting drug is almost guaranteed. The only stumbling block, which must not be underestimated, is finding such an agent-it's just not clear that it can be done.

Tools for thus perturbing protein function (RNAi, knockout, antibodies, etc.) can vary, as discussed in the next section, and different results can sometimes be obtained with different tools. Early stage projects usually lack small molecules capable of selectively interfering with a single desired target, so at that point TV experiments often use other methods, but ultimately small molecules will provide the best validation when a small molecule drug is the goal. Many proposed targets will drop out even at this lowest validation level. For those that don't, the push will be onto develop a tool (small molecule, antibody, etc.) capable of selectively perturbing the target in an animal model of disease. Achieving this first in vivo proof-of-concept (POC), thus reaching Level II validation in our scheme, is a major milestone and cause for celebration in any project, but it still doesn't prove that an efficacious drug is just around the corner. Level II validation in cancer might mean tumor growth inhibition, or, better still, regression in a xenograft (using human cancer cells in an immune compromised animal) or syngeneic (using a cancer native to the species) mouse model. For cancer especially, efficacy in a single model doesn't really predict human clinical success. But it's generally true that a compound that works in many different models has a better shot at clinical efficacy than the one that's only effective in a few. 21 The upshot is that for many indications Level II validation needs to be established in multiple models for it to mean much.",

            "text": "A study by researchers at Lexicon Genomics (now Lexicon Pharmaceuticals) looked at the targets for the top 100 prescription drugs and found that for the targets where knockout models could be generated (most of them) in 85% of the cases the knockouts produced phenotypes that were \"informative\" for the therapeutic indication involved. 25 Not only Lexicon but also National Institutes of Health (NIH) has now embarked on projects aimed at knocking out most if not all of the genes found in mouse. 26 Like any tool, though, knockouts aren't universally applicable and free of all problems. Although many knockout mice are now commercially available (but expensive), most require quite a bit of time and money to generate. In many cases (some say 20% of the time, others say more frequently) knockouts result in embryonic or neonatal lethality, the absent protein apparently being required for proper development whether or not they're needed later. When this happens, of course, information about the target protein's role in mature animals can't be obtained, although sometimes the lethality itself means something: finding embryonic lethality due to defective blood vessel formation in heterozygous vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) knockouts implied that nature didn't have any good ways of compensating for its loss during angiogenesis. This provided a key piece of information in developing antiangiogenic anticancer compounds like Avastin, a VEGF antibody. 27 In general, nature is adept at compensating for the loss of an incredible variety of proteins, and this presents a problem when phenotypes one expects to observe just aren't there because compensation by redundant mechanisms happened during the development. And, surprisingly, different phenotypes are sometimes observed for the same knockout when different strains of mice are used. 28 Furthermore, the phenotypes that are observed in knockout mice For the important PPAR receptor, heterozygous knockout mice demonstrated improved sensitivity to insulin when fed with a high-fat diet, which suggests the strategy of using PPAR antagonists to treat diabetes. 29 However antidiabetic thiazolidinediones like rosiglitazone, which improve insulin sensitivity are PPAR agonists. Needless to say, this took a bit of explaining. 30 One big reason that knockout results may not correspond with results obtained using small molecules is that prospective target proteins may well be involved in more than the one particular activity that a small molecule might target. A small molecule might just interfere with its binding to a ligand at one site, but proteins are often multidomain and can form necessary complexes with other proteins via interactions not affected by the small molecule. This effect, illustrated graphically in Figure 5 .5, means that small molecules are capable of tweaking proteins while knockouts, as the name implies, aren't exactly a light tap on the cheek. \"Knockout of a gene results in complete loss of the target protein, which can disrupt protein complexes or impair functional domains that would be unaffected by a drug. These secondary effects can dominate the phenotype of a knockout, such that a knockout and a small molecule inhibitor targeting the same protein produce very different outcomes.\" 31 The authors of this quote recommend a less blunt-force transgenic method, replacing target proteins with mutants lacking catalytic activity (knock-ins) rather than deleting them altogether, as a more predictive alternative to knockouts. They provide an example (that of the kinase p110) where the two techniques produced opposite phenotypes. Along with other techniques like conditional knockouts, where the absence of a protein can be induced specifically in a desired tissue, such knock-ins provide additional useful tools for TV.",

            "text": "In 1978, researchers at Harvard reported that a 13-base deoxynucleotide segment which was complementary to a section of Rous sarcoma virus mRNA could block virus production in cell culture. 32 Later work demonstrated that such antisense oligonucleotides (AOs), varying in length from 7-mers to about 30-mers, bind to their target mRNA sequences through Watson-Crick base pairing and either lead to cleavage of the mRNA by the enzyme RNAse H or prevent translation by other mechanisms. 33 The end result is the same, however: production of the target protein is shut down (see Figure 5 .6). \"Naked\" oligos like the 13-mer used for Rous sarcoma virus are rarely used nowadays. They normally aren't very stable because of the presence of nucleases, endogenous enzymes which can cleave them in minutes. This means that chemical modifications are normally required for them to stick around long enough to have a good effect. One of the earliest and the most consistently used modifications involves replacing a non-bridging oxygen atom in the phosphate linkage with a sulfur atom, resulting in phosphorothioate deoxyoligonucleotides. Others involve alkylation of the 2 0 hydroxy groups of ribonucleotide oligomers with methyl or methoxyethyl groups (which also seems to increase their affinity for target mRNA), generation of methylphosphonates in place of phosphate linkages, and various modifications in the bases or in the ribose moiety, some even going so far as to replace the ribose rings with morpholines or polyamides. Sometimes chimeric oligos incorporating several of these modifications at different positions are used. 34 Not every stretch of a given protein's mRNA sequence is a good site for AO binding, so some experimentation is required, but since only gene sequence information, not secondary or tertiary protein structural information is required to design such tool compounds, they can be generated much more quickly than small molecule inhibitors. Getting them into cells, however, isn't always as straightforward, and works better in some types of cells than in others. Methods for transfection include the use of polycationic reagents, liposomes, and special techniques like electroporation and microinjection. Antisense oligonucleotides have proven to be useful for TV both in cells and in animals, where the embryonic lethality often seen in knockouts is not an issue. 35 Limitations, though, include possible non-specific effects due to interactions with various proteins and toxicity due to the transfection reagents that need to be used. As with the use of knockouts for TV, the absence (not just presence in inactive form) of target protein might invoke phenotypes that differ from those seen with small molecule inhibitors. Unlike knockout, however, the target protein will probably not be 100% absent when using antisense techniques, although >70% knockdown is often achieved. Importantly, since antisense reagents interact with cells or animals that already have the target proteins present and merely prevent future production of them, a lot depends on the half-life of the existing protein. If it's on the order of days (which can happen) it may take at least that long for antisense knockdown to have any effect on phenotype, yet another reason why AOs need to be very stable.",

These also have 5 0 -phosphate groups and are called small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Unwinding of the strands and association with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) allows the antisense strand to guide to the complex to the targeted mRNA by hybridization with the right mRNA sense sequence. Once bound, the mRNA is cleaved in the center of the cognate sequence by the This catalytic mechanism is believed to have evolved as a defense against viruses in simple organisms lacking more complex immune systems, but it isn't used that way in mammals. Putting ds RNA segments longer than 30 nucleotides into mammalian cells is problematic: an interferon response is induced and the cells tend to die. Because of this RNAi is normally achieved using presynthesized 21-23 nucleotide siRNA reagents that are transfected into cells using methods (carriers, electroporation) similar to those used for AOs ( Figure 5.7(b) ), or by introducing a DNA vector for short hairpin RNA (shRNA), which is converted to the relevant siRNA reagent within the cells. 39 \"Naked\" siRNAs, being double stranded, are more stable than \"naked\" AOs, and are, unlike the latter, normally fine for cellular experiments. But for in vivo use where they're added exogenously, their stabilities, 40 PK parameters, and perhaps affinities might need to be improved by the same sorts of chemical modification (phosphorothioates, etc.) used for antisense reagents. 41 Reagents for siRNA experiments in cells are probably the easiest of all TV tools to come by. They can be designed solely on the basis of gene sequence and ordered over the Internet. Vast siRNA libraries can now be purchased as well. As with AOs, getting the compound into the cells can be the trickiest part of the whole process, multiple controls containing some mismatches need to be used, and actual target protein levels need to be determined before any conclusions are arrived at. But compared to the efforts involved in finding a potent, selective small molecule inhibitor of the target, RNAi can constitute a much easier route to early TV, particularly for classes of targets where good small molecule tools are hard to come by. And most, but not all, studies comparing the use of siRNA with that of AOs have found the former to be effective at lower concentrations. 42 These advantages go a long way toward explaining the increasing popularity of RNAi in TV. In a typical recent example, a commercially available siRNA targeting matrix metalloprotease-11 (MMP-11) impeded cell proliferation, resulted in apoptosis in the mouse hepatocarcinoma cell line Hca-F, and attenuated the metastatic potential of these cells in a mouse model. 43 Researchers at Genentech took advantage of conditional RNAi, a newer technique 44 to show that knocking down BRAF, a serine-threonine kinase, slowed tumor growth in one xenograft mouse model of metastatic melanoma and caused regression in another, thus providing in vivo validation for BRAF as a cancer target. 45 Small molecule inhibitors of this novel target exist but are not selective.",

The sometimes non-specific effects of siRNA are an area of ongoing research, but things need to be kept in perspective: \"While off-target activity of siRNA has received a large press coverage lately, the difficulty in obtaining small-molecule specificity has been an ongoing struggle within the pharmaceutical industry for many years.\" 49 This would make arguments against the use of siRNA reagents by chemists because of an alleged lack of specificity a little like the pot calling the kettle black. Specificity is an issue for any TV tool, or for that matter any therapeutic modality. Methods for demonstrating specificity, especially the use of rescue experiments (adding back the gene product via a transcript sequence that the siRNA doesn't target) and using multiple siRNA reagents targeting different parts of the transcript, have been suggested. 50 Another assumption that dsRNA with less than 30 nucleotides (read, siRNAs) will never cause an interferon response has also been called into question. 51 These kinds of problems are to be expected for such a young technology, but in many ways the most remarkable thing is how far it's come in such a short time.

Ghrelin is a 28-amino acid peptide that's an endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a (GHS-R1a) and a potential obesity target that gets a lot of press coverage. Pegylated L-NOX-B11 was found to inhibit ghrelin's effects in central nervous system (CNS) in an in vivo experiment, 65 and a successor spiegelmer produced weight loss in a diet-induced mouse obesity model. 66 Most aptamers find use against extracellular targets, 67 but, as with antibodies, an intracellular version of this technology also exists, in this case called intramers. 68 A good review of the use of aptamers for TV was recently published, 69 emphasizing the utility of aptamers in HTS assays as well.

Existing therapeutics can work but have limitations. So when different classes of them are available they're frequently used together in the kind of combination therapy as discussed in Chapter 1. Here, the beneficial effects can be additive or, better yet, synergistic, although studies will need to be carried out to make sure that their toxicities aren't synergistic too.",

The first target to be broached in the war on this fearsome virus was an enzyme called reverse transcriptase (RT), which the virus requires to convert its genomic RNA into DNA, and the first approved drug to target it was the nucleoside analog Retrovir (zidovudine, AZT, Figure 5 .9), which had originally been looked at for cancer. Although this compound alone proved a lifesaver for many AIDS patients, efficacy was not ideal and toxicity in the form of neutropenia, severe anemia, and liver disorders was encountered in some patients. Furthermore, the fast and sloppy replication process the virus uses soon gave rise to mutations, some of which were resistant to the effects of the drug.",

It might not be simply a matter of browsing through catalogs for reagents or kits or tracking down a procedure in Methods in Enzymology. Real work might need to go into it, which means FTEs will need to be approved by the management for a speculative project that hasn't even begun yet. Most likely, small molecules acting on the prospective target won't be known either, and as we've seen, small molecule inhibitors or agonists or antagonists are very fine tools for biologists to have at their disposal when doing TV. It could be that such a tool molecule wouldn't be available until the project is in full swing lead optimization (LO) mode, which a company is unlikely to enter until a target has been better validated, a sort of a Catch-22. Normally, this would mean that validation would need to progress without a small molecule tool. But there is one other way that's based on the preference of target families to bind to structurally similar compounds, as noted earlier. This is called chemogenomics. Dr Mark Murcko of Vertex Pharmaceuticals provides an example of how this might work for a real-world project: \"In the area of kinases or ion channels or GPCRs we've already worked on other members of the family,\" he notes. \"We already have some know-how about how to set up an assay in the field.

This process goes by the name of forward genetics. Mutagenesis here is usually accomplished through the random mutations induced by a nasty chemical mutagen like ENU, ethylnitrosourea. If instead, we use as our perturbogen 77 a library of small molecules which, rather than causing mutations, might interact with cellular proteins through inhibition, antagonism, or agonism, the process becomes what is known as forward chemical genetics. 78 Figure 5 .10 is a simple schematic illustrating how this works.",

In a way, this represents a return to the older drug discovery methodology that prevailed in the days of broth extract screening and tissue or even whole animal primary assays for synthesized compounds, back before the new field of molecular biology shone the bright spotlight of scientific inquiry on specific molecular targets. Although nobody suggests that we turn that spotlight off, many people feel that illuminating the rest of the stage as well could only help. In that context, phenotype screening and other types of multitarget or high-content screening (HCS, which usually implies the use of subcellular fluorescence imaging) represent a valuable addition to the armamentarium of drug discovery. 79 There's a lot of diversity in the kind of assays that can be carried out, some of them having only been enabled by recent technologies, such as the ability to detect cell morphology changes by microscopy in a high-throughput format. Cells (which of course don't constitute an in vivo system except in the case of single-celled organisms) can also be engineered to express things like known chemotherapy resistance factors and then compounds screened for their ability to restore the antiproliferative effects of a cancer drug like doxorubicin. 80 In some cases where traditional cellular models are hard to come by, such as HCV, which isn't amenable to simple infection and reproduction in cultured hepatocytes, cells can be engineered to express self-amplifying \"minigenomes\" called replicons containing the non-structural viral proteins, which represent most (but not all) conceivable antiviral targets. 81 A compound active in such an assay might be hitting any of them. 82 True organisms, rather than cells, such as nematodes (C. elegans) 83 and zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio) 84 can be used in multitarget assays. Readouts can be as simple as fluorescence or as complex as a detailed analysis of modified protein pathways. 85 Even beginning to understand all the possible variations on this type of screening strategy is a daunting prospect, but however many there are and however complex they may be, they all have a couple of things in common. They allow one to screen for drugs in a complex living system, which is more \"real world\" than an isolated enzyme or receptor binding assay, and to \"cast a much wider net than target-by-target approaches.\" 85 An overall summary of the advantages and disadvantages of using this type of drug discovery methodology is shown in Box 5.4. The single biggest advantage of this method is that by definition hits give real effects in cells, rather than an effect on an isolated target that may or may not work in a cellular milieu when tested later. Note, however, that initial hits, which are defined by some arbitrary level of response in a high-or medium-throughput screen which has been validated by running a positive control, require a certain amount of follow-up before any conclusions can be drawn. It's not as simple as looking at the raw data for the screen. Artifacts must be ruled out, identity, purity, and good dose-response need to be established, all of which are further discussed in Chapter 6.",

Such drugs might even make it to market without a known MOA. But the reality is that a drug going into the clinic without a known target is at a serious disadvantage, and many companies will be reluctant to pursue it for that reason.

Knowing what the target is can also give scientists an idea of what the antitargets, related proteins possibly responsible for toxicity, might be. So in the real world identification of hits using phenotype screening will inevitably be followed by attempts to determine what target or targets are giving the effect. Target identification, in this case based on real cellular effects instead of correlative evidence and theory, has not been avoided but only postponed. When it comes, it will be because an exciting new lead has been found from phenotype screening. Timelines will therefore be short and resources will need to be poured into it. It will be a far from trivial effort and may even call for more biologists than a small company has available. Additionally, chemists will probably be needed early on. This could be for several reasons. The initial hit can often be too weak (say 50 mM) to be useful in determining the target so that a certain amount of blind optimization needs to be done up front. Structural modifications involving linkers and/or labels may need to be carried out to fish out the target protein, as discussed below. So much excitement can be generated that chemists become eager to just start making analogs. All of these cases require the commitment of at least a few chemists to a still highly speculative preproject.

Additionally, having to chemically modify the original hit so that it can be linked to a solid support isn't necessarily trivial, especially in the absence of knowledge as to what's important to target binding. A kind of preliminary SAR study may need to be done with linkers attached to various positions in the hit molecule in order to find an acceptable spot. One interesting approach is to build the linkers into the original screening library, as exemplified by recent work where the targets of a triazine hit in a zebrafish embryo morphology screen were identified as components of the 40S ribosome. 84 Another nice example of the use of affinity purification for phenotype TID has been reported by Tanaka et al., where a morphological phenotype screen revealed that a hydroxyl-containing analog of the kinase inhibitor PP gave rise to unique cellular effects, which affinity purification traced to a non-kinase target, CBR1. 95 Thus affinity purification has proven to be successful from time to time but, like every other means of TID, it's by no means universally so. It's then not surprising that many different methodologies have been developed. Quite a few of these involve using the techniques of molecular biology to express large number of proteins, exposing these to tagged or tethered small molecule hits, detecting their interaction and determining the target involved. Among these are phage display, 96 and three hybrid systems. The latter, which is normally used in yeast has also been used in mammalian systems, 97 involves linking the hit to a known ligand for a protein receptor, then using this bifunctional molecule (the \"bait\") to bring together both domains required for the activation of a reporter gene but only in the presence of the hit's target. 98 Another technique involves microarrays of cells engineered with different plasmids to overexpress various proteins. 99 Use of an appropriately labeled hit allows for TID, although so far literature examples involved only limited subsets of potential protein targets and not genome-wide arrays. The relatively more direct method, which makes use of arrays of proteins themselves bound to a glass slide, can also be used but likewise has its limitations. 100 As has been noted for years, immobilized arrays of proteins are more difficult to make and are less stable than DNA microarrays, but in this case one potential advantage they have over some of the other identification methods mentioned is that a detection technique called surface plasmon resonance (SPR), which obviates the need for hit modification via a label or linker, can be used.",

            "text": "In theory, one of the most direct ways of finding a target for a hit acting through an unknown mechanism is to simply look at the effects on cellular proteins by observing the differences in protein expression or composition in the presence and absence of the hit molecule using 2D gels. In practice, this is anything but simple owing to many factors such as the sheer number of proteins involved, normal differences in abundance (perhaps a million fold!) and activities, isolation difficulties, experimental variability, and massive data handling. So many proteins are likely to be differentially expressed that analyzing the data often results in a \"haystack of needles.\" 101 The real target could be indistinguishable in the crowd of differentially expressed proteins, hiding in plain sight. That being said, this technique has had some successes. In one such instance, a comparison of 2D gels for an antiproliferative natural product, LAF389, showed a small shift in a protein which was traced to the incorporation of a single N-terminal methionine residue into the treated cells, suggesting that the compound was acting as an inhibitor of methionine aminopeptidases (MetAPs). 102 A major simplification of this kind of proteomic technique involves limiting the number of proteins studied to a smaller subset of gene products such as cysteine proteases or metalloproteases where appropriate activity based probes (ABPs) exist. By virtue of their target binding mechanism, which depends on activity and not abundance, another obfuscating factor is eschewed as well. 103 The relevance of this kind of strategy is probably limited to cases where the gene family of interest has been targeted by a directed library in the first place and even then it couldn't rule out effects on the other, non-family targets per se. But within these tight constraints it's a powerful method for identifying targets.",

            "text": "Another approach would be not to use transcriptomics or proteomics per se, but to do a direct comparison of growth inhibitory values in some or all of the NCI-60 cell lines with those of known drugs using the online program COMPARE. As its name implies, drugs acting through the same mechanism tend to display similar profiles here. 105 shows part of a profile for one anticancer drug, Vincristine, with red bars to the left indicating less than average activity against that cell line, while those going to the right indicate greater than average potency in the corresponding cells. Regardless of the readout used, these signature-based approaches can provide valuable mechanistic insights, but have limited utility in identifying novel targets, which may have equally novel signatures. Still, a \"unique\" profile here is a data point well worth having. Transcriptional profiling of an unknown against a custom-built signature database is illustrated by a study in which the profiles for a small set of antibacterial compounds were obtained and used to classify the relevant MOAs for others 106 and another in which a 2036-member library of small molecules was developed and used to elucidate MOAs for 85 antiproliferative agents. 107 Such comparison of databases are not only limited to small molecule perturbogens but can also make use of profiles generated through genetic methods such as deletion mutants in yeast, as an excellent recent review of the subject points out. 108 In fact, in an ironic twist of fate, true genetic methods like gene-deletion mutants in yeast are often helpful in elucidating the targets of hits obtained through chemical genetics. Here the phenotype, not the expression profile as in the case above, is the observed variable, and collections where almost every gene product in yeast has been knocked out have been generated. 109 A mutation which mimics the phenotype induced by the hit might implicate its MOA. This is called loss of function (LOF) screening. Alternatively, a coded library of heterozygous yeast mutants can be treated with the hit to look for mutations causing sensitization to its effects-in effect a dose-response experiment where half the \"dose\" is induced by deletion of a known gene and the other half by the small molecule, a process called haploinsufficiency profiling. 110 When this was done with Cincreasin ( Figure 5 .14), a simple small molecule identified through phenotype screening, one of the deletions conferring the greatest sensitivity was Mps1, the protein product of which has a spindle-checkpoint function. Follow-on experiments demonstrated that this was in fact the target of the hit. 111 The opposite kind of modification, making the cells less sensitive to drug which might indicate some compensatory or multidrug resistance mechanism, can also be useful. Yeast, of course, is not man, but it's a lot easier to manipulate, and the pathways involved can be very similar in both. 112 Figure 5 .14 \u00b7 The cancer drug Vincristine and the Mps1 inhibitor Cincreasin.

This overview obviously can't do justice to the depth and subtlety of knowledge involved in each of the fields mentioned. But the complexities of the drug discovery process are such that even with a profound, in depth understanding of all of these topics, which could only be the result of much effort over many years, the researcher would still understand only a part of the drug discovery process.
