Our current understanding of the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV is therefore mostly based on data derived from studies in animal models. Although the first animal model used to study MERS-CoV pathogenesis and test potential countermeasures became available shortly after the discovery of MERS-CoV (3) , all the animal models that have been developed so far have drawbacks (4) . Because of the host restriction conferred by the binding of the MERS-CoV spike protein to its receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), small animal models that are routinely used to conduct infectious disease research are not naturally susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. Although human DPP4-transgenic mouse models have been developed, these do not completely recapitulate the disease pathology observed in humans. Nonhuman primate models recapitulate mild and moderate human disease pathology; however, practical and ethical constraints limit work with these models.",

However, viral loads were low; infectious MERS-CoV could not be isolated from any tissues positive by qRT-PCR, and the distribution of viral RNA among tissues was inconsistent from pig to pig (Figure 2 panel C). By 11 dpi, viral RNA could only be detected in the bronchial lymph node of 1 MERS-CoVinoculated pig (Figure 2 panel C); all the tissues examined from other MERS-CoV-inoculated pigs were negative by this time. Viral RNA could not be detected in any of the extrarespiratory tissues tested, such as heart, liver, spleen, kidney, adrenal gland, duodenum, ileum, transverse colon, or urinary bladder, on 4 dpi or 11 dpi (data not shown). Histologic analysis did not reveal any lesions consistent with MERS-CoV infection in any of the collected tissues, including those of the respiratory tract. We performed immunohistochemical staining with an antibody specific for MERS-CoV on tonsil, trachea, bronchial lymph node, and right and left lower lung lobe of all pigs, as well as other tissues that tested positive for viral RNA by qRT-PCR. MERS-CoV antigen could not be detected in any of these tissues.",

We inoculated pigs intranasally and intratracheally with 10 6 tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID 50 ) of MERS-CoV isolate hCoV-EMC/2012 or, for controls (mock-inoculated), with Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium. A) Mean bodyweight gain comparison between mock-inoculated and MERS-CoV-inoculated animals over time. Error bars indicate SDs. B) Mean viral loads shed from the nose and throat determined at the time points indicated by quantifying virus on nasal and throat swabs collected from MERS-CoVinoculated animals using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (11); in each run, standard dilutions of a titered virus stock were run in parallel to calculate TCID 50 equivalents. Error bars indicate SDs. C) Viral loads in tissues collected from MERS-CoV-inoculated animals on days 4 (closed blue circles) and 11 (open red circles) postinoculation. Viral loads were determined as in panel B. Vertical bars indicate means. D) Serum samples collected from pigs at the time of euthanasia (days 4 and 11 postinoculation) and tested for MERS-CoV antibodies by using an ELISA for MERS-CoV spike 1 protein. Antibody titers are plotted as the reciprocal of the last serum dilution positive by ELISA. Horizontal bars indicate means. LN, lymph node.",
