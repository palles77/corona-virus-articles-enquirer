Feces are usually loose to watery and they may contain mucus or blood. Younger dogs are more severely affected.

Sequence analysis revealed a highly divergent N-terminal domain of the S protein, 6 amino acids longer with regards to the reference strains, with the insertions being unique to ED/99/08/IIa/GR. The unique residues were found in positions 69-70 (N, I), 147-148 (P, S), and 387-390 (T, L, I, E) of the S protein (Fig. 3) . According to the phylogenetic analysis result, the CCoV-IIa strains segregated with CB/05, with the exception of ED/99/08/IIa/GR, that formed a unique clade, within the cluster of CCoV-IIa and FCoV-II (Fig. 4) .",

Puppies usually become susceptible after the decline of the maternally derived antibodies, which last for a period of 4-5 weeks (Appel, 1987) . In contrast, older animals appear to be less susceptible, due to acquired immunity, occurring as a result of prior exposure to the pathogen. In the present study, the oldest animal tested positive was a 12 year old dog. The results indicate that CCoV is more wide-spread in puppies, though older animals can also be presented with a coronaviral infection.",

However, in the present study some of the strains were either detected (2/206) or characterized (2/134 CCoV-I, 7/134 CCoV-II) only by RT-PCR assays, which may be explained by the fact that the assays amplify different parts of the genome. Since coronavirus mutation rates are considered to be high due to the infidelity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Woo et al., 2009) , false-negative results are expected, when either primers or probes lack the ability to anneal. It is obvious that the results may be more reliable by using both assays, since no assay has been demonstrated to represent the gold standard for the identification and characterization of CCoV.",

If this is the case, the genome of CCoV-IIa is being subjected to the evolutionary pressure of the host immune system for a shorter period of time, with respect to the CCoV-I genome. This fact makes tempting to assume that the higher homogeneity of the CCoV-IIa strains' genome may be attributed to the shorter circulation time, with respect to strains of type I.

            "text": "From the results of this study, it can be concluded that CCoV infection is widespread in Greece, especially in young puppies and dogs housed in groups, presenting with diarrhea. Mixed infections prevail among CCoV infections, with the triple (CCoV-I/IIa/ IIb) infections being reported for the first time. Sequence analysis of different strains revealed high variability among CCoV-I strains at the 5' end of the S gene. In addition, the identification of a divergent strain is reported. The circulation of CCoV-I highly variable and TGEV-like emerging strains, as well as the detection of divergent strains, raise significant concerns over the spread of the strains in dogs. To date, vaccination against CCoV is considered a controversial issue, depending heavily upon the population at risk. Further research on the pathogenicity could inform on the possible need for wider cross-reactive prophylactic vaccines.",
