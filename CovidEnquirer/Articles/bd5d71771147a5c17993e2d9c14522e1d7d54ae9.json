            "text": "Neonates, especially premature neonates, requiring intensive care support constitute a highly vulnerable population at extreme risk for nosocomial or health care-associated infections. It has been estimated that as many as 6% to 22% of infants who survive 48 or more hours in a high-risk nursery or neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) acquire a nosocomial infection.\"* Although nosocomial infections have long been recognized in NICUs, only recently have data on rates been documented in the literature. As technology and treatments have advanced to significantly diminish mortality and morbidity among critically ill neonates, especially infants of very low birth weight (less than 1500 g), this vulnerability has only increased, as a result of both more profound immune system immaturity and more frequent use of invasive interventions that bypass skin and mucous membrane barriers. ' Nosocomial infections in neonates carry high attendant morbidity and mortality and health care costs. Prevention and control of these infections, although highly desirable, present a formidable challenge to health care professionals. Because control over birth weight-the most significant predictor of nosocomial infection risk-is limited, proper NICU customs, environment, and procedures (e.g., hand hygiene, antimicrobial usage, catheter-related practices, skin and cord care, visitation policies, unit design, and staffing) can reduce the risk for infection in the NICU. Understanding the epidemiology of nosocomial infections in neonates and methods for their prevention and control is critical to minimizing poor outcomes. This chapter describes the epidemiology, etiology, and clinical characteristics of neonatal nosocomial infections as well as the methods required for effective infection prevention and control.",

The lineages of the cells that will develop into the immune system are present at the beginning of the second trimester. The major components of the neonatal immune system, including T cells, neutrophils, monocytes, and the complement pathways, are functionally impaired, however, when compared with those in older infants and adults. For example, neonatal neutrophils show decreased chemotaxis, diminished adherence to the endothelium, and impaired phagocyto~is~~~; neonatal complement levels and opsonic capacity also are reduced, particularly in the premature ne0nate.4'~ In addition, neonatal T cell lymphokine production, cytotoxicity, delayed-type hypersensitivity, and help for B cell differentiation all are inferior when measured against those in adults! Antigenic naivete may account for many of these differences; however, inherent immaturity also appears to account for certain inequities. For example, neonatal T cells are delayed in their ability to generate antigen-specific memory function after HSV infection, even in comparison with naive adult T cells. ' Passively acquired maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG) is the sole source of neonatal IgG. Soon after birth, maternal IgG levels begin to fall; weeks later, production of immunoglobulins by the neonate commences. Neonatal IgG levels reach about 60% of adult levels by 1 year of age.6 Unfortunately, because much of the maternal IgG is not transferred to the infant until the last 8 to10 weeks' gestation, premature infants start with significantly lower levels of serum IgG than in their term counterparts, which persist throughout most of the first months of life.",

This process of colonization with normal flora is disrupted in infants cared for in an NICU in part because of exposure to the NICU environment, the hands of health care workers (HCWs), antimicrobial agents, and invasive procedures. As a result, the microflora of infants in the NICU can be markedly different from that of healthy term infantsEs9 Multiple antimicrobial agent-resistant CoNS, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Citrobacter species colonize the skin and the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of a high proportion of NICU neonates by the second week of hospitali~ation.'~-'~ In addition, neonates in the NICU become colonized not only with Candida albicans but also with non-albicans Candida species and Malasse~ia.'~-' ' Because colonization of the neonate with pathogenic organisms is a prelude to invasive infection from the same pathogens? measures to prevent such colonization need to be considered.

Infections that are manifested in the first few days of life, however, usually are caused by pathogens transmitted vertically from the maternal genital tract. Unfortunately, no precise time point perfectly distinguishes maternally acquired neonatal infections from those transmitted within the NICU. NNIS has attempted to address this issue by stratifying infections according to whether they are likely to be maternally acquired.20 In 89% of neonates who had an infection thought to be maternally acquired, onset occurred within 48 hours of birth. Use of a cutoff period of 48 hours or less to designate maternally acquired infections allowed 15.3% of bacteremias and 14.5% of pneumonias to be considered as originating from a maternal source. Maternally acquired bloodstream infections were more likely to be caused by group B streptococci, other streptococci, and Escherichia coli, whereas those not maternally acquired usually were caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci.20",

Specific microorganisms can be spread by more than one mechanism; in most instances, however, a single mode of spread predominates. The CDC has developed a system of precautions for the control of nosocomial infections that is based on these modes of transmi~sion.~~ Contact transmission of bacteria, viruses, and fungi on the hands of HCWs is arguably the most important yet seemingly preventable means of transmission of nosocomial infection. Spread of infection by this means can occur either by transmission of the HCW's own colonizing or infecting pathogens or, more often, by transmission of pathogens from one patient to another. That the hands of HCWs become contaminated even in touching intact skin of patients has been well demonstrated.'* Poor compliance with hand hygiene is another means by which the hands of HCWs can spread organisms from one patient to another.26227 Furthermore, hands of HCWs have been implicated in multiple outbreaks with a variety of different organisms; through experimental studies, a causal link between hand hygiene and nosocomial infection has been established.28",

Studies suggesting linen as a source of infection often have failed to confirm it as the source of infection.234 At least one report, however, has implicated linen in the transmission of group A streptoco~ci.~~ Investigation of this outbreak revealed that clothing worn by the neonates was being washed in the local hospital \"mini laundry,\" rather than being processed under the usual laundry contract. Investigation of the dryers revealed extensive contamination with the outbreak organism. This case illustrates the importance of having standard hospital laundry protocols and ensuring that appropriate water and dryer temperatures are maintained. When such protocols are followed, the mechanical actions of washing and rinsing, combined with hot water and/or the addition of chemicals such as chlorine bleach, and a final commercial dryer and/or ironing step significantly reduce bacterial Few hospitals in the United States use cloth diapers, but regardless of type used, soiled diapers should be carefully bagged in plastic and removed from the unit every 8 hours.216",

Educating HCWs about infection control principles is crucial to preventing such transmission. Hospitals should provide education about infection control policies, procedures, and guidelines to staff in all job categories during new employee orientation and on a regular basis throughout employment. The content of this education should include hand hygiene, principles of infection control, the importance of individual responsibility for infection control, and the importance of collaborating with the infection control department in monitoring and investigating potentially harmful infectious exposures and outbreaks. Transmission of infectious organisms between patients and HCWs has been well documented. Several studies have indicated that a high proportion of HCWs acquire RSV (34% to 56%) when working with infected children, and these workers appear to be important in the spread of the illness within hospital^.^^'.^^^ Although 82% of the infected HCWs in one of these RSV studies were asymptomatic, staff should be aware of the importance of self-screening for communicable disease. They should be encouraged to report personal infectious illnesses to supervisors, who in turn should report them to occupational health services and infection control. In general, HCWs with respiratory, cutaneous, mucocutaneous, or gastrointestinal infections should not deliver direct patient care to neonates.2I6 In addition, seronegative staff members exposed to illnesses, such as varicella and measles, should not work during the contagious portion of the incubation period. 232 Staff members with HSV infection rarely have been implicated in transmission of the virus to infants and thus do not need to be routinely excluded from direct patient care. Those with herpes labialis or cold sores should be instructed to cover the lesions and not to touch their lesions, and to comply with hand hygiene policies. Persons with genital lesions also are unlikely t o transmit HSV so long as hand hygiene policies are followed. However, HCWs who are unlikely or unable to comply with the infection control measures and those with herpetic whitlow should not deliver direct patient care to neonates until lesions have healed. 240 Acquisition of CMV often is a concern of pregnant HCWs because of the potential effect on the fetus. Approximately 1% of newborn infants in most nurseries and a higher percentage of older children (up to 70% of children 1 to 3 years of age in child-care centers) excrete CMV without clinical manifestation^.'^^ The risk of acquiring CMV infection has not been shown to be higher for HCWs than for the general For this reason, pregnant caregivers need not be excluded from the care of neonates suspected to be shedding CMV.

Mothers who are hepatitis B surface antigen positive may breast-feed, because ingestion of an infected mother's milk has not been shown to increase the risk of transmission to her child, but the infant must receive hepatitis B virus immune globulin (HBIG) and vaccine immediately after birth. 248 Because systemic disease may develop in preterm infants with low concentrations of transplacentally acquired antibodies to CMV following ingestion of milk of CMV-seropositive mothers, decisions regarding breast-feeding should consider the benefits of human milk versus the risk of CMV transmission. Freezing breast milk has been shown to decrease viral titers but does not eliminate CMV; pasteurization of human milk can inactivate CMV. Either method may be considered in attempts to decrease risk of transmission for breast-feeding NICU neonates. 249 Neonates in the NICU frequently are incapable of breastfeeding because of maternal separation, unstable respiratory status, and immaturity of the sucking reflex. For these reasons, mothers of such infants must use a breast pump to coUect milk for administration through a feeding tube. Pumping, collection, and storage of breast milk create opportunities for contamination of the milk, and for cross-infection if equipment is shared between mothers. Several studies have demonstrated contamination of breast pumps, contamination of expressed milk that had been frozen and thawed, and higher levels of stool colonization with aerobic bacteria in infants fed precollected breast milk. 16,250 *251 Consensus is lacking on the safe level of microbiologic contamination of breast milk, and most expressed breast milk contains normal skin flora. Although breast milk containing greater than 100 CFU/mL of gram-negative bacteria has been reported to cause feeding intolerance and to be associated with suspected sepsis, routine bacterial culturing of expressed breast milk is not recommended.249v250 Instead, efforts to ensure safety of expressed milk should focus on optimal collection, storage, and administration techniques. Cleaning and disinfection of breast pumps should be included in educational material provided to nursing mothers (Table  35-9 ). In addition, mothers should be instructed to perform hand hygiene and cleanse nipples with cotton and plain water before expressing milk in sterile containers. 1923249 Expressed breast milk can be refrigerated for up to 48 hours and can be safely frozen (-20\" C f 2\u00b0C [-4\" F f 3.6\" F]) for up to 6 months.192 It can be thawed quickly under warm running water (avoiding contamination with tap water) or gradually in a refrigerator.

If not performed carefully, bathing actually can be detrimental to the infant, resulting in hypothermia, increased crying with resulting increases in oxygen consumption, respiratory distress, and instability of vital signs.257 Although the initial bath or cleansing should be delayed until the neonate's temperature has been stable for several hours, removing blood and drying the skin immediately after delivery may remove potentially infectious microorganisms such as hepatitis B virus, HSV, and HIV, minimizing risk to the neonate from maternal infection.249 When the newborn requires an intramuscular injection in the delivery room, infection sites should be cleansed with alcohol to prevent transmission of organisms that may be present in maternal blood and body For routine bathing in the first few weeks of life, plain warm water should be used. This is especially important for preterm infants, as well as full-term infants with barrier compromise such as abrasions or dermatitis. If a soap is necessary for heavily soiled areas, a mild pH-neutral product without additives should be used, and duration of soaping should be restricted to less than 5 minutes no more than three times per week. 257 Few randomized studies comparing cord care regimens and infection rates have been performed, and consensus has not been reached on best practice regarding care of the umbilical cord stump. A review published in 2003 described care regimens used for more than 2 decades, including combinations of triple dye, chlorhexidine, 70% alcohol, bacitracin, hexachlorophene, povidone-iodine, and \"dry care\" (soap and water cleansing of soiled periumbilical skin) and found variable impact on colonization of the stump.258 The study authors suggested that dry cord care alone may be insufficient and that chlorhexidine seemed to be a favorable antiseptic choice for cord care because of its activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. They went on to stress, however, that large, well-designed studies were required before firm conclusions could be drawn. The current Perinatal Guidelines do not recommend a specific regimen but warn that use of alcohol alone is not an effective method of preventing umbilical cord colonization and ~mphalitis.'~~ The Perinatal Guidelines further recommend that diapers be folded away from and below the stump and that emollients not be applied to the",

Educate HCWs who insert and maintain catheters, and assess their knowledge and competence periodically. Use aseptic technique and maximal sterile barriers during insertion of CVCs (cap, mask, sterile gown, sterile gloves, and a large sterile barrier). Do not routinely replace CVCs, PICCs, or pulmonary artery catheters to prevent catheter-related infections. Do not remove on the basis of fever alone. In pediatric patients, leave peripheral venous catheters in place until intravenous therapy is completed unless a complication (e.g., phlebitis, infiltration) occurs. Remove intravascular catheters promptly when no longer essential. Observe proper hand hygiene procedures either by washing with antiseptic-containing soap and water or use of waterless alcohol-based products before and after working with intravascular lines. Disinfect skin with an appropriate antiseptic before catheter insertion and during dressing changes. A 2% chlorhexidine-based preparation is preferred. Do not use topical antibiotic ointment or creams on insertion sites, except when using dialysis catheters. Use either sterile gauze or sterile, transparent, semipermeable dressing to cover t h e catheter site. Replace gauze dressings on short-term CVC sites every 2 days and transparent dressings at least weekly, except in pediatric patients, in whom the risk of dislodging the catheter outweighs the benefit of changing the dressing. Change if damp, loosened, or visibly soiled. Replace dressings on tunneled or implanted CVC sites no more than once per week until the insertion site has healed. Chlorhexidine sponge dressings are contraindicated in neonates younger than 7 days or those born at a gestational age of less than 26 weeks. Clean injection ports with 70% alcohol or an iodophor before accessing the system. Use disposable transducer assemblies with peripheral arterial catheters and pressure monitoring devices. Keep all components of such systems sterile, and do not administer dextrose-containing solutions or parenteral nutrition fluids through them. from NNIS (August 2003) revealed that the mean umbilical catheter-and CVC-associated bloodstream infection rates for NICUs ranged from 10.6 per 1000 catheter days for infants whose birth weight was less than 1000 g to 3.7 per 1000 catheter days in infants whose birth weight was 2500 g or more.'94 The CDC recommends implementing strategies to reduce the incidence of such infections that strike a balance between patient safety and cost-effectiveness. Few large studies of risks related to intravascular devices have been performed in NICU patients. As a result, intravascular device recommendations for neonates are based on those developed for adults and older pediatric patients (Table 35-1 1) . Several differences in their management should be considered. Although the CDC recommends, in certain circumstances, using antimicrobialor antiseptic-impregnated CVCs in adults whose catheters are expected to remain in place more than 5 days,36 these catheters are not available in sizes small enough for neonates. Of more importance, studies to evaluate their safety in neonates, especially premature neonates of very low birth weight, have not been performed. In addition, although the CDC recommends changing the insertion site of PIVs at least every 72 to 96 hours in adults, data suggest that leaving PIVs in place in pediatric patients does not increase the risk of complications. 262 The 2002 CDC guidelines recommend that PIVs be left in place in children until therapy is completed, unless complications occur.",

Risk factors for ventilator-associated pneumonia can be grouped as host-related (prematurity, low birth weight, sedation or use of paralytic agents), devicerelated (endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, orogastric or nasogastric tube placement) and factors that increase bacterial colonization of the stomach or nasopharynx (broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, antacids, or H, b l o c k e r~) . 5~,~\"~~~ Ventilator-associated pneumonia generally refers to bacterial pneumonia that develops in patients who are receiving mechanical ventilation. Aspiration and direct inoculation of bacteria are the primary routes of entry into the lower respiratory tract; the source of these organisms may be the patient's endogenous flora or transmission from other patients, staff members, or the e n~i r o n m e n t .~~'~~~ Few studies have been performed to assess the effectiveness of prevention strategies in pediatric patients. Strategies to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia in the NICU patient are therefore based primarily on studies performed in adults (Table 35-13) . Hand hygiene remains critical to the prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia, and HCWs should consistently apply the principles of standard precautions to the care of the ventilated patient, wearing gloves to handle respiratory secretions or objects contaminated by them, and changing gloves and performing hand hygiene between contacts with a contaminated body site and the respiratory tract or a respiratory tract device. Because mechanical ventilation is a significant risk factor for the development of nosocomial infection or ventilatorassociated pneumonia, weaning from ventilation and removing endotracheal tubes as soon as indication for their use ceases are key infection control strategies. As an alternative to endotracheal intubation, noninvasive nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ventilation avoids some of the common risk factors for ventilator-associated pneumonia and has been used successfully for neonate^?^^\"^^ Respiratory care equipment that comes in contact with mucous membranes of ventilated patients or that is part of the ventilator circuit should be single use (discarded after one-time use with a single patient) or be subjected to sterilization or high-level disinfection between patients. Wet heat pasteurization (processing at 76OC for 30 minutes) or chemical disinfectants can be used to achieve high-level disinfection of reusable respiratory equipment.263 Ventilator circuits should be changed no more frequently than every 48 hours, and evidence suggests that extending the length of time between changes to 7 days does not increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia.z70s271 Circuits should be monitored for accumulation of condensate and drained periodically, with care taken to avoid allowing the condensate, a potential reservoir for pathogens, to drain toward the Sterile fluids should be used for nebulization, and sterile water should be used to rinse reusable semicritical equipment and devices such as in-line medication nebulizers. 263 Basic infection control measures, such as hand hygiene and wearing gloves during suctioning and respiratory manipulation, also can reduce the risk of nosocomial pneumonia. Both open, single-use and closed, multiuse suction systems are available. If an open system is used, a sterile single-use catheter should be used each time the patient is suctioned. Closed systems, which do not need to be changed daily and can be used for up to 7 have the advantage of lower costs and decreased environmental cross-contamination258 but have not been shown to decrease the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia when compared with open systems.273v274",
