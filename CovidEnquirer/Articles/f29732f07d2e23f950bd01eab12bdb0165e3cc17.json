            "text": "Background: Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the most important pathogens that cause acute respiratory infections in children and immunocompromised adults. This work was conducted to understand the epidemiological and phylogenetic features of RSV in southern China during 2011-2016. Methods: A total of 16 024 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from patients with respiratory infections in 14 hospitals, and screened for RSV and seven other respiratory viruses using real-time PCR. Six hundred and twenty-three RSV-positive samples from 13 hospitals were further analyzed for subtypes. G gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were performed based on 46 RSV-A and 15 RSV-B strains. Results: RSV was detected in 9.5% of the 16 024 specimens, the highest among the eight respiratory viruses screened. Most of these specimens came from inpatients and children under 3 years of age. The incidence of RSV-A (9.4%) was higher than that of RSV-B (4.4%) in children (<15 years), but not in adults (0.64% vs. 0.58%). A 2-year RSV-A dominance followed by a 1-year RSV-B dominance pattern was found. The co-detection rate of RSV was 25.1%. The main prevalent genotypes were NA1, ON1, and BA9. The prevalent RSV-A genotype in 2011-2012 was NA1, close to Chongqing and Brazil, but a new Hong Kong ON1 genotype was introduced and became the prevalent genotype in Guangzhou in 2014-2015. Deduced amino acid sequence analysis confirmed the ongoing evolution and a high selection pressure of RSV-A and B strains, especially in RSV-A ON1 and NA1 genotypes. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the molecular epidemiological characteristics of RSV in patients with respiratory infections in southern China.",

In elderly and immunocompromised adults or patients with preexisting diseases, the morbidity and mortality rates have been shown to be significantly higher in RSV-infected patients (Colosia et al., 2017) .

However, data concerning the molecular epidemiological characteristics of RSV subtypes are limited, and there are few reports about the epidemiological status and genotypic characteristics of RSV prevailing in patients with acute respiratory infections (ARI) in southern China (Liu et al., 2016) . This study was, therefore, performed to investigate the presence of RSV in pediatric (<15 years) and adult (!15 years) patients with ARI in Guangzhou. Specimens were collected from ARI patients during 2011-2016 and RSV was analyzed along with seven other common respiratory viruses.

Information including demographic data, case history, symptoms, and clinical results of each patient was collected simultaneously. RSV and seven common respiratory viruses were screened: influenza virus (Flu), parainfluenza virus (PIV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human coronavirus (HCoV), human adenovirus (HADV), human rhinovirus (HRV), and human bocavirus (HBoV).",

In contrast, RSV-B was predominant in 2013 and 2016 (Chi-square = 168.19, p < 0.01; Figure RSV-A mainly circulated in winter and spring, with a peak in January to April and a lower peak in July to September ( Figure 4A ).

RSV-A was the predominant subtype in most of the months except July, when RSV-B slightly exceeded ( Figure 4C ). On analysis of the detailed monthly distribution for 2011-2016 ( Figure 5) , it was found that most of the time, RSV-A and RSV-B had dominance alternately, except for January to June in 2014, when both RSV-A and RSV-B were epidemic at a high level.

Moreover, due to N318Y, T319A, or T320S/I/P mutation, eight Guangzhou NA1 and one Guangzhou NA3 strains lost the potential N-glycosylation site at residue 318 ( Figure 8 ).

The odds ratio of hospitalized patients with RSV infection to outpatient/emergency was 4.14, indicating that RSV infection has a considerable risk of resulting in severe disease. Infants and toddlers (<3 years) not in nursery (59.5%) seemed to have the highest risk of RSV infection, and the reason may lie in the decrease in maternal protective antibodies and the increase in exposure opportunities to crowds. The monthly distribution confirmed that RSV was mainly prevalent in winter and spring, consistent with other regions (Bashir et al., 2017; Slovic et al., 2016) . The annual distribution of RSV during 2011-2016 in Guangzhou revealed high epidemic years for 2011, 2014, and 2015, with year 2015 as an epidemic peak.

In addition to this pattern, RSV-A has been reported to show an epidemic for 2-4 years followed by RSV-B for 1 year pattern, as reported in Uruguay (Arbiza et al., 2005) ; and also, an RSV-A epidemic for 4 years followed by RSV-B for 1 year pattern, as reported in Japan (Shobugawa et al., 2009 ). It appears that this is the first time such a year distribution characteristic of RSV subtypes has been reported for Guangzhou. Most of the time, RSV-A and RSV-B took dominance alternately, but in January to June 2014, both RSV-A and RSV-B were epidemic at a high level. The co-detection rate of RSV was as high as 25.1% in Guangzhou from 2011 to 2016, and 91.1% of them were double infections and 8.9% were triple infections.

No correlation was found between clinical symptoms and co-detection (p > 0.05), indicating that co-detection may not aggravate the disease or enhance the mortality of patients. However, this finding may be limited by the small sample size and the heterogeneity of co-detected viruses, and more studies will be needed to elucidate the relationships between RSV co-infection and disease severity. Of the 46 Guangzhou RSV-A strains, 29 strains belonged to genotype NA1, 15 belonged to genotype ON1, one belonged to genotype NA3, and one belonged to genotype GA5.",

According to the genetic diversity, RSV is genotyped mainly by the second highvariant region of the G protein C-terminal (HVR2) (Schobel et al., 2016) . Therefore, to better understand the phylogenetic characteristics of RSV in southern China and to gain more insight into RSV variation, we further analyzed the sequences of the G genes of the Guangzhou RSV strains. Most of the RSV-A genotypes from Guangzhou were close to Chongqing and Hong Kong strains and the RSV-B was close to a Chengdu strain. The prevalent RSV-B genotype in Guangzhou during 2011-2016 was BA9, whereas the prevalent RSV-A genotypes were more diverse. Among the 30 strains from the years 2011-2012, 29 were NA1 and one was ON1. Among the 15 strains from the years 2014-2015, 13 were ON1 and the other two were GA5 and BA9, respectively. The 2013 strain belonged to ON1. It can be seen that the NA1 genotype of RSV-A was prevalent in 2011-2012, while ON1 became the prevalent genotype in 2014-2015, which is consistent with the report of Fan et al. (2017) .",

N-glycosylation site changes were also commonly observed in Guangzhou RSV-A strains, including the loss of the 251 and 318 glycosylation sites and regain of the 237 glycosylation site in most of the NA1 strains, and the loss of the 237 glycosylation site and two single amino acid deletions in an ON1 strain GZ/2015/16.

Furthermore, because the population lacked antibody protection, the new genotype spread rapidly and caused the high incidence of RSV-A in 2014-2015 in Guangzhou. Combined with the monthly distribution by site, we believe that the epidemic peaks in Zhu Jiang Hospital and Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Diseases in 2014 reflected the prevalence of the new genotype. Although Zou et al. (2016) also investigated the evolution and transmission of RSV-A in Guangdong in 2008-2015, the present study is the first to report the introduction, evolution, and transmission of the new ON1 genotype in Guangzhou, southern China. Further studies should be conducted to reveal the mechanisms behind the emergence of new genotypes and RSV epidemic.",
