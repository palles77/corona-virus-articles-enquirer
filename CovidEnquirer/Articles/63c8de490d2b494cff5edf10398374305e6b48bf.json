In this study, a quartz crystal microbalance-based immunosensor (QCM) has been developed and its potential evaluated for the rapid and sensitive detection of both influenza A and B viruses in laboratory-cultured preparations and clinical samples. The effective limit for detection by QCM for stock preparations of both A/PR/8/34 and B/Lee/40 viruses was 1 \u00d7 10 4 pfu/mL, associated with observed frequency shifts of 30 (\u00b15) and 37 (\u00b16.5) Hz, respectively. Conjugation of 13 nm gold nanoparticles to the detecting antibody improved the mass sensitivity of the immunosensor, resulting in a 10-fold increase in sensitivity and a detection limit of 1 \u00d7 10 3 pfu/mL for both preparations, with resulting frequency shifts of 102 (\u00b111) and 115 (\u00b15) Hz, respectively. Detection of virus in nasal washes with this technique was achieved by overnight passage in MDCK cultures prior to analysis. A comparison of results obtained from 67 clinical samples using existing RT-PCR, shell vial, cell culture and ELISA methods showed that QCM techniques were comparable in sensitivity and specificity to cell culture methods.",

            "text": "The contribution of diagnostic techniques to the management of patients with viral infections has increased considerably in the last decade, led by improved technologies that allow rapid, accurate and sensitive diagnosis of viral pathogens for an increasing range of infections. Rapid diagnosis allows the prompt initiation of effective antiviral therapy, especially in immunocompromised patients. Viral culture, usually in combination with immunofluorescence, has been regarded as the gold standard for the laboratory diagnosis of respiratory viruses (Doing et al., 1998; Johnston and Siegel, 1991) . However, these tests are not rapid and their clinical value is often limited. In the case of influenza viruses, the isolation and identification by culture requires 2-14 days for the diagnosis of an illness whose duration is typically 5-7 days (Covalciuc et al., 1999) . Rapid antigen detection tests (\u22641 h) are less sensitive and sometimes less specific than culture or molecular methods but, nevertheless, can serve as a guide for appropriate treatment with antiviral agents (Storch, 2003) . PCR and real-time-PCR techniques are highly sensitive, relatively specific and more rapid than cell culture (Atmar et al., 1996; Kehl et al., 2001; Liolios et al., 2001; Templeton et al., 2004; van Elden et al., 2002) and are widely used for the diagnosis of respiratory viruses but are more complex and require highly trained personnel. False-positives can result due to the high sensitivity of the PCR amplification system (Storch, 2003; Su et al., 2003) . Accordingly, the need for rapid detection methods with high sensitivity and specificity that are easy to perform and interpret remains a research priority (Su et al., 2003) .",

Biosensors which detect interactions between viral antigens and specific antibodies (immunosensors) can be classified according to the type of transducer used in the device (Eun et al., 2002; Mecea, 2005) . Piezoelectric sensors, such as the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), detect mass changes due to molecular interactions on the surface of the transducer (Gajendragad et al., 2001; Vaughan et al., 1999) . The application of an external electrical potential to a piezoelectric material, such as quartz, produces internal mechanical stresses that induce an oscillating electric field which, in turn, initiates an acoustic wave throughout the crystal. These waves travel in a direction perpendicular to the plate surfaces (Ebato et al., 1994; Janshoff and Steinem, 2001; Mecea, 2005) . Sauerbrey (1959) first described the relationship between observed frequency decrease ( f) and deposited mass (m) on the crystal surface in air or a vacuum (Mecea, 2005; Sauerbrey, 1959; Vaughan et al., 1999) . The frequency changes observed when a liquid is passed over the QCM crystal surface are also dependent on both the density and viscosity of the solution (Kanazawa and Gordon, 1985) . QCM devices are relatively simple and convenient to use and can detect rapid, real-time responses to binding events on the crystal surface, such as antigen-antibody interactions (Lee and Chang, 2005; Park et al., 2003; Skl\u00e1dal et al., 2004; Uttenthaler et al., 1998) , and have been applied to several areas in biotechnology including clinical diagnosis (Janshoff and Steinem, 2001; Nath and Chilkoti, 2002) and environmental monitoring (Kurosawa et al., 2006) . More recently, a new approach has been described to improve the sensitivity of QCM biosensors by the use of antibodyfunctionalized nanoparticles as a mass amplification probe for a QCM sensor, resulting in significant enhancement of sensitivity (Chu et al., 2006) .",

These curves describe the relationship between the frequency shift and the titer of the influenza virus suspension injected on to the sensor. When these data are plotted on a logarithmic-linear scale, an apparent linear relationship between amount of antigen and frequency shift was observed. A similar relationship was observed when nanoparticle-conjugated antibodies were used instead of antibody alone. Based on this apparent linear semi-logarithmic relationship between frequency shift and virus concentration, and with the use of nanoparticle-antibody conjugates, it should be possible to use this calibration curve to determine unknown viral titers for samples stored under optimal conditions within the range 10 3 -10 7 pfu/mL (Fig. 3) .",

The QCM technique developed in this study was shown to be as sensitive as the shell vial method. The NP-QCM technique was more sensitive than the shell vial method and equally as sensitive as cell culture (Table 2) , but required an additional step involving the use of a secondary nanoparticle-antibody conjugate. Direct detection of the virus from the nasal wash samples by QCM was not possible because of significant frequency fluctuations that occurred, possibly due to the viscosity of the samples. The heterogeneous nature of clinical samples appears to be an inherent limitation for diagnostic tests utilising piezoelectric immunosensors (Wu et al., 2005) . Attempts to reduce the viscosity of the nasal wash samples of infected patients by centrifugation or microfiltration prior to analysis on our immunosensor proved unsuccessful (data not shown). However, Zuo et al. (2004) overcame this limitation by the atomisation of sputum samples containing SARS-CoV by ultrasonication prior to adsorption and detection on the immunosensor. In this initial study, an additional overnight culture step was used to overcome the viscosity effects of sputum samples resulting in an increased processing time of 2 days.",
