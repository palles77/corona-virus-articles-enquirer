Human collagen type III (hCOL3A1) belongs to the fibril-forming collagens and is widely distributed in extensible connective tissue like skin, internal organs, or the vascular system. It plays key roles in wound healing, collagen fibrillogenesis, and normal cardiovascular development in human. The charged residues are considered to be an important characteristic of hCOL3A1, especially for collagen binding and recognition. Here we found that a triple helix fragment of hCOL3A1, Gly489-Gly510, contained multiple charged residues, as well as representative Glu-Lys-Gly and Glu-Arg-Gly charged triplets. We solved the crystal structure of this new fragment to a high-resolution of 1.50 \u00c5 and identified some important conformations of this new triple-helix region, including strong hydrogen bonds in interchain and interhelical interactions in addition to obvious flexible bending for the triple helix. We also found that the synthetic collagen peptides around this region exhibited potent activities through integrin-mediated peptide-membrane interaction. We then developed a method to produce a recombinant protein consisting of 16 tandem repeats of the triple-helix fragment of hCOL3A1 with strong activity without cytotoxicity. These results provide a strong base for further functional studies of human collagen type III and the method developed in this study can be applied to produce hCOL3A1-derived proteins or other tandem-repeat proteins with membrane adhesion activity.",

It participates in the formation of many tissues, such as tendons, ligaments, skin, cornea, and bone. In human, at least 28 different types of collagen can be classified as fibril-forming collagens (Type I, II, III, V, and XI) and non-fibrillar collagens [1] . Collagens self-associate to form supramolecular arrangements for various functions in different tissues, such as cell adhesion, cell membrane repair, signaling, migration, and maturation [2] . Collagen is also involved with host-defense proteins, including C1q, collectins, and macrophage scavenger receptors [3] . In fibril-forming collagens, the triple-helix conformation of collagen is formed by three polypeptide chains, with glycine repeated at every third position.",

It was found to be important in wound healing, collagen I fibrillogenesis, and normal cardiovascular development in human [4] . Besides the common proline and its post-translational modified 4-hydroxyproline (4-Hyp, \"O\" for short), multiple charged residues occurred at the X and Y positions of hCOL3A1, forming Glu-Lys-Gly, Glu-Arg-Gly or other charged triplets. These charged residues are considered to be an important characteristic of hCOL3A1, especially for collagen binding and recognition [5] . Several peptidic structures in the triple-helix region of hCOL3A1 have been solved, using host-guest peptides (host peptide stands for POG or Pro-hydroxyproline-Gly) [6] or native peptides [7] . Here we noticed that a triple-helix fragment of human type III collagen, Gly489-Gly510, contains multiple charged residues and both Glu-Lys-Gly and Glu-Arg-Gly triplets. Then we solved the crystal structure of this new region to a resolution of 1.50 \u00c5. Our findings reveal some important conformations of triple-helix region in hCOL3A1 at high resolution.

Before crystallization screening, the peptide powder was dissolved in double-distilled water to a concentration of 15 mg/ml. Crystal screening was performed at 16 C using hanging-drop vapor diffusion. The drops were set on a siliconized cover clip by equilibrating a mixture containing 1 ml protein solution (15 mg/ml C3Pa in water) and 1 ml reservoir solution (30% (w/v) PEG 400, 0.1 M Na Acetate pH 4.6, 0.1 M Cadmium Chloride) against a 1000 ml reservoir solution. After one week, single crystals formed and were flash frozen by liquid nitrogen for future data collection. C3Pb peptide was crystallized in a similar way with a different reservoir solution (0.2 M NaCl, 0.1 M Bis-Tris pH 6.5, 25% (w/v) PEG 3350).",

The asymmetric unit of both C3Pa and C3Pb contains one triple-helix molecule. Since four amino acids ( 498 GIPG 501 ) are overlapped in C3Pa and C3Pb peptides, we could build the structure from Gly 489 (involving one Gly residue in host peptide) to Gly510 of hCOL3A1 ( Fig. 1B and C) .",

In particular, the charged residues of Lys, Arg, Glu or Asp in the triple-helix region of collagen have been reported to be key residues in collagen recognition [18] . Charged residues are asymmetrically distributed along the collagen triple helix in human type III collagen, forming Glu-Lys-Gly or Glu-Arg-Gly triplets. Glu-Lys-Gly triplet has been reported to be the ligand-binding site of the macrophage scavenger receptor, and Glu-Arg-Gly triplet was found to be the integrin-binding site on collagen [5] . The Gly489-Gly510 region, containing both two kinds of triplets, may be an active triple helical site in hCOL3A1 and play an important role in cell adhesion and ligand reorganization. We selected two peptides from other triple-helix region of hCOL3A1 (Fig. 4A) , both lacking Glu-Lys-Gly and Glu-Arg-Gly triplets, then found that they exhibited much weaker cell adhesion activities than C1P peptides containing Gly489-Gly510 region (Fig. 4C) . So the potent cell adhesion activity of C1P peptide is closely related to its sequence composition. Juming et al. has reported that the recombinant collagen-like proteins containing tandem repeats of the type I collagen peptide shows high cell adhesion activities [19] . Using similar approach, we constructed a recombinant collagen protein T16, which consists of 16 tandem repeats of the triple-helix fragment of hCOL3A1, C1P peptide. As expected, T16 showed stronger cell adhesion activity than C1P peptide under same mass concentration (Fig. 4B ). It suggested that the recombinant protein containing multiple tandem repeats of the triple-helix fragment may have more stable helical conformation or more favorable ligand binding configuration to facilitate the cell membrane attachment and adhesion.",

            "text": "The model peptide Pro-Hyp-Gly (POG) is the most stabilizing sequence found in collagen, and it has been studied extensively for structure, stability and dynamic changes [20] . The crystal structure of (POG) n repeating peptides showed a linear structure of the triple helix [21, 22] , seems to indicate that the triple helix of collagen is a rigid rod-like conformation with little flexibility. However, a recent study using analytical ultracentrifugation and small-angle X-ray scattering to analyze a series of (POG) n repeating peptides found that a small degree of nonlinearity exists in these triple helices with the degree of bending approximated as 4e17 from linearity [23] . Therefore, in addition to the interruptions in the Gly-X-Y repeat, the regular Gly-X-Y repeated collagen could also have a certain degree of flexibility. This flexible bending of the collagen triple helix is hard to find in crystal owing to the packing pressure of crystallization. However, we observed such a certain degree of flexibility in our two structures, especially for C3Pa with a 15.12 bend. The only difference between C3Pa peptide and (POG) 10 model peptide is the guest peptide of hCOL3A1, Phe490~Gly501. Consequently, we reason that the bending which occurs in the crystal structure results from the intrinsic property of this hCOL3A1 peptide. Interestingly, the integrin-binding peptide GFOGER also showed an 8 ~9 angle between host POG peptide and guest peptide, termed as \"junctional kinking\", and this angle was increased to 16 when this peptide bound to the integrin I domain [15] . Similar bending has also been reported in some high resolution crystal structures for other imino acid poor peptide bound to its target proteins, such as (GPO) 3 GPQGLAGQRGIVGLOGQRGER(GPO) 3 with matrix metalloproteinase 1 [24] , and (GPO) 4 GPRGRT(GPO) 4 with a collagen binding protein CAN [25] . It suggests that the bending of collagen peptide can help its binding with target proteins. Therefore, the 15.12 bend of hCOL3A1 Phe490~Gly501 suggests that this triple helix region is highly flexible and may be involved in ligand reorganization, cell adhesion or other biological activities. Integrins are cell surface glycoproteins that serve as receptors for the extracellular matrix (ECM). It mediated the interaction of extracellular matrix with cell membrane. RGD peptide is a specific inhibitor of human PS2 group a subunit integrins [26] . In this study, we have shown that RGD peptide competitively inhibits the adhesion activity of C1P peptide and its derived recombinant protein T16. This suggests that the cell adhesion activity of the Gly489-Gly510 in ) and the proteins (T16, type \u2160 collagen, and 1% heat-denatured BSA) to 3T3 cells, respectively. Substrate concentrations are 0.2 mg/ml for peptides and proteins. The type I collagen was included as a reference to calculate relative cell adhesion rate. (C) Competition cell adhesion assay. The 3T3 cell -adhesion activity of T16 and C1P (200 mg/ml) was significantly decreased after RGD peptide (10 mM) binding with integrin. All peptides and proteins were compared with type I collagen without RGD. (D) Peptides and T16 did not show cytotoxicity at concentration of 1 mg/ml. Data are shown as mean \u00b1 s.d. The asterisks represent statistical differences. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001, ns P > 0.05. Student's two-tailed t-test was used for the comparisons. hCOL3A1 is mediated by human PS2 group a subunit integrin on the cell surface. However, further study on their specific interaction pattern and binding site is warranted.",
