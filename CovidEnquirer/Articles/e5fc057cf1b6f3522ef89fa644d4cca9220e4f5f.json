Diagrammatic representation of the genome profiles of pheasant origin rotavirus (155/89/LU, 175/89/LU I78,'89/LU isolates: Lane A) and of bovine rotavirus (NCDV isolate: Lane B). Losses started at 3 4 days and reached a peak at 5 8 days. Stunting of survivors followed the initial mortality. Post-mortem examinations revealed abnormally distended caeca with fluid material and gas. The diagnostic ELISA tests, carried out on five samples of intestinal contents, were negative, whereas cytopathic viruses were isolated on the MA-104 cell line from the 155/89/LU, 176/89/LU and 178/89/LU samples.",
