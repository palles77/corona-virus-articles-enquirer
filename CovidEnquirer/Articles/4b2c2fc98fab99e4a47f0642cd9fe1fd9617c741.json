The generalization of treatment with oral corticosteroids and nebulized adrenaline reduced the rate of hospitalization and complications. Mortality is now very rare and the mortality rate is estimated at about 1 in 30 000 cases. 1 Physiopathology Upper airway obstruction is caused by an acute viral infection, in most cases parainfluenza types 1 and 3. 5 Other pathogens implicated include influenza virus A and B, human rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, 6 metapneumovirus and, rarely, measles virus and herpes simplex virus. When croup is caused by influenza viruses, the clinical picture is usually more severe than the clinical course caused by parainfluenza viruses. 7 Laryngeal diphtheria and croup associated with measles are now very rare in immunized children but cases and outbreaks have been reported in nonimmunized regions.",

This is usually easily diagnosed by an asymmetry of the tonsillar pillars. The affected side is asymmetrically enlarged and protrudes anteriorly into the mouth. Many other agents may be indistinguishable clinically from streptococcal pharyngitis (Box 25-2). Coxsackieviruses often cause ulcers in the posterior pharynx along with a sore throat. Measles can cause a severe pharyngitis, but the associated symptoms of conjunctivitis, rash and Koplik's spots make the disease easily diagnosable. Parainfluenza and influenza viruses can give a painful pharyngitis, with frequently associated symptoms of cough and laryngitis. EBV, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus and HSV can produce significant pharyngitis. They also tend to last longer than the other viral causes of pharyngitis. These viruses produce other upper respiratory symptoms such as nontender cervical adenopathy, or in the case of HSV, tongue and mouth ulcers. HSV pharyngitis has been described as a disease in which 'the gums swell up and swallow the teeth' (Figure 25-6 ). Acute HIV infection ('seroconversion illness') may cause symptoms in up to 50% of patients. It is a mononucleosis-like illness in which pharyngitis is a prominent feature (see Chapter 93). Corynebacterium diphtheriae causes diphtheria, which is easily diagnosed because of the gray pseudomembrane in the posterior pharynx along with pharyngitis ( Figure  25-7) . Arcanobacterium haemolyticum is a common cause of pharyngitis and can also cause a scarlatiniform rash. It is a cause of many non-GAS throat infections. 34 Neisseria gonorrhoeae is an important cause of pharyngitis in sexually active individuals. The appearance of the mouth and coxsackievirus ulcers occur more frequently in the posterior part of the pharynx. HSV often produces a significant gingivitis as well.",
