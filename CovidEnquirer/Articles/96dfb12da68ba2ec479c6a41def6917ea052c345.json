Although annual influenza vaccine production is a well-planned process, rapid bulk manufacture of avian influenza vaccines of unknown growth and processing characteristics may be challenging. New approaches in immunisation strategies may be required to optimise protection of immunologically unprimed individuals. 2 On Nov 2-3, 2005, WHO held a meeting to review progress in development of vaccines for pandemic influenza. Clinicians, scientists, manufacturers, and regulators presented plans for production, evaluation of safety and immunogenicity, and licensing of vaccines against pandemic influenza. Here we present a summary of discussions at the meeting.",

            "text": "Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses can be manipulated by reverse genetics to produce viruses that retain the original virus's novel surface antigens, but which are non-pathogenic and suitable for bulk production of vaccine. 3 Reverse genetics systems are well established in a number of WHO-affiliated laboratories and are reliable for the manipulation of H5N1 viruses; however, experience with other influenza subtypes is limited and may be less successful. Before release from high biocontainment, reassortant viruses derived by reverse genetics from highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses must undergo stringent safety testing. 4 Currently it can take 8-12 weeks following receipt of wild-type virus to the release of a safe reference vaccine virus to manufacturers. In some countries, guidelines governing \"genetically modified organisms\" impose additional regulation on work with viruses generated by reverse genetics. This time could be reduced substantially if regulatory authorities agree to allow release of these viruses earlier in the process. Because of intellectual property rights surrounding this technology, vaccine manufacturers may need to obtain appropriate licences in advance. To reduce delays in developing reference viruses, it is essential that avian influenza isolates from poultry and human beings are shared quickly with WHO laboratories for antigenic characterisation.",

            "text": "The European Medicines Agency and US Federal Drug Administration both recognise that approval for pandemic influenza vaccines may be granted during the early phase of an evolving pandemic. The European approach is the development of \"core dossiers\" that contain preclinical and safety data pertinent to existing influenza vaccines. Dossiers can be submitted in advance, and the strain or subtype variation added once the pandemic strain is known. Safety and immunogenicity assessments of adjuvanted or new formulations should be done during interpandemic periods. Since any fast-track approval must not compromise safety, robust postmarketing surveillance must be an integral part of licensing procedures. Following the first H5N1 outbreak among human beings in Hong Kong in 1997, 5 two doses of conventional surface-antigen H5N3 vaccine were found to be poorly immunogenic in unprimed human beings. 6 The addition of the MF59 adjuvant substantially boosted immune responses and induced cross-reactive antibodies to antigenically unrelated H5 strains. 6 A reverse genetics subunit H5N1 vaccine, based on A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1), produced by Sanofi Pasteur using their regular production process, was assessed in a randomised trial among healthy adults in the USA. Additional studies are underway in children and elderly adults. Early analysis indicates that although the vaccine was well tolerated, immune responses were induced only at higher doses, with 11%, 4%, 48%, and 67% of 117 recipients seroconverting by neutralising antibody after two doses containing 7\u00b75 \u00b5g, 15 \u00b5g, 45 \u00b5g, or 90 \u00b5g of antigen, respectively. It is clear from these data that dosesparing formulations are urgently needed.",

The clinical studies underway will provide important information to rationalise immunisation strategies for pandemic influenza, and WHO will review additional data when available in 2006. ",
