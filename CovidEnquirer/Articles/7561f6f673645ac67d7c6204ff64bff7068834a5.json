This paper aims to highlight the burden of travelrelated infections in Oman. Method: Our study is a descriptive record-based review and analysis of travel-associated diseases over a 14 year time period from 1999 to 2013. The data was sourced from the communicable disease surveillance system, and central public health laboratory results. Results: From 1999 to 2013 there were a combined total of 7022 cases of cholera, chikungunya, dengue, filariasis, leptospirosis, meningococcal infection, poliomyelitis, measles, schistosomiasis, viral hepatitis (A), typhoid and para-typhoid reported to and subsequently investigated by the Department of Communicable Diseases. Among these cases, 558 (7.9%) were attributed to travel. Fifty percent of these patients were admitted to hospitals. Conclusion: Travel-associated infections account for about 8% of notifiable infections in Oman and have low mortality rate. However, some travel-associated infections are considered as a threat to polio eradication and measles elimination programs. Furthermore, some can cause outbreaks that can overwhelm the healthcare system. \u00aa",

These variables are modified by personality, experiences and behavior; and they differ according to age, gender, culture, race, social status and education [3] . Infectious disease risks for international travelers are moving targets, as new diseases have emerged and old ones have re-emerged. The diseases that travelers come in contact with have changed. Some countries have become safer overall, but other countries are experiencing new diseases or the re-emergence of past diseases. For example, travelling to the developing world necessarily puts travellers and migrants at risk for infectious diseases, with 20%e70% of returned travellers suffering some sort of illness [4e6] .",

Traveling contributes to the global spread of infectious diseases, including novel and emerging pathogens; the global epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 was a prime example [10] . More recently, international travelers infected with novel H1N1 influenza played a major role in the rapid global spread of the virus [11] . Travelers have also carried pathogens to areas of the world where these pathogens were rare or had been eliminated. Recent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles [12] and mumps [13] in the United States have been traced to contact with persons who had traveled to locations where vaccination was less prevalent. In addition, travel and migration have contributed to recent introduction or reintroduction of vector-borne diseases in places that had been free from these diseases, such as locally acquired dengue in Florida [14] , malaria in Greece [15] and also in Great Exuma Island in the Caribbean [16] .",

Out of these 49 hospitals, there are 4 in the capital area of Muscat, which offer tertiary care services.

This was comparable to other studies where India was one of the most common countries of exposure among travel-associated infections [21, 22] . Age and sex distribution among cases in this study with male and working-aged group predominance is affected by the characteristics of the work force in Oman. Other explanations may be related to the scope and nature of activities conducted by males between 19 and 35, exposing them to infections more than females and people in childhood and older age. However, sex distribution in this study was in contrast with other studies where travelassociated infections were divided almost equally between males and females [21, 22] .",
