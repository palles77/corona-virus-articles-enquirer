The cat was humanely destroyed after developing severe respiratory distress. Necropsy examination revealed thickened nasal turbinates and soft palate, and friable redetan material within the frontal sinus, nasal cavity and nasopharynx. The lungs contained multifocal irregular friable tan nodules. Multiple lymph nodes were enlarged, friable and redetan in colour. Histopathology revealed a mature type extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP) within the frontal sinus, nasal cavity, soft palate, larynx, trachea, lungs and multiple lymph nodes. The lymph nodes and larynx also contained marked granulomatous inflammation with extensive intrahistiocytic (and lesser amounts of extracellular) lambda light chain amyloid, confirmed by electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Neoplastic cells expressed CD79a and MUM1. This is the first report of an infiltrative EMP of the feline respiratory tract with lymph node metastasis and predominantly intrahistiocytic amyloid.",

An uncommon neoplasm in cats, the majority of cases are cutaneous (Majzoub et al., 2003) , although there are rare reports of non-cutaneous EMPs, including those of sinonasal (Sch\u20ac oniger et al., 2007) , gastrointestinal (Rowland and Linke, 1994; Zikes et al., 1998) , cerebral (Greenberg et al., 2004 ), intraocular (Michau et al., 2003 , lip and gingival origin (Kyriazidou et al., 1989) . With the exception of the intracerebral and sinonasal cases, most EMPs are described as well-circumscribed, non-infiltrative masses (Majzoub et al., 2003; Greenberg et al., 2004; Sch\u20ac oniger et al., 2007) . Additionally, although primary local extracellular amyloidosis with secondary granulomatous inflammation is wellreported in plasma cell dyscrasias in animals (Rowland and Linke, 1994; Majzoub et al., 2003; Gross et al., 2005) , extensive accumulation of intrahistiocytic amyloid is unusual.",

Physical examination revealed marked submandibular lymphadenopathy, but additional diagnostic tests were initially declined by the owner. The cat showed no response to empirical treatment with prednisolone and clindamycin. Cytology of an aspirate taken from the submandibular lymph nodes 1 month after initial presentation revealed predominantly macrophages, admixed with lymphocytes, plasma cells and a few neutrophils and eosinophils. The macrophages were distended with magenta-coloured material that was amorphous and curvilinear to granular. The cytology was interpreted as inflammatory, with reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and increased numbers of plasma cells.",

The tonsils were bilaterally mottled redetan and the aryepiglottic folds and cuneiform processes of the larynx were bilaterally enlarged, slightly nodular and mottled redetan.

Sections were incubated with the following primary antibodies: mouse monoclonal antibodies against CD79a (1 in 500 dilution) and MUM1 (1 in 50 dilution) (each for 30 min), rabbit polyclonal antibodies against kappa (1 in 4,000 dilution) and lambda (1 in 12,000 dilution) light chains (each for 30 min) and canine AA (1 in 9,000 dilution; for 45 min) (Johnson et al., 1995) . Secondary detection was performed using a Dako Envision+/ HRP\u00d4 kit, and secondary antibodies were mouse anti-mouse (for CD79a and MUM1) or goat antirabbit (for SAA and both light chains) (all from Dako). Antibody binding was 'visualized' using 3,3\u02b9diaminobenzidine (DAB) as chromogen for CD79a and MUM1 and 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC) as chromogen for SAA and the light chains. Positive controls included dog tonsils (for the light chains), a known positive renal amyloid case (for SAA) and a normal feline lymph node (for CD79a and MUM1). The negative controls consisted of a mouse (CD79a and MUM1) or rabbit (SAA and light chains) IgG isotype substitution for the primary antibodies used on the case tissues.",

            "text": "This case represents an extramedullary mature type plasmacytoma involving the upper and lower respiratory tract with lymph node metastasis. The patient was a geriatric male, consistent with the higher reported incidence of EMPs in older male cats (Majzoub et al., 2003; Michau et al., 2003; Greenberg et al., 2004) . Although the majority of human EMPs reportedly arise within the upper respiratory tract (dos Anjos Corvo et al., 2013) , this is a rare location in small animals, with only a few Extramedullary Plasmacytoma in a Cat case reports describing primary laryngeal and tracheal EMPs in dogs, and one report involving the nasal cavity and frontal sinus of a cat (Chaffin et al., 1998; Weigt and McCracken, 2001; Hayes et al., 2007; Sch\u20ac oniger et al., 2007; Witham et al., 2012) . This case is unique as it describes an EMP with extensive tissue infiltration as well as metastasis. In the previously reported case of sinonasal EMP in a cat, the neoplasm was limited to the nasal cavity and frontal sinus (Sch\u20ac oniger et al., 2007) . In the case of an intracerebral EMP in a cat, the neoplasm was more infiltrative, involving the leptomeninges, ventricular system, subependymal tissue and the habenular nucleus (Greenberg et al., 2004) . However, to our knowledge, the present case is the first report of extensive infiltration by an EMP within the upper and lower respiratory tract. Severe plasmacytic inflammation may be difficult to differentiate from a mature type plasmacytoma and initial biopsy and cytology samples from this cat were suggestive of an inflammatory process rather than neoplasia. Assimilation of necropsy findings with additional diagnostic tests allowed a diagnosis of a mature type EMP. Amyloidosis may be categorized as primary (AL) or secondary (AA) depending on the pathogenesis. In domestic animals, primary amyloidosis typically develops in cases of plasma cell dyscrasias, although not all plasma cell dyscrasias result in amyloidosis. Neoplastic plasma cell populations may produce large quantities of monoclonal, complete or fragmented immunoglobulin light or heavy chains (typi-cally lambda light chain in animals). In some cases, these proteins are unstable and insoluble and form aggregates of amyloid fibrils that are unable to be degraded by macrophages. Secondary amyloidosis is more common in animals and occurs in some cases of chronic inflammatory disease. The increased levels of inflammatory cytokines (specifically interleukin [IL]-1, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor [TNF]-a) released by activated macrophages results in increased production and release of serum amyloidassociated peptide (SAA, an acute phase protein) by hepatocytes. SAA is degraded into a smaller AA protein, which is unstable, insoluble and prone to forming fibrils (amyloid). A defect in macrophage enzymes or a mutation in the SAA protein is theorized to result in amyloid accumulation, rather than the normal degradation of this acute phase protein (Snyder, 2012) .",
