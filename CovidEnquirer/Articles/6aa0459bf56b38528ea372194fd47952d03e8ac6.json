While various therapeutic options have been pursued including vaccines, 7 monoclonal antibodies, 4, 8 and recom-binant proteins, 9,10 many of these have yet to reach clinical trials and may ultimately not translate well to effective treatments that can be made readily available during an outbreak, particularly in suboptimal conditions. 11 One therapeutic option for the development of antiviral treatments is the use of nucleoside analogues. Nucleoside analogues have long been the cornerstone of antiviral therapies due to their ability to inhibit viral replication because they mimic the structure of the natural nucleosides. 12, 13 As such, they can be recognized by cellular or viral enzymes, including the viral DNA or RNA polymerases. Moreover, because they contain various structural modifications, this leads to cessation of viral replication, typically due to chain termination. 13 Various nucleoside analogues against filoviruses such as EBOV have already been proposed including S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHase) inhibitors c3Ado and c3Nep ( Fig. 1) , 14, 15 and the monophosphate derivative of BCX4430, 16 an adenosine analogue that acts as a non-obligate chain terminator, however, none of these have progressed to the clinic. Most recently GS-5734, a monophosphoramidate prodrug adenosine analogue which targets EBOV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), exhibited very potent activity against both EBOV and MARV, 17, 18 further demonstrating the potential for finding effective nucleoside inhibitors of filoviruses.",

[19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] One type of fleximer features a purine ring that is ''split\" into its imidazole and pyrimidine moieties. The two pieces remain connected by a single CAC bond, thus introducing free rotation between the two heterocyclic components without losing the necessary groups needed for recognition (Fig. 2) . 19, 20 This strategic design retains the hydrogen bonding patterns needed for recognition, while allowing the Flex-nucleoside to interact with alternative binding moieties, such as different amino acids in the binding pocket, that were previously unattainable by the parent nucleoside. 19, 20, 25 Studies within our lab have also shown that their inherent flexibility allows for an increase in bind-ing affinity compared to corresponding rigid inhibitors, as well as the ability to overcome point mutations in biologically relevant enzymatic binding sites, thus providing potential for overcoming the development of drug resistance. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] More importantly, recent work with some fleximer versions of the FDA-approved nucleoside Acyclovir, revealed significant activity against human coronaviruses Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), representing the first nucleoside analogues to exhibit low micromolar levels of anti-CoV activity. 26 This was groundbreaking since nucleoside analogues had to that point failed to show viable levels of activity against these deadly viruses. As a result, this prompted further evaluation of the Flex-analogues against other viruses, particularly given the dual anti-CoV and anti-EBOV activity recently noted by GS-5734. 17 Herein, we report the anti-filovirus activity for these analogues, as well as the corresponding phosphoramidate prodrug 3 (Fig. 2) .",

While ongoing studies have identified various therapeutics as potential EBOV treatments, there are currently no FDA approved vaccines or therapeutics, and as such, it is imperative that an effective treatment option is developed. Within this study we found that both compounds 1 and 3 exhibited antiviral activity against a recombinant reporter EBOV in Huh7 cells, though surprisingly the McGuigan prodrug was 10-fold less potent (EC 50 = 2.2 \u00b1 0.3 lM and 27.2 \u00b1 2.2 lM respectively). Against wild-type viruses in HeLa cells, compound 1 had no detectable activity, though compound 3 inhibited both EBOV and SUDV (EC 50 = 29 \u00b1 9 and 7 \u00b1 2 lM respectively). The difference in activity of 1 in the Huh7 cells compared to the HeLa cells is most likely due to a difference in specific metabolism of the compound in those cells lines, however, further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis. Efforts are currently underway to better understand the mechanism of action of these compounds and how they might interact with the viral RdRp or other viral replication enzymes. The results of those studies will be reported as they become available. ",
