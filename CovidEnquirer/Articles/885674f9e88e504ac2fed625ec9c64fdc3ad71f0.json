Protein sequencing analysis has established that this fragment is released by cleavage between residues 62 and 63 (Weinstein et al ., 1987) . It seems that the secreted form of ST is also the result of cleavage around this site . When fused to a cleavable signal sequence, an enzymatically active ST fragment from residue 58 to the COOH terminus is secreted in transfected cells .

As shown, a 100-kD protein was specifically detected in the pulse-labeled cells expressing S33D. As chase proceeded, this 1004D form was converted into a 110-kD form. This conversion was very efficient, as all newly made 100-kD molecules were converted into the 110-kD form within 90 min of chase . In cells expressing S64D, a 105-kD form was initially detected in pulse-labeled cells and this form was converted into a 115-kD form during the chase period. A majority of the 105-kD form was converted into the 115-kD form after 90 min of chase, although a small amount of the 105-kD form was still observed . Endo H treatment ofimmunoprecipitated proteins (Fig. 3 B) showed that the 100-kD form ofS33D and the 105-kD formofS64Dwere mainly converted into 80-and 85-kD polypeptides, respectively, which were of the same size as the respective polypeptides without any glycosylation (produced by in vitro translation without microsomes) . This result suggests that all the N-linked glycans (about 7-8 N-linked glycans, but no detectable 0-linked glycans, were present in the ectodomain of DPPIV [Hong and Doyle, 1988 ; Hong et al., 1989] ) attached to the 100-kD form of S33D and the 105-kD form of S64D were essentially sensitive to endo H and that they represent the newly made proteins in the ER bearing N-linked glycans of the highmannose type. The size of the 110-kD form of S33D was reduced by 4-5-kD after endo H treatment, suggesting that about two of the N-linked glycans in the polypeptide were of the high-mannose type while the remaining N-linked glycans (N5-6) were resistant to endo H.

            "text": "Localization ofS33D and S64D to the Trans-Golgi Cisternae and/or TGN The results obtained from pulse-chase and endo H treatment experiments suggest that S33D and S64D were present in the medial-and/or post-medial-Golgi cisternae . The indirect fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that they were localized in the Golgi apparatus . To further determine the compartment of their localization, their N-linked carbohydrate structures were examined by lectin affinity chromatography (Haselbeck et al ., 1990; Lis and Sharon, 1986) (Fig. 5) . Cells expressing S33D were pulse labeled with [35S]methionine followed by 30 min of chase such that both the 100-kD ER form and the 110-kD Golgi form of S33D were present in the cells . Similar amounts of labeled S33D were incubated with various lectin-agarose beads . The material bound to the beads was analyzed . As shown in Fig. 5 A, both the 100-and 11041) forms could be quantitatively recovered with Con A-agarose (mannose-binding lectin) (lane 2), consistent with the presence of N-linked glycans of high-mannose type in both 100-and 110-kD forms of S33D as concluded from the endo H experiment . The 110-but not the 100-kD form was also recovered from WGA-, Erythrina cristagalli, (ECA)-, Sambucus nigra (SNA)-, and Maackia amurensis (MAA)-agarose beads. Since ECA binds specifically to the Gal-01,4-G1cNac structure in N-linked glycans, this result demonstrates that the 110-kD form has been modified by trans-Golgi GT. SNA and MAA bind a-2,6-and a-2,3linked sialic acids, respectively. Thus the 110-kD form of S33D has been modified byboth a-2,6-and a-2,3-sialyltransferases, both of which are localized to the trans-Golgi cisternae and/or TGN . These results demonstrate that S33D had been modified by glycosyltransferases of the trans-Golgi cisternae and the TGN and suggest that it is localized to the trans-Golgi cisternae and/or TGN . WGA binds both sialic acid and N-acetylglucosamine while succinylated WGA (sWGA) binds only N-acetylglucosamine (Monsigny et al., 1979 (Monsigny et al., , 1980 . The binding of 110-kD S33D to WGA but not sWGA not only confirmed the presence of sialic acid on the N-linked glycans but also demonstrated that no N-acetylglucosamine residues were exposed on the glycans . Both the 100-and the 110-kD forms of S33D failed to bind Lotusagarose, a fucose-specific lectin . This result suggests that no significant fucose residues were added to the N-linked glycans of S33D. Similar experiments performed with cells expressing S64D (Fig . 5 B) revealed that the 115-kD Golgi form of S64D binds Con A-, WGA-, ECA-, SNA , and MAA-, but not sWGA-or Lotus-agarose (identical pattern as the 110-kD form of S33D). The 115-kD form of S64D has thus been modified by both GT and sialyltransferases . The 105-kD form of S64D was quantitatively recovered from Con (10041)) and Golgi (11041)) forms were present . Similar amounts of the immunocomplex were analyzed directly (Control) or incubated with various lectin-agaroses and the bound fraction was then analyzed . (B) Lectin-binding properties of S64D.

This observation suggests that a small fraction of the 105-kD form might have undergone modifications by 0-GT and ST, although the possibility that the observed binding of the 105-kD form of S64D to WGA, ECA, and SNA was due to nonspecific background binding could not be excluded yet . The small amount of 105-kD form present in pulse-labeled cells after 90 min of chase (Fig . 3 A, lane 5) may therefore have been transported to the Golgi apparatus .

            "text": "We have thus demonstrated that both S33D and S64D are predominantly present in the Golgi apparatus . Similar results were obtained for S51D, S46D, and S40D (data not shown) . These results demonstrate that the NHz-terminal 33-residue sequence of ST is sufficient for Golgi localization and that the stem region of ST (sequence from residue 34 to 63) is apparently not essential for Golgi localization . The sequence in this stem region is in fact the most divergent be-25 1 tween rat and human ST. The NH2-terminal 64-residue sequence ofhuman ST (Grundmann et al ., 1990) is also shown in Fig . 1 A (M) . Incontrast to the stem region, the sequence of the cytoplasmic domain is totally conserved between the rat and human ST. The transmembrane domain is also highly conserved . The sequence conservation of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains but not the stem region is consistent with our finding that the NH2-terminal 33-residue sequence of ST is sufficient for Golgi localization . This 33residue sequence can be further divided into three regions : the cytoplasmic domain, the transmembrane domain, and the 7-residue sequence flanking the COOH-terminal side of the transmembrane domain. To further narrow down the sequence required for Golgi localization, an additional five chimeric cDNAs were constructed which encode fusion proteins S26D, S9D, S10-33D, S10-26D, and S27-33D (Fig. 1  B) . In vitro translation studies demonstrated that S26D, like S27D, was not anchored in the microsomal membrane (Fig.  2) . Interestingly, S10-26D, which is identical to S26D except that the ST cytoplasmic domain was replaced by that of DPPIV, was mainly (N70%) anchored in the membrane (Fig. 2) . For S26D, S27D, and S10-26D, the translocated form in the supernatant was ofa smaller size than the translocated form in the membrane, implying that the nonanchorage in the membrane of S26D, S27D, and, to a much lesser extent, SIO-26D might be due to a cleavage of (or part of) the signal/anchor sequence ofST by the signal peptidase, although this explanation will have to be verified by future experiments . Replacing the cytoplasmic domain of ST by that of DPPIV in S10-26D significantly enhanced the membrane anchorage . In connection with the results obtained with S27D and S33D (Fig. 2) , it can be concluded that the signal/anchor sequence of ST is within its NH2-terminal 33-residue sequence, comprising the 17-residue hydrophobic core and flanking hydrophilic sequences on both sides. The nature of the hydrophilic sequences on either side of the hydrophobic core significantly affect its efficiency in acting as a signal/anchor sequence. Results similar to S33D (Fig. 3) were obtained for S9D, S10-33D, and S27-33D (data not shown) . Based on these in vitro translation results, chimeric cDNAs encoding S9D, S10-33D, S10-26D, and S27-33D (S26D was not pursued further) were inserted into the pRSN expression vector and transfected into MDCK cells. The cellular localization ofthe fusion proteins was examined by indirect fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig . 6 , intense surface staining was detected for S9D (A) and S27-33D (C), but not for S10-33D (E) or SIO-26D (G) . When the cells were permeabilized, intense intracellular staining ofperinuclear vesicular-tubular network was observed for SIO-33D (F) and S10-26D (H), typical of the Golgi apparatus . This was further confirmed by their colocalization with intracellular WGA binding sites (data not shown) . S10-26D and S10-33D have lectin-binding properties similar to those of S33D and S64D, demonstrating the modification of their N-linked glycans by GT and sialyltransferases (data not shown) . S10-26D and S10-33D thus reside in the trans-Golgi cisternae and/or TGN .",

As shown, the surface expression of S33D, S64D, S10-33D, and S10-26D was between 2 and 6 % as compared with DPPIV. The loss of surface expression demonstrates that the Golgi localization signal of ST is highly effective in targeting the fusion proteins to the Golgi apparatus.

However, the possibility that they may be initially transported to the cell surface and then rapidly and effectively endocytosed and sorted to the trans-Golgi cisternae and/or TGN could not be ruled out because only a single chase point was examined.

We thus constructed a series of chimeric cDNAs encoding fusion proteins in which the N112 -terminal ST sequence of different sizes were fused to the ectodomain of a cell surface protein DPPIV (Hong and Doyle, 1990; Ogato et al ., 1989; Low et al., 1991a,\u00f3) . When expressed in transfected MDCK cells, fusion proteins bearing NHZ-terminal 64-, 51-, 46-, 40-, and 33-residue ST sequences were all localized to the Golgi apparatus as assessed by indirect fluorescence microscopy and other biochemical methods. The results with two fusion proteins, S33D and S64D, are presented in this report . Pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that both S33D and S64D wereefficiently transported from the ER to the Golgi apparatus and have passed beyond the medial-Golgi cisternae . Affinity chromatography with several lectin-agaroses demonstrated that both S33D and S64D were extensively modified by GT and ST. Since GT has been previously localized to the trans-Golgi cisternae (Roth and Berger, 1982) and ST has been localized to the trans-Golgi cisternae and TGN (Both et al ., 1985) , these results suggest that S33D and S64D are localized in the trans-Golgi cisternae and/or the TGN . Because the actual localization of ST in MDCK cells has not been established, our conclusion for the trans-Golgi cisternae and/or TGN localization of S33D and D64D is based on the assumption that ST is localized in the same compartments in MDCK cells .",

If there was any conformational abnormality, the fusion proteins would have been retained in the ER and/or pre-Golgi compartments. Many misfolded chimeric proteins have been described and all failed to be transported beyond the cis-face of the Golgi apparatus (Rose and Doms, 1988) . Furthermore, preliminary experiments have shown that all the fusion proteins possessed similar enzymatic activity as the normal DPPIV, suggesting no global conformational change in the ectodomain of DPPIV in the chimeric proteins . Additional experiments demonstrated that the Golgi localization of the chimeric proteins by the ST transmembrane domain is a specific event, because the replacementof the transmembrane domain of DPPIV by that of another type II surface protein resulted in a chimeric protein that was transported to the cell surface (data not shown) .",

Whether the transmembrane domain of GT and/or NTI is similarly involved in Golgi localization needs further investigation . Our recent studies with NTI suggest that its transmembrane domain is indeed involved in Golgi localization (Tang et al ., 1992) . The sequence of the trans-membrane domain varies greatly between ST, GT, and NTI, and this sequence divergence of the transmembrane domain among different glycosyltransferases might be related to their distinct subcompartment localization in the Golgi apparatus. Further studies will shed more light on this issue. The Golgi localization specified by the transmembrane domain of ST could potentially be mediated by two different but related mechanisms . The membrane spanning domain may interact with specific lipid components (or specific lipid microenvironment) in the Golgi membrane . This interaction may immobilize the proteins in a particular microdomain in the membrane. Proteins in this microdomain may be specifically prevented from entry into the budding vesicles for subsequent transport. Alternatively, the transmembrane domain may interact with a specific membrane-spanning region of other proteins that are already immobilized in the Golgi membrane through unknown mechanisms. Furthermore, interaction of the transmembrane domains among different molecules of ST (self interaction) induced by the Golgi environment may also be involved . At present, we are unable to propose a detailed molecular mechanism to explain the Golgi localization mediated by the ST transmembrane domain . Future studies with point mutations in the ST transmembrane domain and other glycosyltransferases will enable us to gain more understanding about the cellular targeting mediated by the transmembrane domain .",

            "text": "During the review of this manuscript, two papers were published which demonstrated that the membrane-spanning domain of GT (Nilsson et al ., 1991) and the transmembrane domain and its flanking sequences of ST (Munro, 1991) could specify Golgi localization . Although similar conclusions were reached by Munro in his study, there were a few significant differences in the approach and results presented from our study. (a) Munro used a transient expression system in COS cells while our study was performed in stably transfected MDCK cells. (b) Our results clearly demonstrate that the 17-residue transmembrane domain itself was sufficient for Golgi localization of the chimeric protein and its flanking sequences did not contribute much to the efficiency of Golgi localization . This difference could be due to the different expression systems used and the fact that our chimeric proteins were derived from two well-defined cellular proteins of the same membrane topology while those in Munro's study involved a tripartite fusion among three proteins. (c) In addition to confirming biochemically the Golgi localization of the chimeric proteins, we also used surface biotinylation to demonstrate that the Golgi-localizedchimeric proteins were not initially transported to the cell surface followed by recycling back to the Golgi, providing the first evidence that they were selectively retained in the Golgi complex.",
