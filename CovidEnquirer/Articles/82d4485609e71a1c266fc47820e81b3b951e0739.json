            "text": "SWINE influenza virus (SIV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) and porcine reproductive-respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) are ubiquitous in swine producing areas of Europe. All three viruses are transmitted via the respiratory route and infect the pig lung, but they differ in terms of lung target cells and replication kinetics. SIV and PRCV replicate principally in lung epithelial cells and cause acute, self-limiting infections (Haesebrouck and Pensaert 1986 , O'Toole et al 1989 , Cox et al 1990 , Brown et al 1993 . PRRSV, on the other hand, has a predilection for lung alveolar macrophages, and persists in these cells during at least 3 to 4 weeks (Duan et al 1997) . The clinical importance of these infections is frequently a matter of debate. Still, critical analysis of field and experimental data indicates differences in pathogenicity between these viruses. SIV has been associated with outbreaks of fever, anorexia, tachypnoea, dyspnoea and coughing; and the typical clinical picture has been reproduced experimentally (Haesebrouck and Pensaert 1986) . PRCV or PRRSV infections on swine farms frequently pass without being noticed. Most experimental PRCV infections have remained asymptomatic (O'Toole et al 1989 , Cox et al 1990 . Similarly, after experimental inoculation of European PRRSV isolates, respiratory disease has been difficult to reproduce and a transient fever was the most consistent clinical manifestation (Paton et al 1992, Nielsen and Botner 1997) .",

Both TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1 induce a striking increase in intra-alveolar neutrophils when injected intratracheally into rats, and they exert profound stimulating effects on neutrophil and macrophage functions. IFN-\u03b1 also stimulates a variety of phagocyte functions (reviewed by Tizard 1995) . In addition, all three cytokines share systemic effects known as the 'acute phase response', such as fever, lethargy and anorexia. Severe lung inflammation and disease result in particular when cytokines occur at high levels or in combination with each other (Murtaugh et al 1996) . In experimental infections of pigs with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Asai et al 1993) or with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (Baarsch et al 1995) , lung neutrophil infiltration and pathology have been associated with TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1. As for virus infections of the pig lung, the possible involvement of cytokines is largely unexplored.",

D10(N4)M cells at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 10 4 cells per well in 100 \u00b5l RPMI with recombinant human IL-2 (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) and concanavalin A (Sigma) (final culture concentrations of 10 U ml -1 and 2 \u00b5g ml -1 respectively) were incubated with the cells during 72 hours (37\u00b0C, 5 per cent CO 2 ). Cell proliferation was measured by the thiazolyl blue (MTT) conversion procedure: 50 \u00b5l of a 3 mg ml -1 solution of MTT (Sigma) was added to the wells and further incubated during 18 h. Thereafter, 200 \u00b5l of medium was removed and 150 \u00b5l dissolving solution (0.5 per cent SDS, 36 mM HCl in isopropanol) added to each well. The resulting formazan crystals were dissolved by 15 minutes sonication in an ultrasonic water bath and ODS were read at 550 nm in a Titertek Multiskan. One unit of IL-1 was defined as the reciprocal of the dilution producing 50 per cent proliferation of D10(N4)M cells. To assign bioactivity to IL-1, monoclonal rat anti-mouse IL-1 receptor type 1 antibodies (Genzyme) were included in the assay.",

SIV, but not PRCV or PRRSV, produced acute respiratory disease, and severe lung necrosis and inflammation. Moreover, SIV symptoms and pathology could be linked with an excessive and concurrent production of IFN-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1 in the lungs. There was a strong temporal association between peak levels of these cytokines and the onset of typical flu symptoms, lung neutrophil infiltration and pathology. Individual cytokine levels as well correlated largely with clinical severities and lung pathology, as shown in our previous study (Van Reeth et al 1998) . Finally, potent synergistic interactions between IFN-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1 are known, and the 'cytokine triad' will probably exert much greater effects than the individual cytokines. Conversely, the lack of such a 'cytokine combination' during PRCV or PRRSV infection may in part explain the mild respiratory pathology and the absence of respiratory disease.",

            "text": "We found a perfect coincidence of peak SIV replication and cytokine secretion, and cytokines appeared during the very early phase of virus replication. Others have shown that influenza virus induces cultures of mononuclear cells to synthesize IFN-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1 (Nain et al 1990) . In addition, the influenza virus haemagglutinin was the first viral envelope protein that was shown to activate the transcription factor NF-kappa B, which controls gene expression of a series of (pro)inflammatory cytokines (Pahl and Baeuerle 1995) . All these data support that SIV directly stimulates lung cells to release cytokines, and that cytokines are not merely a side-effect of cellular destruction or immune activation. The fact that SIV replicates vigorously in the lung may further contribute to a strong cytokine response, for cytokine production is virus dose-dependent. PRRSV causes minimal airway epithelial damage or gross lung pathology, and as such does not behave like a 'classic' respiratory virus. On the other hand, systemic symptoms and a massive mononuclear cell infiltration of the lung have been found in our and other studies (Paton et al 1992 , Nielsen and Botner 1997 , Shibata et al 1997 . Both features possibly relate to the production of IL-1 during PRRSV infection. Localised production of IL-1 has shown to induce fever and anorexia (Hill et al 1997) , and IL-1 is one of the main stimuli for the production of monocyte-attracting chemokines (Zoja et al 1991) . Two 'monocyte chemotactic proteins' (MCPs), MCP-1 and MCP-2, have been cloned from porcine cDNA libraries (Hosang et al 1994 a, b) , but their invivo production or significance has not yet been demonstrated, nor has their significance. It is our working hypothesis that chemokines produced by PRRSV-infected AMS mediate the influx of new monocytes-macrophages, which in turn serve as targets for virus infection and sources of chemokines. In conclusion, our findings indicate that there is differential cytokine production during different respiratory virus infections. Furthermore, they strongly suggest that proinflammatory cytokines can be important mediators during viral respiratory disease. Further studies are needed to define the roles of specific cytokines in symptom formation and lung pathology. Anti-cytokine strategies in pigs are still dreams of the future, we thus have to search for alternative and creative experimental approaches.",
