However, the detailed evolutionary history and impact of tRNA modifying 15 enzymes has not been analyzed. Using ancestral reconstruction of five tRNA modifications across 16 1093 bacteria, we show that most modifications were ancestral to eubacteria, but were repeatedly 17 lost in many lineages. Most modification losses coincided with evolutionary shifts in non-target 18 tRNAs, often driven by increased bias in genomic GC and associated codon use, or by genome 19 reduction. In turn, the loss of tRNA modifications stabilized otherwise highly dynamic tRNA gene 20 repertoires. Our work thus traces the complex history of bacterial tRNA modifications, providing 21 the first clear evidence for their role in the evolution of bacterial translation. 22 23",

Moreover, a phylogenetic regression to test the impact of GC and MEs on 8 tRNA genes revealed that GC content had the strongest impact on the dynamics of non-target tRNA 9 genes (Fig. 7) .

Each search generated a table with accession numbers of potential homologous hits with 15 a corresponding e-value and bit-score. There is no consensus in the field with respect to setting an 16 e-value cut-off to detect true homologs. Here, we present a slightly informative method of deciding 17 e-value cut-offs for detecting true homologs. To infer presence/absence with precision, we 18 implemented a dynamic e-value cut-off to eliminate spurious hits. We did this by plotting the 19 number of species in which the ME would be detected as we increased the e-value cut-off (Fig. S6) . 20 We observed stable plateaus where the number of species in which an ME was detected did not 21 change despite changing the e-value cut-off, suggesting that these represent robust e-value 22 thresholds. Thus, for each enzyme we set an enzyme-specific e-value cut-off as the first e-value at 23 the beginning of the most stable plateau (see Fig. S6 ). For each ME, homologous hits that had e-24 values lower than this cut-off were considered true homologues. However, in our initial analysis we did not find CmoA and CmoB homologs in these or related 28 species. A closer inspection of the Bacillus subtilis genome also did not reveal these enzymes, as 29 indicated in a previous report (Grosjean et al., 2014) . Instead, there were a few entries for these 30 enzymes in the UniProt database (each with a poor annotation score). We therefore tested whether 31 these enzymes are true homologs of the proteobacterial CmoA and CmoB, using homology 32 detection (using 'jackhmmer').

A survey of the SEED database (Overbeek et al., 2005 ) also 1 revealed the absence of CmoA and CmoB in all but one Bacillus species. When we carried out a 2 blastp analysis using CmoA and CmoB enzymes from Escherichia coli in Mycobacterium bovis str. 3 BCG, we observed no significant hits for CmoA and no hits for CmoB with e-values < 5e-3.

Base modifications are carried out by several tRNA modifying 9 enzyme (ME) pathways, modifying the wobble position of a large fraction (42%) of all tRNA 10 species (Boccaletto et al., 2018; Grosjean et al., 2010; Machnicka, Olchowik, Grosjean, & Bujnicki, 11 2015). Given their potential impact on the effective tRNA pool and on translation dynamics, MEs 12 should generally face strong selection, especially in species with a restricted tRNA repertoire. 13 Indeed, in several bacteria, deleting modifying enzymes is lethal or otherwise deleterious for growth 14 and translation (Bj\u00f6rk & Hagervall, 2014; Gao et al., 2016; Shippy, Eakley, Lauhon, Bochsler, & 15 Fadl, 2013; Wolf, Gerber, & Keller, 2002). However, in some cases MEs do not appear to be 16 essential (Noguchi, Nishimura, Hirota, & Nishimura, 1982), suggesting strong yet variable 17 evolutionary impact of tRNA modifications. Recently, Novoa and colleagues showed that MEs 18 unique to the three kingdoms of life have shaped kingdom-specific tRNA pools (Novoa, Pavon-19 Eternod, Pan, & Ribas De Pouplana, 2012). However, the detailed evolutionary history of diverse 20 bacterial tRNA modifications and their impact on key components of bacterial translation remain 21 unclear. 22",

            "text": "years ago, Francis Crick described the phenomenon of wobble base pairing where one 20 tRNA molecule can recognize multiple codons (Crick, 1966). Since then, a large body of work has 21 developed a detailed understanding of the enzymatic pathways that generate extended wobble 22 pairing via base modifications of tRNA anticodons (reviewed in (Bj\u00f6rk & Hagervall, 2014)). Given 23 their critical role in translation, modifying enzymes are expected to evolve under strong selection, 24 and in turn influence the evolution of other components of the translation machinery (Grosjean et 25 al., 2010). Here, we trace the evolutionary history of tRNA modifications across the bacterial 26 phylogeny, showing that the eubacterial ancestor already had nearly all known modification 27 pathways. Several major bacterial clades subsequently lost the modifications, often accompanied by 28 increasing tRNA diversity and shifts in genome GC content and codon use. These results are 29 consistent with the hypothesis that an expanded tRNA pool gradually weakens selection on MEs, 30 allowing their loss through drift. However, once the modification is lost, bacteria likely face strong 31 selection to retain the expanded tRNA pool. In contrast, if GC shifts shrink the tRNA gene pool, 32selection would strongly favor the innovation or retention of tRNA modifications. We speculate that 33",

Similarly, it is difficult to imagine how 12 evolutionary gains or losses of tRNA modifications could precipitate genome-scale changes in GC 13 content or genome size. Thus, our systematic phylogenetic analysis clarifies the contrasting roles of 14 strong vs. weak selection acting on tRNA modifications, and on the evolutionary history of key 15 components of bacterial translation. 16",

            "text": "Wald & Margalit, 2014). The nearly ubiquitous presence of target tRNAs may reflect strong 5 positive selection, since the function of target tRNA cannot be carried out by any other tRNA via 6 wobble base pairing rules. Thus, target tRNA may be essential even if their complementary codons 7 are used relatively rarely. 8In summary, we propose that the evolution of diverse bacterial tRNA modification enzymes has 9 been strongly influenced by changes in tRNA gene pools and genomic GC content, as well as by 10 genome reduction in specific lineages. Our results support the hypothesis that these changes 11 weakened selection on MEs and allowed their loss through drift. Conversely, we hypothesize that 12 the loss of non-target tRNA may have generated strong selection for the innovation of the cmo5U 13 modification in \u03b3-proteobacteria and \u03b5-proteobacteria. It is also possible that the tRNA loss 14 succeeded only in the wake of the chance innovation of the cmo5U modification.These patterns 15 generate a number of broad, testable predictions about the future evolutionary trajectory of 16 translational components in various bacterial lineages. For instance, MEs may be lost in GC-rich 17 bacteria without major consequences for translation; such losses should evolutionarily fix the 18 expanded tRNA repertoire; and MEs should face strong positive selection in AT -rich clades with 19 low tRNA diversity. Specifically, in AT rich bacteria, the combination of MEs and largely target 20 tRNAs should confer higher fitness than a full tRNA set without MEs. Our analysis also shows that 21 multiple key components of bacterial translation have evolved in close association with genomic 22 GC content. Although the evolutionary and ecological forces driving GC shifts and GC-independent 23 changes in tRNA diversity remain unclear, our analyses highlight the rich evolutionary dynamics of 24 wobble pairing, and more broadly, bacterial translation. 25 26METHODS 27Phylogenetic tree, genomes and tRNA gene data 28All analyses were carried out in R (R Development Core Team, 2015) using the phytools(Revell,  29   2012) and seqinr(Charif, Thioulouse, Lobry, & Perri\u00e8re, 2005) packages, unless otherwise 30 specified.

For instance, our 19 definition of the (c)mnm5(s2)U modification includes three different modifications: mnm5U, 20 cmnm5U and cmnm5s2U, each of them acting on different isoaccepting tRNA. These modifications 21 have unique MEs that are involved in the last steps of the pathway. MnmE and MnmG are the 22 common enzymes for each of these modifications and they carry out the first step of the modifying 23 the Uridine base (Bj\u00f6rk & Hagervall, 2014) and references therein. Thus, we considered MnmE-24 MnmG to be crucial, and other enzymes such as MnmC, MnmA, MnmH and trmL as auxiliary. The 25 Q base is first biochemically synthesized as Q1 in the bacterial cell using the enzymes FolE, QueC, 26 QueD, QueE and QueF. Subsequently, the Tgt enzyme replaces Guanosine in the anticodon stem 27 loop with Q1 and QueA and QueG convert it to Q ((Bj\u00f6rk & Hagervall, 2014) and references 28 within). A recent report has suggested the possibility of Tgt alone carrying out the Q modification in 29 the absence of QueA and QueG, assuming the existence of a Q salvage pathway (Zallot et al., 30 2017). However, there is no evidence for this phenomenon across most bacteria from our analysis; 31hence, we considered Tgt, QueA and QueG as the crucial enzymes for the Q modification. 32",
