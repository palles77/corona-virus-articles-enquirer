            "text": "Coronavirus virions are enveloped particles containing three or four structural proteins: spike (S) protein, membrane (M) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein (Lai, 1990) . The S protein is a glycoprotein of 180 kDa, which often is cleaved by host proteases into two 90-kDa subunits (Yoshikura and Tejima, 1981; Sturman et a/., 1985) . This protein, which is the outermost protein on the viral envelope, interacts with the host cell receptor, causes cell-cell fusion, and elicits neutralizing antibodies (Collins et a/., 1982; Sturman and Holmes, 1983; Sturman et al., 1985) . The M protein is a transmembrane glycoprotein of 23 kDa, which appears to interact with the nucleocapsid inside the virus particle (Sturman et a/., 1980) . The N protein is a phosphoprotein of 50-60 kDa in size, which interacts with viral RNA (Stohlman et al., 1988 65 kDa, which projects from the viral envelope (King et a/., 1985; Yokomori eta/., 1989) . While the S, M, and N are present in all coronaviruses, the HE protein is detected only in some species of coronavirus, such as bovine coronavirus (BCV) (King et al., 1985; Vlasak et a/., 1988a; Parker et al., 1989 ) turkey coronavirus (TCV) (Dea and Tijssen, 1988) , and human coronavirus (OC43) (Hogue et al., 1984; Hogue and Brian, 1986) but not in avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) or porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (Garwes and Reynolds, 1981; Stern and Sefton, 1982) . Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is the prototypic member of the Coronaviridae, which contains a nonsegmented, positive-sensed genomic RNA of 3 1 kb in length (Pachuk et a/., 1989; Lee et a/., 1991) . In infected cells, seven or eight virus-specific mRNA species are detected. The mRNAs are characterized by a nested-set structure with common 3'-terminal sequences but with unique 5'-regions (Lai et a/., 1981; Leibowitz et al,, 1981) . Although structurally polycistronic, each mRNA encodes only one protein, which is translated from the unique 5'-region. For instance, the S protein is translated from mRNA 3, M protein from mRNA 6, and N protein from mRNA 7 (Leibowitz et a/., 1982; Siddell, 1983) . In addition, the mRNAs possess a common leader sequence of approximately 72 nucleotides in length, which is derived from the 5'-end of the viral genome (Spaan et al., 1983; Lai et al., 1984) . The 3'-end of the leader RNA contains a pentanucleotide sequence of UCUAA, which is homologous to the intergenic sequences present at the beginning of each gene. The copy number of this pentanucleotide sequence was two to four, depending on the particular virus strain (Makino eta/., 1988) and varied after serial passage of virus in cell culture (Makino and Lai, 1989a) . For example, in the neurotropic JHM strain of MHV, the wild-type virus contained three copies of UCUAA; but after 10 to 12 passages, the number of copies was reduced to two (Makino and Lai, 1989a) . This change was accompanied by an alteration in the pattern of mRNA expression (Makino and Lai, 1989a) . Specifically, the JHM variant with two copies of UCUAA (designated as JHM (2)) made a large amount of mRNA 2-1, while wild-type JHM with three copies (JHM (3)) made only a small amount (Makino and Lai, 1989a; Shieh et a/., 1989) . In vitro translation studies revealed that HE protein was encoded by mRNA 2-l (Shieh ef a/., 1989). Thus, HE protein expression in JHM was controlled by the copy number of UCUAA in the leader (Makino and Lai, 1989a; Shieh et al., 1989) .",

However, the hemagglutinin activity in JHM is very weak (Yokomori et a/., 1989) . In order to better understand the biological significance of the HE protein, we examined the structure and expression of HE in several different strains of MHV. The results demonstrated that HE expression varied at both transcriptional and translational levels amongst MHV strains. In contrast to the conserved expression of the other three structural proteins, S, M, and N, the HE gene in most MHV strains appears to be a pseudogene. The significance of the maintenance of HE expression in some of the MHV strains will be discussed.",

Plaque-cloned JHM(2) and JHM(3) viruses (Makino and Lai, 1989a; Shieh et al., 1989; Yokomori et a/., 1989) which have two and three copies of UCUAA in the leader sequence, respectively, and strain A59 were the same as those reported in a previous study (Yokomori et al., 1989) . The two variants of JHM-DL (a large-plaque variant of JHM (Weiner, 1973; Stohlman et a/., 1982) ) containing two or three copies of UCUAA were obtained by a modification of the published procedures (Makino and Lai, 1989a) . Briefly, JHM-DL was passaged serially without dilution in DBT cells, a murine astrocytoma cell line (Hirano et al., 1974) . Virus harvested at the end of the fifth passage was passaged one additional time in DBT cells at low multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) to eliminate possible DI particles. Virus variants were plaque-purified, and the number of UCUAA copies at the 3'-end of the leader was determined by primer extension (Makino et al., 1988) . Viruses with either two or three copies of UCUAA in the leader were designated JHM-DL(2) and JHM-DL(3), respectively. MHV-1 and MHV-S were obtained from Dr. Paul Masters of Wadsworth Center for Laboratories and Research, New York State Depar-tment of Health. MHV-2 has been described previously (Lai and Stohlman, 1981) . Two isolates of MHV-3, i.e., MHV-3-L and MHV-3-Yac, were plaque-purified from stocks originally obtained from Dr. Lucie Lamontagne of the University of Montreal. Viruses were propagated in DBT cells as described previously (Makino et a/,, 1984b) . DBT cells also were used for all the in vivo metabolic labeling experiments.",

The arrows indicate viral structural proteins. Lanes S, 1, 2, and 3 represent MHV-S, MHV-1, MHV-2, and MHV-3, respectively. munoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies directed against JHM(2) virions. Figure 1 shows that while large amounts of HE protein could be detected in cells infected with MHV-S, JHM(2), and JHM-DL(2), only small amounts were detected in JHM(3)-and JHM-DL(3)-infected cells. This finding is consistent with our previous studies, which showed that JHM viruses with three copies of UCUAA in the leader RNA synthesized a much lower amount of HE protein than the virus with two UCUAA copies (Shieh et al., 1989; Yokomori eta/., 1989) . Since the JHM and JHM-DL variants with different copy numbers of UCUAA were isolated independently from different virus stocks, these findings further suggest that variations in the amount of HE protein are related to the copy number of UCUAA rather than some other mutation(s). Strains A59, MHV-1, MHV-2, and two different plaque isolates of MHV-3 did not synthesize HE or any other additional proteins which could be recognized by anti-JHM(2) polyclonal antibodies. These results showed that many strains of MHV do not express HE protein. In contrast to HE, the other three structural proteins (S, N, and M) were synthesized consistently by all viruses. mRNA 2-1 expression by different strains of MHV To determine whether the lack of synthesis of HE protein by different MHV strains was at the transcriptional or translational level, 3'P-labeled virus-specific mRNA from virus-infected cells was examined by aga-rose gel electrophoresis after glyoxal denaturation. Figure 2 shows the intracellular mRNA patterns of the various strains of MHV. Surprisingly, mRNA 2-1, which encodes HE protein, was synthesized by most of the viruses, including MHV-2, and two isolates of MHV-3, even though these strains failed to synthesize any HErelated protein (Fig. 1) . Thus, the mRNA 2-l of MHV-2 and MHV-3 was nonfunctional, or defective in translational control. Consistent with their failure to express HE protein, mRNA 2-l was not detected in A59 or M HV-1 -infected cells.",

Therefore, the sequences of the HE gene region of different viruses were obtained by either direct RNA sequencing or DNA sequencing of PCR products. Oligonucleotides corresponding to the leader RNA and a conserved 3'-end region of the HE gene were used as primers for PCR. Due to the nested-set structure of the coronavirus mRNAs, these clones included sequences from the coding region of the HE gene, the leader-fusion site of mRNA 2-1, and its genomic intergenic sequences. Thus, the 5'unique coding regions of both mRNA 2 and mRNA 2-l were obtained. Sequence data from the HE genes of these viruses revealed substantial numbers of base substitutions, deletions, and insertions spread throughout the coding region of gene 2-l in most viruses. As a result, the open reading frame (ORF) for the HE protein was truncated in A59, MHV-1, MHV-2, and both isolates of MHV-3 (Fig. 3) . Specifically, in contrast to the HE genes of JHM and MHV-S, which had a coding capacity of 440 amino acids, that of A59 encoded only 14 amino acids, MHV-2, 97 amino acids, MHV-3-Y, 27 amino acids, while that of MHV-3-L was 135 amino acids. Although MHV-1 did not synthesize mRNA 2-1, its ORF was capable of encoding a protein of 268 amino acids. The usual initiating AUG of the HE gene in several viruses was also mutated or deleted (Fig. 3) thus providing the potential for additional HE gene variation in different MHV strains.",

Capped RNAs were transcribed in vitro from cDNA clones using T7 RNA polymerase, and then used for in vitro translation in either wheat germ extract or rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. The sizes of the 35S-labeled translation products agreed with the predicted ORF (Fig. 4A) : The MHV-3-L clone yielded a 14-kDa translation product, whereas the MHV-3-Y clone yielded an 4-kDa product. Furthermore, in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomal membrane, MHV-3-L RNA yielded two additional protein products (Fig. 4~3) . The higher band possibly represented glycosylated product, since the ORF contained one potential N-linked glycosylation site. The middle band was of the same size as the primary translation product in the absence of membrane and thus represented the native product of 14 kDa. The lower band most likely represented the core protein, from which the signal peptide had been cleaved off. These results suggest that this truncated HE protein was properly translocated and processed in vitro. However, these protein products were not detected in infected cells (Fig. 1) .",

The intergenic sequence preceding the HE gene was slightly different from the consensus transcription initiation motif seen in most of the other MHV genes, i.e., gene 3 and gene 7 (Table 1) .

            "text": "The HE protein also is present in some other coronaviruses which have a hemagglutinin activity including BCV and human coronavirus OC43, (Vlasak et a/., 1988b) . The HE protein of BCV also exhibits an acetylesterase activity similar to the receptor destroying activity of influenza C virus (Vlasak et a/., 198813) . A similar activity has been demonstrated for the HE protein of MHV (Yokomori et al,, 1989) . Data have been obtained which suggest that the HE protein is required for BCV infectivity. HE protein was the target of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, which also inhibited hemagglutinin and esterase activities (Deregt and Babiuk, 1987; Parker eta/., 1990) . In addition, treatment with diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), an inhibitor of esterase, was found to inhibit virus replication (Vlasak et al., 1988a) . Similar requirements have not been demonstrated for MHV. It should be noted, however, that the presence of the HE protein does alter some biological properties of the virus. For example, in cultured cells, JHM(2) became dominant over JHM(3) after serial undiluted passages (Makino and Lai, 1989a) . In mice, JHM(2) showed greater virulence and neurotropism than JHM(3) (Yokomori, unpublished data) . Finally, passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies against HE protein protected mice from JHM(2) infection (Yokomori, unpublished data). These data suggested that HE may play a role in neuronal infection. Although MHV-3 isolates examined retained a truncated HE ORF, and a protein product could be synthesized and properly processed in an in vitro translation system, no HE-related proteins could be detected in infected cells. The failure to detect these truncated HE proteins in viva was not readily apparent. Perhaps the predicted initiating AUG was not in an ideal context in infected cells, although the sequence around this AUG agrees with the optimum translation context described by Kozak (1987) . Also, the truncated protein products may degrade rapidly; however, even short pulse-labeling (15 min) did not reveal any products (Fig. 1) . Additionally, because the truncated ORFs retained the putative esterase domain and signal sequence but lacked the C-terminal membrane-anchoring domain, we have investigated the possibility that the truncated HE protein may have been released into the media. No HEspecific esterase activity was detected in supernatants from infected cells (data not shown). Thus, the reason that no truncated HE protein was detected in these MHV strains remains unclear.",

            "text": "Another interesting characteristic of the HE gene is its transcriptional control by the copy number of UCUAA pentanucleotide sequence in the leader RNA. Both this report and previous publications (Makino and Lai, 1989a; Yokomori et al., 1989) indicate that only JHM variants with two copies of UCUAA in the leader expresses mRNA 2-1 efficiently, whereas JHM variants with three copies of UCUAA transcribe only small amounts of this mRNA (Makino and Lai, 1989; Shieh et al., 1989) . This mechanism of transcriptional control also was confirmed with a variant of JHM, JHM-DL. Furthermore, we found that other MHV strains also utilized the same transcriptional regulation. Strains MHV-S, MHV-2, and MHV-3 had two UCUAA copies and expressed a large amount of mRNA 2-1, whereas MHV-1 possessed three copies and did not express mRNA 2-1, even though it had the same intergenic sequence preceding the gene as other MHVs. In addition, MHV-1 synthesized a smaller mRNA from a novel downstream site which had a sequence similar to the BANNER. AND IAI consensus transcriptional initiation signal (UUlJ/MJ-CUU vs UCUAAUCUA, respectively). These results strongly suggest that MHV RNA transcription results from an interaction between the leader RNA and the intergenic sequence preceding each gene, although the precise mechanism for this transcriptional control",

JHM and A59 sequences have been published previously (Luytjes et a/., 1988; Shieh et al., 1989). Amino acid sequences are shown above the nucleotide sequence and represent that of JHM (Shieh era/.site for the novel mRNA. The double-underlined sequence at the 3'-end of the gene corresponds to the primer used for PCR. The sequences for MHV-1, -2, -3, and -4 have .been deposited with GenBank. Their accession numbers are M-6431 3, M-6431 4, M-6431 5. and M-6431 6, respectively. ................. T .................. C T.CG ..C .. ............ ..C..T ........................

This conclusion is consistent with the hypothesis that this gene might have been derived from influenza C virus by a fortuitous RNA-RNA recombination event(Luytjes et al., 1988). Nevertheless, the JHM and MHV-S viruses have maintained this gene despite extensive passages in tissue culture and animals.",
