However, the time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP during the outbreak remain unclear. Objectives: We aimed to estimate the basic and time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP across China, and compared them with SARS. Methods: Data on NCP cases by February 7, 2020 were collected from epidemiological investigations or official websites. Data on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases in Guangdong Province, Beijing and Hong Kong during 2002-2003 were also obtained. We estimated the doubling time, basic reproduction number (R0) and time-varying reproduction number (Rt) of NCP and SARS. Measurements and main results: As of February 7, 2020, 34,598 NCP cases were identified in China, and daily confirmed cases decreased after February 4. The doubling time of NCP nationwide was 2.4 days which was shorter than that of SARS in Guangdong (14.3 days), Hong Kong (5.7 days) and Beijing (12.4 days). The R0 of NCP cases nationwide and in Wuhan were 4.5 and 4.4 respectively, which were higher than R0 of SARS in Guangdong (R0=2.3), Hongkong (R0=2.3), and Beijing (R0=2.6). The Rt for NCP continuously decreased especially after January 16 nationwide and in Wuhan. The R0 for secondary NCP cases in Guangdong was 0.6, and the Rt values were less than 1 during the epidemic.",

Several studies have described the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCP, and have demonstrated that it can transmitted between humans (4, 6) . A few studies have also estimated the basic reproduction number (R0) of NCP (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . For instance, Li et al. computed the R0 of 2.2 using daily NCP data before January 4 in Wuhan. Our study using early epidemic stage data also found reproductive number of NCP was 2.9 (11) . However, most of these studies employed daily reporting cases at very early epidemic stage or were purely based on mathematical modeling. It has been suggested that epidemic size may be seriously under-reported due to the unknown etiology and lack of diagnosis protocol at early epidemic stage (12) , which may lead to underestimation of R0. In addition, for control measures to be optimized during ongoing NCP epidemics, temporal changes in reproduction number must be tracked. However, none of previous studies have estimated time-varying instantaneous reproduction number (Rt), which is author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

Second, NCP epidemic coincided with the approaching of Chinese Lunar New Year holiday, during which, under normal circumstances, an estimated 3 billion trips would be made, and 15 million trips occurred in Wuhan (27), which dramatically increased population mobility and accelerated the spread of NCP. Although Wuhan prohibited all transport in and out of the city as of 10:00 on January 23 2020, millions of citizens have left Wuhan before that time, and they may have become the major exporter of 2019-nCoV infection in other regions in China and other counties. Fortunately, the intervention of travel restriction was effective in slowing the 2019-nCoV invasion of new locations (28). We observed significant decrease in the time-varying Rt values of NCP nationwide and in Wuhan particularly after January 16. More importantly, the daily reporting cases began to decline after February 4. These results indicate that the rigorous measures of prevention and control taken by Chinese governments are taking into effect (Figure S4). For example, following the Wuhan travel restriction, most provinces and cities also implemented travel restriction, and conducted quarantine on all outpatients in fever, close contracts, and especially in persons travelling from Hubei Province. The Chinese Lunar New Year holiday was extended, and all gathering and public activities were restricted to prevent the transmission of 2019-nCoV. More importantly, almost all provinces and regions in China have initiated the highest level of public health emergency response. Risk communication and health education on NCP were",
