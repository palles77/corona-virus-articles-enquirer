            "text": "The aim of this study was to characterize the role of quails (Coturnix coturnix japonica) as intermediate hosts for Neospora caninum. Fifty-eight 20-day old quails were individually identified with numbered rings and kept in cages adequate for the species. The birds were fed commercial feed and distilled water ad libitum. They were weighed daily during the first month and every seven days from then on. The birds were randomly distributed into 3 groups; 40 quails (group A) and 8 quails (group B) received 3.5 \u00d7 10 6 and 5 \u00d7 10 6 N. caninum tachyzoites, respectively, and 10 quails (group C) received placebo. Four quails from group A and one from group C had their blood collected and were euthanized on the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 14th, 21th, 30th, 60th, 120th day after infection (DAI), and 4 quails from group B were euthanized on days 60th and 120th DAI. Following euthanasia, the birds were submitted to necropsy, the organs were weighed and fragments were collected for histopathology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and PCR. On the 60th DAI, two dogs were fed tissue obtained from group A quails, and one dog was fed quail tissues from group B. The dogs' blood was collected weekly for serology, and their feces were collected daily for 33 days for microscopy and molecular identification of oocysts. Student's t-test was used to compare the weights of the collected organs and the quail and cloacal temperature. No quail presented any clinical signs or died. Splenomegaly and hepatomegaly were the primary necropsy findings during the first week of infection (p < 0.05). Positive serology, immunoreactivity through IHC and molecular identification of the parasite, were observed, especially during the first two weeks of infection. No dogs eliminated the oocysts or seroconverted. The infected quails gained more weight than the control quails. The results demonstrated that quails are resistant to infection with N. caninum tachyzoites under the conditions of this study.",

In these studies, the authors observed titrations higher than those found in the quails in the present study, and these differences could be due to the infection route used (intraperitoneal), which tends to induce a more intense response from the host. McGuire et al.

However, the number of organs that tested positive was proportionally lower than in other experiments using the intraperitoneal route (Furuta et al., 2007; Mineo et al., 2009) . What became evident in our study is that although the parasite was disseminated, its maintenance in the host was limited, and we were not able to identify its preferred organs or to visualize cysts in tissues, as observed by Mineo et al. (2011) .",

However, this was not the case, and, for example, the tissues of the quail that had the highest IFAT titrations (1:320) did not result positive results by PCR or IHC. Similarly, the organs that were positive for the parasite by technique were negative when another technique was used. A low concentration of parasites or an irregular distribution of parasites may have been responsible for these discrepancies, and using real time PCR may minimize the chances of false negative results during both natural and experimental infections.",
