Apart from the aged and those with co-morbidities, in whom high morbidity and mortality was recorded, most patients had mild manifestations. With the advent of potent antimicrobial agents, the possible threat of widespread and lethal infections was generally considered minimal, and the world was ill-prepared for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak caused by the novel SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in early 2003. SARS wreaked havoc in 29 countries and infected 8422 patients within a short span of a few months [2] . By virtue of its novelty, infectious potential, associated mortality and in particular the lack of proven therapy, SARS-CoV has all the characteristics of a biological agent of choice in bioterrorism. Response to the SARS outbreak can thus serve as a prototype for combating against acts of bioterrorism. We describe our response to this SARS outbreak in the setting of a Hong Kong acute care hospital.",

On the same day, the Hong Kong Hospital Authority Head Office (HAHO), which operates 40 public hospitals and delivers over 92% of inpatient services in the territory, convened an Expert Panel on Severe Community-acquired Pneumonia (SCAP) in response to rumors about this infectious condition adjacent to the territory. It aimed to investigate the possibility of a similar situation in Hong Kong, to formulate guidelines for the prevention of its spread, and to require the reporting of all patients presenting with features of SCAP. The Chief of Service (COS) of the Department of Medicine of our institution, Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital (PYNEH), which employs over 3500 staff to operate 1829 beds (1219 general beds and 610 psychiatric beds) to serve a population of 750,000 on Hong Kong Island, was appointed to the Panel.",

It transpired that etiological diagnosis could be identified in a single patient, a 55-year old Hong Kong gentleman who had made frequent business travels to Shenzhen in the Guangdong Province of Southern China. Admitted on January 22, 2003 to an acute medical ward with respiratory distress and bilateral pneumonia, he was intubated a few hours later in the MICU, but died after 12 days from intractable acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to unresolving pneumonia. None of the healthcare workers (HCW) contacting this patient in the general ward and MICU had fallen ill during his stay. His stored sera, checked in May 2003 retrospectively, confirmed SARS-CoV infection, but this case did not provide us with any clues about an impending infectious disease outbreak, nor were there unusual increases in the number of SCAP in Hong Kong throughout the 2003 winter season. At that time, the possible candidate organisms for the pneumonia outbreak in China were thought to be the usual organisms of atypical pneumonia or the avian influenza (H5N1) virus [4] . A new emerging organism did not rank high as etiological agent, and bioterrorism attack with an existing or a genetically engineered virus had not come to mind. The Panel reminded all frontline HCW to take droplet precautions on contacting pneumonia patients. By February 20, 2003 , the Chinese authorities had reported to WHO that Chlamydia pneumoniae was the likely organism responsible for the recent outbreak of pneumonia [3] .",

He had also traveled to Guangdong, Southern China on February [22] [23] 2003 . The White cell count was not elevated, lymphocyte was 1.0 \u00d7 10 9 /L, and HIV serology was negative. Chest radiograph (CXR) showed bilateral basal pneumonic infiltrates. He was treated as for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and was placed in an open 8-bed cubicle (42 m 2 area) in the ward, with positive pressure ventilation at five air changes per hour (ACH). Because of a report about a fatal case of avian influenza from another hospital in a returnee from China at about the same time [5] , for the benefit of doubt our patient was transferred to an isolation room (13 m 2 , 8 ACH) on Day 2. After his nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) proved negative for influenza A and adenovirus on Day 3, he was moved back to the open cubicle. He then developed diarrhea and CXR continued to deteriorate despite standard antibiotics according to CAP treatment guideline [6] . On Day 6 (March 7, 13 days from symptom onset), he desaturated and was transferred to an isolation room in MICU for noninvasive ventilation (NIV) through a facial mask. On Day 8 (Day 15 from symptom onset), he was intubated because of increasing acute respiratory failure (ARF). Two intubating physicians wore protective garments against contamination by HIV (surgical mask, full-face shield, gown, and gloves), while nurses stood on the side of the bed and wore surgical masks, gown and gloves but not face shields. On Day 14 (March 15, 2003) , the World Health Organization (WHO) published the case definition of suspected SARS at the WHO website, which in retrospect matched the presentation of this patient. He died on Day 15 from intractable acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Subsequent serology against the SARS-CoV was strongly positive. None of the HCW in MICU contracted SARS.",

To enforce strict infection control policies and to ensure staff safety, HAHO appointed relevant experts to review all PPE with ICT from all hospitals, and only those found to be suitable for the purpose were allowed. Among those rejected were the \"barrier man suit\" designed against chemical contamination, and the \"Stryker T4 protective system\" used in operation rooms (OR).

Ward areas were segregated into \"clean\" or non-infectious from \"dirty\" or infectious/potentially infectious areas. Separate routings were designed for entry and exit, with dedicated gowning and de-gowning areas, respectively. To reduce unnecessary entry of non-HCW into cohort wards, buffer areas were delineated near the entrances for the delivery of food and other items. Ventilation of staff changing rooms and toilets were upgraded, with the addition of simple showering facilities in every cohort ward in case gross contamination occurred. Nursing care was streamlined to minimize patient contact. CXR were taken with portable machines stationed in the cohort wards. X-ray film cassettes were disinfected between cases. Medical records were prohibited in patient areas, and documentation could only be made after removal of potentially infectious PPE and donning of new and clean PPE. Documents from cohort wards were sent by email and fascimile, and hard copies were avoided. Hospital wards and operation rooms (OR) in PYNEH had been designed to operate at positive pressure with respect to the surrounding to prevent the ingress of contaminants. Temperature and humidity were closely controlled via a standard heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system. Apart from the OR, a significant proportion of well-mixed room air was re-circulated after filtering and conditioning. As the predominant mode of SARS spread was assumed to be through infectious droplets, the existing HVAC design could not meet infection control requirements. With no clear guidelines for HVAC design for SARS wards and OR, input from ICT and the clinicians were critical toward the modification of engineering and environmental controls. The consensus among all concerned parties in mid-March 2003 was to adopt the isolation room requirements for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) [15] . Immediate ventilation improvement works were thus designed and implemented in the SARS wards to provide sufficient air change for dilution and removal of contaminants; to create negative pressure and achieve directional airflow from the clean to the infected areas; and to incorporate local source control to extract contaminants via the shortest possible path and within the shortest time. In retrospect, we strongly believe that this decision had been pivotal to our success in combating SARS and minimizing its nosocomial spread, since air-borne transmission of this disease had been raised by Hong Kong [16] and Canadian [14] researchers to be a real possibility.",

In Phase 1, frequency of air change was immediately increased on March 13, 2003 from the usual 5 ACH to 6 ACH in all medical wards, and to 7-8 ACH in the SARS cohort ward. Window-type exhaust fans (Figure 23. 3) with sound-absorbing hoods were installed, and folding doors were added to segregate the nurse station from patient cubicles. Unidirectional airflow was thus achieved from the corridors outside the SARS ward, through the clean nurse station to patient areas and finally to the window exhaust. Returned air dampers in the HVAC system were closed to achieve 100% fresh air intake. In Phase 2, fan cowls were added to discharge outlets of exhaust fans to reduce fluctuation in performance caused by strong winds (Figure 23 .4). In Phase 3, windowtype exhaust fans were replaced by heavy-duty ducted exhaust fans with non-return air dampers to achieve 12 ACH. High efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters were installed at exhaust outlets. Exhaust air ducts were next installed at low level ( Figure 23 .5) in Phase 4 to create unidirectional airflow from high level supply diffusers through the breathing zone of HCW before passing on to infected patients and then to the low-level exhaust. Air grilles with double deflection supply were adopted to control airflow patterns and directions and minimize air turbulence and mixing. Additional HEPA filters were installed at return air grilles to allow air re-circulation in wards with lower infection risks. In the last phase (Phase 5), local source control with adjustable and removable exhaust hoods were installed at both sides of hospital beds (Figure 23.6) . Standby exhaust fans were also installed to automatically take over the function of duty fans in case the latter failed.",
