Objectives: To investigate the seroepidemiology of HKU1 infections in our local population. Study design: An ELISA-based IgG antibody detection assay using recombinant HCoV-HKU1 nucleocapsid and spike (S) proteins (genotype A) were developed for the diagnosis of CoV-HKU1 infections, Additionally, a neutralization antibody assay using the HCoV-HKU1 pseudotyped virus was developed to detect the presence of neutralizing antibodies in serum with antibody positivity in an S protein-based ELISA. Results: Results of the recombinant S protein-based ELISA were validated with Western blot, immunofluorescence analysis and flow cytometry. The coupled results demonstrated good correlation with Spearmen's coefficient of 0.94. Seroepidemiological study in a local hospital-based setting using this newly developed ELISA showed steadily increasing HCoV-HKU1 seroprevalence in childhood and early adulthood, from 0% in the age group of <10 years old to a plateau of 21.6% in the age group of 31-40 years old. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated the usefulness of the S-based ELISA which could be applied to future epidemiological studies of HCoV-HKU1 in other localities.",

Laboratory detection is mostly achieved by RT-PCR. 5, 6, 29 Because the nucleocapsid protein is highly conserved, this has been successfully cloned and used to detect antibody response by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and Western blot analysis of sera from infected human. 35, 40 Ideal antibody test for a viral infection is the presence of neutralizing antibody.",

No seropositive serum, above the cutoff values, were failed by WB tested by its target antigen. As expected, 28.5% (6/21) of N-based seropositive samples were tested negative by S-based assay which further indicates the inclusion of double markers is critical in curtailing the false-positive rates and non-specificities.",

For the 4 neutralization-negative, S-based positive samples (S12-S15), were detected containing low level of S-protein-specific antibodies by binding assays immunofluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry using S-expressed BHK-21 cells (Figs. 4 and 5, Table 3 ). 100% consistency of the results in the binding assays and our pseudovirus neutralization tests can be achieved if ELISA cutoff was raised to 0.6, as in samples S1-S11. It is justifiable to set the cutoff to a high level to insure as a reliable index in determination the seroprevalence and excludes the false-positivities posed by the presence of other human coronavirus antibodies. 23, 40 Based on the standard we determined, our results show a rising trend of seroprevalence from age group 11-20, peaks in group from 31-50 (\u223c12%) and declines to 5.3% in age group 61-70, while with no seropositive cases identified in the age group <10 (Fig. 6 ). This pattern is within our expectations, as the incidence of HCoV-HKU1 infections were found to be relatively low (0.3%) in Hong Kong 23, 39 while other reports were mostly targeted to patients with respiratory symptoms and used RT-PCR for viral detection, which would only identify cases with active disease. 9, 10, 11, 14, 19, 21, 22, 29, 31, 34, 37 In contrast, our study excluded sera from patients with respiratory symptoms, and the detection of specific IgG antibodies would allow a better estimation of the incidence in the wider population. Our study is not truly population-based, especially not including extrarespiratory disease 9,37 the present results still demonstrates that a substantial adult population has no demonstrable immunity to HCoV-HKU1.",

There are currently three known genotypes (A, B and C) of HCoV-HKU1 in circulation, with the S proteins of genotypes A and B sharing about 84% amino acid similarity. The S protein of genotype C, arising from the recombination of genotypes A and B, is identical to that of genotype B. It is likely that there will be an appreciable degree of cross-reactivity between the two closely related S proteins and hence the test may pick up some of the patients infected with HCoV-HKU1 genotype B. The incorporation of the S protein of genotype B will be an important area of improvement in the future development of the assay.",
