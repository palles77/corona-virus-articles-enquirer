            "text": "Researchers sometimes face difficulties in the diagnosis of pregnancy and assessment of embryonic development. Ultrasonography (US) is a non-invasive imaging method with minimal side effects on the subjects or operators. It provides real-time evaluation of the physiology of rapidly moving structures (i.e., heart) and facilitates evaluation of fetal tissue development. US discerns tissues based on composition, making it the imaging method of choice for abdominal examination. In this study we used real-time US as an alternative method for early diagnosis of pregnancy in rats. Sixty-four Wistar rats aged 16-20 wk were examined, and day 8 was the earliest point at which pregnancy could be detected. We constructed a detailed timeline of embryonic features detectable by US on days 8 to 19. We trust this index will be a valuable tool. More refined work toward a more detailed ''atlas'' will help to reduce animal sacrifice during embryonic development studies. (",

Early and precise diagnosis of pregnancy, confirmation of the number and age of fetuses and evaluation of embryonic development are prominent in these studies (Krinke 2000) . Pregnancy can be determined traditionally by the presence of a copulatory plug after mating, an enlarged lower abdomen, manual palpation (Agematsu et al. 1983; Bennet and Vickery 1970) , hair loss around nipples and nipple enlargement (Bennet and Vickery 1970; Bivin 1986 ) and finally, monitoring of weight gain.",

The placenta was first evident on D9 (Fig. 1b) , as a hyperechoic zonar structure attached in the inner surface of the gestational sac. On D10, the fetus became distinguishable and the heart was also obvious with color Doppler signal (Fig. 1c) . The cardiac pulse appeared on the same day, but the heart rate could not be measured with pulse wave Doppler.

The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the use of real-time ultrasound examination in the accurate detection of rat pregnancy. According to the data obtained, D8 is the earliest day on which pregnancy could be detected, and it was based on the observation of the embryonic sacs. Detection of pregnancy is just as important as detection of non-pregnancy; it is crucial for researchers in terms of time management and planning, reducing the number of mother animals sacrificed and waiting time between experiments. Such information might prove vital to decision making in each case. In addition, ultrasound imaging of the reproductive tract during pregnancy provides valuable information relative to the developmental stage of embryos, embryo viability and progression of fetal development. Figure 1 is a sequence of representative images of embryonic development. Information on fetal age and development may be gathered from both somatometric measurements and indexing of other detectable features, such as the heart rate on each day of pregnancy (Zambelli and Prati 2006) . Ultrasonographic detection of the heart rate at day 12 was also considered a clear indicator of embryonic age. Days 14 and 15 were milestones with respect to anatomic changes in the fetus, as fetal skeletal morphology could easily be distinguished and evaluated. Furthermore, another useful finding was the detection of fetal abdominal organs from day 15 onward.",

Furthermore, this effort may be of benefit in future experimentation in reducing the numbers of animals used or sacrificed, specifically in protocols concerning pregnancy or embryo transfer. Finally, it is worth mentioning that use of ultrasonography in embryonic development studies provides the unique opportunity to monitor the same pregnant animal throughout the whole gestational period, in parallel with real-time monitoring of the viability and somatometric characteristics of the fetuses.",

Such data, along with the corresponding gestational days, are invaluable in studies concerning pregnancy, fetal development and embryo transfer.",

            "text": "Representative ultrasound images of a rat uterus on different days of gestation: In some of the images, white crosses mark the start and end points of measurements (1, 2) of the longitudinal and transverse diameters, the values of which are given (in cm) in the inset at the top left of the image. (a) Day 8 of gestation: The embryonic sac is visible as a round or oval structure filled with anechoic to isoechoic fluid. (b) Day 9: The developing placenta can also be recognized as a hyperechoic structure attached to the inner surface of the gestational sac. (c) Day 10: The fetus is distinguishable. (d) Day 11: The heart can be imaged by B-mode. (e) Day 12: Cardiac function is detectable using both B-mode and pulse wave Doppler as imaging techniques. (f) Day 13: The extremities are apparent. (g) Day 14: The body and head can be distinguished. (h) Day 15: The body uncoils and the head is distinct from the body. (i) Day 16: The lungs appear as hyperechoic structures surrounding the heart in the thoracic cavity. (j) Day: The urinary bladder is visualized as a cystic structure filled with anechoic fluid (urine), in the abdominal cavity. Ossification of ribs is obvious. Brain ventricles are detectable as hypoechoic discontinuities in the cranial outline. (k) Day 18: The ribs are ossified and visible along with the urinary bladder. (l) Day 19: Brain ventricles are bisected from the ossified joint of the frontal cranial bones. Cranial ossification is more intense and the jawbone can be differentiated.",
