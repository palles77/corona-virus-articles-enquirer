Hippocrates , the father of modern medicine, described several illnesses characteristic of viral diseases, including influenza and poliomyelitis. The ability to definitively identify a specific virus as the cause of an illness has only become possible within the last 100 years.",

Consequently, the first efforts to identify specific viruses relied upon serology, the analysis of the protein antibodies found in blood that the immune system synthesizes against pathogens. Tissue culture, the ability to grow tissues and cells outside of a living organism in a controlled environment, was invented and refined in the first half of the 20th century. This led to the propagation of viruses using cell culture and the detection of the pathogenic effects that viruses exert upon cells. Both serology and tissue culture have been refined and are still vital techniques for the diagnosis of viral infections. Advances in molecular biology have also accelerated our ability to conclusively identify a virus.",

            "text": "The detection of a virus as the cause of an illness is important for many reasons. Several viral infections result in similar clinical symptoms, and viruses with serious effects need to be identified early in order to prescribe the best treatment. Likewise, the infection of high-risk groups, such as transplant recipients, pregnant women, or immunocompromised individuals, needs to be monitored so that critical sequelae can be addressed. The development and availability of antiviral drugs is increasing, and proper diagnosis ensures an effective treatment is prescribed. The typing of viruses is also effective in determining subtypes or strains of viruses, including those that are resistant to certain drugs or are more likely to cause cancer. In the field of epidemiology, most case definitions rely upon laboratory confirmation of the specific virus to confirm a case. Proper diagnosis ensures that accurate surveillance takes place and adequate control measures are instituted during epidemics. It also ensures the safety of transplanted human tissues and safeguards the blood supply. This chapter discusses commonly used techniques for the detection and diagnosis of viruses in clinical samples. Many of these methods are staples in virology research laboratories, as well.",

As described in Chapter 6, \"The Immune Response to Viruses,\" IgM is the antibody isotype that is first produced by plasma cells against a pathogen, but the higher-affinity IgG isotype begins being secreted by plasma cells later during infection and during secondary responses. Therefore, the choice of diagnostic test will depend upon the patient's stage of infection. Tests for the virus itself are best performed before or while symptoms are present. The levels of IgM versus IgG antibodies against a virus can be used to help determine if the infection recently occurred, but neither of these will be present at the beginning of a primary infection.",

Blood is collected into appropriate tubes, depending upon whether cells, serum, or plasma is required for the diagnostic test. Tubes containing sodium heparin or EDTA as an anticoagulant block the clotting of blood and are used to obtain white blood cells (leukocytes) or plasma, the liquid fraction that remains when blood is centrifuged to pellet blood cells. Serum is obtained by allowing blood to clot and then centrifuging the clot, leaving behind the liquid portion of the blood (Fig. 7 .2). The difference between plasma and serum, therefore, is that plasma contains clotting factors that are part of the clot when serum is obtained. Antibodies and virus/virus antigen will be found in serum and plasma, although virus could also be found in the leukocytes, if they are a target of the virus. For collecting fluid from skin lesions, a sterile swab is used to collect the fluid and cells from a lesion that has been opened, and then the swab is placed in a special transport medium. The same transport medium is used for nasopharyngeal swabs, cervical swabs, rectal swabs, or throat swabs. Stool is collected into a clean, leak-proof container. The susceptibility of viruses to environmental factors can be an issue for diagnostic tests that rely upon \"live\" virus. As mentioned in Chapter 5, \"Virus Transmission and Epidemiology,\" most viruses will become noninfectious after being exposed to extended periods of heat. Although nucleic acids may be able to be recovered from these samples, infectious virus will not be present. To prevent virus inactivation, samples other than blood that must be transported to diagnostic laboratories are refrigerated during shipment, or frozen at \u221280\u00b0C and shipped on dry ice if the transport will take 3 days or more. However, some viruses are not stable when frozen, including varicella zoster virus, respiratory syncytial virus, measles, and human cytomegalovirus. These viruses must be frozen in a special transport medium to prevent their inactivation. Much emphasis is placed upon the efficacy of the diagnostic test itself, but no assay can provide meaningful results if the specimen has not been collected, stored, and transported with care.",

            "text": "Methods for detecting viruses are either direct or indirect methods. Direct methods assay for the presence of the virus itself, while indirect methods observe the effects of the virus, such as cell death or the production of antibodies by the infected individual. Tissue culture is a way to identify a virus based upon the effects of the virus upon the cells. It is also a way to amplify virus if a larger sample is needed for other diagnostic tests, since viruses require cells to replicate. Tissue culture, also known as cell culture when cells are grown specifically, involves maintaining living cells or tissues in a controlled environment outside a living organism. The cells are housed in plastic flasks or bottles and bathed in a liquid growth medium that contains nutrients and supplements (Fig. 7.3A ). These cultures are grown in an incubator set to body temperature (37\u00b0C). A cell line is a set of cells that have been isolated from a tissue or organ fragment ( Fig. 7 .3B and C). Cell lines can be finite or continuous. Finite cell lines will only undergo mitosis a limited number of times, while continuous cell lines are immortal and will proliferate indefinitely. This characteristic is usually a result of genetic mutations. Cell lines derived from tumors, which have lost control of regulating the cell cycle and proliferate indefinitely, can also result in continuous cell lines. The choice of a finite versus continuous cell line for propagating viruses in culture will depend upon the virus that is needed to be isolated. Additionally, the cell line must be one that expresses the cell surface receptor specific for the virus and be permissive to infection; otherwise, the virus will not be able to attach and replicate within the cell line. Cell cultures must be grown using aseptic technique and sterile conditions, otherwise bacteria and fungi that get into the cell culture will grow profusely in the rich growth medium and contaminate the culture. A sterile environment is provided by a biological safety cabinet (BSC), which is different from a fume hood that is used when working with chemicals. A BSC uses a fan to filter air through highefficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, which filter out bacteria, fungi, spores, and viruses to generate sterile air. Particles of 0.3 \u03bcM in size are the most penetrating through the filters but are still removed with 99.97% efficiency. There are three different classes of BSCs, designated class I, class II, and class III, that provide varying levels of protection to the worker and to the biological material being manipulated. Class I BSCs act much like chemical fume hoods, except that the air is filtered through a HEPA filter before it is released to the environment. The worker and environment are protected, but the biological material is exposed to nonsterile air from the environment so these are not used for cell culture (Fig. 7.4A ). Class II BSCs are most often used, as they afford protection to the worker, the biological material, and the environment. The air entering the BSC from the front is sucked into a grille to prevent it from contaminating the working surface, which is constantly bathed in HEPA-filtered air to ensure a sterile working environment (Fig. 7.4B and D) . Class II BSCs rely on the laminar flow of air, which means that the BSC creates an uninterrupted flow of air in a consistent, uninterrupted stream. As long as the work is performed within the stream of air, then the material will remain sterile. The air is also sent through a HEPA filter before being released to the environment. Class II BSCs are sufficient to work with cells and the majority of viruses. Some dangerous pathogens must be manipulated within a class III BSC, which is air-tight to prevent any exposure of the virus to the worker, who must use the heavy-duty rubber gloves that are built into the BSC to work with the pathogen (Fig. 7.4C) . The air leaving a class III BSC is passed through two HEPA filters, or a single HEPA filter and incinerator, to ensure the pathogen does not enter the environment.",

These pathogens present minimal potential hazard to laboratory personnel and the environment. All material must be handled in an appropriate way and decontaminated after use, and workers must use gloves for protection, along with a lab coat and safety glasses, if warranted. Work with BSL1 agents does not require a BSC, unless cell cultures require the use of one to maintain sterility. Biosafety level 2 (BSL2) is for work with agents that are known to pose moderate hazards to personnel and/or the environment. It includes all the precautions of BSL1 but also requires that laboratory personnel are supervised, receive specific training in handling the pathogenic agents, and conduct any work that may generate infectious aerosols or splashes in a BSC. Biosafety level 3 (BSL3) is for work that could cause serious or potentially lethal disease through inhalation. BSL3 work includes all the precautions of BSL2 but also requires a special BSL3-level laboratory that Class I BSCs protect the environment by filtering contaminated air through a HEPA filter, but the cabinet does not provide a sterile environment within it. Class I BSCs are mainly used to house equipment that might generate aerosols but are not for use with sterile cultures. (B) Class II BSCs filter the environmental air through a HEPA filter before entering the cabinet to provide a sterile working surface.

The great majority of research and clinical laboratory work involving viruses is performed in a Class II BSC. is entered through two self-closing doors and is under negative pressure so that contaminated air is drawn to another area and HEPA-filtered before leaving the room. Laboratory personnel must wear additional protective laboratory clothing, such as a gown, scrub suit, or coveralls, that is only worn while in the laboratory and then decontaminated or disposed of upon exit of the lab. Work must be performed in class II or class III BSCs, depending upon the virus. Biosafety level 4 (BSL4) is for work with dangerous and exotic agents that pose a high individual risk of aerosol-transmitted laboratory infections and lifethreatening disease that is frequently fatal and for which no vaccines or treatments are available. In addition to BSL3 standards, personnel must change out of their normal clothing and into laboratory clothing in a specific entry room. Some BSL4 labs use BSL3protective laboratory clothing but class III BSCs are required for manipulating any infectious materials, which must be decontaminated when passing out of the BSC. Other BSL4 labs require the use of a onepiece protective plastic suit with a separate air supply to keep the suit under positive pressure, which would push out air if any cuts or tears were to occur ( Fig. 7 .5). .5 BSL4 protective suit. This researcher at the CDC is using a light box to count viral plaques in a BSL4 laboratory. Note that the suit is inflated because of the air supply, which keeps it under positive pressure in case of a leak in the suit. The researcher also must wear laboratory clothing under the suit (scrubs in this case). Upon exiting the lab, the worker will pass through a bleach shower to decontaminate the orange plastic suit, change out of his laboratory clothing, and then take a personal shower before changing back into his street clothes.

For example, some viruses may cause cells that normally attach to the bottom of their culture vessel to round up and detach. Large bubblelike vacuoles are sometimes observed in the cytoplasm of infected cells, which may also swell or shrink, depending upon the virus. Other viruses cause adjacent cell membranes to fuse together, creating a syncytium, or giant multinucleated cell, that can have up to 100 nuclei within the cell.

            "text": "Although cell culture, cytology, and histology are valuable in providing visible clues as to the identity of a virus, some viruses cause similar CPEs or no visible CPEs at all. In these cases, it is necessary to use assays that detect viral antigens to prove the presence of a virus. This is accomplished by using antibodies that recognize specific viral antigens. Due to the advents of biotechnology, antibodies can be produced in large amounts and are commercially available. These antibodies recognize different antigens from a wide range of pathogens, including viruses. Several widely used and relatively fast assays make use of antibodies to identify the cause of a viral infection. \"Immuno\" is usually found in the name of the assay to indicate that it uses antibodies, which are produced by plasma cells of the immune system. IFAs are performed on cells or tissues that have been affixed to slides and exposed to a fixative. The cells can be from patient specimens or they can be cell cultures that have been infected with patient samples. IFAs use antibodies that are conjugated to fluorophores, or fluorescent dyes, that give off a certain color when they are excited by a particular wavelength of light. The best-known fluorescent dye is fluorescein isothiocyanate, better known as FITC, which is excited by light of 490 nm (blue) and gives off light in the 519 nm range (green). In an IFA, FITC-conjugated antibodies specific for a certain virus are added in a liquid buffer onto the cells or tissue on the slide (Fig. 7.7A ). If the viral antigen that is recognized by the antibody is present on the cell surface, perhaps because the virus was assembling at the plasma membrane or was in the process of infecting cells when the section was fixed, then the antibodies will bind to the viral antigen present. Alternatively, the cells can be permeabilized with a detergent to allow the antibodies to enter inside the plasma membrane and bind viral antigens there (Fig. 7.7B ). In either case, the antibodies will not bind if the specific antigen is not present. After a sufficient period of time to allow binding of the FITC-labeled antibodies, the slides are washed with a buffer. Any antibody that is bound will remain bound, whereas unbound antibody will be rinsed off. The slides are examined under a fluorescence microscope, which contains a special lightbulb that can provide the wavelengths of light able to excite the fluorophores and filters that allow the viewer to see one emitted color at a time. In this case, if any green cells are seen, then the antibodies bound and the virus was present.",

This is a way to get around not having a conjugated primary antibody. It can also be used to amplify a weak signal when not much viral antigen is present. Because this assay requires a secondary antibody and the fluorochrome is not attached to the primary antibody, it is known as an indirect IFA. IFA is used for the identification of a variety of viruses, including several different herpesviruses, influenza, measles, mumps, and adenovirus ( Fig. 7.7D ).",

Instead, they assay for viral antigens in liquid samples, such as serum or urine. A sandwich ELISA, starts by adding antibodies in a buffer to a special plastic plate that has been treated to bind proteins-including antibodiesto it (Fig. 7.8 ). These are known as \"capture antibodies\" because they will be used to capture the antigen from the patient sample. Once the antibodies have bound, the wells of the plate-usually there are 96 of them-are rinsed with a buffer to remove any unbound antibody. The plate is blocked, meaning that a buffer is added that contains nonspecific proteins, which attach to the plastic wells wherever there is no antibody bound. The wells are rinsed again, and then the patient's sample is added. If the antigen is present in the sample, either because the virus or pieces of the virus are present, then the antigen will bind to the capture antibody.

The test strip contains three major zones: a reaction zone, test zone, and control zone. In the case of the influenza LFIA, the patient specimen (usually a nasal or nasopharyngeal swab) is mixed with a buffer that disrupts any virions that are present, releasing the viral antigens. A drop of the liquid sample is placed in the sample well on one end of the LFIA test, and the viral antigens begin to move through the membrane through capillary action to the reaction zone of the test. The reaction zone contains free antibodies that are bound to gold beads or blue latex beads, which will be the basis for the formation of color later in the test. As the viral antigens pass through the reaction zone, the bead-linked antibodies bind to the antigens, and the antigen-bead complex continues moving through the membrane. The test zone is the next zone encountered. In the test zone, other antibodies are immobilized to the membrane and recognize the viral antigens that are bound to the reaction zone bead-linked antibodies. The binding of the antigen-bead complex to the test zone antibodies immobilizes the antigen-bead complexes to the test zone area, creating an antigen sandwich. As the beads begin accumulating, the color of the FIGURE 7.11 Agglutination/hemagglutination. (A) Latex agglutination assays coat viral antigen onto latex beads. If antibodies are present that recognize the antigen, they will agglutinate the beads. The same procedure can be performed to assay for the presence of viral antigens by coating antibodies on the beads. (B) Hemagglutination refers to the agglutination of red blood cells specifically. Several viruses, including influenza virus and measles virus, possess hemagglutinin proteins that bind to red blood cell surface glycoproteins. Hemagglutination can be used to identify these viruses. (C) The results of a hemagglutination reaction that show hemagglutination occurring as increasing amounts of virus are titrated into the wells. The \"button\" on the left and the \"clump\" on the right show the visible change that occurs with hemagglutinated blood (on right). Image courtesy of Liu, Y., et al., 2013.

The patient's sample is added to the sample well of the assay and begins moving though the membrane via capillary action. In the reaction zone, antigens found in the patient's sample bind to free antibody-coated beads. The bead-antigen complexes continue traveling to the test zone, where membranebound antibodies bind to the antigen, thereby immobilizing the beads. As the beads accumulate, a colored line is formed. Excess bead complexes continue moving through the membrane and are eventually bound by control zone antibodies that recognize the bead complex, rather than antigen. As excess beads accumulate here, a colored control line is formed. (B) LFIAs are useful for diagnosis of viral infection in animals, as well. This LFIA tests for two feline viruses, feline immunodeficiency virus and feline leukemia virus. Note that the control spot is present, but there are no other colored spots in the test zone area, indicating that the animal was negative for both viruses. beads becomes apparent. Blue latex beads provide a blue band, and gold beads appear as a red band. This indicates a positive result-that the person's specimen contained the virus.",

In the process of PCR, DNA (including any viral DNA present) is isolated from the clinical specimen, generally blood cells or tissue, and added to a tube containing primers, DNA polymerase, and nucleotides ( Fig. 7.14) . The tube is placed in a thermocycler, a bench-top machine that simply changes the temperature of the tube, as its name suggests. In the denaturation stage of PCR, the thermocycler heats the DNA, usually to 95\u00b0C, which breaks the hydrogen bonds holding the two DNA strands together and so they separate from each other. In the annealing stage, the temperature is reduced to allow the binding (annealing) of two primers to the separated DNA. The primers are complementary to the sequence to which they bind, and they flank the region to be amplified, one primer on each strand. The annealing temperature is determined by the composition of the nucleotides in the primers, but is usually around 55\u00b0C.",

A modification of PCR that is ubiquitously used is known as real-time PCR, so named because the user can monitor the amplicon amplification in real time using a special thermocycler. A great advantage of monitoring the reaction as it proceeds is that the rate of amplification can be noted. Traditional PCR machines analyze the product after the completion of all cycles, which makes it impossible to know if the reaction had plateaued at an earlier cycle because of limitations in reagents, such as nucleotides. Real-time PCR machines address this concern by providing a visual graph of the amplification. An advantage of being able to see the amplification in real time is that the quantity of the PCR product can be used to back calculate the amount of starting template nucleic acid that was present, since we know that each cycle doubles the amount of DNA. For this reason, real-time PCR is also known as quantitative PCR. Therefore, the standard abbreviation for real-time PCR, is qPCR.

            "text": "How is DNA amplification monitored in real time during qPCR? There are two major methods, and both involve the use of fluorescence. In the first method, a fluorescent dye is used that intercalates into double-stranded DNA, in the same way that ethidium bromide does. An example of a fluorescent DNA-binding dye is SYBR Green, which is excited with light of 488 nm and emits light at 522 nm (green). The real-time thermocycler is able to provide the excitation wavelength and has detectors to measure the emitted wavelength. Another method involves fluorescent reporter probes, such as Taq-Man \u00ae probes ( Fig. 7.15A) . Like a primer, the probe recognizes a sequence of the DNA target, but it is located in the middle of the amplified sequence, in between the primers. Attached to the probe are a fluorescent reporter dye at one end and a quencher at the other. As long as the reporter dye and quencher are attached to the probe, the quencher absorbs the fluorescence emitted by the excited reporter dye (through the process of fluorescence resonance energy transfer, or FRET). Taq polymerase breaks down the nucleotides of the probe as it amplifies the DNA to which the probe is bound, releasing the reporter dye and quencher from the probe. When this occurs, the two are physically separated and the quencher molecule can no longer inhibit the reporter's fluorescence. As with the fluorescent double-stranded DNA dyes, reporter dyes are excited and detected by the thermocycler. Using either method, an increase in fluorescence indicates an increase in amplified product. A DNA amplification plot is created as the measurements of fluorescence are taken in real time (Fig. 7.15B ). This allows the DNA product to be quantified at a cycle number where the amplification is in exponential phase, which can be used to back calculate the amount of starting template DNA. Multiplex qPCR assays have also been developed that allow for the simultaneous detection of several fluorescent probes in one tube, one for each amplified viral DNA segment. PCR and qPCR amplify specific sequences of viral DNA. On the other hand, DNA microarrays rely upon the hybridization of viral nucleic acid segments to a synthesized piece of DNA. \"Hybridization\" refers to the complementary binding of two nucleic acid pieces to each other; for instance, primers hybridize with their target DNA during PCR. With DNA microarrays, thousands of short single-stranded pieces of DNA, called oligonucleotides (oligos), are immobilized onto a small silicon chip or glass slide (Fig. 7.16B) . Oligos, like primers, are able to be synthesized in the laboratory using a specialized piece of equipment that bonds individual nucleotides together into a strand of nucleic acid. When detecting the presence of viral nucleic acid, the sequences of the synthesized oligo probes spotted on the chip are complementary to known sequences within the viral genome of interest.",

Primers are used that amplify randomly, rather than specifically, so that all DNA in the sample is amplified. Fluorescent nucleotides are incorporated into the amplified DNA. Following amplification, the fluorescent DNA is added to the microarray, and hybridization is allowed to occur between the sample DNA and the oligos on the microarray. Any hybridized DNA will remain bound to the oligos on the chip, while unhybridized DNA is rinsed away. The microarray is read by a machine that measures fluorescence. If fluorescence is present at a particular oligo spot, then the DNA from the sample is bound there and the machine will report a positive result (Fig. 7.16C ). The identity of each oligo is known, and so the sequences present in the initial DNA sample can be determined. Real-time PCR works on the same principles as PCR, except that it measures the fluorescence of a reporter dye in real time to monitor the amplification reaction. DNA-binding dyes are used, as are probes attached to a reporter dye and quencher molecule (A). The probe hybridizes to a section of the target DNA in between the two primers. As long as the reporter and quencher are physically close, the quencher absorbs any fluorescence and none is given off. As the primer is extended by DNA polymerase, the probe is broken down, releasing the reporter dye and quencher. Free from the quencher, the reporter dye fluoresces. The fluorescence increases as each cycle is repeated. (B) A real-time PCR amplification plot showing the amplification of eight different concentrations of JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) DNA. The number of reaction cycles is on the X axis, while the fluorescence generated in the reactions is on the Y axis. A few important things to note: The samples that start with more DNA are amplified more quickly (require fewer cycles to reach a set threshold, T). Also, each of the cycles eventually plateaus around the same fluorescence, even though we know some samples contain more DNA than others. This is why the samples are compared at the threshold limit (green line). This was multiplex qPCR: black lines are the amplification of a JCPyV protein-coding genomic sequence, while the red lines are the amplification of a noncoding genomic region. Amplification plot reprinted from Ryschkewitsch, C.F., et al., 2013 Microarrays can be used for virus identification, but by modifying the oligos on the chip, microarrays can also identify strains of viruses that are particularly virulent or are genetically resistant to certain therapeutics.

The ViroChip uses long, 70-nucleotide oligos (\"70-mers\") as probes that are complementary to known viral sequences. The ViroChip contains over 60,000 probes that detect over 1000 viruses. The researchers included oligos for conserved and novel sequences found in related viruses. In this way, the ViroChip can identify similar viruses based upon conserved genomic regions and can also identify individual subtypes or strains based upon novel nucleotide sequences not possessed by related viruses. The ViroChip can also be used to characterize novel viruses. For example, it was used in 2003 to assist the CDC in identifying a novel virus that was causing deaths in Southeast Asia. The microarray suggested that the unknown virus was a previously unrecognized coronavirus, later to be known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV).",

High-throughput sequencing methods allow for the determination of the nucleotide sequence of potentially any biological entity, including viruses. In the earlier days of viral diagnosis, CPEs were used to classify differences in subtypes or genotypes of viruses. This was replaced by serology and the use of antibodies to determine the viral subtype, and now sequencing of viral genomes provides a definitive differentiation at the nucleic acid level. Currently, over 4600 viral genomes have been completely sequenced, and public databases exist for the genomes of HIV, influenza viruses, dengue virus, and hepatitis C virus, among others. Sequencing also allows us to track the genetic differences between related subtypes and strains of viruses, and it assists scientists in identifying novel viruses by comparing genome sequences with those of known viruses. Bioinformatics is the field of study that uses computers to analyze and compare biological data, including genome and protein sequences. Bioinformatics is used to compare viral genome sequences, monitor viral evolution over time, and track virus mutations that appear during epidemics.",

For microarrays like the ViroChip that identify viruses within a sample, the starting DNA is copied using PCR. Fluorescent nucleotides are incorporated in the process. Then, the fluorescent amplicons are added to the microarray, which has spotted on it thousands of different oligonucleotide probes that each recognize a different viral sequence. If hybridization occurs with the sample DNA, then the virus's nucleic acid was present in the starting sample. A machine measures the fluorescence at each spot. (B) An example of a microarray, found on the blue chip in the middle of the photo. Note the size of the chip, compared to the size of this researcher's thumb. This chip contains 50,000 probes that hybridize to single nucleotide differences within the human genome. (C) Just a small portion (400 oligo spots) of an actual readout of a chip, showing in which spots fluorescence is present. This result used two different samples of cDNA, one labeled green and one labeled red. l Specimens can be collected from a variety of body fluids. The choice of specimen will depend upon the site and stage of infection and whether it is best to test for virus or antiviral antibodies.",

Plasma is the liquid portion of nonclotted blood (and so contains clotting factors), while serum is the liquid portion of clotted blood. l Specimens must be carefully acquired, stored, and transported to ensure integrity of the samples. This is critical to ensure a meaningful and accurate test result.Section 7.2 Virus Culture and Cell/Tissue Specimens l Direct diagnostic methods assay for the presence of the virus, while indirect methods test for effects of the virus.l Cell culture is the process of growing cells or tissues in the laboratory, using an incubator and special culture medium. Cells must be manipulated in at least a class II BSCs to maintain the sterility of the cultures. l Biological safety cabinets rely upon filtering air through HEPA filters, which filter out 99.97% of particles 0.3 \u03bcM in size. Class II BSCs are most often used in research and clinical diagnostic laboratories. l Certain viruses can cause severe effects and must be handled with caution. BSLs specify which precautions should be taken and are determined by the type of pathogen. They range in stringency from BSL1 to BSL4. l Cell lines can be infected with patient samples to allow viral replication within the cells. CPEs, such as morphological changes, ballooning, syncytia formation, or inclusion bodies, can help to identify the virus identity. Infected cells can also be used for IFAs. l Cytology and histology are the staining and microscopic examination of cell and tissue specimens, respectively. Section 7.3 Detection of Viral Antigens or Antiviral Antibodies l There are a variety of immunoassays that use antibodies to identify viruses or antiviral antigens. The commercial availability of manufactured antibodies has revolutionized diagnostics. l Immunofluorescence assays are performed on fixed cells or tissue. Fluorescently labeled antibodies bind to viral antigens present in infected cells. A fluorescence microscope is used to excite the fluorophores so they give off colored light. IHC works in the same way except a colored precipitate is deposited at the site of the antibody. l ELISAs can be used to verify the presence of viral antigens or antiviral antibodies in liquid patient specimens. In a direct sandwich ELISA, capture antibodies that specifically recognize the viral antigen are coated on the bottom of an ELISA plate with 96 wells. If the patient sample contains the virus, then it will bind to the antibodies and become immobilized to the well. Detection antibodies are conjugated to an enzyme that will cause color change when a substrate is added. An indirect ELISA uses the same principles but coats viral antigen on the plate bottom to detect antiviral antibodies in a patient sample. l Western blots are sometimes used as a confirmatory test. They are analogous to indirect ELISAs, except the viral antigens are separated by PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane before patient samples are added.l Agglutination reactions use antigen-or antibody-coated latex beads. If the patient sample contains the complementary antibody or antigen, the beads will agglutinate and form a lattice clump. Some viruses naturally hemagglutinate red blood cells.l LFIAs work like an ELISA in a stick. They rely upon a liquid patient sample traveling through a membrane and encountering antibody-coated beads that accumulate to cause a visible line. l Plaque assays measure the amount of infectious virus in a sample. It measures the number of plaques formed by allowing a single virion to infect a cell and laterally infect neighboring cells, forming clearings that become visible when the cells are stained. To determine the PFU/mL, the number of plaques is divided by the sample dilution and the volume added to the cells.Section 7.4 Detection of Viral Nucleic Acids l Nucleic acid testing is a sensitive and specific way to identify viruses and viral subtypes/strains. l PCR recapitulates DNA replication in a test tube. Following the isolation of nucleic acid from the clinical specimen, a thermocycler uses heat to separate the two DNA strands. Primers anneal to a target sequence on each strand, and Taq polymerase extends the primer to create the complementary strand. The process is repeated 30-35 times to generate billions of copies of the amplified sequence. l Real-time PCR uses fluorescence to monitor PCR reactions in real time. It is quantitative because the rate of the reaction can be used to determine the initial starting material. l DNA microarrays rely upon the hybridization of fluorescently tagged DNA or cDNA to oligo probes coated on a glass slide or silicon chip. These are currently used for research purposes but have great potential for viral diagnosis. genotypes. It generates nucleic acid sequences that can be analyzed using bioinformatics. ",
