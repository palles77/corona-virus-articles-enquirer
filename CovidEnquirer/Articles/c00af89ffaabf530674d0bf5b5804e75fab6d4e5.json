            "text": "Since viruses, in contrast to bacteria, replicate inside cells and use part of the cellular machinery for this replication, the development of selective antiviral drugs has been difficult and slow. However, the situation improved about two decades ago when the first virus-coded enzymes were characterized and when a few selective antiviral drugs such as idoxuridine, methisazone and amantadine were discovered. These compounds were found by serendipity but today the scientific situation has changed and a number of virus specific processes are used as targets for a more rational selection and design of antiviral drugs.",

In the latter case a compound could act directly as an inhibitor of a viral enzyme (e.g. inhibition of herpesvirus DNA polymerase by foscarnet) or be activated by a viral enzyme (e.g. phosphorylation of acyclovir by a viral thymidine kinase) to form a compound which then affects virus replication and, in some cases, also cellular functions. It is clear from Table 3 .1 that most viruses induce RNA or DNA polymerases and also other enzymes which can be used as targets for antiviral compounds.",

Their functions, apart from the binding of virus particles, are not fully known but for example histocompatibility antigen sites may also be receptors for arboviruses. The receptors seem to be composed of proteins, lipids and often polysaccharides. Different viruses can either share receptors or use differ-ent receptors. Introduction of receptors in the cell membrane of a cell normally resistant to infection can make it susceptible. The number of receptors for a virus will depend on the type of virus and cell and has been estimated to be 104-5 x lo5 per cell. The polypeptide sequence and structure of the protein (HA) in influenza A virus responsible for binding to a receptor is now known and future work in this area will provide detailed information for other viruses about the viral peptide sequences responsible for the binding to a receptor. The possibility of preventing influenza virus adsorption has been investigated using oligopeptides with sequences similar to those of the viral proteins responsible for absorption (see Chapter 8 for details of oligopeptides versus measles virus). An advantage of this type of inhibitor is that it should act on the outside of cells and is not required to penetrate cells. This could be of advantage from a toxicity point of view. A disadvantage is the possibility that these inhibitors are likely to be competitive and might require high concentrations of drug and also that certain of the peptides may be hydrophobic, leading to problems of solubility.",

            "text": "The combination of the techniques of genetic engineering and rapid DNA sequencing has resulted in extensive new data about the amino acid sequence of influenza proteins. In an early series of experiments Porter et al. (1979) cloned gene 4 (coding for the important haemagglutinin (HA)) protein of an influenza A virus by inserting a DNA copy into an E. coli plasmid. Rapid DNA sequencing techniques then allowed a determination of the complete nucleotide sequence of the HA molecule and this classic study has now been extended and applied to the HA of other influenza A viruses. It is apparent by inspection of the amino acid sequences of the HA of viruses so unrelated antigenically as A/PR/8/34 (H IN 1) and an H3N2 virus isolated in the 1970s (See Chapter 7) that certain short amino acid stretches have been conserved over this 45 year period, whereas most of the rest of the molecule is completely different (reviewed by Laver et al., 1980) . This might imply a common and important function of this short common sequence, and a resemblance to the amino acid sequence in the fusion (F) protein of the paramyxovirus Sendai led to the suggestion that the sequence at the N terminus of the HA2 polypeptide of influenza HA had a similar function (namely, fusion with cell membranes), allowing exit of nucleic acid from the virus and entry into the cell nucleus. Quite separate biological experiments by White et al. (1981) established that under low pH conditions influenza viruses could lyse red blood cells and cause fusion of tissue culture cells. Richardson et al. ( 1980) synthesized the short peptides Z-Gly-Leu-L-Phe-Gly and Z-Gly-L-Phe-L-Phe-Gly which mimicked the sequences at the N terminus of the HA2 polypeptide described above and relatively low concentrations (20-50 pM) of the peptides inhibited influenza virus replication in tissue culture studies (See Chapter 7). The possibility of short peptides acting in vivo as antivirals in a milieu of proteolytic enzymes would seem remote, but it may be possible to synthesize analogues or add groupings to prevent rapid enzyme digestion in vivo.",

            "text": "These biochemical studies have also raised basic questions about the mode of action of amantadine. Since the compound acts early in infection, does it inhibit virus fusion? The interpretation of the data is even more complicated by the results of a recent study (Richman et al., 1982) which demonstrated quite clearly that although amantadine is taken up rapidly by tissue culture cells, it is less rapidly lost when the cells are incubated in amantadine-free medium. On the other hand, the antiviral action is lost almost immediately the cells are placed in the drug free medium. This suggests that intracellular amantadine has little effect on the antiviral state and that perhaps the interaction of amantadine with the external surface of the plasma membrane could explain the antiviral action. Amantadine belongs to a class of compounds termed 'lysosomotropic' which can increase intralysosomal pH (Poole and Ohkuma, 1981) . If fusion is an important stage in influenza virus replication, and if such a fusion occurs only at a low pH in cytoplasmic vacuoles, then it is still possible that amantadine could act by raising the intravacuolar pH, thus stopping fusion and blocking virus replication at this stage.",

Anti-neuraminidase antibodies can inhibit viral replication as also can specific inhibitors of the NA and hence the enzyme is a suitable target for chemotherapy (reviewed by Palese and Schulman, 1977) . If sequences of the NA protein are conserved independently of antigenic drift then short oligopeptides could be synthesized and any inhibitory effect investigated as described above for HA protein. The RNA coding for the NA protein is 1413 nucleotides long including 20 nucleotides 5' to the first AUG and 3 1 nucleotides 3' to the last codon. Only one reading frame is open, beginning with AUG at position 21 and the other two reading frames are blocked by termination codons. The predicated NA protein is co-linear with the RNA and occupies 97% of the coding capacity of the gene and thus the gene codes for a single protein. A major hydrophobic region is located near the N-terminus from residues 7 to 35. In the two human subtypes (N1 and N2) total conservation of the first 12 amino acids has been described and thus some critical role such as interaction with another virus protein or NA subunit might be anticipated for this short sequence. The NA polypeptide may have an extended signal sequence responsible for transferring the NA protein across the membrane and remaining in the bilayer to anchor the NA.",

Earlier studies of cell surface receptors for paramyxoviruses indicated the importance of sialic acids of cell surface oligosaccharides, since sialidase treatment of host cells prevented virus infection. More recent studies have shown that the host cell receptors for Sendai virus are more complex and that specific gangliosides act as host cell receptors (Holmgren et al., 1980) . In an experimental approach Markwell et al. (1981) , removed cell receptors to Sendai virus on MDBK cells by sialidase and incubated the cells with individual highly purified gangliosides and determined if the MDBK cells regained their susceptibility to virus absorption and infection. Incubation of the cells with ganglioside containing the sequence NeuAccr2, 3 Gal B1, 3 Gal NAC fully restored susceptibility of infection to the cells. A ganglioside in which the sequence ended in two sialic acids in a NeuAccr2, 8NeuAc linkage instead of a single sialic acid was 100 times more effective as a receptor than other gangliosides. Certain polysialo gangliosides induce cell-cell fusion when incubated with cells and one could speculate that the attachment of Sendai virus to the cell surface may stabilize a clustering of receptor molecules, so facilitating virus-cell fusion (Markwell et al., 198 1) .",

Thus, the authors examined absorption to red blood cells of two strains of influenza A virus (A/R1/5 -/57 and R l j 5 +/57). The HAS of the two viruses were found to have totally different specificities binding to the NeuAca2,3 Gal and NeuAccr2, 6 Gal linkages, respectively. Examination of the crystal structure of the HA shows that the host cell receptor cleft is distinct from the antigenic sites (Wiley et al., 1981) . So variations in receptor specificity could arise from natural selective pressures by host specified sialyloligosaccharides present on cell surface glycoproteins. In this case inhibitors of this receptor function might have to be rather specific, as mutants circumventing their activity might easily arise.",

It seems to be a general property of virus induced thymidine kinases (pyrimidine kinases) to have a less strict structural requirement for substrates than similar cell enzymes. Compounds such as acyclovir (Elion et al., 1977) , DHBG (Larsson et al., 1983) and BVDU (Cheng et al., 1981a) can be phosphorylated by the viral kinases but not by the cell thymidine kinases, thus leading to a selective activation only in virus infected cells. These phosphorylations are competitive reactions influenced by the concentration of thymidine (Larsson et al., 1983) . The further phosphorylation of the nucleoside monophosphates to di-and triphosphates seems to be carried out by cellular enzymes in competitive reactions that might be of importance for the final concentration of a nucleoside triphosphate. A large number of pyrimidine analogues have been found to be phosphorylated by herpesvirus thymidine kinase and some are discussed later in the chapter on herpesvirus inhibitors. A few are shown in Table 3 .3 where for example the difference in phosphorylation between cytosol and viral kinase is obvious. The mitochondria1 enzyme has a substrate specificity resembling that of the viral enzyme. The phosphorylations of purine analogues are mediated by cellular enzymes. It should be noted that the acyclic guanosine analogues are recognized by the TKs as pyrimidines but after phosphorylation to monophosphates they seem to be regarded as purine monophosphates and further phosphorylated by G M P kinase.",

A recent study of sequence specific contacts of vesicular stomatis virus (VSV) RNA polymerase on the leader RNA gene may therefore provide a model of this approach (Keene et al., 1981) . The RNA polymerase complex of VSV consists of the L, NS and N proteins and since transcription starts at the 3' terminus of the RNA it is assumed that the promoter for the polymerase resides in the leader gene. The authors utilized methylation protection to study sequence specific interactions with VSV RNA. The N protein rendered the RNA resistant to nuclease, although it did not alter the reactivity of the RNA to methylation by dimethyl sulphate (an alkylating agent). The binding of the polymerase L and NS proteins to the nucleocapsid was examined. When the NS protein was present the reactivity of RNA with dimethyl sulphate was altered in the middle of the leader gene. Thus, NS may function as an initiator protein for transcription by recognizing and binding to specific sites on the genome. The NS protein binds to the sequence:",

Smith et al. (1980) and Stridh et al. (1981) have described the RNA transcriptase inhibitory activity of certain polynudeotides. In common with the experiments described above these molecules inhibited a wide range of influenza A and B viruses. Indeed, this is a marked feature of such inhibitors, since, as far as is known, only minimal genetic variation occurs in the virus P and NP polypeptides of influenza viruses which together are considered to constitute RNA transcriptase enzyme activity. Smith et al. (1980) calculated that 50% inhibition of influenza RNA transcriptase activity occurred with only 4 molecules per RNA molecule and inhibition probably involved direct binding to the transcriptase enzyme. However, the polynucleotide compound has only mild antiviral activity in vivo (Potter et al., 1981) . ",

The virus mRNA uses cellular components such as initiation factors, ribosomes and t RNA in the synthesis of viral polypeptides but no effective antiviral drugs have been described which interfere with these steps. Cleavage of viral polypeptides is a common event and in the case of picornaviruses this cleavage is mediated by virus coded proteases. In addition, cleavage of the influenza haemagglutinin polypeptide (HA,, to HA, and HA2) is necessary for viral infectivity and is a possible target to block by an antiviral drug. Very little has been published in this area but as the sequence determinations and cleavage patterns for viral polypeptides become more clear it is likely that means of inhibiting these cleavages will be found. The use of protease inhibitors against influenza replication has been reported by Zhirnov et al. ( 1 982). Butterworth (1977) and Korant (1981) have reviewed the processing of viral polyproteins to viral proteins. Several important post-translational events such as glycosylation and phosphorylation of viral polypeptides occur. Compounds such as 2-deoxy-~-glucose and Dglucoseamine interfere with glycosylation and inhibit the multiplication of influenza and herpesvirus, but the compounds studied so far have not resulted in any antiviral drug with therapeutic activity in vivo.",

Inhibitors of viral protein phosphorylation and protein kinases have not been reported yet but are likely to come in the future. It is too early to judge the potential usefulness of compounds interfering with protein phosphorylation as possible antiviral drugs, but in this context it should be noted that one function of interferon is to induce a protein kinase which phosphorylates and impairs the activity of peptide chain initiation factor eIF-2, thus inhibiting protein synthesis (see Lengyel, 1982) .",

The induction of 2',5'-A (Fig. 3.6 ) seems to have a central role for antiviral activity. The synthesis of 2',5'-A, by one or more cellular enzymes induced by interferon (Laurent et al., 1983) , is balanced by degradation by an interferon induced enzyme (2'-Di) and the resulting 2',5'-A activates a latent ribonuclease (RNase L) which can degrade both mRNA, rRNA and viral RNA. Since 2',5'-A is rather labile, efforts have been made to synthesize analogues to 2',5'-A intended to be more stable and to activate RNase L. Several structural analogues to 2',5'-A have been synthesized with this intention (Epstein et al., 1982 , Kwiatkowski et al., 1982 , Sawai et al., 1983 , Haugh et al.. 1983 , and this is a very interesting approach. An increased stability can be obtained but the modified 2',5'-A is still a compound with a molecular weight too high for easy penetration into cells. This is an active area of research at present and improved compounds are to be expected. Their use would presumably be as broad range drugs against RNA viruses, but it is unclear at present if they will be sufficiently virus-specific and non-toxic to the cell. Overall et al. (1981) have determined the interferon concentration in herpes vesicles in humans and found it to be high but, in general, interferon production in a virus infected tissue has not been quantitated. The limited knowledge of actual and optimal levels of interferon in tissue during viral infections makes it difficult to predict the therapeutic efficacy of exogenously given interferon. There is a more obvious possibility of interferon as a prophylactic drug assuming that the toxicity is acceptable. Studies on the therapeutic and prophylactic use of interferon will be presented in the following chapters on each type of virus infection and the reader can judge for him/herself. The clinical use of interferon has been reviewed by Dunnick and Galasso (1979 Galasso ( , 1980 and Table 3 .9 lists some (but not all) clinical trials using interferon. In most cases the limited number of patients preclude an evaluation of clinical efficacy but it seems likely that the hopes that interferon would turn out to be a new wonder drug were grossly exaggerated. However, most likely there will be situations where it can be used both for prophylaxis and therapy, and probably also in combination with other antiviral drugs.",

The rapid progress in our understanding of immunological processes makes it likely that in the future it will be possible to design compounds with therapeutic or prophylactic efficacy against viral infections. However, the compounds tested so far, levamisole and inosiplex, have shown little, if any, effect. The mechanism of action of levamisole is to increase phagocytosis, cellmediated immune responses and polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis. The use in herpes and papilloma infections seems doubtful (Russel, 1980) but it might (Van Eygen et al., 1979) . Inosiplex (isoprinisone) seems to restore T-lymphocyte function which has been depressed by a viral infection and can possibly also augment interferon action (Werner, 1979) . The usefulness of inosiplex is at present unclear and will have to await further double-blind placebo-controlled trials (Chang and Heel, 198 1, Editorial, Lancet 1982) . A combination of immunomodulators and selective antiviral drugs is a possibility that has not been explored.",

For example, it is likely that topical application for herpetic infections will pose more penetration problems on dry skin than on mucous membranes or the cornea of the eye. It is also likely that the vehicle and method of application could be as important as the drug used. A general problem is, and will be, the need to use an antiviral drug at the very onset of the infection. Because of the often very rapid course of the disease, this will require a rapid diagnosis and preferably a direct delivery of the medication to the affected skin by a topical application or to the infected upper airways by an aerosol. A correct diagnosis by the patient and the appropriate drug at hand is a goal as far as rapidly progressing viral diseases like cold sores, genital herpes, common colds and influenza are concerned. Infections with a more prolonged course of virus replication, such as those in immunocompromised patients, might be easier targets for antiviral drugs.",

It is clear that use of antiviral drugs in cell cultures results in a selection of drug resistant virus. It is equally clear that the selection of drug resistant bacteria is a more rapid process, perhaps not surprisingly since the replication time of a virus is in the order of several hours and that of bacteria is less than half an hour.

Information about inactive structures is helpful in the search for active inhibitors, but unfortunately, mostly the active inhibitors are reported in the scientific literature, and not the compounds tested and found to be inactive! In some screening programmes a thorough evaluation of the cell-toxic properties is carried out before animal experiments start (Stenberg, 1981) . By this procedure a considerable number of toxic inhibitors can be eliminated at an early stage and this reduces the number of animal experiments required.

The safety evaluation in animals is very expensive but it should be realized that the animal studies are models and in the first human trial a limited number of volunteers has to be carefully monitored for any adverse effects. Evaluation of clinical efficacy in humans is a large and difficult part of the development of an antiviral drug. The number of uncontrolled clinical studies claiming efficacy of different drugs against viral diseases is depressingly large. It is essential to perform double-blind, placebo-controlled and statistically well evaluated studies to be able to judge the clinical efficacy of an antiviral drug. A praiseworthy high standard in these respects has been shown in the studies carried out in the US by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) programme on antiviral substances. These studies could in many respects serve as guidelines for proper clinical evaluation, especially of antiherpes drugs (see Chapters 1 I , 12 for further details).",

Methods such as X-ray diffraction measurement and NMR determinations will probably lead to a detailed understanding of the structures and interactions taking place at the active site of viral enzymes and their cellular counterparts. This could hopefully result in a rational, computer aided design of compounds with high selectivity for the viral enzymes. We also need a more detailed insight into the natural history of some viral diseases to be able to choose the right approach for inhibition. The development of rapid diagnosis of viral infections is an important complement to the development of new antiviral drugs. Ideally the method should make a correct diagnosis possible within half an hour. Sensitive methods using immunological principles and monoclonal antibodies or nucleic acid hybridization are being developed but will require simplification to be generally accessible.",

In this important area international agencies or countries themselves should consider a cost-benefit analysis for developing an antiviral drug. If this consideration turns out in favour of the development of a drug then the actual research work is probably most efficiently carried out by contract to an existing pharmaceutical company or institute. This type of arrangement has not been tried to date for antiviral drugs but should have obvious applications for virus infections in developing countries as well as for rare infections in the industrialized world. Ironically it is also possible that the more or less secret development of antiviral agents against viruses potentially useful in biological warfare or of other military importance could result in therapies against infections such as yellow fever, Japanese B encephalitis and other togavirus infections.",
