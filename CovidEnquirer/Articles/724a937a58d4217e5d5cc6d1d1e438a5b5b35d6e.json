For the last five years, 75.6% of the total food poisonings were related to cafeterias and restaurants dealing sea foods such as fishes and shellfishes. School cafeterias had outbreaks during March and September beginning of the semester, and restaurants, between May and September when the temperature has risen. Pathogenic E.coli, salmonella, staphylococcus, vibrio, campylobacter jejuni and norovirus were the leading organisms of food material contamination and poor personal hygiene. Especially, the food poisonings during winter period, norovirus accounted for 42% [6] . Despite this increasing tendency, the reported cases of acute diarrheal syndrome (mass type) by the EDSS were decreased instead. Besides, comparing the reports from the KFDA in 2007, the reports were unreasonably insufficient to enable early detection and alerting an early warning system of food poisonings. ",

Of course, there are limitations that participating emergency departments in the syndromic surveillance is limited to 125 organs and that some degree of patients might seek for medical services besides emergency departments, such as private clinics or outpatient departments. But considering the fact that the data from the KFDA and the Korean CDC are both from the same population, and that both groups should at least follow the same trends of rise or fall, the study results are not comprehensible. After all, the factor that can cause these discrepancies, which the Korean EDSS is currently facing, is that the report rates could be dependant on the reporter's education level and their wills to report [3] . Meanwhile the Anti-Bioterrorism Information Network reveals every emergency department's report rates and their rankings in the website and forces them to actively participate. The city, county and borough public health centers also urge those emergency departments who haven't submitted their daily reports. These measures may increase the report rates, but they can not improve their accuracies. After all, limitations of the Korean EDSS including lack of compulsory manners, not being automatically linked to electronic medical record, and the different reporting process in data reporting system between the Korean CDC and the KFDA, might have brought out the large discrepancies in our study.",

            "text": "EDSS was introduced as the epidemics of infectious diseases and bioterrorismal threats were issued globally. If performed effectively, it could offer great opportunities for early detection and preparedness for the target diseases or accidents like bioterrorism. It is crucial to systematize its adoption and application, and successive amelioration of current system is indispensable. Attempts to improve accuracies in the EDSS were made. Beitel et al. [4] , in their study of pediatric population, reported that using the ICD-9 code alone or in combination with the chief complaint code improved identification of respiratory syndromes than using the chief complaint code alone, and Fleischauer et al. [5] reported the ICD-9 code provides better performance than the chief complaint code in the EDSS. But the limitations in using the diagnostic code are the variance in coding, errors in input, time consumption until the diagnosis being made and changes in the confirmative diagnosis after short term emergency care. On the contrary, using the chief complaint enables early detection, one of the main objects in surveillance system, and therefore numerous medical institute use this code in their surveillance systems [11, 12] . Some studies stress on the capability of early detection, and to improve the sensitivity of surveillance system, they modified their preexisting chief complaint codes by adding other chief complaints that were not related to specific disease and were not included previously [4] . Despite diverse attempts in improving syndromic surveillance performance in other countries, the Korean EDSS still maintains the method of inputting data manually to the computer by the reporter's judgment. After all, accurate data couldn't be reported, and the EDSS could not play its role properly. Our institution developed our own EDSS program named Emergency Room Syndrome Surveillance (Figure 4 ). Its main purpose was to enable the emergency department administrator to detect early the increase in the number of target syndromes visiting emergency room, and to allow the emergency practitioners for preliminary actions towards the target syndromes, so they could serve as a frontline vigilance in our own hospital. It is automated, real time monitoring system. Data regarding target syndromes are gathered automatically. This process is carried out by collecting the daily numbers of patients' chief complaints which are related to target syndromes, and total number of each syndromic patient is displayed in our electronic medical record system. So whenever the number of target syndromic patient is increased much more than previous data, emergency doctors and nurses can specifically pay attention to the related disease and be prepared. If the program mentioned above were applied to the Korean EDSS, improvement of the accuracy of the system's performance by ameliorating the passive and manual method of daily reports could be expected.",

After all, due to the data input and reporting manners, which are the major limitations of current Korean EDSS, our surveillance system could not attain its original purpose, early and accurate detection of disease outbreaks.",

Apt role could provide timely actions to cope with the disease, which is essential in dealing with bioterrorism. Buehler et al. [13] . pointed out that the following factors must be fulfilled in achieving effectiveness of the EDSS. First, surveillance system must be highly sensitive, second, the system should have high positive predictive value and third, system needs to be capable of early detection. Current EDSS in Korea has major defect in accuracy of data collecting system, which hampers early detection and preparedness of disease outbreak. Henceforth, to improve reliability, data collection must be automated by linking electronic medical record rather than daily inputting system by the reporters, and further improvements and studies are required.",
