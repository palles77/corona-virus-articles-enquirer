Sariola. 1992. J. Cell Sci. 102:505-513) inhibition of transport by caffeine at 20~ Recovery of the Golgi complex from brefeldin A (BFA) treatment was inhibited by caffeine at reduced temperature (20~ suggesting that caffeine inhibits the membrane traffic between the ER and the Golgi complex. Caffeine at 20~ did not inhibit the BFA-induced retrograde movement of the Golgi membranes. Further, incubation of the cells in 10 mM caffeine at 20~ had profound effects on the distribution and the organization of the pre-Golgi and the Golgi stack membranes. Caffeine treatment at 20~ resulted in a selective and reversible translocation of the pre-and cis-Golgi marker protein (p58) to the periphery of the cell. This caffeine-induced effect on the Golgi complex was different from that induced by BFA, since mannosidase II, a Golgi stack marker, remained perinucleady located and the Golgi stack coat protein, B-COP, was not detached from Golgi membranes in the presence of 10 mM caffeine at 20~ Electron microscopic analysis showed that, in the presence of caffeine at 20~ the morphology of the Golgi stack was altered and accumulation of numerous small vesicles in the Golgi region was observed. The results in the present study suggest that caffeine at reduced temperature (20~ reveals a functional interface between the pre-Golgi and the Golgi stack.",

            "text": "Reduced temperature has been widely used to dissect transport steps in the exocytotic transport pathway (for review see Saraste and Kuismanen, 1992) . Specifically, incubation at 15~ blocks the transport at the pre-Golgi level (Saraste and Kuismanen, 1984) and has led to the characterization of p58, a resident protein in the pre-and cis-Golgi compartments (Saraste et al., 1987) . The depletion of cellular ATP has been shown to inhibit distinct steps in vesicular transport (Balch et al., 1986; Tartakoff, 1986) . The important role of calcium in vesicular traffic between the ER and the Golgi compartment has become evident from in vitro studies (Beckers and Balch, 1989; Sambrook, 1990) . Also, the perturbation of intraceUular Ca2+-levels blocks the movement of secretory proteins out from the rough ER (Ix)dish and Kong, 1990 ). In addition, lowered extraceUular pH has been reported to arrest the transport of influenza virus hemagglutinin at the pre-Golgi level (Matlin et al., 1988) . The central role of GTP in the vesicular transport has become evident from in vitro studies where the nonhydrolyz-able GTP-analogue, GTP-3,-S, has been used to inhibit ERto-Golgi transport both in mammalian and yeast ceils (Beckers and Balch, 1989; Ruohola et al., 1988) . Recent localization of the small GTP-binding proteins rablb and rab2 to the membranes responsible for the ER-to-Golgi transport has further emphasized the role of GTP as a regulator of ER-to-Golgi membrane traffic (Chavrier et al., 1990; Plutner et al., 1991) . Interestingly, there is also evidence for the participation of trimeric GTP-binding proteins in the regulation of membrane traffic (Stow et al., 1991; Barr et al., 1991) , thus revealing a link between signal transduction and the processes in the intracellular membrane traffic (for review see Balch, 1992; Barr et al., 1992) . Okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor, has been shown to inhibit ER-to-Golgi transport (Davison et al., 1992) and result in the fragmentation and dispersal of the Golgi apparatus (Lucocq et al., 1991) , further linking mechanisms of signal transduction and the endomembrane traffic.",

BFA was first reported to block the transport of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (Takatsuki and Tamura, 1985) . Later it has been shown that BFA treatment results in the fusion of the Golgi membranes with the ER (Doms et al., 1989; Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1989 , 1991a Strous et al., 1991) . The almost immediate effect of BFA is to detach at least two of the coat components-/3-COP ) and a 200-kD protein (Narula et al., 1992 )-from the Golgi stack, allowing Golgi membranes to form tubular extensions along microtubules that finally fuse with the ER . This effect of BFA has been proposed to reveal a normally occurring retrograde membrane traffic from the Golgi apparatus to the ER (Doms et al., 1989; Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1989; Klausner et al., 1992) . BFA has also been reported to have effects on the organization of the endocytic compartment; TGN and endosomes form large tubular structures after a BFA treatment (Wood et al., 1991; Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1991b; Reaves and Banting, 1992) .",

In contrast, under the same conditions a Golgi stack marker, mannosidase II (man II), remains perinuclearly located. The redistribution of membranes induced by caffeine is clearly different from that induced by BFA. Further, caffeine at reduced temperature did not inhibit the retrograde movement of Golgi stack membranes observed in BFA-treated cells.

Determination of the temperature threshold allowing SFV E1 to reach the Golgi in the presence (a) or absence (b) of 10 mM caffeine. BHK-21 cells were infected with SFV ts-1 temperature-sensitive mutant, labeled with [35S]methionine and chased in the presence or absence of 10 mM caffeine at 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, and 28~ for 3 h. The cells were then solubilized, immunoprecipitated with monospecific polyclonal antibodies to SFV El, treated with Endo H, and run in a 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. From a it can be observed that SFV E1 remains Endo H sensitive in the presence of 10 mM caffeine up to 240C. E1 becomes gradually resistant to Endo H treatment at 250C and at higher temperatures, indicating the arrival of E1 to the Golgi stack. In b the sensitivity of E1 to Endo H treatment in the absence of caffeine at different temperatures is shown. In the absence of caffeine, E1 becomes Endo H resistant already at 20~ (b). P, pulse. temperature threshold that allows SFV E1 membrane glycoprotein to reach the Golgi stack in the presence of caffeine was analyzed by following the maturation of SFV El-linked glycans to the Endo H-resistant form. We also carried out immunofluorescence experiments to analyze the exact temperature that allows SFV glycoproteins to exit the ER. These experiments together should further reveal whether caffeine at reduced temperature could arrest the ER-to-Golgi traffic in possible intermediate steps.",

The experiments may further indicate that SFV glycoproteins are able, at least in some degree, to escape to peripheral vesicular structures already at 240C when still possessing clearly Endo H-sensitive glycans. However, to further clarify this issue, morphological colocalization experiments with a marker to the pre-Golgi membranes will be necessary.",

To test the effect of 10 mM caffeine and 20~ on the movement of cellular proteins, we followed the recovery of Golgi membranes from BFA treatment using as a marker man II, a resident Golgi membrane protein. BFA has recenrly been shown to cause the redistribution of man II and other resident Golgi proteins as well as Golgi membranes to the ER in a reversible manner (Doms et al., 1989; Fujiwara et al., 1988; Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1989 , 1991a Strous et al., 1991) . BHK-21 cells were treated for 90 min with 2 #g/ml of BFA at 37~ to ensure complete translocation of man II to the ER. To follow the movement of man II out of the ER, BFA was removed with several washes of preconditioned medium (20~ in the presence or absence of 10 mM caffeine. Thereafter, the cells were chased for 60, 120, and 180 min at 20~ with (Fig. 3 , d, f, and h, respectively) or without (Fig. 3 , c, e, and g, respectively) caffeine, and then fixed and prepared for immunofluorescence. In Fig.  3 a, the distribution of man II is shown before any drug treatments. In cells treated for 90 min with BFA at 370C, man Figure 2 .

At 240C (f), a few cells possess also vesicular labeling ~ arrow). At 25~ in more than half of the cells, SFV glycoproteins can exit the ER and accumulate to perinuclear structures (g). At 28~ virtually all cells show perinuclear localization of El (h). Bar, 20/~m. II is translocated efficiently (in 99 % of the cells) to the ER (Fig. 3 b) . As the cells were incubated for 60 min in a caffeine-free medium at 20~ (Fig. 3 c) , man II appears in peripheral and more central elements (in 47 % of the cells), and also in the ER. After a 120-min chase in caffeine-free medium at 20~ the ER was efficiently emptied and man II was found in a few peripheral elements, but was mainly perinuclearly located (Fig. 3 e) (in 95 % of the cells). After 180 min in caffeine-free medium, man II was found perinuclearly located with no detectable labeling in the ER (Fig. 3 g) (in 98 % of the cells). When the cells were chased after the removal of the BFA in the presence of 10 mM caffeine at 20~ for 60 min, man II failed to exit the ER (Fig.  3 d) (in 98% of the cells). After a 120- (Fig. 3 f ) or 180-rain (Fig. 3 h) chase in the presence of caffeine, man II was still located in the ER (in 94 and 96 % of the ceils, respectively). These results show that 10 mM caffeine and 20~ inhibited efficiently the movement of man II, a resident Golgi membrane protein, out from the ER. This may further suggest that caffeine at reduced temperature inhibits the recovery of the Golgi from the BFA treatment and thus inhibits the membrane traffic from the ER to the Golgi complex, Figure 3 . 10 mM caffeine at 20~ inhibits the movement of man II out from the ER. a shows the normal distribution of man II in BHK-21 cells.

When the cells were treated with 5/zg/ml of BFA supplemented with 10 mM caffeine at 20~ for 60 min (Fig. 4 d) , man II was found in the ER in 68 % of the cells and in the perinuclear localization in 92 % of the cells.

BHK-21 cells were grown for 30 min at 20\"C in the presence (a and b) or absence (c and d) of 10 mM caffeine, fixed, and double-labeled with antibodies to p58 (a and c) and man II (b and d). The distribution of p58 can be seen to change dramatically after a caffeine treatment at 20\"C. In a, p58 can be found scattered through the cytoplasma in contrast to control cells at 20~ (c), where p58 is concentrated in the perinuclear region of the cell in addition to some labeling in peripheral vesicles. When the localization of p58 is compared with the localization of man II in caffeine-treated and in control cells incubated at 20~ p58 can be seen to colocalize only randomly with man II in caffeine-treated cells (a for p58 and b for man II), but to colocalize a great deal in control cells (c for p58 and d for man II). Also, the localization of man II seems not to be affected by the caffeine treatment at 20~ (b). Bar, 20 #m. man II seems to occur more slowly than in the control cells at the 60-min time point by a factor of 1.5, at the 120-min time point by a factor of 1.8, and at the 180-min time point by a factor of 1.6. Thus, these results indicate that caffeine does not inhibit the effect of BFA, but it does appear to slow it down somewhat. Interestingly, it seems that during a 180min chase at 20~ both in caffeine-treated and in control cells the BFA-induced translocation of man II reaches a steady-state situation after a 120-min incubation, whereafter no significant chances in the distribution of man II in the cells seems to occur.",

BHK-21 cells were treated for 30, 60, or 120 min with or without 10 mM caffeine at 20~ fixed, and labeled with a polyclonal antibody to p58 and a monoclonal antibody to man II (135 kD). Surprisingly, after 30 min at 20~ in the presence of Figure 6 . The caffeine-induced translocation of p58 to the periphery of the cells is reversible. BHK-21 cells were incubated in the presence (20~ caffeine) or absence (20 ~ C control) of 10 mM caffeine at 20~ for 60 rain. Cells incubated at 20~ with caffeine were further incubated 60 rain without caffeine at 20~ (reversion), fixed, and doubled-labeled with antibodies to p58 and man II. no drug shows the normal distribution of p58 and man II in BHK-21 cells. In reversion, the perinuclear localization of p58, similar to that in 20~ control, is restored. Bar, 20 #m. caffeine, p58 was found scattered throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 5 a) whereas man II still remained concentrated in a perinuclear localization (Fig. 5 b) . Incubation for an additional 30 or 90 min showed similar distribution of p58 and man II (data not shown) (see also Fig. 6 for a 60-rain incubation). In control cells, incubated for 30 rain at 20~ p58 and man I1 (Fig. 5, c and d, respectively) were found to colocalize largely, except for the peripheral vesicles positive only for p58. Fig. 5 , a and c, demonstrates that p58 is translocated away from its normal perinuclear localization at 20~ in the presence of 10 mM caffeine. In caffeine-treated cells, the colocalization of p58 (Fig. 5 a) and man II (Fig. 5 b) oc-curred only rarely. Even though the majority of the p58 protein seemed to move to the periphery of the cell in the presence of caffeine at 20~ some p58-positive vesicles still colocalized with the perinuclear elements also labeled with antibodies to man II. This could partly be due to an apparent colocalization of not the same but closely adjacent structures. These results suggest that 10 mM caffeine at 20~ induces a translocation of p58-positive, pre-Golgi, and cis-Golgi membranes to the periphery of the cells leaving man II-positive membranes perinuclearly located.",

After incubation for an additional 60 min in the absence of caffeine at 20~ the localization of p58 was compared with that at normal temperature (37~ and to that at 20~ without caffeine. In addition, the localization of p58 was compared with that of man II in the same cells. In untreated cells, p58 is located perinuclearly with some labeling in small peripheral vesicles and ER as reported earlier (Saraste and Svensson, 1991) (Fig. 6, no drug) . In cells treated with caffeine at 20~ for 60 min (Fig. 6, 20~ caffeine), the bulk of p58 becomes distributed throughout the cytoplasm while man II still remains perinuclearly located. On the contrary, in control cells without caffeine at 20~ p58 was concentrated to the Golgi area and colocalized with man II (Fig. 6, 20~ control) . The normal localization of p58 was restored when the cells maintained for 60 min in the presence of 10 mM caffeine at 20~ were further incubated for 60 min at 20~ in a caffeine-free medium (Fig.   6, reversion) . The observed reversible translocation of preand cis-Golgi marker protein to the periphery of the cell and the unaltered distribution of a Golgi stack marker protein suggest that caffeine at reduced temperature can be used to manipulate pre-and cis-Golgi elements without affecting the localization of Golgi stack membranes.",

The distribution and morphology of p58positive elements in BHK-21 cells after incubation at 20~ in the presence of 10 mM caffeine resembled that observed earlier in BFA-treated cells. Even though incubation at 20~ in the presence of caffeine did not result in the movement of a resident Golgi stack marker to the ER (see Fig. 5 b) , it did cause profound effects on the organization of the Golgi complex (see Fig. 7 a) . ~COP, a protein known to be associated with the pre-Golgi and the Golgi stack membranes (Duden et al., 1991) is released rapidly from the Golgi membranes in cells treated with BFA . We therefore tested whether caffeine would have an effect on the localization of E-COP. BHK-21 cells were incubated at 20~ in the presence or absence of 10 mM caffeine, fixed, and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy. In Fig. 9 a, the distribution of E-COP is shown in cells before any treatments. ~COP has a strong perinuclear localization and also the labeling of cytoplasmic vesicular elements is observed (Fig. 9 a) . When cells were incubated at 20~ for 60 min in the absence of caffeine (Fig. 9 b) , the distribution of /~-COP was essentially the same as in control cells without any treatments (Fig. 9 a) . A 60-min incubation at 20~ with 10 mM caffeine did not have any detectable effect on the distribution of/~-COP (Fig. 9 c) . Because of the strong perinuclear labeling of E-COP, possible changes in the distribution of pre-and cis-Golgi elements were undetectable in the experiment. This result nevertheless suggests that BFA and caffeine affect the membranes of the Golgi complex through different mechanisms.",

Some variation, however, was observed in the temperature dependence between individual cells close to the threshold temperature. Therefore, in other experiments, 20~ in the presence of caffeine was used. To study whether the transport of cellular proteins is also affected, man II was translocated with BFA to the ER, whereafter BFA was washed away and the movement of man II was followed in the absence or presence of 10 mM caffeine at 20~ As was the case with virus proteins, man II was unable to exit from the ER in the presence of 10 mM caffeine at 20~ during a 180-min chase. In contrast, during a 180-min chase in the control cells, ER was efficiently emptied and man II accumulated perinuclearly in the absence of caffeine at 20~ It is therefore suggested that caffeine affects the movement of membranes between the ER and the Golgi complex. It is, however, necessary to follow the movement of other cellular proteins and, for example, lipids between the ER and the Golgi in the presence of caffeine at reduced temperature to obtain a clear picture of this matter. We have also tested that the ER-exit inhibition by caffeine functions in SFV-infected normal rat kidney cells (data not shown), indicating that the observed effect is not specific for one cell type.",

Nevertheless, already after a 60-min chase in the presence of caffeine at 20~ 68% of the cells showed labeling in the ER and long tubular structures emanating from the Golgi complex. These results show that caffeine does not inhibit the BFA-induced retrograde Golgi-to-ER transport, although the traffic in the opposite (ER-to-Golgi) direction, is inhibited. Also, since caffeine at 20~ did not inhibit the BFA-induced retrograde movement of Golgi membranes, known to be inhibited by the GTP-,y-S (Tan et al., 1992) , it seems unlikely that the effect of caffeine would be due to caffeine mimicking GTP-3,-S.",

This result is in agreement with the immunofluorescence observations with man II. Since the perinuclear localization of the Golgi complex in the cell is dependent on the integrity of the microtubules (Thyberg and Moskalewski, 1985; Kreis, 1990) , it is unlikely that caffeine at 20~ would act through disrupting the microtubular network. This is further supported by the fact that also in caffeine-treated cells the BFA-induced tubular, microtubuledependent structures were able to form. One possible explanation for the caffeineinduced vesicularization of the Golgi stack could be that when the transport from the ER to the Golgi complex is inhibited, while the vesicular recycling in the Golgi stack is still occurring, the Golgi stack ultimately becomes vesicularized.",

When the localization of p58 was studied with immunoelectron microscopy in caffeine-treated cells at 20~ the typical tubulovesicular p58-positive elements (Saraste and Svensson, 1991) were absent from the Golgi region and p58 was found only to be localized in a few small vesicles associated with the clusters of vesicles in the Golgi region. Even though immunoperoxidase technique is by no means a quantitative method, when compared with the control cells, the number of p58-positive membrane elements in the Golgi region seemed to be lower in caffeine-treated cells at reduced temperature. The statement that p58 is translocated away from the perinuclear 1o-calization in caffeine-treated cells is based on the results obtained in the immunofluorescence experiments, where distribution of the bulk of p58 can be observed. Overall, the immunoelectron microscopic finding is in agreement with the immunofluorescence result in Fig. 5 a. As suggested by the immunofluorescence experiments, the bulk of the p58 seems to be translocated away from the perinuclear localization in caffeine-treated cells. These resuits suggest that caffeine and reduced temperature are able to induce a selective retrograde translocation of pre-and cis-Golgi membranes while the localization of the Golgi stack membranes remains unaffected. This was further confirmed by the unaffected localization of/~-COP protein. Possible explanation to the observed loss of the perinuclear labeling of p58 could be that in the presence of caffeine the pre-and cis-Golgi elements are induced to move toward the periphery of the cell. Another possibility is that as the membrane traffic from the ER is inhibited and at least the BFA-induced retrograde movement of membranes is not inhibited, p58 could finally be recycled to the ER, being unable to exit from there. Whatever the solution turns out to be, caffeine seems to make it possible to manipulate the membranes operating in the ER-to-Golgi traffic in a novel way. Interestingly, Lewis and Pelham (1992) have recently shown that, by overexpressing the ligand for the KDEL receptor, the bulk of the receptor is translocated to the ER.",

            "text": "To obtain a more detailed picture of the effect of caffeine and reduced temperature on the membranes operating between the ER and the Golgi complex, it is necessary to study whether the distribution of other markers for these membranes such as p53 (Schweizer et al., 1988) , Corona virus E1 glycoprotein (Machamer et al., 1990) , and rab2 (Chavrier et al., 1990) , is also affected. Caffeine at reduced temperature on the one hand inhibited the exit of proteins from the ER and on the other hand induced a selective translocation of pre-and cis-Golgi membranes to peripheral locations; this is in contrast to the BFA action which seems to translocate unselectively all Golgi membranes from their normal perinuclear location (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1989 , 1991a Doms et al., 1989; Fujiwara et al., 1988; Strous et al., 1991) . Further, caffeine did not detach H-COP from the Golgi membranes nor did it translocate man II to the ER. Thus, the effect of caffeine on the organization of the membranes between the ER and the Golgi complex is clearly different from that induced by BFA. The different effect of BFA and caffeine on the Golgi complex would indicate that the Golgi complex is composed of two subsets of homotypic membranes differentially sensitive to caffeine treatment. Whether this is also reflected in the differences of the coat structures of these membranes remains to be seen.",
