We compared the demands of various scenarios with estimates of maximum ICU capacity, factoring in healthcare worker absenteeism as well as reported and realistic estimates derived from semistructured telephone interviews with key management in ICUs in the study area. We show that even during the peak of the pandemic, most patients requiring ICU admission may be served, even those who have non-infl uenza-related conditions, provided that strong indications and decision-making rules are maintained for admission as well as for continuation (or discontinuation) of life support. Such a model should be integral to a preparedness plan for a pandemic with a new human-transmissible agent.",

Attack rate, hospital and ICU length of stay, and death rate can only accurately be factored in after a new virus has emerged (3) . Therefore, almost all assumptions in the models published to date have drawn on the knowledge obtained from the large 20th-century pandemics (12) (13) (14) .

Under Dutch law, UMCG has an important role in the event of an avian infl uenza pandemic, not only for the patient population that it serves but also as a regional coordinating center (15) . Training courses that emphasized the need to enhance collaboration and communication for pandemic infl uenza were held with regional and municipal health authorities, general practitioners, and representatives of all hospitals in the northern region. We present a model, similar to models by Anderson et al. (16) for Australia and New Zealand and Menon et al. for England (14) . We show that increased hospitalization in combination with healthcare worker (HCW) absenteeism will have a substantial, but in our model manageable, effect on hospital and ICU bed occupancy. Furthermore, we discuss the choices to be made for ongoing, non-infl uenzarelated emergencies during an infl uenza pandemic and the effect of enhancing the contingency plans already in place. Although surge capacity of hospital resources is typically limited (1), we explored whether, under specifi ed assumptions and appropriate planning and training, a pandemic is manageable.",

Data on population (\u22481.7 million) and age distribution (Table 1) were obtained from publicly available sources. The age distribution in the Dutch population data were provided in 5-year groupings, and we therefore converted these data to an even distribution to allow for calculations with the Flu-Surge program (14) . Data on total hospital beds, ICU beds, and number of nurses and their full-time equivalents were obtained from publicly available sources (18) . ICU capacity was also obtained from reports from hospital administrators during training sessions for pandemic infl uenza in May 2006, organized by the public health authorities in the region. These data on reported ICU capacity were discussed during a semistructured telephone interview with ICU medical staff in August 2006. Using these data, we estimated the regular bed capacity and maximal surge capacity. Data on the impact of a pandemic infl uenza on healthcare services were adopted from the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) (19, 20) . RIVM presented tables for 25% and 50% disease attack rates, representing best and worst case scenarios. From these tables we calculated the 30% attack rate (percentage of the population that becomes ill) by linear transformation. A 30% attack rate is the most likely scenario, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and is defi ned as the most likely scenario by RIVM.",

            "text": "We present the impact of a pandemic with new human-transmissible infl uenza on hospital resources in the northern part of the Netherlands. Using the fi gures of the RIVM, and assuming a 30% cumulative disease attack rate, we estimated that \u224812% of the population will consult a general practitioner ( Table 2 ). The percentage of persons triaged for hospital admission is 0.3%. We assumed excess deaths among these selected patients, some 50% of whom may require mechanical ventilation (Figure 1 ). In the northern part of the Netherlands 5,629 regular hospital beds are available. The hospitals in this region have a total of 30% (non-infl uenza-related) acute care, which would leave 3,940 regular hospital beds that could be made available for infl uenza-related hospital admissions. If the attack rate reaches a maximum of 50% with a mean length of stay of 15 hospital days per patient, without any intervention, this would lead to a peak of 1,227 occupied regular hospital beds, which would suffi ce for infl uenza-related acute care. Therefore, we centered our calculations around the peak occupancy of intensive care beds. We calculated the number of hospital admissions per week, spread evenly across 7 days in the respective week, and we subtracted the number of deaths, also evenly spread across the week. We assumed that 25%-50% of total hospital admission patients would require some form of mechanical ventilator support, and we provide calculations for the extremes of our estimates. On the basis of results from a semistructured telephone interview with ICU medical staff of the hospitals in the 3 northern provinces, a maximum of 136 (of a total of 200) ICU beds could be dedicated to infl uenza-related acutecare patients. We estimate that 90 ICU beds will be made available in a short period. In the scenario of no additional intervention, if the full capacity of all 136 ICU beds is used, with an attack rate of 30%, 25% ICU admissions, and a mean length of stay of 8 days, we would have a shortage of 3 ICU beds at day 28 after onset, when we expect the pandemic to peak. This shortage in ICU capacity is exacerbated with any increase in hospital length of stay or ICU length of stay. HCWs would become ill in the pandemic in proportion to the attack rate in the general population, and we illustrated the impact of HCW absenteeism on loss of ICU bed capacity for all presented scenarios (Figures 1, 2) . Furthermore, we visualized the effect of intensifi ed treatment decisions on the occupancy of ICU beds (Figure 2 ). For this situation, we used the representative case scenario estimate data, i.e., 30% attack rate and a mean length of stay of 8 days, and show the effect of intensifi ed treatment decision resulting in reduction of ICU occupancy by 5% and 20%. Intensifi ed treatment decision was defi ned as discon- tinuation of mechanical ventilation after 48 hours, based on ample consultations within ICU teams and with partners and next of kin of patients that the patients are deemed to have no realistic hope for recovery. Finally, we made sensitivity analyses, with changing assumptions within the model; this additional material is presented in an online Technical Appendix (available from www.cdc.gov/EID/ content/13/11/1714-Techapp.pdf).",

As a novel element we include calculations for HCW absenteeism. We have not considered potential erosion of professionalism with increased absenteeism due to fear and panic among staff or due to staff members' caring for sick family members. Although morale was high during the SARS outbreak in Singapore and Toronto (23), some examples of strained professional behavior have been reported (24) . We believe that erosion of professionalism and morale may be partly preventable by implementing effective protection for HCWs (25, 26) , with appropriate training to comply with protocols for personal protection. For a new pandemic, the important issues to factor in are magnitude and duration, calculation of staff shortages, and the limited capacity to call in external resources.",

Without withdrawing or withholding life support to those deemed to have no realistic chance of survival, the system is bound to collapse (Figure 2 ). With appropriate patient management, however, adequate healthcare can be provided even during the peak of the pandemic. We recognize the ethical impact this has on the clinicians and nurses who have to make these decisions. Many clinicians now realize that end-oflife decisions are an integral part of healthcare (27) and can be considered independent of any specifi c religious background or culture (28) . ICU staff in the Netherlands have been trained to take charge of decision processes about foregoing life support in the ICU (27) . They are aware of potential diffi culties in communicating with members of the ICU team, including medical, nursing, and technical staff in decisions at the end of life. The challenge during an outbreak of pandemic infl uenza will be in orchestrating and implementing these decisions under extreme time pressure. Relatives of patients as well as team members may need more time than available to accept that some patients on life support who are not responding to treatment will not recover. Some may insist on continuation of support, although it would be unwise and possibly disrespectful to these patients to continue futile treatment and unfair to others who might have been saved if those resources had been available. A generous and time-consuming approach may not apply under the anticipated extreme conditions of pandemic infl uenza (27) .",
