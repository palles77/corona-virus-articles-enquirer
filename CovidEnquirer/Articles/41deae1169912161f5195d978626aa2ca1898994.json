We developed a chimeric virus-like particle (VLP)-based candidate vaccine for IBV protection. The chimeric VLP was composed of matrix 1 protein from avian influenza H5N1 virus and a fusion protein neuraminidase (NA)/spike 1 (S1) that was generated by fusing IBV S1 protein to the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of NA protein of avian influenza H5N1 virus. The chimeric VLPs elicited significantly higher S1-specific antibody responses in intramuscularly immunized mice and chickens than inactivated IBV viruses. Furthermore, the chimeric VLPs induced significantly higher neutralization antibody levels than inactivated H120 virus in SPF chickens. Finally, the chimeric VLPs induced significantly higher IL-4 production in mice. These results demonstrate that chimeric VLPs have the potential for use in vaccines against IBV infection.",

            "text": "Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing virus infection and controlling the spread of IBV. Both inactivated and live attenuated virus vaccines have been used to protect chickens against IBV [4, 9] . Inactivated virus vaccines are produced from IBV-infected allantoic fluids, but do not illicit high levels of S1-specific antibody responses [33] . Live attenuated viruses offer long lasting and protective immunity, but pose the risk of returning to virulent form and co-infection with Escherichia coli or other bacteria [10, 34] . Accordingly, it is necessary to develop a new IBV vaccine. Spike (S) protein, one of the four structural proteins of IBV, is a heavily glycosylated spike glycoprotein expressed on virion surfaces [13] . This protein be cleaved into two subunits, N-terminal S1 and C-terminal S2. The S1 subunit, which is the bulbous head of the S protein, is responsible for attachment of the virus to cells [7] . Analysis of S-specific monoclonal antibodies has shown that many of the amino acids of virus neutralization (VN) epitopes are located within the first and third quarters of the linear S1 polypeptide [11, 12, 19] . Immune responses induced by the S1 subunit have been studied using S1 protein prepared from purified virus and derived from baculovirus-based expression systems [16, 23, 33] . Virus-like particles (VLPs) are multi-protein structures that mimic the organization and conformation of authentic native viruses without viral genomes. VLPs are generated by assembling structural viral proteins and lipids into particles [18, 30] . VLPs have been widely investigated for use in the development of safe and effective vaccines because the viral antigens on the surfaces of VLPs can induce humoral and cellular responses [24, 26, 27] . Two VLP-based vaccines have already been licensed for use in humans against hepatitis B virus and HPV, and more VLP-based vaccines are being evaluated in preclinical and clinical trials. In addition, chimeric VLPs have been generated by substituting part or all of the extracellular domain of a surface antigen of a VLP derived from one virus with one from another virus, and these VLPs have been shown to induce immune responses against the surface antigen from the other virus [35] . VLPs based on IBV structural proteins have been reported and employed for investigations of proteinprotein interactions and assembly of virons [2, 11, 17, 22, 31] . Influenza virus is a major threat to human health that causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide and is therefore always at the forefront of vaccine research. Influenza VLPs have been generated by co-infecting insect cells with recombinant baculoviruses expressing structural influenza proteins of matrix 1 (M1)/hemagglutinin (HA), HA/neuraminidase (NA)/M1, or HA/NA/M1/matrix 2 (M2). [14, 15, 21, 28, 33] . Influenza VLPs have been found to induce protective immunity in preclinical and clinical studies [20] . In light of the above findings, this study was conducted to investigate whether influenza VLPs could serve as a platform for the expression of IBV S1 protein, and whether VLPs containing S1 protein could serve as a candidate IBV vaccine.",

NA/S1 fusion gene was then generated by overlap PCR. The full-length of the fusion gene was 1674 bp, and it contained the CT and TM domains of NA (1\u223c120 bp) and the S1 sequence (121\u223c1,674 bp) [3] . The specific primers used to amplify the CT and TM domain were CCGGAATTCATGAATCCAAATCAGAA (forward primer 1) and GACCCATATTGAGATTAGTTTTGTATG (reverse primer 1). The primers used to generate S1 were CAATAT GGGTCATGTCGTACTACCATC (forward primer 2) and ACGCGTCGACACGTCTAAAACGACGTGTT (reverse primer 2). The above two PCR products were mixed equally to generate the fusion gene NA/S1 by PCR using forward primer 1 and reverse primer 2. The nucleotide sequences of the NA/S1 fusion and M1 genes were confirmed by DNA sequencing and then cloned into pFast-Bac-Dual vector (Invitrogen, USA) [26] . Recombinant bacmids r-Bacmid-NA/S1 and r-Bacmid-M1 were generated by transforming the recombinant pFast-Bac-Dual vector into Escherichia coli DH10-Bac competent cells. The purified recombinant bacmid DNA was then transfected into sf9 cells with cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen).

To optimize the production of chimeric VLPs, varied combinations of rBV-NA/S1 and rBV-M1 with different MOIs (1/1; 1/5; 1/10; 5/5; 5/1; 10/1) were used to co-infect cells, after which the yields of VLPs were determined. The results showed that the co-infection of both rBV-NA/S1 and rBV-M1 at an MOI of 5 generated the optimal yield (Fig. 2B) . The chimeric VLPs were purified by discontinuous sucrose density gradients, after which electron microscopy was used to examine the formation of chimeric VLPs.

In addition, since there were no available standard antigens, the quantification of S1-specific antibodies was difficult; accordingly, the OD was used for comparison. In both groups, each boost increased S1-specific antibody responses. Additionally, chimeric Fig. 7 . IBV-specific neutralization antibody titers in immunized SPF chickens.

The results showed that chimeric VLPs could be assembled by co-expressing fusion protein NA/S1 and influenza virus M1 protein. We also provided evidence demonstrating that chimeric VLPs were immunogenic and induced S1-specific antibody responses at a higher level than the inactivated H120 viruses. Furthermore, chimeric VLPs could induce significantly higher cellular immune-responses than the inactivated H120 viruses. IBV has an enormous economic impact on commercial poultry by causing highly contagious disease in chickens of all ages. Vaccination has been used to control IB for over half a century. Although inactivated and attenuated virus vaccines have contributed immensely to control of IB, they have some drawbacks. For example, attenuated virus vaccines pose a potential hazard of propagation of the virus via embryonated chicken eggs and therefore the risk of spreading the virus and generation of a stronger form. Despite this risk, inactivated virus vaccines are commonly used in combination with attenuated virus vaccines because they cannot induce a high level of S1-specific antibodies [10, 16, 21, 25] . Chimeric VLP is a promising development in the field of VLP research. For example, Newcastle disease VLPs contain respiratory syncytial virus proteins [26] , while membrane-anchored flagellin were incorporated into influenza VLPs [6] . In the present study, we demonstrated that fusion protein could successfully assemble and bud with influenza M1 to form chimeric VLPs, and that chimeric VLPs were similar to previously reported influenza VLPs. Accordingly, the results presented herein provide an additional example supporting the feasibility of generating chimeric VLPs [1] . This study demonstrated that the chimeric VLPs induced robust humoral responses with an obviously higher level than inactivated H120 viruses in both mice and chickens (p \uff1e 0.05). In addition, a higher level of IL-4 was detected in the VLPs group than in the inactivated H120 group (p \uff1c 0.05). Although the mechanism by which the chimeric VLPS elicited significantly higher IL-4 production than the inactivated H120 viruses is not clear. Furthermore, chimeric VLPs induced significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers than inactivated IBV viruses.",
