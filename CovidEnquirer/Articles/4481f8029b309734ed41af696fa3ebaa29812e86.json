            "text": "Screening for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) carriage in patients admitted to hospital features prominently in strategies for control of MRSA. 1, 2 The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America recently commissioned a critical review of the reasons for the failure to control the spread of MRSA in hospitals despite the existence of guidelines for over three decades. The review concluded that active surveillance cultures are essential to identify the reservoir for spread of MRSA infections, and make control possible using the Center for Disease Control's long-recommended contact precautions. 3 Similarly, Rubinovitch and Pittet found that the best way to detect occult MRSA reservoirs is by screening, 4 but this can be expensive. As a result, many hospitals either do not screen or only do limited screening. 5 This letter describes our evaluation and use of a recently described selective mannitol broth (SMB) for rapid ciprofloxacin-resistant MRSA screening. 6 Selective mannitol broth was prepared as described previously and poured in 5-mL aliquots. SMB was made by adding mannitol (5 g/L), trehalose (5 g/L), sodium chloride (25 g/L), aztreonam (20 mg/L), ciprofloxacin (8 mg/L), colistin sulphate (1 000 000 U/L) and 2% phenol red (350 mL) to 1 L of nutrient broth. 5 Growth of MRSA produces a colour change from red to yellow after overnight incubation at 37 8C in air.",

Furthermore, swirling the swabs in the broth for a few seconds was easier, quicker and gave comparable results to the current practice of breaking the swabs in broth. These features of SMB enabled us to introduce the use of SMB in the hospital. The nursing staff swirl screening swabs from various sites into a single SMB that is labelled with the patient's identification details. This precludes the need to label several swabs and saves time. The broths are incubated for 18-24 h in the laboratory and the results of negative tests are available within 24 h.

However, it is equally important to ensure that healthcare personnel are using these masks correctly. In November 2003, 12 members of staff on our respiratory ward were trained on the correct method for putting on respirator masks (Tecnol fluid N95 particulate filter, Kimberly Clark); they were asked to cascade this training on to remaining staff on the ward. In February 2004, with help from the suppliers, we returned to test the adequacy of mask fitting by staff. This involved staff putting on a mask using their normal method and then wearing a plastic hood into which a saccharin solution was aerosolized. They were then asked to read a paragraph of text and any tasting of saccharin during this time was regarded as a mask-fit failure, demonstrating to staff that this left them exposed to infectious agents. The results are shown in Table I . The majority of staff who had not been trained failed the test. Although there was a greater degree of success amongst those formally trained, they still failed to comply with the manufacturer's instructions in all aspects, which suggests that their future success may be haphazard.",
