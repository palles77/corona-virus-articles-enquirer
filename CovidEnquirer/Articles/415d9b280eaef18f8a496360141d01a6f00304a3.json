            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in southeast Asia in late 2002 and subsequently spread internationally. To date, it has resulted in more than 8000 cases and 774 deaths. 1 The causative agent was quickly identified as a previously unknown member of the Coronaviridae family. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] SARS infection of human beings has since been contained through infection-control measures. However, resurgence is still a threat because the causative agent remains in animal reservoirs that are not fully understood and sporadic cases continue to be reported. We have an incomplete understanding of the genesis of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and there may be the potential for the emergence of variants capable of greater transmissibility. Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a genome that is a single strand of positive sense RNA of 30 kilobases or more in length. Sequence analysis of the RNA genome of the SARS coronavirus identified 11 open reading frames encoding proteins typical of coronaviruses, including the envelope spike (S) protein of the virus particle. [5] [6] [7] SARS illness in humans is chiefly a pneumonia, notwithstanding the occurrence of systemic disease signs and detection of virus or viral RNA in other organs. 4, 9, 10 The primary mode of transmission of SARS seems to be through mucosal membranes of the eyes, nose, or mouth; 1,9 faecal-oral transmission has also been suggested but its occurrence and relative importance have not yet been documented. The prominent role of the respiratory tract in SARS transmission and disease suggest that direct immunisation of the respiratory mucosa would be an effective strategy for immunoprophylaxis against SARS. Furthermore, mucosal immunisation of the respiratory tract with live attenuated respiratory virus vaccines efficiently induces systemic as well as local immunity. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] As an approach for the development of a vaccine against SARS coronavirus, we took advantage of an existing live attenuated vaccine virus, BHPIV3, that is being developed for intranasal paediatric immunisation against HPIV3 infection and disease. 11,14 BHPIV3 was derived from bovine (B)PIV3, 14,16 a closely-related bovine counterpart of HPIV3 that is attenuated in primates because of a natural host range-restriction. It has also been shown to be attenuated and immunogenic in humans, and is a candidate vaccine against HPIV3. 14,16 BPIV3 was modified previously with recombinant DNA methods to replace its F and HN protective surface antigen genes with their HPIV3 counterparts, yielding BHPIV3. 11 BHPIV3 was an improved HPIV3 vaccine, since it bears protective antigens that exactly match HPIV3. 11 In our study, BHPIV3 was further modified by the insertion of a transcriptional cassette containing the coding sequence of the full-length S protein of SARS coronavirus. The S protein was chosen because studies with other coronaviruses showed that it is a major viral surface protein important in initiating infection. Virus growth and virological and serological assays BHPIV3/SARS-S and BHPIV3/Ctrl were propagated on LLC-MK2 monkey kidney cells, and viral titres were determined by limiting dilution on the same cells using haemadsorption with guinea pig erythrocytes (a property of the HPIV3 HN protein) to detect virus infection. 11, 12 Titres are expressed in units of tissue culture 50% infectious dose (TCID 50 ), which are similar in magnitude to a plaque forming unit.",

The cDNA was designed so that the SARS coding sequence was flanked by short HPIV3-specific transcription signals that are necessary for the foreign gene to be expressed by the transcriptional program of the BHPIV3 vector (sequences of the oligonucleotide primers and details of RT-PCR and DNA construction are available from A Bukreyev). 11, 12 A PCR product of the expected length was purified and inserted into a NotI restriction endonuclease site that had previously been introduced into a complete cloned cDNA of BHPIV3, 11 and the sequence of the insert and flanking regions was confirmed. In this configuration, the SARScoronavirus S insert is present as an added gene located between the BHPIV3 P and M genes (figure 1) and would be expressed as a separate mRNA by the BHPIV3 polymerase. Certain idiosyncratic features of HPIV3 molecular genetics were also accommodated: the insert was designed so that the BHPIV3 genome length remained an even multiple of six, which is required for efficient HPIV3 replication and is thought to reflect a nucleocapsid spacing requirement. 21 In addition, the insert was designed to maintain the spacing of the transcriptional units within this hexamer organisation. 21 The recombinant BHPIV3/SARS-S virus was recovered and propagated in cell culture as described elsewhere. 11, 12 We constructed and recovered the control virus using the same methods as those described for BHPIV3/SARS-S, except that the S open reading frame of the insert was replaced by a foreign sequence of identical length (derived from a complementary copy of the genome of human 0\u00b75 mL of inoculum with a sterile Luer syringe introduced about 3-5 mm into each nostril. For intratracheal inoculation, a sterile stainless steel laryngoscope was used to observe the epiglottis, and the 1 mL inoculum was delivered through a sterile flexible catheter that had been inserted about 3 cm past the epiglottal opening. We used separate sterilised instruments for every animal. Nasopharyngeal swabs were taken on days 0-10, 12, and 14, and tracheal lavages were done on days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 14, 22 and titration of BHPIV3/SARS-S and BHPIV3/Ctrl was done as described previously. For tracheal lavage, we used a laryngoscope and catheter placed as described above, with a 2 mL wash volume of phosphate-buffered saline that was instilled and aspirated back. For the SARS-coronavirus challenge, the animals were given a similar combined intranasal and intratracheal inoculation with 10 6 TCID 50 units of virus in a 1 mL inoculum at each site. Nasopharyngeal swabs and tracheal lavages were obtained on the same schedule as that used after the initial immunisation. These experiments were done in an approved animal biosafety level 3 facility. Virus titration was done as described earlier. We took serum samples 1 day before immunisation (day -1), 1 day before the challenge (day 27), and 28 days post challenge (day 56), which were analysed for virus-specific antibodies as described above.",

This difference in immunogenicity might reflect the natural restriction of HPIV3 to the respiratory tract, whereas SARS coronavirus disseminates systemically, at least in non-human primates. 8, 9 There was no evidence of immune-mediated enhancement of infection or disease, which occurs for one coronavirus, feline infectious peritonitis virus. 23 Thus, our results show that one mucosal immunisation with vectored SARS S protein was sufficient to protect against shedding after a large challenge dose of SARS coronavirus.",

            "text": "Some cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) infected with SARS coronavirus have been reported to develop clinical disease signs including a transient rash, respiratory distress, and lethargy. 24, 8 We have investigated three species of monkeys, namely cynomolgus, rhesus (M mulatta), and African green monkeys, for permissiveness for SARS-coronavirus replication and possible disease (unpublished data). Of the three, African green monkeys supported the highest levels of replication as measured by virus shedding and hence were used in this study. None of the 12 animals in any of the three species developed overt disease signs, and we did not note disease signs in this study. Mice, ferrets, and cats have been shown to support high levels of pulmonary SARS-coronavirus replication, and some of the infected ferrets became lethargic. 25, 20 We did not assess BHPIV3/SARS-S in mice because the HPIV3 vaccine vector is severely restricted for replication in this animal, and the cat and ferret models were only recently reported. Thus, although our study showed complete protection against shedding of challenge virus, we could not assess whether protection would be afforded predicted full length unmodified S protein is 138 kDa and has 23 potential glycosylation sites. [5] [6] [7] There was no evidence of proteolytic cleavage of the SARS S protein into two subunits, as occurs with some coronaviruses. Since the SARS-coronavirus S protein is a transmembrane virion component and BHPIV3 also is an enveloped virus, we wanted to determine whether the S protein was incorporated into BHPIV3 particles. Western blot analysis did not detect the S protein in purified, concentrated BHPIV3/SARS-S virus particles (figure 2A, lane 1) under conditions where direct Coomassie staining ( figure 2B, lane 2) showed that viral protein was present in quantities greater than that required for detection by western blot. The absence of significant incorporation of S protein into virions suggests that its expression would be unlikely to affect the tropism of the vector and is a safety factor. Table 1 shows the monkeys' responses to immunisation. Analysis of the nasal swab samples taken after immunisation showed that the peak titre (3\u00b79 vs 4\u00b73 log 10 TCID 50 /mL) and duration of shedding (5\u00b78 vs 7\u00b78 days) from the upper respiratory tract did not differ significantly between BHPIV3/SARS-S and BHPIV3/ Ctrl. Analysis of the tracheal lavage samples, a measure of shedding from the lower respiratory tract, showed that two of the four animals infected with BHPIV3/SARS-S did not have detectable virus shedding, whereas the other two showed some shedding at 2 days but this was less than for the BHPIV3/Ctrl-immunised animals (table 1) . Thus, expression of the SARS S protein had an attenuating effect on the replication of the vector, particularly in the lower respiratory tract. Nevertheless, BHPIV3/SARS-S and BHPIV3/Ctrl each induced a moderate titre of HPIV3-specific antibodies as measured by an HAI assay (table 1 ). In addition, BHPIV3/SARS-S induced a detectable level of serum antibodies that neutralised SARS-S coronavirus in vitro (mean reciprocal titre of 3\u00b79 log 2 ). Table 2 shows responses to challenges with SARS coronavirus. All four monkeys immunised with BHPIV3/Ctrl shed challenge SARS coronavirus from the upper and lower respiratory tract. By contrast, none of the animals immunised with BHPIV3/SARS-S shed SARS coronavirus on any day from either the upper or lower respiratory tract. SARS-coronavirus-neutralising serum antibody titres 28 days after the challenge are shown in table 2. The increase in titre in the BHPIV3/SARS-S group after the challenge could be the result of an immune response to the antigen present in the virus inoculum or to a low level of replication of SARS coronavirus.",

With respect to human viruses, experimental animals rarely provide faithful models of the infection and disease that is observed in humans, and disease signs often are minimal, altered, or absent. The measurement of infectious challenge virus in secretions or other samples from experimental animals is a general standard for measuring the efficacy of viral vaccines. The assessment of an experimental vaccine in a non-human primate is especially important in view of the phylogenetic and anatomical similarity to humans, and is an appropriate last step before clinical trials. Attenuated versions of HPIV3 are under active development as vaccines for intranasal immunisation of infants and young children, as are HPIV3-based vectored vaccines that also express protective antigens of respiratory pathogens such as measles virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and metapneumovirus. 12, 13, 15 HPIV3 efficiently infects the respiratory tract but does not spread far beyond it, which is an important safety factor. HPIV3-based vectors have proven effective in inducing local and systemic immunity against a number of foreign antigens. 12, 13, 15 Furthermore, safe intranasal administration of attenuated HPIV3 and related viruses has been shown possible. 16, 26, 27 An additional safety feature is that RNA recombination is almost nonexistent in nature for the family of viruses represented by HPIV3, whereas recombination is extremely frequent in coronaviruses, and the potential for recombination with circulating human coronavirus would be a concern for a live-attenuated SARS-coronavirus vaccine virus.",

However, any replicating viral vector bearing the protective antigens of a common human pathogen, such as adenovirus or HPIV3, is unlikely to replicate sufficiently well in adults to be immunogenic because of a prevalence of neutralising antibodies to such pathogens. 26, 27 Fortunately, parainfluenza viruses have been amenable to swapping of the surface proteins without loss of infectivity in vitro or in vivo. 28, 29 Therefore, it should be possible to replace the HPIV3 HN and F surface proteins with those of an antigenically-distinct parainfluenza virus for which the general population lacks immunity-in particular one of the many avian parainfluenza viruses such as an attenuated strain of Newcastle disease virus.

Her family was pleasant, unsophisticated, of modest means, grateful that neurofibromatosis had only required small excisions over the years. Unfortunately, this procedure revealed sarcoma in her thigh. Off to our library. Small chances for 5-year survival, assuming hip disarticulation, according to case series of the time. Attending physicians proposed amputation. Mother and patient balked. They seemed to have known neurofibromatosis might take her. They wanted my opinion. I almost suggested travel to the Bahamas and Brompton's cocktails. I stifled myself, promised discussion later, went to a trusted consultant. This oncologist sided with the others: \"try for the best chance.\" I closed ranks. I endorsed treatment-only to have a sudden, private, visceral sense of wrong. They accepted amputation. She died within a year, not well. I never asked how she wanted to die. Lesson learnt: Beware of assumptions about a patient's life and preferences; ask.",

            "text": "BHPIV3/SARS-S virus was recovered and propagated in cell culture in parallel with the control virus, BHPIV3/Ctrl. The presence of foreign inserts did not affect the efficiency of replication of the vector in vitro. The BHPIV3 genome is a single strand of negative sense RNA of 15\u00b75 kilobases that contains six non-overlapping genes (figure 1). The virally-encoded polymerase initiates at the left end of the genome and transcribes each gene in turn, including any inserted foreign gene, into a separate mRNA. The correct expression of the S sequence as a separate mRNA was confirmed by northern blot analysis of intracellular RNA isolated from LLC-MK2 cells infected with BHPIV3/SARS-S (data not shown).Expression of the SARS-coronavirus S protein was confirmed by western blot analysis of lysates of BHPIV3/SARS-S-infected cells with serum of mice that had been infected with SARS coronavirus20 (figure 2A, lane 3). This showed that the S protein migrated as two major, diffuse bands of about 170 and 200 kDa. The two forms of the S protein probably differ by the extent of glycosylation; based on the nucleotide sequence, Expression of SARS-coronavirus S protein by BHPIV3/SARS-S in cell culture and its absence in the BHPIV3 virus particle A: western blot analysis shows presence of the SARS-coronavirus S protein in lysates of cells infected with BHPIV3/SARS-S (lane 3) and its absence in lysates from cells infected with BHPIV3/Ctrl (lane 4). S protein was not detectable in purified, concentrated BHPIV3/SARS-S virus particles (lane 1) or in the negative control BHPIV3/Ctrl (lane 2). B: direct Coomassie staining of a gel loaded with replicate samples of purified, concentrated BHPIV3/Ctrl (lane 1) and BHPIV3/SARS-S (lane 2) shows viral protein was present in excess of what should be necessary for detection by western blot analysis.",

An implicit excuse is provided by the training role. Memories of three mistakes remain particularly vivid. Internship. A general medicine ward. A geriatric patient, almost recovered. Little work remained. However, custom mandated a lumbar puncture (LP) for any patient who had a positive blood test for syphilis without recorded treatment. Positive spinal fluid meant more penicillin. I had come to regard LPs as benign, bedside procedures: just check for bulging optic discs. I mastered a technique for one handed opening and closing of screw-top specimen tubes. I could do LPs on my own, with no senior resident or nurse. So, I was working alone in my patient's room at the end of the hallway. I manoeuvered a long needle into the vertebral interspace. I removed the stylet. Out flowed bright red blood. Undiluted. Freely flowing. I fought my panic, replaced the stylet, fought my panic, removed the needle, fought my panic, pressed the site. No call button in reach. Too embarrassing to yell. Much time passed. A nurse finally happened along. Lesson learnt: Beware of overconfidence and always arrange backup.",
