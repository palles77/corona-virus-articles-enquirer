Remdesivir inhibits viral replication through premature termination of RNA transcription. 29, 30 In vitro studies have demonstrated that remdesivir inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in non-human cells. 31 Because remdesivir use was not given as part of a randomized controlled trial, we are unable to assess its effectiveness or safety. Randomized controlled trials of remdesivir are underway. [32] [33] [34] Two hospitalized patients received corticosteroids. WHO interim guidance for clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection with suspected COVID-19 advises against use of corticosteroids unless indicated for another reason. 35 Several limitations should be considered when interpreting our findings. Our sample of patients is small. Information collected from patient interviews may have been subject to response bias. The threshold for admitting patients and for monitoring in the hospital was likely lower than for other respiratory infections because of uncertainty about the clinical course of COVID-19.

These patients experienced mild to moderately severe illness. Clinicians should anticipate that some patients may worsen in the second week of illness. Early and prolonged detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA suggest the window for diagnosis of COVID-19 is long. Although duration of infectiousness is unclear, our early data show viable virus can be cultured readily from upper respiratory tract specimens soon after illness onset. Further investigations are needed to understand clinical course, immunologic response, SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, virus culture, and transmission, to inform clinical management and public health strategies to prevent disease spread.",
