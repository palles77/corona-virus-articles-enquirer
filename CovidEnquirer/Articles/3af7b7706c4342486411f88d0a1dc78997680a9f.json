Serologic investigation would have been a reliable method to reach the same diagnosis, albeit with the limitations that the results would not be known for several weeks, and laboratory costs could be higher. A third option would involve laboratory testing of samples obtained from live animals, such as nasal swabs or transtracheal washes. Although this can achieve a rapid diagnosis and has the flexibility of being based on few or many samples, it is a riskier option because most respiratory viral infections are transient, and testing therefore requires collection of samples early in the course of disease. Practitioners may not examine the herd until this early stage of infection has passed, whereas in large or extensively managed groups it may not be known which animals have most recently developed disease.",

Ideally, tissues should be collected from multiple animals that are reliably representative of the disease problem in the herd, early in the disease course, and not treated. This is often impossible for small herds of valuable animals, for which necropsybased investigations must rely on the few animals that have died despite attempted therapy. In such cases, histopathologic examination often reveals lesions that suggest viral or bacterial pneumonia, yet the specific pathogen cannot be identified because it has been eliminated by the immune response or antimicrobial therapy. The lung is vast, and multiple (3) (4) (5) samples harvested from the various areas will increase the frequency of diagnosis. Foci of caseous necrosis are ideal for detection of Mycoplasma bovis, and granulomas are sites of M bovis infection, but abscesses are of no value in identifying the primary bacterial pathogen.",

These contrasted with the negative results of the immunohistochemistry and fluorescent antibody tests and the absence of histologically evident syncytia. Reasons for the discrepancy in this case are speculative. The animal may have been subacutely infected, with little viral antigen remaining in the lung.

Laboratory quality control and overfixation of tissues were not thought to contribute to the negative tests in this case, based on appropriate results in control samples.

Calves were treated with antibiotics, and 1 died. Pens of older (w1 year of age) calves elsewhere in the same barn had no clinical signs. This is an unusual clinical presentation, and a diagnosis was not immediately apparent. A field postmortem examination of the dead calf revealed fibrinous bronchopneumonia. Although laboratory testing of tissues from this animal might have been useful, it was uncertain whether the problem in the calves was the same as the more perplexing problem in the cows. Instead, the diagnostic investigation focused on the cows, in an effort to ensure that the results were applicable to the problem of most concern.",

None of the calves seroconverted to BPI3V, confirming the just-noted suspicion that the disease in the calves differed from that in the cows. 3. There was a consistent trend of higher titers in young calves and lower titers in older calves, for all viruses tested except BRSV.

One calf was obviously sick and later determined to have a fever. But another calf had been under observation by the producer since the previous day, with a subtle tendency to stay apart from its mates and away from the feed bunk.

            "text": "Clinical examination from a distance-the art of pen checking-is an efficient screening test for disease in all production systems from large pens of beef steers to small groups of pastured dairy heifers, and most animals that require therapy to prevent death or chronic disease are identified with this method. However, even well-trained and experienced producers, staff, or veterinarians are imperfect and uncertain when it comes to distinguishing calves with disease from those experiencing distress as a result of recent weaning, transportation, processing, and disruption of social groups. Further distinction between respiratory disease and diseases of other body systems and between antibiotic-responsive pneumonia and nonbacterial causes of respiratory disease are even more imprecise based on clinical features alone. In a study to assess diagnosis of BRD by feedlot personnel, the sensitivity of BRD diagnosis by pen checkers was 94% and specificity was 77%. 34 Similarly, there was poor correlation between pulling a calf for suspected BRD and the presence of lung lesions at slaughter. 35 Further, these challenges only cover the need to identify those calves with severe bacterial pneumonia that without treatment would die or Box 5 Laboratory tests to detect subclinical disease and to refine the clinical diagnosis Total white blood cell count and differential cell count are poor predictors of respiratory disease in feedlot cattle and do not significantly differentiate clinically sick from clinically normal animals in the first week after arrival. Similarly, these parameters, when measured in acutely sick calves, were not useful predictors of the severity of lung lesions at necropsy. 42, 43 Arterial blood gas analysis and blood lactate levels do not reliably predict disease in challenged calves with mild lung lesions. 42 However, in cattle with severe respiratory disease, a plasma lactate concentration of 4 mmol/L predicted death within 24 hours. 44 Serum haptoglobin concentrations in serum or plasma increase following experimental Mannheimia haemolytica challenge of BHV-1-infected calves, and the degree of haptoglobin elevation correlated with disease severity, treatment failure, and greater likelihood of death. [45] [46] [47] Compared with the rapid (24 hours) increase in serum haptoglobin within 24 hours of the induction of pneumonic pasteurellosis, the response to BRSV or BVDV infection is more delayed, occurring during a period of 4-8 days and corresponding with the onset of a febrile response to the viral infection. 45, [48] [49] [50] The findings of these experimental studies extend to the naturally occurring disease, in which increased serum haptoglobin level has been correlated with the presence of fever and clinical diagnosis of BRD. 46, 47, 51, 52 Tests to measure other APPs, including lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and serum amyloid A, are not routinely available but may have advantages of earlier peak concentration. 50, 53 In other studies, measuring fibrinogen, serum amyloid A, or a 1 -acid glycoprotein, have not effectively distinguished between healthy cattle and those with respiratory disease under field conditions. 46, 47, 51, 52 Animals need to be sampled early in the course of disease, at the onset of clinical signs, for haptoglobin and other APPs to have good diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. The sensitivity and specificity of detecting BRD are further improved by testing multiple APPs in parallel instead of using a single protein. 47 A peril in using APPs to detect BRD is that an increase in APPs reflects inflammation that is not specific to the respiratory system. Haptoglobin values were elevated to a similar degree as with BRD-affected calves when measured in dairy calves affected by diarrhea, umbilical infections, and oral abscesses. 51 Thus, a clinical assessment of the animal assists in the interpretation of elevated APP concentrations.",
