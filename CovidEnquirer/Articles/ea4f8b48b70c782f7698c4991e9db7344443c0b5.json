            "text": "Recently, an outbreak of fatal infection caused by a pantropic variant (strain CB/05) of canine coronavirus (CCoV) has been reported. In this study, evidence is provided that immunity induced by natural exposure to enteric CCoV is not fully protective against strain CB/05. Twenty-two, 10-week-old beagles with a recent natural infection by enteric CCoV were randomly distributed in two experimental groups of eight (groups A and B) and one control group of six (group C) dogs. Dogs in groups A and B were inoculated oronasally with different doses (4 \u00d7 10 5 or 4 \u00d7 10 3 TCID 50 ) of the pantropic strain CB/05, whereas dogs in group C were used as negative controls. Clinical, post-mortem and virological investigations showed that, despite the high serum antibody titres induced by the prior natural infection with enteric CCoV, dogs were susceptible to experimental infection with strain CB/05. This was shown by the occurrence of faecal shedding, and dogs displaying moderate clinical signs, mainly vomiting and diarrhoea. Involvement of the lymphoid tissues was evident as demonstrated by the acute lymphopenia (below 70% of the initial counts), gross lesions in spleen and lymph nodes and detection of CB/05 RNA in thymus, spleen and lymph nodes of some infected dogs. The presence of viral RNA in lymphoid tissues was observed only in dogs euthanised in the early stages of infection and the clinical course of the infection was unrelated to the viral dose administered. The present study demonstrates that strain CB/05 is able to induce infection and disease in dogs seropositive to enteric CCoV, thus highlighting the need for extensive epidemiological investigation and for the possible development of novel antigenically relevant vaccines.",

            "text": "CCoV is generally recognised as an aetiological agent of selflimiting infections of the intestinal epithelium, which can lead to the onset of clinical signs typical of the gastroenteric involvement, such as inappetance, diarrhoea and vomiting [6, 7] . Recently, a highly virulent variant of CCoV type II (strain CB/05) was reported that caused a systemic disease, followed by fatalities in pups [8] . The virus was isolated from the internal organs (lungs, spleen, liver and kidney), that had severe gross lesions. CCoV type II RNA was also detected in the brain, thus accounting for the neurological signs observed in the affected pups. Sequence analysis of the 3 genome end of the pantropic CCoV strain, including ORFs 2 (S gene), 3a, 3b, 3c, 4 (E gene), 5 (M gene), 6 (N gene), 7a and 7b, showed that strain CB/05 has a high degree of aa identity to the cognate ORFs of CCoV type II, although the S protein displayed the highest identity to FCoV type II strain 79-1683. A genetic marker was identified in the CB/05 genome, consisting of a 38-nt deletion in ORF3b which is responsible for a predicted truncated nonstructural protein 3b [9] . Experimental infection of seronegative pups with strain CB/05 reproduced the disease with occurrence of severe clinical signs, including pyrexia, anorexia, depression, vomiting, diarrhoea and leukopenia [10] . A different clinical course was observed according to the age of the infected pups. The older dogs (6 months of age) slowly recovered from the disease, whereas two of three 2.5-month-old dogs were sacrificed due to the severity of the CB/05-induced disease [10] .",

Although the dogs used in this study had a strong humoral immunity to enteric CCoV at the time of challenge, the experimental infection with strain CB/05 was successful in all pups irrespective of the viral dose administered. It is noteworthy that exposure to even low amounts of virus would have similar infectivity on seropositive animals, since dogs inoculated with different viral loads (4 \u00d7 10 5 or 4 \u00d7 10 3 TCID 50 /ml of viral suspension) displayed the same duration of viral shedding and there was little difference in the viral titres in the faeces.",

This was attributed mainly to the crossprotection induced by antibodies against enteric CCoV. However, the lymphotropism of the strain CB/05 was clearly demonstrated by the occurrence of lymphopenia (albeit moderate) in several infected pups of groups A and B. We hypothesise that the high antibody titres to enteric CCoV could have induced only partial protection against strain CB/05, which infected the dogs, causing enteritis and lymphopenia, but which failed to spread systemically, with the exception of lymphoid tissues where traces of the viral RNA were detected after necropsy. However, despite the occurrence of moderate lymphopenia and the presence of the virus in lymphoid tissues, the viral RNA was not detected in the blood at any time. This finding may be due to very low levels of viremia that were not detected by the molecular assays used. A similar pattern has been described for feline infectious peritonitis virus, that may be undetected in the blood especially during periods of apparent recovery after acute infection [16] .",

Only an experimental modified-live virus vaccine administered oronasally has been able to induce complete protection from disease as well as from infection. Considering that the immunity induced by natural infection with enteric CCoV is not able to protect pups from challenge with strain CB/05, the efficacy of currently used vaccines prepared with enteric CCoV strains may be poorer against pantropic CB/05-like viruses. According to this scenario, dogs vaccinated with enteric CCoV may acquire subclinical infections with CB/05-like strains resulting in lymphopenia which may represent a predisposing factor for opportunistic pathogens and for a more severe disease induced by \"true\" pathogens (canine parvovirus, canine distemper virus, etc.).",
