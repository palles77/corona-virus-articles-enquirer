To take this into consideration, we represent cilia in multiple patches, instead of the conventional 'dense mat' representation. We focus on the combined action and interplay of these patches. The effects of varying the frequency, spacing and phase lag of the beating of one cilia bunch with respect to the beating of adjacent patches are studied. We model the Airway Surface Liquid (ASL) as a three-layer structure. The possibility of an optimum frequency of beating is noted and the change of mucous flow under different spacing and phase differences are observed.",

            "text": "The study of cilia has shown escalating physiological significance in the past decade owing to the discovery of its role in the proper functioning of many mechanisms in the human body and other organisms. In a relatively short period of time, over ten diseases, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), hydrocephalus, polycystic liver and kidney disease, some forms of retinal degeneration and Joubert Syndrome, have been linked to the malfunctioning of cilia. They have been classified as 'ciliopathies' (Badano [1] ), (Adams et al. [2] ). Some of the most vital ciliopathies are caused due to the lack of coordination in ciliary movement in the epithelium. Cilia exhibit a distinctive, complex asymmetric manner of movement. Each beat cycle comprises of an 'effective stroke' and a 'recovery stroke'. In the former, the cilia are relatively straight, and their effect on the fluid is maximized. In the latter, their effect on the surrounding medium is minimized since the cilium has a more curved shape. Any disruption of this characteristic pattern can lead to physiological problems such as when the cilia on the epithelium show hyper/hypo motility or disoriented arrangement and beat direction (Van's Gravesande et al. [3] ). The PCD is a classic example of such a condition. It involves the cilia on the respiratory tract and reproductive organs. PCD leads to poor muco-ciliary clearance and hence infection (Rayner et al. [4] ), (Bush et al. [5] ). This disease manifests itself during the embryologic phase of development and is a result of inefficient and unsynchronized ciliary movement.",

It considers a three-layered structure of the Airway Surface Liquid (ASL), including a bottom-most layer of Newtonian Periciliary fluid (PCL), an overlying traction layer and a top-most thick layer of mucous (Fig. 1) . The traction layer is essentially an extension of the linearly viscoelastic mucous layer, which defines the maximum extent to which the cilia-tips extend and hence the traction layer can be assumed to be responsible for transmission of cilia-tip forces to the mucous layer. The cilia length is considered to be around 6 \u03bcm, and most of this length is submerged in the PCL except during the momentary extension into the traction layer during the effective stroke. Thus, the PCL is taken to be 5.4 \u03bcm, and the traction layer about 0.6 \u03bcm. The overlying mucous layer is taken as 4 \u03bcm. The width of the domain was taken to be considerably larger than the height, in order to compensate for edge effects. A two dimensional model is created, with the effect of the cilia represented as propulsive body forces in the traction layer and resistive viscous forces in the PCL. A simple Maxwell model of viscoelasticity is used and is established in the traction and mucous layers.",

Then during the recovery stroke, a period of sufficient length must again be granted for the cilium to release itself from the contact of the mucous (Silberberg [31] ). This is because of the elasticity of the mucous. Thus, unlike most fluids which are characterized only by their viscosities, mucous exhibits complex visco-elastic behavior. It can be argued that non-Newtonian fluids can be exploited by biological systems to their advantage because viscoelastic stresses allow a tuning of kinematics of transport and locomotion in a manner that is not possible from Newtonian fluids (Lauga [32] ). In the same reference, it is observed that the energetics of a fluid which has some elasticity is more favorable in many biological systems such as that of swimming spermatozoa. The first plot (a) represents the horizontal cilium velocity whereas (b) represents the vertical cilium velocity. The solid line curve shows the curve as obtained from the reference paper [28] whereas the dashed line curve is the plot generated by MATLAB and represents the input to our model. Hence there is need for the mucous to be modeled with an elastic component, in addition to the fluid viscosity, which would allow it to deform and then recoil in response to penetration. A simple model for this purpose is the Maxwell Model. The Maxwell model is defined by the parameters of 'single relaxation time', \u03bb and 'steady flow viscosity', \u03bc.",

The second is a viscous component that grows with time as long as the stress is applied. The Maxwell model predicts that stress decays exponentially with time.

The epithelial layer spans a very large area within the body, lining various organs, and so mucous flow occurs over relatively large distances. However, our domain represents only a small part of the epithelium. Hence, is imperative to allow for free flow of fluid to and from regions adjacent to our domain. We thus use the open boundary condition at the sides of the domain. The bottom boundary was defined as a wall. It represents the fact that there is no flow through the epithelium and the no-slip condition at the epithelium-PCL interface. Also, due to the wall boundary condition, it is possible to impose the zero vertical velocity boundary condition at the epithelium-PCL interface. The top most boundary is a stress boundary. The stress boundary represents the interface between the mucus and the air and allows us to model the shearing effects of the air flow upon the mucus. In our model, however, we have used zero shear stresses in order to simplify the situation. All the interior boundaries had zero vertical velocity applied on them.

The boundaries separating these units are continuity boundaries and thus allow flow from one unit to the other (Fig. 5) . We observe movement of the mucous to the positive direction in each of the domains (Fig. 5) . In all our simulations, we have five such units. The first, third and fifth are unciliated, whereas the second and fourth are ciliated. The black line separating the adjacent units can be seen in the Fig. 5(b) .Thus the second and fourth units of the model are the first and second ciliated domains respectively. Also, the third unit of the model is the second un-ciliated domain. In our studies, we focus on the first and second ciliated domains and the second un-ciliated domains (as this is the domain separating the two ciliated regions).When we vary the spacing between the two ciliated domains; we alter the length of the second un-ciliated domain. The study of the phase difference is conducted by altering the phase difference between the ciliary beat cycles in the first and second ciliated domains. Also, it is to be noted that it is the mucous layer in each unit is that of interest since we aim to study the factors altering mucous movement in order to gain deeper insight into the pathological conditions that may occur in the ciliary epithelium. We therefore study the movement of the mucous as a result of the ciliary motion in the PCL layer.",

The simulations that represent the cilia to occur in patches are physiologically more accurate than those that represent the ciliary epithelium to be an infinite array of cilia, beating in synchrony. It was interesting to compare the average mucus velocity obtained from our 'validation model' (where cilia are modeled as a 'dense mat', as per the mathematical model by Smith et al.) , and our new model with cilia represented in 'patches'. We plotted the average mucous velocity, averaged over time, at different values of frequency (from 10 rad/s to 100 rad/s) for the validation model. We also plotted the average mucus velocity (averaged over both ciliated and un-ciliated patches) in our simulations with cilia in patches, averaged over time. In these simulations, both the patches were kept at the same frequency (which was varied from 10 rad/s to 100 rad/s). The obtained plots are shown in Fig. 14 . We took separate sets of readings for when the patches were in 01 phase difference (represented by the blue line on Fig. 14) , 601 phase difference (green line on Fig. 14) , and 120 degree phase difference (black line on Fig. 14) from each-other, respectively. The set of readings obtained from the validation model (dense mat representation of cilia) is shown by the red line. It can be seen that the values for all the plots are of the same order of magnitude and that the values obtained for our patched model do not vary appreciably from that of the validated 'dense mat' (or single domain) model. However, the values in the 'dense mat' model are about three times higher than that of the patched model. This difference, however, can be attributed to the obvious fact that in the patched domain, there are less cilia per unit length to propel the mucus. In fact, the reduction in mucous movement is proportional to reduction in ciliated space. Over a considerable large surface area however, such as the entire area of epithelial surface lining the respiratory system of an organism, this effect will not be prominent.",

Due to this fact, the patched model also allows us to dig deeper in to the mechanism of mucus clearance.

Do all the patches beat in the same direction at all times? What happens if some of the patches stop beating due to disease or even during normal conditions? In those situations, do the remaining patches change their mode of beating in order to keep the mucous flow rate undisturbed? Through our simulations, we try to find the answers to some of these questions.",

Since by increasing the dimensions of a ciliated domain we are increasing the region of activity of the cilia, this is quite understandable. However, after increasing the length of the ciliated domain, the effect of putting the bunches out of phase seems to be largely subverted. This is evident from the fact that in Fig. 11 , we see that the value of mucous flux in the first ciliated domain (whose length has been increased) is almost identical to that seen in Fig. 10 , whereas the mucous flux in the second ciliated domain seen in figure is much less in Fig. 11 compared to Fig. 10 .

            "text": "It is slightly more difficult to predict the effect of increasing the gap between the cilia patches. In our simulation, this was done by increasing the length of the unciliated region in between the two ciliated domains. In Ref. [30] it is mentioned that the region of ciliary activity is divided into distinct patches and the influence of each such patch extends only the short distance across the area and fades at the edges of the region. Owing to the increased distance between the ciliated regions therefore, we would expect the mucous flow within the ciliated regions to not alter significantly and that the flow in the intermediate unciliated region would reduce, since the effect of the ciliated bunches would not be as pronounced in this larger bulk of mucous. It is seen, however, that despite the increased distance between the bunches, the mucous flow in the unciliated region is not reduced. When the cilia bunches on either side of this unciliated domain are in synchrony, for example, the flux in this unciliated region is larger than that of the other unciliated regions. This indicates that even if sections of ciliary epithelium are impaired due to disease, the muco-ciliary clearance rates can remain conserved provided surrounding patches are functioning. Of course, this argument fails in case of large scale damage of ciliary epithelium. Though the mucous flow in this unciliated region is much greater than that of the other unciliated regions, the increase is not linear with increase in length, as was observed when the length of the ciliated domain was increased. More interestingly, however, when the ciliated patches are completely out of phase, the mucous flux in the intermediate unciliated region greatly reduces and becomes almost equal to that of the other regions without cilia. This is interesting because in the cases where all the domains were of equal length and also in the other case where the length of the first ciliated domain was increased, the flow in the intermediate unciliated region was not affected much when the bunches were put out of synchronization. It seems therefore, that when the ciliated regions are farther away from each-other, the effect of putting them out of synchronization becomes more pronounced.",

            "text": "Frequency is another important factor that alters mucous flux. It is known that the frequency of ciliary beating can be altered due to the influence of chemicals such as Ach. (Kawakami et al. [37] ). In a study to investigate the effects of pharmaceutical agents on the ciliary beat frequency (on rabbit tracheal epithelium), it was found that benzalkonium chloride induced inhibition of CBF in a concentration dependent manner (Wang et al. [38] ). On the other hand, potassium sorbate resulted in an increase in CBF (Wang et al. [38] ). Also it has been found that the hormone Progesterone has the effect of reducing ciliary beat frequency in experimental studies on mouse fallopian tube (Bylander et al. [39] ). Thus, it is clear that the ciliary beat frequency can be modulated by extraneous agents, which in turn alters the flow of mucus. This can have therapeutic application in treating various muco-ciliary disorders. Recognizing this fact, we made a detailed study of how modulation of CBF of patches of cilia affects mucus flow. While testing the effects of frequency, we also put the two cilia bunches at different phase differences from each-other, in order to provide a greater range of trial conditions. For each value of phase lag applied, we put both the bunches at the same frequency. We applied frequencies between 10 rad/s and150 rad/s, with increments of10 rad/s. Interestingly, for all the plots we obtained, the peak value of mucous flux was seen at the frequency value of 10 rad/s (1.6 Hz). It is not easy to provide an explanation for this observation. However, the fact that we have obtained a probable optimum frequency is interesting. It is highly probable that the value of optimum frequency we have obtained is highly specific to our simulation, with the given arrangement and shape of cilia bunches. Nevertheless, it does make us aware that there is a possibility of something such as an optimum frequency of ciliary beating. This is an interesting aspect deserving greater attention in the future.

For example, the bunches of cilia depicted in our model have regular geometry. In reality, the patches of cilia are of irregular shape. Also, in reality there is a spatial distribution of the patches. Thus, interaction of the ciliary bunches does not take place only along one dimension, and the analysis is more complex.
