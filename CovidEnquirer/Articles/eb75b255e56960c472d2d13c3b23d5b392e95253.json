Amongst others, these include fast indexing of spatial data in distributed networks. In this paper we propose a novel semantic overlay network for large-scale multi-dimensional spatial information indexing, called SON_LSII, which has a hybrid structure integrating a semantic quad-tree and Chord ring. The SON_LSII is a small world overlay network that achieves a very competitive trade-off between indexing efficiency and maintenance overhead. To create SON_LSII, we use an effective semantic clustering strategy that considers two aspects, i.e., the semantic of spatial information that peer holds in overlay network and physical network performances. Based on SON_LSII, a mapping method is used to reduce the multi-dimensional features into a single dimension and an efficient indexing algorithm is presented to support complex range queries of the spatial information with a massive number of concurrent users. The results from extensive experiments demonstrate that SON_LSII is superior to existing overlay networks in various respects, including scalability, maintenance, rate of indexing hits, indexing logical hops, and adaptability. Thus, the proposed SON_LSII can be used for large-scale spatial information indexing.",

With the increase in demand for online services of spatial information, the challenges of fast indexing in distributed networks has become a hot research topic in the combined field of Computer Science and Geographic Information Science. The indexing information involves multi-dimensional data, the corresponding online services of which are becoming increasingly more complicated, especially in that they require complex spatial extent data (e.g. BBox, Bounding Box) with a massive number of concurrent users through network browser. For example, there exist a massive number of concurrent queries for spatial extent data about the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in the spring of 2003. The GIS (Geographic Information Systems) based on browser/server (Gogu et al., 2006) cannot efficiently support these large-scale spatial information queries and indexing since the central GIS server unavoidably suffers with hotspot bottleneck and single point of failure (Wu et al., 2010) . Here term large-scale means the number of concurrent users is very large, maybe up to thousands or even millions. There exists a contradiction between hotspot bottleneck of GIS server and a massive number of concurrent users for spatial information queries. This scientific problem has not yet been solved completely. Therefore, various new methods have been investigated to address this problem.",

( , 2007 presented their preliminary work, DQTChord, which is the work most closely related to our study. In this paper, we compare our approach with DQTChord, in which the spatial data is first divided based on Distributed Quad-Tree, and then mapped onto a Chord. Our approach differs from theirs in that we use a hybrid structure for the overlay network, which includes two layers and considers semantic information. Peers with similar semantics in our semantic overlay network are organized into same peer clusters, which make sharing information among peers more efficiently. The benefits of our approach include a decreased indexing load and increased indexing efficiency. Other related works include (Hu et al., 2008) , which uses the P2P framework FLoD to 3D scene streaming for virtual globe applications, and Kantere et al., 2009 , which use SPATIALP2P, a totally decentralized framework for spatial data built on top of a one-dimensional DHT. In (Zhang et al., 2009) a swift tree structure for multidimensional data indexing is proposed, which has a query efficiency of O(logN) in terms of routing hops and an low maintenance cost. Our spatial information indexing is substantially different. It is based on a semantic overlay network with a multi-layer structure.",

This network is connected by logical links between peers in a semantic quad-tree topology, which is a small world network with a small average path length and a large clustering coefficient. In our semantic quad-tree, peers with similar semantics are organized into same peer clusters, which can be further adaptively arranged into a small world network. According to this semantic proximity, we can dynamically construct the topology of an overlay network in a robust, dependable manner based on our previous work, i.e., HPSIN and SDI-CDQT (Wu et al., 2010; Zou et al., 2011) . In (Wu et al., 2010) a HPSIN was proposed by us, which combines distributed quad-tree with distributed hash table (DHT) to maintain both query efficiency and system load balance. Based on our HPSIN, we further propose a SDI-CDQT extending the quad-tree layer in HPSIN by semantic clustering strategy (Zou et al., 2011) , which makes the peers with similar interesting belong to the same cluster. However, there exist insufficiencies under a massive number of concurrent users indexing since both HPSIN and SDI-CDQT did not effectively consider the construction of overlay network for large-scale spatial information indexing. To our best knowledge, there lacks effective fast construction protocol of overlay network and the corresponding theoretical analysis for spatial information indexing.",

Furthermore, the theoretical analysis of the convergence speed of SON_LSII is formally presented from four cases. The SON_LSII supports a massive number of concurrent users indexing and is a small world overlay network that achieves a very competitive tradeoff between indexing efficiency and maintenance overhead. 3) We propose efficient algorithms to support large-scale range queries of the spatial information in a parallel manner based on SON_LSII framework. 4) Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of SON_LSII with regard to various aspects, including scalability, rate of indexing hits, indexing logical hops, adaptability, and so on.",

            "text": "Before describing SON_LSII model in detail, we present an overview of our system. While there exist some different points from HPSIN as described in Section 1.3, the system structure of SON_LSII is similar to HPSIN (Wu et al., 2010) , which is a hybrid structure including Chord Ring Layer and Semantic Quad-tree Layer as depicted in Fig. 1 . Differing from the DQTChord (Distributed Quad-Tree Chord) structure (Tanin et al., 2007) , our hybrid structure stores subspace data directly in a semantic quad-tree rather than a Chord ring to reduce the communication cost and enhance indexing efficiency. Fig. 1 depicts the hybrid structure of SON_LSII, which is organized in layered clustering method. First, we place the head peer of the semantic cluster into the Chord ring layer according to the semantics of spatial information that peer holds. And then, in semantic quad-tree, we let each head peer maintain a cluster of four neighboring peers based on a uniform k-element Semantic Vector (SV) where k is some constant. The two main aspects of the semantic space correspond to two sub-SVs, SV 1 and SV 2 . SV\u00bc{SV 1 , SV 2 }\u00bc e 11 ; e 12 ; \u2026; e 1k 1 \u00c8 \u00c9 ; e 21 ; e 22 ; \u2026; e 2k 2 \u00c8 \u00c9 \u00c8 \u00c9 , k 1 +k 2 \u00bc k. Note that Semantic Vector corresponds to a point in the semantic space while the word \"semantic\" here means that the element in SV and the point in the semantic space both contain some concrete feature or attribute, which is represented by one element e ij in the SV with the data object including a weight ij . SV 1 and SV 2 correspond to two aspects, respectively, i.e., the semantic of spatial information that peer holds in overlay network and physical network performances, such as online time and bandwidth. For an example, if there are three peers A,B,C, peer A requests some spatial information that hold by peer B and C, and peer B and C have the same online time, peer A perhaps share data with peer B or peer C. However, if peer B have shorter online time than peer C, peer A would only create one P2P logical link with peer C and share data with peer C. One peer in a semantic overlay network can be regarded as a point in the k-dimensional semantic space. Furthermore, the proximity of two peers can be represented by the Euclidean distance between the two points in the semantic space.",

For any spatial extent, we can get one unique control point from the center of its BBox. Whether a spatial object is a polygon or a polyline, there exists a minimal BBox for this spatial object. Fig. 2 illustrates an example of two spatial objects and the corresponding BBox and CP. The spatial object in BBox A comprises one CP O 1 at level 1 and four recursive space subdivisions A 1 , A 2 , A 3 , A 4 , respectively. The spatial object in BBox B is divided two levels: the CP O 1 corresponds to level 1 and the CPs O 11 , O 12 , O 13 and O 14 correspond to level 2.",

This routing protocol exhibits promising load-balancing behavior while without taking advantage of the homogeneity between data objects.

Now we focus on this impact under different conditions of simple peak propagation with different values of Num_Cache. First, we set Num_Cache\u00bc1 and observed the convergence. As shown in Table 1 , we found that the overlay network is not a connected graph with high probability. Next, we set Num_Cache\u00bc 2. And then we found that the overlay network is a connected graph with high probability, while the convergence speed is slower. Finally, we set 2o Num_CacheoN, for example, 10, 20, 40 or 80, and observed the cycle of convergence (Num_Cycle) for different network sizes. The results in Table 2 show that Num_Cache has no significant impact on the convergence speed, which are consistent with the analysis of Case B in Section 3.3.",
