            "text": "West Nile virus (WNV) is a member of the Flavivirus family and induces febrile illness, sporadic encephalitis, and paralysis. The capsid (Cp) of WNV is thought to play a role in inducing these symptoms through caspase-3-and caspase-9-dependent apoptosis. Using WNVCp as bait for a yeast two-hybrid assay, we identified that Hsp70 interacted with WNVCp. The interaction between Hsp70 and WNVCp was further substantiated using purified proteins. Deletion analysis of Hsp70 indicated that WNVCp could bind to the substrate binding domain of Hsp70. The presence of WNVCp in the Hsp70-dependent folding system inhibited the refolding of b-galactosidase (b-gal), which showed that WNVCp might function as a negative regulator of Hsp70. Finally, the cytotoxic effect of WNVCp in 293T cells was prevented by ectopic Hsp70, suggesting a negative regulatory role of Hsp70 on WNVCp. Our findings suggest a possible negative regulatory role of Hps70 in the pathway of WNV infection.",

Transient interactions between Hsp70 and unfolded polypeptides maintain its substrates in soluble, intermediate folded states and prevent protein misfolding and aggregation. Moreover, the intermediate substrates are subsequently folded into their native forms by the machinery of the Hsp70 chaperone [2] [3] [4] . This is accomplished, in part, by the help of a subclass of proteins known as cochaperones, which modulate the chaperone function of Hsp70 and its association with other partner proteins.",

On the other hand, Escherichia coli DnaK, a homologue of Hsp70, requires the nucleotide exchange factor, GrpE, for full-folding activity; DnaJ, a Hsp40 orthologue, is also required [8, 14] . These are essential partner proteins of Hsp70 that enhance Hsp70-dependent folding. The tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains of Hop (p60) link the multi-complex chaperone structures of Hsp70 and Hsp90; this linking helps to maintain the proper conformations of progesterone or estrogen aporeceptors prior to hormone binding [7, 11, 15] . Bag1 and Scythe are negative regulators of Hsp70-dependent folding processes [9, 10, 13] . They were initially found to interact with the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2, and the apoptotic mediator, Reaper, respectively [16] . Bag1 and Scythe share common structural features, namely the carboxyl-terminal Bag-domain that interacts with Hsp70 and the amino-terminal ubiquitin-like motif, the function of which is not well characterized [17] .",

Furthermore, when its gene is delivered to mouse brain or skeletal muscle, it can cause cell death and inflammation in vivo (24) . To further identify the functional role of WNVCp, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid assay using the entire region of WNVCp as bait. The result showed that several chaperones, including Hsp70, were able to bind to WNVCp. To confirm the binding ability of Hsp70 to WNVCp, recombinant Hsp70 and His-WNVCp were purified (Fig. 1A) . The interaction between purified recombinant proteins was tested using a Ni + -agarose pull-down assay (Fig. 1B) . The results indicated that Hsp70 was able to bind to WNVCp (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2) . ATP was added to the reaction system to exclude the possibility of denatured WNVCp binding to Hsp70 as an unfolded substrate (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4) . As a control, recombinant Hsp70 was shown not to bind to Ni + -agarose non-specifically (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6) . It is known that the presence of ATP facilitates the release of unfolded substrate from Hsp70 [1] . As a control, we carried out an interaction between Hsp70 and chemically denatured luciferase in the presence or absence of ATP (Fig. 1C) . The data indicated that, in the presence of ATP, the denatured substrates did not bind to Hsp70 (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 4) . The immunoprecipitation assays of ectopic WNVCp overexpressed in a human kidney tumor cell line, 293T, with endogenous Hsp70 showed that the WNVCp and Hsp70 bind in cells, indicating physiologically viable interaction between the two proteins (Fig. 1C) . Overall, the interaction between Hsp70 and WNVCp was not affected, which suggests that WNVCp could bind to Hsp70 as a binding partner rather than binding to unfolded substrates. Furthermore, Hsp70 could directly bind to WNVCp independently of ATP.",

The EEVD motif is considered to be important for its role in linking the SBD and ATPase domain of Hsp70, which enables the crosstalk between the two domains [2] . Furthermore, this motif is considered important for the refolding activities of Hsp70, since the lack of this motif terminates the refolding activities of Hsp70 [2] . To identify the role of EEVD motif in the interaction between Hsp70 and WNVCp, we employed the HSP70AAAA mutant. In this mutant, the four amino acids, EEVD, of the C-terminus are changed to AAAA [2] . When this mutant was purified as a recombinant protein, it was easily degraded to the ATPase domain and SBD [2] . Thus, the purified proteins displayed both full-length Hsp70AAAA and ATPase domain (Fig. 3B) . The data showed that this mutant was not able to bind to WNVCp, which suggested that the C-terminus might function as a motif for the interaction with WNVCp (Fig. 3B) .",

These results indicate that WNVCp could interact with Hsp70 in the cells. 1 and 3) , and protein complexes were precipitated (P: lanes 2 and 4) by Ni 2+ -agarose. Precipitated proteins were analyzed as described in Fig. 1B. Furthermore, the interaction seems to affect the cellular localization of WNVCp from the nucleoli to the cytoplasm. It is not certain, however, whether Hsp70 participates in the nuclear export of WNVCp or inhibits its localization of WNVCp into the nucleoli. Taken together, WNVCp was able to bind to the substrate domain of Hsp70 and inhibited its folding activities. Conversely, Hsp70 seems to be able to induce the cytoplasmic localization of WNVCp through direct interaction.",

            "text": "Hsp70 has a protective role against the cytotoxic effect of WNVCp Various viral proteins have been known to localize to the nucleoli, which could strategically aid in the propagation of many viruses. These proteins usually participate in the disruption of cytokinesis of mammalian cells, as seen in the N protein of the coronavirus and the capsid of human hepatitis B virus [27, 28] . It is also likely that the WNVCp might have disruptive activities against mammalian cells by localizing to the nucleoli. Moreover, the prevention of the nucleolus localization of WNVCp by Hsp70 might protect cells from the cytotoxic effect of WNVCp (Fig. 4) . To examine the cellular effect of WNVCp, we transfected the plasmid expressing WNVCp into the 293T cells and observed the cell cycle in the 293T cells. The data showed that WNVCp-induced G 2 arrest in 293T cells ( Fig. 5A and B, lane 2) . When Hsp70 was co-expressed, the cytotoxic effect of WNVCp was extinguished, which indicates that Hsp70 has a protective role against WNVCp ( Fig. 5A and B, lane 4) . It is assumed that, by forming a complex, Hsp70 inhibited the localization of WNVCp to the nucleoli and prevented the cytotoxic effect of the viral protein. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that Hsp70 is able to indirectly protect the cells from cytotoxic effects imposed by WNVCp, since Hsp70 generally functions against various stresses exerted on cells [1] . Our findings suggest that WNVCp could function as a negative regulator of Hsp70 chaperone activities by binding to the substrate binding domain of Hsp70 (Fig. 2) . At the same time, the cellular stresses imposed by WNVCp could be protected against by the ectopic expression of Hsp70 (Fig. 5) . WNVCp does not seem to bind to Hsp70 as an unfolded substrate, which could prevent its chaperoning of other substrates, as ATP did not have any effects on the binding abilities of Hsp70 and WNVCp (Fig. 1) . Thus, it is possible that Hsp70 might function as a negative regulatory protein of WNVCp, which weakened the cytotoxic effects of WNVCp. However, it is still not clear from these studies whether the toxic effect of WNV itself could be prevented by the overexpression of Hsp70. Furthermore, it has not yet been determined whether infection with WNV induced the expression of Hsp70, which, in turn, might function to protect cells from WNV-induced death. However, our studies suggest the possible role of Hsp70 as a protector of the cell against infection with WNV through the suppression of one of the toxic proteins of WNV. Although further studies are required to determine the detailed mechanistic pathways involved in the relationship between Hsp70 and WNV infection, this is a novel finding that suggests how WNV protein could be negatively controlled by the proteins of host cells. We expect that this finding will aid investigators in identifying the mechanistic pathway of how mammalian cells adjust to the WNV infection.",
