Methods One-hundred ninety two participants aged 65 and over completed interview-based questionnaires about chronotype, insomnia, depression, and anxiety. Additionally, a small subset of subjects completed a 7-day sleep diary and actigraphy measurements. Results Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) scores were significantly negatively correlated with Midpoint of sleep on free days corrected for sleep debt accumulated through weekdays (MSFsc) (r=-0.45, p<0.01) assessed by the MCTQ. MSFsc using the MCTQ was significantly positively correlated with MSFsc assessed by both the sleep diary (r=0.74, p<0.05) and actigraphy (r=0.76, p<0.05). Additionally, MSFsc assessed by the MCTQ was significantly positively correlated with insomnia (r=0.26, p<0.01), depression (r=0.25, p<0.01), and anxiety (r=0.18, p<0.05). Finally, based on MEQ scores, we derived a cut-off score for the MCTQ that distinguishes morning type and other types (intermediate/evening types) in older adults. Conclusion The results of these studies supported the validity of the MCTQ in Korean older adults. Additionally, while sleep rhythms in elder adults may be more advanced, eveningness tendency may be still important and indicative of sleep and psychological disturbance.

            "text": "Sleep disorders in Korea have been steadily increasing. 1 Although sleep disturbances are present in all age groups, the prevalence of sleep disorders in the elderly is high due to the normal aging process as well as comorbidity with various physical and mental disorders. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Advances in the circadian rhythm due to aging affects sleep in the elderly, usually characterized by waking up early and feeling excessively sleepy in the afternoon. Changes in circadian rhythm are a direct cause of sleep disturbance, 3, 10 and are associated with circadian rhythm sleep disorders, especially advanced sleep phase type (ASPS) in the elderly. 11 Chronotype is defined as the sleep-wake time preference based on the individual's circadian rhythm. Previous studies have found that an overall strong preference for eveningness tendencies is associated with higher severity of depression, insomnia and anxiety in all age groups. [12] [13] [14] Consistent findings were also reported in the elderly group, despite having a large proportion of advanced circadian rhythm. 9, 15, 16 Thus, chronotype appears to be an important factor to consider in the elderly in the context of sleep disturbances and psychological factors.",

These results are similar to evening types in younger age groups in previous studies. 16, 19, [58] [59] [60] While our study categorized our sample into morning types and other types, this categorization is arbitrary as people fall on the spectrum of eveningness and morningness. Considering this continuum, our results suggest that some individuals grouped into other types in our study may have more eveningness tendencies than their counterparts of similar age, but display advanced sleep patterns due to sleep changes with aging. Although elderly participants with other types had a higher depression score than their counterparts with morning type, this difference was not statistically significant. This may be due to the fact that the current sample included the elderly who visit local community elderly centres. They engage in daily activities and have more social support, which may serve as a buffer against depression. Additionally, the sample size for other types was small. Taken together, our results suggest that the elderly group requires clinical interventions for other types (intermediate and evening) compared to morning types. Further studies should investigate whether being an intermediate and evening type may warrant interventions that are similar to evening types in younger age groups, as evening types are rare in elderly populations.",
