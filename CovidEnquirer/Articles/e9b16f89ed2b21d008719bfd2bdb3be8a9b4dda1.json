            "text": "The carboxypeptidase activity occurring in hog intestinal mucosa is apparently due to two distinct enzymes which may be responsible for the release of basic COOH-terminal amino acids from short peptides. The plasma membrane-bound carboxypeptidase activity which occurs at neutral optimum pH levels was found to be enhanced by CoCl 2 and inhibited by guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid, o-phenanthroline, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and cadmium acetate; whereas the soluble carboxypeptidase activity which occurs at an optimum pH level of 5.0 was not activated by CoCl 2 and only slightly inhibited by o-phenanthroline, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, NiCl 2 and CdCl 2 . The latter activity was presumably due to lysosomal cathepsin B, which is known to be present in the soluble fraction of hog intestinal mucosa. Although the membrane-bound enzyme was evenly distributed along the small intestine, it was not anchored in the phospholipidic bilayer via a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol moiety, as carboxypeptidase M from human placenta is. The enzyme was not solubilized by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, but was solubilized to practically the same extent by several detergents. The purified trypsin-solubilized form is a glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 200 kDa, as determined by performing SDSP AGE and gel filtration, which differs considerably from the molecular mass of human placental carboxypeptidase M (62 kDa). It was found to cleave lysyl bonds more rapidly than arginyl bonds, which is not so in the case of carboxypeptidase M, and immunoblotting analysis provided further evidence that hog intestinal and human placental membrane-bound carboxypeptidases do not bear much resemblance to each other. Since the latter enzyme has been called carboxypeptidase M, it is suggested that the former might be carboxypeptidase D, the recently described new member of the carboxypeptide B-type family. \u00df 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Since CPN has mainly been found in circulating blood, its most likely function seems to be to protect the organism from the action of potent vasoactive and in\u00a3ammatory peptides such as kinins and/or anaphylatoxins [1, 4] . A plasma pro-CPB of hepatic origin which is structurally similar to pancreatic pro-CPB has recently been identi\u00a2ed as a circulating protein, isolated from the blood, and found to form a non-covalent association with other plasma proteins [5, 6] . Unlike pancreatic CPB, which has a purely digestive function, plasma CPB might be involved in \u00a2brinolysis and has been de\u00a2ned as a thrombin activatable \u00a2brinolysis inhibitor, or TAFI [7, 8] .",

Subcellular fractionation yielded a microvillar membrane fraction containing about 40% of the total basic CP activity and a soluble fraction containing the remaining 60% (Table 1) . When the microvillar membrane fraction was washed with 2 M NaCl, no signi\u00a2cant release of basic CP activity into the \u00a2nal supernatant was observed, which indicates that the enzyme was probably tightly bound to the intestinal cell membranes. Two di\u00a1erent pH activity pro\u00a2les were obtained when the membrane-bound and soluble CP activities were tested with hippuryl-L-Arg at pH values ranging from 3.0 to 9.0 (Fig. 1) . In the microvillar membrane fractions, the activity was highest at pH 7.5, and the enzyme was still 72% active at pH 9.0, whereas the activity dropped sharply at acidic pH levels and was practically nil below pH 4.5. These \u00a2ndings are in agreement with those obtained on CPM from human placenta and from MDCK cells [21, 50] . Hog intestinal basic CP showed the highest level of activity at pH 5.0 with the soluble enzyme, and was still 57% active at pH 3.0, but its activity dropped sharply at basic pH levels. All these data suggested either that CPH may have been present, or that the lysosome did not remain intact during the subcellular fractionation, which would result in the soluble fractions being contaminated with lysosomal enzymes, which was apparently the case (Table 1) . It was therefore concluded that the soluble CP activity showing an acidic optimum pH might be that of cathepsin B (also named lysosomal carboxypeptidase), which is not a metallocarboxypeptidase, but a cysteine proteinase [51] . This hypothesis was further con\u00a2rmed upon testing the e\u00a1ects of some inhibitors and activators on the enzyme activity at acidic pH levels.",

The fact that no SH group was involved in the enzymatic activity was con\u00a2rmed by the lack of e\u00a1ect of HgCl 2 . As in the case of other mammalian basic CP, CoCl 2 increased the membrane-bound CP peptidase activity, while cadmium acetate was slightly inhibitory. As regards the soluble basic CP activity, no activation was observed with CoCl 2 , the speci\u00a2c activator of basic carboxypeptidases, and only 50% inhibition occurred with o-phenanthroline, whereas EDTA and the two metal cations Ni 2 and Cd 2 were almost ine\u00a1ective, in sharp contrast with what occurs in the case of CPH [9] . The subcellular localization, optimum pH and spe-ci\u00a2c activation or inhibition by both CPM and hog intestinal membrane-bound CP reagents were very similar indeed (Table 2) . It seems very likely that the soluble CP activity was mainly due to a lysosomal cathepsin, since this enzyme was also detected in the soluble fractions (data not shown) in the assay on cathepsin B activity with the speci\u00a2c substrate Z-Arg-Arg-AMC.

Here we observed that, in the rat intestine, the speci\u00a2c activity of the microvillar basic CP (about 22.5 nmol/min.mg) does not di\u00a1er signi\u00a2cantly between the duodenum, jejunum and ileum (data not shown).",

The latter two enzymes are generally thought to be suitable markers for labeling proteins anchored by a hydrophobic amino acid residue sequence and by a GPI moiety, respectively, as pointed out by Hooper and Turner [52] in their study on pig kidney microvillar ectoenzymes. It is worth mentioning that only octyl-glucoside and CHAPS, two detergents with high CMC values, e\u00a1ectively released substantial amounts ( s 60%) of GPI-anchored alkaline phosphatase activity, whereas all the detergents used solubilized 60^80% of the membrane-bound APN and basic CP activities.",

This result therefore con\u00a2rms the above conclusion that hog intestinal microvillar basic CP may not be bound to the membrane via a GPI tail like human placental CPM [23] , but via a hydrophobic peptidic anchor.

After tryptic release of the soluble form of basic CP from its hydrophobic peptide anchor, the enzymatic activity remained intact. In addition, trypsin can be expected to cleave o\u00a1 only a relatively short peptide (about 20^30 amino acids) from the whole protein as observed in the case of CPM [50] .

The only basic carboxypeptidase which is known to be a single-chain glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 180 kDa is actually CPD, a carboxypeptidase which was recently characterized and found to have similar enzymatic properties to those of CPH [19] . Upon being subjected to SDS^PAGE, the puri\u00a2ed membrane-bound and soluble forms of CPD from bovine pituitary gland showed a single 180 kDa band in the former case, and a 170 kDa and a 135 kDa band in the latter case [20] .

The trypsin-solubilized form of CP was isolated from the hog intestine, with a speci\u00a2c activity of 100 nmol/min per mg using hippuryl-L-Arg as the substrate. According to its subcellular localization and optimum pH, the enzyme activity greatly resembles that of CPM in the human placenta as well as that of MDCK cells [21, 50] . The basic CP activity was equally distributed between the duodenum, jejunum and ileum, in agreement with the pattern of distribution of CPH in the rat gastrointestinal tract [26] . However, since the methods used by the latter authors were not really speci\u00a2c to CPH activity [27] , the enzyme involved might have been CPM, and this might explain why CPH was sometimes found in areas apparently devoid of any endocrine function in the rat gastrointestinal tract. Although we observed that the ratio between intestinal membranebound and soluble CP activities was the same as that between membrane-bound and soluble CPH [26] , it is worth noting that two distinct enzymes with di\u00a1erent optimum pH values and behavior towards activators and inhibitors were found to exist in hog intestine. The soluble CP activity was probably due to cathepsin B, a cysteine enzyme of lysosomal origin with several endo-and exopeptidase activities [51, 55] usually found in the gastroduodenal mucosa [56, 57] . This enzyme, which is not a metallocarboxypeptidase, was not further characterized in this study.",

Consequently, this cell-surface peptidase is probably anchored by a sequence of hydrophobic amino acid residues to the lipid bilayer. The basic carboxypeptidases present in human and hog kidney microvillar membranes are known to have the same pattern of solubilization by detergents and to resist solubilization by PI-PLC [53] , whereas CPM from human placenta and that from MDCK cells are anchored via a GPI tail [23, 50] . The discovery in human placenta of a membrane-bound carboxypeptidase which was not GPI-anchored and had di\u00a1erent characteristics from those of CPM [23] may support the idea that membrane-bound CPM is not the sole microvillar carboxypeptidase. Since Hooper and Turner [53] described the solubilization of basic CP from the rat kidney without further characterizing the enzyme, it is therefore possible that the microvillar membrane-bound carboxypeptidase is another member of the B-type carboxypeptidase family. A placental enzyme distinct from CPM was recently partially puri\u00a2ed and denoted CPD [58] , a basic carboxypeptidase which was still unknown when the present work was carried out.",

            "text": "As the various carboxypeptidases described so far have the same catalytic properties, their speci\u00a2c biological function must depend mainly on their site of action, which is generally directly related to their physical state (e.g., solubilized vs membrane-bound). It is therefore widely recognized that the pancreatic CPB present in the intestine in the form of a soluble enzyme contributes along with other digestive enzymes to degrading food proteins and peptides, whereas CPH in the secretory granules of neuroendocrine tissues might be involved in the maturation and sorting of peptidic hormones [60, 61] . Two other carboxypeptidases present in most mammalian tissues and organs, namely CPN, which circulates in the blood, and CPM, which is bound to the plasma membrane of several cells, play key physiological roles, consisting of regulating the activity of various peptides. These two enzymes in particular have been described as kininases [62] , although their exact function has not yet been established. The function of CPD is still unknown, but the recent \u00a2nding that it is located mainly in the trans-Golgi network is consistent with the idea that it is involved in the processing of a broad range of proteins that transit along the secretory pathway, playing a similar role to that of CPH in prohormone processing in the regulated secretory pathway [63] . In addition, the \u00a2nding that CPD is recycled from the cell surface to the trans-Golgi network constitutes important evidence supporting the suggestion that it may act as a receptor for hepatitis B virus [63] . Another metal containing peptidase, aminopeptidase N, has been found to be a coronavirus receptor [64, 65] . The question as to whether the intestinal membrane-bound basic CP has a speci\u00a2c and exclusive degradative role completing that of pancreatic CPB, or is involved independently or concomitantly in the regulation of some of the active biological peptides present in the luminal secretions of the intestine, as well as in the immunological response of the intestinal mucosa to the presence of exogenous peptidic antigens, still remains to be elucidated.",
