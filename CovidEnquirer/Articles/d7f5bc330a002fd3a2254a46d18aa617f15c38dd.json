            "text": "Background: Delayed-onset urticarial or maculopapular rashes are frequently observed in children treated with b-lactams. Many are labeled ''allergic'' without reliable testing. Objective: Determine the etiology of these rashes by exploring both infectious and allergic causes. Methods: Children presenting to the emergency department with delayed-onset urticarial or maculopapular rashes were enrolled. Acute and convalescent sera were obtained for viral screening along with a throat swab. Subjects underwent intradermal and patch skin testing for b-lactams 2 months after presentation. Anti-b-lactam blood allergy tests were also obtained. All subjects underwent an oral challenge test (OCT) with the culprit antibiotic. Results: Eighty-eight children were enrolled between 2006 and 2008. There were 11 (12.5%) positive intradermal and no positive patch tests. There were 2 (2.3%) positive blood allergy tests. There were 6 (6.8%) subjects with a positive OCT, 2 were intradermal-negative, and 4 were intradermal-positive. No OCT reactions were more severe than the index event. Most subjects had at least 1 positive viral study, 54 (65.9%) in the OCT negative group. Conclusion: In this situation, b-lactam allergy is clearly overdiagnosed because the skin rash is only rarely reproducible (6.8%) by a subsequent challenge. Viral infections may be an important factor in many of these rashes. OCTs were positive in a minority of intradermal skin test-positive subjects. Patch testing and blood allergy testing provided no useful information. OCTs should be considered in all children who develop a delayed-onset urticarial or maculopapular rash during treatment with a b-lactam. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2011;127:218-22.) ",

            "text": "Antibiotics are the most frequent drugs prescribed in children worldwide. The b-lactams are the most prescribed group of antibiotics, with somewhere between 3.6 g and 23 g per 1000 people per day prescribed in Europe. 1 In children treated with b-lactams, skin rashes, mostly described as maculopapular or urticarial, are frequently reported by primary care physicians. 2 Such rashes are frequently assumed to be a drug-related allergy, although viral infection is also often considered on the differential diagnosis. 3 It has been suggested that most of these rashes are actually not allergic in origin. 4, 5 However, in clinical practice, the large majority of these children are labeled ''penicillin-allergic'' without appropriate testing, mostly for fear of a more severe allergic reaction. Most of the time, this diagnosis persists until adulthood. As a result, they may be denied the optimal antimicrobial coverage of first choice antibiotic treatment and are often treated with a more costly antibiotic. On average, prescription costs are 30% to 40% higher in patients with a suspected penicillin allergy. 6 Currently, clear figures on the rate of true penicillin allergy among children who develop a rash during b-lactam treatment, and a useful investigational protocol for these patients, are lacking. Several immunologic mechanisms can cause allergy to b-lactams. Identification of IgE-mediated allergy, with its potential for anaphylactic, life-threatening reaction, is essential. This type of reaction generally occurs within 1 hour of receiving the medication and is classified as an immediate reaction. 7 The incidence of these potentially severe reactions is very low (1/100,000). 8 Nonimmediate reactions, which usually manifest as maculopapular or urticarial rashes, occur more than 1 hour after drug intake 9 and are far more common. It is suspected that these rashes are T-cell-mediated. 10 Currently, the diagnosis is mostly assessed by using skin tests (to exclude an IgE-mediated allergy), and in negative skin test patients an oral challenge test (OCT), considered the gold standard, is occasionally performed. 9 Better diagnosis in children with suspected penicillin allergy would directly benefit affected children, provide better treatment guidance for their physicians, and might contribute to lower health costs.",

At the inclusion visit, patients underwent clinical evaluation composed of a medical history and physical examination, and pictures of the skin lesions were taken. Urticaria was defined as disseminated, rapidly evolving, and transient itchy wheals with individual lesions lasting less than 24 hours. A maculopapular rash was defined as small confluent erythematous maculae or papules persisting more than 24 hours, also disseminated over different parts of the body. Blood was drawn to measure for antibodies to viruses known to be associated with childhood skin rashes (Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], human herpes virus 6 [HHV6], cytomegalovirus [CMV], parvovirus B19). All patients also had a throat swab for respiratory virus screening by PCR according to previously published methods. 11, 12 Viruses screened for via throat swab included picorna, corona, human metapneumovirus, bocavirus, influenza, and parainfluenza viruses. 13 During the second visit (2 months later), a second determination of viral serologies (EBV, CMV, HHV6, and parvovirus B19) was performed, and all patients underwent a complete allergy work-up following European Network for Drug Allergy/European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology guidelines for work-up of subjects with a suspicion of nonimmediate reaction to b-lactams. 9 Intradermal skin tests were performed on the forearm with penicilloyl-polylysine (PPL) and minor determinant mixture (MDM; Diater, Madrid, Spain) with a standard concentration, and with amoxicillin (Clamoxyl; GlaxoSmithKline, Munchenbuchsee, Switzerland), at a concentration of 25 mg/mL after dilution in 0.9% NaCl. On the basis of our experience and to limit painful skin testing, we did not perform a first test at a lower concentration than 25 mg/mL. If a cephalosporin was incriminated, the work-up was completed with an intradermal skin test to the soluble form of the suspected drug if available (ie, ceftriaxone; Rocephin; Roche Pharma, Basle, Switzerland; and cefuroxime; Zinacef; GlaxoSmithKline; both at concentrations of 3 mg/mL). 3 Skin test responses were assessed at 15 to 20 minutes. A wheal equal or superior than 3 mm in diameter in the absence of a wheal to the control solution (diluent; Diater) and in the presence of a positive response to histamine (skin prick test, 10 mg/mL) was defined as an immediate positive response. Patch test solutions were prepared by mixing the incriminated drug in petrolatum at a concentration of 5%. 9 Negative controls were performed with petrolatum alone in each individual tested. All reagents were applied to uninvolved skin on the interscapular region of the patient's back by using acrylate adhesive strips with small plates attached for test allergens (IQ ultra chambers; Dormer Laboratories, Rexdale, Ontario, Canada).",

To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study of drug allergy prevalence in which all subjects, regardless of skin test outcome, were rechallenged. In this study, a rash was reproduced on OCT in only 6 of 88 challenged patients (6.8%; 95% CI, 2.5-14.2). These findings are highly relevant to clinical practice because most of these patients would otherwise have been falsely labeled ''penicillin-allergic.'' Rashes are frequent in childhood, with an estimated incidence of approximately 150 cases per 10,000. 15 There are many potential causes of pediatric rashes, especially among children with an intercurrent illness being treated with antibiotics. Viral infections are the most common cause of maculopapular or urticarial eruptions, independent of medication. The rate of exanthema in viral infection is highly variable depending on the virus. 13, 16 In our study, we screened for viruses most commonly known to be associated with a rash by using PCR and serologic analysis. The vast majority of children with a negative subsequent OCT tested positive for viral infection, mostly enteroviruses (picornavirus), at their initial visit. These viruses could be the cause of the index rash in some of these patients. Similar to nonimmediate allergic reactions, viral-induced exanthemas are immunologically mediated, with T cells playing a central role. However, major differences have been shown in the immunologic mechanism suspected. 17 The negative viral screening results in patients with a subsequent negative OCT may be a result of limitations in testing technique or other infectious triggers, such as viruses not screened for, or bacterial infections.",

By definition, these reactions are reproducible. In our study, this reproducibility was demonstrated in only a low proportion of patients (6.8%). Potentialization of a drug-related rash by the inflammatory reaction of an infection can certainly not be excluded. The pathogenesis of cutaneous drug reactions during viral infections may involve viral-induced polyclonal activation of lymphocytes, other reactions involving cellular immunity, or alterations of drug metabolism. 18 EBV is the best known example of a viral risk factor for cutaneous drug reactions. Reactions in patients subsequently found to be infected with EBV are traditionally not considered to belong to drug allergies. An intriguing result of our study is that 3 of the 6 patients who had a positive OCT tested positive for an acute EBV infection. In these cases, the persistence of an EBV-induced inflammation could have favored the reaction induced by the OCT. It is also possible that EBV infections might change the pattern of reactivity to antibiotics, because persistent delayed-type reactions to amoxicillin, instead of the classic transient decrease in drug tolerance during EBV infection, have been reported. 19 Although these conclusions are speculative, they should encourage further investigations in patients with amino-penicillin-induced exanthema during EBV infection. The diagnostic allergy work-up in patients who developed a rash remains controversial. We strongly emphasize that the patient's history is essential for confirming the diagnosis-for example, by using the ENDA questionnaire. 20 Although a recent study investigated diagnostic tests to differentiate between a viral and a drug-induced exanthema, no test has been validated so far. 21 The analysis of the diagnostic value of common allergy tests (skin tests and specific IgE) was hampered by the surprisingly low number of patients with a positive OCT. Our study does show a good specificity (91.5%) for intradermal skin tests but a sensitivity of only 66.7%, a number slightly higher than previously reported. 22 A low rate of reactions in skin test-positive patients after re-exposure to the antibiotic has also been reported by others in a retrospective study. 23 Current guidelines suggest that immediate reading of intradermal skin tests should be done only in immediate reactions suspected to be IgE-mediated. 9 In our study, only 1 patient developed an immediate reaction. If immediate readings of intradermal tests were considered to predict only immediate reactions, the sensitivity would be even lower (16.7%), with a specificity of 87.8%. As in previous studies, 24, 25 we found a very high negative predictive value for intradermal skin tests (97.4%).",

However, none of these patients developed an immediate and/or a severe reaction. Thus, a 1-dose OCT in patients with a history of a benign reaction can be considered safe. In the meantime, we have challenged more than 150 children in our referral clinic with the 1-dose protocol, followed by a 30-minute observation, without any significant reactions.
