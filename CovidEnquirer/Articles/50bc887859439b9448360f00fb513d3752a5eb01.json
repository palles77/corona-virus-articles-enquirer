In the present study, 3 duck PPAR\u03b3 small interfering RNA (siRNA) expression plasmids were constructed to investigate the effect of downregulating the expression of PPAR\u03b3 on adipogenesis and fat accumulation in ducks. The results indicate that the 3 siRNA specific for conserved regions of PPAR\u03b3 can effectively inhibit expression of PPAR\u03b3. It was demonstrated that the expression of lipoprotein lipase and adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein in duck adipose tissue is repressed when the expression of PPAR\u03b3 is downregulated by siRNA. At the same time, the weight of abdominal fat at 21 and 35 d of age is decreased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with the control. However, the triglyceride levels in serum and muscle are not affected when the mRNA of PPAR\u03b3 is repressed. The current study indicates that the suppression of PPAR\u03b3 reduces abdominal fat deposition and regulates adipogenesis in ducks.",

            "text": "Adipose tissue, a major energy reservoir in animals, is associated with nutrient intake and endocrine signaling. It stores excess energy in the form of triglycerides (TG) and releases the stored TG as free fatty acids and glycerol when necessary (Mandrup and Lane, 1997; Anghel et al., 2007) . This is true in food animals as well. Modern selective breeding has been successful in improving both egg and meat production in recent years, and the target of intensive selection in modern commercial meat lines is to increase growth rate and muscle mass (Huang et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2007; Brun et al., 2008) . However, excessive fat deposition has also accompanied these selective progresses. Excessive fat in ducks has been one of the major problems for modern duck meat production. It not only reduces carcass yield and the efficiency of feed but also leads to difficulties in processing. Unfortunately, it is likely that breeding techniques will not be able to reduce fat deposition while improving meat production because of the adverse correlation between these traits (Baeza et al., 2002) . Furthermore, little is known regarding lipid metabolism in ducks. It is therefore imperative to study adipogenesis and the genes that regulate the deposition and release of lipids in ducks to discover an approach to decrease excessive fat deposition and maintain the fast growth of ducklings.",

Previous research indicates that the expression of PPAR\u03b3 increases during adipocyte differentiation and induces the accumulation of oil droplets in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, whereas the knockout of PPAR\u03b3 impairs adipocyte differentiation (Rosen et al., 1999) . Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 acts as a nuclear receptor and transactivates multiple target genes involved in lipid metabolic pathways, such as lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) (Nakachi et al., 2008) . Meanwhile, the high affinity of PPAR\u03b3 to thiazolidinediones, insulin-sensitive drugs, suggests that PPAR\u03b3 is also involved in the insulin signaling pathway in mammals (Miles et al., 2003) . However, there is little evidence to prove that PPAR\u03b3 plays a role in modulating fat deposition in ducks, but this will be clarified in the present study.",

It is thought that the ducks deposit fat during the finishing period (start at 21st day), so the diet is changed into a kind of feed with higher metabolic energy at the 21st day to meet the requirement for fat deposition. Because it is reported that the PPAR\u03b3 was expressed at a relatively low level except in fat tissues, we only measured the expression of PPAR\u03b3 in fat tissue. In the current study, we found that after PPAR\u03b3 gene expression is decreased by siRNA in vivo, the weight of abdominal fat is significantly decreased in siRNA-treated ducks compared with the negative control group at ages 21 and 35 d (P < 0.05).

In the current study, the expression of the LPL and FABP4 genes was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) when PPAR\u03b3 protein levels were also decreased. This indicates that LPL and FABP4 may also be the downstream target genes that are regulated by PPAR\u03b3 in duck adipose tissue.

Hepatic lipids are synthesized into very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), which are secreted into the blood, leading to lipid uptake and storage in adipose and other tissues (O'Hea and Leveille, 1969) . Plasma TG are the major components of VLDL in Tsaiya ducks, and increases in the plasma VLDL level can reflect increased liver assembly and secretion of VLDL (Lien et al., 2005; Andre et al., 2007) . A low content of LPL protein causes a decreased TG degradation rate in laying chickens than in the growing chickens (Griffin et al., 1990 ). In the present study on ducks, the TG levels did not obviously decrease in serum at 21 or 35 d of age after the expression of PPAR\u03b3 mRNA was downregulated. This indicates that downregulating PPAR\u03b3 decreased the liver lipogenesis rate and also decreased the rate of VLDL-TG degradation by LPL protein by decreasing the expression of LPL mRNA. Thus, the combination of decreased TG secreted into blood and decreased storage in tissues could maintain the content of VLDL-TG in serum.",

As we know, off-target is major factor that can confound the expected results. There are far more than 3 siRNA designed when we search siRNA using sFold software (Ding et al., 2004) . Off-target effects will be minimized when as few siRNA as possible are needed to knock down their targets, so we chose three of the best of them. These 3 sequences barely have sequence homology with other genes when compared with chicken and duck genomes. Our results show that the PPAR\u03b3 pS-P167 and pS-P273 siRNA can effectively suppress the expression of PPAR\u03b3. The reason for the lower efficiency of the pS-P271 siRNA may be due to positional effects.",
