[3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] However, data for pregnant patients are limited to anecdotal experience with the small number admitted to hospital. WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have published diagnostic criteria for SARS that are currently based on clinical (temperature >38\u00b0C, symptoms of respiratory illness, radiographic evidence of pneumonia, autopsy findings), epidemiological (close contact within 10 days with a person known or suspected to have SARS or travel within 10 days to an affected area) and laboratory (isolation of SARS-CoV, detection of antibody to SARS-CoV or detection of SARS-CoV RNA) features. 10;11 There is no reason why pregnant patients should be different. Whether pregnancy itself alters the presentation or course of SARS is unknown. Features of pregnancy that may be important include increased metabolic rate, oxygen requirement, carbon dioxide production and cardiac and respiratory work and decreased cellular immunity. Increased pulmonary blood volume and decreased plasma oncotic pressure may predispose to the development of adult respiratory distress syndrome. In Hong Kong, as of early May 2003, five pregnant women beyond 24 weeks of gestation had been diagnosed with SARS. Four required admission to the intensive care unit. Two died.",

Current medical treatment of SARS includes use of antiviral agents, such as ribavirin, and corticosteroids. Ribavirin has teratogenic effects in animals. 12 Although fewer data are available for humans, 13 for patients less than 24 weeks' gestation the option of termination of pregnancy should be discussed. After 24 weeks' gestation, the maternal and fetal risks of continuation of pregnancy must be balanced against the morbidity and mortality of preterm delivery. The timing and mode of delivery remain contentious issues among obstetricians. In general, continuation of pregnancy is favoured, especially for gestations less than 32-34 weeks, but maternal deterioration or poor response to medical therapy warrants consideration of early delivery.",

At the time of writing, three neonates from mothers with SARS in Hong Kong had been admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. Their gestations ranged from 27 to 32 weeks, and their problems were similar to those of other premature infants. Two suffered gut perforation; both of their mothers had received high dose corticosteroids before delivery but whether this contributed to their outcome is unknown. Vertical transmission of SARS is another concern. This has not been confirmed in our cases. However, current clinical diagnostic criteria are not easily applied to neonates and it is difficult to differentiate between the clinical features and radiological changes of SARS and those of respiratory distress syndrome caused by prematurity.",

A concern of regional anaesthesia is the potential for spread of virus to the central nervous system. However, this argument has not precluded use of regional anaesthesia with other viral infections, most notably human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 14 SARS-CoV has been identified in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with SARS, which could mean that, as with HIV, fears of seeding infection by lumbar puncture are exaggerated. Regional anaesthesia adversely affects pulmonary mechanics, 15 however, and its use may not be tolerated in patients with compromised respiratory function. Furthermore, logistics and resource limitations may preclude provision of safe regional analgesia in an isolation area. On the other hand, general anaesthesia in pregnant patients with SARS has the same disadvantages as in healthy patients. There is additional concern that it may adversely International Journal of Obstetric Anesthesia (2003) 12, 151-152 \u00d3 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

            "text": "Beyond the clinical considerations for the welfare of mother and fetus, the unique and overriding consideration for management of patients with SARS is prevention of cross-infection to staff. Over 20% of cases of SARS in Hong Kong have been in healthcare workers. What does this mean for obstetric care? There should be designated areas, preferably with negative pressure, for SARS patients. Labour wards should be considered ultra-high risk areas because of the nature of delivery and the procedures performed. Hospital infection control guidelines are available on the websites of WHO (http://www.who.int/ csr/sars/guidelines/en) and CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/ ncidod/sars/clinicians.htm). These should be taken very seriously. A case-control analysis of staff exposed to index patients highlighted the importance of hand-washing, use of gloves and gowns and especially wearing of masks to prevent spread by droplets. 18 Unfortunately, many healthcare workers have been infected despite the implementation of protective measures and sadly some have died. Factors that may have contributed to infection among hospital staff include failure to apply isolation precautions to cases not yet identified as having SARS, breaches of procedure, and inadequate precautions. 17 Labour ward staff in countries affected by SARS must maintain an extremely high index of suspicion. As we have progressed through multiple generations of infection, it has not always been possible to establish links between patients and known sources of infection. It is not known whether patients are infectious before they develop symptoms. Cases reported may only be those with the most severe clinical symptoms of infection with SARS-CoV; 7 the possibility of subclinical infection raises the spectre of asymptomatic carriers. But treating every pregnant patient as potentially infectious, as we are currently doing in Hong Kong, has considerable logistic, clinical and financial implications.",
