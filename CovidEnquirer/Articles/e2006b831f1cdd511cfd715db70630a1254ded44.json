Studies of health worker or household contacts of confirmed cases, adult blood donors or children hospitalized with unspecified lower respiratory tract disease have not reported neutralizing antibody to MERS-CoV [12] [13] [14] . Similarly, human sera from animal workers have not contained neutralizing antibodies [13, 15] . Here, antibody absence may reflect sampling from 2012 or earlier, before MERS-CoV had established itself. Alternatively, current serological assays may not be sufficiently sensitive to detect seroconversion in mild and subclinical disease, or such cases may not mount an immune response. However, a recent large study of sera, mostly collected after 2012, successfully identified seroconversions among 0.15% of human sera from six of the Kingdom's 13 provinces. Antibodies were present more frequently among those occupationally exposed to animals, but often without a remembered history of illness [16] . Given the low proportion, it is not surprising that a much smaller number of sera collected in 2014 did not show evidence of seroconversion among camel herders and others despite close camel contact [17] . MERS-CoV RNA is shed from mild or subclinical infections, explaining how MERS-CoV transmission could side-step the camel and also why fewer than half of human cases report camel contact [2, 18] . The description of a health worker who shed viral RNA from the upper respiratory tract for more than 40 days without signs of disease further supports the concept of occult spread [9] .",

The majority of reported MERS cases occurred in association with a healthcare setting and health worker infections spike as healthcare venues became hubs for viral transmission. It remains unclear if this is where most transmission occurs, or just where the most obvious clinical outcomes collect and are observed. Better selection and implementation of tried and trusted infection prevention and control measures is needed to reduce human-to-human infections here [19] . Such measures would also reduce transmission of other respiratory viruses, which are capable of increased morbidity and mortality among the Kingdom's atrisk and hospitalized populations.",

The knowledge gaps hinder strategic infection prevention and control and restrict the tailoring of public health messages seeking to prevent exposure to infection by breaking habits and generally reducing risk. Finding the missing pieces will also help define how best to clean hospital surfaces during and after a patient's stay, when trained health workers should don protective equipment and what that equipment should be. The aim is to reduce overall morbidity and mortality due to respiratory infections but particularly the seasonal occurrence of MERS-CoV outbreaks in hospitals. The lack of immediacy exhibited by the Kingdom, from where most cases have been reported, continues to draw criticism from many levels [20, 21] . Three years on, assembly of the puzzle that is MERS still requires the commitment to collaborate, focus, organize and communicate effectively, leading to outcomes of application and action.",
