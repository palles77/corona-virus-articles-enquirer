Usually, the clinical course of the disease suggests an acute infection, presumably viral, although to date extensive virologic studies from our institution and elsewhere have been unrewarding.i, 2 Nevertheless, we have begun a series of experiments to explore the mechanisms that cause diarrhea in a specific enteric viral infection in swine, transmissible gastroenteritis. This report will deal with our initial observations which characterize the clinical response and the diarrhea in this disease. Also, we will describe data on the activities of certain intestinal mucosal enzymes, in particular, sodium-potassium-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (Na-K-ATPase). This information may provide a clue to the site and nature of the primary defect of intestinal function and may lead to a greater understanding of a potentially fatal disease in infants.",
