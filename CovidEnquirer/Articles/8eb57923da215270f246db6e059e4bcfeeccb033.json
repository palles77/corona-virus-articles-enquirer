            "text": "Lawsonia intracellularis is the etiologic agent of the recently recognized and emerging intestinal disease in horses called equine proliferative enteropathy (EPE). Lawsonia intracellularis is an obligate intracellular, curved, gram-negative bacterium that resides freely within the apical cytoplasm of infected intestinal enterocytes. 1 It causes proliferation of the affected enterocytes, resulting in a thickened small and sometimes large intestine. Lawsonia intracellularis can only be grown in vitro in cell culture and requires a specific atmosphere for growth. Besides horses, L. intracellularis infects many species of domestic and wild animals, including pigs, hamsters, rabbits, foxes, deer, ferrets, ostriches, and nonhuman primates. Equine proliferative enteropathy was first reported in horses in 1982 by Duhamel and Wheeldon. 2 Since 1996, several reports of sporadic cases and outbreaks on breeding farms have been described. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] In the last few years, reported cases of EPE have been increasing, occurring primarily in postweaning foals and occasionally in adult horses. The disease has almost reached a worldwide occurrence and has been reported in the United States, Canada, Europe, South Africa, Australia, Brazil, and Japan.",

            "text": "Molecular investigations of L. intracellularis isolates from proliferative enteropathy lesions of a variety of animal species, including horses and hamsters, showed 98% homology of the 16S-ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA) gene to pig isolates. 21 Moreover, phenotypic characterization of outer membrane proteins and immunoblots of different L. intracellularis isolates using several antibodies and more sensitive molecular characterizations of the L. intracellularis genome demonstrated only minor differences among isolates. None of these differences appears to be antigenically relevant. Recently, the whole genome of a porcine L. intracellularis isolate was sequenced and analyzed for the presence of variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) sequences. 22 Variable number tandem repeat sequences in the genomes of prokaryotes are often associated with a high level of polymorphism and enable bacterial strain differentiation with substantial discriminatory power. Use of these L. intracellularis VNTR sequences provides a sensitive method for analysis of the genetic relatedness of L. intracellularis bacteria or DNA obtained from various temporal and geographic locations and from various animal species. This provided insight into the phylogenetic relatedness of these isolates. Molecular VNTR sequence profiles of L. intracellularis isolates from various documented outbreaks of proliferative enteropathy occurring in pigs, horses, ostriches, spider monkeys, ferrets, and hamsters were analyzed. The patterns that emerged provide some insight into the sources and phylogenetic relatedness of L. intracellularis isolates from different species. Variable number tandem repeat sequence types obtained from pigs were very different from those obtained from horses or other nonpig species. Little or no genetic variation was found between isolates from within outbreaks for any animal species or in multiple temporal samples taken from the same outbreak site. Slight variations between isolates obtained from outbreaks at different geographic locations were found, but these differences were minor. Marked variation in VNTR types were found, however, between isolates from pig sources and those obtained from non-pig sources including horses ( Fig. 34-1 ).",

[24] [25] [26] Rodents appear to be suitable reservoir hosts because of their susceptibility to L. intracellularis, their close contact to domestic animals, and their high reproductive rate, which maintains L. intracellularis across generations. The source of infection has not been determined for horses. Exposure to pig feces has been suggested as a potential source of infection for horses since the first reported cases of EPE. However, in most cases of EPE, no history or evidence of direct or indirect exposure to pigs or pig feces has been reported. Further, multilocus VNTR profile of pig and equine isolates differ greatly. 22 Non-pig *The authors acknowledge and appreciate the original contributions of these authors, whose work has been incorporated into this chapter. associated with proliferative enteropathy follows an increase in numbers of intracellular L. intracellularis in enterocytes. Likewise, resolution of the lesions is closely related to disappearance of the intracellular organisms, indicating a correlation between the two events. 1 The means by which L. intracellularis produces hyperplasia is unknown. No other cytopathologic effects on infected enterocytes are seen in vivo or in vitro. Inflammation becomes evident in later-stage lesions and is not characteristic of the primary lesion.",

The cell-mediated immune response may be an important feature in protecting animals from reinfection with L. intracellularis.

The disease is generally manifested in foals less than 1 year of age, and in North America, EPE is often seen between August and January. 16 Although the disease is commonly seen in weanling foals 4 to 7 months of age, cases of EPE have been seen in young adults (Pusterla, personal communication) .

Previous studies have shown that a variety of wild and domestic animals, including dogs, cats, rabbits, opossums, skunks, mice, and coyotes, can shed L. intracellularis on farms with diagnosed EPE cases. [28] [29] On a recently identified farm in California endemic for EPE, 7.5% of fecal samples and 27% of serum samples from cottontail rabbits tested PCR positive and seropositive for L. intracellularis, respectively. 29 Of interest was that on this farm, a large population of cottontail rabbits lived in the hay barn and had direct access to the hay fed to the horses. An epidemiologic investigation on this farm showed rabbit feces on top of hay bales but also in the feeders of the weanling foals, suggesting that the foals developing EPE were likely exposed to L. intracellularis via the oral ingestion of infected rabbit feces. Similar to rodents, lagomorphs may represent an effective reservoir/amplifier host because of their large population, their close contact to horses, and their short reproductive cycle. It still remains to be determined how L. intracellularis became endemic in the rabbit population on this farm.",

Although the natural infectious dose for foals has not been determined, pigs receiving as low as 10 5 L. intracellularis have been shown to develop infection. 32 Recent work suggested that 1 g of infectious feces would suffice to deliver this challenge dose. 25 Likely, the initial transmission of L. intracellularis occurs via the accidental ingestion of infectious feces from one of the described or as yet undetermined amplifiers/hosts. Amplification of L. intracellularis and environmental contamination leading to exposure rates of up to 100% of resident foals are likely to occur secondary to the shedding of large quantities of L. intracellularis from either clinically or subclinically infected foals.",

In a recent case report, 16 hypoalbuminemia was the only consistent clinicopathologic abnormality of 57 affected foals, with albumin concentrations ranging from 0.9 to 3.3 g/ dL (normal reference range 2.7 to 4.2 g/dL). The exact mechanisms by which hypoalbuminemia develops in affected foals has not been investigated. It appears that a combination of decreased feed intake, coupled with malabsorption and protein-losing enteropathy as a result of the proliferative nature of the disease may represent likely mechanisms by which low albumin occurs. 42 Affected foals may also demonstrate nonspecific blood abnormalities such as anemia or hemoconcentration, leukocytosis or neutropenia, hyperfibrinogenemia, increased activity of muscle enzymes, and electrolyte abnormalities (hypocalcemia, hypochloremia, and hyponatremia).

Healthy seronegative herdmates with no hypoproteinemia should continue to be monitored daily for clinical signs and monthly or bimonthly for hypoproteinemia and/or hypoalbuminemia and detectable antibodies to L. intracellularis. Any foal developing clinical signs of EPE should undergo a thorough diagnostic workup.

            "text": "Based on clinical observations, it appears that the exposure rate to L. intracellularis is higher than the clinical attack rate; however, assuming that index cases are only the apex tip of the pyramid, it is always advisable to test herdmates to determine their exposure and clinical status. This is best achieved by collecting blood to determine the level of anti-Lawsonia intracellularis antibodies by serology and to measure total protein concentration by refractometry. Another more expensive alternative is to measure total protein and/or albumin concentrations by chemical analysis. Polymerase chain reaction testing of feces from healthy herdmates is not advised in this situation because of the expense of testing and low rate of positivity. Also, the results from previous epidemiologic studies show that healthy herdmates rarely shed detectable L. intracellularis. 50, 51 Daily syndromic surveillance of all herdmates is also recommended in order to recognize early stages of disease. This is best achieved via daily physical examination, including rectal temperature and the regular assessment of weight, allowing the calculation of daily weight gain. A positive titer by IPMA (\u226560) in a healthy herdmate with no hypoproteinemia should be viewed as past exposure with no apparent disease or possibly early, not yet clinically apparent EPE. Seropositive or seronegative clinically healthy herdmates with hypoproteinemia (<5.0 g/dL) or hypoalbuminemia (<3.0 g/dL) should undergo further diagnostic testing (white blood cell count, abdominal ultrasound examination, fecal PCR) to determine if L. intracel- ",

Treatment of EPE in horses involves the use of antimicrobials such as macrolides, alone or in combination with rifampin, chloramphenicol, oxytetracycline, or doxycycline administered for 2 to 3 weeks. The choice of antimicrobial in the treatment of EPE should take into account the risk of inducing disturbance of the gastrointestinal flora and renal toxicity. This is especially a concern when treating older foals with severe hypoalbuminemia. In addition, supportive care, such as intravenous (IV) fluids, plasma transfusion, parenteral nutrients, and antiulcer drugs are commonly used to treat affected foals. Concurrent medical conditions should also be addressed. Rapid clinical improvement following treatment is to be expected; however, it may take weeks for the hypoproteinemia to resolve. Spontaneous recovery of clinically affected foals has not been documented, and treated foals usually survive the disease. Long-term sequelae have not been reported; however, clinically affected and successfully treated foals sell for an average of 68% of the average price of unaffected foals by the same stallion. 16 ",

This includes the regular physical evaluation of resident foals and the monthly or bimonthly assessment of total protein concentration and monthly serologic status. Monitoring for exposure to L. intracellularis and hypoproteinemia/hypoalbuminemia should begin at least 4 weeks prior to the historic first detection of clinical cases. Monthly data, including concentration of total solids or albumin and weight gains, should be evaluated for each foal and compared to the previous month's data to determine decreasing trends potentially associated with early disease. Recent work performed in central Kentucky has shown a seasonality to EPE cases, with peak cases recorded in November and December. 16 Year-to-year variations, depending on climatic conditions, can be expected; however, most of the EPE cases are seen between August and January in the northern hemisphere, which relates to the age of the foals. Considering the cost of treating a foal with clinical EPE, this monitoring program is cost-effective, especially if concentration of total serum solids can be assessed by farm personnel. The lack of epidemiologic data regarding potential natural reservoir hosts, as well as the lack of information pertaining to the biology of L. intracellularis, precludes the institution of any management changes on endemic farms. Early recognition of clinical cases and separating them from the rest of the susceptible foals until full recovery or cessation of fecal shedding appear to be logical biosecurity measures to prevent spread and environmental contamination. Further, maintaining good pest control and preventing nonequine domestic and wild animals access to feed and feeding areas may potentially minimize the risk of disease spread.",

The histologic lesions of PE are unique and inflammation is not normally a hallmark of disease. Warthin-Starry silver stain allows the detection of the bacteria in histologic sections, improving the diagnostic sensitivity, but the technique has limitations when applied to autolyzed and necrotic samples. 1 Immunohistochemistry procedures, using postmortem tissue or biopsy material with an antibody specific for L. intracellularis, have been used successfully to diagnose EPE (Fig. 34-10) .

Under experimental conditions, weanling foals vaccinated intrarectally with an avirulent live vaccine against L. intracellularis were protected against clinical and subclinical EPE following challenge exposure with a virulent L. intracellularis isolate of equine origin. 34 This was determined by lack of clinical disease, absence of hypoproteinemia and sonographic abnormalities compatible with EPE, and a significant reduction in L. intracellularis fecal shedding in vaccinated foals compared to nonvaccinated foals. Further, average daily weight gains from the vaccinated foals over the entire study period were similar to the control foals and significantly higher when compared to the nonvaccinated foals, highlighting the benefit of the vaccine in the prevention of subclinical disease. The extralabel use of the L. intracellularis vaccine should be considered on na\u00efve and endemic farms in an attempt to reduce or prevent EPE. Timing of vaccine administration should again be synchronized with historic disease occurrence. Further, routine monitoring for clinical signs and hypoproteinemia/hypoalbuminemia is still recommended, even when vaccine prophylaxis is used.The complete reference list is available online at www. equineinfectiousdiseases.com.immunologic responses. 55 The L. intracellularis vaccine is safe, and the administration well tolerated by foals. Further, the avirulent L. intracellularis vaccine has not been associated with the induction of clinical disease in pigs or foals. Fecal shedding for up to 12 days has been documented following intrarectal vaccine administration in foals. 55 Using the previously mentioned protocols, vaccine efficacy has been evaluated in the field and, more recently, under experimental conditions. A field efficacy trial performed on EPE endemic farms in central Kentucky in 2008 showed that vaccinated foals maintained higher daily weight gains and higher total protein concentrations when compared to a nonvaccinated, naturally seroconverted group. 58 Because of the low incidence of disease reported on the study farms, no difference in attack rate between vaccinated and nonvaccinated foals could be determined. The overall decreased disease prevalence in the study population may have been associated with the ongoing vaccine trial on these farms because disease prevalence in central Kentucky did not change in 2009 compared to 2008. Potential explanation of the decreased number of clinical cases was the elimination of so called \"super shedders\" and possible exposure of nonvaccinated foals to L. intracellularis vaccine organism shed in the feces of recently",
