Impaired biosynthetic processing of the cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a cAMP-regulated chloride channel, constitutes the most common cause of CF. Recently, we have identified a distinct category of mutation, caused by premature stop codons and frameshift mutations, which manifests in diminished expression of COOH-terminally truncated CFTR at the cell surface. Although the biosynthetic processing and plasma membrane targeting of truncated CFTRs are preserved, the turnover of the complex-glycosylated mutant is sixfold faster than its wild-type (wt) counterpart. Destabilization of the truncated CFTR coincides with its enhanced susceptibility to proteasome-dependent degradation from post-Golgi compartments globally, and the plasma membrane specifically, determined by pulse-chase analysis in conjunction with cell surface biotinylation. Proteolytic cleavage of the full-length complex-glycosylated wt and degradation intermediates derived from both T70 and wt CFTR requires endolysosomal proteases. The enhanced protease sensitivity in vitro and the decreased thermostability of the complex-glycosylated T70 CFTR in vivo suggest that structural destabilization may account for the increased proteasome susceptibility and the short resi-",

The ER quality control mechanism assures that functionally incompetent, misfolded, or unassembled oligomeric proteins are retained and targeted for proteolysis via the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) 1 pathway (Hurtley and Helnius, 1989; Brodsky and McCracken, 1997; Bonifacino and Weismann, 1998; Ellgaard et al., 1999; Wickner et al., 1999) . The ERAD involves the recognition, dislocation, and proteolysis of misfolded polypeptides by the 26S proteasome, a multicatalytic enzyme complex localized to the cytoplasm and nucleus (Baumeister et al., 1998; Bonifacino and Weismann, 1998; Brodsky and McCracken, 1999; Plemper and Wolf, 1999) . The ATP-dependent cleavage process is facilitated by multiple ubiquitin attachments to the \u2440 -amino groups of lysine residues of the substrate and catalyzed by a cascade of enzymatic reactions involving ubiquitin-activating (E1) and -conjugating (E2) enzymes in addition to ubiquitin-protein ligases (E3) (Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998) .",

CF, the most prevalent recessive genetic disorder in the caucasian population, is caused by the dysfunction of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a member of the ATP-binding cassette transport protein family (Riordan et al., 1989; Rommens et al., 1989) . CFTR is a cAMP-stimulated Cl \u03ea channel, residing predominantly at the cell surface and, less abundantly, in the endosomal compartment (Bradbury, 1999) . The channel consists of two homologous halves, each comprised of six transmembrane helices and a nucleotide binding domain (NBD1 and NBD2), which are connected by the regulatory domain (Riordan et al., 1989) . This complex, multidomain structure conceivably renders the posttranslational folding of wild-type (wt) CFTR inefficient. Approximately 70% of the newly synthesized wt CFTR is trapped in the ER as core-glycosylated folding intermediate (apparent molecular weight \u202b\u0641\u202c 150, 000) and degraded with a t 1/2 of \u202b\u0641\u202c 30 min by the ERAD. Proteasome activity is responsible, at least in part, for the degradation of the co-and posttranslationally ubiquitinated and incompletely folded CFTR at the ER (Jensen et al., 1995; Ward et al., 1995; Xiong et al., 1999) . However, inhibition of proteasomes has failed to promote the processing of core-glycosylated wt as well as the \u232c F508 CFTR (Jensen et al., 1995; Ward et al., 1995) .",

Processing of the high mannose type N-linked glycan to complex type oligosaccharides in the cis/medial Golgi region is reflected by a decreased electrophoretic mobility ( \u202b\u0641\u202c 180 kD), providing a convenient method to monitor the trafficking of the CFTR (Cheng et al., 1990; Lukacs et al., 1994; Ward and Kopito, 1994; Riordan, 1999) . Not only does the folded complex-glycosylated CFTR have a slow turnover in vivo ( t 1/2 \u03fe 12 h), but it also displays a conformation which is more resistant to proteolysis in vitro (Zhang et al., 1998) .

Recently, we have identified a mechanistically distinct category of mutation, caused by premature terminations and frameshift mutations in the CF gene (Haardt et al., 1999) . Although the ER processing of these COOHterminally truncated CFTR variants missing their last 70-82 amino acid residues (T70 and T82 CFTR) is similar to that of the wt form, the biological half-life of the complexglycosylated mutants is sixfold shorter than their wt counterpart (Haardt et al., 1999) . Although the proteolytic elimination mechanism of the processing mutants entrapped in the ER has been extensively studied (Welsh and Smith, 1993; Kopito, 1999; Riordan, 1999) , the cellular processes responsible for the short residence time of the truncated CFTR in post-Golgi compartments remained obscure.",

Structural destabilization, demonstrated by increased pro-tease susceptibility in vitro and diminished thermostability of the complex-glycosylated mutants in vivo, may serve as signal for premature proteolysis. In contrast, lysosomal proteolysis appears to represent the rate-limiting step in the degradation of the complex-glycosylated wt CFTR. These results reveal a novel aspect of the proteasomedependent degradation pathway in the elimination of nonnative CFTR after its escape from the ER quality control.",

After a steady state was reached, the intracellular cAMP level was raised by agonists (10 M forskolin, 0.2 mM CTP-cAMP, and 0.2 mM isobutyl-methyl xanthane) to achieve maximal phosphorylation of the T70 CFTR. The collection of the efflux medium resumed for an additional 6-9 min. The amount of iodide in each sample was determined with an iodide-selective electrode (Orion).",

In contrast, deletion of the last 26 amino acid residues (T26 CFTR) was without effect (Mickle et al., 1998; Haardt et al., 1999) . It was also shown that neither the translational rate nor the biosynthetic maturation of the T70 and T82 CFTR was significantly impaired at the ER in transient COS-1 (Haardt et al., 1999) or in stable BHK expression systems (Benharouga, M., and G.L. Lukacs, unpublished data). We proposed that, in contrast to the most prevalent CF-associated processing mutations (e.g., \u232c F508 CFTR), which compromise the biogenesis of CFTR, destabilization of the mature form at distal stages of the biosynthetic or endocytic pathway accounts for the phenotypic manifestation of truncated CFTR (Haardt et al., 1999) .",

BHK cells constitutively expressing wt or truncated CFTR were metabolically labeled with [ 35 S]methionine and [ 35 S]cysteine overnight and cell surface-exposed CFTR was covalently tagged with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin. After the solubilization and immunoprecipitation of CFTR, biotinylated polypeptides were isolated on Streptavidin-Sepharose and visualized by fluorography after separation by SDS-PAGE ( Fig. 1 A) . PhosphorImage analysis revealed that the abundance of biotinylated T70, T82, and T98 CFTR was only 5-8% relative to wt or T26 CFTR in the mixture of clones ( Fig. 1 B) . The steady state level of the complex-glycosylated T70, T82, and T98 CFTR pool was also diminished to 5-10% relative to that of wt or T26 CFTR, as determined by quantitative Western blotting using L12B4 or M3A7 anti-CFTR Abs (Fig. 1 , B and C). The complex and core-glycosylated forms of wt and truncated CFTR could be distinguished by their distinct electrophoretic mobility as well as their endoglycosidase H sensitivity as described previously and shown on Fig. 1 , C and D (Cheng et al., 1990) . The parallel decrease in the size of the complex-glycosylated and biotinylated pools of the truncated CFTR suggests that the plasma membrane targeting is largely preserved. To confirm this notion, the cell surface delivery of newly synthesized T70 CFTR was measured.",

Data represent means \u03ee SEM (n \u03ed 3), and are expressed as the percentage of the wt, designated as 100%. (C) Expression of wt, T26, T70, T82, and T98 CFTR in BHK-21 cells. CFTR expression in cell lysate was assessed by immunoblotting using the L12B4 and M3A7 anti-CFTR Abs. BHK lane contains a lysate of the parental cells. (D) Glycosidase sensitivity of complex-and core-glycosylated wt and T70 CFTR. Cell lysates were incubated in the presence or absence of endoglycosidase H (endo H) or peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) for 3 h at 37\u040aC. Polypeptides were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed by the L12B4 anti-CFTR Ab. Complex-, core-, and deglycosylated CFTR are indicated by black, white, and hatched arrowheads, respectively. (E) Targeting efficiency of newly synthesized CFTR to the cell surface. After the pulse labeling of wt or T70 CFTR for 20 min, plasma membrane insertion of the channels was determined by biotinylation during a 1-h chase at 37\u040aC using freshly dissolved sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (1 mg/ml) every 15 min. Biotinylated CFTR was precipitated with L12B4 and M3A7 Abs and then isolated on Streptavidin-Sepharose (biot). Labeled CFTR was visualized by fluorography. To monitor the pulse labeling of total CFTR pools, 10% of the precipitate was loaded directly (lysate).",

(A) After the pulse labeling of T70, T82, and T98 CFTR expressors, BHK cells were chased for 2 h to ensure the conversion of core-glycosylated form to complex-glycosylated CFTR at 37\u040aC. Subsequent chase was performed in the presence of NH 4 Cl (15 mM). Bafilomycin B (Baf B; 2 M) and leupeptin plus pepstatin A (leu\u03e9pep; 50 g/ml) were present during the entire pulse-chase. CFTR was immunoprecipitated and visualized by fluorography. (B) The radioactivity remaining in the complex-glycosylated T70, T82, and T98 CFTR after the chase was quantified by PhosphorImage analysis in experiments shown in A and expressed as the percentage of the initial amount present after 2 h of chase.

Equal amounts of protein were probed by immunoblotting as described in the legend to observed when lactacystin was added after the pulse labeling (Fig. 4 C) or after a 2-h chase (Fig. 4 D) . This latter protocol has ensured that augmented conversion of the core-to the complex-glycosylated form was not attributable to the lactacystin effect. Similarly, preventing ER to Golgi complex transport of the residual core-glycosylated T70 CFTR with brefeldin A (BFA) failed to influence the inhibitory effect of lactacystin (Fig. 4 D) , substantiating the notion that disposal of the complex-glycosylated mutants is delayed, rather than that the escape of core-glycosylated form is facilitated, by lactacystin. In fact, neither lactacystin nor MG 132 promoted the processing of the core-glycosylated T70 CFTR (Fig. 5 A) , similarly to other CFTR mutations identified in NBD1 (Jensen et al., 1995; Van Oene et al., 2000) .

The turnover of the folded core-glycosylated T70 CFTR was fourfold slower ( t 1/2 \u202b\u0641\u202c 7 h) than that of the complex-glycosylated T70 CFTR ( t 1/2 \u202b\u0641\u202c 1.8 h; Fig. 4 F) .

As we anticipated, proteasome inhibitors mitigated the disappearance of Tac-TCR\u2423, but not Tac-Lamp1, whereas bafilomycin B, but not the proteasome inhibitors, stabilized Tac-Lamp1 (Fig. 5, B and C) . Consistent with the notion that proteasome activity accounts, at least in part, for the proteolysis of the complexglycosylated truncated CFTR, proteasome inhibitors increased the steady state level of the complex-glycosylated T70, T82, and T98 CFTR by two-to fourfold according to densitometric analysis of immunoblots (Fig. 5 D) .

Organellar distribution was established by the activity of specific marker enzymes (plasma membrane, alkaline phosphatase [A P]; Golgi, mannosidase II [Mann II]; and lysosomes, \u2424-glucuronidase [\u2424-gluc]) as described previously . Enrichment of lysosomes in the high density fractions was confirmed by the accumulation of fluorescein-dextran (70 kD, 1.5 mg/ml) as well after an overnight labeling and a 3-h chase. (B) BHK cells expressing wt or T70 CFTR were treated with leupeptin and pepstatin A overnight (50 g/ml) and for 4 h (100 g/ml), respectively. Microsomes were isolated on Percoll density gradient, and fractions 5-13 and 15-18, comprising the majority of lysosomes and plasma membrane, Golgi regions, and endosomes, respectively, were pooled. Equal amounts (50 g) of protein were loaded and probed with NBD1 (L12B4) and NBD2 (M3A7) specific anti-CFTR Abs using ECL. directly or indirectly, are involved in the proteolysis of complex-glycosylated T70 CFTR from the cell surface and endosomal compartments (Fig. 6, C and D) .",

COS-1 cells were transiently cotransfected with plasmids encoding for the wt or T70 CFTR and HA-tagged ubiquitin (HA-Ub). HA-Ub was detected with the monoclonal anti-HA Ab in immunoprecipitated T70 CFTR. The abundance of high molecular weight immunoreactive polypeptides was augmented by lactacystin and MG132, suggesting that proteasome activity is involved in the degradation of polyubiquitinated The complex-glycosylated truncated CFTR is stabilized by proteasome inhibitors. BHK cells expressing T70, T82, and T98 CFTR were metabolically labeled and chased in the presence of lactacystin (Lac; 10 M) or MG132 (MG; 10 M). The stability of the complex-glycosylated form was monitored by immunoprecipitation and fluorography. The radioactivity remaining in the complex-glycosylated CFTR was measured by Phosphor-Image analysis and expressed as the percentage of the amount after a 2-h chase (B). Data are means \u03ee SEM, n \u03ed 3-4. (C and D) To rule out that lactacystin (10 M) delays the degradation of the complex-glycosylated form by promoting the biosynthesis or the conversion of the core-glycosylated form, cells were treated with lactacystin after the pulse labeling (C) or after the conversion of the core-to complex-glycosylated T70 (D). This protocol provided similar inhibition of the complex-glycosylated turnover as reported for A. When indicated, BFA (5 g/ ml) was included to prevent the conversion of the residual core-glycosylated form (D and E). (E-G) Comparison of the turnover rate of folded wt and T70 CFTR in the ER and post-Golgi compartments. After the pulse labeling of BHK transfectants, the fully mature core-glycosylated T70 and wt CFTR were accumulated in the ER by BFA (5 g/ml) during a 2-h chase. The disappearance of the folded core-glycosylated form was monitored during a subsequent 15-h chase in the presence of BFA and was expressed as the percentage of the amount detected after a 2-h chase (F and G). The stability of the complexglycosylated T70 and wt CFTR, representing post-Golgi pools, was determined as described for A. T70 CFTR (Fig. 7 A, top, lanes 8-10) . Similar results were obtained by monitoring the conjugation of endogenous Ub with a monoclonal anti-Ub Ab (Fig. 7 A, middle, lanes  6-10) . Ubiquitinated T70 CFTR could not be detected in cells expressing T70 CFTR or HA-Ub individually (Fig. 7  A, top, lanes 3-7) or after mock transfection (Fig. 7 A,  lanes 1-3) , validating the specificity of the assay. To discriminate whether polyubiquitinated T70 CFTR was derived from the core-and/or the complex-glycosylated T70 CFTR (Jensen et al., 1995; Ward et al., 1995; Xiong et al., 1999) , double immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled T70 CFTR was performed.",

In a second set of samples, separation of ubiquitinated adducts was achieved by sequential immunoprecipitation with anti-CFTR and then with anti-Ub Ab. The results show that a negligible amount of polyubiquitinated and core-glycosylated T70 CFTR persisted after the initial 2-h chase (Fig. 7  B, top and bottom, lanes 1 and 2) . In contrast, radioactivity appeared in the high molecular weight, polyubiquitinated T70 CFTR when MG132 was present during the last 2 h of chase (Fig. 7 B, top, lane 4) . Accumulation of polyubiquitinated T70 CFTR was more pronounced in COS-1 cells transiently coexpressing T70 CFTR and HA-Ub (Fig.  7 C) . This is most likely due to the higher immunoprecipitation efficiency of the anti-HA Ab. Ubiquitinated conjugates were not detectable upon inhibition of lysosomal proteolysis, or in mock transfected cells (Fig. 7 B , top and middle, and C). Considering that the turnover of the complex-glycosylated, but not the core-glycosylated T70 CFTR, is sensitive to proteasome inhibitors and the core- Equal amounts of whole cell lysate, obtained from cells exposed to lactacystin (Lac; 10 M) and MG132 (10 M) for 3 h, were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the L12B4 anti-CFTR Ab. Complex-and core-glycosylated CFTR are indicated by black and white arrowheads, respectively. (E) Functional rescue of T70 CFTR by lactacystin. The cAMP-activated halide conductance of T70 CFTRexpressing BHK cells was measured by the iodide efflux assay in the absence (control) or presence of lactacystin treatment ( \u03e9Lac; 10 M for 3 h). Data points are averages of triplicate determinations and show the difference of iodide release in the presence and absence of the protein kinase A agonist cocktail (10 M forskolin, 0.5 mM dibutyryl-cAMP, and 0.2 mM IBMX), added as indicated. glycosylated form has been largely eliminated before proteasome inhibition, we conclude that at least a fraction of polyubiquitinated T70 CFTR originates from the complex-glycosylated T70 CFTR. Although we cannot rule out that a small amount of polyubiquitinated T70 CFTR is derived from the core-glycosylated form, the following observations substantiate the notion that the complex-glycosylated T70 CFTR can form ubiquitinated adducts. Ubiquitinated complex-glycosylated form was visualized by anti-Ub Abs after the separation of the core-and complex-glycosylated forms by immunoprecipitation with anti-CFTR Abs and wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatography (data not shown). Furthermore, coexpression of the dominant negative K48RUb with T70 CFTR delayed the disposal of the complex-glycosylated mutant CFTR (data not shown).",

Intact microsomes were isolated by differential centrifugation from BHK cells, enriched in the complex-glycosylated wt or T70 CFTR by cyclohexamide chase, and subjected to limited proteolysis in the presence of an increasing concentration of trypsin. Immunoblot analysis of the proteolytic fragments with the L12B4 anti-CFTR Ab recognizing the NBD1 demonstrates a distinct proteolytic digestion pattern and a moderate, but reproducibly increased protease sensitivity of the complex-glycosylated T70 CFTR compared with wt CFTR (Fig. 8) . Similar results were obtained with proteinase K and using the NBD2-specific, M3A7 anti-CFTR Ab (data not shown), indicating that not only the NBD2, but also the NBD1 conformation was altered upon truncating the COOH terminus.",

A post-ER quality control mechanism appears to be responsible for targeting and vacuolar degradation of mutant plasma membrane ATPase, the late Golgi protease Kex2, and a model protein, comprising the secretory invertase and the NH 2 terminus of the lambda repressor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Wilcox et al., 1992; Chang and Fink, 1995; Hong et al., 1996) . Aggregation of unoccupied class II major histocompatibility complex molecules and cross-linking of cell surface membrane proteins, such as the transferrin receptor, can evoke preferential lysosomal targeting and degradation (Weissman et al., 1986; Amigorena et al., 1995) . Although most of these examples illustrate that nonnative membrane protein is targeted for lysosomal proteolysis either before their arrival to the cell surface or after their internalization, the complex-glycosylated truncated CFTR has a distinct intracellular fate. We presented compelling evidence indicating that the dramatically decreased expression level and residence time of the complex-glycosylated truncated CFTR cannot be attributed to missorting for lysosomal degradation at the trans-Golgi or endosomal compartment. Instead, the truncated CFTR is targeted to the plasma membrane with comparable efficiency to its wt counterpart (Fig. 1) . The turnover of the total and cell surface biotinylated T70 CFTR pools was insensitive to inhibitors of endolysosomal proteases. In contrast, weak bases and cathepsin inhibitors stabilized the full-length form and degradation intermediates of wt CFTR in transfected cells as well as in epithelia, highlighting the multiple role of endolysosomal proteolysis in the turnover of wt CFTR (Figs. 2 and 3) .",

First, the degradation rates of the complexglycosylated T70, 82, and 98 CFTR were delayed in the presence of lactacystin, the most specific inhibitor of proteasome (Fenteany et al., 1995; Fig. 4 ). Second, a dramatic extension of the plasma membrane residence time of biotinylated T70 CFTR was evoked by lactacystin (Fig. 6) , implying that proteasomes are indispensable in the proteolysis of the truncated CFTR from the cell surface and/or endosomal compartment. Since proteasome inhibitors had no impact on the degradation of Tac-Lamp1, an indirect effect of lactacystin on lysosomal proteolysis could be precluded (Fig. 5) . Third, MG132 and lactacystin evoked the accumulation of polyubiqutinated adducts of the complexglycosylated T70 CFTR, consistent with the notion that a fraction of the T70 CFTR is tagged by polyubiquitin chain(s) before degradation (Fig. 7) . Finally, both MG132 and lactacystin partially restored the expression level of complex-glycosylated T70, T82, and T98 CFTR, as well as the plasma membrane cAMP-activated chloride conductance of T70 CFTR transfectants without facilitating the biogenesis of the mutants (Fig. 5, D and E) . Although these observations indicate that proteasome activity is one of the rate-limiting steps for the turnover of the full-length complex-glycosylated T70 CFTR, proteasome inhibitors failed to restore the mutant stability to that of the wt Figure 8 .

Deletion of the COOH terminus, comprising a postsynaptic density-95, disc-large, and zonula occludens-1-binding motif ( 1476 DTRL) that ensures the association of CFTR with EBP-50 (for ezrin-radixin-moesinbinding phosphoprotein 50) both in vitro and in vivo may facilitate lysosomal degradation by compromising endosomal sorting for recycling (Hall et al., 1998; Short et al., 1998; Moyer et al., 2000) . A similar paradigm was proposed for the accelerated degradation of the \u2424 2 -adrenergic receptor upon preventing its binding to EBP-50 (Cao et al., 1999) . However, this possibility appears to be unlikely, since the steady state expression level and turnover rate of a CFTR variant lacking the COOH-terminal 26 amino acid residues are normal (Mickle et al., 1998; Haardt et al., 1999) . Neither can aggregation of T70 CFTR at the trans-Golgi or at early endosomes target the mutant for lysosomal degradation. Finally, the absence of the COOH-terminal tail may structurally destabilize the folded CFTR, increasing the portion of nonnative molecules that are susceptible to proteolysis.",

Based on the enhanced protease susceptibility and the decreased in vivo thermostability of T70 CFTR (Figs. 8 and 9), we speculate that structural destabilization of the native form is induced by disrupting interaction(s) of the COOH terminus. Using various yeast screening assays and site-directed mutagenesis of the Deg-1 proteolytic motif in the MAT\u24232 transcription factor, it has been established that ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (Ubc6 and Ubc7) can recognize hydrophobic stretches and exposed hydrophobic surfaces on amphipathic helices (Sadis et al., 1995; Gilon et al., 1998; Johnson et al., 1998) . These or similar motifs, normally buried inside the globular domains of CFTR or inserted into the membrane plane, may serve as recognition signal(s). In support of this notion, the decreased plasma membrane residence time and impaired expression level of the \u2424 2 -and the \u2423 2A -adrenergic receptors were also attributed to structural destabilization (Gether et al., 1997; Wilson and Limbird, 2000) . However, the mechanism responsible for the downregulation of these G protein-coupled receptors, which could be partially rescued with ligand stabilization, has remained obscure.",

Ubiquitination also ap-pears to be necessary and sufficient to induce the internalization and downregulation of plasma membrane receptors and transporters (e.g., FUR4, GAP1, STE2, STE3, and STE6) via vacuolar proteolysis in yeast (Hicke, 1999) . The constitutive downregulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), in association with the Nedd4 ubiquitinligase, was proposed to follow a similar degradation route, in contrast to the unassembled subunits of the channel, which were degraded by a proteasome-dependent mechanism at the ER (Staub et al., 1997) .",

Consistent with the dispensable nature of ubiquitination, downregulation of the \u2424 2 -adrenergic and mutant m2-muscarinic receptors can proceed without endocytosis, presumably by direct association with proteasome and/or other, presently unidentified proteases (Jockers et al., 1999; Wilson and Limbird, 2000) .

Degradation appears to be initiated by the unfolding of cytosolic domains in a proteasome-dependent manner. The biochemical as well as functional rescue of cell surface resident T70, but not wt CFTR (data not shown), by proteasome inhibitors substantiate this hypothesis. Whereas the initial cleavage of the mature wt CFTR, as opposed to mutant, relies on the activity of lysosmal proteases, subsequent degradation of wt and T70 CFTR converges in endolysosomes, demonstrated by their overlapping proteolytic fragmentation pattern in the presence of cathepsin inhibitors (Fig. 3 B) .",
