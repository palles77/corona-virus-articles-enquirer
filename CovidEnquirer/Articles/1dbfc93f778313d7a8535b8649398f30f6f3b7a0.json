Data were also collected for the same time period of 2013 and 2012. Respiratory specimens from severely ill patients nationwide, who were rhinovirus-positive or enterovirus-positive in hospital testing, were submitted between Aug 1, and Oct 31, 2014, and typed by molecular sequencing. We collected basic clinical and epidemiological characteristics of EV-D68 cases with a standard data collection form submitted with each specimen. We compared patients requiring intensive care with those who did not, and patients requiring ventilator support with those who did not. Mantel-Haenszel \u03c7\u00b2 tests were used to test for statistical signifi cance. Findings Regional and hospital-level data from Missouri, Illinois, and Colorado showed increases in respiratory illness between August and September, 2014, compared with in 2013 and 2012. Nationwide, 699 (46%) of 1529 patients tested were confi rmed as EV-D68. Among the 614 EV-D68-positive patients admitted to hospital, age ranged from 3 days to 92 years (median 5 years). Common symptoms included dyspnoea (n=513 [84%]), cough (n=500 [81%]), and wheezing (n=427 [70%]); 294 (48%) patients had fever. 338 [59%] of 574 were admitted to intensive care units, and 145 (28%) of 511 received ventilator support; 322 (52%) of 614 had a history of asthma or reactive airway disease; 200 (66%) of 304 patients with a history of asthma or reactive airway disease required intensive care compared with 138 (51%) of 270 with no history of asthma or reactive airway disease (p=0\u00b70004). Similarly, 89 (32%) of 276 patients with a history of asthma or reactive airway disease required ventilator support compared with 56 (24%) of 235 patients with no history of asthma or reactive airway disease (p=0\u00b7039). Interpretation In 2014, EV-D68 caused widespread severe respiratory illness across the USA, disproportionately aff ecting those with asthma. This unexpected event underscores the need for robust surveillance of enterovirus types, enabling improved understanding of virus circulation and disease burden. Funding None.

During 1987-2005, 26 sporadic cases of EV-D68 were reported to NESS. 3 Reporting subsequently increased, with 94 reports during 2006-13; a peak of 50 reports in 2009 coincided with small clusters of EV-D68 associated with acute respiratory illness. 4 Many small, localised clusters of EV-D68 were reported before 2014 in the USA 4-6 and worldwide. 4, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Most clusters have included fewer than 30 cases and, as such, epidemiological and clinical descriptions of the virus have been limited; one of the largest reported outbreaks was in Japan in 2010, where more than 120 cases were detected. 4 Circulating strains of EV-D68 are genetically diverse and seem to be distributed globally. 13 Correspondence to: Dr Claire M On Aug 19, 2014, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was notifi ed by investigators at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, MO, USA, (CMH-Kansas City-MO) of an increase in patients with severe respiratory illness requiring intensive care. An increase was also noted in detections of rhinovirus or enterovirus by a multiplex PCR assay in nasopharyngeal specimens obtained during Aug 5-19. On Aug 23 and 29, CDC was notifi ed of similar increases in children's hospitals in Chicago, IL, and Aurora, CO, respectively. Sequencing of specimens from selected cases of severe respiratory illness from Kansas City and Chicago identifi ed EV-D68 as the predominant pathogen. 15 In response to these fi ndings, we launched a broader nationwide investigation to further describe the clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory features of this outbreak, and to better understand the role of EV-D68 in severe respiratory illness.",

            "text": "Beginning in August, 2014, reports of severe respiratory illness predominantly aff ecting children increased compared with previous years, resulting in a substantial burden of hospital admissions. Between August and October, almost half of the respiratory specimens sequenced from patients already known to be enteroviruspositive or rhinovirus-positive were identifi ed as EV-D68. This outbreak is the largest and most widespread outbreak of EV-D68 reported to date. Among a select number of patients with available clinical data, illness was indicative of a non-specifi c respiratory disease, often in the absence of fever, indistinguishable from asthma exacerbation related to other causes. Most patients required intensive care. Half of the patients had a history of asthma or reactive airway disease, and these individuals were more likely to require intensive care or ventilator support. Between Aug 1, and Oct 31, 2014, 927 EV-D68 cases were detected across the USA. These cases are a substantial underestimate of the true count, because only a selection of patients with severe illness was tested. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the EV-D68 viruses circulating at that time were from two lineages, both of which were detected across the USA, suggesting that this outbreak was widespread and not likely to be a series of smaller localised clusters. The reason for the widespread circulation of EV-D68 in 2014 is unknown. Generally, enteroviruses are considered ubiquitous in the community, but with unpredictable annual variations in circulation and outbreak patterns. 3 EV-D68 strains identifi ed during this outbreak are very similar to those detected sporadically over the past few years in the USA and elsewhere, indicating that the 2014 EV-D68 outbreak is unlikely to be the result of a novel virus strain. More detailed phylogenetic analyses of EV-D68 strains are ongoing. Testing practices probably played a part in increased detection and case ascertainment. Historically, EV-D68 typing by either neutralisation or molecular sequencing has been done by only a few specialised laboratories, restricting the number of cases identifi ed. Recent introduction of multipathogen PCR panels in many large hospitals, however, has greatly expanded the detection of enteroviruses generically, especially in respiratory illness in which enteroviruses were not previously routinely considered. This has indirectly contributed to the recent increase in reporting. The substantial rise in respiratory illness detected by syndromic surveillance, however, suggests that increased testing is unlikely to be the only contributor. Studies from across the world that have retrospectively typed stored specimens suggest that EV-D68 circulation has been present at low levels in recent years. 8, 10, 12, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] The spectrum of respiratory illness caused by EV-D68 is not well defi ned. Because of the sudden increase in reports of severe respiratory illness, our investigation focused primarily on further describing this entity. However, existing syndromic surveillance detected increases in both inpatient and outpatient respiratory illness during the outbreak period in the three states investigated. This highlights the importance of such systems in characterizing outbreaks. For the detection of EV-D68 going forward, afebrile presentations should be considered in the design of such systems, because many aim to detect infl uenza-like illness and include fever as a detection criterion. The full scope of EV-D68 circulation, both geographical and temporal, remains unknown. Enterovirus season in temperate climates is typically summer and autumn, but some cases can occur into the winter. 3 Because of few data, EV-D68 seasonality is not well characterised. Most EV-D68 cases reported have fallen within this typical enterovirus season, 4,6,10,12 although cases have been detected at other times of year. 3, 7, 9 Although most EV-D68 reports so far have been in association with respiratory illness, the full spectrum of disease is unknown. As examples, EV-D68 was detected in the cerebrospinal fl uid of a patient with acute fl accid paralysis in the USA in 2005, 3 and in one fatal case involving complications of the nervous system in the USA in 2008. 27 Additionally, in a similar timeframe with the increase in respiratory illness described in our investigation, there was an increase of acute fl accid myelitis in children across the USA. 18, 28, 29 EV-D68 was detected in respiratory specimens of some of these individuals but no virus, including EV-D68, was detected in the cerebrospinal fl uid. As such, the contribution of EV-D68 to this neurological illness is not clear and the cause of acute fl accid myelitis is still being elucidated.",

In view that the prevalence of asthma in the USA was 8\u00b74% in 2010, 31 our data suggest that this is a possible risk factor for admission to hospital with EV-D68.

Additionally, the increases noted in these data in 2014 compared with 2013 and 2012 might have been infl uenced by increased media and public awareness during a nationwide outbreak. Although emergency department visits might be aff ected by this attention, we would not expect a substantial eff ect on patients admitted to hospital. Due to the regional syndromic data being reported in aggregate, we were also not able to directly compare these fi ndings to the patient-level data received. During this investigation, specimen collection and testing focused on severely ill patients and therefore we were unable to describe the full severity spectrum of respiratory illness. The criteria for specimen submission was not standardised and might not be representative of all those admitted to hospital and, furthermore, collection priorities changed among the states through the course of the investigation. Additionally, data completeness was not uniform and some variables, such as race, ethnicity, and detections of other pathogens, were less well reported. For the latter, testing algorithms were not standardised and probably varied among hospitals and providers across the country. An age-specifi c selection bias might have also been introduced in that most reporting facilities were children's hospitals. Samples from adults were sought and tested, but awareness might have been increased in the paediatric settings. Previous reports would suggest that a higher number of adult cases might have been expected, 3, 4, 12 although these studies were not focused on severe disease. Paediatric intensive care unit admission criteria might have varied across the country, possibly introducing a misclassifi cation of severity in our comparative analysis; however, our results are strengthened by the consistent observation of the eff ect of asthma or reactive airway disease noted by use of two severity methods.",
