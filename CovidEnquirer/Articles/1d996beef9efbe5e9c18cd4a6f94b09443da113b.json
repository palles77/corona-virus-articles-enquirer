For the next 60 years, the allergy world converged at the IAACI triennial meetings, which became biennial in 2003. The international meetings, originally named the International Congress of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (ICACI), are now the World Allergy Congress (WAC) hosted by the World Allergy Organization (WAO). Everyone who has aspired to have worldwide recognition has played a part in IAACI-WAO. The History of the World Allergy Organization traces the global arc of the allergy field over the past 60 years. The current officers of WAO elected to focus on this rich history, inviting prominent leaders who are interested in being part of this history project to write about their time with IAACI-WAO. This series will be presented in Canc\u00fan, M\u00e9xico as part of the XXII World Allergy Congress (December [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] 2011) . Leading up to the Congress in Canc\u00fan, the World Allergy Organization Journal is presenting segments of the History as part of the \"Notes of Allergy Watchers Series.\" Please enjoy.",

Both the American College of Allergy Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) with Gil Barkin as President and the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) with Leonard Bernstein as President were invited by IAACI to help organize the congress. This meeting was held on American soil in cooperation with the 2 allergy societies in the United States. However, the functional direction of the meeting was controlled by Alain deWeck with the assistance of Robert Goldstein, who was Chief of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases extramural program, responsible for administrating research grants and other extramural activities and who functionally acted as a Co-Chair of the meeting. Allen Kaplan, who had recently left the National Institutes of Health for Stoneybrook, was the scientific advisor, and I was asked to provide general support while specifically running the social program.",

We had inhaled cromoglycate for asthma, a novel medication that had focused attention on the role of the mast cell and allergy in the pathogenesis of asthma. And, the first nonsedating antihistamines were just appearing. As the Social Program Chairman of the 1985 meeting, I was able to raise funds and hold spectacular events, such as the All-Congress event held at the Smithsonian's American History Museum, which we rented for an evening. It was a splendid setting. We had the President's Reception in the Corcoran Museum. The entire congress went to the Kennedy Center for a performance. But the highlight of the meeting was the barbeque on the National Mall. Marion-Merrell-Dow, now Sanofi-Aventis, wanted to bring Seldane, the first nonsedating H1 antihistamine, out at the meeting, and they wanted a big splash. Well, we had one. We rented the space on the National Mall just north of the Air and Space Museum, a spot now housing the National Museum of the American Indian, and rented the largest tent you can imagine. Unfortunately, it rained all week, and so you could actually splash at the event! This event is the single most memorable dinner I have attended at any meeting anywhere (and after 40 years, that includes a whole heck of a lot of meetings). The 2500 attendees were wined, dined, squaredanced, and thrilled. Seldane went on to sell $billions before being replaced by Allegra.",

As a federation of allergy and immunology societies, charging more than a modicum for dues was not feasible, so income from the triennial congresses determined what might be accomplished over the subsequent 3 years. Board meetings were generally only held annually, and scant communications occurred between meetings. There were no conference calls of the Board, so that the only communication occurred by mail, very little by e-mail, and mostly by face-to-face communication once a year.",

Meeting sites were selected 6 years earlier at the triennial meeting of the House of Delegates, which is a meeting where representatives from all the member societies meet and vote on some issues of worldwide interest, such as the meeting venue. Voting in the House of Delegates was proportional to the size of membership of the society, although the smallest society (at least 30 members) had at least 1 vote, while the larger societies like the Japanese Society had 3 votes.",

It was never clear how one was selected to move from an at-large member into an officer position or how an officer was then selected to become the president. At-large membership selection for the Board of Directors was also a bit of a mystery. The past president nominated new members largely in consultation with a nominating committee composed of well-known allergists who had never served on the IAACI Board. Newly appointed members could be recycled from retiring current Board members, who might thereby spend extended periods on the Board while never becoming the president. The concept of limiting the time as a member of the Board was not considered at that time. During my early years, the core of the Board was always European, with some Eastern representation (always at least 1 person from Japan and often Australia); there was always at least 1 person from Latin America and 1 to 2 from America. The United States presented a conundrum. It was traditional to have a representative of both the ACAAI and AAAAI on the Board, but in the mid-1990s, in a rather xenophobic moment, the ACAAI decided to withdraw from the IAACI, changing their minds a few years later and reapplying for membership back into the IAACI. During that period of disengagement, no ACAAI representatives were appointed to the Board, so the AAAAI was the sole source of nominees from America.",

Allen Kaplan in his memoirs for the WAO history project described this period of IAACI as an \"Old Boy's Club,\" and I agree with that characterization. Giving credit to where it belongs, Alain deWeck recognized the dilemma and held a retreat at the Meadowood Resort in Napa Valley after the AAAAI Annual Meeting in San Francisco in 1997, to discuss the future of IAACI. After that meeting, in large part in response to the renomination of several retiring members of the \"Old Boy's Club\" back onto the Board for recycling, a controversial letter written by myself was sent to the Board calling for sweeping changes. For several months after that meeting and the subsequent provocative letter, there were heated, passionate debates over the need to modernize and democratize; and in fact, several Board members eventually resigned and a new, younger Board was brought into place. The slate of officers of IAACI was shuffled a bit, and I recall some hard feelings around the Board table. At that moment, I became a persona non grata and was demoted to Second Vice President, entering the proverbial doghouse.",

Gunnar Johansson understood the issues, as did Rick Iber of Executive Director Incorporated (EDI) (the WAO Secretariat housed in Milwaukee). Rick and I had worked on the post-Meadowood provocative letter together, recognizing that it was certain to cause an upheaval. When Gunnar Johansson became President, he called for a retreat to be held at a seaside venue in Sweden in 1998. Rick Iber's partner in EDI was Kay Whalen, now the President of EDI, which is still the WAO Secretariat, and one of the true assets of WAO. With the help of Rick and Kay, a facilitator was hired who presided over the meeting, leading to progressive discussions and a revolutionary, unifying and exhilarating new direction for the old IAACI. Attending this session were the members of the Board, which had become decidedly younger after the 1997 upheaval. In a brilliant 2day session, we decided to focus IAACI as a global federation of allergy societies, changing our name to the World Allergy Organization (WAO). It was universally felt that WAO should be much more than the host of a triennial meeting, and objectives for education, research, and training were identified.",

The bylaws were laboriously redesigned (a continual activity) under the guidance of Richard Lockey and have continued to evolve thereafter. The length of time one can serve as a member of the Board was defined, leading to the opportunity for more countries to be represented on the Board. WAO has emerged as a democratic organization, with representatives chosen in equal distribution from a worldwide pool, with consideration for the need to represent small and large allergy societies. The method for electing officers and their progress through the various elected positions was defined, and democratic transparent elections both to become a member of the Board and to become an officer became the mode. Rotation of the biannual meeting around the globe assured the opportunity for all interested societies to host this important meeting. Recent meetings have taken place in Australia, Canada, Mexico, Sweden, Thailand, Germany, and Argentina. We soon shall return to Mexico, go to Italy and Korea, and perhaps the United States.",

The budget for expenses during the year the congress takes place was in the order of $3,000,000. This imbalance between budget and income was dangerously out of balance, as any untoward event could lead to bankruptcy. After a long and arduous debate, first in the Board of Directors and then at the House of Delegates, it was agreed to increase the dues to 5 Swiss francs per member. Anyone reading this document will recognize that this is still a paltry amount, but the painful discussion leading to this increase in dues remains vividly in my memory, as it underlines some of the major perplexing issues any international society faces as it grows.",

There were a flurry of notes, some condemnations, and a few approvals. However, several established Board members elected not to continue past 1997, and the opportunity to revitalize the Board ensued. The period between March 1997 and the congress in Cancun later that year was full of behind-the-scenes discussions and decisions. I recall one well-respected Board member stating that he preferred to have older, more mature Board members because they had already fulfilled their ambitions. While this position has merit, the need to make IAACI more democratic, with a broader world representation and a more involved and vital leadership outweighed this argument. I believe that the 1997 letter actually precipitated the events that occurred in 1998 that have revitalized WAO. Rereading it 15 years later, I recognize that the impudence and emotion that led to that letter were well-meaning and effective, but this was an incredible bomb to lob into the laps of a staid and reserved group of otherwise well-meaning allergy leaders.

If you review the history of IAACI written by Alain deWeck as part of this project, you will see that the basic immunologists had already removed themselves from IAACI, and clinical immunology had become integrated into many organ-based specialties. Thus, it was more a recognition that WAO represented allergy as its core constituency and that clinical immunology was part of WAO much as it is part of dermatology, rheumatology, nephrology, transplantation, and the like.

To better arm our constituents to teach allergy to others, GLORIA would include a lecture (for example on allergic rhinitis) at a national allergy meeting, then the speaker would meet with the local allergists, review the slides, and provide them with copies of the slides that they could use to give subsequent lectures either to allergists or family doctors.

The first event was held in Sydney, Australia, during the XVII International Congress of Allergy Asthma and Immunology in Sydney in October 2000. The timing was to be determined by each allergy society, using the timing that worked best for each geographical region. Working with the WHO turned out to be problematic, and without going into detail, did not develop. The idea of a World Allergy Day continued for the last decade, with no generally agreed upon plan. Individually, countries sporadically developed their own plans in association with the WAO initiative, with some degree of local success. In 2010, the WAO Communications Council, with Marek Kowalski as Chair, proposed to the Board the concept of World Allergy Week, to be held at the same time each year and independent of any congresses (Fig. 6) . I have high hopes that the new plan will be more successful at a global level.",

I had been Treasurer for 6 years and certainly knew our financial status, but as mentioned earlier, we were in a bit of a tough time, and I wanted to give an accurate report, not an estimate; and those numbers just were not available. So, for the first time in my professional life, I was forced to report to my peers that I could not give a report, but that as soon as numbers became available, we would share them with the member societies. As it turns out, we were financially secure, with enough revenue from a number of our outreach programs that we were solvent and have remained so ever since. But, I would rate this moment in my memory as my low point professionally. This disarray at the end of Gunnar Johansson's term as the president was unfortunate, but we soon recovered.

The first ESP took place in Seoul, South Korea, in conjunction with the annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Allergy Asthma and Clinical Immunology (APAACI) meeting in 2002.

Richard Lockey enlisted the support of a committed group of editors who have donated their time to translate the electronic newsletters into 8 or more languages.

Both of these initiatives were successful, but it was clear that at this point, WAO was probably not the right body to administer and supervise research funding. Both of these funding ideas have merit and are needed by the community, but there was no continuity of funding, the Board turned over too quickly, and the WAO Secretariat required a lot of time to supervise recipients and sponsors. Thus, while in the best of worlds, WAO would like to offer research funding, in the real world, our experience was that other organizations can do this sort of initiative far better than WAO.

Markedly increased overview was imposed on the pharmaceutical industry by programs of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that were created to be restrictive rather than supportive. Congressional interest in medical education led by Iowa's Senator Grassely focused on apparent excessive \"giveaways,\" but overlooked the important education provided by the industry to physicians. The influence of these oversight initiatives generated extreme caution by the pharmaceutical companies and led to a significant and rapid reduction in educational funding. Programs such as GLORIA and many pharmaceutical-sponsored education programs at national meetings, including the WAC, were curtailed. This reduction in sponsoring medical education is the classic example of cutting off one's nose to spite the face. Everyone has suffered. There is far less education available to the physician, and no funds are available for patient education. Physicians can no longer attend sponsored CME meetings where a general topic can be addressed (such as asthma or anaphylaxis), as the industry will now only sponsor promotional talks, which require the use of internally approved slides and a restricted discussion of an FDA-approved product kept within the package insert. I believe that within a few years, pharmaceutical companies will once again realize that education of physicians about best practices is by far the most efficient way to introduce a product into a prescribing physician's treatment plans. I wonder if the FDA and its European counterpart will have the insight to create room for educational programs that are more useful than the current promotional talks. I have no hope that Senator Grassley will ever see how his pressure on the US Congress and FDA has hurt the very industry he has tried to support, but senators come and go, so his time will end eventually.",

This council took several actions of critical long-term consequence. Starting in 1995 and continuing through to the current council, this group has created several WAO position papers designed to define the specialty, the training required to adequately care for patients with allergic and immunologic disease, and the need for to train adequate numbers of allergists to provide care for the hundreds of millions of allergy sufferers.",

However, there was no air-conditioning, and I recall presenting a very special award to Barry Kay while drenched in sweat and not wearing either a coat or a tie. In Europe, such informality, especially in a royal palace, is unheard of! But, boy was it HOT! The highlight of the meeting was the opera created by Johannes Ring. He had served long and well on the WAO Board. He was a Vice President, became the founding editor of the newly launched World Allergy Organization Journal, and was the Chair of the annual meeting in 2005 from the German Society for Allergology and Clinical Immunology. Johannes Ring is the rarely encountered \"renaissance\" man, an astute academician, allergist-dermatologist, historian, and semiprofessional composer of operas. I first knew of his talent at writing operas when 10 years earlier he had written an homage to Alain deWeck, performed on a bus while we drove through The Netherlands. The coup d'\u00e9tat in Munich was his opera on allergy based upon Dante's Inferno, written by Johannes Ring and performed by his professional colleagues in Munich. I treasure the recording of the performance and marvel at his talents and those of his colleagues. Of all of my memories of memorable moments in WAO history over the past 40 years, this one achieves a topmost tier.",

Traditionally, the WAO president's term ends after his congress and the new president assumes responsibility on the last day of the congress. I was to follow him as the next president and was looking forward to assuming the role. However, such was not to be the case. At the Board meeting in the spring of 2005 just prior to the Munich Congress, Richard Lockey ate lunch at a table apart from my own. Richard Lockey is a wonderful Board member, fully capable of making rapid and decisive decisions and knowledgeable about how Boards operate. Well, after this particular lunch, he immediately made a motion to have the tenure of the president run from January 1 of the year following our biennial Congress until December 31 of the next year. For me, it cut 6 months from my possible term of presidency to what is now the usual 2-year term as determined by the calendar rather than the dates of the congress. In every way, the decision to change the dates was correct, but I have made it a policy to eat lunch with Richard Lockey at every Board meeting since, just so I know what he might have up his sleeve.",

He represented us well and everywhere. As such, he became our diplomat and probably personally won us as many friends as could be achieved in a 2-year period. I have always recognized that Carlos Baena-Cagnani has more best friends than anyone I have ever met. He is welcome throughout the world because of his pleasant nature, charming personality, and personal energy. Let me share one anecdote about him: I arrived at a Board meeting having been able to upgrade to business class because I had some (very limited) status with this one airline. Lanny Rosenwasser flew on the same flight, but in first class, as he was a 100,000-mile traveler. While getting our luggage, Walter Canonica (who was President Elect at the time) arrived, and he related that he was a 100,000-mile traveler with 2 airline systems. Finally, Carlos Baena-Cagnani came sauntering over, having flown in the co-pilot's seat, stating that he had 100,000-mile status with 3 separate airline systems. My hat is off to him. I appreciate that he has earned the respect of allergists throughout the world and that WAO has benefited from his energy and willingness to be our world diplomat.",

WAO had several publications spanning a several decade period, but none had been consistently successful, either scientifically or financially. In every instance, WAO did not own the journal and had limited responsibility for the direction and financial issues related to these journals. Allergy and Clinical Immunology News, or ACIN (later Allergy and Clinical Immunology International) was developed by Alain deWeck, who was the initial editor. ACIN was designed to be a newsletter and was very readable and quite an enjoyable magazine, but it was not scientifically competitive. Attempts to get this journal into PubMed were unsuccessful. The journal eventually became the Journal of the World Allergy Organization, but this conversion was also scientifically unsuccessful. Over the years, WAO had worked closely with Hogrefe and Huber to develop a viable journal, but in the period from 2005 to 2006, after a series of long and difficult discussions, WAO decided to part from Hogrefe and Huber and establish its own journal. The concept of the new journal was electronic, with rapid publication, an excellent editorial board, a recognized publisher (Lippincott Williams & Wilkins), and to be provided free to the readership. The World Allergy Organization Journal has been promoted primarily through the WAO e-mail list and all WAO meetings and mailings. The first editor was Johannes Ring, and he has been succeeded by Lanny Rosenwasser. An initial attempt to get accepted by PubMed has not been successful but attempts are still proceeding. The first few years of the World Allergy Organization Journal have been promising, with some very good articlesdboth scientific reviews and innovative new sciencedbeing published.

The attendance was good (4200 attendees from nearly 100 countries), the meeting was profitable ($260,000), and both the social and scientific aspects were excellent. The meeting was developed following the principles of WAO interactions with its partners. The Asthma, Allergy and Immunology Society of Thailand, headed by Pakit Vichyanond, was involved in every decision and directed the social aspects of the meeting. Pakit Vichyanond was an excellent host who represented the Eastern world of allergy with grace and discretion. Pakit was a pleasure to work with, and he made certain that there was an excellent representation from Eastern speakers at the program. The scientific program committee was headed by him, Anthony Frew, and Lanny Rosenwasser, supported by Carlos Baena-Cagnani and Walter Canonica. There were joint sessions cohosted with AAAAI, ACAAI, and EAACI. These sessions were part of focused \"bookends\" to anchor both the first and last days of the meeting. There was an aggressive movement to showcase each member society by permitting \"sister society sessions\" where WAO Member Societies individually or in combinations of societies could sponsor a session, and about 20 such society-sponsored sessions took place at the meeting. There was a World Allergy Day held during the congress, and an opportunity for member societies to have an exhibit in the main portion of the registration area in a world allergy village format. In partnership with Schering, APAACI and EAACI, and a record number of travel grants were given to nearly 100 young allergists. As part of the program, training programs from around the world were given the opportunity to compete with one another in an ongoing \"Allergy Quiz,\" which ran throughout the entire meeting. Thus, the congress in Thailand was innovative, entertaining, and completely successful. As always, the science presented at the meeting was a leading edge, the Thai settings were stupendous, and the social program was memorable. I will always treasure the feeling of being brought into the opening ceremony on a palanquin carried by sturdy Thai men, led by beautiful Thai women. Then, Pakit Vichyanond and I struck a large gong to officially open the meeting (Fig. 12) . All in all, Thailand proved to be a most hospitable host, Pakit Vichyanond and the Asthma, Allergy and Immunology Society of Thailand were gracious partners, and those allergists who attended the meeting enjoyed themselves very well.",

This was the second meeting in Argentina; the first was held in 1979 and was a financial disaster. The second Buenos Aires meeting was quite successful, with more than 5000 attending, excellent science, and an altogether pleasant experience. Unfortunately, this meeting was also a financial disaster, with a net profit of less than $100,000. It is hard to explain the reasons why a wellattended meeting could be nonprofitable, and even from a clear retrospective analysis, it is still not clear what happened. Certainly, Argentina turned out to be quite expensive, the social programs were outstanding but were far too expensive, and the government taxed the revenue despite promises that they would not. The primary lesson learned was that WAO cannot allow meetings to proceed without ironclad control of all expenditures and total control of all the finances. Having said that, I believe that these lessons were learned and that they will be instituted henceforth. WAC 2009 in Buenos Aires was a lovely meeting and won WAO many worldwide admirers and supporters. ",

            "text": "Richard Lockey became president on January 1, 2010, recognizing that WAC 2009 in Buenos Aires had left him with markedly depleted funds for his 2-year term (Fig. 15) . He, and the Executive Committee, decided to move forward with an interim meeting late in 2010 focused on diseases, which overlap and influence the course of asthma. Dubai, United Arab Emirates, was the site, and the meeting was focused on the Middle East. About 1400 attended the meeting, which was run on a very tight budget and with adequate pharmaceutical support. The meeting was extremely successful from the scientific and financial aspects with a profit of more than $300,000. The credit for this successful meeting goes to Richard Lockey, Ruby Pawankar, and the rest of the Board of Directors. The drive, organizational skills, and foresight to create such a meeting define the type of leadership now in control of WAO. The organization is being run in an extremely transparent democratic fashion, with multiple Board members having responsibility for multiple aspects of the organization. When I think back 2 decades to the \"Old Boy's Club\" that existed until 2000, compared with the dynamic global structure currently in place, I feel extremely pleased that the world of allergy is being led by this organization. Richard Lockey joins the group of outstanding leaders who have left a permanent imprint on the organization. He has been the driving force behind the constitution and the Web site, and he has impacted WAO's finances repeatedly. He has insisted on a democratic structure, run with the highest standards of ethics, and has asked everyone to contribute their time and energy. He will have the chance to contribute his own chapter to this history, but my expectation is that he will be much too modest to describe his achievements in the terms I have chosen.",

All aspects of allergy are being explored, with research papers, position statements, congresses, lectures, webinars, and the like providing the world with great opportunities for education. The Web site continues to grow and strengthen under the leadership of Juan Carlos Ivancevich. The World Allergy Organization Journal is being run by Lanny Rosenasser with the assistance of a worldwide selection of allergy leaders. The WAC 2011 in Cancun is headed by Richard Lockey, but Thomas Casale is organizing the program. I see activity for WAO from many Europeans, Africans, Asians, North Americans, and Latin Americans. The diversity of those actively participating is exactly what we had in mind in 1998 when the IAACI retreat in Sweden took place. That such an exhilarating achievement has been created, has taken roots, and has developed in this decade of activity is breathtaking. From those of us who have been privileged to watch WAO develop, to those of you who will participate in an even stronger organization in the future, we all must recognize that the hundreds of millions of allergy and asthma sufferers are the real beneficiaries of this work. The medical specialty of allergy has been strengthened by WAO, but it is the patients who will benefit. Patients who already have access to well-trained specialists will find these physicians better trained and those patients whose access will be available only because WAO laid the groundwork for their physicians to receive training in allergy may not understand the role WAO played but will benefit by the availability of a specialist specifically trained to treat them. It is the commitment to global education, to convincing governments that allergy needs to be supported and fostered, and the seminal work of developing allergy societies that exemplifies what WAO has and will contribute to the world of allergy.",
