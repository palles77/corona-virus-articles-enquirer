Viral infections tend to affect the liver in particular, and because of their high affinity for the liver, a subgroup of viruses is termed hepatitis viruses. This group is covered in separate chapters of this book. Here, we summarize other viral infections that do not primarily target the liver but can cause viral hepatitis as part of a systemic infection or lead to hepatic complications under certain conditions, such as immunodeficiency. Of course, this chapter cannot replace a clinical textbook on viral infections but instead focuses on the hepatic aspects of viral infections.",

Travel-associated liver disease caused by exotic infections such as Ebola virus, Rift Valley fever, or Lassa fever has been reported sporadically in the literature but currently does not represent a frequent health problem. Of the identified causes, dengue is among the top three etiologic agents, and it accounts for approximately 6% of febrile illnesses in travelers. 2 Of note, although malaria is the leading cause of systemic febrile illness worldwide, travelers from every tropical or subtropical region except sub-Saharan Africa and Central America have confirmed or suspected dengue more frequently than malaria. Chikungunya is an emerging novel viral infection that has recently been reported in Asia and Africa to cause fever with prominent myalgia, arthralgia, and rash in increasing numbers of patients. 3 Viral hemorrhagic fevers share some epidemiologic and clinical features and cause rather similar liver pathology. Most viruses are transmitted via arthropod vectors. The various viruses cause damage to small vessels in multiple organs, which frequently leads to overt hemorrhage. The spectrum of diseases and their geographic distribution are listed in Table  34 -1. Much attention has been paid to abnormal liver function and altered hepatic pathology. Nevertheless, clinically significant liver disease and death from liver failure are rare complications except in patients with yellow fever.",

Usually, yellow fever initially appears as an acute, flulike illness of sudden onset with fever, myalgia, and headache that cannot easily be distinguished from other acute infections. 15 Between 48 and 72 hours after onset, serum aminotransferases start to rise, thus heralding the development of jaundice. The degree of liver abnormalities at this stage predicts the severity of liver disease later during the course of the illness. 16 Next, a period of remission lasting up to 48 hours may follow the initial infection. Patients with abortive infection recover at this stage, but approximately 15% of patients will enter the third stage of intoxication, which is characterized by the return of fever, prostration, and organ dysfunction leading to nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, jaundice, oliguria, and a hemorrhagic diathesis. Yellow fever differs from all other viral causes of hepatitis by the fact that serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels exceed those of alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Aminotransferase levels are proportional to the severity of disease. 16 Direct bilirubin levels range between 5 and 10 mg/ dl, with levels being higher in those with fatal infection than in recovering patients. The diagnosis of yellow fever is confirmed by the serologic demonstration of specific IgM by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or by isolation of the virus from blood. Liver biopsy is not recommended because of a high risk for hemorrhage.",

The midzone of the liver lobule is affected, with sparing of cells neighboring the central vein and portal tracts. 17 Very high viral loads have been detected in liver samples from patients who died, and viral antigen is located at the midzone of the hepatic lobule, thus indicating that this is the site of direct viral injury. 18 Liver injury is characterized by eosinophilic degeneration and the presence of Councilman bodies. Rarely, intranuclear inclusion bodies (Torres bodies) are present. Fatty changes may be prominent. In specimens from surviving patients, the liver shows ballooned hepatocytes and regenerative hyperplasia with multiple multinucleated hepatocytes and some portal inflammation consisting mainly outbreaks and cause acute infections. Three to 6 days after a mosquito bite the virus spreads via the bloodstream, and among the various organs it can be isolated frequently from liver samples, 5 where dengue viral antigens have been detected in Kupffer cells, sinusoidal endothelial cells, and hepatocytes. 6,7 Dengue virus infection usually causes a flulike illness with a rash-dengue fever. Hepatomegaly and elevated serum aminotransferases, which are usually mild, are common in dengue virus infections. 8,9 Clinically more severe diseases, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), can follow secondary infection with dengue virus of a different serotype, thus suggesting that immune responses generated during previous exposure to dengue viruses may enhance the damage triggered by secondary dengue infection. In DHF there are widespread petechial hemorrhages together with multiple organ damage; in DSS, which mostly affects children younger than 15 years, there is extensive capillary leakage and severe fluid depletion leading to hypovolemic shock. If untreated, mortality approaches 50%. In fatal cases of DHF the liver is enlarged, is pale as a result of steatosis, and shows multifocal hemorrhages. Microscopically, focal hepatocellular necrotic areas are seen, as well as coalescent perivenular and midzonal necrosis with Councilman bodies, but relatively little inflammatory cell infiltration. 10, 11 It is supposed that liver injury is mediated by dengue virus infection of hepatocytes and Kupffer cells, as in vitro infection of a human hepatoma cell line with dengue virus has been shown to induce apoptotic cell death. 12 Currently, a vaccine against dengue virus is not available, and treatment is supportive, with DSS requiring intensive care.

In addition, the antiviral drug ribavirin is effective against Lassa virus infection, but only if administered early in the course of illness. 32 A study from Sierra Leone in patients at high risk for mortality confirmed the efficacy of ribavirin in the treatment of Lassa fever: only 1 of 20 patients died if intravenous ribavirin administered over a period of 10 days had been started within the first 6 days after the onset of fever, whereas mortality was 26% in fortunately, CCHF develops in only one of five people infected. The disease has four stages: incubation, prehemorrhagic, hemorrhagic, and convalescence. Incubation takes 3 to 7 days, and then fever, headache, myalgia, and dizziness develop suddenly. Facial hyperemia, conjunctivitis, and occasionally diarrhea are also noted. This stage lasts 4 to 5 days. The hemorrhagic period is short (2 to 3 days). The most common bleeding sites are in the nose, the gastrointestinal tract, the genitourinary tract, and the respiratory tract. In survivors, the convalescence phase begins about 10 to 20 days after the onset of disease.

They are negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that are carried primarily in rodents, which shed the virus in their urine, saliva, and feces. The virus is inhaled by humans as aerosols from dried rodent excreta or, in unusual circumstances, is transmitted via rodent bites. 63 Hantaviruses exist in multiple serotypes worldwide, which differ in their virulence. Some are considered nonpathogenic, whereas certain isolates can produce two distinct severe syndromes in humans: Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, mostly caused by isolates in the Americas, and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, caused by isolates (Seoul virus, Dobrava virus, Puumala virus, Hantaan virus) in Europe and Asia. 64 In some instances, patients with Hantavirus hemorrhagic fever have suffered from severe acute hepatitis, whereas renal damage was rather mild. 65,66 Furthermore, a significantly increased prevalence of Hantavirus antibodies has been reported in patients with acute hepatitis of unknown cause from southwestern China 67 and in patients with chronic hepatitis from Japan. 68 However, the latter study failed to detect any Hantavirus antibodies in patients with acute hepatitis, thus implying a rather indirect pathogenetic role of Hantaviruses. Of note, Hantavirus infection has been observed to trigger acute exacerbations of autoimmune liver disease, and this mechanism has been proposed to contribute to community-acquired hepatitis. 69 Nevertheless, the precise role of Hantavirus infections in human liver disease still awaits clarification. Analogous to other bunyaviruses, Hantavirus is sensitive to ribavirin, which, although not approved by the Food and Drug Administration, can be used as emergency treatment. 70 infections are still relevant. In 1989, monkeys imported into the United States from the Philippines died of Ebola virus infection. Outbreaks still occur in western Africa, and the risk of undiagnosed patients arriving in industrialized countries remains real. Information on current outbreaks is available on the World Health Organization website (www.who.int/topics/ haemorrhagic_fevers_viral/en).",

Marked laboratory abnormalities include a striking leukopenia with immature granulocytes and abnormal lymphocytes, as well as thrombocytopenia. Filoviruses cause multifocal hepatic necrosis. Thus AST and ALT levels rise rapidly in the first days. Hypoproteinemia and proteinuria may also be present.

Based on genetic differences Section V-Liver Diseases Due to Infectious Agents without necrosis were present, but CMV inclusion bodies or CMV immunostaining were rarely detectable. 124, 125 Congenital CMV infection is observed in fewer than 2% of newborns and commonly occurs when mothers have primary CMV infection or reactivation of CMV during pregnancy. Approximately 10% of such neonates have symptoms at birth, including hepatosplenomegaly and jaundice. 126 Fetal CMV infection has also been associated with obstructive biliary disease and neonatal hepatitis with giant cell transformation, cholestasis, and viral inclusion bodies. 127 In CMV infection of the liver, endothelial cells, Kupffer cells, and hepatocytes become swollen and may contain basophilic granules in their cytoplasm. A typical intranuclear amphophilic inclusion body surrounded by a clear halo resembling an owl's eye may also be present (see Fig. 34-3, B) . Both nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions are full of virions. 128 CMV-related liver disease is the most common cause of acute viral hepatitis in patients after organ transplantation. Infection may result from reactivation of endogenous virus because of immunosuppression, transmission from the transplanted organ of a CMV-positive donor, or transfusion of blood and blood products. In liver transplantation, most CMV disease occurs after 1 and 4 months, and CMV infection is also discussed as a potential risk factor for the subsequent development of acute and chronic rejection. On the other hand, rejection therapy with corticosteroid boluses may trigger reactivation of endogenous CMV. Liver biopsy specimens from patients with posttransplant CMV hepatitis usually show scanty CMV inclusion bodies, which may be associated with small foci of necrosis and inflammation (microabscesses) (see Fig. 34-3, C) .",

[130] [131] [132] De novo appearance of CMV antibodies of the IgM class or a four-fold rise in IgG antibodies is considered indicative of active CMV infection in immunocompetent individuals. However, serology is unreliable in immunocompromised patients and is being replaced by quantitative molecular DNA amplification assays. [133] [134] [135] [136] Currently, most transplant centers perform CMV surveillance by weekly quantitative determination of CMV DNA and also administer hyperimmune antibodies or antiviral drugs for CMV prophylaxis to transplant recipients at high risk for acquiring CMV disease. 137,138 However, CMV infection and disease may still develop. In patients with immunodeficiency, CMV hepatitis should be treated promptly. At present, intravenous ganciclovir or oral valganciclovir for 3 weeks is the treatment of choice. Treatment can be continued in reduced doses as chemoprophylaxis if prolonged immunosuppression is anticipated. 139 Fortunately, ganciclovir resistance seems to be a rather rare event, 140 so the toxic alternatives cidofovir and foscarnet can largely be avoided.",

It is a particularly common complication in EBV-negative individuals who receive a graft from an EBV-positive donor, with primary EBV infection developing as a result of immunosuppression. 114 Clinical suspicion of EBV infection is confirmed by detection of heterophilic or EBV-specific antibodies in patients with infectious mononucleosis and quantitative PCR assays in those with lymphoproliferative disorders. 115, 116 Treatment of EBV infection is primarily supportive. Corticosteroid therapy can ameliorate the symptoms but is not generally recommended because EBV infection is usually a self-limited disease and there are theoretic concerns of suppression of immune responses with a viral infection, which can potentially cause malignant disease. Nevertheless, corticosteroids should be considered in individuals with lifethreatening complications such as imminent liver failure. Acyclovir inhibits EBV DNA polymerase, and antiviral therapy with this drug has shortened viral shedding but failed to demonstrate a convincing clinical benefit even in patients with severe acute EBV infection. 117 Acyclovir does not affect latent EBV infection. Thus anticancer chemotherapy, 118,119 B-cell monoclonal antibodies, 120-122 and if possible, a reduction in immunosuppression 123 are needed to treat EBV-related lymphoproliferative disorders, but antiviral therapy in general is not effective.",

            "text": "In about 10% of immunocompetent subjects, primary CMV infection produces an infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome that is associated with elevated serum aminotransferase levels and a mild hepatitis. Liver histology may show focal hepatocyte and bile duct damage with lymphocytic infiltration into the sinusoids. 124 In other patients, epithelioid granulomas rash and fever in children and immunocompromised individuals, the onset of HHV8-related diseases usually occurs several years after the acquisition of HHV8. Kaposi sarcoma, body cavity lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman disease are the typical manifestation of HHV8 infection, but bone marrow aplasia and multiple myeloma have also been described in association with this infection. 171 T lymphocytes play an important role in the control of HHV8 infection, which explains why the incidence of HHV8-related diseases is increased in patients with a transplant or AIDS. This concept is also supported by the observation that regression of Kaposi sarcoma is achieved when immunosuppression is reduced in patients with a transplant 172,173 and when highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has improved immune function in subjects with AIDS. 174 Other risk factors for Kaposi sarcoma, the predominant manifestation of HHV8-associated disease, are multiple homosexual contacts in HIV-infected men 175 and, in the transplant setting, male sex, old age, and lung transplantation. 176 In autopsy studies, Kaposi sarcoma has involved the liver in approximately 20% of subjects with AIDS, but its prevalence is declining with HAART. Hepatic Kaposi sarcoma is usually part of widespread cutaneous and visceral disease but may rarely be the primary manifestation. 177 Fulminant hepatic Kaposi sarcoma has also been observed in the first few weeks after liver transplantation (Fig. 34-4, A to E) . Macroscopically, dark red tumors 0.5 to 2 cm in diameter may be seen on the skin, the liver capsule, and the parenchyma. At the microscopic level, the typical lesion is a mesh of spindle cell-like tumour cells and dilated thin-walled vessels. 178 Diffuse plasma cells, infrequent mitosis, and clusters of intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions resembling small erythrocytes are further characteristic features. Hepatosplenomegaly, fever, and weight loss are typical features of multicentric Castleman disease, a noncancerous proliferation of B lymphocytes (see Fig. 34-4, F) . Lymphocytes in patients with multicentric Castleman disease and Kaposi sarcoma seem to cooperate with each other, and thus the two HHV8-related lesions can occasionally be found within the same lymph node. 179, 180 Ascites and pleural effusions may initially raise suspicion of some underlying liver disease in patients with HHV8-related body cavity lymphoma, but they can be differentiated by the presence of abundant lymphoma cells in aspirated fluid (see Fig. 34-4, G) . HHV8 can also cause solid organ lymphoma, which in the liver leads to diffuse sinusoidal accumulation of HHV8-infected B lymphocytes. 181 Reconstitution of immune function is a primary goal in the treatment of HHV8-associated diseases and, apart from HAART in HIV infection, may be achieved with the use of antiproliferative m-TOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitors for immune suppression in transplantation 182,183 or immune stimulation with imiquimod and interferon alfa. 184,185 Chemotherapy with liposomal anthracyclines or paclitaxel for Kaposi sarcoma 186,187 and rituximab for Castleman disease and lymphoma are further potent treatment options. 188 Ganciclovir, cidofovir, foscarnet, adefovir, and lobucavir, but not acyclovir, show some in vitro activity in blocking replication of HHV8-infected cell lines, and in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial, valganciclovir reduced oropharyngeal shedding of HHV8 by 80%. 189 CD46 receptor. 141 Though genetically clearly distinct from HHV6, HHV7 is another \u03b2-herpesvirus that shares many features with HHV6. Primary infection with either virus commonly occurs at a young age and can lead to a febrile illness known as exanthema subitum or roseola infantum. 142 Pityriasis rosea reflects primary infection with HHV7. Although the spectrum of diseases caused by HHV6 and HHV7 later on is not fully known, these viruses have been linked to a variety of different syndromes such as encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, pneumonitis, an infectious mononucleosis-like condition, and postinfectious drug hypersensitivity, as well as lymphoproliferative disorders and systemic disease in immunocompromised patients. 143 HHV6 can also cause hepatitis, which has occasionally resulted in liver failure in neonates and young infants. [144] [145] Moreover, HHV6 DNA and antigens have been detected in a significant proportion of children and adults who underwent transplantation for acute liver failure of unknown cause. 146-149 Of note, in two patients with HHV6 infection and imminent liver failure, HHV6 infection was controlled successfully with valganciclovir and with liver transplantation plus ganciclovir, respectively. 150 Hepatitis caused by HHV6 and HHV7 also complicates organ transplantation. 151-153 HHV6-induced acute liver failure and co-infection with hepatitis B and C viruses have been identified as risk factors for reactivation of HHV6 in patients after liver transplantation. 154, 155 Of note, HHV6 reactivation seems to significantly increase mortality in living related liver transplant recipients. 155 HHV6 and HHV7 can reactivate each other 156,157 and can also reactivate CMV infection and lead to symptomatic disease in liver transplant patients. 158 In addition, HHV6 has been associated with autoimmunity and postinfantile giant cell hepatitis, 159,160 as well as giant cell transformation of bile duct cells. 161 Seroconversion with at least a four-fold rise in IgG antibody titer between paired samples is considered diagnostic of HHV6 infection, but serology does not distinguish between HHV6A and HHV6B variants and may also be cross-reactive with HHV7. HHV6 IgM antibodies develop within a week after infection but are an unreliable marker because approximately 5% of healthy subjects may have a positive IgM test at any given time. 162 HHV6 can be detected in tissue samples by virus-specific monoclonal antibodies, but the preferred method for diagnosing HHV6 and HHV7 infection is by quantitative DNA amplification assays. [163] [164] [165] In most immunocompetent patients, HHV6 and HHV7 cause a benign self-limited infection that does not require specific antiviral treatment. Nevertheless, foscarnet is active against HHV6A, HHV6B, and HHV7 in vitro, whereas unlike HHV6B, both HHV6A and HHV7 may be relatively resistant to ganciclovir. [166] [167] [168] [169] Cidofovir may be a therapeutic alternative, but some resistant HHV6 isolates have been identified. 170 Although in vitro studies and anecdotal reports in the transplant setting seem to suggest some beneficial effects in human infections, 150,169 antiviral therapy against HHV6 or HHV7 has not yet been evaluated in controlled trials.",

In most patients, aminotransferase levels started to rise toward the end of the first week and peaked at the end of the second week. With resolution of SARS, aminotransferases normalized spontaneously in the majority of patients. Severe liver damage (ALT more than five times the upper limit of normal) was observed more frequently in male patients and those with significant other co-morbid conditions or elevated serum creatinine levels. 215 The role of concomitant hepatitis B in disease severity is controversial. 214,215 However, there was a close relationship between the severity of hepatic dysfunction and degree of pulmonary damage and the outcome of SARS. 214 Thus high ALT levels appeared to be an independent predictor of more severe disease and a worse outcome. Histopathologic studies revealed marked apoptosis of hepatocytes and conspicuous (presumably compensatory) mitotic activity. 216 Hepatocytes also showed some ballooning, and mild to moderate lymphocytic infiltrates were described in the portal tracts and liver lobules. Although SARS-CoV RT-PCR was consistently positive in liver specimens, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy failed to detect viral antigens and viral particles in several biopsy and postmortem studies. 216-218 Thus only small amounts of SARS-CoV seem to school-aged children and occasionally also in adults. Arthropathy and aplastic anemia are further complications in adults. Fetal infection during gestation is a cause of hydrops fetalis, which is associated with marked damage to the liver 241 ; hepatocytes have ballooned, swollen nuclei that harbor eosinophilic nuclear inclusion bodies. In addition, erythroid-myeloid precursors are greatly expanded in the sinusoids. Parvovirus B19 has also been identified as a cause of acute hepatitis 242 and has been incriminated as the underlying cause in acute liver failure with anemia. 243 However, a subsequent study could not confirm parvovirus B19 as a cause of fulminant hepatic failure. 244",

Torquetenominivirus and related viruses with smaller genomes, provisionally designated as small anelloviruses, are further members of this genus. TTV can be subdivided into five phylogenetic groups, 1 to 5, and co-infection with several genotypes is common. Some TTV variants have their own designation, such as SEN virus, named after the patient from whom it had been isolated.",

Thus the clinical significance of TTV infections remains uncertain. Inoculation of chimpanzees with TTV led to viremia but did not cause hepatitis. 246 Moreover, several studies on TTV transmission failed to establish any consistent relationship between TTV viremia and elevated serum aminotransferase levels. 247-249 Nevertheless, it cannot be excluded that TTV is responsible for acute hepatitis in some subsets of patients, 247,250 and if so, TTV seems to cause a rather mild form of hepatitis. 251 Likewise, most studies also could not confirm any consistent associations between persistence of TTV and the presence of biochemical and histologic hepatic abnormalities in a variety of different clinical settings. 248,252-254 TTV infection does not seem to trigger autoimmune hepatitis, 255 and a casecontrol study failed to establish TTV as an independent risk for factor hepatocellular carcinoma. 256 Taken together, it seems most likely that the initial reports of an increased TTV prevalence in patients with chronic liver disease 257,258 reflect shared risk factors for infection and liver damage rather than TTV as the cause of the liver disease.",
