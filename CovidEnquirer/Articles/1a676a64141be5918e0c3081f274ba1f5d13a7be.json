However, it was found that a mixture of two HIV-1 proteinase inhibitors, lopinavir and ritonavir, exhibited some signs of effectiveness against the SARS virus. To understand the fine details of the molecular interactions between these proteinase inhibitors and the SARS virus via complexation, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for the SARS-CoV 3CL pro free enzyme (free SARS) and its complexes with lopinavir (SARS-LPV) and ritonavir (SARS-RTV). The results show that flap closing was clearly observed when the inhibitors bind to the active site of SARS-CoV 3CL pro . The binding affinities of LPV and RTV to SARS-CoV 3CL pro do not show any significant difference. In addition, six hydrogen bonds were detected in the SARS-LPV system, while seven hydrogen bonds were found in SARS-RTV complex.",

In March 2003, four months after the first case was reported, the causative agent of SARS was identified as a new coronavirus (CoV) (Kuiken et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003) . The complete genomic sequence (29,751 nucleotides) of the +ssRNA virus was reported a month later (Marra et al., 2003) , providing the opportunity for more in-depth studies and the identification of potential targets for drug and vaccine development. The genome of SARS-CoV contains 11-14 major annotated open reading frames including those predicted to encode for known viral proteins, including the replicase polyproteins, S (spike protein), polymerase, M (membrane protein), N (nucleocapsid protein) and E (small envelope protein). The viral proteinase and replicase are the preferred targets for searching and designing of antiviral compounds. Indeed, the SARS-CoV main proteinase, 3CL pro (also called M pro ), exhibits a key role in proteolytic processing of the replicase polyproteins and, as an essential protein for viral replication and function, is viewed as a key target.",

Thus, sequence alignment of the SARS-CoV 3CL pro with orthologues from other coronaviruses indicated that the enzyme is highly conserved, with 40% and 44% sequence identity, respectively, to human CoV (HCoV) 229E proteinase and procine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) proteinase . The crystal structure of the 3CL pro protein has been determined Hsu et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2005) , revealing that it is similar to those of other CoV proteinases. SARS-CoV 3CL pro forms a homodimer, comprised of three domains. Domains I (residues 8-101) and II (residues 102-184) are b-barrels and together resemble the structure of chymotrypsin, respectively, whereas domain III (residues 201-306) consists mainly of a-helices.",

Energy minimization and MD simulations were achieved using the SANDER module of AMBER 7 with the Cornell force field (Cornell et al., 1995) . The parm99 force field, which describes the structure and conformation of each compound, was applied. All MD runs reported here were achieved under an isobaric-isothermal ensemble (NPT) using a constant pressure of 1 atm and a constant temperature of 298 K. The SHAKE algorithm (Ryckaert et al., 1977) was used to constrain all bonds involving hydrogen atoms. Energy minimizations were carried out to relax the system prior to MD runs. To incorporate the solvent and counter ions into the models, each system was neutralized with the counter ions (Na + ) and solvated with the TIP3P water model (Jorgensen et al., 1983) . The total number of atoms for the three simulated systems, free SARS, SARS-LPV and SARS-RTV, were 77,866, 77,966 and 86,788, respectively. The crystallographic waters were also kept in the simulation box. The simulation time step was set at 2 femtosecond (fs). The simulation steps consist of thermalization, equilibration, and production phases. Initially, the temperature of the system was gradually raised to 298 K for the first 60 picosecond (ps) and then kept constant according to the Berendsen algorithm with a coupling time of 0.2 ps. The systems were maintained at 298 K, until 600 ps. Finally, the production phase started from 600 ps to 2 ns. The 1400 ps trajectories of the production phase were used to calculate the average structure. All MD simulations were carried out for 2 ns. The quality of the geometry and the stereochemistry of the protein structures were validated using PROCHECK. MD trajectories were evaluated in terms of the root-mean-square displacement (RMSD), changes of the distances, torsion angles, H-bond and binding free energies using the CARNAL, Ptraj and MM-PBSA modules of the AMBER7 simulation package.",

Conformational changes of the catalytic binding domain play a critical role in ligand binding. Here, the ligand-binding site of the SARS-CoV 3CL pro was evaluated focusing on the amino acid sequence around the active sites (H41 and C145, see Fig. 2 ) of the CoV proteinase (Anand et al., 2002 Yang et al., 2003) . The binding of the inhibitor is likely to affect the relative motion between the apex of the loop with respect to the D48 and Q189 loops upon the insertion of inhibitor. The probability distributions of the associated interatomic distances from the center of mass of the following residues for the three systems, d1:H41-C145 and d2:D48-Q189, were evaluated and plotted (Fig. 4) . Clearly, SARS-CoV 3CL pro shows different dynamic flexibilities in the binding region when the SARS-selective inhibitors are bound to their active sites. In the SARS-CoV 3CL pro free enzyme, the most probable d1 distance between H41 and C145 takes place at about 10.0 \u00c5 , but this is contracted to $7.1-7.3 \u00c5 in the enzyme-inhibitor complexes. For the distance between D48 and Q189, d2, in the loop region, no significant differences were observed between free enzyme and two enzyme-inhibitor complexes. Rather the optimal distances, represented by the maximum of the plots, for both SARS-CoV 3CL pro and its two inhibitor complexes are between 8.64 and 10.02 \u00c5 (Fig. 4b) .",

Similarly, this kind of flap (loop) closing was also observed when inhibitors bind in the active site of HIV-1 protease (Hornak et al., 2006a b) . In addition, the SARS-RTV distribution plots are narrower and higher than those of the SARS-LPV, indicating a lower flexibility of the catalytic pocket and the flap loop of the SARS-RTV complex compared to that of the SARS-LPV complex. This fact relates directly to the greater flexibility of the longer side chain of the RTV than that of the LPV.",

However, the van der Waals interactions and nonpolar solvation terms of the SARS-RTV complex are unfavorable by 4.3 kcal/mol relative to those of the SARS-LPV complex. Summing the above contributions, the total binding free energy of the SARS-LPV complex is only slightly more favorable than that of the SARS-RTV complex at \u00c047.2 and \u00c045.3 kcal/mol, respectively. This close similarity, with only \u00c01.9 kcal/mol difference, is due to structural similarity of both complexes.

The analysis of the energetic binding affinity between the HIV-1 proteinase inhibitors has been extensively performed based on free energy calculations. We have found that the interaction of LPV and RTV does not show a significant difference for the SARS-CoV 3CL pro enzyme. ",
