The two main ways to gain effective treatment include taking rehydration solutions (ORS's) and taking food again as soon as possible. F To bringabout oral rehydration, make sure the first ORS dose (a full sachet in 200 mL water) is given to baby right after she/he's had her/his first watery stools and the following doses are given until her/his stools are back to normal. Risk of vomiting can be curbed if sachet contents are given out in small amounts, every 5 to 10 minutes, over a period of 30 minutes, even if she/he has kept vomiting until then. Pure or soda water are not recommended as they are hyperosmolar beverage, ie they are poor in sodium and potassium. F About giving food again as soon as possible: carry on breast-feeding while it alternates with RSO doses. To small babies under 4 months of age, mothers can give a milk substitute including hydrolised proteins. An anti-diarrhoea drug/tablet, such as rac\u00e9cadotril (Tiorfan \u00ae ), can possibly be prescribed for adjuvant treatment. F Washing hands is required before and after giving treatment to baby, changing baby clothes and giving baby food. What is acute gastro-enteritis in young children? G astritis is usually a benign disease even if at times it can be a threat to child's life. Gastritis is an inflammation of both gastric and intestinal mucosa due to certain viruses, bacteria, parasites or other toxic causes. The major symptom for gastritis is acute diarrhoea with a possible risk of acute dehydration, which makes gastritis a serious condition, as said above. Viral gastritis is quite common amongst children at winter time. It ranks first amongst the reasons why babies are taken to hospital. Gastritis is usually a benign disease even if at times it can be a threat to child's life. Most times, the attack comes from rotavirus+++ (other viruses may be calivirus, adenovirus or coronavirus), from Escherichia coli, Shigella, Salmonella, from vibrio cholerae or certain other parasites (Giarda, Amoebae, &). For effective treatment, it is essential to give baby liquid and solid food again as soon as possible.",
