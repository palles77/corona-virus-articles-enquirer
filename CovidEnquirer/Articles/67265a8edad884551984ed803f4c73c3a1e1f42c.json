            "text": "Infection with an avirulent strain of Semliki Forest virus (SFV-A7) facilitates the development of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in a genetically resistant BALB/c mouse strain. Irradiation which is necessary for EAE induction caused a decrease in the total number of lymphocytes and an increase in CD4+/CD8 + T cell ratio in the spleen of BALB/c mice. EAE induction increased the ratio further until clinical and histological signs of EAE appeared. Entry of perivascular CD4 + and CD8 \u00f7 cells preceded the onset of clinical signs and the appearance of MAC-1 + cells in the central nervous system (CNS). In the acute phase of EAE, cellular infiltrates, which were sparse, consisted mainly of MAC-1 \u00f7 cells and a few CD4 \u00f7 and CD8 + cells. Inflammatory cells gradually disappeared during the recovery phase. SFV-A7 infection after irradiation and EAE induction did not significantly change the CD4+/CD8 \u00f7 ratio in the spleen or in the CNS infiltrates but enhanced the entry of inflammatory cells into the CNS. Similar perivascular cell influx was also seen in untreated mice infected with SFV-A7. We conclude that observed rapid reduction of splenic mononuclear cells and increase of the CD4+/CD8 \u00f7 T cell ratio caused by irradiation prior EAE induction are early crucial events in disease induction in this resistant strain of mice. SFV-A7 infection, which further facilitates the development of EAE, does not induce immunoregulatory changes but provides its effect by enhancing the entry of inflammatory cells into the CNS. The combination of these two mechanisms thus effectively breaks the natural resistance against EAE in this genetically resistant mouse strain.",

Myelin basic protein (MBP)activated CD4 + T cells from SJL/J mice with EAE can transfer the disease to naive recipients (Pettinelli and McFarlin, 1981) . It has been shown that activated MBP-specific CD4 + T cells cause typical EAE in naive Lewis rats but the same treatment results in haemorrhagic cellular infiltrates in CNS of rats immunosuppressed chemically or by irradiation (Sedgwick et al., 1987) . This suggests that the cells may mediate the effect by inducing vascular damage (Sedgwick et al., 1987) . In susceptible DA rats an increase in CD4+/CD8 \u00f7 T cell ratio in blood after induction of EAE occurs before the appearance of clinical disease. This increase is due to the generation of a high number of antigen-specific CD4 + T ceils after sensitization with neuroantigen (Vukmanovic et al., 1990) .",

There is evidence that CD8 + cells in the murine EAE are responsible for disease suppression (Lider et al., 1989) and for resistance to a second induction of EAE after recovery from the first episode (Jiang et al., 1992) . In Lewis rat, however, long-term depletion of CD8 + T cells did not change the induction, recovery or subsequent resistance phases of the disease (Sedgwick, 1988) . Furthermore, intraperitoneal injection of mice with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for the mouse CD8 antigen neither alters the disease course nor leads to an increase in severity of histological or neurological signs of EAE in SJL mice (Sriram and Carroll, 1988) . In the mutant CD8-/-mice the EAE onset and susceptibility were unchanged. Acute EAE was milder with fewer deaths but lead more often to a chronic disease with a higher frequency of relapses. This suggests that CD8 \u00f7 T lymphocytes have a role both as effectors and as regulators in EAE (Koh et al., 1992) .",

Scale bar equals 100 ~zm in tissue section. 1989). It can be argued that the change in the CD4+/CD8 + ratio after irradiation explains the increased sensitivity of BALB/c mice to EAE induction as the increased CD4+/CD8 \u00f7 ratio was maintained until clinical disease appeared. Without EAE induction the ratio quickly returned to normal.",

            "text": "Irradiation is essential for the development of EAE in this model of EAE since EAE induction of nonirradiated mice does not result in the clinical disease either with or without additional infection with SFV. Irradiation is associated with general splenocyte depletion and results in the increase in CD4+/CD8 + ratio. Thus, the primary irradiation-induced increase in the CD4+/CD8 \u00f7 ratio may be essential for the development of EAE. The further increase in the ratio seen after EAE induction is due to primary sensitization with neuroantigen and adjuvant and developed encephalitogenic T cells are needed for the initiation of autoimmune reactions. The increase in CD4+/CD8 \u00f7 ratio after CFA and pertussis injections in irradiated mice is not enough for EAE induction because encephalitogenic ceils are lacking. We consider that the change in CD4 \u00f7/CD8 \u00f7 ratio is of primary importance in the initiation of the autoimmune process. However, it may not be important at all after the autoimmune process has started and cells infiltrate the CNS. It has earlier been shown that EAE induction with spinal cord homogenate leads to an increased CD4+/CD8 \u00f7 ratio in blood of genetically susceptible rats while the ratio remains unchanged in genetically resistant rats (Vukmanovic et al., 1990) . Irradiation may thus have a stronger effect on cells which control the disease (e.g. suppressor cells) than on cells which are responsible for disease induction (antigen-specific CD4 \u00f7 T cells).",

It is thus unlikely that the facilitating effect on development of EAE is due to changes in immunological balance.",

It has earlier been shown that SFV-A7 infection leads to infiltration of mononuclear cells to the brain in infected mice (Berger, 1980) even if mice remain clinically healthy. Infection may also cause blood-brain barrier damage which would facilitate the entry of encephalitogenic cells and cytokines into the CNS. This is suggested by our present observation of large mononuclear cell infiltrates in EAE mice after virus infection as compared to scarce mononuclear cells in the brains of sick mice after EAE induction without virus infection. Inflammatory cells formed infiltrates consisting of CD4 \u00f7, CD8 \u00f7 and numerous MAC-1 + ceils. This suggests that virus infection leads to a generalized entry of mononuclear ceils into the CNS in the absence of encephalitogeneic effector cells.",

Infiltrating lymphocytes are predominantly CD4 \u00f7 but the proportion of CD8 + cells is greater than in uninfected EAE mice. We consider that in EAE the presence of numerous activated cells in the periphery results in the increased entry of these cells into the CNS and this migration is enhanced by the virus infection. This facilitated entry may lead to increased entry of encephalitogenic cells which at this stage cannot be controlled by 'suppressor' cells. Therefore, the proportion of CD8 \u00f7 ceils in the periphery is important in the early phase of disease but may not be important in the CNS after the autoimmune process has been initiated.",

            "text": "In the murine models of EAE cellular infiltrates are less extensive as compared to other rodent models of EAE. Studies on EAE in SJL mice have revealed a characteristic predominance of CD4 \u00f7, CD8 \u00f7 T ceils in developing inflammatory cell infiltrates which is followed by appearance of minute B cells and macrophages shortly before onset of clinical signs of EAE. Cellular infiltrates are most pronounced in the acute phase of disease and are found perivascularily in CNS parenchyma and meninges (Sriram et al., 1982; Traugott et al., 1985) . In our BALB/c model of EAE, cells with CD4 + and CD8 + characteristics are similarly predominant in the developing lesion and MAC-1 + cells are found disseminated in CNS parenchyma. Subsequently, MAC-1 + cells rapidly become the major inflammatory cell population in CNS infiltrates. The excess of MAC-1 \u00f7 cells in BALB/c EAE lesion in the acute phase of disease indicates the central role of phagosytosis in the demyelination process, similar to acute MS lesions. EAE, especially the chronic form, shows many similarities to multiple sclerosis and can, therefore, be used as an animal model for MS. Clinical exacerbations in MS are often associated with virus infections (Sibley et al., 1985) and virus infections may thus trigger exacerbations. EAE in BALB/c mouse is a model of autoimmune demyelination where virus infection increases both clinical signs and neuropathological changes of the disease. This seems to be due to direct viral effects rather than changes in immune regulation. Further characterization of this model may give useful information applicable to studies on clinical relapses of multipie sclerosis.",
