            "text": "Pinnipedia is a suborder of carnivorous mammals found exclusively in aquatic habitats. The suborder includes three recognized extant families: Odobenidae (walrus), Otoriidae (sea lions and fur seals), and Phocidae (true seals). Members of this suborder are easily recognized by their general body shape and the morphology of the appendages that are adapted to the aquatic environment. Both thoracic and pelvic appendages are modified for effective locomotion in water and take the form of flippers. In otoriids, the thoracic appendages are the dominant ones and also allow the animals to support the weight of the trunk on land and effectively \"walk,\" whereas the phocids do not; and odobenids, although able to support their trunks with the forelimbs, are less agile. Members of this suborder are found around the entire globe, including the Arctic and Antarctic regions. One genus, Pusa (which includes the Ladoga ringed seal, the Saimaa ringed seal, and the Baikal seal) has established a niche in fresh water habitats, whereas the remainder is marine. The smallest pinniped, Pusa sibirica (the Baikal seal), which weighs about 45 kilograms (kg) when full grown, grows to about 1 meter (m) long; the largest, Mirounga leonina (the male Southern elephant seal), grows to about 5 m long and weighs up to 3200 kg. 4 Many pinnipeds are typically found foraging and resting in and near the relatively shallow waters of the littoral zone; others spend most of their lives as pelagic animals, and still others are pagophilic (ice loving).",

Data are deficient, and for a number of other species, no status determination may be made at this time. 38 At the time of writing this chapter, approximately 1100 individual Hawaiian monk seals were estimated to make up the entire population, which is declining at a rate of approximately 4% per year. 53 In contrast, many other pinniped populations are thriving and increasing in numbers and resulting in conflict with human interests or activities. This, at times, results in harassment, injury, or death of animals. Negative human interactions (fishing gear or trash entanglement, gunshots, boat strike, etc.) account for as much as 8% to 10% of the cases admitted to rehabilitation centers in North America annually.",

Providing access to deeper pools and encouraging dive behavior by placing novel objects on the pool floor appear to have been contributing factors in the reduction of cases.

This is important to keep in mind, as this site is also the most easily accessible for peripheral blood collection in phocid seals. On occasion, clinical chemistry and blood gas results may be impacted by the flow dynamics at this site. The author and his colleagues have infused euthanasia solution at this site with no effect until it was followed by a large bolus of fluids. Phocids also have prominent abdominal venous plexuses that drain to a large \"hepatic sinus\" and then to the thoracic vena cava. At the diaphragm, a muscular sphincter appears to \"meter out\" blood as cardiac preload during dives. This is augmented by sympathetically mediated splenic contraction during dives. Venous partial pressure of oxygen may actually exceed arterial partial pressure of oxygen at times as a result of the unique ability of these animals to \"shunt\" blood to metabolically active tissues. 67 Phocid males do not have a scrotum of any significance; the testes are contained within the inguinal region and may be difficult to locate by palpation.",

Conscious individual animals often are more resistant to attempts to pass something per rectum than to blood sampling.",

            "text": "empirical perspective, this makes sense. Pinniped eyes, as is the case with all marine mammal eyes, are particularly adapted for low-light visual acuity. These animals forage in the water column, some at great depths with low ambient light. When the animals are kept away from these depths and fed in air, as is often the case with collection animals, their eyes are exposed to more solar radiation than in their natural habitat. Husbandry conditions are a likely contributing factor, so preventive measures should be a priority. Provision of shade; darkened, nonreflective surfaces; feeding underwater; and stringent attention to water quality must be considered in a preventive medicine plan for pinnipeds. In one published study of 111 captive pinnipeds, 48.6% had lens disease, cataracts, or both. 11 Another study documented ocular pathology in 81.5% of 27 captive pinnipeds and only 35% of wild submitted ones. 49 The conclusion was that diseases of the eye are \"common\" in wild and captive pinnipeds, although a higher prevalence exists in captive populations. However, a retrospective search of the medical records of documented pathology from 10,919 California sea lions presented to TMMC revealed only 272 (2.5%) results with recorded ocular disease. This topic has received considerable attention in the literature (refer to the discussion by Gage in the seventh edition of this text).",

            "text": "Water quality also has a powerful impact on overall pinniped health and welfare. These animals evolved over millions of years to spend most of their waking hours (and many of their sleeping hours) in the sea, a thick soup of microbial life that has evolved over billions of years; the so-called \"rare biosphere.\" This biomass is immense; 98% of the primary production of the oceans and the mediation of all biogeochemical processes in the oceans are accounted for by these microbes. 60 Pinnipeds are merely visitors to this microbial world, but they visit often. They bathe in it, bask in it, swallow it, cover their bodies with it, soak their mucous membranes in it, even inhale it. They have successfully established biologic mechanisms to live in harmony with it, most of the time. It is all about balance. When conditions tip the balance in favor of the microbes, disease may result. The clinical veterinarian will do well to keep in mind the triad of factors that influence the development of disease: the host, the agent, and the environment. Numerous reports of microbial surveillance in free-ranging animals and those that have presented as patients have been published. In a study of healthy pinnipeds off the California coast directed at detection of Salmonella spp., 21% of California sea lion pups and 87% of Northern elephant seal pups were culture positive for Salmonella spp. 63 What is really needed for effective management of pinniped health is better understanding of the influences on the aquatic system that favor the microbes, and pressures on even the natural system appear to be increasing. Perhaps this is the explanation for the observation that blooms of diatoms responsible for the production of domoic acid and the resulting intoxication in animals appear to be increasing in frequency and magnitude off the coastal North American Pacific. 41 More importantly for clinical veterinarians, artificial habitats may always be expected to place some selection pressures on the microbial ecology of the water within. Alterations of the abiotic water parameters are often performed with the presumed aim of creating a \"healthier\" environment for inhabitants. In the United States, the water quality of permanent marine mammal enclosures is mandated by the Animal Welfare Act of 1972, as amended and promulgated by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). With respect to the microbial content of water, the mandate states: \"The coliform bacteria count of the primary enclosure pool shall not exceed 1000 MPN (most probable number) per 100 milliliters (mL) of water.\" 9 This is, in fact, a fairly easy standard to meet through oxidation, as detailed in an instructional pamphlet published by the USDA titled \"The Sterilization of Marine Mammal Pool Waters.\" 61 However, this author argues that in all things, artificial and controlled environments should aim to mimic the natural environment, whenever possible, and that excessive oxidation may work against this goal. The author' s Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries, and these standards contain useful information regarding the special housing requirements for this taxon. 23 In the author' s opinion, it would be difficult to provide an animal too much dry haul-out space or too much water to swim in. Pinnipeds tend to be gregarious, often associating in groups, particularly when hauled out. The tendency for direct contact between hauled-out individuals seems to vary with species. California sea lions are often observed resting while in contact, even on top of one another. Harbor seals, in contrast, appear to desire a gap between each other and, as mentioned earlier, will often \"swat\" at each other if they get too close. Interestingly, weather conditions may impact the distance between individuals. During rain, resting sea lions have been observed to separate, leaving some space between each other. Sea lions, in particular, appear to enjoy climbing up on structures and will often be seen resting on pool walls, transport crates, shelves, and almost anything that allows them purchase to climb.",

They are adapted to maintain body temperature while spending much of their lives in the perennial \"heat sink\" of the ocean. Core body temperature of most is approximately 37\u00b0 C. Even in \"warmer\" water environments, the water temperature is lower than core body temperature, and the thermal conductivity of water is about 25 times that of air. Thus, the insulation and circulatory adaptations discussed above are designed to maintain core body temperature; when the animal is out of the water, the risk of hyperthermia is always present. A sea lion that has restricted access to water and is producing metabolic heat because of muscular activity such as pacing or struggling against restraint may quickly develop heat prostration. When in doubt, the animal should be cooled off with a dousing of water. It is very difficult to get a pinniped too cold or too wet. Emaciated young animals are an exception to this rule (animals under anesthesia are another). This special class of patients lacks the insulation, is often metabolically challenged, may have immature physiologic mechanisms for thermoregulation and is thus prone to hypothermia when ambient air temperatures are low, particularly if the animals are wet. Protection from the elements must be provided for this special class of patients. Thermal stress risks are the opposite for older animals in fair to good body condition. This author is aware, some concern is felt that a wet animal will heat up faster than a dry one. Recommendations have been made to avoid wetting the animals when they are lying in the sun. These recommendations have been based on published observation that a wet hair coat will be darker in coloration compared with a dry one and thus will absorb more solar radiation. 40 This report did not take into account evaporative cooling or measure core temperatures or any thermal flux from the animals themselves; rather, it was focused on enclosure design. The authors of that paper also made several assumptions based on measures from terrestrial animals. Pinnipeds are not terrestrial animals. Individual pinnipeds often appear to be less anxious and more comfortable when in water. Animals transported from one location to another unfamiliar location will often stay in the water almost exclusively (sometimes swimming for days) until they become comfortable in the new surroundings. Wetting an animal will also often stimulate defecation. If physiologically stable, young orphans should be exposed to water following feeding to encourage normal GI motility. Adult sea lions with reduced appetites may sometimes be enticed to eat by directing a steady stream of water from a hose to the face.",

Protection from exposure to solar radiation is probably significant with regard to the ocular health of pinnipeds. Evidence that keratopathies and secondary intraocular disease are associated with solar radiation exposure is increasing. Captive pinnipeds that did not have access to shade were almost 10 times as likely to develop lens luxations, cataracts, or both compared with those provided shade. 21 From an classes of marine mammals. The caloric content of individual lots of fish fed is also easily calculated from a simple proximate analysis of a sample, and many facilities use caloric density of fish lots to determine ration formulation. Practically, feeding decisions may be simplified by monitoring body weights. Assuming that the handling has been proper and monitored, if a variety of items expected to be found in the animals' natural diet (a variety of fish types and perhaps an invertebrate or two) are fed, the diet may be expected to be balanced. If the fed diet meets energy requirements, the animals will grow or gain weight, depending on their stage of nutrition and health status. If not, the animals will lose weight or not grow. Therefore, an accurate means of monitoring body condition is essential. Regular body weights will suffice in most instances, although more detailed assessments, including ultrasonographic determination of \"blubber\" thickness or thermographic profiles over time may be useful in some animals. The clinician should also remember that a \"lag time\" often occurs with any ration change. An animal that has had an increase of caloric intake may not show any weight gain for a week or two and likewise an animal that has had a reduction in intake may not lose weight for a week or two.",

Like other marine mammals, pinnipeds are well known to \"mask\" signs of pathology, appearing normal in spite of significant underlying disease. Appetite and attitude are often the first to change in an ill animal. In general, any collection animal that refuses food without an obvious explanation should be evaluated for a medical disorder. A reduction in appetite may be the only indication of serious illness. However, pinnipeds do fast at times during states of normal health. Elephant seal weanlings fast for 4 to 6 weeks following the departure of the dam prior to initiating foraging. They survive this entire period without any oral intake, neither food nor water, after which they \"switch modes\" to foraging and begin to seek and perhaps find solid foods to sustain themselves. Animals of this age group are frequently presented for rehabilitation and present a challenge in determining whether they should be fed or not. To date, no practical and specific biomarker of physiologic status that indicates the fasting or foraging stage has been recognized. Plasma hormone levels and fatty acid profiles have been investigated, and ratios of serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to creatine (Cr) have showed some promise but have not held up in clinical experience. Intact adult pinniped males will often go \"off feed\" during times of rut behavior and may not eat for weeks at a time. The clinician faced with a pinniped that refuses food must carefully weigh all the evidence at hand and, when in doubt, pursue an investigation that includes at a minimum a complete blood cell (CBC) count and a serum chemistry profile. Although pinnipeds appear to be exceptionally adept at metabolic water production via oxidative phosphorylation of fats, fresh water should be made available at all times.",

It must be kept in mind that these animals are predominantly piscivorous. Protein sources other than fish are not optimal, although some have a strong record of being used with success. Pinniped milk, like the milk of other marine mammals, is virtually devoid of carbohydrates. In fact, marine mammals really never ingest oral carbohydrates, so their inclusion in the fed diet is unnatural. Disorders of GI motility are not uncommon in artificially reared neonate seals and sea lions. Diarrhea, ileus, atony, and impaction have all been noted clinically. Carbohydrates included in the artificial diet have long been suspected to cause these problems. The microbial flora establishing itself in neonates, along with the brush border enzymes and anything else influenced by the biochemical milieu, may be disturbed by exposure to carbohydrate. experience with both natural and artificial systems has provided strong evidence for just how different the aquatic microbial ecology is between the two types. Evidence also indicates that these differences are manifested clinically as animal health issues. The author has suggested that this situation is similar to the \"Hygiene Hypothesis,\" as discussed in human medicine, and it has been termed the \"Aquatic Animal Hygiene Hypothesis.\" 8, 70 While many pinnipeds have been, and some continue to be, housed in fresh water systems, the author and colleagues believe that this is not the most appropriate environment for a marine mammal and that it undoubtedly places some significant physiologic stress on the animals.

Stomach contents and scats of phocids and otariids often contain remnants of invertebrates as well. Squids, octopoids, and crustaceans are commonly consumed, in addition to fishes of all sorts. In permanent collections, most pinnipeds are fed diets similar to those of cetaceans (dolphins and whales), generally a teleost fish-based ration comprising commercially available \"bait\" species such as herring (Clupeidae), mackerel (Scombridae), and smelt (Osmeridae).

Proper handling of food fishes must include attention to time-temperature profiles. As a general rule, the shorter the time the product is held and the colder the temperature it is held at, the higher is the expected quality and the lower is the likelihood of nutrient degradation, particularly fatsoluble vitamin oxidation. It is this concern about degradation that apparently drives supplementation-not recognized deficiencies or toxicoses. All food handling from producer source selection, shipping, storage, \"breakout,\" feeding, and cleanup should be subjected to thorough oversight and review. A hazards analysis and critical control point (HACCP) approach, as used for human food service safety, is a wise approach and may, in fact, reduce the costs of future problems significantly.

These nets are tossed over the animal, again with the help of boarders or, in the case of animals on the beach, with a net frame and handle. As the animal moves into the net, the net diameter narrows until only the muzzle of the animal is exposed and the fore flippers are effectively pinned against the trunk. Experienced personnel may grasp the back end of the net, take several wraps to further tighten the net against the fore flippers, and immobilize the animal effectively by lifting the back end. Additional restrainers may then assist in pinning the animal against the deck, again paying close attention to effective breathing in the animal. Many simple procedures and sample collections may be conducted in this manner. If further restraint is needed, the animal may then be anesthetized safely with an inhalant agent delivered via a face mask.

A robust and growing number of excellent reference resources are now available, and the reader is encouraged to consult these when planning a sedation or anesthesia procedure. 6, 31, 32, 37, 43 Table 44 -1 lists the current chemical induction protocols routinely used in otariids and phocids at TMMC. Current best practices continue to change rapidly with continued experience and retrospective analyses of past procedures. 64 A review of the literature and consultation with experienced practitioners will help obtain useful recommendations, for example, with regard to the use of atropine, the value of end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO 2 ) that would indicate controlled ventilation, and so on. The clinician is always responsible for making adjustments to plans in response to information at hand and literature review, keeping in mind that statistical significance does not always imply clinical significance or effectiveness. This appears to be particularly important when using injectable chemical agents in larger free-ranging otariids, using techniques such as remote delivery via darting. In the author' s experience, the differing responses to these combinations appear to be associated with the level of awareness or preexisting anxiety in the animal. Doses effectively inducing a deep sedation or a light plane of anesthesia in an animal that was darted while asleep and did not perceive a threat when roused by the dart, may not be as effective in a same-sized animal that is aroused or anxious before or during In health, pinnipeds acutely switch from suckling to solids without a transitional time of premasticated, regurgitated gruels fed by a parent, as in so many piscivorous birds. Young animals go from sucking milk one day to, in the case of phocids with a minimalistic maternal investment, fasting for a while, to eating solid fish. During attempts to artificially rear them at TMMC, often out of necessity, during a transition period gruel or \"fish mash\"-an unnatural diet-has been incorporated. Solid fish are generally swallowed whole or with little chewing in the normal weaned animal. The stomach is muscular and serves to masticate the food. Tube feeding gruel, although often necessary, may lead to motility disorders.",

The animal may then be pinned to the deck by grasping at the base of the skull, straddling the animal, and holding the fore flippers is oriented vertically, in line with the glottis, and the insertion is timed with a breath. A gentle rotation of the tube as it is advanced will often help in its proper positioning. The cuff should be positioned just beyond the laryngeal cartilages, keeping in mind that the otariid carina is at the thoracic inlet. The patient' s vital signs should be monitored during the anesthesia period as in any terrestrial species.

Although darting has proven very useful and effective, substantial variation in dart delivery seems to exist. Induction times and responses tend to be longer and less predictable when the thigh muscles are used compared with the muscles of the neck and shoulders. It is the author' s hypothesis that this has to do with the presence of more fascial planes between the numerous muscle bodies of the thigh compared with the larger mass of muscles of the pectoral girdle and neck.

            "text": "In the author' s experience, the two biggest risks during chemical sedation and anesthesia of pinnipeds are airway maintenance and control of body temperature. During induction and recovery, it is imperative that the airway be maintained and monitored. The pinniped has robust distensible pharyngeal soft tissue that may easily obstruct and occlude the glottis when the animal' s level of awareness is diminished. If the animal gets into a position that may cause airway obstruction, it should be roused or repositioned immediately. On more than one occasion, sea lions have suffocated during induction in a transport or restraint cage because they folded up against the side. When manually restraining animals during induction, it must be ensured that nothing compresses the pharynx or trachea and that the airway is clear. The optimal position for the head and neck is extension with the mouth open. This position also facilitates endotracheal (ET) intubation (Figure 44-4) . A rope or cord loop is placed around the maxilla behind canine teeth and another around the mandible again caudal to canine teeth to hold the head and neck straight out and the mouth open. With larger animals on the deck, it may be necessary to straddle the neck first and have the animal facing the intubator. A laryngoscope may be used to depress the base of the tongue to visualize the glottis. In some smaller animals, particularly phocids, it may not be possible to visualize the glottis, and the tube is best guided by a gloved hand through the pharynx and an extended finger inserted into the glottis. The bevel of the ET tube techniques for research purposes such as biopsies and transmitter implantation rather than on clinical case management. Typical or routine surgical procedures are expected to vary with institutional mission and animal use. In permanent collections, elective (nondiagnostic or therapeutic) surgeries are limited. Some facilities routinely castrate male pinnipeds, and this may be the most common elective surgical procedure performed. The author' s preferred method for bilateral orchidectomy is a single prescrotal incision and closed technique as described for domestic dogs. Methods for both subcutaneous and intraabdominal device implantation, including observations of species differences in results, have been described. 26, 36 Various non-elective surgical procedures for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes have been reported in the literature or described in conference proceedings. Ophthalmic surgery and dental surgery are the most commonly performed surgical procedures in most permanent collections, followed by biopsy of masses and other lesions. In rehabilitation settings, it appears that surgical incision and drainage of abscesses, with or without indwelling drain placement, is very common, along with debridement of traumatic wounds (shark bite wounds, blunt force trauma, gunshot trauma, conspecific trauma, etc.). Numerous orthopedic surgeries have been performed, but in the author' s experience, most orthopedic surgeries are salvage procedures such as amputations and arthrodeses. Indications for GI surgeries are fewer than in terrestrial animals. The most common appears to be foreign body removal. Most GI foreign bodies do not pass the gastric pylorus, as discussed previously (the walrus, again, the exception here) and may be retrieved under endoscopic guidance per os, precluding the need for laparotomy or laparoscopy. However, laparoscopy and laparotomy are easily performed on most small pinnipeds by using methods described for dogs, and although indications for each exist, a laparoscopic approach is preferred when possible. This author has successfully performed biopsy of the diaphragm, liver, kidney, intraabdominal lymph nodes, neoplastic masses, and other lesions under laparoscopic visualization in both phocid and otariid patients. 7",

The application of postoperative bandages-to facilitate tissue stabilization and hemostasis or to reduce dead space by compression-is occasionally helpful but must be weighed against the disadvantages of bandaging a pinniped. Overnight bandaging should be considered when hemostasis or dead space reduction is required, for example, following major amputations; however, in general, providing access to water as soon as possible following surgery is preferred over \"dry docking\" the animal. These animals appear to be most comfortable and rest best when allowed access to water. If restricted from water, they frequently appear anxious and do not rest, which increases the risk of heat prostration. They also are prone to soiling the surgical incision sites with feces and urine; if the animal is misted or hosed to provide cooling, the bandages become wet anyway. It is often very difficult to fashion a bandage that will effectively stay dry and stay in place on an animal' s appendage or trunk. Veterinary ophthalmologists and dentists will frequently recommend \"dry docking\" the animal for up to several weeks postoperatively. In this author' s experience, complications of wound healing are much reduced when animals are allowed access to water within 24 hours of surgery, if not immediately.",

Pinnipeds appear to possess a remarkable propensity for wound healing. Major soft tissue wounds that do not allow for primary frequently be higher than expected in similar-sized terrestrial animals; values into the 70 to 80 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) range are not uncommon in uncomplicated anesthesia events. The clinician should resist the temptation to drive these down but rather watch trends over time closely and ensure that ventilation-perfusion mismatch is not developing from positional atelectasis. Otariids will usually spontaneously ventilate well and may be easily and effectively maintained by periodically assisting a breath and \"sighing\" to a positive pressure of 20 to 25 mm Hg. However, obese animals often do not effectively ventilate and should be controlled with mechanical means. Healthy pinniped lungs tolerate higher positive inspiratory pressures than by those of terrestrial animals. They are normally exposed to incredible transthoracic pressures during diving. Caution should be used in animals with presumed pulmonary parenchymal disease such as verminous pneumonia, as bullae, mediastinal and subcutaneous emphysema, and, less frequently, pneumothorax may be induced.",

When in doubt, conservative reconstruction and diligent monitoring for complications should always be considered before more radical attempts at repair or euthanasia. Massive soft tissue injury will often granulate, contract, remodel and reepithelialize at an impressive rate (Figure 44-6 ).",

Verminous pneumonia is a widespread, well-recognized, and debilitating condition in many young pinnipeds. In contrast, ova, larvae, or adults are often found incidentally during diagnostic workups. The astute clinician will evaluate the weight of evidence that these organisms are involved in the disease process against the potential for an adverse response to treatment. Anthelmentic administration to an animal in poor condition with a substantial lungworm burden, for instance, may incite a fatal inflammatory response. In rehabilitation settings, animals destined for release will be reexposed and presumably reinfected following diagnosis of pregnancy may be difficult in early gestation. Pregnancy usually results in only one offspring; twins are rare. In managed collections, the reduction of environmental and nutritional stressors may lead to earlier reproductive maturity than in the wild. Two-year old sea lions have sired pups. Contraception may be accomplished by surgical, social grouping, or chemical means. The use of depot formulations of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs in adult pinnipeds has resulted in local site reactions. Surgical contraception in females by laparoscopic ovariectomy is feasible in most species but is not commonly performed. The application of advanced reproductive technologies such as hormonal control of cycles and artificial insemination appears to be uncommon in pinnipeds, with the possible exception of walruses. Some work has been done by at least one group to manipulate both male and female reproductive cycles of walruses with the aim of increasing pregnancy rates. 51",

Epileptic animals are not candidates for release from rehabilitation centers; they do not make attractive display animals and are generally euthanized. In utero exposure and intoxication of the pups of pregnant dams may lead to serious neurodevelopmental disorders. Pups presumably exposed in utero have developed seizure disorders later in life, and some evidence indicates that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is disrupted in intoxicated animals. 27 It is possible that many yearling-class pinnipeds that present to rehabilitation facilities have cognitive or other neurologic deficits as a result of in utero exposure to domoic acid and that this has contributed to their failure to thrive.
