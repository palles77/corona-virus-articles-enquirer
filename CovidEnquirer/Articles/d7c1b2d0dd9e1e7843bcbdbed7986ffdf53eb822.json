Two fragments exhibited both antiviral and antibacterial activities, two fragments only antiviral activity, and one fragment showed no antimicrobial activity. One of the former oligopeptides showed antiviral activity against human herpes simplex virus type 1 and bovine parainfluenza virus type 3. It consisted of the hexapeptide Y-F-Y-N-A-K corresponding to amino acids 21-26 of intact aprotinin. An identical synthetic pcptide had the same antiviral spectrum as the natural hexapeptide, exhibited no antibacterial activity, and was also devoid of trypsin inhibiting activity. Intact aprotinin, in contrast, is ineffective against human herpes simplex virus 1 and bovine parainfluenza virus 3 but possesses antibacterial properties against several bacterial species [(1992) J. Appl. Bact. 72,[180][181][182][183][184][185][186][187].",

HSV-1 replication is inhibited by the peptide in both RD and VERO cells if the same multiplicity of infection, specific for the cell, was used. In addition EHV-1 replication was not inhibited either on EHL or on VERO cells at different multiplicities of infection.

The short oligopeptide, which corresponds to its active site and inhibits proteinases, also inhibits viral multiplication of HSV-1 as does the parent molecule. This suggests that proteinase inhibition could be the underlying mechanism in that system. The cystatin-and aprotinin-derived peptides may have similarities concerning their site and chronology of action in the virus replication cycles. This is suggested by the dependence of observed antiviral activity on the order of addition of virus vs. oligopeptide in both cases. As a prerequisite for antiviral activity, the virus had to be applied to the cells 1 h before the respective peptides were added. Since preincubation of viruses with oligopeptides did not affect viral infectivity, we can also conclude that the aprotinin-and cystatin-peptides do not function as defensins, i.e. by directly neutralizing viruses [19] . Another feature common to both the cystatin and aprotinin oligopeptides is their requirement for prolonged incubation (> 1 h) in the virus-cell system before suppressing viral activity. This, plus the fact that simultaneous addition of the virus and oligopeptide to the cells did not suppress infectivity, indicate that the oligopeptide does not compete with the virus for receptor sites on the cell surface. Successful inhibition of viral activity occurred only when the respective oligopeptide was added after virus adsorption and internalization and was continually present in the system. How the oligopeptide functions to inhibit viral replication remains unknown. It is possible that viruses alter the cell surface thereby providing new binding sites, or that they stimulate uptake of exogenous material by the cells. Such speculations have yet to be tested as possible interaction mechanisms.",
