At these resolutions, also referred to as \"nearatomic\" resolution, it is possible to infer all-atom structures de novo. The ability to do this of course depends highly on the overall resolution of the data. Since map resolution can vary significantly, we describe here map resolution broadly in terms of map features (Fig. 1) . At high resolution (roughly, 3.5 \u00c5 or better), sidechains are clearly visible in maps and individual rotamers may be distinguished. Generally, at this resolution the topology of the protein is unambiguous. At medium-high resolutions (3.5-4.5 \u00c5 ) only some sidechains (generally aromatics) are visible. Beta strands are separated, but the topology may be ambiguous as the density corresponding to connecting loops may be difficult to resolve. At medium resolution (4.5-6 \u00c5 ), helices are discernable, but individual beta strands are often no longer separated. The overall protein topology is often quite difficult to determine at this resolution. Generally speaking, at high-resolution, de novo map interpretation is relatively straightforward; at medium-high resolution it is possible but often difficult and error-prone, and at medium-resolution, it is generally not possible.",

Consequently, a wide variety of approaches and strategies have been developed to deal with the limited resolution of the cryoEM data. A number of different tasks arise in the process of structure determination from a cryoEM reconstruction, including de novo model building, model optimization, and model validation. Broadly speaking, tools to address these tasks have been derived from two sources. The first source is tools developed initially for X-ray crystallographic model building and optimization that have been adapted for cryoEM reconstructions. The second source is tools that have been developed directly for cryoEM reconstructions and have been targeted for the near-atomic resolution maps that have become available. In both cases, there is a wide range of tools available for each of the three steps of structure determination.",

Additionally, each section will also present some of the tools for gleaning structural insights at medium (4.5-6 \u00c5 ) resolutions, though this resolution is generally beyond that for which a model may be determined to atomic-level accuracy. Each section will describe one of the three major steps in cryoEM structure determination, corresponding to the blocks in Fig. 2 . The first step, de novo structure determination, describes how an initial model may be constructed given only a primary sequence and a reconstruction, when no other or limited structural information is known. In the second step, model optimization, we describe a broad class of methods to improve the fit of a model to data and improve the geometry of a model. Finally, we describe tools for model validation, which attempt to quantify the overall accuracy of a model given a reconstruction.",

Segmentation divides the map into submaps which Fig. 2 An overview of three steps of atomic model determination from near-atomic resolution data. (Left) De novo building methods take primary sequence and map, and automatically produce a backbone model with sequence registered, identifying which regions in the map correspond to particular sequences. (Center) Model optimization takes an initial model-either produced from de novo building, or from a highresolution homologue-and optimizes the coordinates to better agree with the map, as well as adopt more physically realistic geometry. (Right) Model validation aims to assess-both globally and locally-the accuracy of a model, given experimental data. Such tools are useful not only for assessing overall accuracy but also for tuning parameters of optimization. each contain one polypeptide or one nucleic acid chain. There are several tools available for automatic, model-free segmentation, such as the program Segger (Pintilie, Zhang, Chiu, & Gossard, 2009; Pintilie, Zhang, Goddard, Chiu, & Gossard, 2010) . However, such approaches perform inconsistently, with errors arising from either nonuniform resolution throughout the map, which makes segmentation difficult, or from tightly intertwined subunits, in which the protein-protein interfaces are indistinguishable from protein cores. For the remainder of this section, we will assume segmentation has been determined, or that we are performing \"segmentation through interpretation,\" that is, using the building of a multichain model to provide segmentation of the cryoEM map. An interesting example of the latter arose in the epsilon 15 bacteriophage: model building of the major coat protein into the cryoEM map led to discovery (and corresponding segmentation) of a second, previously unknown, coat protein (Jiang et al., 2008) . Some de novo model building, particularly at the highest resolutions, directly uses tools originally developed for X-ray crystallography. One of the most widely used crystallographic tools for structure determination in cryoEM reconstructions is COOT (Emsley, Lohkamp, Scott, & Cowtan, 2010) , a system for model building and real-space refinement into density maps. It displays maps and models and has a variety of tools-accessible through an interactive GUI interface-that allow for building of backbone into density, assignment of sequence to backbone, rotamer building, and real-space refinement (Brown et al., 2015) . However, the process is largely manual, and consequently, determining atomic structure from cryoEM density can be labor-intensive.",

The two programs differ in implementation details but both attempt to find \"seed placements\" of either helices or strands, extend these seeds guided by density, then finally place sequence on these seed placements.

Unlike crystallographic model-building programs, this approach combines the steps of backbone placement and sequence determination, and makes use of predicted backbone conformation to enable sequence registration in maps where sidechain density is ambiguous. Seed fragments are placed-not based on ideal helices and strands-but rather based on predicted backbone conformations given local sequence. The correct placements are selected using Monte Carlo sampling with a score function that measures the consistency of a set of placements. The approach is then iterated-fixing fragments previously placed-until at least 70% of the structure is rebuilt. In a benchmark set of nine maps ranging from 3.1 to 4.8 \u00c5 resolution, six structures were completely interpreted using this approach.

It nearly automatically determines plausible topologies as an instance of the travelling salesman problem (TSP): \"pseudoatoms\" are placed into a map corresponding to regions of high density, then a TSP solver finds a minimal path through these pseudoatoms, where the cost function is related to the deviation from the ideal C\u03b1-C\u03b1 distance. On a wide variety of cases-even as low as 6 \u00c5 resolution-this approach successfully determines the topology of a protein (Baker, Rees, Ludtke, Chiu, & Baker, 2012) . Several benchmark examples of cryoEM maps drawn from EMDB have been used to demonstrate its applicability and relative accuracy for modeling their protein components (Baker et al., 2011) . Fig. 4 shows the case of a rotavirus capsid protein map where the topology trace is very accurate and most errors in the C\u03b1 positions occur where the map is not as well resolved. Of note, this method does not directly use any sequence and/or protein topology information apart from the number of amino acids in the protein and the ideal C\u03b1-C\u03b1 distance. Not even the cryoEM density is explicitly used to limit topological assignment. As such, subsequent optimization of an initial pathwalker model by COOT, Rosetta, or phenix is needed to improve overall model quality. Pathwalker, distributed with EMAN2, now offers improved de novo modeling performance with the incorporation of density filtering, geometry filtering, improved pseudoatom placement, automatic secondary structure element assignment, and iterative model refinement from a fully automated command-line utility (Chen, Baldwin, Ludtke, & Baker, 2016) .",

For instance, the inositol-1,4,5trisphosphate receptor (IP3R1), a tetrameric cation channel, has 10 discrete structural domains arranged over 2750 amino acids per polypeptide chain (Fan et al., 2015) . Among these domains, only $600 residues have a corresponding high-resolution crystallographic structure. Building a model of such a large protein (Fig. 5) requires the use of a cocktail of modeling methods including sequence prediction (Cole, Barber, & Barton, 2008; Kelley & Sternberg, 2009) , secondary structure element localization (Baker et al., 2007) , homology modeling (Topf, Baker, Marti-Renom, Chiu, & Sali, 2006; Webb & Sali, 2014) , rigid body and flexible fitting (Jiang et al., 2001; Pettersen et al., 2004; Wriggers & Chacon, 2001) , and de novo modeling Baker, Rees, et al., 2012; Emsley et al., 2010) . As such, modeling of these types of complexes requires a more complex strategy that integrates the various software packages and utilizes other structural data.

Specifically, this step aims to optimize protein coordinates to minimize a target function E \u00bc E geom + w \u00c1 E data , where E geom assesses the geometric goodness of a model, E data assesses model-map agreement, and w is a weighing factor controlling the relative contributions of geometry and agreement to data in optimization.

Consequently, these methods may vary quite a bit in terms of recommended resolutions, magnitude of movements, and runtime of the corresponding approaches.

In using these crystallographic tools, the data are first processed as if it were crystal data, assigning an artificial unit cell and symmetry to the data, and computing reciprocal space intensities and phases from the realspace density. Then, refinement is carried against a function that takes into account both Fourier intensities and phases of the data. The geometry function used by both is a relatively simple macromolecular energy function that takes into account stereochemistry and steric clashes, with optional support for torsional potentials or user-defined \"restraints.\" Generally, function optimization consists of cycles of minimization, but may also include discrete rotamer optimization or cycles of simulated annealing. Consequently, these refinement methods are fast, but tend to make relatively small motions from the starting model, leading to a small \"radius of convergence\"; that is they are unable to correct errors in the starting model of large magnitude.

Alternately, some approaches make use of \"reference-model restraints,\" where atom-pair distances or torsions from a related high-resolution structure are applied, rigidifying the structure during the course of optimization . In this way, refinement fills in ambiguity in the experimental data by enforcing agreement with high-resolution crystallographic data of a related structure. In both approaches, one can think of the restraints as adding additional restraints into E geom in the equation above.",

Similar advantages in real-space optimization arise when optimization is carried out with only partial models. This effect may be ameliorated by masking relevant regions before converting the data to reciprocal space, but this requires that a mask be defined a priori. Much like the crystallographic methods, these approaches also need methods to deal with the relatively low resolution of the data, typically using the same additional terms outlined earlier, improving the sensitivity of E geom .",

This allows for optimization to move the structure significantly while energetically favorable interactions are maintained. Rosetta-based optimization makes use of a combination of minimization and Monte Carlo sampling of both backbone and sidechain conformations, where extensive minimization after each Monte Carlo sampling step allows exploration of a relatively large portion of conformational space. A complete asymmetric unit was analyzed, but the number of amino acids varies due to resolvability in the density map (EMDB6000).

            "text": "This sampling and energy function allow for larger conformational changes during optimization, however, it also comes at increased computational cost. One further advantage of Rosetta is the symmetric degrees of freedom are explicitly represented rather than restrained with noncrystallographic symmetry restraints. This further reduces degrees of freedom as well as improving performance on very highly symmetric systems (for example, icosahedral viral capsids). An example of the types of movement that may be obtained from this optimization protocol is shown in Fig. 6 . Another tool, DireX (Schroder, Levitt, & Brunger, 2010) , uses ideas from crystallographic refinement methods as well, but instead is applied in real space, and-to address the poor data-to-parameters ratio of typical crystal refinement-makes use of reference model restraints. However, unlike typical crystallographic refinement programs, these restraints are allowed to change during the course of model optimization. The restraints very slowly adapt to the current model in the course of model optimization, with two metaparameters describing the \"stiffness\" and \"speed\" at which these constraints adapt. By exploring the results of refinement over various settings of these metaparameters, an optimal setting may be identified. A key advantage of these adaptable constraints is that they identify a \"minimally perturbed conformation,\" only violating constraints in the initial model if there is sufficient evidence from the data that these constraints should not hold. Consequently, the approach can allow for relatively large motions during optimization and often works reasonably well at low resolution if a corresponding high-resolution structure is known (Chen, Madan, et al., 2013) . Fig. 7 illustrates an application of this approach in the determination of several different forms of F-actin refined against cryoEM data (Galkin et al., 2015) . Another class of tools is based on molecular dynamics guided by experimental data. The most commonly used tool is MDFF (Trabuco, Villa, Mitra, Frank, & Schulten, 2008) , which combines the VMD molecular dynamics package with a score term assessing the agreement of a model to real-space density. Like Rosetta, the rich, physically realistic force field makes the approach well suited to modeling large conformational changes, as it maintains physically realistic geometry. One weakness of this approach is that it may be time consuming, particularly if explicit solvent molecules are used, due to the increased number of interactions introduced by explicit A B C Fig. 7 An example of model optimization using DireX to model distinct conformational states of F-actin from a 4.8 \u00c5 cryoEM map (Galkin, Orlova, Vos, Schroder, & Egelman, 2015) .

Even though the data are of relatively low resolution, DireX attempts to maintain as many contacts as possible during refinement. solvent molecules and the long equilibration time consequently necessary. However, it may be parallelized to run in a reasonable amount of wall clock time. To date, it is often preferred for modeling large conformational changes subject to medium-resolution density maps, as in the ribosome (Trabuco et al., 2008) and HIV capsid (Zhao et al., 2013) . Finally, FlexEM is another method that approaches the problem hierarchically (Topf et al., 2008) . A protein system is first broken into rigid bodies, which are refined, and then full flexibility is allowed. The score function used is similar to that of crystallographic force fields, however, the initial rigid-body refinement step has relatively few parameters, and thus allows for large motions of the system.",

Alternately, one may want to compare models to find the most accurate, either to select models from stochastic refinement trajectories, or to tune parameters of model building, such as the weight on the experimental data in refinement.

While the agreement of model to data used in fitting is informative, it does not identify overfitting, fitting to noise in the original reconstruction. To identify overfitting, independent data are required (DiMaio, Zhang, Chiu, & Baker, 2013) . This is critically important at near-atomic resolutions, as-at these resolutions-it is much easier to trace models incorrectly that fit the data well.

More specifically, it looks at certain geometric features of a model and compares them to the expected values of such features, as derived from very high-resolution crystal structures. Such features include bond-length and bond-angle distributions, backbone torsional distributions (specifically, counting the number of \"allowed\" and \"favored\" backbone dihedrals, which are seen in <2% and <0.05% of residues in high-resolution structures, respectively), sidechain rotamer distributions (counting the number of rotamers seen with <0.3% frequency in high-resolution structures), and atom pairs closer than the sum of their van der Waals radii. For each metric, a corresponding Z-score is computed, and linear regression is used to compute an aggregate score. This aggregate score is trained to predict the resolution of data at which a particular structure was solved using only the geometry of the model itself. The resulting \"MolProbity score\" can very loosely be thought of in terms of map resolution, where models scoring under 2 are of high quality, while models scoring higher than 4 are of relatively low quality. MolProbity reports also describe the ranking of the examined structure relative to all the other structures in the PDB determined at the equivalent resolution (Table 1) .",

This measure is often computationally corrected during the reconstruction process, and so an assessment measure that ignores this is preferred.

All compute a \"free FSC\" analogous to the R free measure in X-ray crystallography: the agreement of model and map on a subset of data held aside during refinement. In crystallography, the R free measure omits a subset (generally 5-10%) of reciprocal space intensities from refinement and evaluates their agreement to the model as refinement progresses. Since it is now a common practice to produce two independent maps from two independent sets of raw particle images to assess map resolution (Chen, McMullan, et al., 2013; Henderson et al., 2012) , one can generate two independent models from the two independent maps. These two independent models can be compared against the two maps by either FSC or variance of the backbone between the two models (Rosenthal & Henderson, 2003) . In addition, one can compute the FSC between the model derived from one map relative to the other independently determined map (Wang et al., 2014) . It has been shown that FSC equal to 0.5 is a practical measure of the agreement between the model and map. If this measure exceeds the gold standard map resolution (Henderson et al., 2012; Scheres & Chen, 2012) , it would imply that the model is overfitted. These multiple crosschecks should provide consistent results to assure that the model is not overfitted in each case. Fig. 8 shows an example application of this model validation metric in the 3.8 \u00c5 cryoEM structure of brome B A Fig. 8 Model validation of a 3.8 \u00c5 cryoEM map of brome mosaic virus (EMDB6000) (Wang et al., 2014) by (A) deviation between two independent models at the C\u03b1 level (PDB 3J7M and PDB 3J7N). (B) FSC between model and experimental map from two independent data sets. These figures are reproduced from Wang, Z., Hryc, C. F., Bammes, B., Afonine, P. V., Jakana, J., Chen, D. H., et al.

Hryc. mosaic virus (Wang et al., 2014) . This validation approach is additionally informative for tuning the relative weight of experimental data and geometric data during the optimization process. It is very much analogous to the R free measure in X-ray crystallography: the agreement of model and map on a subset of data held aside during refinement. To deal with the somewhat reduced resolution, it is also proposed to perform additional refinement against the reconstruction of the entire data set (Brown et al., 2015) , however, this final refinement is no longer independent with respect to the \"independent map.\"",

It measures whether density is rotameric for a particular sidechain, that is, by looking along the C\u03b1-C\u03b2 vector of each residue, and identifying if the putative C\u03b3 peak is rotameric. In doing so, it ignores whether the modeled sidechain is actually rotameric. Instead, it identifies backbone placements where sidechain density seems reasonable; incorrectly placed backbone will have nonrotameric sidechain density, even if the modeled sidechain is rotameric. Important to note is that this measure only depends upon the placement of backbone atoms, and it can be thought of as an orthogonal measure to those above.",

However, as X-ray crystallographic methods show us (Terwilliger et al., 2012) , it is difficult to do this for two reasons: it introduces a significant number of parameters to optimization, and it is difficult to separate out the effects of uncertainty from conformational variability. An open challenge in future years remains how to represent and validate the various conformations possibly seen in different frequencies in a single molecular machine.",

            "text": "Finally, with the relatively low resolution of cryoEM reconstructions compared to those in crystallography, it is important to assess the accuracy of computed models. This is commonly done in several ways: by exploring the space of solutions consistent with data , by looking at consistency in models fit to independent datasets (DiMaio et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014) , and by explicitly fitting models that contain uncertainty (Pintilie, Chen, Haase-Pettingell, King, & Chiu, 2016) , essentially putting error bars on generated models. The question is still an open one; however, as there is no consensus on the best way to compute or to represent uncertainty of a model given a reconstruction. So far, all the modeling is based on the assumption of the density map being correct and having an isotropic resolution. It has been shown in numerous cases that resolutions are nonuniform throughout the map. It will be very important in the future to explore this problem more rigorously. Accounting for the uncertainty of the model and the map is key to interpreting the biology of the corresponding system and planning next set of experiments based on the structures.",

The model is of the entire tetramer with 85% chain connectivity per chain, partly due to the presence of isoforms at the SI, SII, and SIII sites causing specimen heterogeneity and partly due to the limited map resolution.
