Improved motor skills were associated with a reduction in neuroinflammation, decreased demyelination, and enhanced remyelination. Evidence indicates that the reduced neuroinflammation is correlated with an increased number of CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 + regulatory T cells (Tregs) within the spinal cords. Coculture of hNPCs with activated T cells resulted in reduced T cell proliferation and increased Treg numbers. The hNPCs acted, in part, through secretion of TGF-b1 and TGF-b2. These findings indicate that the transient presence of hNPCs transplanted in an animal model of MS has powerful immunomodulatory effects and mediates recovery. Further investigation of the restorative effects of hNPC transplantation may aid in the development of clinically relevant MS treatments.",

The demyelination is progressive over time; however, spontaneous, but transient, myelin repair can occur during the course of the disease. Endogenous oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are believed to be responsible for spontaneous remyelination (Lassmann et al., 1997) , but it is unclear why these cells only act intermittently. An important unmet clinical need for MS patients is an effective method to induce sustained remyelination.",

Studies in animal models have demonstrated the benefits of cell therapy in treating mouse models of MS. For example, myelin generation (Buchet et al., 2011) , accompanied by modulation of inflammatory responses, followed CNS transplantation of human neural precursor cells into animal models in which myelin formation is defective or demyelination is induced via immunization with encephalitogenic peptides. Another model, which we employed in this study, is based on findings that persistent infection with a mouse neurotropic coronavirus correlates with chronic neuroinflammation and immune-mediated demyelination (Lane and Buchmeier, 1997) .",

We observed clinical recovery associated with muted neuroinflammation and decreased demyelination, along with emergence of CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 + regulatory T cells (Tregs) . Ablation of Tregs in hNPC-transplanted mice inhibited the improvement in motor skills and increased neuroinflammation and in vitro, hNPCs modulated cytokine secretion and proliferation by antigen-sensitized T cells.

An important modification was cell passaging to control cell density during the 9-day-directed differentiation protocol, and the transplanted cells had a uniform cellular morphology (Figure 1A) . Because there is considerable phenotypic diversity among preparations of neural precursor cells (M\u00fcller et al., 2008) , we performed extensive microarray-based transcriptome analysis to define a genomic phenotype for the cells that showed clinical activity. The microarray analysis revealed a consistent profile of gene expression among separate populations of hNPCs differentiated by our method ( Figure 1B ; Table S1 available online).",

Analysis of spinal cords from hNPC-transplanted mice at 21 days pt revealed a marked reduction in inflammatory cells present within spinal cords compared to the controls. Clinical recovery following hNPC transplantation is associated with reduced neuroinflammation in the spinal cord ( Figure 2A ). Immunostaining for activated macrophage/microglia and T cells (Figures 2B and 2C) , critical in amplifying the severity of demyelination in JHMV-infected mice, revealed an overall reduction in immunoreactive cells within the spinal cords that was sustained past 175 days pt.

Quantification of macrophage/microglia and T cell immunostaining indicated that hNPC transplantation resulted in a significant (p < 0.01) reduction in both cell populations compared to control mice ( Figure 2D ). Flow cytometry analysis confirmed immunostaining by showing reduced infiltration of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells into the CNS of hNPC-treated mice compared to controls (Figures 3A and 3B) . Accumulation of virus-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in the CNS of hNPC-treated mice was also determined by tetramer staining (Zhao et al., 2011) . Infiltration of CD4 + T cells recognizing the immunodominant epitope within the viral matrix (M) glycoprotein spanning amino acids 133-147 (M133-147) and CD8 + T cells specific for the immunodominant epitope in the spike glycoprotein located on amino acids 510-518 (S510-518) were both reduced in hNPC-transplanted mice ( Figures 3A and 3B ). In addition, macrophage (F4/80 + CD45 high ) infiltration was reduced in hNPC-transplanted mice ( Figure 3C ). Analysis of viral titers within the CNS of experimental mice indicated that control of viral replication within the spinal cords was not affected by hNPC transplantation; replicating virus was not detected ( Figure 3D ), and there were no differences in transcript levels of viral RNA ( Figure 3E ).",

            "text": "Our transplantation results indicated that the short-term presence of transplanted hNPCs resulted in long-term clinical recovery and decreased neuroinflammation and demyelination. This suggests that transplanted hNPCs may secrete factors that have long-term effects on neuroinflammation and demyelination. Recent studies have shown that certain hNPCs secrete the immunomodulatory cytokines TGF-b1 and TGF-b2 and there is an increase in the frequency of CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 + T cells following coculture of hNPCs with human PBMCs (Liu et al., 2013) . Our microarray gene expression analysis identified TGF-b2 among the genes that were consistently more highly expressed in hNPCs compared to other cell types (Table S1 ). We used qRT-PCR to compare transcript levels in hESCs and hNPCs and found that the TGF-b family of cytokines was differentially expressed (p < 1 3 10 \u00c06 ) in the hNPCs ( Figure 7A ). TGF-b2 transcripts were 250-fold higher in hNPCs, whereas TGF-b1 transcripts were $5-fold higher compared to hESCs ( Figure 7A ). Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was previously shown to be associated with mesenchymal stem cell-mediated recovery in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model (Bai et al., 2012) , but our results showed that HGF transcripts were nearly undetectable in our hNPCs ( Figure 7A ). Consistent with the transcript analysis, measurement of protein levels in culture medium conditioned by hNPCs showed that there was an approximate 40-fold higher level of TGF-b2 and a 3-fold higher level of TGF-b1 in hNPC-conditioned medium (CM) compared to control medium ( Figure 7B ). Inclusion of neutralizing antibodies specific for TGF-b1 or TGF-b2 blocked the ability of hNPCs to inhibit proliferation of virus-specific CD4 + T cells, and inclusion of both antibodies had the largest effect ( Figure 7C ). In addition, antibody targeting of TGF-b1 or TGF-b2, alone or in combination, reduced numbers of CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 + T cells emerging in cocultures of hNPCs and T cells ( Figure 7D ), suggesting an important role for these cytokines in contributing to the immunomodulatory effects of hNPCs.",

Calculation of g-ratio, as a measurement of structural and functional axonal remyelination, revealed a significantly (p < 0.001) lower g-ratio (indicative of remyelination) in hNPC-treated mice (0.83 \u00b1 0.005, n = 533 axons) compared to control mice (0.94 \u00b1 0.005, n = 541 axons) at 3 weeks pt.

In MS, as in other neurodegenerative diseases, there is growing evidence that long-term survival of transplanted cells is not required for beneficial effects. A recent study (Bai et al., 2012) reported that mesenchymal stem-cell-induced recovery in the EAE mouse model and in lysolecithin-induced demyelination was dependent upon release of HGF. Although we have found that our hNPCs do not produce detectable HGF mRNA or protein, our findings are similar with regard to immunomodulation, diminished spread of demyelination, and remyelination. Additional studies also support the immunomodulatory properties associated with transplanted stem cells; in one study, intracerebroventricularly injected human glial cells rapidly died yet resulted in reduction of the clinical severity of EAE that correlated with inhibited proliferation of myelin-specific T cells (Kim et al., 2012b) . Similarly, human ESC-derived oligodendrocyte precursors did not survive past 8 days following intraventricular injection into mice with EAE, yet animals displayed decreased neurologic disability, and this was associated with increased numbers of regulatory T cells within the CNS (Kim et al., 2012a) . These reports are consistent with growing evidence that transplanted stem cells rarely differentiate into cells of neural lineage, and their efficacy often appears to be through delivery of trophic factors (Blurton-Jones et al., 2009; M\u00fcller et al., 2006) or by modulating inflammation (Neirinckx et al., 2013) .",

We believe this is possible because hNPCs had already disappeared from the spinal cord at the time we detected increased numbers of Tregs. Our results suggest that Tregs are a critical component of the recovery, because antibody-mediated ablation of Tregs reduced the clinical effects of hNPCs. We are interested in characterizing cytokine profiles within both the CNS and draining cervical lymph nodes, as recent studies argue that Treg-mediated effects in controlling neuroinflammation and demyelination in JHMV-infected mice occurs in lymphatic tissue (Trandem et al., 2010) and that certain cytokines can function in controlling Treg suppression (Zhao et al., 2011) . As it is unlikely that transplanted hNPCs were differentiating into oligodendroglia, it appears that remyelination is occurring in response to activation of endogenous OPCs through mechanisms that remain to be defined. One possible mechanism is that the transplanted cells or Tregs, or both, may secrete factors that influence maturation of OPCs.",

            "text": "Our studies suggest that direct delivery of precursor cells into the CNS via intraspinal transplantation influences clinical and histologic outcome through interactions of transplanted cells with inflammatory cells present within the CNS microenvironment, such as by affecting the emergence of Tregs. This suggests that transplanted hNPCs can manipulate the microenvironment, presumably through localized secretion of soluble factors that modulate the immune response and remyelination. Our work and the work of others (Liu et al., 2013) shows that cultured hNPCs secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines, including TGF-b1 and TGF-b2. Based on our experiments and previous reports, our current hypothesis is that the emergence of Tregs in the areas of the transplant may be due to localized expression of TGF-b1 and/or TGF-b2 following hNPC transplantation. The immunodulatory effects of TGF-b in regulating immune tolerance and T cell homeostasis are well documented (Sakaguchi, 2004) , and our findings indicate an important role for TGF-b1 and TGF-b2 in contributing to the hNPC-mediated inhibition of proliferation of antigen-specific T cells and in increasing the frequency of regulatory T cells. This evidence supports the idea that the presence of transplanted hNPCs suppresses the Figure 6 . hNPCs Modulate T Cell Responses (A) T cells were isolated from draining cervical lymph nodes of control and hNPCtransplanted mice at 3 weeks pt, stimulated with M133-144 viral peptide, and their secretion of IFN-g, TNF-a, and IL-10 was determined by ELISA after 48 hr of culture. IFN-g and TNF-a secretion was lower and IL-10 secretion higher in hNPC-treated mice. (B) hNPCs were cocultured with activated T cells at the indicated ratios, and T cell proliferation was determined by eFluor 670 staining. Results demonstrated that hNPCs suppressed T cell proliferation in a dosedependent manner. (C) Coculture of hNPCs with activated T cells either in the presence or absence of the immunodominant CD4 viral peptide (M133-147) revealed increased numbers of CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 + T cells when viral peptide was included.",

Importantly, we found that the methods used to prepare the hNPCs are critical to their functional phenotype. Human neural precursor cells are notably diverse (M\u00fcller et al., 2008) , and culture methods (Chetty et al., 2013; Nazareth et al., 2013) have profound effects on cellular differentiation. To facilitate further investigation of the cells and the mechanisms underlying hNPC-mediated recovery, we generated a genomic phenotype of the cells that can serve as a guide to define the precise cell type used in our studies.",

Images at 1,2003 magnification were analyzed for g-ratio using ImageJ software. In adult animals there is a relationship between axon circumference and myelin sheath thickness (number of lamellae) expressed by the g-ratio (axon diameter/total fiber diameter); in remyelination, this relationship changes such that myelin sheaths are abnormally thin for the axons they surround. An abnormally thin myelin sheath, relative to axonal diameter, was used as the criterion for oligodendrocyte remyelination. Absence of a myelin sheath was used as the criterion for demyelination. For most axons, two measurements were conducted with a minimum of 500 axons analyzed per experimental group. In all cases, slides were blinded and read independently by three investigators.",

The cells are closely packed and have a distinctive morphology, and the culture appears to be homogeneous. (B) Gene expression signature of hNPCs used for transplantation experiments. A heatmap shows the hierarchical clustering of 118 probes that were significantly differentially expressed (p < 0.001) in hNPCs. Five independent cultures of hNPCs were compared by global gene expression analysis (Human HT-12 v. 4 Expression Beadchip), with four samples of human pluripotent stem cells (two hESC and two iPSC lines) and a sample of human fibroblasts. The scale at right indicates the fold differences in gene expression, with yellow indicating relatively higher expression and blue indicating relatively lower expression. (C) Human fibroblasts or hNPCs were transplanted by intraspinal injection into JHMV-infected mice at day 14 postinfection. hNPCtransplanted mice improved (p < 0.05) motor skills compared to animals transplanted with either fibroblasts or vehicle alone (control). (D) Improved (p < 0.05) clinical recovery in hNPC-transplanted JHMV-infected mice was sustained out to 168 days posttransplantation (pt) when compared to infected mice treated with vehicle alone. For experiments shown in (C) and (D), the data are the results of two independent experiments with data shown as averages \u00b1 SEM.
