            "text": "Background Person-to-person transmission of respiratory pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is a challenge facing many cystic fibrosis (CF) centres. Viable P aeruginosa are contained in aerosols produced during coughing, raising the possibility of airborne transmission. Methods Using purpose-built equipment, we measured viable P aeruginosa in cough aerosols at 1, 2 and 4 m from the subject (distance) and after allowing aerosols to age for 5, 15 and 45 min in a slowly rotating drum to minimise gravitational settling and inertial impaction (duration). Aerosol particles were captured and sized employing an Anderson Impactor and cultured using conventional microbiology. Sputum was also cultured and lung function and respiratory muscle strength measured. Results Nineteen patients with CF, mean age 25.8 (SD 9.2) years, chronically infected with P aeruginosa, and 10 healthy controls, 26.5 (8.7) years, participated. Viable P aeruginosa were detected in cough aerosols from all patients with CF, but not from controls; travelling 4 m in 17/18 (94%) and persisting for 45 min in 14/18 (78%) of the CF group. Marked inter-subject heterogeneity of P aeruginosa aerosol colony counts was seen and correlated strongly (r=0.73-0.90) with sputum bacterial loads. Modelling decay of viable P aeruginosa in a clinic room suggested that at the recommended ventilation rate of two air changes per hour almost 50 min were required for 90% to be removed after an infected patient left the room. Conclusions Viable P aeruginosa in cough aerosols travel further and last longer than recognised previously, providing additional evidence of airborne transmission between patients with CF.",

            "text": "Communicable respiratory infections are an important cause of mortality and morbidity and result in healthcare costs worth billions of dollars. 1 2 The person-to-person transmission of respiratory pathogens may occur by three key routes: contact transmission, where infectious respiratory secretions spread by direct contact or indirectly through a contaminated intermediate object or person; droplet transmission, where large infectious droplets travel directly over short distances from the respiratory tract to deposit onto mucosal surfaces (eg, nasal and conjunctival mucous membranes); and airborne transmission, involving dissemination of small droplet nuclei within the respirable size range that remain infectious over time and distance and are inhaled by susceptible individuals. 3 Airborne transmission may pose a significant risk for hospital-acquired respiratory infection, 4 with evidence that it is an important mode of acquisition for many respiratory infections, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) and Bordetella pertussis. 5 6 Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lifelimiting autosomal-recessive disorder in Caucasians with most affected persons dying in their third-to-fourth decade from respiratory failure complicating chronic pulmonary infections. 7 Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common pathogen in CF lung disease, and once infection is established there is an accelerated decline in lung function, quality of life and survival. 8 9 While many patients with CF acquire P aeruginosa sporadically from the environment, molecular-typing studies show shared strains are common in some Open Access Scan to access more free content",

However, despite CF centres implementing contact and droplet transmission control measures, P aeruginosa cross-infection continues 11 13 14 and is only interrupted by implementing strict patient segregation policies. 15 16 It seems that a plausible mechanism of transmission between patients is the airborne route. Indeed, patients with CF infected with P aeruginosa produce droplet nuclei containing viable bacteria. 17 Furthermore, studies using air sampling in CF clinical settings have demonstrated viable P aeruginosa after physiotherapy and in corridors outside inpatient cubicle rooms housing patients with shared strain P aeruginosa infection. 18 19 Others have also suggested that airborne transmission is feasible, with shared and mucoid P aeruginosa strains having a survival advantage. 20 21 However, methods used in previous studies were unable to demonstrate how long viable bacteria were present in aerosols or how far they could travel from the original source. We therefore sought to enhance understanding of P aeruginosa aerosol production in CF in order to (i) determine the duration and distance of viable cough aerosols, (ii) identify the factors influencing pathogen viability and to (iii) understand the effects of room ventilation on controlling the duration of viable airborne P aeruginosa.",

The role of room ventilation as a potentiator of airborne transmission of microbes such as M tuberculosis, measles, SARS-coronavirus and varicella zoster is well documented. 4 Published guidelines for ventilation in hospitals suggest that 2 ACH of fresh (ie, non-recirculated) air are required for clinic rooms and general wards, 3 ACH are recommended for procedure rooms and 12 ACH are needed for isolation rooms. 28 29 We have previously published results of measuring ACH in various clinical locations within TPCH and found that these meet or exceed recommended levels in most cases, with an extreme example of almost 24 ACH in an isolation room in the emergency department. 25 However, the data from the present study suggest that a clinic room with the recommended two ACH may require almost an hour after a patient harbouring P aeruginosa leaves the room before 90% of the viable bacteria are removed from the air (see online supplementary methods). These data have substantial implications for CF infection control practices. Our modelling suggests that increasing room ventilation provides some benefit; however, the time required to remove 90% of potentially infectious aerosols still exceeds 10 min despite substantial increases in ACH (figure 3). A new paradigm may be needed, such as employing within CF centres advanced ventilation and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) techniques to achieve infection control, as is done for TB clinics. 30 31 This study has several important limitations. The infectious inoculum required to establish P aeruginosa infection in CF is unknown and may vary between patients. 20 Thus, it is impossible to estimate to what extent viable aerosols of P aeruginosa need to be removed to eliminate the risk of infection in susceptible patients. In many CF clinical settings, contact and droplet infection control measures have been implemented, but reduced rates of shared P aeruginosa strain infections have been reported only in centres employing strict cohort segregation based upon molecular typing surveillance. 15 It therefore remains uncertain whether these simpler measures are sufficient, and if preventing airborne transmission should also be considered when strict segregation of large patient cohorts attending major CF centres is not always feasible. 14 Our study included a small number of older patients with chronic P aeruginosa infection and moderately severe airflow obstruction. Thus, we cannot comment on viable aerosol production during coughing by younger or healthier patients or in those with transient P aeruginosa infections. In addition, we used culture media that selected for aerobic gram-negative bacteria and we cannot provide data on other microbes, including Staphylococcus aureus, non-tuberculous mycobacteria or respiratory viruses. 14 32 33 Future studies using other selective media to determine the viability of other microorganisms in cough aerosols are now required. Due to bactericidal effects, it is also possible that the bacitracin used in the culture media reduced the recovery of some P aeruginosa organisms. Finally, modelling data assume that the room air is perfectly mixed, which is rarely the case. As such, our estimates of the time taken to remove viable P aeruginosa from a clinic room may be overestimates or underestimates of real-world scenarios (see online supplementary methods).",

Indeed, airborne transmission may be a more important mechanism of cross-infection within the CF community than previously considered to be the case. Furthermore, our data add to the controversy generated by the current USA CF Foundation guidelines that only one person with CF attend a CF Foundation-sponsored or CF Centre-sponsored event 34 ; recommendations strongly opposed by some adults with CF. 35 In summary, this study indicates that when patients with CF harbouring P aeruginosa cough, they produce an aerosol containing viable organisms capable of travelling 4 m and persisting in the air for 45 min. These data challenge current CF infection control guidelines that remain in place in many parts of the world, including the separation of patients by 1-2 m to prevent cross-infection by respiratory bacteria. 13 36 Consequently, further studies on transmission are needed and infection control Table 2 Colony-forming unit (CFU) counts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from the cough aerosol cultures of subjects with cystic fibrosis (CFUs in total aerosol, and in large and small particle fractions are shown)* Total \u2021 14.6 (11.0-19.2) a 11.9 (8.9-15.7) a 7.7 (5.4-11.0) b 0.046 Large fraction \u00a7 4.2 (3.1-5.5) a 3.9 (2.9-5.2) a 2.3 (1.5-3.4) a 0.074 Small fraction \u00b6 11.9 (9.1-15.6) a 9.0 (6.7-11.8) ab 6.2 (4.3-8.8) b 0.031 *Values are means (95% CI).
