However, the molecular mechanisms governing the abnormal secretion of HS-responsive hormones, such as glucocorticoids, are not fully understood. The goal of this study was to investigate differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the adrenal glands of pigs, and to elucidate changes in the immune neuroendocrine system in pigs following HS. Through a functional proteomics approach, we identified 1202 peptides, corresponding to 415 proteins. Of these, we found 226 DEPs between heat-stressed and control porcine adrenal gland tissue; 99 of these were up-regulated and 127 were down-regulated in response to HS. These DEPs included proteins involved in substrate transport, cytoskeletal changes, and stress responses. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used to identify the subcellular characterization, functional pathway involvement, regulatory networks, and upstream regulators of the identified proteins. Functional network and pathway analyses may provide insights into the complexity and dynamics of HS-host interactions, and may accelerate our understanding of the mechanisms of HS.",

Pigs enter a state of HS when the ambient temperature exceeds their thermal neutral zone (16-22\u00b0C for adult pigs) (Coffey et al., 1995) . Due to their high production of metabolic heat, accelerated fat deposition, and lack of sweat glands, pigs there are more sensitive to HS than many other mammals (D'Allaire et al., 1996) . Heat stress in pigs not only decreases food intake and body weight gain, but also has immunosuppressive effects, all of which may result in large economic losses for the swine industry (Cruzen et al., 2015; Pearce et al., 2013) . For instance, HS is estimated to cost the US swine industry losses of over $300 million each year (St-Pierre et al., 2003) . Understanding the stress-associated mechanisms involved in immune system function and the increased susceptibility of livestock to heat-related illness is more important now than ever, as the majority of emerging animal diseases are zoonotic and can potentially threaten public health.",

            "text": "When exposed to a high-temperature environment, the central nervous system of mammals, including livestock, engages in physiological responses that result in the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympatho-adrenal axis. The predominant hormone regulating the synthesis and secretion of adrenal glucocorticoids is adrencocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (Minton, 1994) . In pigs, cattle, and sheep, both corticotropin-releasing hormone and vasopressin regulate the secretion of ACTH, suggesting that these two proteins interact to enhance ACTH secretion. ACTH acts on the adrenal gland with the circulation, it to induces the expression and secretion of glucocorticoids, which suppress the production of cytokines and other pro-inflammatory mediators, including TNF-\u03b1, interferon-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-11, IL-12, IL-8, and prostaglandins (Wilckens and Rijk, 1997) . Glucocorticoids also facilitate the release of anti-inflammatory mediators, such as transforming growth factor-\u03b1, IL-10, and IL-4, and have apoptotic effects and strong anti-proliferative properties in immune cells (Visser and Nagelkerken, 2002) . Ultimately, cytokines activate the release of glucocorticoids, which in turn suppress cytokine synthesis fin a negative feedback loop (Barrat et al., 2002; Haddad et al., 2002) . Thus, it is of interest to understand how higher core temperatures alter adrenal function.",

Subsequently, labeled peptides were combined and fractionated by strong cation exchange (SCX) chromatography (Han et al., 2015) and desalted on C18 Cartridges (66872-U; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The dried peptide mixture was reconstituted and acidified with 2 mL buffer A (10 mM KH 2 PO 4 in 25% of ACN, pH 3.0) and loaded onto a column (4.6 \u00d7 250 mm). Peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 1 mL/ min with a gradient of 0%-5% buffer B (2 M KCl, 10 mM KH 2 PO 4 in 25% of ACN, pH 2.7) for 5 min, 5-10% buffer B for 10-15 min, 10%-30% buffer B for 25-35 min, and 30%-50% buffer B for 35-50 min. The elution was monitored by absorbance at 214 nm, and fractions were collected every 1 min. The tryptic peptides were extracted, and the peptide mixtures were concentrated by Speed Vac centrifuge to dryness, and were again dissolved with 2% acetonitrile (ACN) in 0.1% formic acid before LC-MS/MS analysis.",

Together, \u03b2-tubulin and \u03b1-tubulin (Table 2 ) participate in the formation of microtubules, the integrity of which is essential for the segregation of chromosomes during cell division, the maintenance of cell shape, and the intracellular trafficking of macromolecules and organelles. Changes in \u03b2-tubulin and vimentin levels have been detected in SARS-CoV (Jiang et al., 2005) and infectious bursa disease virus (IBDV) (Zheng et al., 2008a) . \u03b2-tubulin was one of the DEPs identified in this study, and its expression was approximately 2.2-fold up-regulated in adrenal tissue under heat stress, suggesting that differentially expressed cytoskeletal proteins could promote stress response in the adrenal gland. Further large-scale studies are required to understand the roles and interrelation of \u03b2-tubulin and vimentin in porcine heat stress response.",

Several HSPs were identified as down-regulated DEPs in this study, including HSP27 and HSP60. Several members of the HSP family are expressed on the surfaces of cells; these can stimulate immune effector cells directly or can play crucial roles in antigen cross-priming. In this situation, HSPs act as shuttle molecules for exogenous antigens and can directly stimulate T cells by prompting APC cytokine secretion (Kotsiopriftis et al., 2005) . HSPs appear to play a part of the innate immune response since the emergence of phagocytes in early multicellular organisms, and were commandeered for adaptive immune responses with the appearance of immune specificity (Srivastava, 2002) .",

Mortaz found that high temperature induced mouse bone marrow mast cells to release HSP70, and the secretion of HSP70 in turn activated the Toll-like receptor 4(TLR4) pathway (Mortaz et al., 2006) . The expression of HSP70 is enhanced under stress conditions, and is generally considered to act through its role as a molecular chaperone, but recent reports indicate that HSP70 also modulates inflammatory responses by inhibiting activation of the inflammatory transcription factor, nuclear factor-kappa B (Zheng et al., 2008b) . In addition, HSP70 may directly interfere with cell death pathways, such as those involved in apoptosis and necrosis (Yenari et al., 2005) . In this study, HSP70 was up regulated(1.52 fold reduction) in porcine adrenal gland tissue under heat stress, further indicating the role of HSP70 in adrenal gland injury and highlighting its relevance to inflammatory responses.",

HSP60 can also specifically bind TLRs, especially TLR4, which is involved in human and rat atherosclerotic lesions (Grundtman et al., 2011) . HSP27 belongs to a family of small heat shock proteins, can affect protein assembly, and may also participate in protein degradation. This conclusion follows directly from data suggesting that heat stress reduces the expression of heat shock proteins, handicapping their ability to induce a protective immune response when immunocytes are confronted with foreign entities. Antigen presentation by HSPs activates the innate and adaptive immune systems to initiate an acute response to stress factors, and suppression of HSPs obstructs this response. These properties allow HSPs to be used in immunotherapy in novel ways, which could lead to a greater understanding of how heat stress modulate the immune response, and why heat stress induces immunosuppression in pigs afflicted by Post Weaning Multi-system Wasting Syndrome (PMWS).",

Phosphatidylserine (PS) is transferred from the inside of cell membrane to the outside after cell apoptosis. In the presence of calcium ions, ANXA5 has a high affinity for PS, and can specifically bind to PS exposed on cell membrane. Thus, ANXA5 specifically recognizes apoptotic cells, and acts as a novel molecular probe to detect apoptosis. ANXA5 is one of the most widely distributed and abundant members of the ANXA family, and is involved in the anti-coagulation activity, calcium channel activity, protein kinase inhibitory activity, and many other important physiological processes. ANXA5 is also closely related to inflammatory responses and cell stress (Gauer et al., 2013; Lokman et al., 2011) . ANXA1, 2, and 11, were down-regulated DEPs identified in our study. These proteins participate in cell function and maintenance, intercellular communication and interaction, cell survival and death, cell migration, neurological diseases, and other processes. Whether these down-regulated proteins are involved in the regulation of heat stress-induced apoptosis is still unclear (Gu et al., 2014) , and must be explored in further studies. Cui performed similar studies on heat stressed pig livers and found that chronic heat stress caused a reduction in the weight of the liver. They also found 45 proteins in the liver that were differentially abundant between heatstressed pigs and control pigs. Proteins found were responsible for heat shock and oxidative stress response, cellular apoptosis, metabolism, signal transduction, cytoskeleton and immune system responses. Their research found that heat caused an innate immune response whereas the voluntary diet restriction resulted in stress and cellular apoptosis (Cui et al., 2016) .",
