In contrast, non-fatal suicidal behaviour declines with age and more closely resembles suicide than in younger age groups. There are difficulties in the detection and determination of pathological suicidal ideation in older people. Multiple factors increase suicide risk ranging from distal early and mid-life issues such as child abuse, parental death, substance misuse and traumatic life experiences to proximal precipitants in late life such as social isolation and health-related concerns. Clinical depression is the most frequently identified proximal mental health concern and in many cases is a first episode of major depression. Recent studies have identified changes on neuroimaging and neurocognitive factors that might distinguish suicidal from non-suicidal depression in older people. Strategies for suicide prevention need to be 'whole of life' and, as no single prevention strategy is likely to be successful alone, a multi-faceted, multi-layered approach is required. This should include optimal detection and management of depression and of high risk individuals as available evidence indicates that this can reduce suicidal behaviour. How best to improve the quality of depression management in primary and secondary care requires further research.",

However, suicide only accounts for a small proportion of deaths in older people; in contrast it is among the three leading causes of death in those aged 15-44 [1] . Self harm was ranked 13th in the all-age global causes of death in the 2010 Global Burden of Disease study, but in old age it was ranked much lower to be 17th at age 60-64 and by age 80 years and over it was ranked 32nd [3] .",

Most research into cognitive function, however, has focussed on older people with major depression with and without a history of suicide attempts. In a preliminary investigation for a series of case-control studies, poor performance on tests of executive function, attention, and memory were found to be associated with suicidal behaviour in older people with major depression [21] . Subsequent findings distinguishing older depressed suicide attempters from those without a history of suicidal behaviour included a perception of life problems as threatening and unsolvable and an impulsive approach to problem solving [22] and a tendency to ignore past experiences and neglect outcome probability when making decisions that are overly present-focused [23, 24] . A second research group found that older depressed suicide attempters have worse cognitive inhibition performance, especially on the motor component, than their non-suicidal depressed counterparts and this inability to inhibit intrusive information may predispose to suicide attempts [25] . There is also an inability to inhibit neutral information access to working memory and delete irrelevant information which may impair the capacity to respond adequately to stressful situations [26] .",

A case-control of suicides over age 50 years found that cerebrovascular risk factor scores were significantly higher in suicide cases [29] . It is unclear whether physical illness has an independent effect upon suicide risk and studies are inconsistent about the role of specific illnesses [13] . Some physical illnesses including cancers and thyroid disorders can cause depression and these might not be detected until after a suicide attempt. Chronic pain, breathlessness and functional impairment are frequently reported health features [13] , with one study finding that the risk of suicidal ideation increased with pain severity and lack of pain control, particularly in men [30] . Psychological reactions may result in some people feeling overwhelmed by their health problems. Physical vulnerability also increases the risk that an older person will succumb to a suicide attempt. For example, an analysis of suicide attempts recorded in the National Trauma Data Bank in the United States from 1995 to 2002 found that mortality was higher in older people [31] .",

In one large population-based study from Denmark, the highest risk of suicide was in those hospitalised with a reaction to stress and adjustment disorder [42] . This is consistent with the observation that the increased suicide rate in older people in Hong Kong during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic was related to their stress over fears they would be a burden on their family [46] . Alcohol abuse is less frequently implicated in old age compared to younger suicides and often has comorbid depression [7, 13] . Personality disorders are less common in suicidal behaviour in late life compared with younger cohorts [7, 13] .

As no single prevention strategy is likely to be successful alone, a multi-faceted, multi-layered approach to suicide prevention is required. Consistent with this, an evaluation of national suicide prevention programmes in 21 OECD countries concluded that suicide rates declined after government-led suicide prevention programmes were introduced and that this was more pronounced in youth and older people [49] .",

These studies included a series of quasi-experimental studies in rural Japanese communities with high suicide rates, which involved community-based depression screening in older people and psychoeducation with follow up of screen positives by GPs or psychiatrists, demonstrated reduced suicide rates in women but not men [51] . Recently a multimodal intervention which included involvement of local government leadership, education of the general public to reduce stigma and increase awareness, training programmes for community gatekeepers and screening and increased support for individuals at high risk, was found to be effective in reducing suicidal behaviour, particularly suicide attempts in males and older people in rural areas, but was ineffective in highly populated regions [52] .",

As such, suicide prevention would not be the main focus of the strategy but rather it would be one of the potential outcomes. There is still a perception that it is 'normal' for older people to be depressed and that 'nothing can be done' about it. Two qualitative psychological autopsy studies found that suicidal older people are more likely to give warnings to relatives, but few of these warnings are passed on to health care providers and even when they are, preventive measures are not often being implemented [57, 58] . From these studies efforts to improve general population knowledge of late life depression and suicide remains a key consideration for suicide prevention.",

In terms of better understanding suicidal behaviour, work in recent years has made progress in identifying the neurocognitive differences between suicidal and non-suicidal depressed older people along with associated structural differences on neuroimaging. It is unclear whether these neurocognitive factors also play a role in suicidal behaviour in the absence of depression. This holds promise for future research.",

How best to improve the quality of depression management in primary and secondary care requires further research. Further work is also required to examine if enhancement of social connections is beneficial. Currently the Senior Connection, a randomised trial of volunteer peer companionship for older people involving community-based social services agencies and primary care practises, is underway in the United States [59] . Effective suicide prevention in a population, however, is likely to require a multi-layered multi-faceted approach. Further research is required regarding the optimal way of delivering such interventions particularly in urban populations and for males.",
