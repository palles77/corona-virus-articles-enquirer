Changes were very moderate in the liver and the lungs, and they were absent in the skin. Immunohistochemical and electronmicroscopical examination showed the proliferations to consist of endothelial and pericyte-like cells. The Australian authors likened the changes to \"neoplastic angioendotheliomatosis\" in man (Pfleger and Tappenheimer, 1959; Janda and Vanfik, 1978; Haneke and Vigneswaran, 1988; Pi&ard el al., 1988; Parent et al., 1989) , a disease which has also been described in the dog (Dargent et al,, 1988) .",

In contrast the proliferating cells in the two cats described here and in the Australian case were positive for factor VIII-related antigen and negative for LCA. This suggests a true endothelial cell proliferation. Furthermore, the histological picture and the immunohistochemical findings rather resemble those described in \"intravascular pseudoangiosarcoma of man (Kuo et al., 1976) . Pseudoangiosarcoma consists of solitary vascular knots in the skin, remains strictly intravascular and is rarely accompanied by inflammation. The histogenesis is still not clear. If it is not a neoplasm, hyperplasia of endothelial cells with a toxic aetiology should be considered. In all three cats, however, the lesions were generalized. The wide range of age in the affected cats (9 months to 6 years) suggests an infectious or toxic aetiology, as the animals were too young for a neoplasm to develop, and the lesions, had they been congenital, were too severe to have permitted prolonged survival.",

In Kaposi sarcoma, proliferations develop from vessel endothelium, but they do not remain intravascular and are accompanied by severe inflammation (Lattes, 1982) . Only the Maine Coone cat was tested for viral infection. Four weeks before death it was serologically negative for FIV, feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) and feline coronavirus (FIP).
