            "text": "Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are prevalent worldwide 1 and rival diarrhea as the leading cause of death in developing countries. 1, 2 In some impoverished urban populations in South America, ARI symptoms may be present on an almost continuous basis, making it difficult to determine symptom-free days and estimate attack rates. 3, 4 Children from these areas may spend 40% to 75% of their time with respiratory symptoms, 1,5 mostly caused by upper respiratory infections (URIs). The most striking disparity between developing and developed countries with regard to ARI epidemiology is the case-fatality rate of lower respiratory infection (LRI), mainly pneumonia, bronchiolitis, and influenza, 6, 7 in children under 5 years of age, which may reach 16% in some areas. 1, 8 Several community-based studies have established the importance of common respiratory viral infections in tropical countries 5 (Table 59-1) . In impoverished populations, these common viral infections may occur simultaneously with measles, diarrhea, and malnutrition, resulting in complex interactions of pathologic conditions that carry the potential to become life-threatening diseases. 1, 9 Unlike certain pathogens restricted to tropical areas, the respiratory viruses have worldwide distribution, efficient person-to-person transmission, and an impact on all age groups. Except for a few agents (e.g., adenoviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] coronavirus) and rare cases of extrapulmonary dissemination with other respiratory viruses, replication is generally restricted to the respiratory mucosa of humans.",

Consistent with studies in the United States and elsewhere, a study found a high burden of ARI in young, low-income children attending day care in Salvador, Brazil. 11 Few specific interventions are available to reduce the impact of respiratory viruses, 2 and the application of these interventions may be further hampered by epidemiologic patterns in ARI and socioeconomic differences in temperate, developed countries compared with equatorial regions. For example, housing conditions and crowding pose challenges for optimizing health-care strategies in the tropics. While the incidences of some respiratory viruses, particularly RSV and influenza, show seasonal trends in some tropical areas, the association of seasonal peaks of respiratory viruses in general may be less apparent where fluctuations in temperature are smaller. 12 Nutritional and educational interventions, such as reinforcing breast-feeding, 13 vitamin A supplementation for measles, 14 and facilitation of access to oral rehydration therapy, 15 may have significant effect on the morbidity and mortality due to LRI alone or in association with diarrhea.",

            "text": "Influenza viruses are pleomorphic, enveloped, with segmented negative-strand RNA genomes and belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae. Influenza viruses are distributed in three genera-A, B, and C-based on the antigenicity of the nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix protein. Influenza A virus is further classified in subtypes based on its two surface glycoproteins: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). 19 Among the 15 HA and 9 NA subtypes recognized in nature, 6 HA (H1, H2, H3, H5, H7, and H9) and three NA (N1, N2, and N7) subtypes have now been identified in human isolates of influenza A viruses. 18 However, only three subtypes of HA (H1, H2, and H3) and two of NA (N1 and N2) have caused pandemics and sustained circulation in human populations in recent years. 20 The genomes of influenza viruses contain eight RNA segments in influenza A and B viruses, and seven RNA segments in influenza C. 19 The glycoprotein HA is responsible for the attachment of the virus to sialic acid-containing cell receptors, and it mediates fusion and penetration. Proteolytic cleavage of HA by cellular serine proteases exposes hydrophobic fusion domains that mediate membrane fusion. The NA cleaves terminal sialic acid from glycoconjugates present on respiratory mucins, cells, and progeny virions. This action destroys receptors recognized by HA and allows budding virus to be released from infected cells and to spread within the respiratory tract. Influenza C virus contains a single surface glycoprotein that binds to receptor, promotes fusion of membranes, and also cleaves sialic acid. 19 Virus binding to receptor is followed by internalization into endosomes, fusion of viral and endosomal membranes, and release of the genome to the cytoplasm, from where it is transported to the nucleus. In influenza A viruses, the M2 protein serves an ion channel function that facilitates dissociation of the RNA segments from the virion interior. Transcription of the negative-strand genomic RNA into positive-strand messenger RNA (mRNA) and complementary RNA (cRNA) is mediated by a viral RNA polymerase complex in the nucleus. cRNA serves as a template for the synthesis of negative-strand virion RNA genome segments, and mRNA directs viral protein synthesis. Newly assembled nucleocapsids acquire an envelope as they bud through the cell surface. Only viruses with a full complement of genome segments are infectious. 19 Influenza A viruses are primarily viruses of aquatic birds, particularly ducks and shore birds, which harbor all subtypes recognized to date. Selected subtypes naturally infect a range of terrestrial (swine, horses, humans) and aquatic (seals) mammals; influenza B virus infects humans and uncommonly seals, dogs, cats, and swine, and influenza C virus is primarily a virus of humans. Depending on the virus type and subtype, experimental infection can be induced in mice, ferrets, chickens, swine, and primates, and the viruses can be propagated in primary cultures of kidney cells, continuous cell lines (MDCK, Vero, PER.C6, and LLC-MK2), and also in embryonated hen' s eggs. 20 The biologic property of influenza viruses to bind erythrocytes is exploited for early detection of the virus in cell culture and for the development of serologic assays by hemagglutination inhibition. 20 Influenza viruses are inactivated by temperatures above 50\u00b0C and by lipid solvents, acid, formaldehyde, ionizing radiation, and ultraviolet (UV) light. 20",

            "text": "Contrary to the remarkably sharp seasonality of influenza A outbreaks in temperate countries, seasonal patterns in tropical countries have varied between studies. In southern India 23 and Thailand 24 influenza has occurred throughout the year with sporadic outbreaks, whereas there have been consistent outbreaks in June-July and November-January, coinciding with the winter seasons in the southern and northern hemispheres, but with no apparent association with meteorologic factors. 12 In the Philippines influenza has been more frequent between November and January, 25 while in Senegal, Nigeria, and Taiwan there has been clear association with increased rainfall. 12 In southeastern Brazil, 26 Argentina, 27 as well as in South Africa, 28 seasonal outbreaks of influenza A have occurred annually from May through August (mid autumn through winter) in association with cooler temperatures but not with rainfall. Influenza B outbreaks occur periodically, yet less frequently than influenza A, in both temperate and tropical regions, 12, 20 whereas influenza C is generally nonseasonal. 20 Minor changes in antigenicity, called antigenic drift, are caused by accumulation of point mutations in the genes coding for influenza HA and NA, generating new strains that spread in annual epidemics. Influenza viruses B and C are less prone to antigenic drift. Major antigenic changes in influenza A are called antigenic shift and result in the emergence of a novel HA subtype with or without new NA to which humans lack significant immunity. 18 This may be caused by the acquisition of new gene segments through genetic reassortment in a host infected simultaneously by a human and an animal (typically avian) virus, or by reappearance of a subtype from reservoir. Swine are susceptible to both avian and human influenza viruses and may be hosts for reassortment or serve as the mammalian species in which avian viruses can adapt. Novel influenza virus subtypes generated by shift have caused catastrophic pandemics, including three in the last century. The H1N1 \"Spanish flu\" pandemic of 1918 is estimated to have caused up to 100 million deaths worldwide, 18 while the H2N2 \"Asian flu\" in 1957 and the \"Hong Kong flu\" in 1958 caused an estimated 1 to 3 million deaths.",

            "text": "Recent clusters of human infections due to avian influenza, particularly H5N1 subtype viruses in Asia, have raised concerns about new pandemic threats. In 1997 a highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus resulting from reassortment among several avian viruses caused lethal outbreaks in domestic poultry and severe illness with 6 deaths among 18 human cases in Hong Kong. The outbreak was due to exposure to infected poultry in live poultry markets and was later contained by their slaughter. This virus was transmitted inefficiently from person to person. 18, 20 In February 2003 an H5N1 virus caused deaths in a family visiting Fujian province in China. Since late 2003 wide-scale poultry outbreaks due to H5N1 virus have occurred in at least 10 Asian countries. Interspecies transmission to humans occurred in at least two countries, causing over 45 cases and 32 deaths in Vietnam and Thailand. 29 These H5N1 viruses have continued to reassort, evolve antigenically, and extend their host range with documented infections in swine and felids. Prolonged nonsymptomatic excretion in ducks and detection in migratory birds indicate that this virus has become endemic in Southeast Asia. 18, 30 An avian H9N2 virus with human receptor specificity has also spread throughout Asia in domestic poultry and pigs and caused mild disease in humans in Hong Kong and China. 18 An avian H7N7 virus caused conjunctivitis in at least 82 people and one fatal pneumonia in The Netherlands in 2003; the outbreak was contained by culling and quarantine of poultry. In February 2004 a highly pathogenic H7N3 virus emerged in domestic poultry in British Columbia with two documented human cases of conjunctivitis and mild \"flulike\" illness. 18, 29 Influenza virus is transmitted from person to person by large droplets and small-particle aerosols, as well as possibly by fomites with hand contamination and subsequent selfinoculation. The relative importance of these routes is uncertain for natural influenza. Ingestion of infected birds has led to infection by avian viruses in cats. Secondary attack rates may reach over 70% in semiclosed populations, especially among schoolchildren and patients debilitated by underlying conditions who live in relative confinement, such as nursing home residents. 20 Children play a major role in influenza outbreaks with respect to propagation of the epidemic virus in families and communities. 20",

Systemic complaints last 3 to 5 days, whereas sore throat, hoarseness, and cough, with substernal discomfort, may increase in severity as the systemic symptoms subside. Cough and asthenia often persist for 2 weeks or longer. Respiratory symptoms may be minimal or absent initially, especially in the elderly or infants. In frail elderly persons, lassitude, lethargy, confusion, lowgrade fever, and sometimes gastrointestinal complaints may be the primary findings. Influenza B tends to be milder than influenza A, and influenza C typically causes colds or bronchitis. 20 Influenza may also present as unexplained fever, croup (laryngotracheobronchitis), vomiting, diarrhea, and neurologic manifestations in young children. 31 Up to 50% of influenza virus infections in adults are subclinical. 20 Influenza causes a variety of viral respiratory complications, including otitis media, sinusitis, tracheobronchitis, pneumonia, and, in young children, bronchiolitis and croup. Secondary bacterial infections, especially pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae, are common complications and should be suspected in relapses of fever, chest pain, and cough. 20 Influenza is also associated with invasive meningococcal infections. Other complications include exacerbations of asthma, chronic bronchitis, and congestive heart failure. Myositis, myoglobinuric renal failure, meningoencephalitis, transverse myelitis, polyneuritis, parotitis, myocarditis, arthritis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation rarely occur after influenza. Reye' s syndrome occurs in fewer than 1 per 100,000 cases of influenza in patients under 18 years of age following the use of salicylates.

Tracheobronchitis is a typical feature and often associated with prolonged abnormalities in small airway pulmonary function and airway hyperreactivity. Primary influenza viral pneumonia results in diffuse alveolar damage, alveolar hemorrhage and exudate, hyaline membranes, and later reactive fibrosis. Fatal cases show pathologic changes in nonrespiratory organs, such as brain congestion and swelling, myocardial inflammation, and fibrinoid changes in arterioles. 20 Viral replication in the upper respiratory tract generally peaks within 1 or 2 days of symptom onset and, depending on age and prior immunologic experience, continues for about 3 to 8 days. The severity of illness broadly correlates with upper respiratory tract viral levels. Constitutional symptoms with influenza are due in part to the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Levels of interferon (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1), interleukins and chemokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, MCP-10, MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2) are increased in nasal secretions, and IFN, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 are increased in blood in human influenza. 20 The tissue tropism of a strain of influenza virus depends, among other factors, on a combination of susceptibility of its HA to be cleaved by, and tissue availability of proteases with specificity to cleave it, thus rendering the virus infectious. 32 Extrapulmonary dissemination of virus has been uncommonly documented in humans, but systemic spread is a regular feature of highly pathogenic avian viruses in chickens and sometimes in rodents or other mammalian hosts. Serum and secretory antibodies directed to HA and NA appear about 10 days after infection. Protection against reinfection by the homologous strain is durable following natural infection and is correlated with serum and nasal neutralizing antibody levels, principally directed against HA. Vaccine-induced protection may last for up to 2 to 3 years against homotypic virus. Infection also induces cell-mediated immunity, which is detectable 3 to 6 days after infection and seems to be important for recovery. 30 Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses against internal proteins may provide some degree of heterosubtypic immunity.",

A higher index of suspicion and laboratory diagnostics is needed outside the season, particularly in sporadic individual cases or unexplained outbreaks of febrile respiratory illness. Viral isolation from respiratory specimens can be done in several types of cells (e.g., PRMK, MDCK, LLC-MK2) and remains the current standard. 20 The presence of virus may be detected in cell cultures by hemadsorption with guinea pig erythrocytes before or after cytopathic effect (CPE) is visible. Blind hemadsorption is positive 3 days after inoculation in almost all positive samples. 20 Confirmation of isolates can be done by hemagglutination inhibition or immunofluorescence with typespecific antisera. Diagnosis can also be made in 1 to 2 days by immunofluorescence of monolayers of MDCK cells inoculated by centrifugation (shell-vial). 33 Conserved influenza antigens (M or NP) directly in clinical samples can be detected by one of several techniques (e.g., immunofluorescence [IF], enzyme immunoassay [EIA]), and multiple point-of-care kits are commercially available with turnaround time of 15 to 30 minutes. One commercial assay is based on detection of influenzaspecific NA activity. The sensitivities of these assays are higher in children (up to 90%) than in adults (generally 50% to 70%) and depend on duration of illness and sample type. 20 Several formats of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays have been used for the detection of influenza A and B RNAs in clinical samples, with the advantage of detecting genomes of noninfectious virus. 20 The time to perform RT-PCR is longer but the cost may be lower than for commercial rapid antigen detection kits, especially in developing countries. Real-time RT-PCR has enabled the development of assays that provide rapid quantitative detection of influenza A and B with high sensitivity. 34, 35 These assays have great potential to replace other methods, because they are simultaneously rapid, highly sensitive, quantitative, and amenable to being used in multiplex format, which might include probes for several different respiratory pathogens. 35 However, the costs are still prohibitive for most laboratories in developing nations. Serologic diagnosis of influenza using paired acute and convalescent serum can be done retrospectively by a variety of techniques but mainly for serologic survey purposes. 20",

            "text": "Amantadine and rimantadine are M2 ion channel blockers that inhibit influenza A virus replication at the uncoating step. 20 In uncomplicated influenza A in adults without underlying diseases, treatment with either drug can reduce the duration of influenza illness by approximately 1 to 2 days if started early, within 48 hours from the onset of symptoms. Amantadine is excreted in an unchanged state in the urine, while rimantadine is extensively metabolized after absorption and less than 10% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Elderly persons need only half the dose to achieve similar plasma levels. Amantadine or rimantadine may cause gastrointestinal upset and central nervous system side effects. Central nervous system (CNS) intolerance is more common with amantadine and, when severe, can be manifested as agitation, psychosis, seizures, and coma. Mild complaints including insomnia, dizziness, anxiety, dry mouth, anorexia, and nausea are reversible upon discontinuation. Amantadine and rimantadine are marketed as 100-mg tablets and 10-mg/mL syrup. The recommended dose is 100 mg twice daily for adults older than 65 years of age (100 mg/day for patients \u226565 years of age). For children under age 10 years, a rimantadine dose of 5 mg/kg/day (maximum, 150 mg/day) has been suggested. 20 Dose reductions proportional to the creatinine clearance (ClCr) are suggested for patients with renal insufficiency (amantadine for ClCr <60 to 80 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; rimantadine for ClCr <10 to 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). Influenza virus resistant to amantadine-rimantadine emerges in approximately one third of treated patients; such viruses are transmissible to close contacts and cause typical influenza illness. Resistance to these drugs renders them ineffective and is sometimes present naturally, including in recent human isolates of H5N1 virus. 20 The neuraminidase inhibitors zanamivir and oseltamivir inhibit both influenza A and B viruses by blocking the active site of the enzyme for cleavage of sialic acid, thus inhibiting virus release from infected cells and spread within the respiratory tract. 36 In adults and children older than 5 years, inhaled zanamivir (10 mg twice daily for 5 days) provides 1to 2.5-day reduction in illness 37 and reduces antibiotic use for lower respiratory complications by 40%. Zanamivir is generally well tolerated but may uncommonly induce bronchospasm, particularly in those with influenza and pre-existing airway disease. 20 Oseltamivir (75 mg orally twice daily for 5 days) reduces illness severity, time to resumption of daily activities by 1 to 3 days, and rates of complications leading to antibiotic prescription and hospitalization by about 50% in adults. In children 1 to 12 years of age, oseltamivir reduces the frequency of otitis media and, consequently, antibiotic prescriptions. Side effects include mild-to-moderate nausea or emesis. Dosage of neuraminidase inhibitors does not need to be adjusted for the elderly. 20 Resistance emergence is uncommon with both drugs, 20 although a recent study of children treated with oseltamivir detected drug-resistant viruses in 18%, often in association with prolonged viral excretion, and showed that children can be a source of viral transmission, even after 5 days of treatment. 38 Antipyretic-analgesic drugs may be used for influenzainduced fever and aches. Aspirin should be avoided because of its association with Reye' s syndrome.",

            "text": "Immunization with formalin-inactivated or live-attenuated multivalent influenza virus vaccines and chemoprophylaxis for influenza virus A are the methods available for preventing influenza. Influenza vaccine is used prior to the influenza season and currently includes one strain of influenza B and two strains of subtypes H3N2 and H1N1 of influenza A virus, chosen by the World Health Organization (WHO) surveillance network among the viruses most likely to circulate in the next influenza season. 20, 39 The inactivated vaccine has an approximate 70% to 90% efficacy in preventing illness in healthy children and adults. 39 It also reduces influenza-related hospitalizations and mortality in elderly and high-risk patients. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the immunization of persons aged 50 years and older; residents of nursing homes; children and adults with chronic cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, including asthma; persons chronically ill with diabetes mellitus, renal dysfunction, or hemoglobinopathies; immunosuppressed patients including those with HIV infection; children and adolescents on chronic aspirin therapy who may develop postinfluenza Reye' s syndrome; women who will be pregnant during the influenza season; children aged 6 to 23 months; those who can transmit influenza to persons at high risk, such as health-care workers and household contacts of those at high risk including children 0 to 23 months of age; crew members of cruise ships; providers of essential services; and unimmunized travelers to areas where influenza may be circulating, including the tropics, the southern hemisphere between April and September, and those traveling in large organized tourist groups. In addition, vaccine is made available to anyone interested in reducing the likelihood of becoming ill with influenza. 20, 39 The inactivated vaccine, administered as a single intramuscular (IM) dose shortly before influenza season (two doses in previously unimmunized children <9 years of age), is safe during pregnancy but should be avoided in persons with history of anaphylactic reactions to eggs. 39 Vaccine safety and efficacy in children has been extensively evaluated and has shown a favorable safety profile with efficacy in 1-to 15-year-old children of 77% to 91%. Inactivated vaccine is not currently recommended for children younger than 6 months, but vaccination of household contacts and caregivers should reduce the risk of these high-risk children contracting influenza. Healthy people aged 5 to 49 years who are not contacts of immunosuppressed patients can receive either inactivated or intranasal live-attenuated vaccines. 39 Influenza inactivated vaccine has been recently introduced in many tropical areas of the world, with a composition based on influenza viruses circulating in the southern hemisphere. The vaccine is given prior to the influenza season, which for most countries in the southern hemisphere is between May and July. 40 In South America, annual vaccination of the elderly has reduced hospitalizations and mortality for respiratory diseases. 41 Continuous surveillance has already shown that regional variations of circulating influenza virus strains should be taken in consideration in the formulation of influenza vaccines with compositions more appropriate for South America. 42 Live-attenuated, cold-adapted vaccines administered intranasally are well tolerated, genetically stable, and rarely transmissible and have the advantage of inducing local secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) responses. Because of potential interference between components, two doses may be required in young children. 20 This vaccine was licensed in the United States in 2003, where it has become an option for healthy persons aged 5 to 49 years, including those in close contact with groups at high risk and those wanting to avoid influenza. 39 This vaccine is not recommended for persons with asthma and other chronic disorders of the pulmonary or cardiovascular systems; persons with underlying medical conditions, including diabetes, renal dysfunction, and hemoglobinopathies; persons with known or suspected immunodeficiency diseases or who are receiving immunosuppressive therapies; children or adolescents receiving aspirin or other salicylates; persons with a history of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome; pregnant women; and persons with a history of hypersensitivity to eggs. 39 Cold-adapted trivalent influenza vaccine is highly effective (92% in phase 3 studies) in preventing cultureconfirmed influenza in healthy children and has provided protection against drift variant strains in some studies. In young and middle-aged adults, efficacy is generally comparable to that of inactivated vaccine. 39 Other investigational approaches have been explored in influenza vaccine development, including recombinant HA produced in insect cells, virosomes incorporating surface glycoproteins, M2 protein conjugated with hepatitis B virus core, and naked DNA encoding influenza virus nucleoprotein or HA. 20 Cell culture-based vaccines (MDCK, Vero) have been approved in Europe and may offer an alternative to the limitations of the current egg-grown vaccines. The technique of reverse genetics has been used to rapidly produce candidate vaccines against potential pandemic threat viruses.",

RSV is the leading cause of hospitalization in young children in developed and developing countries. 45 In tropical areas, RSV has been the most frequently isolated virus in hospital-based ARI studies of children. 5 AGENT RSV, the only known human pathogen of the genus Pneumovirus in the family Paramyxoviridae, is a pleomorphic RNA virus with helical nucleocapsid and lipid-containing envelope. Antigenic differences in the surface glycoprotein G permit the classification of RSV into groups A and B, each with antigenic subgroups. 46 The interaction of RSV envelope glycoprotein G with glycosaminoglycans enables adherence to the cell surface. However, G protein-independent mechanisms of attachment must exist, since mutants devoid of G protein can also enter host cells. RSV enters the cell by fusion of viral envelope with cell membranes, a process mediated by binding of the viral F protein to the cell GTPase RhoA. 46 The syncytia resulting from fusion of the infected cells to adjacent ones are the major feature of the cytopathic effect of paramyxoviruses. Once in the cytoplasm, the negative-strand RNA is transcribed by viral transcriptase into mRNAs, which then direct viral protein synthesis. An intermediate positivestrand full-length cRNA serves as a template for the synthesis of progeny negative-strand RNA. As they bud through the cell membrane, the virions acquire a glycoprotein-containing envelope. 46 RSV causes asymptomatic infection in a variety of experimental animals, but natural infection occurs only in humans and chimpanzees. 47 RSV grows well in several human heteroploid cell lines, such as HEp-2, HeLa, and A549, and is sensitive to ether, chloroform, detergents, and a pH less than 5. RSV is inactivated at 55\u00b0C, survives poorly on porous surfaces, and loses infectivity significantly by slow freezing and storage at temperatures above 4\u00b0C. 46 ",

Such has been the case in Malaysia, Hong Kong, India, Papua New Guinea, Colombia, Kenya, and The Gambia. 12 Interestingly, in Singapore RSV peak activity occurs from March to August, a period of higher temperature, higher day-to-day temperature variation, and lower relative humidity. 48 In southeast Brazil, RSV occurs seasonally, within a broader range of months from February through July, after the rainy season and when temperatures tend to be cooler, with slight variations from year to year. 49 In regions where average winter temperatures are colder, such as in S\u00e3o Paulo city and the southernmost parts of Brazil, as well as in Argentina, RSV peak activity tends to occur in July and August. [50] [51] [52] Most children have specific serum RSV antibody by age 2 years, but reinfections occur throughout life. More than one subtype of either RSV group may cocirculate in one season, with group predominance changing from year to year, without apparent correlation with clinical or epidemiologic characteristics of the illness they cause. 49,53 RSV transmission requires close contact and occurs either by large-particle aerosols or by contamination of hands and inoculation into the eye or nose. Secondary infections in family contacts of an index case are common, after an average incubation period ranging from 2 to 8 days. 45 It is estimated that 30% of all infants will have RSV infection that requires medical attention and that 2% of them will be hospitalized. 45 An estimated 10% of children will have bronchiolitis in their first year of life, with 60% to 90% of those infections caused by RSV. 54 In southeast Brazil, RSV is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections in children younger than 1 year of age and is responsible for up to 85% of hospitalizations in this age group during peak months. 52",

Fever is present in only 50% of infants. Chest radiographs may show hyperaeration of the lungs and sometimes segmented atelectasis. 45 Blood counts usually show lymphocytosis, and an increase in neutrophils with a left shift could be associated with bacterial superinfection.

Particular clinical signs are generally not accurate predictors of specific viral causes, but in a study conducted in the Philippines, wheezing was a significant predictor of viral LRI, while manifestations of higher severity, such as chest indrawing and cyanosis, were more often associated with bacterial LRI. 58 The most frequent RSV illness in children over 3 years of age and adults is URI with coryza and cough, sore throat, and hoarseness, often accompanied by low-grade fever. Exacerbations of chronic pulmonary diseases and wheezing can also be seen in adults with RSV infection. 45 The role of RSV infections in causing wheezing and asthma exacerbations in infants is well established in studies conducted in temperate areas. 59 Similar observations have been made in an emergency room study conducted in Southeast Brazil, which found that infection with respiratory viruses, especially RSV, and a family history of allergy were independently associated with wheezing. 60 Similar findings have been observed in urban Nigerian preschool children. 61 RSV has been increasingly recognized as a cause of LRI in the elderly, mainly characterized by interstitial pneumonia, prolonged cough, and dyspnea in persons with chronic pulmonary conditions, and it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of flulike illnesses. 62",

Replication in the bronchiolar epithelium causes necrosis of ciliated cells, syncytia formation, peribronchiolar inflammation with abundant lymphocytes and macrophages, and impairment of secretion clearance, resulting in small airway obstruction and the hyperinflation characteristic of bronchiolitis. Pneumonia frequently coexists, evidenced by interstitial mononuclear infiltrate, eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions in epithelial cells, and multinucleated giant cells. The most severe RSV disease occurs in young babies, whose immature airways may be unable to compensate for the pathologic changes. 46 Naturally acquired immunity to RSV is incomplete and short-lived, but the severity of illness tends to decrease with reinfections. Local secretory IgA correlates better with protection than does serum antibody level and age, and pre-existing virus-specific maternal antibodies influence the development of neutralizing antibodies. Cell-mediated immune response is central to recovery from RSV infection, and patients with suppressed cell-mediated immune response are at risk of severe RSV pulmonary disease and fatal outcome. 45, 46 The type of immune response to the virus is probably a major factor in the development of wheezing and asthma exacerbations. A bias toward a Th2 cytokine response seems to be associated with more severe disease, whereas a Th1 response leads to effective viral clearance and milder illness. The virus itself generally triggers a Th1 response, but a preexisting Th1 deficiency may be associated with disease severity in some children. It has been suggested that RSV bronchiolitis may be a marker of predisposition to wheezing or asthma later in life. 46, 63 Children vaccinated with a formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine developed in the 1960s had severe disease when exposed to natural infection, apparently as a consequence of an imbalance between protective and immunopathologic T-cell responses elicited by previous parenteral immunization with inactivated RSV. This would favor a CD4+ Th2 cytokine pattern in response to subsequent RSV infections, whereas a previous natural infection would favor a CD4+ Th1 pattern in response to reinfection. 64",

This is usually accomplished in cultures of HEp-2 cell line, in which RSV induces syncytia in 3 to 5 days. RSV antigen detection by EIA, including membrane-based EIA, is sensitive and specific and requires virtually no equipment, making it ideal for field studies. Rapid RSV detection by IF of exfoliated respiratory cells may be even more sensitive than EIA-based methods. 45, 46 The increasing use of rapid tests has facilitated the assessment of RSV in tropical areas. 1 Ideally, a combination of a rapid method with viral isolation should be used for maximal RSV detection, but the cost may still be prohibitive for the meager resources available in some tropical areas. Detection of RSV RNA by conventional RT-PCR has shown suboptimal sensitivity, especially when compared with easy-to-perform, more sensitive rapid methods. 45 However, more recently developed assays based on real-time RT-PCR are proving to be more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR assays, with the added conveniences of being rapid, quantitative, and amenable to simultaneous detection and subtyping of RSV directly from clinical specimens. 65 RSV serology has limited value for case management but may be useful for epidemiologic surveys. 45 TREATMENT URI caused by RSV requires no specific treatment, and antibiotics are needed only when bacterial otitis media or sinusitis are present. 45 The supportive treatment of infants with RSV bronchiolitis consists basically in preventing hypoxemia and electrolyte imbalance, in addition to aerosolized bronchodilators. The lack of obvious correlation between radiologic findings and disease severity suggests that a chest film should be recommended only for severely ill or deteriorating infants. 54 To prevent hypoxemia, requirements may vary from simple removal of respiratory secretions and proper positioning of the infant to mechanical respiratory assistance and even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Pulse oximetry has been advocated to assess oxygen needs, but in tropical developing areas, where oximeters may not be available, serial clinical assessment is essential to monitor disease progression. For this purpose, crackles and cyanosis seem to correlate better with hypoxemia than tachypnea and intercostal retraction. 54 Correction of hypoxemia can be accomplished with 40% or lower oxygen concentrations. 45 Oxygen should be humidified with saline and delivered by mask if head boxes or tents are unavailable. The role of corticosteroids remains unclear with some evidence that they are not beneficial. 54 The only antiviral drug currently approved for the treatment of infants with RSV is the synthetic nucleoside ribavirin, delivered by small-particle aerosol via a mist tent, mask, oxygen hood, or ventilator. It is recommended only for infants and young children with an underlying condition, such as congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis, or immunosuppression. Premature infants, infants younger than 6 weeks of age, and severely ill infants may also be considered for therapy. 66 Aerosolized ribavirin is well tolerated, but it is expensive and its prolonged administration requires facilities that may not be available in impoverished tropical areas. Passive immunotherapy with RSV immunoglobulin, in combination with aerosolized ribavirin, improved the outcome of RSV pneumonia in bone marrow transplant patients. 67 The use of RSVintravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or humanized monoclonal antibody against RSV has shown no benefit for the treatment of RSV infections in infants. 45",

            "text": "HPIVs are distributed in two genera of the family Paramyxoviridae, sharing the structural and biological characteristics already mentioned in the RSV section. HPIVs are classified antigenically into types 1 to 4, and HPIV-4 has subtypes A and B. HPIV types 1 and 3 are classified in the genus Respirovirus, while HPIV types 2 and 4 are in the genus Rubulavirus. HPIV-1 and -3 are the types most frequently associated with LRI in children, the immunocompromised, the chronically ill, and the elderly, whereas PIV-4 causes mostly URI in both children and adults. 69 Binding of HPIV to sialic acid in the cell membrane is mediated by the glycoprotein HN, which contains hemagglutinin and neuraminidase activities. Fusion of viral and cell membranes is mediated by the viral F protein, which is cleaved by cellular proteolytic enzymes. 45 Once inside the cell, the cycle is similar to other Paramyxoviridae, as summarized in the RSV section. HPIVs can be propagated in primary simian or human kidney cells and in several cell lines, such as HEp-2, Vero, MDCK, LLC-MK2, BHK, and HeLa. 69 A variety of experimental animals undergo asymptomatic infection with PIV, but only higher primates develop symptoms. 45, 69 EPIDEMIOLOGY Primary HPIV infection occurs early in childhood, and by age 5 virtually all children are seropositive. 19 An estimated one third of all viral LRIs in children in the United States are caused by HPIV-1 and -3. 69, 70 In most temperate regions, HPIV-1 and -2 cause epidemics in the fall of alternate years, either in co-circulation or alternating with one another. The biennial pattern of HPIV-1 is found in both hemispheres. 69 HPIV-1 causes most croup epidemics, whereas HPIV-2 more frequently causes illness with milder manifestations, although it can also cause croup. 69 HPIV-3 occurs endemically throughout the year, with sporadic spring outbreaks mainly among infants, and HPIV-4 occurs sporadically throughout the year in children and adults. 45, 69, 70 In tropical areas HPIVs may account for up to 15% of child hospital admissions due to LRI. 21 Community-based ARI studies in children under age 5 years show higher HPIV activity during rainy seasons in tropical countries. 3, 24 HPIVs were the most frequent viruses detected in school-aged children with bronchial asthma exacerbations in urban Nigeria. 61 HPIVs spread mainly within families and closed communities, such as nurseries, day-care centers, and pediatric wards, with high secondary attack rates. In a longitudinal study conducted with children less than 2 years of age with ARI in a day-care center for low-income families in Northeast Brazil, HPIVs represented 11% of the viruses detected. 11 The virus does not persist long in the environment and is transmitted mainly by large droplets and fomites. 45 Viral shedding usually lasts 3 to 10 days, but shedding of HPIV for months has been reported in very young children and immunosuppressed hosts. 71",

Virtually all children by the age of 3 years will have seroconverted to HPIVs, generally first to HPIV-3 but later also to HPIV-1 and -2. At school age, a significant proportion of children will have seroconverted also to HPIV-4. Secretory antibody targeted to the HN glycoprotein is the best marker of protection against PIV, 71 but the protection conferred by antibodies is limited, and repeated infections will develop. T-cell immune response seems to be involved in the clearance of virus and additionally in the development of inflammatory infiltrate, edema, and excess mucus secretion, 69 and immunocompromised hosts may develop progressive and even lethal disease. 73 Like RSV, PIVs cause mononuclear interstitial infiltrate, epithelial necrosis, inflammatory exudate into the alveoli, and hyaline membrane formation in the lungs. 45 ",

The major group includes 91 serotypes whose receptor is intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1); the minor group contains 10 serotypes whose receptor is the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR); and the remaining serotype, HRV-87, utilizes a sialoprotein as cell receptor. Unlike other picornaviruses, HRVs are acid-labile, a property that distinguishes them from enteroviruses. 77 The HRV genome is a monocistronic single-stranded RNA, packed in an icosahedral capsid composed of 12 pentamers. Surrounding the fivefold vertex, each pentamer contains a 1.2-to 3.0-nm-wide canyon that contains the receptor binding site. Following receptor binding, the viral positivestrand RNA is released into the cytoplasm and directs the synthesis of a polyprotein, whose cleavage products include an RNA polymerase. This enzyme will produce an expanding pool of positive-strand RNA using as a template an intermediate negative-strand RNA. The positive-strand RNA can be either translated into virion proteins or packaged as a genome into newly assembled virions. The HRV replication cycle takes place in the cytoplasm, and mature virions are released when the host cell is lysed. 77 HRVs are resistant to ethanol, ether, chloroform, and nonionic detergent but are sensitive to UV light; to pH lower than 5 and higher than 9; and to halogens such as chlorine, bromine, iodine, and phenolic disinfectants. They are stable for days on environmental surfaces and for years at minus 70\u00b0C. 77 HRV infects only higher primates and causes illness only in humans. Several cell lines of primate origin support HRV propagation, but certain strains of HeLa cells and human embryonic fibroblasts provide higher sensitivity for HRV isolation from clinical specimens. 78 The optimal growth temperature for HRV is 33\u00b0C to 35\u00b0C. 77",

            "text": "HRV infections occur in people from all continents, including remotely located population groups, such as Bushmen from the Kalahari Desert, native Alaskans, and an isolated Amazon Indian tribe. 79 HRV has been estimated to cause up to 80% of all autumn colds in temperate climates. 80 In tropical countries, very few community-based studies of viral ARI have used adequate HRV detection methods, 5 and this has limited the assessment of the actual impact of HRV in those areas. However, available evidence indicates that HRV is frequently associated with ARI in children in Brazil. In Fortaleza, a city in northeast Brazil, HRV detected by isolation in cell culture represented 46% of the viruses in children under 5 years of age with ARI. 3 In Salvador, another city in the same region, HRV represented 52% of the viruses detected by RT-PCR in association with ARI in children younger than 2 years of age attending a day-care center for the underprivileged. 11 Data on the frequency of HRV among adults in tropical countries are even more scarce. In Singapore, HRV was detected in 20% of the samples obtained from adults with ARI symptoms attending primary care centers. 81 HRV transmission requires close exposure and occurs mainly by hand-to-hand contact, followed by self-inoculation into the eye or nose, but also by airborne spread. Once HRV reaches the nasal cavity, infection occurs in virtually 100% of susceptible subjects, and approximately 75% of those infected develop illness after a 1-to 2-day incubation. 77 Children play a central role in spreading the virus in the household.",

Infection of a limited number of cells triggers the release of cytokines, chemokines, and inflammatory mediators, which together with stimulation of the local parasympathetic nerve endings, results in the cold symptoms. Kinins, prostaglandins, and proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines may contribute to vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, exocrine gland secretion, and nerve ending stimulation, resulting in nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, sneezing, cough, and sore throat. 77 Serotype-specific neutralizing IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies develop in most infected persons in 7 to 21 days and persist for years. Protection from infection is partially attributed to the presence of IgA antibody in nasal secretions, and recovery from illness is more dependent on cell-mediated immunity. HRV-induced blastogenesis, natural killer cell activity, mitogen-stimulated cell production of IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 have been documented during HRV infection. 77, 87 HRV induces the expression of human \u03b2-defensin 2 (HBD-2) in the respiratory epithelium, which supports a role for HBD-2 in host defense to HRV infection. 88",

The hexon and penton bases contain complementfixing, group-specific antigens common to all human adenoviruses, whereas the fibers have primarily neutralizing and hemagglutination-inhibiting, type-specific antigens. Adenoviruses are commonly accompanied by small, singlestranded DNA parvoviruses known as adenoassociated viruses, which do not seem to cause any specific disease. Most people have antibodies to at least one of the four serotypes of adenoassociated virus by age 10 years. 96 The fiber protein binds to the host cell, through the protein coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR) of the immunoglobulin superfamily, which serves as a high-affinity receptor for adenoviruses. The class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) also may serve as receptor for adenovirus 5. 94 Ligand-receptor interaction facilitates interaction of the penton base with cell surface integrins, which triggers entry. After endocytosis, the double-stranded linear genomic DNA is transported to the nucleus, where \"early\" and \"late\" sets of viral genes are transcribed, resulting in mRNAs coding for structural and nonstructural proteins. Virus assembly takes place in the nucleus, and the infectious cycle is completed by the release of up to 1 million virions upon cell lysis. 94 Adenoviruses replicate well in continuous cell lines of epithelial origin, such as HEp-2, HeLa, and A549, and can be adapted to grow in human embryonic lung fibroblasts. They are stable over a wide pH range (5 to 9), resistant to isopropyl alcohol, ether, and chloroform, stable for weeks at room temperature and for years at approximately 20\u00b0C or colder, and can be lyophilized. They are inactivated by sodium hypochlorite and a temperature of 60\u00b0C for 2 minutes. 97",

In fact, adenoviruses were discovered because of their propensity for latency in adenoidal tissue. 94, 98 In southeast Brazil, adenoviruses were detected with equal frequency in wheezing young children and asymptomatic controls. 60 Most adenoviral illnesses consist of febrile colds, and in children the fever may be high and long-lasting. Pharyngitis is common and may be associated with fever, pharyngeal exudate, granular appearance of the mucosa, and anterior cervical adenopathy, similarly to streptococcal pharyngitis. 94 Adenoviruses can be recovered from up to 20% of cases of pharyngitis in small children. Pharyngitis may be concurrent with pharyngoconjunctival fever, a syndrome caused by adenovirus types 3 and 7 and characterized by conjunctivitis, frequently unilateral, which may last for 1 to 2 weeks, preauricular adenopathy, cough, rhinitis, malaise, and fever. 99 The most frequent complication of adenoviral colds is acute otitis media, which occurs in up to 30% of cases. 100 Adenovirus LRIs consist mainly of bronchitis and pneumonia, and may make up over 10% of childhood LRIs in temperate areas. 101 Adenoviruses may cause permanent lung parenchymal damage, especially when concurrent with measles. 101 Epidemic adenoviral infections in military recruits have a spectrum of clinical manifestation ranging from colds to severe pneumonia. Typically, however, the manifestations are fever, pharyngeal symptoms, cough, chest pain, headache, and malaise. 98 Overwhelming pneumonitis may be part of disseminated adenoviral infections in newborn infants and patients with immunodeficiencies, including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). However, the frequent concomitance of other respiratory pathogens in AIDS patients and the high prevalence of asymptomatic adenovirus infection shed doubt on the causal role of the adenovirus in these patients. 102 Adenoviruses are also an important cause of epidemic keratoconjunctivitis. 94, 98 While most adenoviral ARIs are self-limited and uncommonly associated with death or permanent sequelae, 94 adenoviruses alone or associated with other pathogens have been recovered from 20% of fatal cases of LRI in Argentina. 103 ",

Recently, two groups in The Netherlands almost simultaneously published studies that resulted in the identification of two new strains of HCoV: HCoV-NL63 109 and HCoV-NL. 110 In addition, PCR primers directed to conserved replicase 1a sequences of animal CoVs led to the identification of yet another HCoV detected in 8.8% of children from New Haven, Connecticut with symptoms of ARI. This agent was designated HCoV-NH and is likely to represent the same species of HCoV-NL and -NL63. 111 On the basis of antigenic and genetic studies, the known human coronaviruses are distributed in three of the four coronavirus groups so far identified. HCoV-229E, -NH, -NL, and -NL63 belong to group I, HCoV-OC43 belongs to group II, and SARS-CoV is the only known constituent of group IV, while group III contains no known human viruses and consists only of the avian infectious bronchitis virus.",

The genome is polycistronic and the synthesis of subgenomic negative-sense RNAs is done by discontinuous transcription to originate a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs that share the 5\u2032 leader sequence and overlap at the 3\u2032 end. The envelope contains the structural proteins S (spike), M (membrane), E (envelope), and only in the case of some group II coronaviruses, HA (hemagglutinin). The S glycoprotein contains neutralizing and T-cell epitopes and functions as the cell receptor ligand, thereby determining tissue tropism. The M protein is embedded in the envelope and interacts with the N (nucleocapsid) protein during maturation. In addition to the nucleocapsid and envelope proteins, a replicase is present in cells infected by all coronaviruses. New virions assemble by budding through intracellular membranes and are released through vesicles of the secretory pathway. 108",

SARS-CoV is phylogenetically different and equidistant from all previously known coronaviruses, but isolates from different origins are relatively homogeneous genetically.

            "text": "SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) probably emerged around November 2002 in the province of Guangdong, China, where there was no serologic evidence of infection caused by this virus in sera of healthy humans sampled prior to that time. 130 At the beginning of the outbreak, many affected individuals in Guangdong were directly or indirectly involved with game trade, and indeed, palm civets and raccoon dogs from wildgame markets in the area were later found to harbor a CoV 99% homologous to SARS-CoV at the nucleotide level. This suggests that animal-to-human interspecies transmission was involved in the outbreak, providing the source of an agent that later adapted to efficient human-to-human transmission. 131, 132 Interestingly, shortly after the lifting of a wildlife trade ban that originally had been imposed to control the SARS outbreak, new cases were again detected in Guangdong, all of them caused by viruses newly introduced from animals. Since the ban was reinstalled, there have been no further naturally acquired human cases of SARS in Guangdong. 131 Remarkably, 1.8% of 938 serum samples from adults recruited in 2001 in Hong Kong tested positive for SARS-CoV antibodies, suggesting that a small proportion of healthy people from Hong Kong, as opposed to Guangdong, China, had been exposed to SARS-related viruses at least 2 years before the outbreak. 133 It is probable that SARS-CoV precursors previously crossed the species barrier and may even have caused subclinical human infection, but perhaps only occasionally this event generated strains adapted to successful human-to-human transmission. 131 SARS-CoV is mainly transmitted between humans by the deposition of infected droplets or aerosols on the respiratory epithelium. The number of confirmed secondary cases generated by one index case of SARS is relatively low, ranging from 2.2 to 3.7, suggesting relatively inefficient transmission. In addition, transmission is infrequent during the first 5 days of illness, partly because of the low viral load in respiratory secretions during that phase. For reasons not completely understood, some SARS patients, identified as superspreaders, disproportionately contribute to the generation of a high number of secondary cases. 131 Excretion of SARS-CoV in sputa and stools may average 21 and 27 days, respectively, after symptom onset, but an excretion period as prolonged as 126 days has been documented in stools. 134 Such prolonged shedding of virus in feces raises the possibility of oral-fecal transmission and, in fact, one outbreak of SARS was attributed to a faulty sewage system. 131 Case-fatality rates estimated based on cases admitted to hospital have been around 13% for patients younger than age 60 and 43% for those older than age 60 years. However, it is likely that case-fatality rates based on all infections occurring in the community would be lower. 135 Transmission of SARS-CoV among health-care workers and between patients in the hospital setting played a pivotal role in outbreak propagation. Analysis of data from initial outbreaks indicates that close contact is the most important factor leading to nosocomial transmission of this agent. Despite the lack of complete studies on the sensitivity of SARS-CoV to different environmental conditions, there have been reports of SARS-CoV persisting for up to 2 days on environmental surfaces and 4 days in diarrheal stools. 136 ",

Clinical symptoms and signs of SARS appear 2 to 10 days after exposure, and systemic symptoms, such as fever, chills, myalgia, and malaise, usually appear first. Respiratory symptoms appear 2 to 7 days later, represented most frequently by nonproductive cough, dyspnea, chest pain, headache, and sore throat. Diarrhea and vomiting may occur. Chest radiograms frequently reveal infiltrates consistent with viral pneumonitis, consisting mostly of consolidations and ground-glass opacifications. Computed tomography (CT) scans in patients with normal or equivocal chest radiograms may show unilobar or multilobar abnormalities. Fever generally subsides in 48 hours, but one or two relapses within 8 to 15 days are frequently observed. Lymphopenia with reduction of both CD4+ and CD8+ cells, slight decrease in platelet counts, prolonged coagulation profile, and elevated serum enzymes (lactic dehydrogenase [LDH], creatinine kinase [CK], and C-reactive protein [CRP]) are often observed. Around one third of patients may have CD4+ lymphocyte counts below 200 cells/mm 3 and higher susceptibility to secondary infections. Watery diarrhea with an average of six evacuations per day is common. 130, 131, 137 Radiologic worsening of the pulmonary lesions seen at admission, with or without appearance of new lesions, is a frequent observation, with development of diffuse groundglass changes frequently heralding the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Hypoxemia is noted in approximately half of the patients at around 9 days after the onset of symptoms, and a high proportion of those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), especially older males, require mechanical ventilation around day 13. Development of spontaneous pneumomediastinum during follow-up is not uncommon, probably as a consequence of ruptured peripheral lung lesions into the pleural space. 130 Prognosis is related to the level of viral replication in tissues, and patients with high viral loads in serum, nasopharyngeal aspirates, or feces, as well as those in whom virus can be detected from multiple sites, tend to have poor clinical outcome. 131 In addition to old age and severe underlying diseases, CK and CRP levels have been identified as predictors of poor outcome. 138",

SARS-CoV is detectable by RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal aspirates in only one third of patients at presentation and in two thirds at day 14. RT-PCR may be positive for SARS-CoV in stools from as much as 97% of patients at day 14, and in urine in 42% of samples at day 15. 130 Testing multiple nasopharyngeal, serum, and fecal samples increases the sensitivity of the diagnosis by RT-PCR. 143, 144 To overcome the low sensitivity of conventional RT-PCR, quantitative real-time PCR-based assays for SARS-CoV have been developed that improve sensitivity and turnaround time, allow for amplification and analysis to be done in a closed system, and thus reduce cross-contamination. In addition, the capability of the assay to quantitate viral load has contributed not only to understanding viral pathogenesis but also to predicting outcome, since high viral loads are associated with poor prognosis. 143 The ability to grow SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cell cultures was critical to identifying the agent. SARS-CoV can be recovered by isolation from respiratory secretions, feces, and urine in the first 3 weeks of illness, but the overall sensitivity is relatively low and recovery is more likely to be successful from respiratory secretions than from stools and urine. 143 Recent small outbreaks of SARS-CoV originating in laboratories 143 have heightened concern about laboratory safety issues regarding SARS specimens. The WHO guidelines for biosafety in the diagnosis of SARS (updates available at the WHO web site) recommend that propagation of SARS-CoV in cell culture for isolation or for preparation of viral stocks and cell slides be performed in biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratories, whereas handling serum and blood specimens for routine tests and serology can be performed in BSL2 laboratories. Nucleic acid extraction procedures, inoculation of bacterial or mycologic cultures, and preparation of sample smears can be done in BSL2 laboratories, observing BSL3 work practices (use of safety cabinets, sealed centrifuges, protective equipment, 5% bleach spillage decontamination, and proper waste disposal).",

During the 2003 outbreak, treatment included a broadspectrum antiviral agent (ribavirin) and immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids, aimed at reducing the immunopathologic damage to the lungs. The use of high-dose steroid therapy is controversial and for the most part supported by anecdotal evidence, whereas the use of ribavirin is based on the broad antiviral spectrum of the drug. However, SARS-CoV is only modestly susceptible to ribavirin in vitro, and therapeutic doses are difficult to achieve clinically. Since it became possible to grow SARS-CoV in culture, many potential antiviral compounds have been evaluated in vitro, but just a few have been tested in animal models and even fewer are in clinical testing. 131 Interferons (IFN-\u03b1n1/n3, leukocytic IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2) and HIV protease inhibitors were consistently active in vitro and may be considered for animal testing and clinical trials. 131 The resolution of the structure of SARS-CoV principal protease has prompted studies of the inhibitory capacity of known anti-HIV protease inhibitors for treatment of SARS. In one open-label study, a combination of HIV protease inhibitor (lopinavir plus pharmacokinetic booster ritonavir) and ribavirin was used to treat SARS patients and the outcomes were compared with historical controls treated with ribavirin alone. At day 21 after onset of symptoms, development of ARDS or death was significantly less frequent in the group treated with the combination (2.3%) than in historical controls (28.8%). In addition, peak viral loads in respiratory samples and stools were reduced in the group treated with the combination as compared with controls. 145 However, since there were differences in outcome predictors, such as sex, platelet counts, and LDH levels, between the two groups, these results should be interpreted with caution.",

Nevertheless, a vaccine for this agent would be relevant for high-risk individuals, such as workers in laboratories, hospitals, and game-animal farming. Therefore, considerable effort has been directed at developing such a vaccine. It has been shown that SARS-CoV spike protein produced in bacteria and expressed on chimeric parainfluenza virus, as well as spike protein-encoding DNA, induced neutralizing antibodies and protected experimental animals from challenge with live virus. At present, no SARS-CoV vaccine is available for human use. Therefore, in the absence of person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV worldwide, prevention of future outbreaks of SARS requires careful surveillance. The goal is to maximize early detection of new cases of SARS to implement control measures, thereby minimizing social disruption. 131 To reach this goal, the CDC recommends testing for SARS-CoV in patients who require hospitalization for radiographically confirmed pneumonia or ARDS without identifiable etiology and who have one of the following risk factors in the 10 days before the onset of illness: (1) travel to mainland China, Hong Kong, or Taiwan, or close contact with an ill person with a history of recent travel to one of these areas, or (2) employment in an occupation associated with a risk for SARS-CoV exposure (e.g., health-care worker with direct patient contact; worker in a laboratory that contains live SARS-CoV), or (3) belonging to a cluster of cases of atypical pneumonia without an alternative diagnosis (updates on these recommendations are made available at the CDC web site http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars).",

Although SARS infectiousness relative to the onset and termination of clinical symptoms has not been accurately determined, it is clear that shortening the time from onset to hospital admission and isolation reduces the risk of transmission, thus contributing substantially to curtailing of outbreaks. Identification of new cases through contact tracing played an important role in the control of the outbreaks registered so far. Stringent isolation procedures must be adopted for confirmed and suspected cases, which require a high level of alertness among health-care workers for early identification of SARS cases. The scenario may be further complicated in situations in which other diseases such as influenza and Hantavirus pulmonary infections may occur simultaneously. 135 Rates of transmission of SARS-CoV among health-care workers vary, depending on stringency of control measures adopted, presence of so-called superspreaders in the hospital, and kind of activities carried out by personnel, especially as related to proximity to the index case. Assisting during intubation, suctioning, and manipulating ventilatory apparatuses seem to be high-risk activities. While studies conducted in different settings have produced conflicting results, one study in Toronto found that up to 25% of the nurses who cared for SARS patients in critical care units became infected. 148 The presence of severe watery diarrhea may add to the challenge for the infection control team. 130 An updated set of recommendations for health-care and laboratory personnel is available at the CDC web site (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars).",

The isolates were recovered over a 10-year period in respiratory secretions from 28 children with ARI occurring in the winter time. Electron microscopy of cell culture isolates revealed paramyxovirus-like particles, and RNA sequencing revealed genome sequences and organization consistent with a paramyxovirus of the subfamily Pneumovirinae, most closely related to avian pneumovirus of the genus Metapneumovirus. Rather than an avian virus that can also infect humans, this agent is now recognized as a primarily human pathogen, and thus has been named human metapneumovirus (HMPV). 156,157 HMPV antibodies detected in sera collected in 1958 in The Netherlands indicate that this agent has been in circulation for at least 4 to 5 decades. 156 AGENT HMPV particles are enveloped, pleomorphic, spherical, and filamentous particles, with a mean diameter of about 209 nm. 156,157 Complete genome sequences of HMPV are available and, in contrast to the genomic organization of pneumoviruses, metapneumoviruses have different positioning of the genes between M and L and lack NS1 and NS2 genes. 156,158 Similar to HRSV, genetic and antigenic studies indicate that HMPV isolates cluster into two main serotype named A and B, with N gene sequences 83% to 85% similar at the nucleotide level, each subgroup including two genetic lineages (A1, A2, B1, and B2). 156, 159, 160 Both are globally distributed.

One study conducted in Finland found HMPV in 8% of wheezing children, who presented significantly higher levels of IL-8 in nasal secretions as compared to children with HRSV-associated wheezing. 174 A study conducted in Brazil found that 47% of the children with HMPV had wheezing and 31% had chest indrawing. 164 Previous history of asthma has been more frequently associated with HMPV than with HRSV infection and HMPV-infected patients are more often treated with bronchodilators and corticosteroids than HRVS-infected patients. 173",

Retrospective analysis revealed that cases compatible with the new disease had occurred in China starting in November 2002. SARS is caused by a newly recognized coronavirus that emerged in China, subsequently spreading to several other countries in Asia, the Americas, and Europe.124 Isolation and characterization of the agent was accomplished in record time after the 2002-2003 outbreak started, by four research groups in the WHO laboratory network. 124 In February 2003 a single infected person from the province of Guangdong, China, spent 1 day at a hotel in Hong Kong and transmitted the virus to 16 other people, who in turn seeded outbreaks of SARS in other countries in Asia and in Canada. In a matter of weeks, SARS had affected thousands of people in 25 countries in all continents, causing enormous global impact and intense media coverage, fueled by fast spread via international travel by newly infected individuals. 125 At the time of this writing, no current cases of SARS are registered, and there have been 8117 reported cases of SARS, of which 775 were fatal. 126",
