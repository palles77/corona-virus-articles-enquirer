Noteworthy percentages of the respondents self-reported increased frequencies of practicing favorable health-seeking behaviors in June 2003, as compared with the pre-SARS period. Few respondents reported the opposite. This was observed in different dimensions: health services seeking, adoption of healthier lifestyle, spending more resources on health, adoption of good personal hygiene, mask use when ill with influenza, and avoidance of risk behaviors. The frequencies of practicing most of these health-seeking behaviors, as measured in June and September 2003, were comparable. Further increases in healthy diet and weight control, etc., were observed during that period. Those who worried about contracting SARS were more likely to have improved health-seeking behaviors.",

In February 2003, a Chinese doctor stayed in a hotel in Hong Kong and infected seven guests who subsequently transmitted the disease to Canada, Singapore, and the United States [2] . Different hypotheses have been suggested for its mode of transmissions including aerosol dispersion [3] , environmental contamination [4] , and inter-species transmission [5, 6] . Nosocomial transmission was an early-noted feature of the disease with about 20% of the cases in the world belonging to this category [1] . In September 2003, one new SARS case was reported in Singapore [7] and from December 16, 2003 through April 30, 2004 , another 14 new SARS cases were reported in four areas in China (Taiwan, Guangdong, Beijing, and Anhui) [8] [9] [10] . It is still uncertain whether there will be any resurgence of SARS in other parts of the world.",

These models suggested that variables such as perceived efficacy, perceived susceptibility, perceived severity of the disease, perceived benefits, relevant norms and attitudes, behavioral intention, and perceived behavioral control, etc. to be predictive of practicing healthseeking behaviors. SARS was perceived to be severe as 84% of the general population believed that the epidemic was out of control and 51.6% believed that it was fatal [12] . Relevant norms had been formed in that people now believe that mask use signifies civic responsibility [12] . Over 90% of the general public believed that the use of face-masks, frequent hand-washing, and disinfection of living quarters to be efficacious means of SARS prevention. This study also showed that about 34% of the respondents worried that they themselves or their family members might contract SARS. Therefore, it is not surprising to observe an increase in the use of SARS-related preventive behaviors (such as mask use, hand hygiene, and disinfection of living quarters, etc.) when the post-SARS period and the pre-SARS periods were compared. It is, however, interesting to see that such behavioral changes have been sustained for an intermediate period of time (3 months). It is also very interesting to note that changes of health-seeking behaviors have spilled over to other areas that are less directly related to SARS, such as adherence to healthier life styles, compliance to medical advices, and avoidance of risk behaviors, etc. The behavioral changes may be indicative of fundamental changes in health-seeking behaviors.",

For instance, only 10% said that they were exercising more often during the SARS period and only 13.5% said that they were more likely than before to avoid practicing risk behaviors.
