In the virology field, this has become much less complex. For each virus, multiple targets are available and are well understood. Often, the limiting step in starting an antiviral discovery project is making the commercial case that the return on investment will be sufficient to justify the work. This issue is particularly the case for acute viral infections. The history of such projects is often that they fail to get off the ground because the commercial case is based on attempting to treat the \"otherwise healthy\" population. This approach is often superficially attractive simply because the numbers of such patients are so large. The real medical need and the commercial opportunity lie in finding the patient groups where an acute infection can be catastrophic. These patients may be the very young, the elderly or the immunocompromised. Table 1 lists the four virus families we have chosen to illustrate the issues in discovery of agents to combat acute virus infections. We will discuss each in turn, followed by the issues around emerging virus infections. ",

These compounds were shown to bind to the virus particle and to interfere with the early stages of viral replication. Classic experiments by Rossmann's group determined the three-dimensional structure of example inhibitors bound to virus particles and showed that they were bound to a canyon in the external structure of the viral capsid protein VP1. 1 A number of structural studies subsequently have confirmed this binding mode with more recently developed compounds on poliovirus 2 and enterovirus 71, 3,4 as well as rhinovirus. In rhinovirus itself, a consistent binding mode can be observed for inhibitors, with a range of interactions with key residues postulated, most notably H-bonding and p interactions with residue Y152. The mutations Y152P and V191L were observed in naturally derived serotypes, and alongside the A150V mutation that is observed across multiple serotypes, all these changes overcome the antiviral effect of inhibitors by reducing the binding affinity of the drug modification at or proximal to the binding site.",

The hypothesis proposed is that this mutation stabilizes a collapsed conformation of a portion of the protein that impedes inhibitor access. 5 As rational as these structural arguments appear, the major feature of drug development in this structural type has been the modification of features that have an effect on both binding affinity and the pharmacokinetic profile. The structures of these inhibitors are long, with multiple freely rotating bonds (Fig. 2) . In addition, metabolically labile groups, for example, ester and oximes, are common (CA603 (7), pirodavir (2) , and BTA188 (4); Fig. 2 ). Pleconaril was the first molecule in which these issues were addressed (through the incorporation of the trifluoromethyl-substituted oxadiazole system) and demonstrated satisfactory oral pharmacokinetics. 6 The latest inhibitor BTA798 (5) (vapendavir) 7 utilizes a benzisoxazole replacement for the labile functionality. This isostere appears to provide an orally bioavailable compound, although the bioavailability of 94% in rats is reported at a rather large dose of 50 mg kg \u00c0 1 and retains the potential for the saturation of any metabolic processes that may occur at lower doses closer to the therapeutic range.",

As the series developed, an appreciation emerged of variation in the sensitivity of various rhinovirus serotypes and the need for compounds with a wider spectrum of activity. 9 This work culminated in pirodavir (2) (R77,975), which entered clinical trials in challenge studies. 10 As with most capsid binders, the physicochemical properties of the compound made formulation difficult, and an intranasal spray was developed. The compound was tested both in the prophylaxis and treatment modes. There was a clear antiviral effect when the compound was used six times a day in the prophylactic mode, but the treatment data and the effect on the symptoms of the \"cold\" were disappointing.",

The 3C protease is essential for replication and is responsible for cleavage of the viral polyprotein into the active enzymes and structural components. Viral encoded proteases have been extensively explored as targets for chronic viral infections. These efforts inspired pioneering work on the equivalent rhinovirus enzyme by the Agouron group (later acquired by Pfizer). This team used a structure-based approach to optimize 3C protease inhibitors, culminating in ruprintivir (8) (formerly AG-7088), a potent agent active against all the rhinovirus isolates tested and some other picornaviruses. 15 The compound is a peptidomimetic whose design is based upon the picornaviral cleavage-site recognition characteristics. In these proteases, most cleavages occur between glutamine and glycine residues. In addition, the rhinovirus 3C protease catalytic triad of cysteine, histidine, and glutamic acid with a geometry similar to those observed in trypsin-like serine proteases suggested the incorporation of a covalent modifier warhead, specifically the a,b-unsaturated ester present in AG-7088. Incorporation of a cyclic butyramide at P1 provided the optimal structure shown in Fig. 3 . A detailed description of the optimization of the structural elements P2, P3, and P4 has been published. 16 The poor aqueous solubility of ruprintivir rendered formulation challenging, but adopting a nasal spray formulation enabled a clinical challenge study to explore the effectiveness of the drug against experimentally acquired infection. 17 While significant effects on some viral parameters were seen (especially with five times a day prophylactic dosing), there was little effect on the development of rhinovirus colds. As high concentrations of drug were reached in the nasal epithelium, this raises questions concerning the bioavailability of such drugs in the upper respiratory tract (URT) on one hand and the relevance of the experimental challenge model on the other.",

The virus spread around the world even in the absence of selective pressure with the drug, but subsequent seasons have not seen a rise in oseltamivir resistance rates above the background level of about 3% of all isolates. The level of resistance to other NA inhibitors is even lower (< 1%), but it is not clear if this is due to a real difference in the ease of mutant generation or to the much lower use of the other drugs. 33 Efforts have continued to develop improved NA inhibitors with enhanced activity, physicochemical properties, and ability to inhibit virus isolates resistant to other NA inhibitors. Peramivir ( Fig. 4 (12) ), developed by BioCryst, is a more costly NA inhibitor that can be given by infusion and is recommended in cases where oral or IV administration is difficult. 34 Laninamivir octanoate ( Fig. 4 (13) ) is a long-acting NA inhibitor developed by Biota in collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo.

Currently, the drug is in phase III trials in the United States to treat influenza in adults, using a much higher dose (Japanese dose is a 1.6 g loading dose followed by 400 mg twice a day, while the US dose is a loading dose of 3.6 g plus 400 mg four times a day). Favipiravir has weak activity against a wide variety of RNA viruses, including Ebola virus. Clinical trial data are awaited on the efficacy of the drug against the latter.",

RSV is clinically the most important member of the Paramyxoviridae family and was first isolated in 1956. There are two major serotypes of RSV, A & B, which alternate with each other and which cause similar disease. RSV is highly infectious and is transmitted through respiratory secretions via close contact with infected individuals, through droplets or through contaminated surfaces. In healthy adults, RSV is one of the causes of \"winter colds,\" but in infants, the virus causes 1-2 weeks of respiratory tract disease. Infants can continue to excrete virus for several weeks. By age 2, virtually all children have been infected by the virus. Infection by RSV induces only partial protection, and subsequent infection can occur even in the same winter season. RSV is a significant pathogen of the very young, the immunocompromised, and the elderly: l RSV in new born infants: In the United States, between 100,000 and 126,000 infants under 1 year have been hospitalized in each of the last 5 years. There are about 2.1 million outpatient consultations for the under 5 s with RSV each and every year. Each of these infants is a prime candidate for a safe and effective oral therapy. The mortality rate in the very young at risk infants is between 2% and 3% in most developed countries including the United States. Care of babies with RSV infection imposes a major burden on the hospital sector and limits capacity to undertake routine surgery. l RSV in the immunocompromised or other medically compromised patients: RSV is a major issue in those who are immunocompromised through natural causes, by cancer or chemotherapy, or deliberately for transplantation. Although numerically less significant, the considerable investment in such patients mandates their treatment. l RSV in the elderly: There is increasing awareness of the burden caused by RSV in the elderly. In years without a major influenza epidemic (i.e., most years; see Fig. 1 ), RSV is a more significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the over 60s. There are more than 2 million consultations with physicians in the United States each year due to RSV infection. The virus is also a significant problem in adults with COPD, where it is a major cause of exacerbations. In care homes, RSV causes annual epidemics during the winter season.",

Finally, in the adult population, treatment during a local epidemic would be of use to prevent the spread of this lifethreatening infection. The concept that there is insufficient time for therapeutic intervention during respiratory virus infections, derived from the influenza field, is now regarded as outmoded. 42 Due to the longer duration of RSV disease in both infants and adults, it is now widely accepted by the experts in the field that a small-molecule drug could be effective either for treatment or for prophylaxis. 43 ",

The F protein is essential for the entry of the virus into the host cell. Expression of the protein at the cell membrane causes cell-to-cell fusion, leading to the giant syncytia characteristic of RSV infection. Since the early discovery that inhibitors of the fusion of RSV virus particles and host cells could be readily identified by high-throughput screening, a great deal of work has been done to refine the potency and selectivity of a variety of structural types of inhibitor. Early work in the field has been surveyed in previous reviews. 46, 47 More contemporary research has led to a high-resolution, three-dimensional understanding of the fusion process and its inhibition. For an excellent detailed overview of F protein structure and function, see Battles et al., 48 who described a structural analysis of inhibitor interaction with the prehairpin structure of the RSV fusion protein. In that work, a number of inhibitor structures were docked into a trimeric model of the fusion complex based upon the crystal structure of JNJ-250685 bound to a prefusion construct. Although not all-encompassing, a rational description of the binding of these drug-like and structurally diverse inhibitors is evident from these studies. Fig. 6 provides an annotated version of the binding modes of JNJ-2408068 (17), Biota-9881 (substituting in this analysis for the structurally related BTA-C585 (18) and ). Most evident is the hydrophobic p/p nature of the binding of the Biota compound (18) , with JNJ-258606 and presumably GS-5806 taking advantage in addition of further energetically beneficial polar interactions by virtue of the amines they incorporate.",

In 2014, Draffan et al. 51 disclosed a generic structure for a compound that is potent in the human epithelial airway model (EC 50 8.4 nM), but with some variability in clinical isolate data (most EC 50 s appear around 100 nM), and exhibits oral bioavailability (59% is quoted in rat and 107% in dog at a dose of 20 mg kg \u00c0 1 ). Efficacy in the cotton rat model is described, with a 99% reduction in viral titer observed at 100 mg kg \u00c0 1 . A 2011 patent supporting this generic structure describes example 22 (Fig. 8) as one of the more potent examples (2.2 nM in an RSVA2 cytopathic effect assay). 52 The failure of a single fusion inhibitor to reach the market may reflect an attrition rate typical of pharmaceutical development in general but leaves open the question of clinical validation. In that context, the first successful clinical study with a fusion inhibitor was recently reported by Gilead with GS-5806. 53 This compound given rapidly reduced viral load and symptoms of RSV disease in volunteers with confirmed RSV infection. The compound is leading a group of fusion programs from J&J, Biota Holdings, Teva, ARK Therapeutics, and ReViral. Table 2 gives an overview of the stage of development of these efforts, all of which are or will be in clinical studies in 2016. There is an active debate about the ultimate clinical utility of fusion inhibitors given the relatively rapid emergence of resistance mutants during in vitro studies. This was first observed in the pioneering work of the BMS group. 54 Subsequently, Yan et al. 55 showed that mutants obtained to a novel fusion inhibitor structure mapped to the same region of the protein as other fusion inhibitor mutants. This group claimed that one of their mutants was equally pathogenic to the wild-type virus in a murine model of RSV.",

MERS-CoV does not spread readily from human to human. Nevertheless, the virus has caused small epidemics, mainly in Saudi Arabia. In total, there have been about 1644 cases and 590 related deaths. Cases have been exported to several countries including South Korea, where more than 100 cases resulted though infection in a healthcare setting. Good infection control measures are very effective. The arrival of a second coronavirus with significant healthcare impact has reawakened interest in both vaccine and drug research.",

The most recent outbreak began in 2014 and is the largest to date (> 28,657 cases and 11,325 deaths). The infection has about a 50% mortality rate and has been transported via air travel. The natural hosts of Ebola virus are thought to be fruit bats. Infection of humans occurs through contact with dead animal tissue or body fluids; human-to-human transmission occurs by similar routes. Ebola virus belongs to the Filoviridae family of the Mononegavirales, in the same order as the Paramyxoviridae family. Given clinical precedent with these related viruses, the viral RNA polymerase is a logical target for drug discovery. Several groups have screened nucleoside libraries to identify leads. Of existing nucleoside antivirals, favipiravir (see section \"Influenza Viruses\"), brincidofovir (see section \"Adenovirus\"), and BCX4430 (BioCryst) 66 have all shown some activity in animal models. Unfortunately, none were used early enough in the epidemic to obtain indications of clinical efficacy. Further work is underway to look for selective Ebola virus nucleoside inhibitors.",

A program to identify a suitable prodrug of GS-441524 provided GS-5734, a monophosphoramidate, which has potent in vitro activity against multiple filoviruses, with EC 50 values in the 0.1-0.2 mM range (Ref. 67; http://www.usamriid.army.mil, Oct. 9, 2015). In a rhesus monkey model of Ebola infection, the compound was effective in a therapeutic mode. 68 GS-5734 has activity against not only filoviruses but also arenaviruses and coronaviruses. The compound's clinical potential mandated its use in a Scottish nurse who had contracted the Ebola infection while working with patients in Sierra Leone. She was treated at the Royal Free Hospital in London and discharged Jan. 2015 but was readmitted to the same hospital in Oct. 2015, when her Ebola virus infection relapsed in the form of acute meningitis.",

In hepatitis C, we have seen effective cures for patients, reducing treatment times from a year to a few weeks. This success can now be applied to acute viral infections. Using four examples of respiratory tract infection, we have sought to illustrate the different challenges that need to be overcome to bring a new medicine to patients.
