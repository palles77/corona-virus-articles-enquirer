We report a case of EBOV encephalitis.A 30-year-old woman with no known EBOV contact sought treatment at an Ebola isolation unit in Freetown, Sierra Leone, on January 1, 2015 (day 7 of illness). She was afebrile and weak, but ambulatory, with a history of fever, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and muscle and joint pain. According to local protocol, she was given oral antimalarial, antimicrobial, and antiemetic drugs and oral rehydration therapy. On day 8 of illness, after testing EBOV PCR-positive (cycle threshold [C t ] value of 23.5) (1), she was given intravenous ceftriaxone (2 g) for 7 days, artesunate (180 mg) for 3 days, and Ringer's lactate (4-6 L) with supplemental KCl for 5 days.During days 13-15, the patient improved, moving independently and talking. On day 16, she became confused; by day 20, she was unresponsive to voices. Intravenous ceftriaxone (2 g) and artesunate (180 mg) were administered for an additional 7 and 3 days, respectively. On days 28 and 29, she was still unconscious; serum PCR test results on both days were negative for EBOV. On day 29, she was transferred to Connaught Hospital in Freetown, where she had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 9/15 (E3, V1, M5) but no localizing or focal signs. She was",
