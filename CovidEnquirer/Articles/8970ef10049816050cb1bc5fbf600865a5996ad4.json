            "text": "The recent advances in large-scale DNA sequencing technologies has significantly reduced the cost of this work, and it has become feasible to determine the sequence of multiple isolates of a number of viruses and examine smaller and smaller differences between them. The availability of this type of data permits novel hypotheses to be tested, but it requires new bioinformatics tools. For a number of years, our laboratory has been designing software specifically to manage and analyze large numbers of the bigger virus genomes such as those of poxviruses. Poxvirus genomes range in size from 150-380 kb and encode several hundred proteins [1] ; there are now more than 30 completely sequenced poxvirus genomes available from GenBank. Coronaviruses provide another important example, with the largest genome (~30 kb) of all RNA viruses and 99 isolates of the SARS virus completely sequenced. This wealth of sequence data provides excellent opportunities to study new aspects of virus virulence and evolution. The Poxvirus Orthologous Clusters (POCs; [2] ) mySQL database and query tools, now expanded to Virus Orthologous Clusters (VOCs), was constructed to organize all the genomes of one virus family into a single database and to group orthologous genes into families. A variety of tools are integrated into the database for rapid comparison of not only individual genes and proteins but also entire gene families if required. These tools include BLAST [3, 4] , CLUSTALW [5, 6] , T-coffee [7] , hydrophobicity plots (using Kyte-Doolittle, Hopp-Woods and Parker-Guo-Hodges scales of hydrophobicity), DNA/protein dotplots and NAP [8] to align protein to DNA sequences. Gene maps of complete virus genomes are also generated automatically in VOCs. Continuing on the theme of working with gene families and complete genomes, the Viral Genome Organizer (VGO; [9] ) was designed to display multiple whole genomes in a single working window with zooming capabilities and showing a variety of information such as ORFs, start/stop codons and AT%. VGO acts as a graphical portal to a variety of data that is stored in VOCs (amino acid composition, nucleotide composition, presence of orthologs in other genomes and preprocessed BLAST searches) or generated on-the-fly; for example clicking on gene X in one genome will cause the orthologous gene to be highlighted in a related genome. This software has the ability to easily and quickly answer a database query such as display genes present in variola virus that are absent from vaccinia virus. However, no software existed that could display all nucleotide differences between variola virus strain 1 and variola virus strain 2 and provide a summary of implications of these base changes; therefore the development of Base-By-Base (BBB) was initiated. This level of detail is required by current sequencing projects that aim to identify the genetic determinants responsible for phenotypes such as mortality rate/virulence, host tropism or tissue tropism displayed by different isolates of a single virus species. BBB allows the user to quickly display all nucleotide differences between genomes, and provides a detailed summary of the effect that each change produces in the relevant genes.",

These small alignment errors pose a serious problem with fine analysis of genomes because the insertion of erroneous gaps results in an increase in the number of apparent, but not real, nucleotide substitutions. BBB provides a visual display to help the molecular biologist recognize these errors and quickly correct them using the built in sequence editor. Accurate large-scale alignments are essential for determining the evolutionary relationship of closely related viruses (such as isolates of a single strain), and in such alignments insertions and deletions themselves are very useful indicators of evolutionary lineage. Thus BBB will be very useful for phenotype/genotype analysis and for epidemiology.",

Both FASTA and ClustalW (.aln) formatted text files can be loaded into the program; multiple sequences may be placed in a single file and additional sequences can also be added at any time. Similarly, alignments may be exported in either of these formats. The native file format of BBB is, however, based on the Bioinformatics Sequence Markup Language (BSML) [11] standard that is itself an Extensible Markup Language (XML) dedicated to the needs of bioinformatics; it aims to provide an open language definition for distributing sequence data. The BBB file format stores the sequence alignment, gene features and other user-defined annotations for the sequences; because of the highly modular nature of XML, it is easy to incorporate new information in the alignment while maintaining compatibility with previous versions. XML is also highly interoperable since it has as its root a plain text file, allowing BBB and BSML files to be easily integrated with other software packages.",

Gaps and mismatched nucleotides are shown as red and navy blue boxes or bars in between the 2 sequences, respectively. and remove gaps; multiple sequences may be selected and edited as one. One of many unique features of BBB is that the main window displays the DNA or protein sequences together with flags that show all the nucleotide or amino acid differences that are present between the sequences shown in the window. This information provides very important visual cues as to the position of major and minor differences between the sequences in an alignment and is updated in real-time as the user makes edits to the alignments ( Figure 1 ). BBB provides a button to allow the user to skip through a sequence from one flagged nucleotide difference to the next, alleviating the need to scroll through an entire genome and detect the differences by eye. The sequence substitutions, insertions and deletions are flagged and color-coded in a single row between the pairs of sequences ( Figure 1 ). The program preferences can be set so that the difference data represents differences between each adjacent pair of sequences or to a consensus sequence calculated by BBB. In pairwise comparison mode, the first sequence is compared to the second, second to the third and so on, making BBB especially useful for visualizing evolution of sequences. When comparing to the consensus, the sequence differences indicated on the screen are those differences between each sequence and the consensus sequence, this allows for a global view of the alignment and easily identifies conserved/variable regions in genomes which is useful information in drug design and vaccine development. The consensus sequence generated from an alignment can also be saved to a file (FASTA format) for analysis with other software.",

These flags are created for the displayed area only, and are then updated and augmented when needed, such as when the user changes the alignment, by inserting or deleting gaps, or changes the view, by scrolling or setting the display area. This enables BBB to work with multiple large genome sequences and keep an acceptable refresh rate for displayed data. A Block Glue option facilitates the movement of long sequence blocks that are bigger than the editing window by permitting the dragging of complete blocks without introduction of new gaps within the alignment. Often alignment errors are obvious to an experienced molecular biologist and the alignment can be manually corrected, simply by dragging the appropriate nucleotides into new positions. However, if there are doubts about the DIALIGN2 alignment or if there are a large number of sequences in the alignment, the user may choose to perform a local re-alignment of selected regions of the sequences using the ClustalW or T-coffee module of BBB. After the server completes an alignment, a new BBB window displays the new local alignment and the user is offered the option to import this new local alignment back into the original complete genome alignment. If required, forward and backward 3-frame translations of the DNA sequences can be displayed in the main sequence alignment window to help with alignment decisions. Methionines (green) and stop codons (red) are highlighted on the 3-frame translations, as are the genes that are associated with individual sequences through annotations in the BBB file. Figure 1 shows an example of a correction of a small mismatched region of two poxvirus genomes; breaking the single gap and moving the two resulting gaps reduces the number of mismatched nucleotides (not including those opposite a gap) from 10 to 3.",

BBB allows users to filter their view of the data in two ways, 1) complete genome sequences can be sorted and reordered in the main window or placed in the background, completely hidden from view to make analysis of dozens of sequences possible; 2) long genome alignments can be masked from the 5' and/or 3' ends to allow a user to focus on any particular region within the genome; this is especially useful for visually tracking the differences between individual orthologous genes in several different genomes. These user selected viewing options also apply to the functions for generating visual or tabular reports; only the genomes shown in the main window and the unmasked regions are evaluated by these report routines. From the preferences window, users can also toggle on/off the display of the sequence difference flags, sequencenumbering scales, user annotations, and there is a button in the main window to toggle on/off the display of 3frame translation of DNA sequences (Figure 1 ).

This type of analysis of promoter regions is very important when looking at different isolates of a single virus strain since modulation of gene expression may occur rapidly. Changes of one or two nucleotides in the small promoters of poxviruses can have a drastic effect on transcription rate and ultimately on protein expression [17, 18] .

This is a tedious process using regular expressions; therefore, a fuzzy motif search capability was also implemented in BBB that allows a user-selected number of mismatches and ignores gaps in sequence alignments. The search results are returned in two formats ( Figure 4) ; they are presented in table format in a new window together with information indicating the percent match to the query motif and are also indicated directly on the main sequence alignment window. To facilitate searches of long sequences or those that return a large number of matches, the search results table can be sorted by location of the match within the genome or by percent match (Figure 4) .

Both coding and intergenic (e.g. promoter) sequences are analyzed. We believe that BBB will significantly enhance the analysis of a growing set of sequence data, namely the accumulation of multiple closely related virus genomes. Correlations between sequence and phenotype can be analyzed and hypotheses developed for testing. Conserved and variable regions can be viewed for phylogenetic relationships or Web interface of a Base-By-Base summary Figure 5 Web interface of a Base-By-Base summary. Display of 11 SARS coronavirus genomes. Pink boxes at the top of the figure represent genes; annotations are derived from the VOCs database. After comparison to the consensus, nucleotide differences are displayed as vertical blue ticks or bars, and insertions and deletions are displayed in green and red, respectively.",
