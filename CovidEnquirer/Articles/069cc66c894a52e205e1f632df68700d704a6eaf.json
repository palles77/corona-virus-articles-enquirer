The CGN has been proposed to include the vacuolar elements of the intermediate or salvage compartment as well as the osmophilic fenestrated cisternae of the cis-Golgi.

Accordingly, enzymes such as cx-mannosidase II, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases and fucosyltransferase reside within the central Golgi stacks. The action of these enzymes is highly sequential and substrate-specific, and it is probably not necessary that each enzyme be vectorially confined to a specific cisterna.

However, the capability of a virus to bud into Golgi membranes is not necessarily dependent on the intrinsic targeting information contained within its structural proteins. Rather, the residency time and consequently concentration of viral membrane proteins within a particular intracellular membrane is likely to be a key determinant. For example, Semliki Forest virus (SFV), which normally buds at the cell surface, can be induced to assemble on Golgi membranes when infected cells are treated with monensin 1\u00b0. Monensin is a carboxylic ionophore that causes the pH of the Golgi to increase, which often results in a block irt protein transport through this organelle. Consequently, SFV spike glycoproteins build up to a sufficient concentration in the Golgi of monensin-treated cells to drive the budding reaction. In contrast, monensin inhibits budding of bunyaviruses (which normally assemble on these membranes) into Golgi cisternae but does not interfere with binding of nucleocapsids to membraneslL However, blocking transport of bunyavirus glycoproteins to the Golgi with brefeldin A allows virion assembly in the ER 12. Finally, inhibiting transport of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G protein from the TGN by incubating infected cells at 20\u00b0C does not result in intracellular virus assembly, nor are nucleocapsid structures present in the Golgi region ~3. These studies suggest that viral assembly depends not only on a critical concentration of spike proteins in a particular membrane but on other as yet undefined factors as well 1.",

In M protein from the prototypical murine hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV A59), each membrane-spanning domain functions independently as an orientation-specific signal or anchor domain TM. Unlike S, the distribution of M protein is restricted to intracellular membranes and was therefore previously thought to dictate the site of virus assembly. Expression of M protein from cDNA clones indicates that in the absence of other viral glycoproteins it is targeted distal to the virus budding site, i.e. the Golgi complex 19,2\u00b0. M protein from avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is retained in the cis-Golgi 21 and remains predominantly sensitive to endo H (which cleaves unprocessed asparagine-linked glycans). In contrast, the analogous glycoprotein from MHV A59 (which contains only O-linked sugars) is transported as far as the TGN 22, 23. Retention of the avian and murine M glycoproteins in the Golgi appears to involve different domains and possibly different mechanisms. Machamer and colleagues have demonstrated that the Golgi retention signal of IBV M is contained within the first membrane-spanning domain of the protein ~9,21. This was the first demonstration that Golgi targeting information resides within a transmembrane domain. In each case, the viral glycoprotein spike consists of two membrane glycoproteins represented by black and white bars. Synthesis of the viral glycoproteins takes place on membranes of the ER. (a) In the absence of heterodimer formation, most unassembled glycoprotein subunits accumulate in the ER whereas properly assembled subunits are transported to and retained in the Golgi complex where viral assembly occurs. The Golgi retention domain could be located on one or both subunits in this case. This scenario is analogous to those of HTV and RV.",

Studies using brefeldin A suggest that the TGN may be a distinct and separate entity from the rest of the Golgi 27-29. These experiments indicate that, unlike resident proteins of the Golgi stacks, proteins in the TGN do not seem to redistribute back to the ER during brefeldin A treatment.

This would necessitate preventing the bulk of M protein from being transported to the Golgi, since this is distal to the budding site. Two ways in which this could be achieved are: (1) binding of M protein to other viral proteins, to prevent or delay its entry into the Golgi (Fig. le) , or (2) retrieval of M protein from the Golgi stacks to the budding site. The two possible mechanisms need not be mutually exclusive; however, the former seems more likely in light of recent work by Rottier and colleagues. This group now has evidence that heteroligomerization between M and S proteins occurs in infected cells 2. Although S is transported to the plasma \"membrane, the rate of transport is extremely slow. The rate-limiting step in transport appears to be transfer of the glycoprotein from the ER to the Golgi (tl/2 for acquisition of endo H resistance is 60 min in infected cells and 180 min when S protein is expressed via cDNAI7). From this study it has been proposed that the prolonged transport of S from the ER to the Golgi may be instrumental in virus budding in this region.

By monitoring the oxidation of cysteine residues on newly synthesized G1 and G2, it has been found that G1 acquires its tertiary structure much faster than G2 (10 min versus 60 min) 36.

Currently, the most favored model 26 suggests that Golgi proteins form large oligomeric structures whose size prevents them from entering transport vesicles. Work by Swift and Machamer 54 is certainly consistent with this model. Their study shows that a chimeric protein retained in the Golgi region (VSV G protein in which the transmembrane domain is replaced by the first membranespanning domain from IBV M) forms large aggregates shortly after synthesis. However, in transfected COS cells the chimeric glycoprotein remains sensitive to endo H, and since its Golgi localization has not been verified by electron microscopy, it cannot be concluded unequivocally that this protein is targeted to the Golgi. For example, RV E1 glycoprotein accumulates in pre-Golgi structures located in the Golgi region, which by light microscopy are indistinguishable from bona fide Golgi elements in COS cells 5\u00b0,sl.",

It has been shown that deletion of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of Golgi proteins results in secretion of the luminal domain into the extracellular space sS. Conceivably, the Golgi membrane proteins may form a network or lattice structure that consists of more than one protein species. This may be particularly true for the carbohydrate-processing enzymes of the Golgi. In contrast, viral membrane glycoproteins would be expected to form a homogeneous lattice or patch since cellular membrane proteins are excluded from viral envelopes during the budding process. Interestingly, VSV G protein, which is blocked in the TGN by incubation at 20\u00b0C, forms regular arrays in the Golgi membranes ~3. It is tempting to speculate that such arrays or lattices are formed by resident Golgi proteins. To test this, antibodies to the cytoplasmic domains of Golgi-specific viral glycoproteins (and endogenous Golgi proteins) could be used to study the lateral mobility of proteins in isolated Golgi preparations. If large oligomers are formed, resident Golgi proteins would be expected to be less mobile and therefore exhibit less lateral diffusion in Golgi membranes than proteins in transit through this organelle.",

MHV M is at least partially dependent upon its cytoplasmically exposed carboxyl terminus for retention in the TGN; however, unlike the analogous segment in TGN 38, this domain is not sufficient to retain a reporter protein at this location 2s. Recently, it was demonstrated that in contrast to the results obtained with membrane proteins of the Golgi stack, overexpression of TGN 38 abolishes its intracellular localization and instead results in its appearance at the plasma membrane sT.

A Golgi retention signal was first localized in the transmembrane domain of a virus glycoprotein, which in turn expedited the discovery of other retention signals in and around the transmembrane domains of other Golgi proteins. Intracellularly retained viral glycoproteins are proving to be useful as model Golgi membrane proteins, and will undoubtedly shed light onto the mechanism(s) of retention of resident proteins in the Golgi. Studies are well under way to characterize the Golgi targeting signals in the glycoproteins of PTV, UUK and RV by the construction of deletion mutants and by transposing domains from these viral glycoproteins into cell surface proteins to verify that the retention signals function in a trans dominant manner. In fact, peptide segments that include the carboxy-terminal transmembrane regions of PTV G1 and RV E2 glycoproteins appear to contain Golgi targeting information. Fusion of these segments from PTV G1 and RV E2 to the ectodomains of glycoproteins that are normally transported to the cell surface results in retention of the chimeras in the Golgi (S-Y. Chen et al., submitted; T.C. Hobman and M.G. Farquhar, submitted). In addition, recent results suggest that UUK G1 glycoprotein may contain a Golgi retention signal (R. Persson et al., submitted).

What drives the budding reaction? UUK and RV glycoproteins require considerable time in the ER for heterodimer formation (and possibly assembly into even higher order structures), so do nucleocapsids first bind to the endodomains of these glycoproteins before they are transported to the Golgi? If yes, then what normally prevents virus assembly in the ER? An important clue comes from the work of Liu and Brown ss, who suggest that viral spike complexes can undergo dramatic rearrangements between transport from the site of assembly on the ER to the budding site at the cell surface. They propose that the nucleocapsid-binding domain in the carboxyl terminus of Sindbis virus E2 glycoprotein is sequestered in the ER lumen, whereas when the mature E2 glycoprotein (and its partner El) reach the cell surface, this domain is now cytoplasmically disposed and presumably able to bind to nucleocapsid complexes. It seems unlikely that this would be a general mechanism used by all viruses that assemble at the Golgi since brefeldin A treatment causes PTV to bud into the ER12; this indicates that, at least for this particular virus, transport to the Golgi is not a prerequisite for nucleocapsid binding. Therefore a multitude of other factors, including host cell type and time post-infection, are likely to influence where a particular virus assembles within a cell.
