            "text": "The influenza pandemic reached across every continent and caused devastating illnesses even in the most remote regions. The Wickstrom family of rural Minnesota was no exception. The infection swept through the family, sickening the parents and all eight children. Those who were less ill cared for the others. The eldest daughter, 19-year-old Ella, took care of her father and the other children, while her mother Selma and one of her brothers maintained the farm. In late November, 13-year-old Lester died, followed 5 days later by his 40-year-old father, Simon. The children were given little time to say goodbye to their brother and father. Their bodies were placed in wooden coffins and hastily buried by the local undertaker. Selma became a single mother at the age of 36. She and the surviving children, ranging in age from 1 to 19 years, were left to carry on in that chilling Minnesota winter (CDC, 2006a) . These kinds of losses played out millions of times around the world in 1918 and 1919 and left countless legacies of suffering and courage, the depth and breadth of which will never be fully known.",

Avian influenza (also AI or bird flu) A highly contagious viral disease with up to 100% mortality in domestic fowl caused by influenza A virus subtypes H5 and H7 (see Hemagglutinin). Low-pathogenic AI causes few problems and is carried by many birds with no resulting problems. Highly pathogenic AI kills birds and if transmitted to humans, can also be fatal. There is little or no human immunity, however humans are rarely affected. Community-based measures Activities to increase social distance that may include measures applied to whole neighborhoods, towns, or cities (eg, snow days, establishment of clinics, and community-wide quarantine). Containment measures Measures taken to control disease exposure at specific sites or buildings that may include cancellation of public events (eg, concerts, sports events, and movies), closure of office buildings, apartment complexes, or schools, and closure of public transit systems. These measures can also involve restricting entrance to buildings or other sites (eg, requiring fever screening or use of face masks before entry). Epidemic Disease occurring suddenly in humans in a community, region, or country in numbers clearly in excess of a typical presentation of the disease. H5N1 Variant of avian influenza, which is a type of influenza virulent in birds. H5N1 was first identified in Italy in the early 1900s and is now known to exist worldwide. Both low and highly pathogenic variants exist in different regions of the world. Hemagglutinin Important surface structure protein of the influenza virus. Hemagglutinin is an essential gene for the spread of the virus throughout the respiratory tract that enables the virus to attach itself to a cell in the respiratory system and penetrate it. Hemagglutinin is referred to as the \"H\" in influenza viruses (eg, H1N1). See also \"Neuraminidase.\" HPAI Highly pathogenic form of avian influenza. Avian flu viruses are classified based upon the severity of the illness and HPAI is extremely infectious among humans. The rapid spread of HPAI, with outbreaks occurring at the same time, is of growing concern for human health as well as for animal health. See also \"LPAI.\" Influenza Serious viral disease caused by influenza viruses that infect the respiratory tract. Isolation State of physical separation and restriction of movement between persons or groups to prevent the spread of disease. Isolation measures can be undertaken in hospitals or homes, as well as in alternative facilities. LPAI Low pathogenic form of avian influenza. Most avian flu strains are classified as LPAI and typically cause little to no clinical signs in infected birds. However, some LPAI virus strains are capable of mutating under field conditions into HPAI viruses. See HPAI. Mutation Any alteration in a gene from its original natural state. This change may be disease causing or a benign, normal variant. Neuraminidase Important surface structure protein of the influenza virus. Neuraminidase is an essential enzyme for the spread of the virus throughout the respiratory tract that enables the virus to escape the host cell and infect new cells. Neuraminidase is referred to as the \"N\" in influenza viruses (eg, H1N1). See also \"Hemagglutinin.\" Pandemic Worldwide outbreak of a disease in humans with case numbers clearly in excess of normal. Pathogenic Causing or capable of causing disease. Prepandemic vaccine Vaccine created to protect against currently circulating H5N1 avian influenza virus strains with the expectation it would provide at least some protection against new virus strains that might evolve. Prophylactic Pharmaceutical or a procedure with properties capable of prevention or protection against a disease or condition (eg, vaccines, antibiotics). Quarantine Time period of physical separation or restriction of movement decreed to control the spread of disease. Before the era of antibiotics, quarantine was one of the few available means of halting the spread of infectious disease. Quarantine is still used today as needed. Individuals may be quarantined at home or in designated facilities.",

Human influenza viruses have their origin in animal reservoirs that adapt and pass from birds and swine directly or through other mammals. To cause a pandemic, three barriers must be overcome: the virus must be transmissible from animals to humans, the virus must be able to infect human cells, and there must be the ability to transmit the virus from human to humans. While these seem like formidable barriers, evidence of the many pandemics indicates these genetic changes are achievable if not common.",

Throughout the past century there were four pandemics: 1918 , 1957 , 1968 (Cox and Subbarao, 2000 . The severity of seasonal or pandemic influenza is caused by the genetic structure of the virus. There are three types of influenza viruses: A, B, and C. Influenza A is the most dangerous for humans and influenza C is the least dangerous. The specific structure of the influenza virus is expressed by the proteins it carries. Hemagglutinin proteins of the virus are the components that enable the virus to penetrate a foreign body. There are 16 different hemagglutinin proteins possible. Neuraminidase is another key protein of the virus. Neuraminidase has nine protein varieties. These two proteins are the defining factors for each strain of influenza and are the basis for the \"H_N_\" designation. For example, there have been concerns over H5N1 as a potential candidate for a future influenza pandemic. Another terminology used in discussing the various strains of viruses refers to the pathogenicity in animals. Influenza virus strains are referred to as being either low pathogenic or high pathogenic. For several years, a low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H5N1 strain has been present in North America, while there has been a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 strain present in Asia (Badae et al., 2013; Inamasu et al., 2012; Manning, 2006) .",

            "text": "Influenza symptoms typically include fever, muscle pain, runny nose, and cough. Those who die from seasonal influenza frequently have chronic medical conditions or weaker immune systems and die from secondary illnesses such as pneumonia. The primary differences during an influenza pandemic are the disease severity and the populations affected (see Table 16 -1). Not only will the case-fatality ratio be excessive during a pandemic, but often those most severely affected are different demographically. In the 2009-2010 influenza A H1N1 pandemic, a study of 100 deaths revealed a high incidence of viral pneumonia and diffuse alveolar damage. These findings were similar to other findings in influenza outbreaks but different than \"typical\" seasonal influenza deaths (Sheih et al., 2010) . There were also a higher incidence of deaths in patients with morbid obesity, pregnancy, and sleep apnea. Rather than populations with weaker immune systems having more severe illness, those with healthier immune systems can be more susceptible. When the human immune system is fighting an infection, cytokines are responsible for activating the immune functions and also stimulating production of more cytokines. It is a looped system that keeps the immune system balanced to fight illness effectively while minimizing damage to healthy cells. Some highly pathogenic strains of influenza produce a \"cytokine storm\" where cytokines and immune cells become hyperstimulated and damage the healthy cells of an infected respiratory tract. During the 1918 pandemic, many individuals between the ages of 18 and 40 with healthier immune systems had more severe illness due to cytokine stimulation. As the immune system began damaging the healthy cells of the respiratory tract, it led to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Kobasa et al., 2004; Osterholm, 2005) . ARDS killed many within several days. Others succumbed over a longer period of time due to secondary bacterial infections of the lungs. These infections were ushered in by viral damage to the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract. Although the epithelial cells usually sweep the respiratory tract clean, as they are damaged by influenza viruses, bacteria from the mouth can make their way down the respiratory tract and cause secondary illnesses.",

This production schedule cannot be changed using the current technologies and manufacturing approaches. Newer flu vaccine production methods include a cell-based approach approved in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2012. The first approved cell-culture flu vaccine was called Flucelvax. Instead of incubating eggs, vaccine viruses are cultured mammalian cells, purified and tested for use in vaccine. In most cases, to achieve necessary immunity with any inactivated virus, two doses are necessary to activate and sustain an immune response. The newest and fastest process uses recombinant technology. Approved in 2013 under the name, Flublok, the recombinant vaccine is one produced without using egg products or actual virus. Instead, Flublok uses an influenza virus protein made through genetic modification of a virus that infects insect cells. The virus produces an influenza protein that stimulates the immune response (FDA, 2015) .",

            "text": "Vaccination rates following pandemic campaigns will vary. In multiple studies, several factors increased the likelihood of being vaccinated during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic: being a member of a priority group (healthcare worker, having children younger than 5 in the household, having a chronic condition with increased risk for complications from H1N1); having a history of seasonal flu vaccination and having a medical provider. Gilmour and Hofmann (2010) also found nearly three-quarters of those who had not been vaccinated reported they did not think it was necessary. Delays in vaccine distribution and delivery, relying on specialty care physicians for vaccinations (other than obstetricians) and a longer pandemic locally decreased vaccine rates (Davila-Payan et al., 2014) . In the United States, vaccine rates were lower in some ethnic minorities because of fears of being used for experimentation. Public messaging must be culturally sensitive and multiple layers of communications strategies need to be applied in order to reach the most vulnerable populations. Antiviral drugs are the most effective pharmaceutical options immediately available for managing an avian influenza pandemic (Schunemann et al., 2007) . Although there are multiple drugs approved by the U.S. FDA for treatment and prevention of influenza, in recent years several strains of influenza show resistance to many previously prescribed antiviral drugs (CDC, 2006b) . Using predictive modeling based on WHO criteria for a pandemic, Gani et al. (2005) suggests having antiviral access, through stockpiling or immediate commercial availability, with enough available to treat 25% of the population could reduce hospitalizations by 50-75%. In the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, an assessment of the efficacy of antiviral use confirmed this, especially among the age group of 18-64 years (Atkins et al., 2011) . Communities need to develop strategies for allocating antiviral medications when in short supply while awaiting development and distribution of strain-specific vaccine.",

In allocating scarce resources, antiviral medications may be used early in a pandemic for close contacts of initial cases and to contain disease clusters. Close contacts may include family members, friends, coworkers, healthcare providers, and fellow travelers on aircraft, buses, etc. The targeted use of antiviral medications can contain an outbreak or reduce individual and public health impact. The use of antiviral medications can also prevent cases in high-risk facilities such as long-term care or in welldefined regions such as military installations or school campuses. Strategies for use of antiviral medications for prevention and treatment may change during a pandemic. Early in the pandemic to a new region, it may be best to use antiviral medications to prevent infections.

There are several nonpharmaceutical interventions that offer the best prevention: hand washing, isolation, quarantine, and social distancing. The primary nonpharmaceutical intervention is hand washing. It is the most effective, most underrated measure to prevent illness. Isolation of those who are sick from those who are healthy is another fundamental nonpharmaceutical measure. Isolating sick patients in hospitals or at home should be undertaken with appropriate personal protective equipment if available. During a pandemic, hospitals may be full, and many who are able to care for themselves, or who have an adequate support system to provide care, should isolate themselves from others to reduce the risk of additional virus transmission. There are also those who are not yet ill but may have been exposed to the virus. These individuals may choose self-quarantine. Others with no illness or known exposure may choose social distancing by not attending social functions, limiting time in crowds, and/or wearing protective face masks. The concept is the same for all these prevention measures. In the context of prevention, the primary distinction between isolation, quarantine, and social distancing is the health status of the person taking action to stay away from others.",

Although this vision seems relatively simple, the challenge rests in translating it into tangible preparedness activities that federal, state, and local governments can take to enhance future response.

The need for rapid hospital surge capacity is a common factor in all pandemics. 3. Pandemic viral strains are more lethal and often cause severe disease in unlikely age groups, such as young, healthy adults. 4. Pandemics occur in waves. Age groups and geographical areas not affected initially are more likely to be vulnerable in subsequent waves. Subsequent waves are often more severe. 5. Virological surveillance is often the key to alerting public health agencies to a coming pandemic by isolating and characterizing the virus, and making it available to vaccine manufacturers. 6. Over the centuries, most pandemics have originated in parts of Asia where dense populations of humans live in close proximity to ducks and pigs. 7. Historically, public health interventions delay international spread of pandemics, but do not stop them. Quarantine and travel restrictions have little effect on viral disease spread. 8. Delaying disease spread can flatten the epidemiological peak, thus distributing cases over a longer period of time. Having fewer people ill at a given time increases the likelihood medical and other essential services can be maintained and reduces patient surge capacity needs ( Fig. 16-8 ). 9. The impact of vaccines on a pandemic remains to be demonstrated. In 1957 In , 1968 vaccine manufacturers responded with too little vaccine, too late into the disease spread to have an impact.",

With each increase in pandemic intervals, a variety of response measures are instituted. The intervals address the need for triggers. As events unfold leading up to a pandemic, it is essential to maintain a common frame of reference to understand when actions must be taken. There is no way to predict the timeframe for changes between the intervals. It may take days or years to move up or down from one interval to another. This variable timeline underscores the importance of coordinated pandemic preparedness planning. The six intervals do not run concurrently with the WHO phases (see Table 16 -2). The intervals for U.S. government actions are based on the specific threat to the U.S. population. Many preparedness and response activities undertaken by the U.S. during a future pandemic may be triggered by a CDC evaluation tool called the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool or IRAT. The IRAT uses 10 scientific measures of the risk for emergence of a novel influenza virus and its public health impact. Each of the 10 criteria is used in a scoring system to depict pandemic risk. This includes \"low risk\" with scores between 1 and 3, \"moderate risk\" with scores between 4 and 7, and \"high risk\" for scores between 8 and 10. These outcomes are reviewed and weighted according to the risks of emergence and public health impact (CDC, 2014b) . These 10 criteria are grouped into three categories:",

The strategy to accomplish this is to institute community measures to delay and compress the outbreak peak (see Fig. 16-8) . As interventions are instituted, some cases of illness will be delayed and others prevented. As a result, the cases in a given region can be spread over a longer period of time. Even though some who delay their illness eventually become ill, as the cases are spread over a more manageable timeframe, the peak number of cases will be more manageable for providers making it easier to sustain essential services.",

No intervention is without some economic or social cost. If individuals are isolated or quarantined, and there is no support system in place to provide essentials such as groceries and prescriptions, or services such as child care for ill parents of small children, there can be social disruption in addition to extended health effects. Economic protection measures may need to be considered to allow those who are ill to work from home or at least to have some assurance taking sick days will not result in job loss. A variety of consequences must also be considered when closing schools and day care centers or when discouraging public gatherings. Children are at increased risk of influenza transmission in both preschool contacts and school-age contacts. Viboud et al. (2004) found there was also an increased risk in contacts exposed to preschool index patients and school-age index patients compared with those exposed to adult index cases. However, there are substantial economic and social outcomes to school-related measures. If children are not in school or day care, some parents will be unable to work. Parents are also likely to congregate children who have been kept out of school in order to have child care and to provide a diversion for the children, thereby negating the desired social distancing. If mass transit and congregate gatherings are discouraged, a variety of industries will suffer. Social distancing interventions may be important to public health but must be used judiciously. If the impact is seen as too severe, the political and social consequences may be too burdensome and the public may not comply. On the other hand, if interventions are established too late, they may be ineffective. n n n Nonpharmaceutical Intervention Examples 1. Isolation of the sick at home or in healthcare settings.

The nongovernment resources from businesses, faithbased organizations, and others will certainly play a major role in a community pandemic response. Even communities with relatively broad preparedness participation from these organizations have rarely identified and characterized the resources and support these organizations can offer during an actual pandemic. It is also not known what policies may be instituted by these organizations to support or counter nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as implementation of sick leave benefits. It is difficult to effectively strategize with the substantial gaps existing in current planning assumptions.

It is important to consider the post influenza pandemic scenarios and extend the process well beyond where many plans currently stop. For example, if there are significant fatalities within a certain demographic, special challenges for handling of human remains will emerge. If there are substantial numbers of adult losses, the secondary impact may be the loss of primary caregivers for children in some urban communities. If the losses are more among the working population, there are essential businesses and services that may be short-handed and unable to perform indispensable functions. This inoperability will result in a long-term economic ripple as production decreases, investment capital is diminished and further production is reduced. The healthcare sector is particularly vulnerable because healthcare workers will be repeatedly exposed. The system may suffer excessive losses, compromising the availability of staff or the standard of care. Even when the pandemic has resolved, critical infrastructure may take some time to fully recover. There are many unknowns in predicting what special challenges may result from a pandemic, making it critically important to push forward in the planning, training, and exercising of processes to include the recovery component addressing these possibilities.
