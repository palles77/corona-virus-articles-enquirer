Maternal blood and milk samples and blood samples from their babies were collected at 2-weekly intervals until 26 weeks after parturition. Samples were assayed for rotavirus antibodies by ELISAs and neutralisation tests. Vaccination produced statistically significant increases in maternal serum IgG and neutralising antibodies, and in milk IgA, IgG, and neutralising antibodies. Control baboon mothers sampled from 12 weeks after delivery had lower serum and milk antibody titres, but responded to vaccination at 16 weeks by producing a similar antibody proJile in serum and milk to those previously vaccinated. Because of the endemic nature of human rotaviral infections, similar maternal vaccinations have potential as a means of increasing milk antibodies to a level at which they may be protective to infants.",

Development of a rotaviral vaccine has been accorded high priority by WHO, with the emphasis on live vaccines for oral delivery to the young child. This has stimulated considerable research, using particularly rotaviruses of animal origin or genetic reassortant viruses of mixed animal-human strains. The principal problems encountered have been: the serotypic specificity of the immune response, necessitating the inclusion of multiple serotypes; and the difficulty in achieving the appropriate balance between attenuation and ability to replicate effectively in the intestine3. To date, safe and effective vaccines for children are not available.",

The first modified live calf rotavirus vaccines had been developed by 1973\", but contemporary comparative trials consistently failed to demonstrate protection'. 6. As a result, the more popular approach in cattle has been through maternal parenteral vaccination, stimulating the secretion of specific antibodies in colostrum and milk' to take advantage of the fact that rotavirus antibody present in the lumen of the intestine is an effective mediator of protection'. 9. Not all vaccines based on this concept have proven efficacious, perhaps due to insufficient antigen or poor adjuvantation; but several effective and commercially successful vaccines for cattle do exist, and have been proven in the field over a number of years'\"-'3. The development of rotaviral vaccines for pigs is some years behind that for cattle, and at this stage mixed results have been obtained14. 15. A potentially significant advantage of maternal vaccination is the heterotypic nature of the immune response of adults with wide previous exposure to endemic rotaviral infections. Children and young animals encountering their first rotavirus infection mount an immune response that is largely serotypespecific in terms of in vitro assays and in vivo protection'6'8.",

However, of greater significance was the observation that this simple parenteral immunisation also stimulated increases in IgA production by the mammary glands. Due to a fault in experimental procedures milk was not collected from the control group until 12 weeks into lactation, so an accurate definition of the extent to which IgA antibodies in early lactation were raised cannot be made. However, by the period of 12-16 weeks when comparable samples were obtained, IgA, IgG, and RRV VN antibodies were enhanced in the immunised group. The potential for successful immunisation even during lactation was shown after vaccination of the control group at 16 weeks, which produced increases particularly in IgA titres.

Many of the key features of this relationship were elucidated in studies on transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) of swine, a severe coronaviral enteritis*'. Secretory IgA is the dominant immunoglobulin isotype in postcolostral sows' milk, and more than 90% of this SIgA is locally produced by mammary gland plasma cells whose precursors originated in the intestinal tract and migrated through the so-called gut-mamm,ary axis. Enhancement of effective antibody secretion in milk is dependent on prior stimulation of local intestinal immunity, and in herds with endemic TGE parenteral vaccination of sows leads to boosting of milk Sl[gA and improved protection of piglets fed with this milk2'.",

In a classic experiment, Svennerholm and colleaguesz7 gave a subcutaneous injection of whole-cell cholera vaccine to both Swedish and Asian women. The Swedes were anticipated to have had no previous cholera exposure, and indeed had low or negative preexisting antibody titres. The Asian women were from an endemic area where natural exposure could be anticipated. Although vaccination stimulated increases in serum IgG in both groups, only the mothers with prior intestinal exposure produced significant titres of milk IgA antibodies. Subsequently a prospective study confirmed that protection against symptomatic cholera infection in sucking infants was associated with higher levels of antibody in breast milk2*.",

Protection against rotaviral infection in the immediate postnatal period has been demonstrated3*. Further into lactation, any effect is clearly limited, with at best suggestions that the clinical course but not the infection rate may be modified by milk antibody titres33, or that higher milk antibody titres may interfere with vaccine take34. More commonly it has not been possible to demonstrate a protective effect of human milk against rotaviral diarrhoea3'. 36. However, a more optimistic assessment of the potential for passive immunisation through maternal immunisation can be drawn from consideration of animal experiments and artificial feeding of infants: (1) while 'natural' titres of antibody in the milk of endemically infected cows and sows are also not protective, they can be boosted through maternal vaccination to levels which are demonstrably protective against field infections2; (2) passive protection is an outcome of the maintenance of an adequate concentration of antibody in the intestine over a period of time, and is crucially dependent on titre37; (3) the protective potential of ingested antibody has been amply demonstrated in infants3840.

Significant IgA and VN antibody titres were also present in milk at titres higher than those in endemically infected but unvaccinated controls. The IgA response suggests local antibody production in the mammary gland, which was elicited by the prior intestinal exposure of these animals to rotavirus antigens. VN titres were not raised as consistently as IgA titres, and attempts to use more sensitive neutralisation assays such as plaque reduction or epitope blocking using neutralising monoclonal antibodies4' would be warranted. Further studies are necessary to optimise this enhancement of lacteal antibodies, and to investigate their protective potential. One potential disadvantage of this approach could be the loss of the protective effect that neonatal rotaviral infection has on subsequent childhood infection4'. However, it is more likely that passive ingestion of antibody would allow limited replication of virus in a subclinical infection thus allowing development of immunity, rather than conferring complete protection against infection\".",
