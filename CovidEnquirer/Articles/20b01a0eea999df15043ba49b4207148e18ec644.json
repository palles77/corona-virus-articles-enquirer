However, when reminded by a computer system that monitored electronic patient data about the need to vaccinate a specific patient or order a needed test, physicians complied with standards of care at twice the rate as when not reminded. When the system stopped reminding the physicians, however, their compliance rates quickly returned to baseline; thus, any \"education\" or \"training\" that the system provided had no lasting effect on compliance.",

Congenital heart diseases are severe birth defects of the valves and structure of the heart. In the 1960s, the exact nature of heart malformations was very difficult to diagnose without invasive and risky angiographic procedures. Dr. E Timothy de Dombal developed a similar system for the differential diagnosis of the acute abdomen, another high-stakes diagnostic problem. A surgeon must differentiate between conditions that require emergency surgery, such as appendicitis, and conditions, such as pancreatitis, for which surgery is relatively contraindicated (de Dombal et al., 1972 , de Dombal et al., 1974 , Wilson et al., 1975 , de Dombal, 1975 , Wilson et al., 1977 , de Dombal, 1984 , Adams et al., 1986 , McAdam et al., 1990 , de Dombal, 1990 , de Dombal et al., 1993 , American College of Emergency Physicians, 1994 .",

            "text": "We can perhaps best explain how a diagnostic expert system works by analogy to the process that a physician uses to diagnose a patient. Like a physician, a diagnostic expert system begins by collecting information about the patient's illness-symptoms, observations from physical examination, results from laboratory tests, risk factors for disease (e.g., travel to a foreign country) and pre-existing medical conditions (e.g., diabetes). We refer to this diagnostic information collectively as the findings. Of course, the computer usually does not interview the patient and (at present) never examines the patient. Rather, a physician interviews and examines the patient after which she or an assistant enters the findings into the program (e.g., Warner and Bouhaddou, 1994 , London, 1998 , Buchanan and Shortliffe, 1984 , Miller et al., 1986 , Shwe et al., 1991 , Heckerman et al., 1992 . Increasingly, diagnostic expert systems acquire findings automatically from clinical information systems (Aronsky et al., 2001 , Burnside et al., 2004 , McDonald et al., 1991 . There are also examples of diagnostic expert systems that interview patients directly to obtain their medical histories (Pynsent and Fairbank, 1989, Wald et al., 1995) . Notes: The notation p(FMD) actually is shorthand for a probability of an event variable called FMD that can take the values true or false. So, p(FMD) actually stands for p(foot and mouth disease is present) or p(foot and mouth disease is not present). If we to write Table 13 .1 out in its full form, it would have four rows corresponding to p(FMD is present) = 0.001, p(FMD is absent) = 0.999, p(MCD is present) = 0.001, p(MCD is absent) = 0.999. The laws of probability require that the sum of the probabilities for all the event variable outcomes will be equal to 1 (e.g., p[FMD is present] + p[FMD is absent] = 1, because it is a certainty that something is either present or it is absent), so knowledge engineers usually save space by only writing one row per disease. FMD, foot and mouth disease; MCD, mad cow disease.",

The inference engine uses both patient data and medical knowledge to compute a differential diagnosis and to generate suggestions for additional collection of data. The inference engine obtains data from an inbound data-acquisition interface and it outputs the differential diagnosis and suggestions for additional data through an outbound results interface. In a freestanding diagnostic expert system such as Iliad or BOSSS, both the data-acquisition and results interfaces are screens that a physician interacts with. In an embedded system like Antibiotic Assistant, the dataacquisition interface is with hospital information systems (and to some extent with the user, but only for selected items of information that the user wishes to provide). The results interface could also be with another computer system such as a point-of-care system, which would present the differential diagnosis and suggestions through its own screens. convert information in the literature into a knowledge base is referred to as knowledge acquisition or knowledge engineering (Feigenbaum, 1977) .",

Many readers will be quite familiar and comfortable with the concept of sensitivity and specificity of laboratory tests, but perhaps not with the idea of sensitivity and specificity of other findings. In fact, symptoms, travel history, results of physical examination, and results of laboratory tests are all nothing more than observations that we make about an individual that may help us discriminate between individuals with disease and those without disease. It is possible to measure a sensitivity, specificity (or, alternatively, likelihood ratios) for any of these diagnostic observations. Consider the diseases presented in mini-BOSSS. Cattle affected with FMD develop very severe mouth vesicles and ulcers. This mouth pain results in excessive salivation; therefore, it causes drooling of saliva. Cattle affected with MCD do not develop mouth wounds; therefore, they are not likely to be observed drooling saliva. The conditional probabilities in Table 13 .2 reflect the observations above; P(drooling of salivalFMD) is equal to 0.95 and p(drooling of salivalMCD) is equal to 0.001.",

If drooling saliva and more than one animal affected were not independent, given that we know that the cow has FMD, then we could add an arc between them. Figure 13 .11 shows a portion of the Bayesian network that underlies the Pathfinder system, which is a diagnostic expert system for pathologists who are interpreting biopsies of lymph nodes (Heckerman et al., 1992) . The arcs between findings indicate that they are not independent, given diagnoses. Note that the Pathfinder network is a more realistic illustration of the size and complexity of the models used in diagnostic expert systems. In chapter 18, we discuss Bayesian networks in the context of Bayesian biosurveillance. That chapter discusses a really big model.",

A rule-based expert system (also known as a deterministic expert system) encodes medical knowledge in a set of if-then rules. Rule-based expert systems are simpler, conceptually, than probabilistic systems, b u t they are only appropriate for problems that do not involve reasoning under uncertainty. A rule-based formalism is appropriate when diagnostic or other knowledge can be represented as Boolean statements (e.g.,if A and B then C).A hospital or biosurveillance organization can use a rule-based expert system to automate case detection when the findings are diagnostically precise (e.g., when case-detection is based on diagnostically precise data such as a positive tuberculosis culture [Miller et al., 1997] ). Figure 13 .12 is an anthrax case detection rule from the Clinical Event Monitor, an embedded rule-based expert system developed by several of the authors (Wagner et al., 1997) . This rule is in a format that can be interpreted by a rule-based inference engine called CLIPS (National Aeronautics and Space Administration). The rule contains variables that represent findings of the disease anthrax. The part of the rule before the _> symbol is the IF part and the part after the symbol is the THEN part. If all the conditions defined in the IF segment are true--wide mediastinum is found in a chest radiograph report and gram positive rods are reported in laboratory results within 10 days of each othermthen the rule will conclude that there is a possible anthrax case. A typical rule-based expert system contains hundreds of such rules.",

In the 1970s, several research groups took this barrier seriously. They began to explore methods to embed diagnostic expert systemsm providing diagnostic support and, more generally, decision support--to clinicians without asking them to enter patient findings. Their research demonstrated that it is possible to obtain needed findings directly from existing clinical information systems (Evans, 1991 , Gardner et al., 1999 , Rind et al., 1993 , McDonald, 1976c , McDonald et al., 1992a , McDonald, 1976b , McDonald et al., 1992b , Overhage et al., 1996 (defrule detect anthrax (event Radiologyrepoa) (report (patient, id ?patient, id)) (freete~ ?freetext) (test (str-index \"wide mediasfinum\" (lowcase ?freetex~))) =3> (if(> (cCheckC~ams ?patientid \"GPR\" I 0) -1) then (event ANTHRAX) (printout t \"Found gram positive rods and widened mediastinum in chest x-ray\" crlf) (printout t ........

The research also demonstrated how diagnostic expert systems can be embedded in clinical information systems, such as physician order entry systems (Tierney et al., 1993 , Dexter et al., 2001 and electronic medical records (Gardner et al., 1999 , Warner et al., 1997 . Several of these systems functioned in the domain of hospital infection control (Hripcsak et al., 1997 , Hripcsak et al., 1999 , Kahn et al., 1996a , Kahn et al., 1996b , Kahn et al., 1993 . The secret to successful deployment of a diagnostic or other expert system in medicine is designing a system in which the benefits to clinicians (from decision support and increases in efficiency) outweigh any additional effort required by clinicians to enter data by a considerable margin.",

F I 6 O R E 13.13 Daily sum of syndrome probabilities produced by SyCO 2. SyCO 2 computes the posterior probability that a patient has a flu-like illness from his chief complaint. (From Espino, J., Dara, J., Dowling J, et al. (2005) . SyCo2: A Bayesian Machine Learning Method for Extracting Symptoms from Chief Complaints And Combining Them Using Probabilistic Case Definitions. Pittsburgh, PA: Center for Biomedical Informatics, University of Pittsburgh, with permission.) An outbreak-detection system would sum the posterior probabilities of flu-like illness from all patients seen in 24-hour periods to form a time series of expected daily counts of patients with respiratory illness. Readers familiar with Bayesian statistics will recognize this sum as the expectation for the number of individuals with a given diagnosis. This ideal approach underlies the Bayesian approach to outbreak detection described in Chapter 18 Bayesian Methods for Diagnosing Outbreaks. PANDA (Population-wide ANomaly Detection and Assessment)rathe research system described in that chapter--actually merges many individual diagnostic Bayesian networks into a very large network that also includes a subnetwork that draws inferences about the presence or absence of an outbreak. PANDA is pursuing this idea on a citywide scale. Conceptually, a PANDA network comprises millions of person-specific diagnostic Bayesian networks, each of whose probabilities of disease (e.g., anthrax) are being influenced by population-level observations (e.g., aggregate sales of over-the-counter medications) and population-level inferences (e.g., the likelihood that other individuals who may have inhalational anthrax are present in a population). PANDA also includes a prior probability distribution over outbreak diseases (e.g, the prior probability of inhalational anthrax, based on the national terror alert level). By integrating person-specific diagnostic submodels into a population-wide super model, approaches like PANDA are able to make inferences about the probability of a disease outbreak in the population as a whole, as well as the probability of disease in individual people (or subgroups of people) within the population.",

The authors of the SARS case definition intended it for use by physicians and epidemiologists, not computers. The clause \"findings of lower respiratory illness (e.g., cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing)\" does not enumerate all findings of lower respiratory illness. A computer requires a complete enumeration of all findings that it should count as evidence of lower respiratory illness (e.g., cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, wheezing, cyanosis, tachypnea, dullness to percussion, fremitus, whispered pectoriloquy, rales, and rhonchi). The findings would also have to be described more precisely. For example, a physician or an epidemiologist would not count chronic cough or cough associated with asthma as a finding of lower respiratory illness when applying this case definition, but a computer would (unless told otherwise). Note that it is difficult, if not impossible, to enumerate all of the possible exceptions to the counting of a finding as evidence of a disease. This difficulty is the reason that diagnostic expert systems in medicine are probabilistic. They quantify the number of exceptions to a categorical statement about the relationship between findings and disease using probabilities. For example, 70% of patients with cough have an acute lower respiratory illness, but 30% (the exceptions) have some other cause. This observation suggests that computerinterpretable case definitions will employ Bayesian networks, as illustrated by Figure 13 .15.",
