            "text": "Scientific paradigms are a set of accepted beliefs that are used as a solution model by a community of practitioners (3) . These logic models tend to be challenged when they fail to respond to contemporary problems. Several paradigms of thought have been recognized to be influential in the evolution of public health over the past few centuries. Throughout the 19th century, the major paradigm was that of 'miasma' -that is, that disease is transmitted through environmental vectors, namely foul emanations including atmosphere, vapour and odour. Miasmist theory was later challenged by the 'contagionists' who believed that disease was spread by organisms passed from person to person. The contagionists purported a single causative agent for any disease (3) . As bacteria were discovered, and as infectious diseases and immunization advances predominated the period, it is not surprising that the contagionists' germ theory was widely adopted as the Chronic disease burden in Canada poses an imminent public health threat. The impact of respiratory disease in Canada alone is significant, affecting one in five and leading any other cause of repeat hospitalization in all age groups. Public health action is considered to be an important means of addressing these issues. Historical understanding of health has evolved to support the adoption of paradigms by professions that recognize the limitations of medical intervention in addressing the fundamental basis of disease when compared with the broader public health perspective. Several key historical events have shaped this understanding in the Canadian context including the Lalonde and Epp reports, and public health emergencies such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003. The profession of respiratory therapy has historically existed within a medicalized paradigm of practice; however, forces both internal and external to the profession are pressuring it to consider adopting broader socialand population-based approaches. As a rapidly evolving profession, there is a need to explore emerging areas of practice opportunities in the discipline. Investigating alternative knowledge and ideology can ensure that effective strategies for addressing the contemporary respiratory heath needs of Canadians are undertaken. The present article explores the rationale for a public health-and population-based approach to health in general, and its applicability to the respiratory therapist's role in addressing respiratory health-related issues in Canada. (4), has produced interesting results that support that premise. They demonstrated that technical advances and the availability of medical care appear to have had little impact on the decline in mortality apparent in the United States throughout the 20th century (4). In fact, they reported that many of the advanced medical interventions (eg, immunization and infectious disease treatment) occurred only after substantial decline in mortality rates were apparent in many key diseases. They estimated that, at most, 3.5% of the total improvements in mortality rates apparent after 1900 could be ascribed to medical measures. In a different investigation of declining mortality rates in England and Wales (United Kingdom) through that same period, McKeown et al (5) concluded that the phenomenon was due entirely to a reduction in deaths from infectious diseases. They specifically suggested that the main influences over the decline included an improved standard of living and diet, improved hygiene standards, and favourable conditions with respect to human and microorganism interaction.",

It is also clear that, despite great advances in the understanding of microorganisms and disease, the contagionists' germ theory of one causative agent and one disease does not address the evolving health problems of our contemporary society. As is the case in Canada, since the second half of the 20th century, the health of industrialized world has been heavily burdened by chronic diseases. Out of the need to address evolving challenges, a new paradigm of public health has since evolved. The paradigm of the era of chronic disease epidemiology has focused on identifying and addressing risk factors associated with disease (3). By considering each of the risk factors that underlie chronic disease patterns, as well as the environmental influences, microbial-specific treatments and immunization strategies that have been shown to impact mortality in the face of infectious disease, it stands to reason that an approach to disease management that addresses the range of these factors would be most effective.",

There was a rising degree of affluence, improvements to social programs and the introduction of guaranteed access to acute care services through the 1957 Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act (1). These would each have a positive influence on Canadians' health; however, other factors that would have a significantly more sinister impact on health also emerged including widespread smoking, increased social drinking and recreational drug use, air pollution and injuries associated with motor vehicle use (6). Generally speaking, however, public health appeared to be taken for granted at this time and there was resistance to official messages about vaccination, tobacco, water fluoridation and automobile safety (7). After several decades of growth in Canada's health services, economic forces in the 1970s led to a period of greater scrutiny and reduced federal funding for the expansion of health care services. There was growing recognition of the fact that the substantial declines in mortality had not been prompted by medical advances, but by those influences earlier described by McKeown et al (5) . This prompted a period of renewed thinking about how to address the health of the public in Canada (7).",

These included breastfeeding initiatives, motor vehicle safety initiatives and the federal Tobacco Act, to name a few (3). While there was recognition of the importance of these population-wide initiatives to improve Canadians' health, it was likely the occurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Canada in 2003 that truly awoke Canadians to the fact that the traditional, acute care-oriented health care system was insufficient in itself to protect them from all potential health risks (1, 11) . During this crisis, the risks came unexpectedly, facilitated by the ease of modern global airline travel. A heightened understanding of the influence that ecological and social factors, globalization and a rapidly changing world can have on the health of contemporary Canadians, clarified the need to effectively coordinate efforts to address these. This understanding was a powerful force, which in part lead to the creation of the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) (12) .",

In each of these scenarios, RTs were called on to deliver acute and critical care services to Canadians such as diagnostic testing, respiratory therapeutics and, in severe cases, emergency airway management and mechanical ventilation. These types of services provided to Canadians by RTs, however, do not fully encompass the public health paradigm. Instead, these are examples of the biomedical model of care that focuses on the cause and treatment of health and disease only in terms of biological cause and effect (17) . The biomedical model has long been accepted as a predominant paradigm in respiratory therapy, and is strikingly compatible with the germ theory of disease that emanated in the late 19th century, the limitations of which have already been discussed.",

While these often occur primarily at the individual or vulnerable subpopulation level, there is also a move toward more community-level health promotion activity in respiratory therapy, one example being innovative smoking cessation programs. Also, in many health care organizations, RTs are also on the forefront of emergency preparedness planning for events such as impending influenza pandemics. Coordinated efforts such as these, often performed in association with provincial and/or federal public health officials and various community agencies, provide us with examples of the intersectoral and collaborative use of respiratory therapy expertise in real public health practice.",

For instance, considering the substantial impact that environmental issues, such as air quality and pollution, have on chronic respiratory disease, finding ways of addressing these should be priorities for RTs (18) . The adoption of readily available tools, such as the Air Quality Health Index, into practice is an example of one such opportunity (19) . Clarification of the role of the RT within existing public health units should also be explored. To more fully support individuals with chronic and infectious respiratory disease across the full continuum of care, RTs should use such a platform to support and participate in important public health initiatives such as vaccination campaigns.",
