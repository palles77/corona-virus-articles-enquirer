Although a large body of anecdotal literature exists, it is based primarily on the experiences of veterinarians and applied animal behavior practitioners. Few formal scientific studies have been performed. Few studies exist of the social behavior of most wild cat species, either in natural or captive habitats, that could provide an evolutionary basis for understanding domestic cat behavior. However, studies of feral cat colonies, which provide us with a picture of domestic cat behavior unconstrained by human ownership, coupled with the few existing formal studies of cats in the home, are beginning to provide us with real insight into the social behavior of pet cats. A summary of current knowledge from formal studies of wild, feral, and domestic house cats is provided here in an effort to help veterinarians better understand the social behavior of the cats they see in practice so that they can better advise their clients.",

Evidence in murals and tombs suggests they were well domesticated in Egypt by 4000 years ago, 2 and recent findings indicate they may have been important companions to human beings as long as 9500 years ago. 3 They are classified in the Felis or \"domestic cat\" phylogenetic group, which is considered fairly old among the Felidae at about 6 million years of age; only the Puma and Lynx lines are thought to be older. 4 Based on morphological and genetic evidence, domestic cats are allied closely with European (Felis silvestris) and African wild cats (Felis lybica), and all three often are considered subspecies (F. s. catus, F. s. sylvestris, F. s. lybica). 4, 5 Currently, domestic cats are considered most closely related to the African wild cat, and genetic studies suggest lybica diverged from the European wild cat approximately 20,000 years ago. 4, 6 ",

It rarely is seen in groups even around rich, clumped food sources, such as garbage dumps, where domestic cats often form large groups. 10 However, some evidence shows that mothers provide one another's young with food, at least in captivity; sharing of caretaking may occur in feral domestic cats, as well. 8, 9, 15 Home ranges have been measured in at least two studies: one reported a home range of 1 km 2 for one individual in open oak forest on hilly, rocky ground (Israel), and the other reported a home range of more than 1.6 to 4 km 2 for one male cat in Kenya. 8, 9 Such variation in home range also is seen in feral domestic cats. 11 The main threat to African wild cats seems to be from hybridization with domestic cats. However, at least one recent genetic study in southern Africa found existing clear genetic separation between wild and domestic cats and advises strong conservation measures to prevent hybridization from increasing. 12 Bradshaw and Cameron-Beaumont 13 and Sunquist and Sunquist 8 provide excellent summaries of signaling capabilities in undomesticated felids. Although much of the summarized data were based on studies of captive wild animals, behaviors seen commonly in the domestic cat had interesting similarities. This suggests that domesticated individuals already are primed to engage in these behaviors, whether their wild ancestors do so commonly in their natural settings.",

Both behaviors also are found in domestic cats. Tree-scratching is widespread among undomesticated and domesticated cats and may function in a number of ways (remove loose claw sheaths, deposit scent, provide a visual signal). Object-rubbing also is typical and observations have suggested at least three distinct functions for this behavior in wild and domesticated cats, including depositing scent (saliva), picking up scent (from previously urine-marked objects), and providing a visual signal of estrus. 8, 13 Acoustic communication varies in pattern across felid groups. Some sounds, such as hisses and spitting, are common in most groups, whereas others, such as purrs and meows, seem restricted, although the difficulty in hearing these quieter calls may affect the ability to study them. Both European and African wild cats in captivity are known to purr, chatter, hiss, spit, gurgle, meow, and give male and female sexual calls (such as yowls), although the data seem more reliable for European cats. 8 Roars seem to be restricted to lions.",

Group formation in felids in general, including domestic cats, seems dependent in large part on the size of prey that can be captured and the need to fend off scavengers. 10 So, for example, lions working together can take much larger prey than individuals alone and can better resist attempts by hyenas to take over a kill. However, many felids, particularly the smaller ones, do not need to take large prey to gain their necessary food intake and can hunt and eat alone. As would be expected then, feral domestic cats living on wild prey such as rabbits and rodents tend to be solitary, but those with access to clumped food sources related to human activities, such as around barns, landfills, and fishing dumps, live in groups. 10 Clearly domestic cats have a built-in flexibility in grouping behavior and are not restricted evolutionarily to being solitary. However, a trade-off seems to occur: condensing around a rich food resource may lead to an increase in disease susceptibility and the spread of pathogens. Group living may have important limits.",

More than half of the group (53 per cent) were seropositive for feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) antibodies, 96 per cent had antibodies for parvovirus (FPV), about 90 per cent had coronavirus antibodies (FCoV), and 40 to 90 per cent were infected with parasites (Toxoplasma gondii more than 45 per cent, Toxascaris leonina more than 80 per cent, Toxocara cati more than 90 per cent). Use of communal latrines (18 for the 50 to 80 individuals), rat prey populations that could serve as a reservoir for T. gondii, and communal suckling and cleaning of kittens were considered possible causes of this high pathogenicity. Clearly group living may have great costs. The benefits of being a central female (close to resources, near daughters and sisters) seem to be offset by the cost of being part of a large group, where infection can enter and spread easily. However, central individuals tended to have fewer mouth infections and wounds, perhaps because they were less likely to engage in fights and may still survive better than those on the periphery.",

They used these studies to attempt to understand how to introduce new members to existing groups and the development and treatment of behavior problems, such as \"cat bullies\" and inappropriate urination and defecation. 15 Feral cat colonies, according to Crowell-Davis, et al, 15 basically are formed when food is abundant and/or clumped, with affiliative, cooperative relationships among related females forming the core of the group. Cats in these groups can recognize colony members versus noncolony members, and nongroup individuals are not allowed to casually approach and enter a group. 15 Individuals spend time in proximity to specific others, their preferred associates, in a variety of contexts and locations, and associates can be from the same or opposite sex. When individuals in groups are intact and sexually active, males overall spend less time near one another than in groups in which all individuals are neutered, which implies sexual competition, at least between some males. However, gender does not seem to play a role in which cats spend time near each other in feral groups in which all individuals are neutered, which makes it even more clear that individual relationships play an important role in bonding, independent of sex. 15 Males may be aggressive to one another during female estrus, but that is not always the case, and males also may be preferred associates to one another. Both females and males are polygamous, each seeking out and mating with several individuals of the opposite sex, and individual recognition and familiarity seem to enhance the likelihood of some pairings over those between strangers. Females often aid each other in raising young by grooming, nursing, and guarding each other's kittens and may even engage in \"midwifing,\" when one female aids another during birth. Adults of both sexes seem to play a critical role in defending kittens and helping kittens and juveniles learn appropriate hunting and social behaviors. 15 Dominance often is considered a confusing topic in cat behavior. Building on definitions from the primate and general behavior literature, 16, 17 Crowell-Davis, et al 15 describe a subordinate as an \"individual who consistently submits or gives way to another as a consequence of prior experience with that individual, and the animal submitted to is considered to be the dominant in that dyadic relationship.\" They point out that although some species have truly linear hierarchies of dominance relationships, most animals, including mammals, do not, which makes it difficult to tell in a group who is dominant to whom. 15 Also, although dominant animals can secure resources first or drive subordinates away from resources, they do not always do so. Often subordinates notice a dominant animal and leave a situation before confrontation can occur, which makes it even more difficult for observers to tell what the animals' relationships are.",

            "text": "Cats also use sounds for communication in feral groups. These are divided into three useful working categories by Crowell-Davis, et al 15 : those made with mouth closed (purrs, trills), which are seen mostly in greeting situations; those made with mouth open but gradually closing (the typical \"meow\"), again used mostly in greetings or amicable interactions; and those made with the mouth held open (growls, yowls, snarls, hisses, spits, shrieks), which are used mostly in aggressive situations. Feral cats also have been seen to engage in a variety of other social and signaling behaviors, including nose-touch greetings, allogrooming, allorubbing (usually using head, flank, and tail), play, tail-up as a possible signal of \"friendly\" intent, and lying in physical contact during rest. 15 Olfactory communication in feral groups involves glands, urine, and feces. Glands of the head (temporal, submental, and circumoral) are rubbed against objects and other cats. Observation of placement and timing of this behavior has led to the theory that molecules are deposited that identify aspects of the colony and label specific individuals. 15 Although glands are known to exist in the perianal area and between the digits, little is known about their possible social functions. Observing feral cat colonies, it is unclear why cats deposit urine or feces in specific ways (e.g., burying feces in the core area of their home ranges but leaving them exposed on the periphery). 15 Although marking territory has been offered as a possible explanation of urine and feces deposition, Crowell-Davis, et al 15 point out that no evidence exists that cats actually defend territory (i.e., protect a piece of land). However, urine often is used by other mammals, including the larger wild cats, to convey information about estrus, provide location information about individuals and about behavior or \"emotion\" (e.g., aggression or arousal), and may play these roles in feral cat groups as well. 15 This examination of feral cat populations includes some obvious correlations to housecat behavior and valuable lessons to be learned. These lessons may be grouped into socialization issues, ability to introduce new animals to a group, grooming issues (petting), and the importance of dominance relationships. 15 In terms of socialization, feral cats have demonstrated the importance of kittens learning from their mothers and others in the group about how to interact with others and with whom to interact; that is, they are \"born with the capacity to learn species-specific social skills, but they are not born with the specific skills.\" 15 This means that cats that were found or adopted by human beings as young kittens may have missed learning important skills from their mothers. Although this may not be a problem if such a cat is kept as a single pet in the home, or if kittens found together are kept together, it may lead to major difficulties if an owner attempts to introduce a new cat. The less socialized individuals may have difficulty recognizing and using signals of greeting, dominance, or submission and may become extremely aggressive or fearful. 15 Feral cat colonies also demonstrate cohesiveness, recognition of members versus strangers, and patterns of interaction based on gender, relatedness, and age-related socialization (e.g., female-female relationships, mother-kitten relationships, and groups of kittens growing up together). A group of cats in a home mimic this pattern in many ways; for example, individuals that came into the house together as kittens, whether related or not, often maintain close relationships, sharing space, and allogrooming one another. 19 Subsequently, introducing one or more new cats into a stable group can be a major problem. Based on the feral cat research, Crowell-Davis, et al 15 recommend that pet owners who want more than one cat adopt small groups of related or young individuals, such as a mother and two kittens or a small group of related or unrelated kittens, at broad intervals. They also suggest the following: (1) building up some degree of familiarity between the group and any new, strange cat before it can be introduced, as occurs in feral groups, (2) keeping the stranger behind screen doors so odors can be exchanged, and (3) exchanging bedding and materials from resting spots.",

For example, they may allow the dominant cat to eat first or provide many litterboxes in different locations so that the dominant cat cannot monopolize all of them. 15",

The seven males and seven females were unrelated and neutered and ranged in age from 6 months to 13 years at the start of the 3-month study (approximately 336 hours of observation). The first finding was that these cats could live relatively peaceably at a density of 0.1 cat/m 2 or 113,000/km 2 , about 50 times greater than the highest densities described for feral groups outdoors (e.g., 2000 cats/km 2 ). 20 This suggests that cats are capable of dealing with social \"closeness\" in the home and do not have to be solitary, although, clearly, single cats can thrive. The 14 cats in the study group seemed to do this through space management, home ranges and favored spots, and tail signaling at a distance. These tactics provided information that could enable recipients to tailor their responses before contact was imminent, and so, for example, avoid aggression. Based on findings for feral cats, availability of resources likely also would be an important factor in behavior determination. This owner provided a food dish for each individual, spread water bowls and litterboxes throughout the house, and provided isolated food, water, and litter for individuals that did not venture far from a specific room because of illness or apparent avoidance behavior. This may have prevented dominant individuals from blocking access to important resources, although that was not tested in this study and was not obvious from simple behavior observation.",

Individuals had overlapping but individually distinct home ranges and males tended to have slightly larger home ranges than females (i.e., used slightly more rooms on a regular basis than females did), similar to feral cat groups. However, home ranges did not seem organized around particular groups of females in any obvious way, as it would be in feral groups with intact females. Ranges seemed determined instead by a combination of individual preference for particular rooms and approach/avoidance behavior between particular individuals. Little overt aggression occurred during the study, so actual fighting did not seem to be important in determining day-to-day movement. However, the oldest male, which also showed classic dominance behaviors of fighting, chasing and supplanting, had the largest adult home range. The kittens, two 6-months-olds and one 1-year-old, had the largest home ranges of all individuals at the start of the study. They used all 10 of the available spaces on a regular basis, which suggests they were interested in these areas and not prevented by others from entering them. Bernstein 21 demonstrated that home ranges are not determined strictly by interactions with other cats but are at least partly dependent on individual preference. In 68 single-cat households, only about 18 per cent of cats used all rooms available.",

However, gender, individual relationships, and developmental relationships seemed important determinants of time sharing of spots: females tended to share spots over time with specific other females, and males with specific other males. Three spots were shared by older females with a male kitten or with an adult male that had started physically sharing with the female when he was a kitten (5 years before).

Aggression seemed more related to individual relationships than to gender, age, or population density (size of home). Cats spent an average of 35 per cent of their time in close proximity (within 5 m) and male-male pairs spent the most time in close proximity, 0 to 1 m. This seems to contradict findings for feral cats, in which females are most likely to form groups.

If they do not interact well with people, the resulting problems could affect how and when they are fed, cared for, and interacted with, and ultimately whether they will be able to continue living in the home. Most studies have focused on kittens and indicate that a key period occurs between 3 and 7 weeks and that socialization of kittens to people becomes less effective if delayed much beyond 7 weeks. 24 As may be predicted from feral cat studies, kittens seem to socialize to human beings better if their mother is present. 24, 25 Less obvious are studies that find that paternity may play a role in socialization; that is, that kittens with fathers that were friendly to human beings are more likely to be friendly than kittens whose fathers were less friendly to human beings. [25] [26] [27] The suggestion is that kittens inherit traits that make them more or less friendly or perhaps more or less bold and therefore more or less willing to approach this large, novel object for interaction. The importance of individual responses to novel stimuli, independent of their dominance ranking, was supported by findings that individual cats that were high ranking in terms of social dominance (unrestricted movement) or object dominance (food or other objects) were not always the least fearful or most likely to approach novel stimuli, whether the cats were indoor restricted or free-ranging outdoor cats. 22 This study supported the contention again that individual differences play important roles in behavior and that domestic cat group structure depends on the individual characteristics of the members, a point supported by feral cat studies and the studies of cat behavior in the home discussed in the previous section. 15, 19, 21, 23 Handling of kittens by human beings plays a role in socialization, especially when contact includes talking. [25] [26] [27] [28] However, handling studies also reveal that some kittens seem resistant to change in their original types, and some friendly kittens remain friendly, whether handled or not, and some fearful kittens remain so despite handling. Certainly this finding is supported anecdotally by the many instances of people taking in feral kittens and raising them successfully as pets.",

Based on this and other studies, Siegford, Walshaw, Brunner, et al 30 have developed a relatively quick, simple, and reliable test of cat temperament for adult cats and kittens in an effort to help veterinarians, shelter staff, and others assess \"cat sociability, aggressiveness, and adaptability\" more effectively for better treatment or adoption placement. However, few studies have assessed how or why human-cat socialization may change over time, especially for adults. That is, even though anecdotal evidence for certain kinds of change in social behavior is abundant, we know little about why seemingly well-socialized friendly cats may become less friendly to human beings over time or are unfriendly to particular individuals, or why unfriendly, poorly socialized cats become more friendly over time.",

People rated Siamese and Persian breeds as more socially interesting, better behaved, and more interactive than nonpedigreed cats. These assessments were borne out by direct observation of how the responders interacted with their own pets. This suggests that selective breeding has resulted in breeds that are more predictable in their behavior and therefore better able to be assessed by owners for their value as pets. However, little work has been done beyond this, and feral cat studies do not provide any additional information; pedigreed cats rarely are mentioned.",

Women tend to be more involved in the care of cats than men 25, 34 and tend to approach cats differently, which results in different responses by the cats. 35 For example, when cats were introduced into a room in which a stranger man, woman, boy or girl was seated, human interaction made no difference in the cats' reaction. The cats were likely to approach or not at equal rates. However, they reacted differentially to people depending on how people approached them. Men tended to stay seated, whereas women usually went down to the level of the cat, which resulted in more positive interactions. Children tended to approach rather than wait for the cat to approach them, but boys usually followed the cat if it attempted to retreat, which resulted in less positive interaction. 35 One study examined attitudes of elderly versus young cat owners and found that elderly cat owners seemed more accepting of the \"independence\" of their cats than younger adults. These findings may be useful to veterinarians and shelters in several ways. For example, discussion about care may best be held with the adult female of a household, evaluation of behavior problems may include questions about the behavior of children or adolescents in a home, or men may be advised to approach and interact more with cats if problems occur. Shelters may use such information to make more appropriate matches between cats and people (e.g., perhaps matching an aloof cat with an elderly man living alone who is more likely to accept its independent nature). 30",

Human beings tended to make close approaches (within 1 m) to the cat more often than the reverse, but when the cat did initiate a close approach, person and cat stayed within 1 m for longer periods of time. Adults and children interacted differently with the cats. For example, adults vocalized toward the cat earlier in an interaction and for longer periods, whereas adolescent human beings (11 to 15 years of age) spent the least amount of time in close proximity to the cats and had the least amount of interaction. Gender played some role: women spent more time interacting with cats than men, but this was partly because women in this group were home more. These findings may serve as \"norms\" for practitioners; variations from these \"norms\" (e.g., adults working long hours, leaving adolescents home alone with pet cats for long periods) may result in problems. These may be resolved fairly readily with appropriate advising; for example, a practitioner may suggest the adolescent be taught to approach and talk to the cats periodically, rather than to follow them around or ignore them.",

These conclusions have been tempered 47, 48 by newer findings that such decimation has been demonstrated clearly only on island populations, where highly constricted habitat and high density of prey exist and that cat age and home setting (rural versus urban) are important factors that affect hunting (see Chapter 74).

In a preliminary survey of cat owners in the United States from 1993 to 2003 (mode = 1997) of 256 households with 503 cats (single and two-cat households), Bernstein found that 50 per cent of cats were being kept indoors at all times, a dramatic increase. 51a Of those allowed outdoors, only 33 per cent were unrestricted, with an additional 15 per cent allowed outdoors with restrictions, such as sitting with owners on decks, being walked on leashes, kept in the yard on a lead, or kept in small fenced-in areas. These findings are similar to those of Heidenberger, 36 who surveyed German cat owners during a similar time period, in which 55 per cent reported that cats were allowed to \"run free\" in various ways and frequencies, including some restriction outdoors.",

The FAB survey also found that hunting by cats was likely to have much less effect on prey populations than estimated previously 41, 43, 48 : only about a quarter of cats were said to hunt regularly (determined by direct observation or from prey being brought in), and hunting activity was most prevalent only in young cats, peaking between 4 and 7 years of age and decreasing dramatically in older cats (which were 60 times less likely to hunt than 2-yearolds). Further, cats in rural homes were almost twice as likely to hunt as cats in urban settings, again decreasing the estimates of the number of prey being taken. 43, 48 Missing from this discussion are formal studies of whether cats kept primarily or fully indoors are more prone to develop behavioral and other problems. Aside from the surveys by Heidenberger 36 and FAB, 48 few formal sources of information exist regarding this issue. Both studies found that owners were more likely to complain of problems if cats were kept indoors or only rarely or irregularly allowed outside. In the FAB survey, 48 cats that were not allowed outside were one-and-a-half times more likely to exhibit indoor toileting problems and more than twice as likely to engage in indoor spraying. Applied behavior practitioners and anecdotal sources are additional important sources of information about this issue, especially in providing treatment guidance based on experience. But the information must be sought out.",

Because getting food from owners is an important aspect of pet cat behavior, especially if cats are kept indoors, it would seem critical to examine how cats and people manage this interaction, where communication and manipulation by one or both parties may play important roles. Bradshaw and Cook 49 observed the behavior of 36 cats during feeding to gain an overview of cat behavior in this setting and the role of cat personality. Not surprisingly, cats spent much of the premeal period interacting with the owner and using communication signals such as meow, tail-up, and rubbing. Much of the post-meal time was spent grooming, with much less interaction with the owner. Human behaviors were not studied, however, and coordination was not examined.",

Although cats allogroom one another and people touch one another, petting is a human-cat interaction in which both parties must find ways to modify species-typical behavior. Both parties seek the interaction and therefore must enjoy it. But few studies have examined directly how the interaction is initiated, maintained, and ended. Instead, various pieces have been examined. Some studies have focused primarily on areas of the body petted most often by human beings or that seem preferred by the cats, 52, 53 with some examination of the behaviors cats used to initiate the interaction ( Figure  71-3) . A group of studies also sought to determine what owners gain emotionally from petting their cats; that is, whether petting provides emotional support for people by elevating their mood as it seems to in human-dog interactions. [54] [55] [56] Results indicated that cats seemed to help decrease negative mood but did not seem predictably to put owners in a good mood. 24, 54, 56 Some information about initiation of petting by both parties also was provided. At least one study dealt with duration of the interaction and found most were less than a minute. 34 Because petting can be a strongly positive or somewhat negative interaction for people (i.e., when it results in cat aggression), 57 more research about this interaction and its affect on cat behavior in the home would be beneficial.",

Also, contactseeking behavior other than petting (e.g., sleeping with owner, Figure 71 -3.

Although petting often seems to involve areas that are allogroomed commonly by other cats, and hence may resemble cat-cat interactions, some petting activity seems specific to human-cat interaction. Here Tiger is petted on the lower abdomen, an area for which she often solicits petting and during which she remains in place and does not scratch or bite.

Not surprisingly, experienced owners were somewhat better than those with less experience, but they, too, were only somewhat better than chance. This suggests the calls have low predictive value or people have not learned them well. A related study demonstrated that human beings could classify wild cat and domestic cat vocalizations in emotional terms (e.g., pleasant, unpleasant) and discriminate reliably between them on that basis. These observations suggested that some physical aspects of domestic cat vocalizations (e.g., frequency, sound quality) may have been selected adaptively to elicit positive responses from people. 62 Sometimes the human-cat relationship goes terribly wrong, which results in behavior problems, abuse of various kinds (see Chapter 73), hoarding, relinquishment, or abandonment. Growth in interest and research in these topics has been explosive in the last decade. Major veterinary societies have suggested strategies, set policy, and formed consortia to investigate these issues further. [63] [64] [65] ",
