Viruses can be transmitted due to latent or active infection in the donor at the time of donation; rarely, donor infection is very acute and transmission occurs during the incubation period of infection, before symptoms or other evidence of infection can arise, for example, when the donor is transfused with infected blood near the time of death. Clinical consequences of infection in the transplant recipient depend on the virulence of the infecting pathogen, immune status of the recipient to the pathogen in question, and level of host immunosuppression, among other factors. Immunocompromised patients may have unusual presentations of infection, and even organisms of low virulence may cause high morbidity and mortality in these recipients.",

Transplantation of an organ from an infected donor is at the discretion of the transplant center and transplanting surgeon. The most commonly recognized transplant-transmitted pathogens are the herpesviruses (e.g., HSV, VZV, CMV, EBV, human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8)), hepatitis viruses (e.g., HBV, HCV), and retroviruses (e.g., human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)), although transmission of HIV is now unusual given current screening using nucleic acid testing (NAT). Most notable are infections that are either emerging in donor populations, or are otherwise unusual in causing illness in transplant patients. Many of these pathogens are zoonotic in nature. Some examples include West Nile virus (WNV), rabies, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) ( Table 1) .",

The risk of infection through transfusion has been greatly reduced by blood donor screening initiated by NAT in 2003, although rarely, breakthrough infections can still occur. Subsequently, there has been an additional report of transplant transmission from a donor who likely acquired infection by mosquito in 2005; in that investigation, the donor was found to be IgM positive, indicating evidence of recent acquisition of infection, but viremia could not be detected by NAT. WNV infection has also been suspected to be transmitted through HSCT. Meningitis and encephalitis of unknown etiology in a patient recently post-transplant should cause clinicians to consider transplant transmission of WNV. Although WNV neuroinvasive disease occurs in less than 1% of WNV infections overall, transplant patients who acquire infections have an estimated 40-fold risk for developing neuroinvasive disease compared with the general population.",

Some viruses are metabolically inactive when latent, while others continue to replicate at low levels that may be determined by the effectiveness of the host's immune response. Multiple factors contribute to viral reactivation after transplantation, including graft rejection and therapy, immune suppression (especially reduction of T-cell mediated, cytotoxic immunity), inflammation, and tissue injury. Numerous cellular pathways are involved in the control of viral replication and are activated after transplantation, such as nuclear factor kB, IkB, and JAK-STAT (the Janus family of protein tyrosine kinases (JAKS) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins). Antirejection therapy can also result in a significant release of pro-inflammatory cytokines which may increase viral replication. In general, reactivation of viruses, especially late after transplantation, should suggest new immune defects (e.g., cancer) or relative over-immunosuppression.",

In general, latency is considered to be the absence of viral replication, with viral genomes present in the cell without replication or spread. Studies of other viruses, such as Friend virus in mice, suggest that protective antiviral immunity is an active process mediated by 'leaky' (low-level) viral replication. The existence of true latency, as opposed to low-level replication, remains controversial. Herpesviruses make 'latency' proteins that both control viral persistence within the target cell and influence other cellular processes. The latent state is characterized by low levels or the absence of detectable viral antigens, minimal transcription of productive or lytic cycle genes, and expression of the latencyassociated viral transcripts. Viral latency may be occasionally interrupted, leading to reactivation and spread of infectious virus with or without recurrent disease. EBV establishes latency in B lymphocytes in association with expression of a limited set of viral genes. Immune control of HSV infection and replication occurs at the level of skin or mucosa during initial or recurrent infection and in the dorsal root ganglion, where latency and reactivation are controlled by immune mechanisms mediated by interferons, myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, CD4(\u00fe) and CD8(\u00fe) T cells, and other cytokines. Despite similarities, the molecular details and mechanisms of latency and reactivation vary considerably among the herpesviruses. Mechanisms responsible for maintenance of latency are unclear.",

Thus, immune injury, inflammatory cytokines, and ischemia-reperfusion injury stimulate viral replication and change expression of virus-specific cell-surface receptors. The hosts' direct pathway antiviral cellular immune response within allografts is less effective due to mismatched major histocompatibility antigens between the organ donor and host with dependence on indirect pathways of antigen presentation.

HHV-6, for example, commonly reactivates with immunosuppression, especially after HSCT, often with clinically significant infection.

In addition, viral infection may alter the expression of cell-surface antigens (e.g., major histocompatibility antigens) provoking graft rejection and/or cause disregulated cellular proliferation (contributing to atherogenesis in cardiac allografts, obliterative bronchiolitis in lung transplantation, or to oncogenesis). Increased viral replication and persistence may contribute to allograft injury (fibrosis) or chronic rejection. Infection with one virus may stimulate replication of other viruses in a form of viral 'cross talk'. As was noted above, infection with HHV-6 and/or HHV-7 serve as risk factors for CMV disease and vice versa. The direct and indirect effects of HHV-6 reactivation can be significant: HHV-6 infection is associated with high levels of IL-6 and TNF-a, and in pediatric renal or bone marrow transplantation, HHV-6 reactivation is strongly associated with acute rejection. Co-infection with HCV and CMV predicts an accelerated course for hepatitis. Co-infection with CMV and EBV increases the risk for post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) by 12-20-fold. A more theoretical concern is that T-cell responses against viral infections are thought to produce cross-reacting immune responses against graft antigens, possibly via 'alternative recognition' within the T-cell receptor. This cross-reactivity is termed 'heterologous immunity' and may provoke abrogation of graft tolerance.",

HSV-1 and -2 (HHV-1 and -2) usually cause oral and genital ulceration, although it may occur in more unexpected areas as well. Recurrent disease can be problematic for some patients and warrants consideration of secondary prophylaxis with antiviral therapy. VZV (HHV-3) is common with an incidence of herpes zoster among 869 patients after SOT of 8.6% (liver 5.7%, renal 7.4%, lung 15.1%, and heart 16.8%), with a median time of onset 9.0 months, as reported by Razonable et al. in 2005. After allogeneic HSCT, in one study by Koc et al. 41 of 100 (41%) developed VZV reactivation a median of 227 days (range 45-346 days) post-transplantation. Both primary and disseminated VZV infection can be lethal in these populations. Nonimmune transplantation patients should be monitored carefully after exposure to clinical varicella and the use of antiviral therapy or varicella immunoglobulin for prophylaxis should be considered. EBV (HHV-4) can cause febrile systemic illness, lymphocytosis, leukopenia, hepatitis, and mediates post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). PTLD constitutes a spectrum of disease, which is often responsive to reduced immunosuppression in previously immune hosts. EBV-seronegative individuals with primary infection after transplantation are at increased risk for EBV-mediated PTLD. The clinical presentation of CMV (HHV-5) can range from a 'CMV syndrome' including fever, malaise, leukopenia, to a 'flu-like' illness with myalgias and fatigue, to a more significant end-organ disease with pneumonitis, colitis, encephalitis, hepatitis, or chorioretinitis.

Preliminary studies suggest that both patient and graft survival are similar in HIV-negative and HIV-positive kidney and liver transplantation recipients. However, HCV infection appears to be accelerated even in controlled HIV infection. Ongoing multicenter trials of transplantation in HIV infections are continuing. Drug interactions between the immunosuppressive regimen and antiretroviral drugs necessitate careful monitoring. The profound and long-lasting suppression of the CD4\u00fe T-cell count in patients who receive thymoglobulin induction therapy has been associated with an increased risk of infections requiring hospitalization.",

Serologic assays are generally less sensitive in transplant patients, as humoral immune responses may be delayed or absent. In one series, 29% of patients with parvovirus B19 infection as shown by PCR assay had a negative IgM assay. Quantitative molecular tests allow the optimization and individualization of antiviral therapies for prevention and treatment of infection. This advance is most significant in the management of CMV, EBV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C viruses, where quantitative assays (such as viral loads or antigenemia tests) guide antiviral therapy. Nonquantitative (i.e., qualitative) assays are less useful in management as they do not assess responses to therapy and cannot differentiate primary infection, from reactivation or reinfection. For example, chromosomal integration of latent HHV-6 DNA (which happens in 1-3% of immunocompetent subjects) leads to high levels of viral DNA, whether or not the infection is active; one group concludes that any diagnosis of HHV-6 encephalitis should not be made without first excluding chromosomal HHV-6 integration by measuring DNA load in CSF, serum and/or whole blood. Latent infections due to EBVand CMV may be qualitatively positive by PCR, confirming the need for quantitative assays.",

In this regard, histologic evaluation of tissues using pathogen-specific immunohistochemistry may augment systemic assays. Patients with CMV colitis, for example, may have negative molecular or antigenemia blood assays for CMV. In addition, patients may shed CMV in secretions without true infection, limiting the diagnostic capacity of a positive culture. BK polyomavirus may be detectable in the urine (either by cytology, looking for the classic decoy cells, or by PCR) before it is detectable in the blood, providing a window of opportunity for reducing immunosuppression possibly in advance of invasive disease. Adenovirus may be detectable in local infections, such as cystitis, with negative blood assays.",

The overall level of immunosuppression has a major impact on both the risk of reactivation of latent infection and the ability to clear such an infection. Reducing the immunosuppressive regimen during active viral infection can be a major contribution toward clearing infection, although it presents a risk of graft rejection. As protective cytotoxic immunity to viruses is generally T-cell (CD8\u00fe) mediated, an initial reduction of antimetabolites (if neutropenic) and calcineurin inhibitors merits consideration. In contrast, a reduction of the steroid dose during the acute phase of a febrile illness may cause acute adrenal insufficiency.",

The toxicity of some agents (such as cidofovir, foscarnet, and ribavirin) may complicate management, notably in the face of reduced renal function in patients receiving calcineurin inhibitors as part of the immunosuppressive regimen. The duration of therapy is often longer in transplant patients than in normal hosts, and often reflects the ability to reduce the overall level of immunosuppression, that is. less immunosuppression may result in a shorter treatment time. The increased information provided by molecular diagnostics may allow for more directed treatment regimens. Antiviral therapy is often used for prophylaxis in the post-transplantation period, especially for individuals at risk for primary infection. In general, acyclovir and related agents are used to prevent HSV and VZV and ganciclovir or valganciclovir to prevent CMV as well as HSV and VZV. The relative advantages of universal prophylaxis (i.e., the use of antiviral medication in all susceptible patients for a period after transplantation) or monitoring with preemptive (early) therapy remain to be established. Meta-analyses suggest that universal prophylaxis with antiviral medications in SOT recipients reduces CMV disease and CMV-associated opportunistic infections, graft rejection, and mortality; their use is recommended for high risk individuals (CMVpositive recipients and in CMV-negative recipients of CMV-positive organs). Some studies indicate that universal prophylaxis and preemptive therapy are effective in reducing the incidence of CMV disease. In the HSCT setting, where the risks of bone marrow toxicity from valganciclovir are higher, many programs choose to use preemptive monitoring and therapy for CMV.",

Immunoglobulins (i.e., intravenous immune globulins (IVIG), CMV, and HBV hyper-immune globulins (both prepared from plasma preselected for high titer antibodies to CMV and HBV, respectively), as well as monoclonal antibodies such as those for RSV) have been helpful in preventing and treating viral infections, likely due to both direct and indirect immunomodulatory properties. A significant percent of patients have post-transplantation hypogammaglobulinemia, which has been linked to increased mortality and may benefit from globulin repletion. This may be most apparent in the setting of active infections, as well as prophylaxis. Immunostimulatory agents, such as interferon-alpha used to treat hepatitis C, can be helpful at treating the viral infection but may perturb the relationship between the graft and the host, precipitating rejection. Reversal of neutropenia can be done using colony stimulating factors such as G-CSF, which is generally well tolerated in sold organ transplantation patients.",

Live viral vaccines such as attenuated influenza (delivered by nasal spray), measles, mumps, rubella, varicella (both Varivax, for protection against varicella in nonimmune subjects, as well as Zostavax, for protection against zoster), yellow fever, oral polio, and vaccinia (smallpox) should generally be avoided after SOT and in patients who are chronically immunosuppressed (such as those with GVHD); some may be given after HSCT.
