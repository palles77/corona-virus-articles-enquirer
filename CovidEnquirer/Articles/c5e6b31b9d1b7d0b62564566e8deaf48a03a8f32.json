Specimen collection is guided that nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs are collected from the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal walls, respectively, not just from the nostril or mouth. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs could be placed in the same viral transport medium. Synthetic fiber flocked swabs with plastic shafts should be used to increase virus yield. Calcium alginate swabs or swabs with wooden shafts are not recommended because they may contain substances that inactivate some viruses and inhibit PCR reactions. In asymptomatic individuals, induced sputum or forced coughing may help collect lower respiratory tract specimens.

Because a total of 16,693 people were self-quarantined owing to contact history with confirmed MERS-CoV cases, investigation of seroprevalence in this population is necessary in order to understand the epidemiology and pathophysiology of MERS-CoV infection [2] . It is recommended that serum samples be collected during the acute stage of the disease, preferably during the first week after illness onset and again during convalescence, at least 14 to 21 days after the acute stage sample was collected. If the acute stage sampling is missed, it should be collected at least 14 days after the onset of symptoms [4, 11] .",

If nucleic acid extraction cannot be performed within 72 hr after collection, specimens should be stored at -70\u00b0C or lower as soon as possible after collection. MERS-CoV RNA should be extracted by using appropriate manual or automated nucleic acid extraction methods. For example, the QIAamp DSP Viral RNA Mini kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany) is one of the most widely used manual extraction methods, and the NucliSENS easyMAG (bioM\u00e9rieux, Durham, NC, USA), MagNA Pure 96 System (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), and QIAcube (QIAGEN) are commonly used automated nucleic extraction methods. Nucleic acid extraction from sputum, tracheal aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavage, nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs, or blood should be performed according to the manufacturers' instructions. RNA samples should be stored at -70\u00b0C or lower. Practically, rRT-PCR assays targeting upE are recommended for screening (Fig. 1) . If the upE screening assay is positive, an independent, confirmatory rRT-PCR assay targeting ORF1a should be performed. Laboratory developed tests and commercial kits for rRT-PCR assay should be used with provision of positive control and validation by LR-TF.",
