            "text": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the most important infectious disease problems in the United States today and accounts for major morbidity and mortality. 1 There were approximately 4.5 million ambulatory care visits in 2007 in the United States 1 and an estimated 1.1 million hospitalizations for pneumonia, with an average length of stay of 5 days. 2 CAP accounts for enormous health care costs, with an estimated $17 billion price tag annually in the United States. 3 Unfortunately, in the past 20 to 25 years, with improved broad-spectrum antibiotics, the implementation of diagnostic studies has declined and most patients do not have an etiologic pathogen of CAP identified. 1, 4, 5 This has been partially because of the advance of antimicrobial agents to treat CAP, resulting in a lack of the perceived need to know the etiologic pathogen, unless the patient does not respond to empiric therapy. 1 An important consideration of the diagnosis of CAP is the age and immune state of the patient. Severe and fatal disease can occur in the elderly, the immunocompromised, the very young, and those individuals with conditions that affect cardiopulmonary function, and these syndromes can be caused by multiple types of organisms, which may be etiologically indistinguishable on presentation. 6 The elderly represent an important factor in rapid diagnosis of CAP especially because this older generation is increasing in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) statistics indicate that, although pneumonia rates have been decreasing, hospitalization for the age group older than 85 years still represents the most vulnerable population (Fig. 1) . 7 From 2000 to 2010, the hospitalization rate for pneumonia per 100,000 population decreased by 20% for the total population. The rate decreased 30% among those aged 65 to 74 years, 31% among those aged 75 to 84 years, and 33% among those aged 85 years and older. However, throughout the period, the rate of hospitalization for 85 years and older was the highest, whereas the younger than 65 years age group was substantially lower than the rate for any other age group. Thus, accurate and rapid diagnosis of CAP is important for appropriate patient management, especially in the elderly.",

Sensitive, specific, and rapid identification of viruses and bacteria that cause CAP can enhance the appropriate use of antiviral agents and prevent overuse of antibiotics. Thus, being able to diagnose respiratory viruses and bacterial pathogens is an integral part of patient management today in the era of cost containment and antibioticsparing paradigms for CAP and other respiratory infections that are not of a bacterial origin. Several new molecular platforms exist today for identification of respiratory viruses, and some new broad-based platforms are on the horizon for the diagnosis of viruses, bacteria, and fungi. 8, 9 Although accurate diagnosis is highly desirable, perhaps more important is the rapid diagnosis of an etiologic agent of CAP, which can affect immediate patient management. Such rapid identification of a viral agent can prevent the use of unnecessary antibiotics; reduce costs; facilitate timely, effective use of antiviral drugs for viral etiologies, such as influenza; and ultimately may shorten hospital stays.",

            "text": "The real question for optimal and rapid patient care, however, is whether the etiologic agent of CAP is bacterial or viral, and if it is bacterial, whether it is gram-positive or gram-negative. Answers in real time can direct agent-specific therapy and avoid overuse of precious broad-spectrum antibiotics. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and molecular tests, which have been developed for the past 20 years and have been coexisting with routine microbiology culture, have not been widely adopted, contributing little to rapid decision making for patient care, especially for bacteria, because many of them are laboratory-developed tests (LDTs), which are not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared or commercially available. Urinary pathogen nonmolecular FDA-cleared diagnostic assays for S pneumonia and Legionella are an exception, because their results are rapidly available. 10, 11 With single-pathogen molecular tests, each test requires the suspicion of a particular pathogen, but with the development of multiple-pathogen molecular assays, particularly for viruses, the tools to advance pathogen-directed therapy may now exist. 12 This article focuses on recently developed molecular multiplex diagnostic assays and platforms, many of which are FDA-cleared, and how their use can enhance and improve the management of CAP. It provides an overview of the FDA-cleared rapid nonmolecular tests compared with the new rapid molecular tests for the diagnosis of influenza, other respiratory viruses, and bacteria, with less emphasis on those molecular tests that are not FDA-cleared, because they offer clinicians less acute medical management tools, except in research studies. Many of these FDA-cleared and noncleared assays have also been recently reviewed in great detail elsewhere. 6, [12] [13] [14] Requirements of Molecular Assays that can Affect Patient Care Advances in molecular diagnostic methods, which can improve management of CAP, dictate that the result be (1) rapid, (2) accurate, and (3) have the capability to detect multiple pathogens in one assay or a minimum of assays.Rapid POC assays are especially attractive and almost imperative because Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society guidelines recommend that it is very important that therapy for hospitalized patients be as soon as possible and that the first antibiotic dose be given in the emergency department (ED). 15, 16 These guidelines drive how rapidly a molecular test can be performed and returned to the clinician in the ED.",

            "text": "RADTs for influenza are FDA-cleared. RADTs have highly variable sensitivities (10%-75%) and specificities (50%-100%) depending on the viral target, age of the patient, sample collection, and duration of symptoms before testing. In general, RADTs perform better when testing pediatric samples, because children shed higher titers of virus and for longer time periods than adults. RADTs also perform better during periods of high prevalence (influenza seasons). They did not perform well for the detection of pandemic swine H1N1 viruses. 14,24-26 Chartrand and colleagues 14 recently provided an excellent meta-analysis describing their performance from 159 studies and reported a pooled sensitivity of 62.3% and a specificity of 98.2%. Performance was better for influenza A (64.6%) than influenza B (52.2%). There are 14 FDA-cleared RADTs available commercially, of which five are Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) waived; two of these can detect and distinguish between influenza A and B. 26 Development of more CLIA-waived assays with increased accuracy and better ability to accurately differentiate influenza types and subtypes will improve use and clinical management decisions in CAP. 26, 27 Direct fluorescent antibody Rapid DFA testing of centrifuged sediments nasopharyngeal swabs of viral transport media can readily detect seven of the common respiratory viruses (adenovirus; influenza A and B; parainfluenza virus [PIV] 1, 2, and 3; and respiratory syncytial virus [RSV] ). In addition, DFA testing can detect hMPV. The specificity of DFA testing is high, but the sensitivities can vary from a low of 50% to 80% when compared with nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). Because DFA testing can be performed in as little as 30 to 60 minutes, its use is ideal for POC tests if the laboratory is located near the clinic ordering the test, but a skilled microscopist is required and thus use is limited to performance in a clinical laboratory. Although the seven viruses are responsible for a large number of respiratory tract infections, other viruses are also important causes of respiratory disease. These include bocavirus, selected coronaviruses (229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU-1), PIV 4, and rhinovirus. They are only detected using PCR or NAATs. 25 Types of DFA The Diagnostic Hybrid method (Diagnostic Hybrids, Athens, OH) consists of staining a cell pellet from a respiratory sample, such as a nasopharyngeal swab sample, in liquid transport media after centrifugation with a monoclonal antibody mixture, which is a pool of antibodies for seven viruses (influenza A and B, RSV, PIV 1 to 3, and adenovirus). Another cell spot is stained with a monoclonal for hMPV. If the pool stains positive by fluorescent microscopy, the cell pellet is stained individually with each monoclonal to determine which virus is staining in the pool. This is a very efficient, rapid (w2-4 hours), and cost-effective method to screen respiratory samples because about 90% are negative. The disadvantage is that a fluorescent microscope and a skilled microscopist are required. Sensitivity is approximately 80% to 85% and specificity is excellent in a skilled laboratory. An advantage is that all the negative samples can be screened in one pool with a single microscopic visual screen with the pool reagent. It is difficult to use as a POC test unless the laboratory is in very close proximity to the ED or clinic.",

The original FDA-approved version of RVP detected adenovirus, influenza A (with subtyping of seasonal influenza A/H1 and seasonal influenza A/H3), influenza B, PIV 1 to 3, hMPV, rhinovirus, RSV A and B, and was approved for use with nasopharyngeal swabs from symptomatic persons. 29, 30 Currently, the RVP is an FDA-approved, multiplexed RT-PCR assay manufactured by Luminex (Toronto, Canada) for the detection of 12 viral targets in a single specimen: influenza A; influenza A, subtype H1; influenza A, subtype H3; influenza B; RSV A and B; PIV 1 to 3; hMPV; rhinovirus; and adenovirus. It is FDA-cleared for nasopharyngeal swabs, nasal washes, or bronchoalveolar lavage samples. It requires roughly 8 to 10 hours processing and running the assay. There is a second-generation assay called RVP FAST (Luminex) only available in Europe (not FDA-cleared in the United States) that reduces the number of steps and the time to results by 3 to 4 hours. This assay is intended for use in only CLIA high-complexity laboratories. It has been shown to be highly sensitive and specific for respiratory viruses. 31 It has been compared with the FilmArray respiratory panel. 32 Respiratory virus plus, Verigene Respiratory Virus Nucleic Acid Test The firstgeneration Verigene Respiratory Virus Nucleic Acid Test (Nanosphere, Northbrook, IL) was cleared by the FDA in May 2009.

The Verigene System consists of two instruments (the fully automated Verigene Processor and the Verigene Reader) and single-use test cartridges, random access work flow. The entire test process only requires one user pipetting step, less than 5 minutes of technical hands-on time, and a sample-to-result turnaround time of about 2.5 hours. Test sensitivities and specificities for the detection of influenza A were 100% and 99.8%, respectively; for influenza B they were 100% and 99.1%, respectively; and for RSV they were 95.7% and 98.2%, respectively. This assay is CLIA moderate complexity, and a trained laboratory technician must perform the test. It is adequate for small-to medium-sized laboratories. Limitations of the assay include the single-test format that requires a dedicated processor for each sample for 3 to 3.5 hours. 33 The H275Y mutation for oseltamivir resistance panel is only available outside the United States.",

The automated system enables the detection of numerous viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens in a single test. The required reagents for the assay are enclosed in the single-use pouch. Water is added to hydrate the lyophilized reagents and the respiratory specimen is added. The pouch is loaded into the FilmArray instrument, and the remainder of the test is completely automated. After extraction of nucleic acid, a nested PCR reaction is performed within the pouch in an entirely closed system. The first-step PCR is a multiplexed reaction containing primers for all of the viral and bacterial targets; the amplicons from the first PCR are then diluted, and a second round of PCR reactions is performed in a multiwell array, each well containing a single primer set targeting a specific pathogen. Both amplification and melt curve analysis allow the FilmArray software to generate a result for each target. 34 The system is very robust, detecting a low concentration of pathogen in the presence of a high concentration of a second pathogen, with results available in 1 hour. When compared with laboratory-developed real-time PCR assays for the detection of various respiratory viruses and certain bacterial pathogens on a total of 215 frozen archived pediatric respiratory specimens previously characterized as either negative or positive for one or more pathogens by real-time PCR examined using the FilmArray RP system, the overall agreement between the FilmArray RP and corresponding real-time PCR assays for shared analytes was 98.6% (kappa 5 0.92; 95% CI, 0.89-0.94). 35 Rand and colleagues 32 compared FilmArray RP and the xTAG RVP multiplex respiratory virus PCR methods for the detection of respiratory viruses in a set of 200 patient specimens frozen at \u00c070 C after standard viral culture and antigen detection methods had been performed. Both systems detected between 40% and 50% more viruses than traditional methods, which were mostly rhinoviruses and hMPV. The FilmArray RP detected significantly more total viruses either alone or as part of mixed infections than the xTAG RVP, and an additional 21.6% more RSVs. The xTAG RVP required 5 to 6 hours with 2.5 to 3 hours of hands-on time, whereas the FilmArray RP took about an hour with 3 to 5 minutes of hands-on time.",

The advantage is that it is FDA-cleared and can meet the requirements for an accurate POC test for influenza for a POC assay for a clinic or ED or out-patient setting. The POC assay could eventually allow POC testing in clinics by minimally trained health care workers, if the assay becomes CLIA waived. Pandemic 2009 influenza A virus and H3N2 (including H2N2v), seasonal H1N1, and influenza B can be identified. One, or two, four 16, samples, can be run simultaneously; or 64 samples can be run if larger random access equipment is used. The test time is approximately 1 hour.

An excellent review of the literature that discusses the advantages and limitations of the relatively new platform has been published. 12 Thus far, several publications point to its usability for identification of a broad range of viral respiratory pathogens.

The evolution of the noncleared PCR assays and the challenges in the interpretation of these assays are discussed in an excellent review by Blaschke. 23 Early assays targeted the pneumolysin gene, but showed rather poor sensitivity and specificity because of cross-reactivity with viridians streptococci. 88 A comparison of several genes as targets for PCR indicted that the autolysis (lyt) gene was the most specific target. 89 Sheppard and colleagues 90 demonstrated the specificity of this target in clinical samples. Progress is being made with regard to distinguishing carriage or colonization from pneumonia by detecting the colonization density using real-time PCR. 91",

Some of these include: More research is required before accurate and rapid assays are available, especially for the FDA clinical trials clearing them for routine use, and comparisons involving the newer POC molecular assays, which now have the potential to influence immediate management decisions for CAP. The Infectious Diseases Society of America has stated that \"Better, rapid molecular diagnostic tests are an unmet need for respiratory tract infections.\" 57 FDA-cleared assays are especially needed for the rapid diagnosis of S pneumoniae. More research is required to ascertain the ability of rapid molecular identification of genetic markers to predict antibiotic and antiviral resistance, which may be the next generation of new assays. More research is needed to define the role of highly multiplexed assays that can identify hundreds of organisms to know how they can be implemented, especially in light of cost-containment issues in medicine. Lastly, clinicians have to consider the role of antimicrobial stewardship in improving outcomes of patients with CAP (eg, changing, de-escalation, and duration of antimicrobials) and whether molecular diagnostic tools play a role in changing therapy when the etiologic agent is identified. 96 ",
