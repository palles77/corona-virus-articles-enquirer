            "text": "Since their initial description (Kohler and Milstein, 1975) monoclonal antibodies have made a profound impression on all areas of biological research and biotechnology. The basic property of a monoclonal antibody, that of combining specifically with one epitope (or family of related epitopes), can be used to supply a wealth of data. A single monoclonal antibody can provide information on protein \"relatedness,\" structure, function, synthesis, processing, cellular or tissue distribution and on the association between molecules. Any attempt to separate the ways in which these data are gathered must be to some extent artificial since one study frequently yields results relevant to other areas. However, it is appropriate to differentiate between the broad areas of virological investigation. The contribution of monoclonal antibodies within each area can then be assessed. Thus, diagnostic virology, taxonomy, and epidemiology (Section 11) can be considered separately from the biochemical and molecular biological investigations described in Section 111; Section IV deals with the interaction of virus and host at the whole organism level. Consequently, the selection of virus variants is dealt with in Section I11 where information concerning protein structure or function has been obtained, and also in Section IV where pathogenesis was investigated. It is not intended in this review to provide an exhaustive list of all publications in which monoclonal antibodies have been used, but rather to illustrate how monoclonal antibodies can be applied in virology. Other reviews of different aspects have recently been published (Antczak, 1982; Blann, 1981; Kennett, 1981; Nowinski et al., 1983; Sinkovics and Dreesman, 1983; Yewdell and Gerhard, 1981) .",

This has been recently reviewed (Gerhard et al., 1980) . It is, however, necessary to consider the production of the immunogen, since it may be necessary to enrich for, or preferentially expose, a particular antigen. Thus, in the production of measles virus-specific antibodies (Bohn et al., 1982) , heating of the antigen in the presence of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) led to the derivation of antibodies specific for the matrix (M) protein. Similar treatment in the presence of reducing agents favoured the production of antibodies directed to the phosphoprotein (P) and nucleocapsid protein (N). If the protein against which monoclonal antibodies are desired is sufficiently immunogenic, it is not necessary to use pure preparations. Whole cell antigen was used in the production of antibodies directed against respiratory syncitial virus (RSV) (CGte et al., 1981) and against polyoma virus T antigen (Dilworth and Griffin, 1982) . Also, if cross reacting, e.g., group specific antibodies are required, it is possible to perform the primary inoculation with one antigen, and the boosting inoculation with the cross reacting antigen (Gerhard et al., 1978) .",

            "text": "It is not appropriate to consider here the immunological techniques used in detail, but the interested reader is referred to a review of techniques used in conjunction with polyclonal sera (van Regenmortel, 1981) . However, it is relevant to consider the limitations of these processes when applied to monoclonal antibodies. First, the majority of monoclonal antibodies dc not cause immunoprecipitation of the antigen with which they combine. This may be related to the fact that only one epitope is recognized per molecule. Consequently, extensive cross linking and stabilization of immune complexes is not possible. Therefore, immunoprecipitation by monoclonal antibodies requires the addition of a cross-linking agent such as staphylococcus protein A or antiimmunoglobulin. The antigen is only retained by one binding site and only the most strongly combining monoclonal antibodies will succeed. This problem may be diminished in the case of a multimeric protein. Second, most immune precipitation procedures involve the use of detergent in the precipitation buffer. This is necessary to prevent nonspecific contamination of the precipitate. However, this detergent will have some destabilizing effect on protein structure. Monoclonal antibodies are often sensitive to minor conformational change (Section II1,B) and consequently may be rendered nonreactive in this test. It may be necessary to experiment with detergent type and concentration in order to achieve satisfactory precipitation. The specificity of monoclonal antibodies, compared with hyperimmune serum, is illustrated in Fig. 1 . The adverse effect of alterations in protein conformation may be aggravated in western blot procedures where antigens are often totally denatured for separation on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)polyacrylamide gels before testing with antibody (Towbin et al., 1979) . However, the method does have applications (Braun et al., 1983; Roseto et al., 1983) . Immune precipitation is not suitable for quantitation of antigens. This type of information is extracted from radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). These processes are exten-sively applied during the initial screening for successful production of monoclonal antibodies, in diagnostic virology (Section I1,A) or in a modified form in competitive binding assays (Section 111). These procedures score only the combination of antibody and antigen and give no information on the nature of that antigen. Detergent conditions are frequently milder than those used in immunoprecipitation, but the attachment of antigen to the solid support necessary in many cases for these tests can itself result in conformational alteration (Bruck et al., 1982a) .",

Indeed this approach greatly exceeds conventional serology in specificity, and has led to the recognition of differences between viruses previously thought identical. Monoclonal antibodies are capable of detecting differences of one amino acid, formerly only demonstrated by recourse to peptide fingerprinting or oligonucleotide mapping of the viral genome. This approach has therefore revolutionized the techniques of virus identification, providing in many cases a simplification in the test procedure and yielding a more rapid result. Used in this way, monoclonal antibodies find application in two main areas, first, in the field of rapid diagnosis of virus disease in man, animals, and plants, and second, in the extension of virus taxonomy. These investigations could lead to more effective vaccination programs or disease treatment, and to a greater understanding of the relationships between viruses, their evolution, and epidemiology.",

Recently monoclonal antibodies have been developed which are directed against virus structural polypeptides Pereira et al., 1982~) . Some of these have proven able to detect CMV infection in biopsy specimens by the IF test . Antibodies specific for herpes simplex viruses types 1 and 2 (Balachandran et Pereira et al., 1982b; Showalter et al., 1981) have also been used to type these viruses directly in cells from herpetic lesions (Balachandran et al., 1982a; Peterson et al., 1983) . These tests yielded identical results to the more time consuming process of virus isolation and typing by restriction endonuclease mapping, and results were superior to those obtained by standard serology. A similar procedure has also proved successful in the identification of varicella zoster (human herpesvirus 3) in cells obtained from vesicular skin lesions (Forghani et al., 1982) ' and monoclonal antibodies are now available which could be useful for typing Epstein -Barr virus (human gamma herpesvirus 4) (Mueller-Lantzsch et al., 1981) . Herpes viruses can also be distinguished by a rapid enzyme immune filtration test (Richman et al., 1982) . Marek's disease (MD) virus is a herpes virus of chickens normally diagnosed by reference antisera directed against the Marek's associated tumor surface antigen (MATSA). Monoclonal antibodies have been obtained (Lee et al., 1983b) specific for MATSA, andused with success in the identification of Marek's disease in chickens (Lee et al., 1983a) . Use of this test should help prevent confusion with lymphoid leukosis, since both diseases produce similar symptoms and are of economic importance.",

In this manner the antibodies permit a fine analysis of intervirus relationships at both structural and biological levels. Monoclonal antibodies have been used to compare vaccine strains of yellow fever virus (YFV) derived in different laboratories. This confirmed the required similarity between vaccines in use and these strains could also be differentiated from virulent field isolates . A similar comparison of wild type polio virus andvaccine strains, Saukett and Sabin, has also been conducted (Crainic et al., 1981; Ferguson et al., 1982; Humphrey et al., 1982; Minor et al., 1982; Osterhaus et al., 1981a) . The use of monoclonal antibodies in the study of rabies infection has provided an important insight into the mechanism of virus pathogenicity (Section IV) and into the variation between virus strains. Many workers have compared field isolates using monoclonal antibodies directed against the virus glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein. In this way differences have been found between viruses previously considered identical Charlton et al., 1982; Digoutte, 1982; Schneider, 1982; Witkor and Koprowski, 1980; . This may have an important bearing on instances in which vaccine failure has been observed. Variation in the nucleocapsid protein is probably not so important in this respect (Charlton et al., 1982) . Such differences also exist between morbilliviruses (Giraudon and Wild, 1981a,b; Server et al., 1982; ter Meulen et aL, 1981) . In addition, monoclonal antibodies have permitted analysis of the similarities and differences between hapadnaviruses (C8te et al., 1982) , parvoviruses (Burtonboy et al., 1982; Parrish et al., 1982) , rotaviruses Gary et al., Greenberg et al., 1983) , bunyaviruses (Gonzalez-Scarano et al., 1982) and to identify Zinga virus as Rift Valley fever (Meegan et al., 1983) .",

            "text": "At the present time the virus best characterized with monoclonal antibodies is that of influenza. The three-dimensional structure has been determined for both the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) ; Section III,A,3). The maintenance of influenza within the human population is related to two mechanisms. First, exchange of the hemagglutinin gene with one derived from an animal virus accomplishes a complete antigenic change (antigenic shift) in the virus and permits widespread human infection. Preexisting immunity is thus overcome and a worldwide pandemic may result. In the periods between antigenic shift, a more gradual alteration occurs in the virus proteins (antigenic drift) which in some cases may permit reinfection of the host population. Monoclonal antibodies have naturally been applied to these most interesting phenomena in an attempt to demonstrate the relationships between human, animal, and avian virus species, and also to demonstrate antigenic drift both in the field and the laboratory. Monoclonal antibodies provide the sensitivity required to analyze subtle structural alterations and are therefore well suited to the task. The seal influenza virus A/seal/Massachusetts/l/80 (H7N7) has been compared with viruses of avian origin . A close relationship was noted between hemagglutinin molecules from those sources suggesting avian viruses might have played a role in the evolution of the seal virus strain. In other studies differences have been noted between 25 avian (H4) influenza strains which may be related to the original host (Fukushi et al., 1982) and differences have been observed between neuraminidase (NA) molecules (Holmes et al., 1982) . Antigenic drift has been demonstrated among field isolates of influenza A (Underwood, 1982) and B . In addition nonneutralized HA or NA variants are readily selected by using monoclonal antibodies to apply selection pressure (Natali et al., 1981; Webster et al., 1982) . This demonstrates how such a process might occur under immunological pressure applied by the host. At least some of these laboratory selected variants might have been able to spread in the population since they were not neutralized by many samples of sera from potential hosts which did recognize the parent virus (Natali et al., 1981) . In contrast to the ready demonstration of variability among the influenza viruses, tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBE) isolates have remained very similar over the last 26 years (Heinz et ab, 1982) .",

Immunofluorescence is the method of choice for this purpose since it is rapid and relatively simple. Furthermore, it is applicable directly to biopsy samples and provides additional information on the histological distribution of the antigen examined. However, binding alone is an insufficient guide for research purposes, since the functional significance of the same epitope may vary with the virus strain and mutations may render an antibody unable to inhibit protein function without abolishing antibody binding (Kendal et al., 1981) .

First, just as it is possible to identify proteins carrying a taxonomic marker, so it is possible to identify a protein as performing a particular function once an antibody is available which is capable of inhibiting that function. Second, antibodies binding to the same target protein differ in their capacity to produce function inhibition of that protein. A panel of monoclonal antibodies is frequently divided into groups according to their effects on the activity of a target protein, or family of proteins. In this way epitopes may be assigned a functional significance. If certain assumptions are made, it is then possible to conduct competitive binding analyses to arrange the antibody sites relative to each other, and a schematic map of the molecule's surface can be drawn up. Frequently virus variants can be selected to which a given antibody can no longer bind. These may also be analyzed for loss of protein function or loss of capacity to bind other monoclonal antibodies. In this way the map can be refined, or indeed constructed entirely. Third, in order to explain function in terms of structure it is necessary to orientate the map thus obtained with the physical structure of the antigen. This can be done by determination of the amino acid alterations produced in the variants described above, either directly by partial proteolysis and examination of those molecule fragments bound by the antibody, or from genome sequence determination in the region of the alteration. Active amino acid residues can thus be distinguished and positioned in the primary structure of the protein. The location of the antibody binding site is then known if the three-dimensional structure of the protein has been determined, or clues may be obtained from immune electron microscopy (IEM).",

The antibody used in this work was apparently capable of distinguishing between T antigen with this activity and T antigen which could not perform this function (Scheller et al., 1982) . A similar analysis has identified the cellular RNA polymerase which binds to the adenovirus 2 promotor in vitro (Dahmus and Kedinger, 1983) , and microinjection techniques have demonstrated that antibody specific to the transformation related protein p53 in 3T3 cells is capable of preventing the seruminduced onset of DNA synthesis (Mercer et al., 1982) . Although the last two experiments are concerned with the function of cellular proteins, this approach has an obvious application in the study of virus replication and transcription. Such an approach could also investigate the involvement of host -cell proteins in these processes. Further insight into the function of tumour virus proteins in transformed cell survival has come from work involving monoclonal antibodies specific for p15 E, a structural component of type C retroviruses.

In principle, the same approach could be extended to any protein with a measurable activity. Combination of antibody with antigen can have a variety of effects, de-pending on the site of attachment. Some functions which might previously have been thought associated, have been found separable when highly specific monoclonal antibodies were used. A polyclonal monospecific serum which coats the protein surface with antibody will normally inhibit all protein functions, but a monoclonal antibody, which binds away from the active site need not have any detectable effect at all (Burstin et al., 1982; Massey and Schochetman, 1981; Pinter et al., 1982; Thorpe et al., 1982) .",

Antibodies of group 4 revealed a significantly higher activity in the HI than the NT tests whereas this was reversed in group 5. The antibodies used in that study were deliberately selected from those which had undetectable HLI activities. This report therefore documents the separation of hemagglutination (a model for virus attachment to its target cell) from hemolysis (a model for virus penetration by fusion reactions). This indicates that the requirements underlying these reactions must differ. Both of these tests in fact are artificial, since the virus does not normally act to cross link cells, or to lyse the cell it is about to attack, and these results indicate that it is possible to prevent stable cell cross linking in circumstances which still permit sufficient virus/cell association for action of the fusion protein. Similarly, antibodies may inhibit hemagglutination but still permit sufficient cell contact such that infection is not inhibited (Burstin et al., 1982; Gentry et al., 1982; Gonzalez-Scarano et al., 1982; Kimura-Kiroda and Yasui, 1983; ter Meulen et al., 1981. This type of analysis provides clues that the functional areas of a multifunctional protein are distinct. For instance the paramyxovirus HN protein has two activities, cell attachment and neuraminidase. These probably reside at different areas of the molecule since some monoclonal antibodies inhibit only neuraminidase (Orvell and Grandien, 1982) , and virus variants have been obtained under monoclonal antibody selection pressure which are deficient only in neuraminidase (Portner, 1981) . In the same way, antibodies are known which neutralize virus without blocking hemagglutination. Presumably these antibodies bind to sites important in virus penetration but not absorption. This phenomenon is exemplified by Sendai virus (Miura et al., 1982) , influenza virus , Sindbis virus (Chanas et al., 1982a) , and reovirus (Burstin et al., 1982) . Other biological functions have been used to characterize epitopes defined by competition ELISA on the envelope glycoprotein of bovine leukemia virus (Bruck et al., 1982a) . This analysis concentrated on BLV/ VSV pseudotype formation inhibition, polykaryotosis inhibition (cell/cell fusion following infection), and complement fixation (Bruck et al., 1982b) .",

One monoclonal antibody carries the appropriate marker and unlabeled antibodies are assessed for their capacity to inhibit the combination of the labeled antibody with antigen. If competition is observed, the antibodies are said to belong to the same binding group. However, several precautions must be taken in the interpretation of data before meaningful conclusions can be reached. It is assumed that two antibodies are mutually competitive if their binding sites overlap. The binding site of a second antibody is then wholly or partially masked by the binding of the first antibody and binding is truly competitive in nature. However, this is not the only explanation for such an observation. Binding sites may be distinct but close together, such that the bulk of the first antibody molecule sterically prevents access of a second to its binding site. These two possibilities cannot be readily distinguished but do at least both imply proximity of attachment sites. In fact, a monoclonal antibody bound to a single epitope on its target protein may have considerable \"swivel\" movement available to it rendering steric effects relatively unimportant. Stone and Nowinski (1980) reported that two IgG molecules (MW 150K) could bind noncompetitively to a retrovirus 15K protein. However, immunoglobulin class may well be important here since oligomeric IgM would obviously provide a greater steric hindrance than IgG. If steric effects are suspected they may be minimized by the use of monomeric antigen-binding submolecular antibody fragments.",

            "text": "Finally, two antibodies directed at the same site will compete in a manner related to their relative avidities or concentrations. Taking an extreme case, a weakly binding antibody would not show detectable competition with a labeled, strongly binding immunoglobulin, but the reverse is clearly not true. In practice a spectrum of relative interference efficiencies will probably be obtained (Lefrancois and Lyles, 1982a,b; Stone and Nowinski, 1980) . The extent of interference obtained will be influenced by the antibody avidity as well as the proximity of the binding sites. For this reason binding sites should not be distinguished on the basis of the extent of competition, it is the observation of competition itself which is significant. Furthermore, while the observation of competition assigns two antibodies to the same binding group, it is not sufficient to separate them merely on the basis of failure to compete. Any such noncompeting antibodies should be examined in the reverse experiment (i.e., with the other partner carrying the marker) to exclude avidity effects as described above. If this procedure fails to reveal competition, then allocation to separate binding groups is justified. Alternatively, determination of antibody avidity may obviate the need for this analysis but one-way competition effects can still occur even in the case of antibodies of similar avidity and concentration (Carter et al., 1982) . The reasons for this are unknown but might involve some form of allosteric effect. Determination of antibody avidity may be performed by a rapid method (Jackson et al., 1983) or relative antibody avidities may be estimated from RIA saturation curves (Carter et al., 1982; Massey and Schochetman, 1981; Stone and Nowinski, 1980) . The competitive binding procedure has been applied with success to many viruses. Monoclonal antibodies specific for the measles virus hemagglutinin were grouped into five sets on the basis of their ability to influence the biological functions of that molecule and these were then sorted into three binding groups by competition radioimmunoassay (Carter et ul., 1982) . A similar approach has produced a detailed map of the VSV G protein including epitopes instrumental in virus neutralization in which determinants were identified as cross-reacting or specific to the strains Indiana or New Jersey (Lefrancois and Lyles, 1982a,b; Volk et al., 1982) . Japanese encephalitis virus (Kimura-Kiroda and Yasui, 1983) and RNA tumor viruses (Bruck et al., 1982a,b; Massey and Schochetman, 1981; Niman and Elder, 1982; Pinter et al., 1982) have also been extensively analyzed. The binding group analysis forms a sensitive probe for alterations in protein surface structure . The manner in which the sample is prepared can also influence the conformation and/or exposure of the reacting epitopes and this should be considered in the design of such experiments (Bruck et al., 1982b) .",

            "text": "The second approach to the problem of arranging binding sites relative to each other is to select virus variants under monoclonal antibody selection pressure. In the case of neutralizing antibodies this is relatively straightforward. Nonneutralizing antibodies could also be applied to enveloped viruses if used in conjunction with complement. Virus variants may then be isolated to which the selecting antibodies can no longer bind, or in which antibody combination no longer results in neutralization. These viruses are then tested with a panel of monoclonal antibodies to determine which other antibodies also show altered binding characteristics. In this way, a map of epitopes can be constructed . The virus variants are commonly already present in the population at a frequency of (Emini et al., 1982; Portner et aL, 1980; Prabhakar et al., 1982; Webster et al., 1982) which presumably represents the error rate in virus transcription. This results in amino acid substitutions either within the antibody binding site or at a position which influences the structure of the binding site. This type of experiment provides a finer analysis of the relationships between binding sites because steric hindrance is eliminated. Variant selection and mapping has been applied in the main to the HA and NA proteins of influenza. The extremely detailed studies performed by Laver et al., (1979 Laver et al., ( ,1980a and Gerhard et al., (1981) exemplify this approach. However, regardless of the method in which epitope topography is determined, the schematic map thus produced must be oriented on the physical structure of the protein and this necessitates a detailed knowledge of the molecule.",

Products of partial proteolysis were identified by reactivity with antisera directed against synthetic polypeptides predicted from the gene sequence. The other polypeptides were assigned by peptide map-ping. In this way a linear proteolytic leavage map could be derived for 8 different enzymes. Monoclonal antibodies were then analyzed for their ability to immunoprecipitate various polypeptide fragments and their binding sites could then be assigned in the molecule's primary structure.",

Studies using several monoclonal antibodies failed to detect M protein in persistently infected tissue culture cell lines (SSPE cell lines) derived from SSPE patient brain (Carter et al., 1984) . Although this method did permit identification of M protein in a laboratory-established persistent infection which was previously thought not to express this polypeptide . Monoclonal antibodies thus provide excellent evidence that matrix protein is not synthesized in SSPE cell lines. The lack of this major structural polypeptide is thought to prevent virus particle maturation and account for the slowly progressing nature of the disease. Measles virus persistently infected cells show a low expression of membrane glycoproteins (Norrby et al., 1982) ' although expression is normally sufficient to permit development of syncytia. The expression of virus polypeptides has also been investigated within mouse brain persistently infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus (Oldstone and Buchmeier, 1982; Rodriguez et al., 1983) , Sendai virus , and on the surface of spleen cells from mice infected with Friend leukemia virus (Britt et al., 1981) .

However, monoclonal antibodies have been used in pulse-chase experiments to demonstrate genuine modification of proteins through glycosylation (Balachandran et al., 1981) and also to demonstrate temporal regulation of their synthesis (Showalter et al., 1981) . Misra et al., (1982) have studied the maturation of an HSV-1 early glycoprotein (GVP-11). These workers discovered that tunicamycin-sensitive glycosylation was necessary for the cell surface expression of this protein. However, monoclonal antibodies may not react with the unmodified form of a protein (only one antibody from a panel of 65 directed against measles virus H protein reacted with the unmodified product formed in vitro; M. J. Carter, unpublished observation) and consequently might not always provide an adequate probe for the expression of the polypeptide moiety. A polyclonal serum should therefore always be used. Opposite results have been obtained with measles virus H protein. Glycosylation was not required for insertion into the rough endoplasmic reticulum and intracellular transport of the protein to the plasma membrane. This detailed study also elucidated intermediates formed in the protein modification pathway leading to the mature molecule (Bellini et al., 1983) .",

In the latter case it was also shown that the irreversible conversion of N to H could be accomplished by some acidic isolation procedures . This explained an earlier finding that some capsids were in the H form inside the infected cell (Ferguson et al., 1981) . More biologically relevant information concerning virus assembly has also been derived from studies of poliovirus. Two monoclonal antibodies were obtained which bound to poliovirion precursor structures. The sites recognized were different, one antibody bound to infectious virions, 80 S empty capsids in the N form and to 14 S precursor subunits, the other bound only to virions and empty capsids. Neither antibody bound to the heat-treated particles. Furthermore, the antibody binding sites were both shown to be located on VP1 by chemical cross linking, but neither antibody bound well to free VP1 in the native or denatured form. This indicated the sites recognized were formed only in the capsid structure. However, variants could readily be selected which did not express these sites, so it is likely that the areas recognized by these antibodies are not vital for structural integrity (Emini et al., 1982) . Similar data have been reported for foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) where monoclonal antibodies have been obtained which can distinguish between complete (146s) virions and their precursor (12 S) subunits (McCullogh and Butcher, 1982) . These two studies demonstrate that unique antigenic sites are created during picornavirus maturation and explain earlier reports that neutralizing antibodies could only be elicited by using the mature polio virion as immunogen (Dernick, 1981) . A similar effect has been demonstrated in the case of TMV where some monoclonal antibodies react only with the nucleocapsid, and others only with the protein monomer (Dietzgen and Sander, 1982) . Although the former class must recognize a new site caused by conformational change or formed at molecular junctions, the latter class of antibodies could be directed at a site which is either masked in the protein complex or destroyed through conformational change.",

For instance gp 56 and gp 50 have been shown closely associated on the Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus envelope by means of competitive binding studies (Roehrig et al., 1982a) . A similar examination showed that the influenza hemagglutinin was close to the cellular H-2K histocompatibility antigen on the surface of the infected cell. A complex is not apparently formed since these antigens did not cocap (Hackett and Askonas, 1982) . On the mature influenza virus envelope however, the HA protein is often found in close association with the NA protein, since monoclonal antibodies specific for hemagglutinin may have a neuraminidase inhibiting activity . Frequently, virus-specific products associate with cellular proteins and this can be demonstrated by competitive binding assays or coprecipitation experiments (Carroll and Gurney, 1982; Ferracini et al., 1982; Sarnow et al., 1982) . c. Mutations. Structural change can also result from the acquisition of mutations by the virus genome. During persistent infection a virus genome is able to accumulate mutations rapidly (Holland et al., 1979) . The resulting structural alterations in virus proteins can be detected by monoclonal antibodies. Differences have been found in the glycoproteins synthesized by lytic transforming EBV and by the nontransforming virus shed from persistent infections . Such changes have also been demonstrated in the measles virus hemagglutinin by immunofluorescence . A similar process has been detected by alterations in competitive binding behavior using monoclonal antibodies specific for the measles virus matrix protein . In this study an apparent separation of binding groups was observed. A monoclonal antibody was found to have lost its capacity to compete with a second even though both still immunoprecipitated the M protein. This example illustrates that the detection of structural change is dependent on the method used. An examination based solely on radioimmune precipitation may be superior in detecting certain changes which \"loosen\" the protein and render it more susceptible to the action of detergents in the buffer used. However, changes in relative avidity, topography, or allostery would not be detected provided antibody avidity was still sufficiently high to permit precipitation (Section I). Similarly, detergent produced effects might not be detected in the competition RIA alone.",

Similar experiments led Dietzschold et al., (1983) to the identification of a single amino acid change in nonpathogenic variants of rabies virus. The arginine residue present in the virulent virus glycoprotein at position 333 was substituted in all avirulent variants tested. Such differences have been identified (Section I1,B) at other positions in the virus proteins. Broadly similar results have also been obtained in studies of reovirus. Monoclonal antibodies which neutralized the virus (Burstin et al., 1982) were used in the selection of variants.

            "text": "The host immune response has been implicated in the maintenance of measles virus persistence leading to SSPE. As described in Section JII,B, the disease is associated with a defect in the production of virus M protein. Some evidence has been gathered that suggests the hosts' immune response itself may actually modulate the synthesis of virus polypeptides and consequently help to bring this situation about (Fujinami and Oldstone, 1979 ). This has been modelled in uiuo where inoculation of a hyperimmune anti-measles virus antiserum was found to alter the characteristics of disease in intracerebrally inoculated BALB/c mice, a delayed disease was then produced. Inoculation of monoclonal antibody specific for the virus hemagglutinin protein was also able to induce this effect although monoclonal antibody directed against the nucleocapsid protein could not (Rammohan et al., 1981) . A similar process has been demonstrated with a measles virus persistent infection in uitto. Antiserum treatment of C6 cells persistently infected with measles virus led to a drastic reduction in the expression of virus polypeptides (Barrett and Koschel, 1983) . Once again monoclonal antibody to H, but not N could produce this effect (P. N. Barrett, personal communication) . Antibody to surface glycoprotein can also prolong experimental Sindbis virus infection (Chanas et al., 1982a) . Antibodies with neutralizing activity were active in this respect while those which lacked this property were not. This is also reflected in the measles virus system described above. Monoclonal antibodies which neutralized the virus seemed to be exclusively active in producing the alteration in virus polypeptide expression (P. N. Barrett, personal communication) . However, it is also true that under some circumstances monoclonal antibodies can enhance virus infection. Flaviviruses, in combination with antibody, are able to infect cells bearing Fc receptors through a cross bridging mediated by the antibody (Chanas et al., 1982b; Peiris et al., 1982; Schlesinger et al., 1983) . However, use of monoclonal antibodies has demonstrated that the virus epitope to which the antibody is bound is also important. Brandt et al. (1982) found only flavivirus type common determinants were effective, and second, that some cells were unable to support YFV replication even when antibody enhancement was attempted. Consequently the presence of the Fc receptor on the target cell surface is not alone sufficient for productive infection.",

            "text": "Use of monoclonal antibodies for therapeutic purposes is as yet in its infancy. It is likely that the antibodies would be used in three main areas. First, in emergency, injection of a neutralizing antibody can aid recovery from disease. Human monoclonal antibodies are now becoming available (Crawford et al., 1983; Sikora and Neville, 1982) and are likely to produce fewer problems with allergic reaction. Animal experiments in the mouse have indicated that monoclonal antibodies will be beneficial in this area. Neutralizing antibodies are able to localize HSV infection and prevent spread to the nervous system (Kapoor et al., 1982) , promote recovery from ocular infection (Rector et al., 1982) or protect against a later footpad challenge (Dix et al., 1981) , and antibodies to any herpesvirus glycoprotein had protective activity. Intravenous inoculation of monoclonal antibody specific for the virus hemagglutinin was found to protect mice from the invariably lethal consequences of intracerebral injection with influenza WSN. This action was however dependent upon the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (Doherty and Gerhard, 1981) . The ability of antibody to function in this way is not simply correlated with its anti-virus action measured by in uitro assays. Nonneutralizing antibodies protect mice from HSV (Balachandran et al., 1982c; Rector et al., 1982) or Sindbis virus (Schmaljohn et al., 1982) , and Mathews and Roehrig (1982) found nonneutralizing antibodies could also protect mice from Japanese equine encephalitis infection. Antibodies of high avidity protected with greater efficiency than those of lower avidity, but antibodies directed against epitopes instrumental in neutralizing the virus were effective at lower doses. This work therefore implicates the tightness of attachment as well as site of combination with antigen in efficiency of protection.",

Heterogeneity among Coxsackie (Prabhakar et al., 1982) or bluetongue viruses ) may permit such an approach. The antibodies could also be used in the preparation of pure subunit vaccines (Osterhaus et al., 1981b) . Finally, when combined with a cytotoxic agent, monoclonal antibodies provide a specific cell killing tool (Davies, 1981) .

            "text": "In the foregoing discussion it has been emphasized how the specificity of a monoclonal antibody can be applied to the study of all areas of virology. In each case it is the specificity of the antibody which has proved useful, and even permitted the identification of related but hitherto unknown proteins. However, this very specificity also provides the basis for spurious cross reactivity not normally present in polyclonal serum. In general, an appropriately absorbed monospecific antiserum will recognize many epitopes and thus coat a considerable area of a protein's exposed surface. A single epitope repeated on another protein would cross react, but this would be masked by the vast majority of antibodies reacting with the target antigen. In the case of a monoclonal antibody this is not so. A target molecule may have only one site for the antibody and if this is shared with another protein a considerable cross reaction could be detected, even in the abscence of extensive structural homology. It has been calculated (Crawford et al., 1982 ) that a primary sequence of four amino acids (a not unusual size for an antibody binding site) might occur some 15 times in the average cell's complement of protein sequences. However, monoclonal antibody cross reactions would be expected much less frequently than this because (1) the amino acid sequence must be expressed on the surface of the molecule, (2) antibodies may recognize a sequence in a given conformation or state of modification, (3) protein sequence does not normally occur at random, and (4) antibody binding sites are often larger than this (Atassi, 1975) .",

However, this could perhaps be tolerated as a small constituent of a total non-self-cross-reacting immune response. Consequently, it is likely that fortuitous cross reaction may be comparatively rare. Nevertheless, many cross reactions have been reported which are at present not understood (reviewed by Lane and Koprowski, 1982) . Several of these (Crawfordet al., 1982; Lane and Hoeffler, 1980) involve cross rections between SV40 T antigen and host proteins or between SV40 T and t antigens (Harlow et al., 1981) . In the former case there is good reason to believe that some of these antibodies recognize epitopes on functionally related host proteins, and which therefore may be constrained to some degree of overall structural similarity. Whether this represents an evolutionarily conserved structure, or one which has arisen by independent convergent evolutionary processes is unknown. However, cross reaction at the monoclonal antibody level cannot be assumed indicative of any extensive structural or functional similarity without considerable supporting evidence.",
