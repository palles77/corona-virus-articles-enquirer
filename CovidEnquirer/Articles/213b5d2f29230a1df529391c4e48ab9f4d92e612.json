There are many factors that go into recovery, for example, the physical reconstruction of homes and public buildings, transportation, and basic services infrastructure, as well as psychological mending of the community and economic recovery of lost time and resources. This stage cannot be considered in isolation because mitigation, the fourth phase, must be integrated into recovery for it to be sustainable.",

            "text": "In 1977, Haas et al 3 became the first group to identify and describe the recovery process. They listed recovery as a sequential four-stage model of emergency, restoration, replacement, and development. Current models describe a more fluid recovery process with these stages overlapping and potentially occurring simultaneously. 4 For example, replacement reconstruction may occur in some locations while at the same time debris clearance occurs elsewhere. Recovery currently focuses on the idea of sustainable development, 4 a concept created by a United Nations Commission in 1986, which refers to recovery as a way to improve the quality of lives and durability of communities. 5 This has been defined in the World Commission on Environment and Development as \"meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\" 6 In the short run, it may cost more; better materials may be used, houses and businesses may be relocated, and more stringent building codes and zones laws may be implemented. In the long run, its goal is to protect and strengthen key social and economic infrastructure before disasters strike so as to reduce the likelihood of loss of life and assets 7 and ultimately improve the community and save money. 5 There is a vast spectrum of disasters, and the process of disaster recovery can adapt the available tools to fit the specific situation. It is useful to apply a framework in thinking about the similarities and differences in disasters. They can be categorized as natural or manmade, sudden onset or slow onset. Examples of natural disasters that are slow onset are droughts or epidemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); sudden onset examples are floods, hurricanes, and earthquakes. Examples of manmade disasters that are slow onset are wars such as the war in Iraq, and sudden onset examples are bombings or terrorist activities such as the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and the Exxon Valdez oil tanker spill in 1989. In general, the important differences are the duration of the impact and the severity of direct and indirect effects. Direct effects are defined as the physical destruction and lives lost as a result of the disaster. Indirect effects are the work time lost, jobs lost, and the change in spending in the community involved.",

Over a period of months, 300,000 refugees were rehoused and 500,000 permanently evacuated. Adequate water supply was a problem even though wells had been dug prior to the event. Yet within 5 months, Hamburg had recovered up to 80% of its former productivity. 8 In 1945, the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. Deaths were estimated at 80,000, and almost 70% of buildings were destroyed. In this case, recovery took much longer. It was only by 1949, 4 years later, that the population had recovered to its former numbers and 70% of the destroyed buildings had been reconstructed. 8 In 1982, Marin County experienced continued floods and mudslides until finally a presidential disaster was declared. Federal teams had trouble appropriately identifying local public priorities from the myriad of recovery issues. As an example, the Intelligence Hazard Mitigation Team identified two sites for priority attention. County officials indicated that those were not the priorities they would have selected. 1 Damage survey reports were begun in over 300 sites, and many were held up by disagreements over the definition of a mudslide versus a landslide and how to define repair versus permanent restoration. Each of these occurrences receive different levels of funding. 1 On the positive side, Marin County actively included mitigation into recovery efforts. They created landslide-protection zones and required that prospective home buyers receive mandatory notification of stability problems. 1 In 1988, Jamaica was hit with Hurricane Gilbert. This was the first direct hit with a hurricane in more than 35 years. As a result, Jamaica had been in a period of complacency with a low sense of preparedness and concern for mitigation. Nineteen of the 33 watershed areas had been eroded by deforestation and the expansion of agriculture onto high-slope areas. When Hurricane Gilbert struck, there occurred not only the destruction from the hurricane but also subsequent significant flooding and landslides. Many Jamaicans lived in highly vulnerable locations. The low-income housing in the area that was not built up to the housing codes,and those in floodplains and gullies suffered predominantly. 9 It was estimated that 20% of all housing was damaged and 2% destroyed. 9 In 1989 when the Loma Prieta earthquake hit Santa Cruz County, the local community was strong. When the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) came and set up a disaster assistance center (DAC) in the city of Santa Cruz, the citizen leaders requested a satellite DAC to support the rural population. FEMA accepted the request after determining that a significant number of families had been overlooked in their initial assessment. By working together,the community and the federal government were able to adequately support the victims of this disaster. 2",

The local government asked Congress for help, creating the first legislative act for federal resources. In 1950 the first permanent and general legislation, the Federal Disaster Act, came into existence. This was revolutionary because it was the first Act to create a general response to all disasters. Before this, each disaster resulted in Congress passing a new localized piece of legislation. In 1979, President Carter pulled all the distinct response groups together along with the military resources to create FEMA.",

The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 established specific requirements for hazard mitigation planning, and grants became available to allow local and state governments to use mitigation funds for predisaster planning. 6 In 2001 the actions of Sept. 11 pushed Congress to create the Department of Homeland Security, which was the largest reorganization of federal agencies since the Great Depression. 6 The magnitude of disaster recovery depends on the magnitude of the destruction. In a small local disaster, volunteer organizations such as the Red Cross and private insurers may be enough to aid victims. When a disaster overwhelms the recovery forces of a community, that community can turn to the state government, and ultimately to FEMA, for resources. Within the first 48 hours of a disaster, an assessment team should provide an initial assessment of the damage. This includes identifying immediate needs such as food, shelter, and infrastructure. A preliminary damage assessment by the local government will determine whether federal aid may be needed and should be requested. Once the immediate needs are identified, and if federal aid is requested, a second, more in-depth survey should be done by FEMA. This second survey should include asking the plans of the displaced citizens: Do they plan to move, or rebuild in the same spot? Public infrastructure, sewers, and storm drains should be examined. What about the town? What was there before the disaster? What currently exists? Were there any existing plans for expansion of the area that could be used for rebuilding? What are opportunities looking at the long term? 10 Every U.S. state maintains an Emergency Management Agency (EMA) and an Emergency Operations Plan. Their role is to establish and maintain an emergency program concerned with preparedness, response, mitigation, and recovery; to coordinate and train state and local governments; to recommend whether federal aid is needed in the case of a disaster; and to coordinate state and federal resources and act as an intermediary between local and federal groups. 6 In the past, the majority of these plans have been concerned primarily with the short-term response. 2 Recently many states have been trying to adapt to a more long-term response.",

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. 11 In 2000 there were 45 major disaster declarations made in 31 states and the District of Columbia. 12 These disasters ranged from tornadoes to wildfires to winter storms. Initial response resources include food, water, emergency generators, and the mobilization of specialized teams (e.g., search and rescue, medical assistance, damage assessment, and communications). For more long-term relief, there are loans and grants to repair or replace housing and personal property, roads, and public buildings. There is also assistance for mitigation opportunities, counseling, and legal services. These services are outlined in the Federal Response Plan (FRP), which describes the policies and plans of 25 federal departments and the U.S. Red Cross. 11 The FRP can be implemented in conjunction with other specialized groups including plans for telecommunications support, the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan, the Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan, and the Terrorism Incident Annex. 11 In addition to the FRP, some federal agencies have the authority to provide disaster aid even when the magnitude is not sufficient for the president to declare a federal disaster, including the Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce, Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Small Business Association (SBA). The FRP employs a multiagency operations structure based on the Incident Command System (ICS). (See Chapter 30, The Incident Command System.)

These grants are for basic needs only, not to return life to normal. Costs can include medical and counseling assistance, housing repair, funeral expenses, and insurance premiums. 2. Public assistance:This program gives aid to local governments for emergency services and the repair or replacement of public facilities, for example, the removal of debris, repair of infrastructure, or emergency protective measures. It is often the most costly element of recovery, and typically the cost is shared with the state in a 75%/25% split. 6 3. Hazard mitigation grant program 10 : These grants are used by the federal, state, and local governments to incorporate mitigation into the recovery process. Actions may include acquisition of homes, public education, and retrofitting structures to better resist subsequent disasters such as floods and hurricanes. Cost will be shared between federal and state resources. 6 Businesses have special considerations in light of a disaster. The primary objective of recovery planning is to enable an organization to survive a disaster and to continue normal business operations. To survive, the organization must ensure that critical operations can resume/continue normal processing and minimize the duration of a serious disruption to operations and resources (both information processing and other resources); a premade contingency plan is the best method of accomplishing this. 13 Specific measures may include having an alternate site of operations if the current facility is damaged, storing vital documents off-site, and having an alternative energy source such as a generator. Larger businesses may be better able to withstand a disaster because assets and the workforce may be dispersed across a wider geographical area. 6 A disaster is a life-altering event. Survivors share an enormous experience and come to view the world around them in new and different ways. Seeking help from the government, voluntary agencies, and insurance companies can be long and frustrating, which may only compound the feelings of helplessness. Anger and further despair are common. Mental health staff may assist persons by reassuring them that this \"second disaster\" is a common phenomenon 14 and that they are not alone in their frustration. Many people may not want to seek formal counseling, either because of the stigma some still associate with psychiatric help or because they are unwilling to take time away from putting their lives back together or helping others. Very effective mental health assistance can be provided while the worker is helping survivors with concrete tasks. The \"over a cup of coffee\" method of informal intervention may be the best method to help. For example, a mental health worker can use skilled but unobtrusive interviewing techniques to help a survivor sort out demands and set priorities while they are jointly sifting through disaster rubble. 14 Although having community involvement is beneficial to the process of recovery, it is also very important for the mental well-being of the community. Failing to involve the community can lead to resentment and fragmentation. The inhabitants may be unhappy when aid is not appropriate to the community's perceived needs, and this insult may be compounded if they are then labeled unappreciative of the federal help. When people have a hand in their own recovery, they feel empowered and will increase their involvement. This leads to a stronger community network that in turn increases the ability to provide self-help.",

Ninety-eight percent of all homes were affected, 50% severely and 20% completely destroyed. 9 The Peace Corps brought in large numbers of prefabricated housing to replace all the destroyed homes. Although they were able to help a lot of people numerically, the homes they provided had two-sided pitched roofs instead of the typical Caribbean four-sided roofs that were better able to withstand tropical winds. They also did not have an interior design to allow for cross ventilation. The early recipients of the homes reported this finding to the Peace Corps, but the Peace Corps was unable to change the design. Though well intentioned, the Peace Corps was predominantly meeting the need projected by the donors instead of the actual needs of the victims. 9 Overdependence on vertical planning can also result in a lack of accountability and thus uneven recovery results. In Jamaica, after Hurricane Gilbert, the primary housing aid program was the Building Stamp Programme, which was set up by the Jamaican government, the World Bank, Canada, Germany, Japan, OPEC, and the United States. Homeowners were issued building stamps based on the extent of damages and financial need. These stamps would then be redeemed only at building supply stores who were members of the Jamaican Hardware Merchants Association for building materials, including zinc sheets, nails, and lumber. Squatters and renters were not eligible for stamps and were left without any recourse for finding aid. People who were not at home during the time of the survey were not listed as needing aid. 9 Additionally, it was found that the stamps were distributed unequally. As a result, many needy people were left without any support.",

            "text": "There is always the risk of creating a \"dependency syndrome\" by not thinking of sustainable development when investing money and effort into the recovery process. 9 This occurs by the replacement of homes and infrastructure that are likely to be destroyed by subsequent disasters or that do not benefit the town, resulting in the need for continued care for each disaster. Instead of being able to learn from prior occurrences and create a more resilient town/infrastructure, the same mistakes are repeated over and over again. For example, Jamaicans used the stamps to fulfill daily needs such as mattresses and utensils and did not spend time reinforcing their homes against further hurricanes or floods. When the next hurricane hits, these people will have the same destruction to their homes as occurred with Hurricane Gilbert. 9 In the case of too little horizontal planning, the results may be a chaotic lack of cooperation between groups and potential leaders. Studies have shown that many community plans focus primarily on the emergency period and do not give adequate attention to recovery and reconstruction. If there is a plan, it often exists on paper only and in the case of an actual disaster it is not used. In fact, many officials are not aware that a plan exists. 4 These flaws lead to chaotic implementation of an ad hoc recovery. The community lacks the ability to work together and thus fragments and cannot unify to control its own affairs. As a result, the redevelopment is likely to be inadequate to fulfill the needs of the community. If there is aid from government and nongovernmental groups, they are sometimes uncoordinated, either duplicating actions, leaving areas without any aid, 4 or giving aid that is inadequate for the needs of the area. In Saragossa, Texas, a small isolated community that was devastated by a tornado in 1987, there was no local government in place at all. When a disaster advisory board was created, it was done without any input from the local inhabitants. The outcome was that the Saragossans considered themselves worse off 2 years after the tornado than they had been beforehand, both because of the quality of the rebuilt neighborhoods and because they felt they were looked on as helpless and ungrateful. 2 Studies in the Caribbean have shown that the different power levels in an uncoordinated community may lead to powerful interest groups pressuring public authorities to rebuild first in areas in which they have the greatest interest. Poorer neighbors with weaker ties to public authorities will get delayed care. 2 In the United States, vertical planning predominates because few communities have detailed plans in place and because they may not have the financial reserve to pay for the recovery. When a plan is in place before a disaster, it allows for a strong horizontal network. Then, when a useful vertical element is added, the results can work wonders. By 1975 recurrent floods had repeatedly decimated the town of Soldiers Grove, Wisconsin. Each time they rebuilt. At one point they added a dam, and they planned for a levee but were unable because of financial restrictions. They decided they would take the funds allocated for the levee and use it to plan for town relocation. Although federal funds were slow in coming, they did create a plan. In 1978, when the largest flood in the history of the area occurred, they were ready with a fully written strategy. When they were granted funds for reconstruction, they put their plan into effect. Not only did they relocate out of the flood plain to prevent reoccurrence of this destruction, but they decided to create a town that was 75% solar powered. 5 Because they had had the luxury of time in the planning stage, they had asked each business owner where they wanted to be located and how they wanted their business to be built.",
