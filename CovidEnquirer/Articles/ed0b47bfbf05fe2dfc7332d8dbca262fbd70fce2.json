In India, although many encephalitis outbreaks have been associated with Japanese encephalitis virus, 1 several outbreaks have remained undiagnosed. One such outbreak was documented in Jamshedpur as early as 1954. 2 A group of patients was characterised by sudden onset of high-grade fever (101-106\u00b0F), occasional vomiting, rigors, and drowsiness leading to unconsciousness, followed by death in 6-48 h. The age of the affected children ranged from 2\u00b75 months to 15 years. The case fatality rate was 52\u00b73%, and CSF findings were within normal limits. The cause was thought to be viral, but laboratory findings were inconclusive. Subsequently, outbreaks of a similar nature were described from Nagpur, Raipur, Bilaspur, and nearby areas of central India in the years 1958, 1965, 1968, 1978, and 1983 . Similar outbreaks were reported from Warangal in Andhra Pradesh in 1997 and 2002. In the absence of a defined cause, these outbreaks were tentatively attributed to Reye's syndrome, dengue, chikungunya, Japanese encephalitis, measles, and so on. [3] [4] [5] An outbreak of encephalitis was reported between June and September, 2003, in Andhra Pradesh and adjoining areas in the Maharashtra state of India. We report our investigation into the cause of this outbreak.",

A smaller proportion (four of 30 [13%]) of serum samples obtained up to 4 days after onset of illness (early samples) were positive for IgM reactive with Chandipura virus, compared with samples obtained later than 4 days after onset of illness (11 of 16 [69%]; p<0\u00b7001).

Analysis of partial G gene sequences showed that the genome of the Chandipura virus strain associated with this outbreak was distinct from that of the reference strain obtained in 1965. Importantly, in one fatal encephalitis case from this outbreak, both Chandipura viral antigen and RNA were detected in situ in the post-mortem brain tissue. The clinical presentation of this patient was representative of the symptoms seen in most of the other patients reported during the present outbreak. Chandipura virus was also subsequently isolated from this tissue. Therefore, the presence of the virus in the brain was probably the cause of CNS pathology leading to encephalitis in this patient. Moreover, the presence of Chandipura virus RNA in nine patients with encephalitis, all from samples obtained before day 4 after onset of illness, suggests an early viraemic phase of the infection process. That five of six virus isolates were obtained from such early samples further strengthens this observation.",

The absence of evidence of such an infection in some samples could be because samples were obtained very soon after disease onset. A small proportion of the remaining cases might represent encephalitis due to The presence of IgM reactive with Chandipura virus in two patients with fever and in two family contacts of a patient with encephalitis suggests that infection with the virus may remain asymptomatic or lead to fever without encephalitis; the disease spectrum needs careful study. Evidence of IgG against Chandipura virus detected in adults probably indicates environmental exposure to the virus. Several earlier outbreaks of encephalitis recorded in central India from 1954 onwards that showed similarities to the present outbreak (clinical features, seasonality, and undetermined aetiology) might perhaps have been due to Chandipura virus, which could be endemic in these regions.",

In India, these insects are more prevalent in the early monsoon period, a season that coincided with the present outbreak.
