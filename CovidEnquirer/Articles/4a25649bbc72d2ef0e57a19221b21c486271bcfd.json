Knowledge on the ecology of reservoir-borne viruses is critical for preventive approaches against zoonotic epidemics. We studied a maternity colony of Myotis myotis bats in the attic of a private house in a suburban neighborhood in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, during 2008, 2009, and 2010. One coronavirus, 6 astroviruses, and 1 novel adenovirus were identifi ed and monitored quantitatively. Strong and specifi c amplifi cation of RNA viruses, but not of DNA viruses, occurred during colony formation and after parturition. The breeding success of the colony was signifi cantly better in 2010 than in 2008, in spite of stronger amplifi cation of coronaviruses and astroviruses in 2010, suggesting that these viruses had little pathogenic infl uence on bats. However, the general correlation of virus and bat population dynamics suggests that bats control infections similar to other mammals and that they may well experience epidemics of viruses under certain circumstances.",

Their ability to fl y and migrate, as well as the large sizes of social groups, predispose them for the acquisition and maintenance of viruses (2) . Although the ways of contact are unknown, bat-borne viruses can be passed to other mammals and cause epidemics (2, 3) . Several seminal studies have recently implicated bats as sources of important RNA viruses of humans and livestock, including lyssaviruses, coronaviruses (CoVs), fi loviruses, henipaviruses, and astroviruses (AstVs) (2, 4) . DNA viruses, including herpesviruses and adenoviruses (AdVs), have also been detected in bats, although with less clear implications regarding the role of bats as sources of infection for other mammals (5) (6) (7) (8) . While most of the above-mentioned viruses are carried by tropical fruit bats (Megachiroptera), the predominant hosts of mammalian CoVs, including those related to the agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), are insectivorous bats (Microchiroptera) that are not restricted to tropical climates (1) . By demonstrating the presence of SARS-related CoV in Europe, we have recently shown that the geographic extent of its reservoir is much larger than that of other bat-borne viruses, including Ebola, Marburg, Nipah, and Hendra (9) .",

We do not know how viruses with human pathogenic potential are maintained in bat populations, whether and how they are amplifi ed and controlled, and whether they cause effects on individual bats or on bat populations. The current lack of data is due to diffi culties in monitoring virus populations (rather than bat populations) in suffi cient density. Available studies have focused on lyssaviruses, hennipaviruses, and fi loviruses, which have extremely low detection frequencies, thus causing viruses to be encountered too rarely to enable the characterization of virus frequency and concentration over time (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . These studies have therefore relied on antibody testing, which provides higher detection rates by making indirect and cumulative assessments of virus contact during the lifetime of bats (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . However, results of antibody testing fail to correlate with the current presence of virus, preventing reliable analysis of a time component.",

Taking these clues together, we speculated that maternity roosts, inhabited predominantly by lactating females and newborns, with few adult males (17) , might serve as the compartment of CoV amplifi cation within the yearly life-cycle of bats in temperate climates. We therefore investigated the patterns of maintenance and amplifi cation of specifi c RNA-and DNA viruses by direct and quantitative virus detection in a maternity colony over 3 consecutive years. RNA-and DNA viruses were examined because of their different abilities to persist and to rapidly generate new variants. Viruses identifi ed included 1 CoV, 6 different AstVs, as well as a novel bat AdV. To assess the pathogenic infl uence of these viruses on bats, we quantifi ed the reproductive success of the colony over the same time period.",

For instance, increased contact between bats and humans through bat migratory events or fruit harvesting periods have been temporally linked with individual human cases of Ebola and Nipah virus infection (22, 23) . One study has shown Empty columns indicate pools that tested negative. In panel B, light and dark gray bars identify results by 2 different real-time RT-PCRs that were used simultaneously to cover the large astrovirus diversity encountered.",

            "text": "that the success of Nipah virus isolation from Pteropus spp. bats depended on seasonal factors, which was interpreted as evidence for season-dependent variation of virus concentration or prevalence (24) . Furthermore, the reproductive cycle of bats has been tentatively connected with seasonality of henipavirus, fi lovirus and lyssavirus seropositivity in bats as well as with the temporal distribution of Nipah virus outbreaks in humans (10,12,,15, 25-27) . Our direct data on virus concentration and prevalence for CoV and AstV integrate many of these independent observations and provide a model that might be transferable to other viruses. The initial peak in annual CoV and AstV prevalence observed in our study was probably due to the formation of a contiguous population of suffi cient size and density, bringing together enough susceptible bats to establish a critical basic reproductive rate of infection (28, 29) . The second amplifi cation peak after parturition was most probably associated with the establishment of a susceptible subpopulation of newborn bats who had not yet mounted their own adaptive immunity. Sporadic vertical transmission from mothers to pups as observed in Pteropus spp. bats artifi cially infected with Hendra virus would probably initiate this second wave of infection (30) . The main driver of the second wave would then be a horizontal transmission between pups. The latency between parturition and the second wave of virus amplifi cation indicates a certain level of perinatal protection conferred by mothers during the fi rst weeks of life as demonstrated for other small mammals, and as indirectly suggested for bats (13, (31) (32) (33) . This protection may be differentially effective against different viruses, as indicated by the differential amplifi cation patterns between CoVs and AstVs. While CoVs were amplifi ed both in 2008 and 2010, AstVs underwent postparturition amplifi cation only in 2010 when a new virus lineage gained predominance in the population. This fi nding strongly indicates antigenspecifi c immune control of virus circulation. A common, but unproven, assumption is that bats are resistant to even highly pathogenic viruses (2, 3) . In this study, we have correlated direct measurements of virus burden with the reproductive success of a bat colony. The rate of successful reproduction is probably a sensitive indicator of the presence or absence of disease, given the tenuous conditions under which bats breed in temperate climates. Indeed, no effects of CoV and AstV on reproduction were initially apparent; although postparturition amplifi cation of both viruses was more effi cient in 2010 than in 2008, the overall breeding success was signifi cantly better in 2010. This result may merely have been a consequence of a positive correlation between virus amplifi cation and colony size, which was larger in 2010 due to better breeding success. On the other hand, the individual prenatal amplifi cation peaks of both CoV and AstV were higher in 2010, which may have enabled better perinatal protection and thus better survival of newborns. The grouping of large numbers of pregnant females before birth is a specifi c characteristic of bats that may contribute to their puzzling ability to maintain highly pathogenic viruses without experiencing die-offs. Our noninvasive approach did not allow any further analyses such as the testing of blood and colostrum samples for antibodies. Nevertheless, the general picture obtained in this study by correlating virus and bat population dynamics suggests that bats control infections in similar ways to other mammals, and that they may well experience virus epidemics.",

            "text": "Another intriguing fi nding of our study was the difference in the amplifi cation pattern of the RNA viruses and that of the DNA virus. We selected these viruses because, in humans, AdVs are typically capable of persisting in tissue (34) and thus do not depend so much on continuous transmission and consistent amplifi cation on the population level. Indeed, it appeared that AdV did not make use of periodic amplifi cation in our bat colony. Persistence on the level of individual bats is more common for DNA viruses than for RNA viruses. RNA viruses ensure that they are maintained on a population level by a much higher error rate of the enzymes they use for genome replication and consequent higher levels of antigenic variability, causing waves of epidemic spread as confi rmed for bat-borne RNA viruses in this study. This factor can explain why most emerging viruses, including those from bats, are indeed RNA viruses (2, 35) . For CoV, our study indicates clearly that virus amplifi cation takes place in maternity colonies, confi rming our earlier statistical implications from studies in a different region and on a different species (16) . High peak RNA concentrations in the range of 10 9 -10 10 copies/g were observed, which is tremendously higher than CoV concentrations observed in earlier studies outside the parturition period (19) . Similarly high RNA virus concentrations are observed in human diseases transmitted through the fecal-oral route, e.g., picornaviruses or noroviruses, which suggests that maternity roosts may involve an elevated risk of virus transmission to other hosts. It is interesting to reconsider the potential genesis of the SARS epidemic in this light. Although an origin of SARS-related CoV in bats is confi rmed (9, 36) , SARS-CoV precursors have existed in carnivores some time before the SARS epidemic and have been transmitted from carnivores to humans again at least one additional time after the end of the epidemic (37, 38) . these data provide an intriguing explanation of how the SARS agent may have left its original reservoir (39, 40) . The data also indicate a feasible and ecologically sensible means of prevention. Because carnivores are known to enter maternity roosts to feed on dead newborn bats, bat maternity roosts should be left undisturbed by humans and kept inaccessible to domestic cats and dogs. ",
