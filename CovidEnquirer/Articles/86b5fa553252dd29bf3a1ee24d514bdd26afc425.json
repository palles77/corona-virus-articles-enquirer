The 2009 H1N1 Influenza A pandemic illustrated the importance of diagnostics to detect and identify respiratory viruses, and in general, accurate diagnostics are important in infectious disease management, making treatment decisions, and for novel pathogen discovery (Mahony, 2010; Mahony et al., 2011; Swayne and Spackman, 2013) . Viral diagnostics have migrated from culture to rapid and molecular methodologies, and more laboratories are utilizing these methods (Mahony, 2010; Mahony et al., 2011) . Respiratory virus diagnostics, such as culture, immunologic techniques, sequencing, and molecular diagnostics, have advantages and disadvantages. Culture has low complexity but also low sensitivity and requires viable organism. Immunologic techniques like direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) are rapid but can be laborious and have lower sensitivity than molecular diagnostics. Sequencing provides substantial information but is technically complex and impractical. Molecular diagnostics, although fairly complex, are becoming the preferred technology because of high sensitivity and shorter testing time.",

A limited number of parainfluenza 1-3 positives (n = 11) evaluated contributed to this; it does not appear that sample quality or volume was an issue because if this were the case, the results would be affected across all positive samples. The parainfluenza 1-3 false negatives as well as other false-negative results from the study were potentially because of the quantity of virus in the sample tested was below the limit of detection of 150 copies per well for all viruses the RVS primers amplify (Chen et al., 2011b) .",

No further analysis was performed on discrepant results due to low sample and nucleic acid extract volumes after RT-PCR/ESI-MS testing was completed. This was especially the case for the DFA-negative/RT-PCR/ESI-MS-positive samples ( Table 1) . Comparison of DFA with RT-PCR/ESI-MS was problematic because comparison of a non-amplified diagnostic, DFA, with an amplified diagnostic, RT-PCR/ESI-MS, may have skewed the RT-PCR/ESI-MS performance characteristics. Additionally, all of the xTAG RVPpositive results were initially DFA negative, and this discrepancy was also problematic. Additionally, DFA could have generated falsepositive results, as 3 DFA-positive detections were not confirmed by RT-PCR/ESI-MS or xTAG RVP. A more accurate comparison would have utilized 2 amplified tests, such as xTAG RVP and type specific realtime PCR. Although DFA comparison was suboptimal, it was the best available comparison method based on clinical virology screening algorithms used to report respiratory virus diagnoses. Finally, xTAG RVP assay was only performed on DFA-negative samples collected among immunocompromised patient negatives as per clinical virology testing algorithm policy. Many DFA-negative samples collected among immunocompetent patients could have tested positive with xTAG RVP. Additionally, the DFA negative, RT-PCR/ESI-MS false positives (Table 1. ) could have been more accurately confirmed if RT-PCR/ESI-MS and xTAG RVP had been directly compared for those samples.",
