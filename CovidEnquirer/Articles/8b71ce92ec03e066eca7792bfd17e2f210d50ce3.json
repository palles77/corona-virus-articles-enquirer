This could then led to the untimely discover and quarantine patients infected with SARS-COV-2, further aggravate the epidemics. Outside Hubei Province, sporadic and clustered cases have continuously reported within China, and most of the provinces and municipalities had confirmed around 50-1000 cases. Other countries including USA, South Korea, Japan and etc, also had sporadic and clustered reports 5, 6, [8] [9] [10] . Currently, the epidemics control outside Hubei province and other countries has entered into a critical stage. To control and eliminate the epidemics is still the main task till now; thus to prevent a single spark to start a prairie fire, as what we had observed in Wuhan, is critical. Therefore, optimizing diagnostic strategy is urgent and essential for the future global SARS-COV-2 control and prevention.",

A study involving 1099 patients have shown that around 76.4% of the laboratory-confirmed SARS-COV-2 patients had novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) on admission, and usually exhibited typical radiological finding of the ground-glass opacity (50%) or bilateral patchy shadowing (46%) 11 . However, the specificity of chest CT is relatively low. Currently, the golden standard for the NCP diagnosis is a positive result in real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay or metagenomics sequencing for respiratory specimens, including nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens, sputum, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 12 . Importantly, RT-PCR is required to be performed at least twice for suspected cases on both admission day 0 and day 2 to achieve two negative results in order for the patients to be released. However, recently, physicians around china has reported cases of NCP that had 2 or even 3 continuous negative RT-PCR results for nasopharyngeal and throat swab specimens before finally laboratory-confirmed 13 . According to the recent \"Diagnosis and Treatment Guideline for New Coronavirus Pneumonia (the fifth edition), China\", CT imaging results were used as the clinical diagnostic criteria for NCP, but strictly limited in Hubei Province 14 . This phenomenon raised national concerns and discussions about how to improve the diagnostic strategy of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) under the current circumstances.",

Meanwhile, some patients having severe symptoms had relatively low virus loads detected form nasal swab samples. For example, patient no.92 were admitted into hospital with severe pneumonia and an oxygen saturation of below 93%; however, the SARS-COV-2 viral loads of his sample is 3.1X10 3 copies/\u03bcl while mNGS detected 1,216 unique reads, relatively lower than other NCP patients (Supplement 1). A possible explanation could be that NCP patients' lesions tends to be located in the lower respiratory tract, causing the RT-PCR positivity of the upper respiratory tract sampling to be reduced. Other factors such as RNA extraction efficacy, quality of kit or potential interference of multiple primers could also affect the detection of RT-PCR assay. Possible mutation in primer or probes regions could lead to false-negative detection, albeit these regions are very reserved. Although from WGS data, we haven't found any mutation in the primer regions in these patients, however, such risk always exits. The primer design also partially relies on the chosen gene. Orf1ab and S gene are very specific genes that can effectively distinguish COVID-19 from other coronaviruses (including SARS and SARS like viruses), which have been used to design specific PCR detection primers. N and E genes of the SARS-CoV-2 may form cross-reaction with other coronaviruses.",

            "text": "Metagenomic sequencing was the method by which SARS-COV-2 was initially identified. Despite its longer turnaround time and higher cost, mNGS demonstrated a satisfying level of sensitivity when compared to PCR assays in our study. Moreover, the nature of unbiased sequencing offers higher tolerance for genetic drift in the target pathogens, whereas certain changes in sequence can result in critical impact on the assay efficiency 21, 22 . Along with targeted assays, mNGS should serve as an indispensable tool for sensitive and close monitoring of the molecular evolution for SARS-COV-2. Such genetic information will offer valuable insights not only for public health management, but also for contentious optimization of diagnostic assays 23, 24 . Therefore, as the SARS-COV-2 epidemic is currently entering into a critical stage, both within China and over the global 25 , according to the results of our study, the following improvements in molecular diagnosis are recommended in the optimized diagnostic flow diagram [ Figure  5 ]. First of all, repeated sampling could increase the positivity, and especially during clinical situations where epidemiological history and clinical manifestations highly indicate NCP, a third or fourth sampling may be helpful when resources are available. Second, our study showed that mNGS showed reliable and stable detection ability in the NCP diagnosis, and may facilitate to solve diagnostic difficulties during important or critical clinical cases and low positive RT-PCR results. What's more, in order to circumvent possible mutations in RT-PCR primers region, more than 1 gene target was recommended to amplify when designing RT-PCR assays [25] . Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) method can overcome the mutation problems which cause false-negative result in RT-PCR. Therefore, we used this method in all enrolled patients and should be continue using for mutation surveillance. Lastly, lower respiratory tract specimens might provide higher positivity, due to that higher viral loads may be detected there. Therefore, physicians might collect such samples through bronchoscopy or trachea cannula when under through medical protection.",

Chest CT alone could not precisely diagnose COVID-2019 due to similar radiological presentations. Co-infection of other pathogens with SARS-COV-2 exists and should be acknowledged. What's more, different sampling approaches may also affect the results, therefore, in highly suspected cases but with two negative SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR results, repeated sampling or change of sample type could increase the positive rate.

Currently, non-SARS-COV-2 pathogens are still very common in suspected patients in Eastern China region. We applied metagenomic sequencing for SARS-COV-2 identification in these samples. Out of the 53 suspected samples, we were able to identify 20 SARS-COV-2-positive cases, all 17 of RT-PCR positive samples were mNGS positive and 3 repeated RT-PCR negative patients were also tested positive during mNGS. The metagenomics results showed median reads of all SARS-COV-2-positive cases per million of 99 (1-688,541), a median genome coverage of 35.0% (1.2-99.9%) and a median sequencing depth of 24x (1x-7453) (Supplement 3). The SARS-COV-2 reads showed by metagenomics are positively correlated with SARS-COV-2 copies by RT-PCR (Spearman correlation, r=-0.736, P<0.001). The great degree of variations shown in these sequencing outputs suggests a broad range of viral titer in SARS-COV-2 infections.",

One patient didn't have any typical epidemiology history. Half of the NCP patients were male, with a median age of 37 years. The most common symptoms at onset of NCP were fever (16 [80%]), dry cough (11 [55%]), diarrhea (3 [15%]), and headache (3 [15%]). Less common symptoms were fatigue, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Three patients were diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Importantly, the symptoms of NCP patients were very similar with non-NCP patients in our study. The blood counts of enrolled NCP patients showed less white blood cells, neutrophils and platelet count than non-NCP patients (P<0.05).
