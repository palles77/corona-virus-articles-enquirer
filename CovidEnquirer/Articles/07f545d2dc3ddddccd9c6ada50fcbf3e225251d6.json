With statistics of daytime observations during summer in Hong Kong as an example, this study demonstrates that neutral atmospheric boundary conditions occur with a very low probability, which implies that current practices are indeed far away from reality. This study is devoted to addressing this knowledge gap by cross-comparisons of field measurements, wind tunnel tests, and large-eddy simulations (LES) under neutral and unstable conditions. It is found that LEScomputed velocity ratios under unstable conditions are in line with field measurements, while results of simulations under neutral conditions are close to those of wind tunnel tests. Enhanced vertical mixing due to surface heating produces improved ventilation performance in the unstable case. The neutral assumption tends to underestimate pedestrian-level velocity ratios compared to a diabatic condition; hence it is deemed conservative when it is adopted in AVA practices. Moreover, stronger wind direction variance under unstable conditions results in weaker correlation between velocity ratios and frontal area indices than neutral conditions, which implies that street orientations become less important in ventilation under unstable conditions.",

These two documents, setting out the framework and requiring all major government departments to include AVA as one of their planning and design considerations, were the first to address weak wind problems [5] . Unlike the guidelines of many countries for dealing with wind gust problems, the Hong Kong AVA is specifically designed to deal with weak wind conditions in congested urban areas under a hot and humid subtropical climate [4] .

One possible cause is that the current AVA methodology adopts the neutral assumption for the atmospheric boundary condition, which is justified only when mechanical turbulence has a greater influence on ventilation than buoyancy-induced turbulence under high background wind speed. However, the neutral assumption does not adequately represent the actual situation, as the daytime atmospheric boundary is likely to be unstably stratified, particularly under clear sky and low wind conditions [7] . More importantly, the most crucial situations for urban ventilation are those in which only a low-speed background wind is present. The neutral assumption that supposes that buoyancy-induced turbulence has only a minor influence on ventilation is not true in such a condition.",

Meanwhile, many urban ventilation studies have used wind tunnel testing and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models with a neutral assumption [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . But very few studies have addressed the effects of diabatic conditions on urban ventilation. A study of thermal effects on turbulence coherent structures found that when thermal effects are included by surface heating in large-eddy simulation (LES), the spanwise flow is stronger within an idealized building array compared to the neutral case [16] . Another LES study suggested that roof heating, in combination with building walls and ground heating, is important in the strength and location of the canyon vortex [17] . Both of these LES studies used idealized urban geometries (cubical building arrays). Using Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of two simplified Hong Kong city models, Yang and Li pointed out that airflow in street canyons is dependent on thermal stratification when wind speed is small relative to the buoyancy force [18] . However, how pedestrianlevel ventilation under thermal stratification differs from neutral conditions in a realistic urban complex is indistinct.",

When thermal conditions, specifically unstable stratification, are considered in ventilation, there will be additional challenges: First, a larger model domain is required to catch the larger turbulent structures in unstable simulations than in the neutral condition, while the grid size has to be kept small to sufficiently resolve the street-level air flows [19] . Second, special attention should be paid to the lateral boundary conditions to ensure that they will not artificially modify the wind environment within the assessment region. For instance, the radiative outflow condition in the non-cyclic boundary requires a positive outflow at all times [20, 21] . Therefore, while a weak background wind is provided for generating buoyancy-driven turbulence, extra model domain is needed on the leeward side of the city. This also requires extra computational cost. Third, more uncertainties will be incorporated in the estimation of initial thermal conditions. Heat fluxes are more difficult to monitor than winds. In such cases, validation of model results can be another obstacle.",

Thresholds for wind speed and cloud cover are quantitatively specified, while the threshold for daytime insolation is given only qualitatively, in terms of \"strong,\" \"moderate,\" and \"slight,\" which has to be transferred as specific values. Based on hourly observations of global solar radiation from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. on summer days, the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles are computed as 0.16, 0.79, and 1.84 MJ m \u22122 , respectively. According to Table 1 , daytime stability is classified. For example, when wind speed is lower than 2, classifications A and B are divided by the 50th percentile of solar radiation; when wind speed is between 2 and 3, classifications A and B are divided by the 75th percentile of solar radiation, classifications B and C are divided by the 25th percentile, and so forth. The probability of various classes of stability is calculated using all summer data during 2006-2015. The estimated result suggests that neutral conditions occur with a very low probability of about only 2%; even the weak unstable class C occurs less than 20% of the time. During most of the daytime (about 80%), atmospheric stratification in urban Hong Kong can be classified as moderate and strongly unstable (classes B and A). However, the estimation may not be very accurate due to some deficiencies of this methodology. There are three limitations to the use of the Pasquill stability classification scheme: First, the Pasquill scheme is widely used mainly because it requires only routine meteorological data, but it was originally developed in the United Kingdom at a location some miles from the coast, and should be restricted to the insolation values and climate conditions there. It has been found that various stability classification methods result in large discrepancies [23] . Second is the restriction of local observations to Hong Kong. HKO is one of the two sites that have cloud cover observations (the other site is Hong Kong International Airport). It is located in a small park that is surrounded by a high-density urban area in Tsim Sha Tsui (Fig. 1) , with an altitude of 32 m above mean sea level. KP is surrounded by a relatively larger green space on a small hill with an altitude of 65 m on the Kowloon Peninsula. The uncertainties introduced to the classification of stability by such environmental conditions are difficult to control. Finally, there is no information available as to how the parameters of strong, moderate, and slight should be chosen when the Pasquill scheme is used locally in Hong Kong.",

The size of the recycling area is 480 m by 1 km, and it is 520 m away from the city area. The 520 m \u00d7 1 km buffer zone between x recycle and the city helps prevent the blocking effects of the buildings from reaching the recycling area, while the 1 km \u00d7 1 km buffer zone on the leeward side of the city helps ensure a positive outflow. As introduced, the radiative outflow condition in this non-cyclic boundary always requires a positive outflow. The topography was rotated 180\u00b0( north is downward) due to the requirement of the turbulence-recycling method that inflow must come from the left. Horizontal grid spacing is equidistantly 2 m. Grid-sensitive tests using PALM 4.0 for urban ventilation simulations have been conducted in recent studies and suggest that a grid size of 2 m is sufficient for such a task [19, 45] . Vertical grid spacing is 2 m below 300 m and is stretched with a stretch factor of 1.08 above. With 195 vertical levels, the top level is at about 1072 m. In the LES model, scalar variables are defined at the grid centers, while velocity components are shifted by half of the grid spacing. Therefore, horizontal wind velocity output from the 1 m and 3 m levels is linearly interpolated (averaged) to obtain V P at 2 m above the ground. The no-slip bottom boundary condition and the freeslip top boundary condition are applied to the horizontal velocity components. A cyclic (periodic) boundary condition setup in the spanwise direction is implemented.",

Under such low wind conditions, the influence of buoyancy-induced turbulence becomes important, and ventilation will depend on the balance between thermal forcing and wind forcing. In addition, if high wind speed is used, more computational time will be needed because the time step has to be shorter. But a low background wind speed also requires a large buffer zone behind the city to ensure a positive outflow (Fig. 5) . The time step lengths are optimized in the LES model. In the LES experiments described below, the mean time step lengths are between 0.34 s (for the unstable cases) and 0.68 s (for the neutral case). A 1 h precursor run, with a horizontal domain of 240 m \u00d7 240 m and the same height as the main run, is promoted for generating initial turbulent inflow profiles. The total simulation time for the main run is 2 h. The first hour is excluded in the analysis of the results, as the turbulences need this time to spin-up. The simulated results of the second hour are averaged for analysis.",

More importantly, prescribed heat fluxes are generated from building rooftops and side walls. As in a realistic urban area with rather complex urban form, the thermal conditions and their balance with the velocity field are difficult to quantitatively decide by heat flux Table 3 for details. generation in the numerical simulation. Therefore, we carry out a set of test runs, namely T 0 , T 1 , T 2 , and T 3 , with various prescribed rooftop and side wall heat flux settings, as listed in Table 3 . We deem that the approaching winds are always under neutral stratification due to general high wind speeds and very small surface roughness over open sea waters.

Evaluating our LES results in Table 3 by this set of tested values in wind tunnel experiments of unstable stratification, T 1 , with an R b of \u22120.2, is deemed to be the best at reproducing a typical unstable stratified urban boundary layer.

Hourly wind speed observed at Waglan Island at 4 p.m. on 19 September 2006 is 6.4 ms -1 . The wind speeds in Table 2 are divided by this value to gain the field-measured VR.",

The mean values given in Table 4 show that the LES experiment under neutral conditions is more comparable to the wind tunnel tests, while the LES experiment under unstable conditions is more comparable to the field measurements. This is further demonstrated in the scatter plots and linear regressions in Fig. 8 . Fig. 8 shows that the wind tunnel predicts a relatively lower VR compared to field measurements, with a regression coefficient of 0.51 in Fig. 8a .

In order to obtain more data samples, the averaging areas overlap. This is also a way to guarantee that the results are not influenced by random positioning of the averaging areas. In this procedure, the first averaging area covers a 100 m \u00d7 100 m region in one corner, say, the left-bottom corner of the city domain. The next averaging area moves 20 m (10 model grids) forward in one (x or y) direction, and so forth. In this way, a total of 2116 data samples are obtained in the 1 km 2 city domain. The VRs are also averaged in such a way in both the neutral and unstable cases. Fig. 15a demonstrates that pedestrian-level VR under neutral conditions gives a correlation of \u22120.45 with the \u03bb f , which is significantly larger than \u22120.25 in the unstable case. Hence, street orientation seems to be less important for urban ventilation under unstable conditions due to larger wind direction variance compared to neutral conditions. The limitation of this is that the relationship between ventilation and \u03bb f is hard to justify given that only one wind angle is tested. Fig. 15b further demonstrates a scatter plot and regression between VR and the ground coverage ratio (\u03bb p ), which is defined as the ratio of ground area that is covered by the building to the site area. This parameter is computed using the same averaging areas and moving-window algorithm that were used in the calculation of \u03bb f . More importantly, \u03bb p is independent of wind direction. Fig. 15 suggests that the correlation between VR and \u03bb p is higher than that between VR and \u03bb f in both the neutral and unstable cases. The VR under neutral conditions gives a correlation of \u22120.51 with \u03bb p , which is still larger than \u22120.4 in the unstable case (Fig. 15b) . One possible cause is that stronger convective motion (Fig. 12 ) and greater wind direction variance (Fig. 14) in the unstable case reduce the effects of urban form and urban density on ventilation. Nevertheless, these results are still restricted by the limited domain and the complexity of the realistic urban morphology tested in the simulations. Future studies using parametric urban forms and urban densities while considering more input wind directions should be conducted to expand the preliminary result of this study.",

Such findings theoretically agree with our knowledge that near-surface wind speed over boundary-layer velocity should be significantly larger in unstable stratification than in neutral stratification (Fig. 10) . The major cause is additional convective motion caused by surface heating, which increases vertical mixing throughout the boundary layer in and above the city.

Urban ventilation studies under stable atmospheric conditions are difficult due to a lack of in situ observations, and modeling (with a wind tunnel or CFD) of this type of thermal stratification is challenging. But the effects of a stably stratified boundary on urban ventilation should be the subject of a future study. According to Fig. 10 , stable boundary conditions may be the worst situation for urban ventilation, as they produce the smallest near-surface velocity over boundary-layer velocity compared to the other two types of conditions, and the background wind is generally not very strong (Table 1) .",

VRs in the unstable LES case are in line with field measurements, while those in the neutral case are close to the wind tunnel tests. Overall ventilation under unstable conditions is found to be better than that under neutral conditions. Current AVA practices under the neutral assumption are conservative if the actual situation includes an unstably stratified boundary layer. Enhanced convective motion due to surface heating in unstable conditions is the main reason the neutral assumption can be conservative. Moreover, stronger wind direction variance under unstable conditions results in weaker correlation between VRs and frontal area indices than under neutral conditions. This implies that street orientation is less important in street-level ventilation under unstable conditions than in neutral conditions, due to the importance of surface heating effects in unstable conditions.",
