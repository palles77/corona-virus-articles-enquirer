            "text": "Backyard poultry tend to be kept extensively, with the main purposes of companionship, egg production for human consumption, and occasionally breeding of replacement birds. Primarily, owners source their hens from pullet rearers or acquire former commercial laying hens. A female chicken is a 'pullet' once she is no longer a 'chick' (i.e., she has lost her feathery chick down and acquired adult feathering) but has not reached sexual maturity and laid an egg. Point-of-lay pullets are sold between 16 to 18 weeks of age, with the expectation that they will come into lay in the following month. The onset of lay is governed by three factors: the pullet being sufficiently old, being in adequate body condition, and subject to the correct light stimulation. There is a huge variation in the size of pullet rearing enterprises with many different breeds being reared, ranging from small silkies to the much larger Rhode Island Red. Former commercial hens will be acquired at the end of their commercial viability, which is typically 72 weeks of age. The four commercial systems used in the UK are: enriched cages, barn production, free range, and organic free range. Production can range from between 300 and 340 eggs per hen with the more intensive systems, resulting in the highest production figures. The commercial breeds commonly seen include Hyline, Lohmann, Bovan, and Novogen. The primary breed companies that produce these birds are a very good source of information on their husbandry and maximising their genetic reproductive potential (e.g., Hyline Website 2016 , Lohmann Website 2011 .",

In fact, they are often perceived as a nuisance due to their early morning crowing and aggressive/protective behaviour. Many owners do put up with these inconveniences and have a cockerel in the flock, as there is a perception that this maintains a more natural flock dynamic. If fertilisation of eggs does occur but there is no incubation either naturally with broody hens or artificially with incubators, then there is no embryonic development, and the eggs are fit for human consumption. A few backyard flock keepers have birds that are intended to produce fertile eggs for incubation and chick production. For the amateur enthusiast, this can be frustrating because veterinary intervention is required to investigate any combination of low egg production, low fertility, low hatchability, and poor chick viability.",

Although the right one is present embryologically, it regresses during development and is vestigial in the adult bird.

The age at which the removal of the functional ovary occurs determines the future development of the rudiment. If the ovary is removed from chickens younger than 20 days old, the rudiment hypertrophies into a structure resembling a testis and is capable of spermatogenesis. However, because the Wolffian duct system does not develop in genetic females, there is no duct connection between the testis and the copulatory organ in the cloaca.

They then enter the final rapid growth phase, with deposition of yellow yolk, which has lipids along with water, proteins, minerals, and vitamins. Follicles grow to larger than 35 mm in 7 to 11 days in the domestic hen. Developing follicles are an oocyte, surrounded by granulosa cells, and an outer layer of thecal cells. There is no fluid-filled cavity; the entire follicle is filled with yolk material. In the avian ovary, follicles do not mature synchronously; there is a hierarchy of maturation with the largest most orange coloured follicle being the next to ovulate. The next largest follicle will ovulate 25 hours later, and so on. Usually a hen's ovary has up to 10 follicles containing yolk, a larger number of small yellow follicles, and numerous small white follicles awaiting recruitment or atresia.",

The daily removal of laid eggs and the reproductive physiology of an indeterminate layer can result in over 300 eggs per hen being laid over a 12-month period. Physiologically, she is striving to establish a clutch of eggs but is being thwarted on a daily basis by the stock keeper. After a clutch of eggs are laid, a hen's behaviour changes, and she becomes broody. This may be a desired quality if the owner wishes a hen to incubate her own fertilised eggs; it may be an undesirable trait if the purpose of the hen is to lay eggs for human consumption or to produce fertile eggs for artificial incubation. To prevent broodiness, eggs should be collected daily, and there should be few dimly lit hiding places for a hen in her enclosure. From an endocrinological perspective the following is occurring:",

The purpose of brooding is to keep the eggs warm. The hen develops a brood patch ( Fig. 30 .10) towards the end of the egg laying period, and the skin becomes oedematous and highly vascularised. Brood patches develop in response to ovarian steroid exposure. The tactile simulation of the defeathered, oedematous brood patch triggers transition from egg laying to brooding due to prolactin release. The blood flow to the brood patch is greatly increased, such that the heat from skin in this area incubates the eggs. Sensory fibres detect skin temperature where there is skin-toegg contact. If the hen's body temperature falls she will shiver to generate heat and increase her metabolism to ensure that eggs are at the optimal temperature for incubation.

If it is excessively too hot, there will be embryo mortality, resulting in reduced hatchability. Too cool a hatchery delays the rate of embryonic development. Temperature fluctuations cause embryo 'stress' -reduced hatchability, reduced chick viability.

Hens can suffer from dystocia in which an egg becomes trapped in the vagina. The trapped egg may be visible on examination and will certainly be palpable. Large eggs (especially those with two yolks) are a contributing factor, as are hypocalcaemia, obesity, and early onset of lay. It may be possible to assist the expulsion of the egg with adequate lubrication. Initially, intramuscular calcium supplementation can help in the form of calcium gluconate followed by calcium glubionate or calcium carbonate orally. Some veterinary surgeons advocate breaking the offending egg. However, though this may rectify the immediate problem, it does predispose the bird to developing salpingitis. If the flock is laying a high percentage of double yolked eggs, slow down the decay of the DNA required for testing. DNA is extracted from the vascular material lining the eggshell membrane.

Eight days postinfection, there is a massive growth in the pouch cell gland region of the oviduct, coincident with the occurrence of egg shell changes. Progeny from these infected eggs can hatch and appear clinically normal but latently infected. When a latently infected individual reaches peak lay, the virus is reactivated. The virus can be transmitted vertically and should an unprotected flock become infected during lay, the egg drop can be profound. Transmission is possible horizontally via the faecal/ oral route. Classically an infected flock will initially show a loss of shell pigmentation, followed by thin shelled, soft shelled, and shell-less eggs. There is an apparent drop in egg production, though overall production may be normal, but there will be fewer normal eggs. It has been calculated that the loss equates to about 10 to 16 eggs per hen when a na\u00efve flock is infected (Pattison et al. 2008 ). Confirmation of a challenge is possible with rising antibody titres on paired serology or PCR testing (assuming isolation of the virus is not required). No treatment is available, but even in small flocks, vaccination should be considered. The only licenced EDS vaccines in the UK and internationally are polyvalent inactivated vaccines.

With high levels of biosecurity and good screening programmes, eradication of MG has been possible in commercial primary breeding flocks.

Bacterial infections are often associated with poor husbandry and cleanliness, which can be traced back to the breeder flock, egg store, hatchery, or brooding hut. Pathogenical E. coli infections are the most common cause of lesions to the umbilicus and yolk sac. The umbilicus can be large, swollen, and reddened with the body wall becoming oedematous and discoloured; if this is extensive, the specimens are referred to",
