The emergence of multi-drug resistant strains over the past years has led to considerations about an enhanced surveillance of bacterial food contamination. Currently, ELISA is the method of choice for high throughput identification of S. Typhimurium. The sensitivity and specificity of this assay might be improved by application of new diagnostic antibodies. We focused on plant-based expression of candidate diagnostic TM43-E10 antibodies discovered using as antigen the S. Typhimurium OmpD protein. The scFv-TM43-E10 and scFv-Fc-TM43-E10 antibody derivatives have been successfully produced in N. benthamiana using a deconstructed movementdeficient PVX vector supplemented with the gb silencing suppressor from Poa semilatent virus. The plant-made antibodies showed the same antigen-binding specificity as that of the microbial/mammalian cell-produced counterparts and could recognize the OmpD antigen in S. Typhimurium infected plant samples.",

It can also be found in non-alcoholic beer or seafood. Human infections with phage type S. Typhimurium DT104 are particularly critical, because this strain is resistant to most of the commonly used antibiotics [1] . Therefore, continuous monitoring of bacterial food contamination is necessary to prevent infections in humans. Established methods for S. Typhimurium diagnostics are time-consuming and use microbiological cultures on different liquid and solid media [2] , specific fluorescence labeled DNA probes [3] or PCR [4] . Currently, high throughput diagnostics of S. Typhimurium is performed by indirect ELISA [5] . The commercially available ELISA kits, SALMOTYPE 1 -or Enterisol 1 -ELISA, use a mixture of O-antigens of Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovars. Because of this mixture, cross-reactions occur with other bacteria [6] . In addition, the sensitivity varies between the different ELISA assays [7] .",

Deconstructed versions of RNA viruses like, Potato virus X [21] , Tobacco mosaic virus [22, 23] , Cowpea mosaic virus [24] , as well as DNA viruses like Beet curly top virus [25] , have been developed and successfully applied to produce recombinant proteins in plants.

The scFv is a smallest of the recombinant antibody formats, which is capable of antigen binding. It consists only of the variable (V) antibody regions (VL and VH) connected with a short linker peptide. The scFv-Fc fragment combines the VL, VH and Fc regions of the IgG. The scFv-Fc format might offer several advantages over the phage display-derived scFv, including bivalent binding, longer half-life and Fc-mediated effector functions [12] .

            "text": "The transient expression exploiting Agrobacterium-mediated delivery of expression vectors has become the preferred plantbased platform due to its advantage in speed, yield of recombinant proteins and the reduced concern for transgene escape. Transient recombinant protein production depends on both the expression vector and the plant host. Currently two types of expression vectors, non-viral or plant virus-based, can be used for transient protein production. Expression vectors utilizing a plastocyanin promoter [37] and the 5 0 -and 3 0 -translated region of CPMV [38] are the most efficient non-viral systems described in the literature. The latest development in plant virus vectors is the vector deconstruction strategy. Deconstructed viral vectors based on TMV [18] , CPMV [39] , PVX [21] and BeYDV [40] provide high protein yield through a reduction to components essential for recombinant protein production. In comparison to a deleted PVX vector developed by Giritch et al. [21] , the PVX vector described in this work uses the fused TGB1 and coat protein subgenomic promoter for foreign gene expression and is completely deficient in cell-tocell and long distance movement. We have taken advantage of Agrobacterium-mediated delivery of an expression cassette controlled by the 35S promoter. Infiltration of N. benthamiana leaves with pLH-PVX-m and pLH-gb-PVX-m vectors carrying scFv and scFv-Fc formats of a TM43-E10 antibody resulted in accumulation of mRNA and proteins as was evidenced by qPCR, Western blot analysis and ELISA. One of the factors reducing the efficiency of transient expression is mRNA degradation by RNA silencing. The gene silencing is involved in regulating expression of endogenous genes as well as reducing or eliminating the effects of invading pathogens such as viruses [41, 42] . To neutralize this silencing response and enhance the level of foreign gene expression, co-expression of proteins that are capable to interfere with components of this resistance is used routinely. These factors are known as \"suppressors\" of RNA silencing. So far, several suppressors of RNA silencing have been evaluated for their ability to counteract gene silencing and enhance foreign gene expression in transient assay, including p19 from either Artichoke mottled crinkle virus (AMCV) [43] or Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) [44] , HcPro from Potato virus Y (PVY) [37] , p25 from PVX [45] and gb from Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) [46] . We investigated the influence of the gb protein from Poa semilatent virus (PSLV) on foreign protein accumulation in a transient assay. PSLV is a plus-strand RNA virus of the genus Hordeivirus with a tripartite genome consisting of RNA\u03b1, RNA\u03b2 and RNAg. RNA\u03b1 encodes a component of viral replicase. RNA \u03b2 encodes coat protein and three movement proteins. RNAg is bicistronic and encode the other component of viral replicase and a non-structural gb protein [47, 48] . gb contributes to symptom severity, systemic viral movement and RNA silencing suppression [33, 49] . Although the anti-silencing activity of PSLV gb protein has been shown a decade ago [33] , the mechanism of gb action has not been investigated. Several lines of evidence indicate that silencing suppressor properties of gb may be mediated by its RNA binding activities. The gb protein likely binds in a sequence unspecific manner to ssRNA via a coiled-coil domain with zinc binding sites, to prevent RNA degradation by RNA-induced silencing complex [33, 50] . In this study we demonstrate for the first time the effectiveness of gb to increase the recombinant protein expression level. The increased transcription of scFv-TM43-E10 and scFv-Fc-TM43-E10 genes was detected by qPCR analysis in N. benthamiana leaves agroinfiltrated with pLHgb-PVX-m vector when compared to pLH-PVX-m expression vector. The mRNA expression levels correlated with protein yields as was quantified by ELISA. Application of the gb silencing suppressor caused two and five fold increases in scFv-TM43-E10 and scFv-Fc-TM43-E10 accumulation, respectively.",

These accumulation levels are not superior to protein expression levels shown for the movement-competent deconstructed virus vectors [53] . However, the yields are comparable to the expression levels described for movementdeficient virus vectors and non-viral vectors [54] . Our transient expression system might be improved by directing scFv-Fc-TM43-E10 recombinant antibody into various cell compartments, particularly endoplasmatic reticulum (ER). Several studies demonstrated that the addition of a KDEL peptide to recombinant proteins has allowed efficient ER targeting and increased their accumulation in 2-10 times [37, 55, 56] . The expression profile in transient assay may be different for each product expressed. In most cases maximal expression levels occur at 3-5 days after infiltration and fade rapidly after 7-9 days. For example, the maximal accumulation for GFP, P24 and SARS-CoV proteins has been observed at 3 dpi [51, 57] . The highest expression level for L2 and non-structural HIV-1 Nef proteins was reached at 5 dpi and 9 dpi, respectively [45, 57] .

ELISA test of scFv-TM43-E10 and scFv-Fc-TM43-E10 antibody fragments. ELISA plates were coated with S. Typhimurium suspension (lane 1), protein extracts from S. Typhimurium infected (lanes 2-5) and non-infected (lane 6) salad leaf tissue. 400 ng/well for scFv-TM43-E10 and 150 ng/well for scFv-Fc-TM43-E10 were added for detection of OmpD antigen. Values represent the means with standard deviation from two independent tests. functional test. The antigen binding of plant-derived scFv-TM43-E10 antibodies was similar to scFv-TM43-E10 recombinant proteins isolated from E. coli. Furthermore functional ELISA test also showed a similar functional activity for plant and mammalian cell culture-made scFv-Fc-TM43-E10 antibody fragments (Fig. 5A ). Our data are in agreement with findings described in several articles with respect to the functional equivalence of the recombinant proteins produced in different expression systems. For example plant-derived 6D8 and hE16 mAbs demonstrated similar to mammalian cell-derived counterpart antigen specificity [58] . Yuan et al. [59] reported that the biological activity of antizearalenone scFv \"plantibody\" was comparable to that of a bacterially produced scFv antibody. A number of research groups investigated the binding properties of the plant-derived anti-HIV VRC01, 2G12 and b12 antibodies in comparison to reference counterparts [60] [61] [62] . These studies also revealed functional equivalence between plant-and mammalian cells-made recombinant proteins.",

Features are as follows: 165 K, RNA dependent RNA polymerase; 3 0 -UTR-tr, 3 0 non-translated region of PVX and terminator signal; 35S-gb-ter, expression cassette of PSLV gb silencing suppressor; scFv-TM43-E10, scFv-Fc-TM43-E10, recombinant antibody encoding sequences; Myc, Myc-tag; His, His-tag; single arrow, 35S promoter; double arrow, subgenomic RNA promoters. The bottom field represents the Myc-tag and His-tag sequences that were linked to the C-terminal end of the scFv-TM43-E10 antibody fragment. The location of restriction sites (XbaI, SmaI, SpeI, MluI, EcoRV, NsiI and ApaI), left (LB) and right (RB) borders are also shown.These expression vectors contain between the left and right T-DNA borders the CaMV 35S promoter, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene of PVX, double subgenomic promoter (TGB1 and coat protein subgenomic promoters), 3 0 nontranslated region of PVX and terminator. The pLH-gb-PVX-m vector includes an additional expression cassette for PSLV gb gene silencing suppressor. The scFv-TM43-E10 protein contains C-terminal Histag for affinity purification and Myc-tag for detection by Western blot.Four final transient expression vectors were transformed into A. tumefaciens and delivered by agroinfiltration into middle leaves of six-week old N. benthamiana plants (Figure S1). To evaluate the effect of the PSLV gb gene silencing suppressor on scFv-TM43-E10 and scFv-Fc-TM43-E10 accumulation agroinfiltrated N. benthamiana leaf samples were harvested at 5 dpi and investigated by qPCR and Western blot analysis. Plant probes were first examined for the presence of gb mRNA (Figure S2). RT-PCR analysis with gb specific primers confirmed the presence of gb mRNA in the pLH-gb-PVX-m agroinfiltrated leaves. There was not any PCR product in the pLH-PVX-m samples. An actin gene selected as an internal control confirmed the presence of cDNA in all investigated samples.",
