CoV was not detected in 212 fecal samples from Eidolon helvum fruit bats. Leaf-nosed bats pertaining to Hipposideros ruber by morphology had group 1 and group 2 CoVs. Virus concentrations were <45,000 copies/100 mg of bat feces. The diversified group 1 CoV shared a common ancestor with the human common cold virus hCoV-229E but not with hCoV-NL63, disputing hypotheses of common human descent. The most recent common ancestor of hCoV-229E and GhanaBt-CoVGrp1 existed in \u22481686-1800 ad. The GhanaBt-CoVGrp2 shared an old ancestor (\u22482,400 years) with the severe acute respiratory syndrome-like group of CoV.",

They are classified into 3 groups, which contain viruses pathogenic for mammals (groups 1 and 2) and poultry (group 3) (1). Hu-man CoVs (hCoVs)-229E, -NL63, -OC43, and -HKU1 are endemic worldwide and cause mainly respiratory infections in children and adults. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a novel zoonotic coronavirus that caused an international epidemic in 2002-2003. Fortunately, efficient public health management interrupted this epidemic (2) . Studies conducted in China in the aftermath of the SARS epidemic have identified CoVs in bats (Chiroptera) and implicated this speciose mammalian order as the most likely reservoir of all known coronaviruses (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . Among the most urgent concerns prompted by the SARS epidemic is the likelihood of similar future events. Thus, it seems highly relevant to study the ecology of bat CoVs in terms of diversity, host restriction, virus prevalence, risk of exposure, and the circumstances of past host transition events.",

Phylogenetic dating was conducted by using Bayesian evolutionary analysis sampling trees (BEAST) (22) .

A Bayes factor test conducted in TRACER yielded a strong estimate of superiority of the codon-based model over the GTR + \u03934 + I model (log 10 Bayes factor 139 [20 is highly significant]). To further optimize the prediction of MRCA dates, the constant population size assumption used in all analyses was exchanged against expansion growth or exponential growth assumptions. Both assumptions were predicted to fit the data better than the constant size model (Bayes factors 13.5 and 13.9). There was no difference between the expansion and exponential models (Bayes factor 0.34 in favor of expansion). The MRCA date of hCoV-229E and the GhanaBt-CoVGrp1 was 1686 (expansion) or 1800 (exponential growth). Table 2 summarizes the results.

We estimated the RNA concentration per full sample (100 mg feces = 2-4 fecal pellets) to be only up to 4.5 \u00d7 10 4 RNA copies. Human pathogenic viruses transmitted by the fecal-oral route generate much higher virus concentrations in stool, up to \u224810 12 RNA copies/mg, e.g., for different picornaviruses (30) (31) (32) . Based on these data it would be difficult to postulate that humans can acquire CoV from bat feces. However, studies in other locations and at different times are needed to address virus concentration in bat droppings in more detail. Because virus in this study was only observed in insectivorous bats and not in frugivorous bats, future studies should investigate whether insects might constitute a source of CoV infection for bats.",

However, in our study we sampled no more than 100 mg of feces per bat. All samples had to be collected in RNAlater solution (0.5 mL) (Applied Biosystems) for reasons of storage and transportation. Although it has been suggested that RNAlater solution may preserve virus infectivity (33, 34) , our observations showed that the solution has to be diluted at least 1:20 in cell culture medium to avoid cytotoxicity (data not shown). Because of the low virus RNA concentrations observed, we did not attempt to isolate the virus. However, the absence of successful virus isolation from bat feces in previous studies (3) (4) (5) (6) 8, 11, 12) may not reflect the incapability of bat CoV to infect human cells. Recently, a synthetic bat CoV complemented with an appropriate spike protein has shown potential to infect human cells (35) .",

            "text": "Reconstruction of phylogenetic and temporal relationships between bat CoV and other mammalian CoV is another way to obtain information on their zoonotic potential. Unfortunately, for CoV long sequence fragments must be analyzed before valid phylogenies can be inferred from the conserved nonstructural genome portion (28, 36) . Because of the low concentration of RNA in bat samples, generation of long sequences from novel bat CoV is tedious and technically demanding, which may be why some published phylogenies of bat CoV are based on short datasets, making it difficult to use these data for reference. For molecular clock dating, we have therefore relied on reference viruses mainly from other mammals that covered our 1,221-bp fragment in the conserved RdRp region. We assumed that the RdRp would be under less selective pressure than the structural genes and other nonstructural genes, and therefore could be used to infer nucleotide substitution rates over distantly related CoVs (7, 25, 26, (36) (37) (38) . We have confirmed all tree topologies using alternative methods of phylogenetic inference, including an MCMC algorithm implemented in MrBayes that eliminates artifacts contributed by fixation of MCMC chains in suboptimal prosterior probability maxima (20) . Calibration was conducted on reliable isolation dates of prototype and novel bat CoV from the literature, as well as on the MRCA of the hCoV-OC43/Bovine CoV clade. For dating of only this specific CoV clade, a wide range of dated virus isolates has been available that covered as much as 34% ) of the projected time of virus evolution from root to tip (1890-2004) (25) . A probabilistic calibration prior was used, which is favorable for dating in combination with relaxed molecular clock assumptions (39) . The determined mean substitution rates were in good concordance with earlier studies on non-bat-CoV that used maximum likelihood-based methods in addition to Bayesian inference (25, 26, 38, 40) .",

Because Pyrc et al. generated these data by 3 alternative approaches (Bayesian, serial unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean, maximum likelihood [26] ), we used their MRCA to validate our results, and consequently prefer the MRCA dating from the exponential growth population model (as presented in Figure 3 in plain type).

The genus Rhinolophus from the sister family Rhinolophidae was found to host SARS-like viruses in several studies in China. One of our Hipposideros CoVs was in a basal phylogenetic relationship with the SARS-like clade (group 2b); their most recent common ancestors date back to \u2248400 bc. Tong et al. (17) have detected a sequence fragment of a bat CoV in Kenya that also belongs to the 2b clade but is associated with the genus Chaerephon, a free-tailed bat that is rather distantly related to the genus Hipposideros. Although these authors analyzed only a short sequence fragment, their 2b CoV seems to be related more closely to SARS CoV than the virus found in our study. In the many studies conducted in China, only closely related members of the 2b group were detected, with the most basal members dating back only to the 17th century, according to our analysis. The cooccurrence of basal and closely related viruses in Africa, as well as the existence of the same virus clade in bats other than those of the family Hipposideridae, may entail speculations about a possible origin of the SARS-like group of CoVs in Africa rather than in Asia.",

            "text": "Because H. cf. ruber bats are found only in sub-Saharan Africa and are not migratory (23) , it would be relevant to know how tightly the associated CoV is restricted to its host. Despite the statistical limitations of our rather small sample size, the absence of CoV in bats of the closely related species H. abae that were tested in our study in 2 different caves speaks in favor of tight host restriction. Another supportive argument is the absence of CoV in C. afra, a bat species sampled in sufficient numbers at the Booyem cave. This cave was coinhabited by CoV-positive H. cf. ruber bats. If tight host restriction to nonmigratory H. cf. ruber bats existed, this would indicate an origin of hCoV-229E within the geographic range of its host, i.e., the rainforest belt and the wet forested savannahs of sub-Saharan Africa (23) . Unfortunately, it will be difficult to reconstruct whether the projected host transition event might have been associated with human epidemic disease.",
