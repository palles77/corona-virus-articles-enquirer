            "text": "Varicella zoster virus (VZV) specifies several glycoproteins which are expressed on both virion and infected cell surfaces (Grose, 1980; Shemer et a& 1980; Zweerink and Neff, 1981; Shiraki et al, 1982) . Monoclonal antibodies of VZV have been produced in several laboratories and antigenic analysis of VZV has been attempted (Grose et al, 1983; Okuno et cd., 1983) . In our laboratory, three groups of monoclonal antibodies against VZV were isolated and the processing of VZV glycoproteins using these antibodies has been investigated (Okuno et a& 1983) . Recently the glycosylation of viral proteins using inhibitors of glycosylation such as tunicamycin and monensin has been studied in detail for several enveloped viruses including influenza, paramyxo viruses, vesicular stomatitis virus, Sindbis virus, retroviruses, Semliki forest virus, and herpes simplex virus (Schwarz et d, 1976; Leavitt et al, 1977; Nakamura and Compans, 1978; Diggelmann, 1979; Witte and Wirth, 1979; Johnson and Schlesinger, 1980; Pizer et ' To whom reprint requests should be addressed. Stallcup and Fields, 1981; Johnson and Spear, 1982; Nakamura et al., 1982; Wenske and Courtney, 1983) . Since the antiviral drug tunicamycin (TM) inhibits the formation of lipid-linked N-acetylglucosamine compound (Takatsuki et al, 1971 (Takatsuki et al, , 1975 and another drug monensin inhibits the glycoprotein pathway from Golgi apparatus to cell surface membrane (Tartakoff and Vassalli, 1978; Uchida et cd, 1979) , they are useful in identifying and studying the polypeptide moieties of glycoprotein. In this paper, the processing of three VZV glycoproteins (gp 2, gp 3, and gp 5) in the infected cells was investigated using TM and monensin.",

When [3Hlglucosamine was employed as a specific carbohydrate label, three bands with molecular weight of approximately '75K, 83K, and 94K which reacted with cl 9, two bands with molecular weight of 116K (faint) and 64K (major) which reacted with cl 8, and two bands with molecular weight of 94K (faint) and 55K (major) which reacted with cl 12, were observed in VZV-infected cultures (Fig. 1, lanes a, c, e) . When [3Hlglucosamine was used to label VZVinfected cells, only one diffuse band with molecular weight of 82-85K which reacted with cl 9 was observed in TM-treated cell extract (Fig. 1, lane b) . However, no polypeptide was detected in cultures reacted with cl 8 and 12 monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 1, lanes d, f) radiolabeled cells were immediately harvested or chased for 4 hr. When cl 9 antibody was used for immunoprecipitation test, radioactive bands at 65K (minor) and '75K (major) were observed in immunoprecipitates from cells labeled for 20 min (Fig. 2, lane a) . As shown in Fig. 2 lane c, these polypeptides were mainly replaced during chase by 83K and 94K molecules. In contrast, the immunoprecipitates formed with extracts of TM-treated cells gave prominent band of 73K at pulse labeling and additional 85K polypeptide during chase (Fig. 2, lanes b, d) . Next, when cell extracts were reacted with antibodies of cl 8, a band at 106K was seen at pulse labeling, and additional 116K and 64K (prominent) polypeptides were detected during chase (Fig. 2, lanes e, g) . In TM-treated cell extracts, the 102K polypeptide (faint) at pulse labeling and 56K band (major) during chase were observed (Fig. 2, lanes f, h) . Finally, when cell extracts in the absence of TM were reacted with antibody from cl 12, 49K (major) and 43K (minor) polypeptides from cell cultures of pulse labeling and 55K (major) and 94K (minor) polypeptides were observed during chase (Fig. 2, lanes i, k) . In contrast, a 39K (major) band from cell extract of pulse labeling in the presence of TM and 45K (major) and 83K (faint) polypeptides were observed during chase (Fig. 2, lanes j, 1) .",

Endo H cleaves N-linked oligosaccharides of the high-mannose type, but not the complex type (Koide and Muramatsu, 1974) . VZV-infected cells were pulse labeled with [%!l]methionine for 20 min or pulsed and chased for 4 hr as described above. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with three monoclonal antibodies and immunoprecipitates were treated or not treated with endo H. The 75K, 106K, and 49K polypeptides, which presumed to be precursor proteins of gp 2, gp 3, and gp 5, respectively, were detected in pulse-labeled cultures (Fig. 3 , lanes a, e, i) and they were replaced by the 73K, 103K, and 46K polypeptides after endo H treatment (Fig. 3, lanes b, f, j) . This evidence suggests that these precursor polypeptides were sensitive to endo H and contain high-mannose N-linked oligosaccharides. In contrast, the 83K and 94K polypeptides (gp 2) and 55K polypeptide (gp 5) which appeared during chase and are presumed to be final products were insensitive to endo H (Fig. 3, lanes  d, 1) . On the other hand, the 64K polypeptide which reacted with antibodies from cl 8 and corresponds to gp 3 was sensitive to this enzyme (Fig. 3, lane h) . This shows that among three VZV glycoproteins only gp 3 contains high-mannose type oligosaccharides.",

The clone 9 mono-clonal antibodies reacted with the 75K polypeptide (major) in the pulse labeling, and with the 83K and 94K polypeptides during chase (Fig. 2, lanes a, c) . The 73K polypeptide was detected in the TMtreated and pulse-labeled cell culture, and the additional 85K polypeptide appeared during chase (Fig. 2, lane d) . This suggests that the nascent polypeptide chain elongates and 0-glycoside oligosaccharides would be added to the polypeptides. Next, cl 8 monoclonal antibodies, which react with gp 3, immunoprecipitated the 102K polypeptide in the pulse labeling and the 56K polypeptide during chase (Fig. 2 , lane h). Since precursor polypeptide (116K) will be considered to cleave to 64K product protein and 64K polypeptide appear in the virions and on the membrane of cells (Okuno et al, 1983) , the 56K polypeptide found in TM-treated cells could be postulated to be a product protein cleaved as the case of 64K polypeptide in the absence of TM. It is reported that the cleavage of Semliki forest virus polypeptide occurs in the presence of TM (Garoff and Schwarz, 1978) . This supports that the glycosylation of gp 3 is not necessary for the cleavage of polypeptide. Finally, in the ease of gp 5, clone 12 monoclonal antibodies reacted with the 45K polypeptide (major) in the pulse labeling, and with the 55K (major) and 94K (minor) polypeptides. The 94K band was always observed in the long labeled or pulse-chased cultures . It was previously supposed that gp 5 and gp 2 glycoproteins would share some (Okuno et ah, 1983 ). The 39K polypeptide was mainly detected in the pulse labeling and the 45K polypeptide was observed during chase. Because of the data from vesicular stomatitis virus (Rothman and Lodish, 1977) , which indicate the glycosylation of polypeptide proceeds and the nascent chains are elongating, we believe that the 39K and 45K polypeptides are not normally present as precursor proteins, but the antigenic determinants are similar to the viral glycoproteins.",

The precursor polypeptides of 75K (pm 2), 106K (pgp 3), and 49K km 5) were all sensitive to endo H as shown in Fig. 3 . While product proteins, 83K and 94K (gp 2) and 55K (gp 5) were insensitive to endo H, the 64K (gp 3) was sensitive to this enzyme (Fig. 3, lane h) . This indicates that the N-linked oligosaccharide chain is present in gp 3, and gp 5 contains complex type N-linked oligosaccharide, and that O-linked and N-linked complex type of oligosaccharides exist in gp 2.",

When cell extracts from monensin-treated cells were reacted with monoclonal antibodies, no effect was observed on the synthesis of polypeptide at the pulse labeling. However, the product proteins were not detected in monensin-treated cells but fast-migrating polypeptides were observed in gp 2 and gp 5. The monensin blocks the addition of O-linked oligosaccharides to glycoprotein and also it inhibits the conversion of Nlinked high-mannose type oligosaccharide to the complex type (Johnson and Spear, 1983 ). Considering the data described above, it can be confirmed that gp 2 contains N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides and gp 5 contains complex type Nlinked oligosaccharides.",
