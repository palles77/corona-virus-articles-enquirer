Sequencing data have led to the identification of a number of large open reading frames (ORFs). ORFla and b, which account for the 5' two-thirds of the coronavirus genome, are assumed to encode nonstructural proteins including the viral replicase/transcriptase. The seven to eight remaining ORFs are expressed through a set of 3' coterminal, subgenomic size mRNAs of which only the unique region is translationally active. These include the ORFs coding for the virion structural proteins, i.e., the nucleocapsid (N) and two or three envelope glycoproteins: the spike (S) and the membrane (M) proteins, and the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) present in a coronavirus subset. These ORFs are distributed following the consensus gene order 5' Pol-(HE)-S-M-N 3'. The other ORFs are interspersed within the genome and their number and position differ among coronavirus members (reviewed by Spaan et a/., 1988; and Lai, 1990) . They have been shown to be expressed by functionally mono-, di-, or tricistronic mRNAs and were generally assumed to encode nonstructural proteins, the function of which is still unknown or conjectural.

            "text": "In TGEV genome, four such ORFs have been deduced. Two of them are expressed by the same mRNA (mRNA 3) in two out of the three virus strains sequenced (Rasschaert et a/., 1987; Kapke et a/., 1988; Britton et al., 1989; Wesley et al., 1989) . The predicted product of ORF3a is 61 to 71 codon long, with a variable C-terminal end. It appears to be dispensable for virus replication since it was found to be absent in a TGEV variant strain SP (Wesley et a/., 1990) as well as in the closely related porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) (Rasschaert eta/., 1990) . ORF3b (expressed by a separate mRNA species numbered 3-l in Miller strain) has a constant length (244 residues); however, one clone of Purdue-l 15 strain was reported to have an ORF3b which is shortened by 79 codons at the 5' end and in several cDNA clones by 67 codons at the 3' end (Rasschaert et al., 1987) . ORF4 was predicted to encode a 82 amino acid long hydrophobic polypeptide (Rasschaer-t et a/., 1987; Kapke et a/., 1988; Britton et a/., 1989; Wesley eta/., 1989) . So far, the putative products of the three above-mentioned ORFs have not been identified in infected cells. The last ORF, ORF7, is located downstream of the N gene (Kapke and Brian, 1986; Rasschaert et al., 1987; Britton et al., 1988) an unusual feature among coronaviruses. A polypeptide of M, 14K, reacting with antibodies produced against an ORF7 synthetic peptide, has been characterized in TGEV-infected cells (Garwes et al., 1989) .",

The Ndel-Sspl fragment (0.7 kbp) derived from plasmid pTG2-15 (Rasschaert et al., 1987) was digested with the Ddel restriction enzyme. Ddel-Sspl DNA fragment was repaired with the Klenow large fragment of DNA polymerase I and cloned into the BarnHI site of the pVL941 vector (Luckow and Summers, 1989) . The resulting plasmid, named pVLORF4, contained a 0.33 kbp insert. A second plasmid, pVLORF4A was constructed by inserting an ORF4 gene in which the 3' last 63 nt were deleted through PCR mutagenesis @char-f et a/., 1986) on pTG2-15 using the oligonucleotides 5' G AAGAAGGGATCCATACCTATGAC and 5' ClTA-TAGGGATCCTAAGCATG as 5' and 3' amplimers, respectively. These amplimers were designed to introduce an additional stop codon TAG at the 3'end of the gene and a BarnHI cloning site at each end. The amplification product was digested by BamHl and ligated into the pVL941 cloning site. The orientation and sequence of the ORF4 and ORF4A inserts relative to the AcNPV polyhedrin leader were determined by restriction analysis and partial DNA sequencing. In these constructs, the initiation codon of the ORF4 and ORF4A sequences were positioned at 54 and 7 bp from the BamHl cloning site, respectively.",

Furthermore, recent studies on mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), and bovine (BCV) coronaviruses have shown that the products translated from these ORFs were associated with the membrane of infected cells (Leibowitz et a/., 1988; Abraham et a/., 1990; Smith et al., 1990) , as evidenced now for TGEV ORF4. These observations prompted us to reexamine the relevant amino acid sequences for possible similarities that earlier comparative analysis by us and others failed to detect (except for the closely related MHV and BCV viruses). Figure 9 shows a tentative alignment of the ORF4-like sequences from 5 coronavirus members, which was outlined using the program MULTALIN (Corpet, 1988) and refined manually. On the basis of the deduced consensus sequence, in which 37 residues are conserved in at least 3 out of the 5 sequences aligned (87 positions), we conclude that these proteins share significant similarities. As a striking feature, a 19-20 residue-long hydrophobic stretch, followed by a cluster of 2 or 3 cysteines is present 15 to 20 residues from the N terminus The C-terminal part of the polypeptides seems to be more distantly related; in particular, IBV protein extended the consensus sequence by 14 to 28 residues, depending of the strain (see Liu et a/., 1991 for IBV ORF3C sequence data).",

Furthermore, a recombinant ORF4 protein truncated of its last 21 C-terminal amino acids was no longer recognized by any of the 5 MAbs. These results support the view that an antigenic, possibly immunodominant site is expressed in the C-subterminal part of ORF4 protein. In addition, they led us to speculate that the region of the molecule which is translocated across the membrane would correspond to its carboxy domain. Recently, a striking correlation has been reported between the transmembrane orientation of eukaryotic proteins and the disposition of charged residues surrounding the most N-terminal membranespanning sequence. It has been proposed that the difference in the charge of the 15 residues flanking the presumed anchor segment determines its orientation with the more positive portion facing the cytosol (Hartmann et a/., 1989) . Applying such a rule to TGEV ORF4 sequence gives charges of -1 and +2 for the N and C flanking segments, respectively, which predicts a Nexo-Cendo orientation, in contrast to the available experimental evidence. Thus further experiments, including the production of antibodies directed to the N-terminal part of the protein, are needed for a definite assignment of the transmembrane orientation of ORF4.",

Based on the estimated molar ratio and assuming that coronavirions bear 100 (Roseto et a/., 1982) to 200 spikes, each composed of 3 S molecules (Delmas and Laude, 1990) it can be inferred that approximately 15-30 copies of ORF4 protein are incorporated into TGEV virions (Purdue strain). Such a small number of molecules in virus particles does not seem to reflect a selective exclusion since S and ORF4 accumulated in infected cells at a ratio comparable to that found in virions (data not shown).

The influenza virus M2 protein (15K) and the alphavirus 6K protein are both acylated, Nexo-Cendo transmembrane polypeptides. M2 and 6K have been shown to represent minor structural polypeptides, with an estimated number of 40 + 25 and 24 f 4 molecules per virion, respectively (Zebedee Gaedigk-Nitschko and Schlesinger, 1990 ). M2 has been reported to form tetrameric channels within the membrane and to be a target of the antiviral drug amantadine and of the CTL response to influenza virus infection (Hay et al., 1985; Lamb et al., 1985; Surgrue and Hay, 1991) . Site-directed mutagenesis studies on Sindbis and Semliki forest viruses have demonstrated that 6K protein is dispensable for virus production but exerts a role late in the assembly, possibly during virus budding (Gaedigk-Nitschko and Schlesinger, 1990; Liljestrom et a/., 199 1). The SH protein of SV5 has been reported to be orientated in the mem-brane with its N-terminus domain exposed at the cytoplasmic face, as it might be the case for TGEV SM. Whether SH is incorporated into virions is still questioned, as well as its potential role (Hiebert eta/., 1988) . The apparent conservation of SM gene in the coronavirus genome strongly implies that its product is essential for an efficient replication of the virus. Based on its location and its low copy number in particles, we speculate that SM would more likely play a role in modulating assembly and/or release of the virion. Thus, eluci-.dating the function of the coronavirus SM protein might contribute to a better understanding of an important aspect of the biology of enveloped viruses. Finally, SM may be a potent surface antigen since murine antibodies recognized a domain of the protein possibly exposed on live infected cells. Preliminary experiments indicated that anti-SM antibodies are readily detected in the serum from infected swines. Therefore, the role of SM protein in humoral and cellular immune response to TGEV infection should be worth investigating in the future.",
