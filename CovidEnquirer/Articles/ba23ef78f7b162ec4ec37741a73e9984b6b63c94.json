This coronavirus, like influenza virus, can replicate normally in the presence of cr-amanitin in Chinese hamster ovary cells which possess a drug-resistant RNA polymerase II. These findings indicate that avian infectious bronchitis virus requires the intact cell nucleus and one or more host transcriptional functions for productive infections, Preliminary data suggest that these cellular functions involve some aspect of virus-directed RNA synthesis.",

Since it has not been firmly established whether the replication of the prototype coronavirus, avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), is restricted to cytoplasmic sites and whether productive infections with this ribovirus are regulated, in part, by unidentified host factors (McIntosh, 1974; Tyrrell et al., 1978) , we undertook the present investigation of IBV biogenesis utilizing inhibitors which compromise normal function of the host cell transcriptional apparatus. During the conduct of this work, it was recently reported that a human coronavirus is blocked for infectious virus production but not virus-directed RNA synthesis in cells treated with actinomycin D (Kennedy and Johnson-Lussenberg, 1979) . A similar observation has since been made and extended in our laboratory with IBV (Evans, Welsh, and Simpson, in preparation) . The findings presented in this report further establish that IBV replication requires active participation of the intact cell nucleus.",

Working stocks of influenza A virus (WSN strain) were prepared by allantoic infection of lo-day-old white leghorn embryonated chicken eggs. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV, Indiana strain) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) were grown in BHK-21 cells for 16 hr at 37\" using reinforced MEM (RMEM) medium (Bablanian et al., 1965) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) and 10% tryptose phosphate broth (TPB). BHK-21 (clone 13) cells obtained from the American Type Culture Collection were grown as subconfluent monolayer-s in RMEM with 10% FCS in 60-mm petri dish cultures for use in plaque assays or viral growth experiments as described below. Lines of cr-amanitin-sensitive (CHO-S) and resistant (CHO-R) Chinese hamster ovary cells that were originally isolated in the laboratory of Dr. Lou Siminovitch (Chan et al., 1972) were provided by Dr. Purnell Choppin. These lines were maintained in RMEM containing 10% FCS and supplementary proline (11.5 pg/ml).

Otsuki et al., (1979) also have found BHK-21 cells to support IBV-Beaudette replication. For plaque assays, 0.2 ml aliquots of lo-fold virus dilutions made in balanced salt solution (BSS) containing 1% gelatin (GBSS) (Schochetman et al., 1977) were inoculated into subconfluent monolayer cultures of BHK-21 cells. Virus adsorption was carried out for 60 min at room temperature. Each plate received 5-ml aliquots of Eagle's MEM containing 2% FCS, 4% TPB, and 0.6% agarose (Seakem, Rockland, Maine). Certain lots of fetal calf serum were found to contain factors inhibitory for IBV plaque production making it necessary to screen serum from commercial sources for its suitability. Plates were incubated for 4 days at 35\" in a humidified atmosphere of 8% CO,/air. Titrations of WSN virus were performed in MDCK monolayer cultures incubated for 3 days at 37\" and serum was omitted from the overlay.

Subconfluent sheets of BHK-21 cells established on the walls of glass Corex tubes (17 x 100 mm) were washed free of growth medium with BSS. Prewarmed (37\") aliquots of RMEM containing 10 pg/ml of cytochalasin B were added to tubes which were immediately centrifuged in a prewarmed (37\") rotor at 9500 g at 37\" for 30 min. After centrifugation, the drug-containing medium was replaced with regular RMEM containing 10% FCS and the cultures were held at room temperature until the cells regained an approximate normal morphology in about 30 min. Control cultures were treated similarly except that they were either not centrifuged after drug treatment or they were centrifuged without subsequent drug treatment. The degree of enucleation was estimated by staining drugtreated cultures with hematoxylin and eosin and counting the number of nucleated cells among a total of about 300 cells. The number of cells per culture was estimated by counting trypsin-dispersed cells with the aid of a hemocytometer. Treated and untreated BHK-21 cultures were infected with IBV at an input multiplicity of about 60 egg infectious units (EIU) per cell. After adsorption of virus for 30 min at 35\", the cells were washed twice with BSS before addition of RMEM containing 2% FCS and 4% TPB. Cultures were incubated at 35\" for 24 hr postadsorption.

To demonstrate more conclusively that one or more host transcriptional functions mediated by RNA polymerase II regulate IBV infections, we compared the ability of IBV to replicate in a-amanitin-resistant mutants of CHO cells in the presence and absence of drug since these cells are known to possess an a-amanitin-resistant form of this enzyme (Lobban et al., 1976) . These cells enable one to determine if the action of a-amanitin is due to a direct effect on cellular RNA polymerase II rather than a viricidal action or a secondary effect on the cells. WSN influenza virus was included as a control in these experiments since earlier studies had shown that this myxovirus can productively infect CHO-R cells in the presence of a-amanitin (Lamb and Choppin, 1977; Spooner and Barry, 1977) . The experiment summarized in Table 2 shows that IBV, like influenza virus, replicates almost equally well in untreated and a-amanitin-treated CHO-R cells, whereas both viruses are strongly inhibited in progenitor CHO-S cells in the presence of drug. It should be noted that peak yields of IBV-Beaudette from untreated CHO-S and CHO-R cells are substantially less than those obtained from the BHK-21 cell line, thus indicating their semipermissive nature for this coronavirus. Collectively, these results provide evidence that normal function of cellular RNA polymerase II is required for coronavirus replication in the cell systems examined. (1 CHO cells that are sensitive (CHO-S) or resistant (CHO-R) to the inhibitory effects of a-amanitin were infected with either IBV or influenza WSN virus at input multiplicities of 70 EIUkell (IBV) or 5 PFUkell (WSN). Infected cells were incubated for 24 hr at 37\" with RMEM medium in the presence or absence of 20 &g/ml a-amanitin after which they were assayed for plaque-forming virus in either BHK-21 cells (IBV) or MDCK cells (WSN virus).",

Cell lysates obtained by freezing-thawing were tested for virus content by plaque assay in either BHK-21 cells (IBV) (Beaudette) without impairing their capacity to replicate the cytoplasmic ribovirus VSV. It is yet to be determined whether virus-specific macromolecular synthesis occurs in IBV-infected cytoplasts in the absence of infectious virus production. Whether such activity will be detected in enucleates infected with this positive stranded coronavirus will depend on its specific mode of replication; that is, whether or not initiation of viral RNA synthesis and early processing of viral mRNA species are nucleus-dependent events. Work in progress aimed at understanding how IBV interacts with nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments during its biosynthesis hopefully will resolve this question, Second, we have shown that treatment of permissive BHK-21 cells with the potent fungal toxin cu-amanitin markedly inhibits productive infections both by IBV and WSN influenza virus. At low concentrations (-10 @g/ml), this drug is recognized to act as a relatively specific inhibitor of DNA-depend-ent RNA polymerase II, the nuclear enzyme of eucaryotic cells responsible for messenger RNA synthesis (Roeder, 1976) . A more rigorous proof for an obligatory role of RNA polymerase II in the IBV replication cycle is found in our experiments involving the cramanitin-resistant CHO-R mutant cell line that possesses an RNA polymerase II which is insensitive to this drug (Lobban et al., 1976) . We have confirmed earlier reports that influenza virus is resistant to the inhibitory effects of a-amanitin when grown in CHO-R cells (Lamb and Choppin, 19'77; Spooner and Barry, 1977) and have extended these findings to the avian coronavirus, IBV. A similar approach has recently been used by Silver et al. (1979) for implicating RNA polymerase II as an essential host factor required for poxvirus biogenesis.",

The generation of pyrimidine dimers in nucleic acid molecules by this treatment is known to block normal host DNA replication and RNA transcription, and the uv doses employed in our experiments would be expected to strongly inhibit both DNA and RNA synthesis (cf. Hruby et al., 1979) . Thus, although uv irradiation simultaneously inhibits a number of cellular biosynthetic activities, it is clear that radiationdamaged BHK-21 cells with functionally impaired nuclei are unable to support active replication of infectious IBV particles.",

It is already quite apparent, however, that these two disparate classes of animal riboviruses differ at the molecular level in their requirements for specific host factors during the viral replication cycle. We have found that inhibitors of functional cellular DNA such as actinomycin D or mito-mycin C strongly block production of infectious IBV progeny in BHK-21 cells (Evans, Welsh, and Simpson, in preparation) . Unlike influenza virus, however, the growth of IBV remains sensitive to actinomyein D relatively late in the infection, while throughout the time course this drug has no appreciable effect on virus-induced sustained uptake of radiolabeled RNA precursors. Kennedy and Johnson-Lussenburg (1979) have observed a similar effect of actinomycin D on the biogenesis of human coronavirus 2293 in L132 cells although they concluded that the drug is principally active during an early stage of the viral growth cycle. None of these experiments exclude the possibility that actinomycin D prevents the transcription of short-lived host mRNA essential for viral replication. Another possibility is that the transport of an essential RNA species from the nucleus to cytoplasmic sites of viral biosynthesis is blocked by the action of this drug (Levis and Penman, 1977) .",

            "text": "An intriguing unanswered question concerns the precise role of host RNA polymerase II in the IBV replication cycle. Specific inhibition of this enzyme in IBV-infected BHK-21 cells by cY-amanitin negates virusstimulated [3H]uridine incorporation which is normally insensitive to the inhibitory effects of actinomycin D. It should be determined whether the appearance of all normal size classes of IBV-specific RNA is prevented in these cells by cr-amanitin as a preliminary sign that the initiation and possible maintenance of viral RNA synthesis depend on the functional integrity of nuclear RNA polymerase II. For influenza virus, there is convincing evidence that this eucaryotic enzyme provides a host mRNA primer which serves to initiate viral RNA transcription in the cell nucleus (Mark et al., 1979; Plotch et al., 1979) . RNA polymerase II as a multicomponent enzyme which exists in at least three structurally distinct forms has been directly implicated in the synthesis of viral mRNAs (or their precursors) of various DNA viruses and RNA retroviruses (Roeder, 1976) . While the avian coronaviruses are credited with possessing the largest single-stranded RNA genome (Lomniczi and Kennedy, 1977) , the manner in which it is replicated is presently unknown (Robb and Bond, 1979) . One possibility is that IBV and other positive-stranded coronaviruses utilize a virus-coded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase which is a hybrid enzyme containing one or more host components including specific subunits derived from nuclear RNA polymerase II. The precedent for such multicomponent viral enzymes of mixed origin is already well documented for procaryotic species (Losik and Pero, 1976) .",
