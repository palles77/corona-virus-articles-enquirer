In this study, we tested the hypothesis that an acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia is induced by respiratory viral infections. Methods: Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from patients with an acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia was tested for viral nucleic acid using polymerase chain reaction. Results: Only 1 of the 14 patients with an acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia exhibited evidence of respiratory syncytial virus B, and 2 patients exhibited evidence of cytomegalovirus. Seven patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Conclusions: Most cases with an acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia are not caused by a viral infection.",

IIP includes the entities of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, acute interstitial pneumonia, respiratory bronchiolitisassociated interstitial lung disease, desquamative interstitial pneumonia, and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia [1] . IPF is the most common form of IIP and is diagnosed on the basis of clinical characteristics such as high-resolution chest computed tomography findings, pulmonary function tests, and physiological findings [2] . If patients with IIP do not fulfill these criteria, surgical lung biopsies are necessary to classify the IIP as a particular type. The histopathological finding termed usual interstitial pneumonia of IPF involves a heterogeneous appearance at low magnification with alternating areas of normal lung tissue, interstitial inflammation, fibrosis, and honeycomb changes [2] .",

Huie et al. reported that they performed BAL in 18 patients presenting with an acute decline in fibrotic lung disease and found that 5 patients had culture or PCR evidence of a viral infection (1 parainfluenza virus case, 2 herpes simplex virus cases, and 2 cytomegalovirus infection cases) [4] . Wootton et al. reported that BALF and serum obtained from patients with an acute IPF exacerbation were tested for viral nucleic acid using multiplex PCR, pan-viral microarray, and high throughput cDNA sequencing [10] . In that study, 19 of the 43 patients with an acute IPF exacerbation exhibited evidence of a viral infection (1 parainfluenza virus case, 1 coronavirus case, 1 herpes simplex virus case, 2 rhinovirus cases, 2 Epstein-Barr virus cases, and 12 torque teno virus cases) [10] . These results suggest that respiratory viral infections are not the main cause of an acute IPF exacerbation. RSV-B was positive in only 1 patient with an acute IPF exacerbation. Because RSV is infrequently detected in asymptomatic individuals, RSV infection is usually associated with clinical illness and should be regarded as the causative pathogen if detected in a patient with respiratory symptoms [11] . RSV is known to be a cause of an acute lower respiratory infection in young children [12] . RSV is also common in adults; however, it usually causes a mild upper respiratory tract disease [13] .",

It has been reported that increased levels of circulating proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-8, IL-9, IL-12, and IL-7 and interferon \u03b3 are present during an acute IPF exacerbation [14] . IL-1\u03b2 upregulates IL-8, which is critical for neutrophil recruitment, and the BALF of patients with an acute IPF exacerbation is characterized by neutrophilia [14] . On the other hand, in vitro studies using human bronchiolar epithelial cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells described a complex network of RSV-induced stimulation, inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines, or both. RSV infection in human bronchiolar epithelial cells leads to the production of immune cell-specific chemokines such as IL-8. Early interaction of RSV with several Toll-like receptors on dendritic cells and monocytes releases proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2 [15] . From these results, it appears that RSV infection-induced proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 recruit neutrophils and induce an acute IPF exacerbation.",

Important limitations of this study include the small number of patients and the possibility of occult viral infections. Furthermore, we performed BAL only during acute exacerbation periods. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the virus in question caused a new infection. Further prospective studies using the same patients in whom the BAL was performed on 2 occasions to evaluate stable IIP and an acute IIP exacerbation are necessary.",

This kit is able to detect 11 respiratory infection viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-A, RSV-B, human parainfluenza virus 1, human parainfluenza virus 2, human parainfluenza virus 3, human metapneumovirus, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, human adenovirus, human bocavirus, and human rhinovirus. The reaction mixture consisted of 2 \u03bcL of each RT mixture, 12.5 \u03bcL of 2\u00c2 CycleavePCR Reaction Mix containing buffer and dNTP mixture (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) and 2 \u03bcL of each primer/probe. The final volume of the mixture was adjusted to 25 \u03bcL with the addition of DNase-and RNase-free H 2 O. In addition to BALF, the reaction mixture was made using each viral positive control in the Cycleave PCR kit, with human rhinovirus cDNA obtained from a human as a positive control and distilled water as a negative control. As the first step, amplification was started at 95 1C for 10 s, followed by 40 cycles of PCR using a thermal cycler 2700 (Life Technologies, Tokyo, Japan) as follows: 95 1C for 5 s, 55 1C for 15 s, and 72 1C for 20 s.The PCR for cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA was performed at SRL (Tokyo, Japan). For positive cases, we performed CMV antigenemia while utilizing the patients' peripheral blood.",
