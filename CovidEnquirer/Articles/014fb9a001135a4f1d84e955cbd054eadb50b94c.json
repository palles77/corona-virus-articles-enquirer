Alpha-coronaviruses interfere with the type I interferon (IFN) response in various ways, ensuring the limited activation of IFN responses. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), an Alphacoronavirus genera virus, is an important pathogen that mainly infects piglet, but little is known about the activation of the host immune response. We show that TGEV induces a delayed activation of the IFN response in intestinal epithelial cells. Briefly, IFN-b expression induced by TGEV infection is delayed with respect to that induced by poly(I:C) transfection. In addition, some of the IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) were up-regulated in the early infection stage without obvious expression of IFN-b. Moreover, we show that activation of IFN responses induced by poly(I:C) could inhibit viral replication in the early infection stage, but failed in the late infection stage in IPEC-J2 cells. Finally, the activation of IFN responses induced by TGEV infection cannot inhibit viral replication. Taken together, this study provides a preliminary analysis of an interaction between TGEV and IFN-b responses of intestinal epithelial cells.",

Consequently, the secretion of IFNs induces a wide array of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) to exert antiviral effects (Wong and Chen, 2016) .

After TGEV infected at MOI of 5 for 12 h, INF-b level was around 100 relative units, while it was about 20 relative units when TGEV infected at MOI of 0.01. Morevoer, we measured the luciferase activity of IFN-b promoter after TGEV infection at MOI of 5 or 0.01 ( Fig. 1C and D) . The results were similar to the mRNA expression of IFN-b. Furthermore, IFN-b promoter activity was significantly higher after poly(I:C) transfection for 6 h in IPEC-J2 cells than that after TGEV infection at MOI of 5 (Fig. 1E ). According to the results of cell viability test (Fig. S1A ) and the induction of IFN-b expression (Fig. S1B) , the treatment of 1000 ng/ ml poly(I:C) (HMW)/LyoVec, a synthetic dsRNA polymer sensed by RIG-I/MDA-5, was set as IFN-b expression positive control. Despite of the dose of infection, the peak of IFN-b mRNA was similar to that treated with 1000 ng/ml Poly(I:C) (HMW)/LyoVec after 24 h. These data indicated that the type I IFN production was not obviously inhibited by TGEV in IPEC-J2 cells. The expression of IFN-b induced by TGEV infection was slower than that induced by poly(I:C) transfection.",

To determine if IFN-b exert antiviral activity in TGEV infection, we examined the expression of some Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). The mRNA of RIG-I (Fig. 3A) , IFIT1 (Fig. 3B) , IFIT44 (Fig. 3C ) and ISG15 (Fig. 3D) were all up-regulated after IFN-b high expression and higher than those treated with poly(I:C) (HMW)/ LyoVec, which indicated the type I IFN signal pathways were not blocked by TGEV infection. Interestingly, the mRNA of RIG-I, IFIT1 and IFIT44 were transiently up-regulated at 1 h and 6 h post TGEV infection while in the later infection stage (after 12 h at MOI = 5), the mRNAs of ISGs were limited and insufficient in the early infection stage. It might be induced through peroxisomal MAVS pathway, which is required for rapid but transient induction of antiviral ISGs independent of secreted IFNs (Dixit et al., 2010) . These results suggested that the innate antiviral immune responses could be induced by TGEV infection. The activation of IFN responses need abundant dsRNA. IPEC-J2 cells were seeded in 24-well plates, then these cells were infected with TGEV at MOI of 5 (A) or 0.01 (B) respectively, transfection with 1000 ng/ml poly(I:C) for 24 h was a positive control.

To specifically demonstrate the antiviral activity of IFN-b during TGEV infection, we tried to establish IFN-a/b receptor (IFNAR) knockout (KO) cell lines by gRNA-guided CRISPR/ Cas9 knockout strategy. Through single cell pick-up and expansion, we got several IFNAR KO ST cell lines. We also conducted the relevant experiment in IPEC-J2 cells, but did not get an IFNAR KO cell line as this cell cannot grow by single cell. To determine the efficiency of IFNAR knockout, we measured the mRNA level of IFNb and two ISGs after transfection with poly(I:C) in these IFNAR KO ST cell lines. As shown in Fig. 5 , the level of IFN-b (A) was significantly suppressed and DDX58 (B), ISG15 (C) were all completely inhibited in IFNAR2-6, 7, 9 ST cell lines. Therefore, we chose IFNAR2-6 as a successful IFNAR KO ST cell line, while the IFNAR1-3 as a plasmid transfection control. Moreover, we measured the activity of IFN-b promoter and ISRE (interferonstimulated response elements) by Luc-based reporter assays. Though, it was shown that the level of IFN-b (Fig. 5D) increases slightly induced by poly(I:C), the activity of ISRE (Fig. 5E ) was completely inhibited in IFNAR2-6 cells, which indicated IFN-I responses were blocked. We measured the titer of TGEV after infection for 12 h in IFNAR KO ST cells transfected with or without poly(I:C). As shown in Fig. 5F , the replication of TGEV in IFNAR2-6 cells was similar to that in IFNAR1-3 cells or ctrl cells and it has no difference in IFNAR2-6 cells transfected with or without poly(I:C), while poly(I:C) transfection can inhibit the replication of TGEV completely in ST ctrl cells or IFNAR1-3 cells. Therefore, we can get the conclusion directly that the antiviral activity of IFN-I during TGEV infection is limited.",

Because of various structural proteins and non-structural proteins, there are complex interactions between coronavirus and host cells especially for the innate immune response (Kindler and Thiel, 2014; Fung and Liu, 2014) . The innate immune system is the first line of defense against virus infection, especially type I interferon antiviral response. Type I interferon (IFN), often triggered by viral infection, could broadly stimulate antiviral cytokine and inflammatory cytokines expression (Katze et al., 2008) . However, induction of IFN expression is often failed in coronavirus infection (Kindler and Thiel, 2014) . Resent study about PEDV indicated that the IFN-b production was inhibited by blockage of the RIG-I-mediated pathway in porcine intestinal epithelial cells (Cao et al., 2015) . Despite the similarity in infection and pathological characteristics between PEDV and TGEV, several studies indicated TGEV infection could induce IFN-b expression (Becares et al., 2016; Cruz et al., 2013a Cruz et al., , 2011 Marquez-Jurado et al., 2015) . Our results also confirmed that TGEV infection induces type I interferon expression in the intestinal epithelial cells. Moreover, the trend of viral gRNA expression was similar with IFN-b mRNA expression (Figs. 1 A and 2 A) . The similar trend of gRNA expression and IFN-b mRNA level was also observed in ST cells infected with TGEV (Cruz et al., 2013a) . However, the abundant IFN-b was produced too late to inhibit viral replication and infection of cells.",

            "text": "This may also be the reason for the short latency and rapid development of transmissible gastroenteritis. Since the same structure of eukaryotic mRNAs, the nucleic acid of coronavirus could not be recognized by pattern recognition receptors (e.g. TLR7/8 or RIG-I/MDA5) . Moreover, Knoops and Kikkert et al. reported that ER-derived double membrane vesicles (DMVs) was the main sites for SARS-CoV replication. The viral dsRNA is mostly located in the inner lumen of DMVs (Snijder et al., 2006) , whereas RIG-I/MDA5 cannot efficiently detect it. Not only that, coronavirus encodes several ribonucleases, such as nsp14 (Becares et al., 2016; Bouvet et al., 2012) and nsp 6 (Lundin et al., 2014) that could remove the RNA-PRRs complex and blockage of RLRs signaling. Due to these strategies, coronaviruses have been shown to induce limited expression of IFN-b. Furthermore, SARScoronavirus ORF9b triggers the degradation of MAVS/TRAF3/TRAF6 signalosome and limits host cell IFN responses (Shi et al., 2014) . In addition, nsp5, which encodes the 3C-like protease of PEDV, disrupts type I IFN signaling by cleaving NEMO (Wang et al., 2016) . In agreement with current knowledge, TGEV is just less efficient than other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, antagonizing the host cell innate immune response. However, it is still confusing that the expression of IFN-b was paralleled with the increase of viral RNA during the peak of viral nucleic acid replication. However, the invasion of TGEV could not induce efficient type I IFN expression in the early infection stage.",

We can observe several ISGs increase in the early infection stage (Fig. 3) . It might be the reason that peroxisomal (RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) adaptor protein) MAVS induces the rapid interferon-independent expression of defense factors that provide short-term protection (Dixit et al., 2010) . However, pre-treatment with poly(I:C) could decrease the expression of gRNA ( Fig. 4A and B) , inhibit the level of N protein after TGEV infection 12 h (Fig. 4C) and suppress the level of viral titer (Fig. 4E) . It is surprising that the adequate IFN-b and ISGs transcription could not suppress viral replication in the late , ISG15 (C) were shown. IFNAR KO ST cell lines seeded in 24-well plate were co-transfected with pRL-TK plasmid and the IFN-b promoter luciferase reporter plasmid (D) or pISRE-TA-Luc (E) for 24 h, then these cells were transfected with poly(I:C) or not. Cells were harvested and luciferase activity was analyzed using a dual-luciferase assay. (F) IFNAR KO ST cell lines were transfected with poly(I:C) or not for 24 h, then these cells were infected with TGEV at MOI of 0.01 for 12 h. The cell culture supernatants were harvested post-infection at indicated times and assayed for the production of infectious virus by TCID50 assay on ST cells. The data represent the mean AE SD of three independent experiments. One-way ANOVA; *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01. infection stage (Fig. 4) . We know very little about the interaction between TGEV infection and the host innate responses although it was reported that TGEV nsp14 and accessory gene 7 had the ability to modulate the innate immune response (Becares et al., 2016; Cruz et al., 2013a) . Currently, we could only speculate about the cause of this effect. It appears that some structural or nonstructural protein of TGEV were highly expressed in the late infection stage, which blocked type I IFN signal, resulting in loss of antiviral activity. Moreover, in the later phase of TGEV infection, massive IFN-b expression of intestinal epithelial cells could not only fail to inhibit the viral transmission but also induce immunosuppressive molecules (McNab et al., 2015) or damage the host (Sadler and Williams, 2008; Chawla-Sarkar et al., 2003) , which is not conducive to the host against virus infection.",
