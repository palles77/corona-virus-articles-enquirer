More than one-quarter of responding HCP (27.6%) had influenza-like illness (ILI) during the outbreak. The estimated infection rate of pandemic H1N1 2009 was 9.1% in the study of HCP. Independent risk factors for ILI were female gender, <40 years of age, the presence of chronic diseases associated with influenza complications, having family members with ILI or pandemic H1N1 2009, and working in influenza outpatient, influenza inpatient, non-influenza outpatient or emergency departments. During the outbreak of pandemic H1N1 2009, HCP frequently had ILI or the influenza infection. The development of the influenza infection in HCP was associated with some of their baseline characteristics, occupational risk factors, and non-occupational ones during the outbreak.",

It may also disrupt appropriate healthcare services during the outbreak and result in significant morbidity and mortality among patients with chronic cardiopulmonary disease, immunosuppression or those belonging to either age extreme. 8e10 To engineer effective means of controlling influenza transmission in a healthcare setting, we need more information regarding the characteristics of influenza outbreaks among HCP. Recently, there have been several investigations describing clinical characteristics of HCP with pandemic H1N1 2009. 1e7 However, the majority of these studies were conducted in single centers or included only HCP who developed pandemic H1N1 2009. Consequently, they may have a limited ability to explain the general features of the outbreaks or to investigate risk factors for the influenza infection among HCP. Therefore, we performed a multicenter survey of all HCP who had been on duty during the outbreak.",

Regarding the incidence of pandemic H1N1 2009 among HCP, there have been no reports except a few seroepidemiological studies. 2,3 One study from Taiwan reported a seropositive rate of H1N1 antibodies to be 20% among HCP. 3 In one large Singapore center designated for outbreak management, seroconversion was observed in 7% of HCP. 2 The direct comparison of the infection rates between the hospitals of the previous studies and our institutions may not be plausible due to the different study designs and case definitions. However, the estimated rate of this study (9.1%) simply suggest that influenza infection may be considerable among HCP during an influenza pandemic, with the data from several large centers rather than those of single centers. In addition, it suggests that a large number of infected HCP might be unrecognized or untested during the pandemic, because only 4.2% (141/3365) was reported to have the infection in the study hospitals.

This association may be due to the relative lack of preexisting immunity to this novel influenza virus among younger age groups, 13 and the lack of local or general immunity associated with chronic diseases. However, the higher susceptibility in female HCP in this study may not be easily understood. One possible explanation is that this is due to women being caregivers in the household setting and, therefore, more likely to be infected from the household. Unfortunately, we did not make inquiries about the presence or absence of children for all female Table 3 . A recent review has reported a higher incidence of pandemic H1N1 2009 infection in young women than young men of compatible age, although the exact causes have not been suggested. 14 More data may be needed for higher susceptibility to influenza infection in female HCP. HCP who worked at influenza outpatient and emergency departments had the highest risk for ILI. It has been previously suggested that much of the risk for infection to HCP during an outbreak likely exists in an outpatient setting. 1 Additionally, in Korean general hospitals, a huge number of outpatient visits took place only for the confirmatory diagnostic tests for pandemic H1N1 2009, maybe from the pervasive anxiety over fatality potential of the infection. At least in part, it may increase the risk for pandemic H1N1 2009 among HCP working in outpatient settings rather than those in inpatient ones. HCP working in the non-influenza outpatient department were also at risk for ILI. This may be due to the variable presentation of influenza infection. 15 A substantial number of patients with atypical or mild symptoms, especially pediatric patients, frequently visited the non-influenza outpatient department.",

            "text": "This study showed that household members may transmit pandemic H1N1 2009 to HCP or vice versa. HCP whose household members had ILI or pandemic H1N1 2009 were more frequently infected than were those whose household members were ILI or pandemic H1N1 2009 negative. A seroepidemiological study from Singapore reported that having a child with ILI was a non-occupational risk factor for HCP seroconversion. However, whether transmission of the infection occurred from the child to HCP or vice versa was not clear in the study. 2 Our data suggest that HCP who are involved directly in patient care may transmit pandemic H1N1 2009 to their household members, whereas those who are not involved in patient care are more likely to transmit the infection from their homes to their hospitals. These findings may indicate that variable infection control measures should be implemented for HCP who are actively involved in influenza patient care in order to prevent transmission from hospital to household. Additionally, control of influenza among children or adolescents may lead to the reduction of influenza infection in hospitals as well as in the community.",

            "text": "This study has several important limitations. First, the proportion of HCP not reporting the receipt of diagnostic tests was substantial. Therefore, the total number of pandemic H1N1 2009 among HCP may be underreported. This, in turn, might limit the power of the data to identify meaningful risk factors. Instead, we used ILI to identify risk factors for influenza infection in HCP. However, the ILI case definition of self-reported fever with respiratory illness was not highly specific for the diagnosis of pandemic H1N1 2009. Any non-pandemic H1N1 illness classified as ILI might result in a bias in this study. The laboratory surveillance data from the Korean government reported that rhinovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus and respiratory syncytial virus cocirculated in the community during the influenza pandemic. 16 However, even with this bias prone to nullify any remarkable differences in infected HCP, the identified risk factors for ILI of this study were similar to those for pandemic H1N1 2009 identified in other studies. 2, 3, 5 Second, the impact of recall bias may be considerable due to the study design, especially on the source of infection, the compliance to the isolation precautions, and the direction of transmission between HCP and their family members. Third, working at pediatric wards or clinics may be an important risk factor for the infection, but the data could not be collected mainly due to unseparated wards or clinics in the study hospitals. Fourth, we presented the crude odds of seasonal or pandemic vaccination for the development of ILI in Table 1 . However, influenza vaccination only started in late October 2009 (just before the peak of the pandemic) in Korea and we could not collect information on the onset of ILI and the date of vaccination among HCP from the study design. Consequently, we could not determine the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in this study. The receipt of vaccination was excluded in the multivariate analysis. Fifth, we did not present the variation in the characteristics of the outbeak by the study hospital. We calculated the infection rate of each hospital as described in Fig. 1 . The infection rate was as follows: hospital A, 14.2%; hospital B, 9.9%; hospital C, 6.9%; hospital D, 3.4%. We compared the characteristics of HCP in the study hospitals with lower infection rates (hospital A and B), with those in the study hospitals with higher infection rates (hospital C and D). However, the comparison did not show any differences in the preventive measures or systems unique to each study hospital, except some differences in demographic data of participating HCP between the study hospitals. In addition, the estimated rate may be less reliable due to the quartered number of the study HCP. Therefore, these data were not presented here.",
