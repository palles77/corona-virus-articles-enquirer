The most notable are inhibition of quorum sensing (through MTAN) and anticancer activity (through MTAP and PNP). 4, 6, 7 Other noteworthy effects include antiparasitic and antibacterial activity. 8e10 Immucillin A (1), also shows broad-spectrum antiviral activity (Fig. 1) .

            "text": "The synthesis of azanucleosides is not trivial. The core iminosugar often requires a long multi-step synthesis, and attachment of the nucleobase poses a second challenge, due to the unstable hemiaminal linkage that would hydrolyze spontaneously upon contact with water. Several strategies have been investigated to overcome this liability. Apart from synthesizing C-nucleosides, where most of the research has been focusing on, enhanced stability can also be obtained by substituting the nitrogen. Chiacchio et al., for example, reported an N-Boc-protected 3'-deoxyazaribonucleoside that displays highly potent anti-HCV activity in a replicon assay. 14 A third strategy is the synthesis of N-homoazanucleosides, in which a methylene linker is inserted between the carbohydrate mimic and the base. Although this formal insertion of a CH 2 unit in the glycosidic bond lengthens the separation between the base and the pyrrolidine ring relative to that in the natural substrate, this bond is likewise elongated in transition states. 1'-homoaza-adenosine 3 is an inhibitor of protozoan nucleoside hydrolases, although less potent than the corresponding C-nucleoside. 15, 16 Furthermore, several second-generation Immucillins, for example the femtomolar MTAP/MTAN inhibitor 2, also possess an extra methylene linker between the pyrrolidine and the surrogate nucleobase. 17e19 In addition, homonucleosides are resistant towards nucleases, may still be phosphorylated by cellular enzymes and are able to pair with natural nucleosides through Watson-Crick interactions. 20 1 0 -Homonucleosides were recently reviewed by Wr oblewski et al. 21 In this work we report the synthesis of a series of 2'-homoazanucleosides, regioisomers of the 1'-homoazanucleosides (e.g. 3) , in which the nucleobase is attached to the 2'-position of the pyrrolidine ring via a methylene linker. This transposition of the nucleobase affords analogues with the same number of bonds between the nucleobase and carbons 2 0 , 3 0 and 4 0 of the pyrrolidine ring as in the natural nucleosides and therefore might more closely mimic the spatial arrangements of natural nucleosides. A series of 2'-homo-azanucleosides was synthesized containing the natural and some closely related nucleobases, as well as two 5'-thio analogues, inspired by the potent methylthioadenosine-mimicking aza-C-nucleosides (e.g. 2).",

The chloride was substituted for a hydroxy function during the BCl 3 -mediated deprotection, by dropwise quenching with MeOH at low temperature. Substitution can be avoided by adding Et 3 N prior to quenching with MeOH. 33 Mitsunobu reaction of 23 with 7-deaza-6-chloropurine to synthesize 34 was not possible due to the less acidic pyrrole NH. Hence, 23 was first mesylated and then substituted in a classical S N 2 fashion, to afford 34. The chloride was then substituted with NaN 3 . Reduction of the azide and simultaneous removal of the 5 0 -Obenzyl with Pd(OH) 2 and H 2, followed by acidic hydrolysis of the remaining protecting groups afforded 7-deazadenine analogue 35. 5-Fluorouracil was introduced as its N-3-benzoyl protected derivative. 34 Deprotection of 36 was realized in 2 steps: first basic removal of the benzoyl group, then treatment with BCl 3 .
