In adults, the influenza A viruses cause the major number of serious nonbacterial respiratory infections of the upper and lower tract. Deaths from influenza A virus infections in the United States number several thousand each year. Other myxoviruses, especially respiratory syncytial virus and the parainfluenza viruses, cause serious respiratory tract disease in infants and children, especially in infants under 1 year of age, but deaths from these infections are very few. In adults, these myxoviruses account for fewer infections, and they are less severe. A number of other virus groups cause acute respiratory tract infections in adults and children, including adenoviruses, coronaviruses and picornaviruses (enteroviruses and rhinovi- pneumonia with a clinical presentation not unlike a viral or mycoplasma pneumonia, they are not generally grouped with the common nonbacterial respiratory infections, and are not discussed further. ruses), but these do so less frequently and usually with less severity than the myxoviruses~ One mycoplasma species of man, Mycoplasmapnettmoniae (previously designated the \"agent of cold agglutinin-positive primary atypical pneumonia\" or the Eaton agent), causes upper and lower respiratory tract infections. Mainly it has been implicated in cold agglutinin-positive primary atypical pneumonia, but it also causes bullous myringitis and undifferentiated febrile upper respiratory tract disease. Although occurring in all age groups, Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections predominate in young adults. Importantly, these infections can be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, mainly tetracycline or erythromycin, and for this reason should be differentiated from the viral infections. Rickettsiae and chlamydia organisms also cause pneumonia. These infections are not as common as virus and mycoplasma infections and they are more'likely to be suspected in specific epidemiologic instances. Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) and Chlamydia psittaci (psittacosis) infections also can be treated effectively with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and their early diagnosis demands prompt and appropriate antibiotic treatment. Tetracycline is the usual drug of choice for infections caused by these agents.",

With the introduction of new laboratory procedures, at this time available mainly in research laboratories, the diagnosis of nonbacterial respiratory infections can be accomplished more rapidly and with a greater degree of certainty than before (Table 5) .

However, Q fever and psittacosis infections are infrequent. Among the viruses of major importance in producing acute lower respiratory tract disease are the parainfluenza viruses, especially parainfluenza types 1 and 3, respiratory syncytial virus, adenoviruses, influenza A virus and coronaviruses. The parainfluenza viruses occur endemically and are associated with serious infections throughout the year (see Table 3 ). Outbreaks of respiratory syncytial virus occur annually sometime between December and April and produce widespread infection of susceptible infants and children under 1 year of age. Influenza A virus infections occur epidemically every 2-3 years and, although they produce serious lower respiratory tract infections in children, the pneumonia rates in children for these infections are lower than in the adult. Influenza viruses also cause bronchiolitis, laryngotracheobronchitis and acute bronchitis.

A croupette or therapy with cool humidity oxygen mist is invaluable in relieving dyspnea, stridor and hypoxia. Atropine should not be given. Mild sedation may be beneficial (chloral hydrate 10-15 mg/kg every 6-8 hours) but care should be exercised in its administration. Ampicillin 200-300 mg/kg intravenously per day is indicated with epiglottitis or when secondary infection is suspected. Intermittent positive-pressure breathing (IPPB) treatments with aerosolized racemic epinephrine (Vaponefrin) (2.5%) diluted in normal saline and repeated every 30 minutes may be of great benefit. Tracheostomy may be lifesaving in croup with epiglottitis. In controlled studies, steroids have not been shown to be effective in relieving distress in viral croup, although they are used widely.",

Psittacosis pneumonia persists for between I and 3 weeks. The treatment of choice is tetracycline, 2-4 gm daily in divided doses administered until 1 week after abatement of the illness. During convalescence, specific complement-fixing antibodies develop to Chlamydia psittaci, and fourfold or greater rises in antibody are diagnostic of this infection (see Table 5 ). A presumptive specific diagnosis can be made when only a single serum is available by detection of a titer of 1 : 16 or greater. Although the organism can be isolated from the sputum or blood during the acute phase of illness, this agent can easily be transmitted to laboratory workers unless rigid containment procedures are used. In the routine diagnostic examination of nonbacterial pneumonia, attempts to isolate Chlamydia psittaci, especially by inexperienced personnel, are'unwarranted.",

            "text": "The major defense mechanism in nonbacterial infections is the IgA secretory antibody system. IgA, one of four major proteins found in nasal secretions, along with albumin, small amounts of IgG (gamma globulin)and siderophilin, is the most significant component of nasal secretions and primarily functions in local immunity. Secretory IgA has a sedimentation coefficient of 11S and additional antigenic characteristics that differentiate it from circulating (serum) IgA, which is 7S. Structurally, secretory IgA is composed of 4 H chains and 4 L chains plus a unique component designated as transport piece. The transport piece plays a role in the passage of IgA through cells to their surfaces, where the secretory IgA can act. Secretory IgA is found in the secretions from the upper and lower respiratory tract, parotid saliva, colostrum and tears. The defense function of secretory IgA is suggested by its major production following topical immunization (intranasal or pharyngeal instillation) of antigen. In contrast, little or no response in secretory IgA antibody occurs in response to immunization by the systemic route. Most lgA appearing in the respiratory tract secretions is synthesized locally by plasma cells in the adjacent tissues. Diminished host resistance may be related to a selective IgA deficiency; affected patients may have recurrent lower respiratory tract infections, allergic syndromes or an autoimmune disorder, or may appear to be healthy adults. A combined deficiency in IgA and cell-mediated immunity contributes to the development of severe respiratory tract infections. Hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy is a self-limited disor-der characterized by delayed maturation of IgG synthesis. After the normal decline in transplacental antibodies during the first months of life there is a significant delay in gamma globulin synthesis. Usually, normal levels of immunoglobulins are attained by 2-4 years of age. Respiratory tract infections are common during this period and immunoglobulin levels are low, usually below 400 rag/100 ml. Gamma globulin may be given to affected infants with severe symptoms, which, in addition to recurrent respiratory illness, include failure to thrive and intermittent diarrhea.",

In general, the recognition of hypogammaglobulinemia in children is signaled by total immunoglobulin levels less than 400 mg/100 ml or IgG levels less than 200 mg/100 ml.",

In the absence of the availability of a test to determine specific Mycoplasma pnettmoniae antibody, the demonstration of high titers of cold agglutinins provides strong presumptive evidence of infection with My-coplasma pneumoniae and :justifies the initiation of proper antibiotic treatment. Cold agglutinins (globulins of the IgM Class) formed during Mycoplasma pneunzoniae infections have anti-I specificity for I-positive erythrocytes, perhaps because this organism contains antigens that cross react with erythrocytes. Some patients with high levels of cold agglutinins develop hemolysis and anemia during the course of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia. Prompt administration of antibiotics will effectively treat the pneumonia and should result in reversal of the anemia.",
