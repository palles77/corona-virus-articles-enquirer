In this study, we have identified a novel HLA-A*0201 restricted epitope, N220 (LALLLLDRL), of the SARS-CoV N-protein through bioinformatics analysis. The N-protein peptide N220 shows a high binding affinity towards human MHC class I in T2-cells, and is capable of activating cytotoxic T-cells in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The application of using the N220 peptide sequence with a single-chain-trimer (SCT) approach to produce a potential DNA vaccine candidate was investigated in HLA-A2.1K b transgenic mice. Cytotoxicity assay clearly showed that the T-cells obtained from the vaccinated animals were able to kill the N-protein expressing cells with a cytotoxicity level of 86% in an effector cells/target cells ratio of 81:1 one week after the last vaccination, which is significantly higher than other N-protein peptides previously described. The novel immunogenic N-protein peptide revealed in the present study provides valuable information for therapeutic SARS vaccine design.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a novel coronavirus known as SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the investigation of the SARS-CoV immunity has garnered significant attention since the worldwide outbreak spreaded to 30 countries in 2003 [1] [2] [3] . The SARS-CoV is an enveloped positive-stranded RNA virus encoding four major structural proteins, known as a spike glycoprotein (S), a small envelope protein (E), an integral membrane glycoprotein (M), and a nucleocapsid RNA-binding protein (N) [4] . Upon viral infection, the viral proteins expressed within the infected cells are degraded in the cytosol by proteasomes. Peptides generated by the proteasomes are transported by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) into the lumen of endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where an ER aminopeptidase produces the mature MHC class I-peptide complex by trimming the peptide to eight or nine amino acids [5] . The resulting MHC class I-peptide complex expressed on the surface of professional antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, plays important roles in the activation of specific cytotoxic T-cells for infected cell killing. On the other hand, the MHC class I-peptide complexes expressed on the virus infected cells is a \"marker\" for being killed. Therefore, formation of stable MHC class I-peptide complexes is critical to elicit cytotoxic T-cell response to eliminate the infected cells. Immunogenicity of a peptide sequence for the cytotoxic T-cell is determined by its binding affinity towards the human MHC class I molecule and its availability upon proteasome digestion of the parental protein. Subunit vaccines containing HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides is highly effective for the induction of strong cytotoxic T-cell response against infectious virus [6] . Among the four structure proteins of the SARS-CoV, the S and N proteins are the major targets for vaccine research studies due to their potency in triggering immune responses [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . The S protein contains 1256 amino acids and is involved in viral entry through 0264-410X/$ -see front matter \u00a9 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor on host cell surface [15, 16] and the N protein contains 422 amino acids and is involved in the viral RNA packaging [17, 18] . Previous studies suggested that HLA-A*0201 restricted SARS S and N protein peptides can trigger specific human cytotoxic Tcell response against SARS in vitro [12, 14] . In the present study, we have identified a noval HLA-A*0201 restricted Nprotein peptide (N220: LALLLLDRL). The binding affinity of the N220 peptide towards human MHC class I molecule is comparable to the N223 peptide and is higher than the N227 and N317 peptides previously described [12] . Moreover, in order to stablize the MHC class I-peptide complex for antigen presentation, the N220 sequence was genetically linked to the cDNA of human \u2424 2 -microglobulin and the alpha-1 and alpha-2 domains of the human MHC class I heavy chain to form a single-chain-trimer (SCT) in our DNA vaccine design. The SCT approach makes the MHC class I molecules less dependent on chaperone assistance for peptide loading and hence a stable MHC class I-peptide complex for antigen presentation is produced [19] [20] [21] . The potency of the N220 DNA vaccine to trigger cytotoxic T-cell response against N-protein expressing cells was demonstrated in a HLA-A2.1K b transgenic mouse model and our results indicated that the SARS protein N220 peptide is a good vaccine candidate for SARS vaccine development.",

Seven high score peptides were selected (Table 1 ) and the binding activity of these peptides towards the human MHC class I molecules was investigated by comparison of their ability to stabilize the empty MHC class I molecules expressed on the cell surface in the presence of \u2424 2 -microglobulin. The presence of the stable MHC class I-peptide complex was then detected by the antibody (BB7.2) through FACS. The results clearly show that among the seven N-protein peptides, N220 and N223 display the highest binding affinity towards the human MHC class I and the resulting fluorescence intensities are higher than the positive control flu M1 peptide (58-66, GILGFVFTL) [28] ( Fig. 1) , suggesting a high binding affinity of the N220 and N223 peptides towards the human MHC class I. The T-cell immunogenicity of the seven selected peptides was further tested by their ability to stimulate human CD8+ T cells isolated from healthy donor PBMCs. The purified CD8+ T-cells were primed three times with autologous mature peptide-loaded dendritic cells and the level of Tcell activation was then investigated by the release of IFN-\u2425 through IFN-\u2425-ELISPOT in the presence of autologous Bcells loaded with the recombinant N-protein. If the target peptide of the N-protein can be generated and presented by the target cells, the primed CD8+ T-cells could specifically recognize the peptide-MHC complex and release IFN-\u2425. The ELISPOT results show that T-cells primed with N223 (LLL-DRLNQL) and N220 (LALLLLDRL) produce the highest number of spots that are six to seven times higher than that found in the irrelevant flu peptide primed T-cells and is significantly higher than that of the other selected N-protein peptides (Fig. 2) .

The objective of this study is to identify immunogenic N-protein peptides that can serve as cytotoxic T-cell epitope in SARS vaccine. A peptide sequence useful for inducing the cytotoxic T-cell response should be presented as endogenous peptide epitope through proteasome digestion and have a high binding affinity towards the human MHC class I molecules. In contrast to the conventional method of screening numerous amino acid sequences manually from synthetic peptide library that is costly and time consuming, bioinformatics analysis was employed to search for the most immunogenic peptide sequences of the SARS N-protein. Although the efficiency of the bioinformatics analysis in searching the immunogenic peptide is high, discrepant results could also be obtained from different programs online. For instance, although the novel immunogenic N220 peptide revealed in the present study is the third potent peptide found in the SYFPETITHI program, it is ranked 13 according to the HLA peptide motif search provided by the National Institutes of Health and was totally ignored in the previous study about searching the T-cell epitopes in the N-protein [12] . To investigate whether the peptide predicted from the computer program has a high binding affinity to human MHC, a T2-cell binding assay was conduced that is based on the binding affinity of the peptide to the empty MHC class I molecules on the cell surface and to stabilize the MHC class I-peptide complex formed. The results clearly show that the novel peptide, N220, identified in the present study has a high binding affinity towards the human MHC class I molecule HLA-A2.1 that is comparable to the N223 peptide and is significantly higher than that of the N227 and N317 peptides previously described [12] . Previous studies suggested that a peptide sequence with a high binding affinity to HLA-A2.1 is not able to trigger T-cell response if the peptide sequence is not generated from endogenous process through the proteasome system. For instance, although the NY-ESO-1 peptide 159-167 has a high affinity towards the HLA-A2 molecules, it is not able to elicit cytotoxic T-cell response since the peptide is not processed naturally from the parental NY-ESO-1 protein by the proteasome [21, 31, 32] . To address the question concerning with intracellular protein processing, a T-cell activation assay with N-protein loaded B-cells, which is able to cross-present protein antigen through the proteasome system was preformed [33, 34] . The T-cell activation assay demonstrated that when the N-protein loaded B-cells were used as target cells, the N220 primed T-cells were induced for IFN-\u2425 production and the level of IFN-\u2425 produced is comparable to the N223 peptide and is significantly higher than that of the N227 and N317 peptides previously described [12] , that is consistent to the results obtained in the T2-cell binding assay.",

In the present study, the potency of the novel N220 peptide together with the three previously described peptides [12] , vaccine was investigated in a transgenic mouse model expressing the human HLA-A2.1. In contrast to the conventional method using expensive synthetic peptides for injection [14] that is infeasible for practical used in a large vaccination program, a SCT display DNA vaccine mechanism was employed. A DNA vaccine is much less costly compared to the synthetic peptides and when couple with the SCT display system, the immunogenic peptide is translated together with the \u2424 2 -microglobulin and the MHC class I heavy chain molecule as a complex. After translation, the whole covalently linked MHC class I-peptide complex can be transferred from the ER to the cell surface for antigen presentation. The high stability of the covalently linked MHC class I-peptide complex produced the SCT system excludes competing peptides and is a potent stimulator for T-cells [25] . Thus, it eliminates the uncertainty of the antigen processing in the professional antigen presenting cells and the cytotoxic T-cells can be primed more directly to ensure that the peptide encoded in the vaccine can be presented for vaccination. In our study, the DNA vaccine was injected into the transgenic mice for vaccination and the cytotoxicity assay demonstrated that vaccination of the N220 peptide is able to trigger the cytotoxic T-cell response against the N-protein expressing cells as early as 1 week after the last vaccination even in the absence of any adjuvants. Comparative results obtained from cytotoxicity assay among the tested peptides indicated that the N220 peptide represents as one of the most potent amino acid sequences of the N-protein that is able to trigger the cytotoxic T-cell response. Interestingly, all the reported immunogenic T-cell epitopes of N-protein, including the N220 revealed in the present study, are mostly clustered between the amino acid residues 220 and 362. Therefore it will be interested to investigate whether a vaccine composed of this 140 amino acid peptide (N220 to N362) coupled with the known SARS B-cell epitopes previously described [9, 35] is sufficient to trigger a protective immune response against the SARS-CoV in human.",
