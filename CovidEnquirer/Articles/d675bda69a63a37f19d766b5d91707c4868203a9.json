Genotype C and T were first suggested at the end of May 2003 (Li et al., 2003) , and were further improved and named as the Yexin genotype and Xiaohong genotype (Wang et al., 2004) . SARS virus was supposed to be transmitted from the wild animal to human being. This hypothesis was then supported by identification of a SARS-CoV-like virus in wild animals, such as palm civet, sold in markets in south China, for it had more than 99% of sequence identity to the SARS-CoV (Guan et al., 2003) , and indicating that the virus could have recently transferred its hosts, from animals to human beings. However, recent reports indicated that SARS-CoV was distinct from the virus in palm civet and no direct evidence so far to demonstrate if the palm civet virus was the origin of the SARS-CoV or if palm civets were also infected from other species (Stadler et al., 2003) . Although unlikely, the possibility that humans infected these SARS-CoV positive animals cannot be formally excluded, and there was a report of SARS-CoV transmitted from human to pig (Chen et al., 2005) . Where is the SARS-CoV-like virus of palm civet www.elsevier.com/locate/vetmic Veterinary Microbiology 120 (2007) [167] [168] [169] [170] [171] [172] in the chain?

Their conclusion was cited by lately reports (Song et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2004) . Here, our opinion, the phylogenetic relationship should be cautiously interpreted. Fig. 2 . Other model phylogenetic trees of the spike protein gene sequences, Bayesian inference (Bayes) tree was conducted with MrBayes 3.1.2 using the GTR model with 60,000 generations, sampling trees every 10th generation, and calculating a consensus tree with 25% alltrees, branch lengths indicating gamma-distributed rate variation across sites and a proportion of invariable sites, the probability of the partition indicated by the branch. Maximum likelihood (ML) tree was tested by the program MODELTEST 3.7 (Posada and Crandall, 1998) to find out the best model and In this context, as a reasonable judgment based on phylogenetic relationship and sequence variations it is likely that the recent human SARS-CoV isolate is closer to an unknown SARS-CoV predecessor than the SARS-CoVs from human or SARS-CoV-like viruses from palm civet both detected in the previous epidemic.
