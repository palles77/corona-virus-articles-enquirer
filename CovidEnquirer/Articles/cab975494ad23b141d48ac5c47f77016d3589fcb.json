However, since the emergence of NA inhibitor-resistant viruses may compromise the clinical utility of this class of anti-influenza agents, it is very important to develop new anti-influenza agents which target a different region in NA responsible for its sensitivity from that for NA inhibitors and could be used to treat NA inhibitorsresistant isolates. The oligodeoxynucleotide D35, multimerized and aggregated, suppressed replication of influenza A viruses except A/WSN/33 (WSN). The suppressive viral replication by D35 depended on Gterad and multimer formation. The range of the suppressive viral replication at the late stage, including virus assembly and release from infected cells, was much larger than that at the initial stage, viral attachment and entry. D35 suppressed NA activity of influenza A viruses. Furthermore, replacing the NA gene of A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8), in which viral replication was inhibited by D35 at the late stage, with the NA gene from WSN, in which viral replication was not inhibited, eliminated the D35-dependent suppression. D35 showed an additive anti-influenza effect with oseltamivir. It was also effective in vivo. These results suggest that the influenza virus NA mainly contributse to the D35-suppressible virus release from infected cells at the late stage. In addition, because administration of D35 into the virus-infected mice suppressed viral replication and weight loss, clinical application of D35 could be considered.",

During this period, the pandemic can spread, infect humans and cause great damage to the economy (Neumann et al., 2009) . In this lag phase, taking antiviral drugs is the only available approach to control and treat the influenza virus infections.

The mechanisms of inhibition of virus replication by polyanions are attributed to inhibition of virus adsorption to the cell membranes and/or virus envelope fusion with the endosomal membranes (Mitsuya et al., 1988; Arnberg et al., 2002; Luscher-Mattli et al., 1993) . On influenza virus, several studies have demonstrated that the suppression of viral replication by DS is caused inhibition of hemagglutinin (HA) activity, which plays a role in viral fusion process at the early stage of infection (Luscher-Mattli and Gluck, 1990; Ramalho-Santos and de Lima, 2001) . Recently we reported that DS also suppressed the NA activity and release from infected cells at the late stage of the replication, resulting in the suppressive viral replication (Yamada et al., 2012) . Since DS is negatively charged, the change in the viral surface from a positive to negative charge by adding DS may play a role in the suppression of viral replication (Moulard et al., 2000; Yamada et al., 2014) .",

The resulting innate immune response limits the early spread of infectious organisms, while promoting the development of adaptive immunity. Optimal sequences for the activation of TLR9 vary among species (Bauer et al., 2001) . There are at least four types of CpG ODNs, each of which has a different backbone, sequence, and immunostimulatory properties (Vollmer and Krieg, 2009 ). D-type (also called A) CpG ODNs typically comprise one palindromic CpG motif with a phosphodiester (PO) backbone and phosphorothioate (PS) poly(G) tail to increase resistance to nucleases, and activates plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) to produce a large amount of interferon (IFN)-a but fails to induce pDC maturation and B-cell activation (Krug 2001 , Verthelyi et al., 2001 . The three other types of ODNs consist of a PS backbone. K-type (also called B) CpG ODNs contain nonpalindromic multiple CpG motifs, and strongly activates B cells to produce interleukin (IL)-6 and pDCs to maturation but barely produces IFN-a (Hartmann and Krieg, 2000; Verthelyi et al., 2001) . C and P-type CpG ODNs contain one and two palindromic CpG sequences, respectively, both of which can activate B cells like K-type and pDC like D-type, although C CpG ODN induces weaker IFN-a production compared with P-type CpG ODN (Hartmann and Krieg, 2000; Marshall et al., 2003 , Samulowitz et al., 2010 . D-type CpG ODNs are characterized by having a core sequence with a single palindromic purine-pyrimidine-CpG-purinepyrimidine motif flanked on both sides by 3e5 selfcomplementary bases on a PO backbone. Such a structure renders the sequence flexible allowing for the formation of a stemeloop conformation and/or forming dimers with other D-type ODN molecules (Verthelyi et al., 2001) . In addition, D-type ODNs have a 3 0 end poly(G) motif (Verthelyi et al., 2001) , which is known to selfassociate via Hoogsteen base-pairing to form parallel quadruplex structures called G-tetrads (Panyutin et al., 1990; Costa et al., 2004) .",

Influenza virus strain H1N1 PR8 or H3N2 Panama was inoculated onto MDCK cells, and after 1-h incubation, the cells were washed three times with MEM and then further overlaid with VGM containing 0.8% agarose in the presence or absence of ODNs.

In contrast, A151 did not inhibit significantly plaque formation of both strains, and K3 was only moderately effective against PR8. Therefore, we focused on D35 and examined its inhibitory effect against other influenza A viruses.

In contrast, D35 did not significantly affect viral growth of WSN, whose plaque formation was not suppressed by D35. These results indicated that virus strains whose plaque formation was suppressed by D35 also showed growth suppression by D35 in infected cells without agarose.",

Thus we examined whether the G-tetrad formation would affect D35's suppressive effect on the plaque formation. We used two ODNs, Core-12 which removed 5 0 and 3 0 end poly(G) motifs and 7-deaza D35 which replaced 5 0 and 3 0 end guanines with 7-deazaguanines to impede G-tetrad formation (Table 1 ).

Since it takes 8e12 h for influenza viruses to produce its progeny viruses after virus absorption, four treatment intervals covering the whole life cycle of influenza viruses from absorption to progeny production were used to disclose the time frame when D35 exerted the maximal effect. D35 was applied during each of these intervals and the cells were washed three times with MEM at specific time points. Following the treatment, fresh compound-free VDM was then continuously maintained in VGM with or without 10 or 30 mg/ml D35 at 35 C. At every 24 hpi, the culture supernatants were collected, and the virus titers in the supernatant were assessed by plaque assay. Bars represent the mean \u00b1 standard deviation of three independent samples. added. All treated cells were harvested at 11.5 hpi, and the virus yield was determined by measuring virus titers of every culture. As shown in Fig. 4A , apparent inhibition of virus replication by D35 was observed when infected cells were treated with D35 only at the interval of 9e11.5 hpi, which corresponded to the late step of influenza virus replication such as budding or release from infected cells. In case of treatment during an interval of 0e1 hpi, a moderate inhibition (ca 30%) was observed in infected cells. However, D35 treatment during an interval of 1e6 or 4e9 hpi did not inhibit virus yield when compared to control groups. These results suggest that D35 inhibits the early and late steps of viral replication. Thus we next examined the suppressive effect of D35 against several strains at early and late steps of viral replication. A severe decrease of viral replication was observed in PR8, Pdm09, Panama, Wyoming, H5N1 and H7N7-infected cells when D35 was present only at the late stage, whereas little reduction in the viral growth of WSN was observed ( Fig. 4B and C) . The results suggested that D35 mainly suppressed the late stage of viral growth, which includes viral assembly and release from infected cells.",

The additive effect of D35 with oseltamivir D35 mainly targeted the 430-loop of PR8 NA, which was largely different from the target site of oseltaminir, a NA inhibitor that binds to the active site of the viral NA molecule. Thus we examined whether oseltamivir was effective against D35-resistant recombinant viruses or whether the oseltamivir-resistant virus was sensitive to D35. We used the recombinant virus H274Y, which is resistant to oseltamivir (Fig. 7A) (Carr et al., 2002) . Plaques were undetectable in MDCK cells infected with the oseltamivir-resistant H274Y in the presence of D35 or in the cells infected with K435E in the presence of oseltaminir. Next we found that D35 and oseltamivir had additive effect against PR8 by the result that adding 2 mg/ ml of D35 or 2 nM oseltamivir decreased the size of plaques, and adding both compounds decreased greater (Fig. 7B) . Moreover, D35 and oseltamivir showed additive effect against PR8 NA by in vitro NA activity assay (Fig. 7C) . These results suggest that the mechanism of D35 action differs from that of oseltamivir and that D35 shows the additive antiviral effect with oseltamivir.",

As shown in Fig. 8A , the mean weight loss of mice treated with D35 GpC after PR8 infection was significantly less than that of the PBStreated mice and its effect was similar to the case of oseltamivir treatment. Since mice that received D35 after infection exhibited weight loss at early times after infection (1e3 dpi), which was not observed in mice that received PBS or D35 GpC after infection, we supposed that D35 activated immune response, together with activated immune response by influenza virus infection, led to specific weight loss. In contrast, treatment of D35 before infection significantly inhibited weight loss of mice, but treatment of D35 GpC before infection was less efficient. Consistent with improved outcomes, D35, D35 GpC, and oseltamivir significantly reduced PR8 titers in lung homogenates examined at 55 hpi (Fig. 8B) .",

Here we found that the K435E mutation in the 430-loop of D35-sensitive PR8 NA changed it to D35-resistant. In addition, PR8 with NA containing the K432E mutation in the 430-loop was partially resistant to D35 (Fig. 6B) . The results suggest that the 430-loop of PR8 NA is the main target for D35, as well as DS. Using molecular dynamics simulations of influenza NA, extended conformational shifts of the 150-loop and 430-loop in NA were observed (Amaro et al., 2007 (Amaro et al., , 2009 ). It has been demonstrated that these NA regions can open to a much larger extent than was anticipated from prior X-ray structure analyses, which can be systematically explored for the development of more potent, chemically diverse inhibitors. It has been reported that a novel small-molecule inhibitor can inhibit viral replication of both the H1N1 and H5N1 viruses and the compound is predicted to establish hydrogen bonds with residues V116 and R156 of the 150-loop and T439 of the 430-loop . They also suggested that another binding site within the pocket formed by the 430-loop could be accessed by the new inhibitors. Therefore, D35 which targets the 430-loop should be a novel anti-influenza drug.",

However, a marked increase in oseltamivir-resistant isolates has been reported and these strains have become prevalent worldwide (Hauge et al., 2009; Hurt et al., 2009) . We showed that the recombinant virus H274Y, which is resistant to oseltamivir, was sensitive to D35, K435E was sensitive to oseltamivir, and D35 and oseltamivir had additive effect against PR8 (Fig. 7) . These results indicate that the region of the NA responsible for oseltamivirsensitivity differs from that for D35-sensitivity, and that D35 might be useful for the treatment of infection with oseltamivirresistant virus. However, since we have not determined whether D35 reduces replication of recent oseltamivir-resistant virus strains, it should be studied in future. In case of treating AIDS, combination therapy, which uses two or more drugs simultaneously to inhibit HIV replication, has been developed to lower toxicity by decreasing the dosage of individual compounds. This approach reduces the risk of developing drug resistance and maintains synergistic antiviral activity (De Clercq, 1995) , and would be a major advance in the treatment of influenza virus infection.",

Amphipathic and polyanionic PS-oligonucleotides (ONs) have a sequenceindependent antiviral activity (Gao et al., 1990; Yao et al., 1993; Fennewald et al., 1995) . PS-ONs prevent viral attachment or entry via interaction with viral glycoproteins such as HIV-1, herpes simplex virus (HSV) and hepatitis C virus (Vaillant et al., 2006; Guzman et al., 2007; Matsumura et al., 2009) . However, the antiviral activity of PS-ONs is dependent on the length and hydrophobicity of the ONs. It has been known that phosphorothioation increases the hydrophobicity of ONs (Agrawal et al., 1990) . The increased hydrophobicity of PS-ONs contributes to their inhibitory activity against HIV-1 fusion and entry, because longer PS-ONs (30 bases) which have a greater hydrophobicity are more potent in blocking the hydrophobic interactions involved in the gp41 six-helix bundle formation and inhibiting the HIV-1-mediated cellecell fusion than shorter PS-ONs (<30 bases) (Vaillant et al., 2006) . The antiviral The culture supernatants from MDCK cells containing each influenza A virus were treated with or without D35, followed by the measurement of NA activity in the samples as described in Materials and Methods. The relative NA activity was determined as the mean percent, given in % of the control values. Lines represent the mean \u00b1 standard deviation of three independent samples. (B) MDCK cells were infected with PR8 or WSN at a MOI of 5 at 37 C. After viral adsorption, VDM without D35 was added to the cells. At 8 hpi, the cultures were washed three times, and VDM with or without 50 mg/ ml D35 was added to the cells. At 12 hpi, the cells were processed for EM at a magnification of 3000. activity of PS-ONs in duck hepatitis B virus infectionis also size dependent, with PS-ONs 40 bases in length displaying the highest activity (Noordeen et al., 2013) . Thus we speculated that longer PS-ODNs than K3 (20 bases) would have an anti-influenza activity.",

Moreover, a GT rich 20 base PS-ODN has a potent antiviral activity against HSV which is thought to be mediated by a conformational change in the viral glycoprotein gB (Shogan et al., 2006) . D35 inhibited significantly the replication of influenza viruses, but A151, which did not multimerize and form aggregates, did not (Figs. 1A and 2C). Thus our results suggest that in contrast to ODNs with an ability to inhibit HIV-1 or HSV, for inhibiting influenza A viruses ODNs need to mutimerize and aggregate. It has been reported that D19 (g^gtgcatcgatgcagg^g^g^g^g,^: phosphorothioated), which has same sequence as D35 and two more PS linkage at the 3 0 end poly(G) track than D35, consists an extremely heterogeneous mixture of secondary structures in DPBS and a portion of the D19 molecules exists as very high-order aggregates containing more than 30 D19 strands (Marshall et al., 2003) . We do not know why spontaneous formation of nanoparticles was responsible for inhibiting influenza A viruses; however, the antiviral activity of DS against a influenza A virus increases when the molecular weight is increased from 1000 to 10,000 and levels off when the molecular weight was further increased to 70,000 (Hosoya et al., 1991) .

            "text": "In conclusion, the TLR9 ligand D35 inhibited NA activity and replication of influenza A viruses. It was suggested that the basic amino acids in the 430-loop of PR8 NA were involved in D35sensitivity. D35 showed additive effect with oseltamivir. D35 and D35 GpC reduced viral replication in lungs of infected mice. Thus D35 could be used in combination with available NA inhibitors to treat influenza virus infections. Since D35 is well tolerated in clinical trials in nonhuman primates for Leishmania or malaria vaccine (Verthelyi et al., 2002; Tougan et al., 2013) , further in vivo and clinical studies are warranted. PR8-infected MDCK cells was treated with or without 1 mg/ml D35, 1 nM oseltamivir, or both, followed by the measurement of NA activity in the samples. The relative NA activity was determined as the mean percent, given in % of the control values. Lines represent the mean \u00b1 standard deviation of three independent samples. Fig. 8 . The effect of D35 in mouse. Eight-week-old female BALB/c mice were treated with 10 mg/kg D35 or D35 GpC 18 h before, or 10 mg/kg D35, D35 GpC, oseltamivir or PBS 6 h after intranasal infection with 100 PFU of PR8 virus. (A) Weight loss was monitored daily for 14 days. n \u00bc 10 mice/group. (B) To obtain virus titers, lungs were isolated at 55 hpi, homogenized and virus titers determined on MDCK cells. Titers are expressed as PFU/lung homogenate. n \u00bc 5 mice/group.",
