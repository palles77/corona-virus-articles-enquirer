Since the beginning of October 2018, the outbreak has largely shifted into regions in which active armed conflict has been reported, and in which EVD cases and their contacts have been difficult for health workers to reach. We used an ensemble of models to estimate EVD transmission rates and to forecast the short-and long-term course of the outbreak. Our models project that a final size of roughly up to 300 additional cases is most likely, and estimate that transmission rates are higher than would be seen under optimal levels of contact tracing and vaccination.

This region of DRC (Fig 1) has 5 over five million inhabitants, some of whom suffer from armed conflict, humanitarian 6 crisis, and displacement to the bordering countries of Uganda and Rwanda [2]. Since 7 the outbreak began, its magnitude has surpassed all other EVD outbreaks in DRC, 8 becoming the second largest in history to date.

            "text": "During an Ebola outbreak, real-time forecasting has the potential to support 28 decision-making and allocation of resources, but highly accurate forecasts have proven 29 difficult for Ebola [8, 9] as well as other diseases [10] [11] [12] [13] . Highly accurate forecasts of 30 small, noisy outbreaks may be a fundamentally elusive ideal [14] . Previous work has 31 found that probabilistic forecasts can have relatively high accuracy within a few weeks, 32 though they become less useful as time horizons grow longer [15] . Thus, short-term against subsequently known counts. Although the epidemic was officially reported on 63 August 1 as a cluster of cases occurring in June and July, seven sporadic early cases 64 from April and May were subsequently linked to the current outbreak and were added 65 to later case totals [3] . This additional knowledge was added retrospectively to the time 66 series of cumulative case counts only for predictions made for days on or after 67 September 15, when these cases were officially linked to the current outbreak. 68 Stochastic model 69 We modeled Ebola virus (EBOV) transmission using a stochastic branching process 70 model, parameterized by transmission rates estimated from the dynamics of prior EVD 71 outbreaks and conditioned on agreement with reported case counts from the 2018 EVD 72 outbreak to date. We incorporated high and low estimates of vaccination coverage into 73 this model. We used this model to generate a set of probabilistic projections of the size 74 of simulated outbreaks in the current setting. This model is similar to one described in 75 previous work [16] , with the addition of a smoothing step allowing for a continuum of 76 transmission rates interpolated between those estimated from prior outbreaks. 77 On the assumption that past outbreaks provide a basis for projection of the current 78 outbreak, we used estimates of transmission rates from past EVD outbreaks to 79 parameterize simulations of the current outbreak. To estimate the reproduction number 80 R in past outbreaks as a function of the number of days from the beginning of the 81 outbreak, we included reported cases by date from fourteen prior outbreaks (Table S1 in 82 S1 Supporting Information), [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . To reflect the Ebola response system in DRC 83 during what is now its tenth outbreak, the first historical outbreak reported in each 84 country was excluded (e.g. the 1976 outbreak in Yambuko, DRC), as there is a 85 difference in the Ebola response system as well as community sensitization to EVD 86 following a country's first outbreak. We used the Wallinga-Teunis technique to estimate 87 R for each case and therefore for each reporting date in these outbreaks [31] . The serial 88 interval distribution used for this estimation was a gamma distribution with a mean of 89 14.5 days and a standard deviation of 5 days, with intervals rounded to the nearest 90 whole number of days, consistent with the understanding that the serial interval of EVD 91 cases ranges from 3 to 36 days with mean 14 to 15 days. Transmission rates estimated by day in these outbreaks tend to decline from initially 93 high to eventually low values, though they may display substantial fluctuations. This 94 \"quenching\" of transmission may be driven by formal interventions such as quarantine, or 95 by informal changes in individuals' behavior in response to the disease or by depletion 96 of uninfected contacts of infective individuals, or by other causes. We incorporated this 97 pattern into our model by estimating an initial reproduction number R initial and 98 quenching rate \u03c4 for each outbreak by fitting an exponentially quenched curve to the 99 outbreak's estimates of R by day d (Fig S2 in S1 Supporting Information), and used 100 these pairs of parameters, one from each past outbreak, to construct a joint distribution 101 of initial reproduction numbers and quenching rates for outbreak simulation. 102 We simulated EBOV transmission using a stochastic branching process model in 103 which the number of secondary cases caused by any given primary case is drawn from a 104 negative binomial distribution, whose mean is the reproduction number R as a function 105 of day of the outbreak, and variance is controlled by a dispersion parameter k [32, 33]. 106",

This limit on underestimates was applied only to analysis of data sets from later 159 than October 13, to preserve unaltered the projection methods we reported in a 160 preprint of this paper [34] . Filtering tolerances were as follows: when using the August 161 20 data set, we allowed a tolerance of 4 cases more or less than each target count; for 162 August 27 and September 5, 6 cases; for September 15, 10 cases; for October 7, 12 cases; 163 for October 13, 17 cases; for November 1, 41 cases; for November 20, 55 cases; for The ring vaccination study found the vaccine to be effective against cases with onset 177 dates 10 days or more from the date of vaccine administration, so we modeled the 178 vaccination program as a proportionate reduction in the number of new cases with 179 onsets 10 days or more after the program start date. 180 We used past estimates of the proportion of unreported cases to estimate the 181 proportion of exposed individuals not covered by the vaccination process. Based on a 182 Sierra Leonean study from the 2013-2016 outbreak [37], we estimated the proportion of 183 reported cases (out of all known cases) in DRC to range from a low of 68% to a high of 184 96%, as extremes of the best known range of estimates, to be evaluated on their fit to 185 data. Given these low and high estimates of reported cases and the estimate of vaccine 186 effectiveness, a low estimate of vaccination program coverage was 44% (68% \u00d7 64.6%) 187 and a high estimate of vaccination program coverage was 62% (96% \u00d7 64.6%).",

For the ring 337 vaccination program to be theoretically effective at reducing transmission, an uncertain 338 proportion of contacts and contacts of contacts need to receive the vaccine [6]. We 339 estimated that transmission rates are higher than would be expected under target levels 340 of 62% coverage due to contact tracing and vaccination.

This model estimate may serve as a loose 344 proxy for the outbreak response challenges. Thus, outbreak response teams may need to 345 consider other control and care strategies to end the outbreak.

While it would be desirable to use the vaccination 400 coverage estimates to estimate the number of cases prevented by the vaccination 401 program, our models were not designed to produce a testable estimate of such an effect. 402Gott's rule[39], presented initially as reflecting a \"Copernican\" principle with 403 respect to time, assumed that ones observation of the age of a phenomenon occurred at 404 a random time during its lifetime. Gott applied this principle in a variety of settings,405    including the lifetime of Broadway shows, the Berlin Wall, and of the human406 race [39, 40]. Critics suggest that Gott's rule gives misleading predictions when the 407 phenomenon in question exhibits known time scales, such as in prediction of human 408 lifetimes [40, 41]. Gott's rule has not been validated for epidemics, and in this case, is 409 based on an assumption that the current case count in an epidemic occurs at a random 410 point in its progression. For an easily detected but uncontrollable supercritical epidemic, 411 we would expect forecasts based on the first reports to underestimate the final size. For 412 an easily controlled epidemic, forecasts would more likely be too pessimistic, since 413 control measures would (by assumption) swiftly end the epidemic after recognition. Our 414 application of the rule is intended to serve as a null hypothesis-like comparator for the 415 other methods. 416 Our models do not account for spatial heterogeneity in transmission, which may be 417 relevant to the course of this outbreak, in which an increase in transmission appears to 418 coincide with a shift in location. The stochastic model may be sensitive to the 419 assumption of an exponentially decaying curve for transmission rate by day, and 420 alternative assumptions might lead to a different distribution of forecast outcomes. 421 Indeed, all of our projections are conditional on model assumptions being met.
