Its objectives were to: understand areas where modelling terms, methods and results are unclear; share information on how modelling can best be used in informing policy and improving practice, particularly regarding the ways to integrate a focus on health equity considerations; and sustain and advance collaborative work in the development and application of modelling in public health.",

The expected outcome was to identify the infrastructure, expertise and resources necessary to establish a 'Communities of Practice' (CoP) network. The CoP concept, initially developed by Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger, refers to groups of people who share a concern, a set of problems or a passion about something they do, and learn how to do it better by interacting regularly (5) (6) (7) (8) . The proposed CoP, as a new initiative to be catalyzed from this workshop, would offer new approaches to addressing problems at different levels of health care and population health and enable the development of strategic plans to move evidence to action. An important role for this CoP is to develop a common language that can be used in understanding the outcomes of health research and disease modelling.",

Before the 2003 SARS epidemic, modelling activities were largely driven by research interests of individuals or small groups, with a significant emphasis on the theoretical aspects of exploring complex mathematical phenomena. For the most part, these activities were carried out in isolation, with minimal communication and engagement with public health professionals and policymakers (2) . During and following the SARS epidemic, various groups of disease modellers were formed to engage with, and develop models for application to public and population health in more specific contexts. Despite the importance and relevance of these initiatives, knowledge translation remained a challenge that the Pan-InfORM was established in part to address (9).",

Situations are often very complex for a number of reasons including the availability and adequacy of health resources; inconsistent or absent evidence regarding the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of intervention strategies; pressure from the public, media and government under which public health must operate; other competing public health services; and ethical considerations to balance the protection of community health against individuals' rights and freedoms. Other pertinent challenges include the lack of data to estimate potential outcomes of a public health program, paralysis resulting from having too much information on occasion, differing opinions and short timelines. In this context, as one presenter put it, there are three questions decision makers face: what is the benefit of the public health program or intervention; who will benefit from the program and; is the program cost-effective?

During the construction and validation of a model, the relevance and importance of input parameters must be understood, and the sources for their values and ranges, uncertainty about the parameters, and sensitivity of the model outcomes with respect to parameter variation and original model assumptions, must be determined. New knowledge generated by a model should address the target question and be translated and disseminated for uptake and action appropriate to the context. Furthermore, when data are limited, it is essential to quantify any uncertainty in parameterization, because different sets of parameters may fit equally well.

The review found that disparate outcomes and interpretations for policy decisions may arise from inconsistent use of terms in model structures, even when the assumptions and input parameters are identical. Discrepancies in how terms are used for modelling are generally associated with two main reasons. First, it is often assumed that the particular terms are well defined or well understood. For example, 'infectiousness' and 'infectious' were found to be used interchangeably; the former describes a characteristic of the disease and/or how readily the disease is transmitted, while the latter describes a patient state (13) . Second, definitions of some terms have drifted over time as understanding of the mechanisms of disease processes and control has evolved. For example, the way terms such as 'prevention', 'protection' and 'reduced susceptibility' are used related to communicable disease may lead to different results depending how they are used in modelling.

Develop opportunities for public health personnel to learn more about models and their value language will help to reduce possible variation in study results produced by different research communities.

The latter can be exemplified in two recent studies on the effectiveness of school closure during pandemic influenza outbreaks. When assessing the effect of school closure strategies in reducing community attack rates, Halder et al (14) found that due to the difficulty in determining the true degree of epidemic spread and its severity in the early stages of an outbreak, a strategy of individual school closures would be more effective than simultaneous closures across a region. The outcomes are drawn from an agent-based simulation model of Albany, a small community in Western Australia with a popula tion of approximately 30,000 individuals. In contrast, to evaluate the impact of local reactive school closures on critical care provision in the United Kingdom population setting, House et al (15) concluded that school closures should be coordinated in time (simultaneous) and location (all schools within a school district) to become an effective strategy to reduce infection transmission and, consequently, relieve capacity pressures of hospital intensive care unit admissions. The population demographics and the objectives for closing schools are distinctly different between the two studies, suggesting that different modelling approaches are required for measuring the effectiveness of school closures.",

Furthermore, in times of uncertainty, the virtual CoP network will provide opportunities to access, analyze, synthesize and utilize reliable information and databases in a timely fashion, and drive a broad consensus around plausible alternatives and integrated courses of action. It is also true, however, that ongoing discussions between modellers and public health personnel will help to clarify language use and break down perceived barriers.",
