We find that the majority of infections are asymptomatic by most symptom definitions and that only 4% of individuals experiencing a seasonal coronavirus infection episode sought medical care for their symptoms. These numbers indicate that a very high percentage of seasonal coronavirus infections are undocumented and provide a reference for understanding the spread of the emergent nCoV.",

To contextualize the issue of unreported infection, we here present the findings from a recent proactive sampling project carried out in New York City (NYC) that documented rates of asymptomatic infection and clinical care-seeking among individuals shedding seasonal CoV (types: HKU1, 229E, NL63 and OC43).",

The US CDC only began releasing CoV positivity rates in 2018, and understanding of its epidemiological features is incomplete. Here, we present direct measurement of rates of seeking clinical care and show that only 4% (6 of 135) of persons shedding seasonal CoV sought care. Reporting rates and rates of seeking medical care may differ, as most individuals visiting a clinician for acute respiratory illness are not tested for seasonal CoV. However, testing for the 2019 nCoV is expected to be more robust than for seasonal CoV as there is pressing need to understand and contain this novel pathogen. This high testing rate could result in the reporting rate for nCoV equaling the rate of seeking medical care. Thus, if rates of seeking medical care for nCoV were to align with seasonal CoV, the reporting rate for nCoV would approach 4%. Should the remaining 96% of unreported infections be sufficiently contagious, their high numbers could support rapid spread of nCoV.",

Further, early outbreak instances of death due to nCoV occurred predominantly in elderly patients, and often elderly with co-morbidities (6) .
