That suggests a connection between birds, especially waterfowl, and the microbes' capacity to travel on our jet planes. These microbes evolved to do well on hosts that fly great distances.

In their former ecologies, there had been time for co-evolution between parasite and host, often producing non-pathological coexistence and not infrequently symbiotic relations [13] .

The orchards attracted fruit bats whose normal habitats had been disrupted by deforestation; their droppings contained the as yet unknown paramyxovirus and infected the pigs. The overcrowding led to explosive transmission rates and to infections in pig handlers. So a virus that was once not disruptively epidemic became so because of human disruptions of natural habitats of bats and overcrowding of pigs, driven by global commercial interests. The Malaysian government culled over 1 million pigs [7, p. 243; 15] . The ecological upset from deforestation proved to be linked with novel human pathogens and the threat of transporting such disease globally. The bats are also sold in markets in China to be eaten and used in traditional medicine. When the human health problem is so tied into forest ecosystems, stressed by global trade in timber, complicated by global meat markets, any analysis will be inadequate that sees the problem as a virus in the bats.",

Culling wild animals is more difficult, especially in developing nations. But hunting pressures on such animals may be increased. Often the killing in the wild is by reverse contamination. This spread of contagion is a two-way street. Recent quantitative analysis finds that anthropogenic introduction of pathogens (called \"pathogen pollution\") may account for 60 percent of the emerging diseases of wildlife [38] . Endangered wildlife populations can be pushed to the brink of extinction by these links generating new stresses as a result of commercial pressures, and, under fear of emerging pathogens, efforts in surveillance and control [39].",

Ecosystems are full of diseases and we cannot let them spread into our human cultures. So we must eliminate the natural reservoirs. Facing the threat of pandemic diseases, Andrew Dobson, an ecologist at Princeton University, concludes that conservation biology has \"almost as important a role as medical schools.\" He continues, finding that there are two alternatives in thinking of the disease etiology: \"either to reduce the prevalence of the pathogen in the reservoir host, or to identify the conditions that lead to spillover and attempt to minimize these\" [15, p. 629 ]. The first tries to fix the problem by focus on the reservoir in wild nature. The second fixes the problem by focus on the upsets that humans have introduced to trigger the pandemic and create a route for its spread.",

Habitat fragmentation displaces wild animals, and the animals in atypical circumstances may provide new niches for their pathogens, or the displaced animals may carry their pathogens to new hosts, often domesticated animals. Populations of humans or domestic animals exposed to new infectious organisms, especially when crowded or stressed, may develop explosive epidemics, although the pathogen endemic in its original niche is carried by its hosts at low-level and without serious disease outbreak [40] . In natural ecosystems, pathogens and parasites are, for the most part, integrated into the routines of these systems -although even in wild nature there are occasional epidemics. But presumably these viruses and microbes are adapted fits in the niches they occupy in wild nature; the birds and the wildlife have usually learned to live with them [23] .",

Many do. But, surprisingly, we are now finding that we can also invite an unprecedented explosion, a pandemic. Since we create the context in which the pandemic appears, one can as well say that we humans create the disease as that the disease originates in wild nature. HIV/AIDS, before jumping to humans, existed in primate populations in Africa, with which it had co-evolved. It might never have emerged as pandemic if it were not for the social disruptions in post-colonial and sub-Saharan Africa, with the bush-meat trade; the movement of rural populations to large and crowded cities, caught in poverty there; with disrupted family structures promoting promiscuity and prostitution -all of which facilitate HIV transmission [7, p. 243 ].",

On a field trip examining the aftermath of the massive 1988 Yellowstone fires in the company of fire ecologists, I asked whether this or that fire was caused by lightning or by careless humans. An ecologist replied: It makes no difference whether the source of ignition was a human match or a lightning bolt. The cause of the fire was the overload of fuel building up from decades of fire suppression. Yellowstone was a fire waiting to happen; if a camper does not ignite it this year, a lightning bolt will next year, or the year after that. Put the lodgepole under stressed fuel load, and you will get a fire, later if not sooner.",
