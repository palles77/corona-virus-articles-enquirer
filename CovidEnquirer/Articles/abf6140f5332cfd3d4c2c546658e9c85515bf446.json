Relationship between angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion (ACE I/D) polymorphism and the prognosis of local Chinese patients with ALI was investigated; meanwhile, the mechanisms involved were explored. Methods: 101 ALI patients, 408 non-ALI patients and 236 healthy blood donors were enrolled. ACE I/D polymorphism was detected by polymerase chain reaction, then ACE genotype (II, ID, DD) and allele (I, D) frequencies were compared. Clinical data of ALI patients was calculated. Also, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from healthy volunteers with different ACE genotypes. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ACE gene mRNA expression and ACE activity was measured. Results: There was no significant difference in the frequencies of the genotypes and alleles. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score was higher in DD subgroup than in II subgroup (19.7 AE 8.7 and 15.6 AE 6.2; P < 0.05). The 28-day mortality was significantly different (17.4%, 26.8%, and 64.3% for II, ID, and DD; P Z 0.013). DD genotype was the independent prognostic factor for 28-day outcome. Furthermore, LPS-induced ACE mRNA expression and ACE activity from PBMC in DD genotype subgroup were both significantly higher than those in the other two subgroups. Conclusions: ACE I/D polymorphism is a prognostic factor for ALI. Patients with the DD genotype have higher mortality of ALI. Polymorphism influences the expression of ACE gene in LPS-stimulated PBMC, DD genotype leads to higher level of mRNA and enzyme activity. It may be one of the mechanisms involved. \u00aa a v a i l a b l e a t w w w . s c i e n c e d i r e c t . c o m j o u r n a l h o m e p a g e : w w w . e l s e v i e r . c o m / l o c a t e / r m e d Respiratory Medicine (2011) 105, 1485e1490 0954-6111/$ -see front matter \u00aa",

Generally speaking, infection is the primary cause, which induces excessive cytokines from inflammatory cells and enhances inflammatory response. Factors predicting the onset, severity or outcome of this disease are not well known. Experimental evidence suggests that activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), especial angiotensin (AT) may influence the pathogenesis of ALI via affecting inflammation including producing inflammatory factors and apoptosis. 1 Angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) is a key enzyme that converts AT-I to AT-II. The human ACE gene is located on chromosome 17q23, while its polymorphism is consists of the presence (insertion, I) and absence (deletion, D) of a 287-bp Alu repeat sequence in intron 16. 2 ACE I/D polymorphism has been shown to influence the prognosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome, 2 and is different with various races and districts. 3 There was no report of ACE genotypes in the Han Chinese with ALI in the district.",

Just like many similar studies suggested that the genotype was not an independent risk factor. 6, 7 However, compared with both the CABG (coronary artery bypass grafting) and ICU comparison groups and the healthy population sample, the frequency of the DD genotype and the D allele was markedly increased in patients with ARDS, which may show this relationship in ARDS. 8 The differences may result from study object, pathogeny and the degree of disease. 9e11 As shown in many reports, there were associations between ACE I/D polymorphism and prognosis of many diseases. 2,3,12e14 Our finding also indicated the patients with the DD genotype were more emergent and had higher mortality. DD genotype was the significant independent prognostic factors for the 28-day outcome. Though cases in the study were not sufficient, the proportions of the ACE genotypes were similar to those previously reported in Chinese ethnic groups. However, due to a relatively small proportion of people carrying the DD genotype in the general population among Asian people, more cases may be required.",

LPS is an effective activator which may increase ACE mRNA expression and ACE activity in all genotypes. Among the three genotypes, PBMC of DD genotype has the highest level after exposure to LPS. It may be the pathway triggered due to ACE polymorphism. It is well known that the renin-angiotensin system play an important role in inflammation. AT has a proinflammatory effect for the development or aggravation of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome. ACE I/D polymorphism had been shown to be associated with injury to lung tissue in severe acute respiratory syndrome. 15 Moreover, ACE plays a major role in the host defense against invading pathogens. 16 It is therefore that polymorphisms in the ACE gene may have an important effect on determining the development and the outcome of ALI.",
