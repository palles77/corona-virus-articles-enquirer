This book has described in detail one of the methods. The achievement of success in a method of rapid virus diagnosis cannot, in itself, be a final aim, otherwise the method would degenerate solely into a rapid routine method for identifying virus agents and the virologist would become a biological philatelist. An applied science, to justify itself, must bring benefit to the main clientele, which is in this case the physicians and the patients. In this chapter it is intended to evaluate the applications of rapid immunofluorescence diagnosis in clinical medicine.",

The presence of viruses at the site of illness usually means that the virus is associated with that illness and is almost certainly causal. There are exceptions to this, such as enteroviruses in stools and adenoviruses both in stools and the respiratory tract, but even here they have caused infection and, because they have the property of being excreted for a long time, may be found at the site after the acute phase has passed. However, in lesions of the skin, central nervous system and respiratory tract, viruses found in the presence of symptoms should be taken as causal. In the respiratory tract, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus and the parainfluenza viruses are seldom if ever found without illness. The rapid diagnosis of a virus infection in 2-3 hours after admission to hospital revolutionizes the attitude of physicians. They are no longer dealing with a disease of unknown aetiology for most, if not all, of the patient's stay in hospital but with one which is a precise entity immediately known.",

Therefore, if antiviral therapy is to stand any chance of success a diagnosis must be made as near to the time of onset of symptoms as possible.

This delaying process will allow the normal immunological defences of the body to respond fully and thus terminate what might be an overwhelming virus infection. The most vulnerable groups are therefore the young, perhaps the very old and those who are immunosuppressed.

Measles, too, occasionally causes death in the normal child but is a major cause of death in the immunosuppressed child, who is usually undergoing antitumour therapy (see page 292). The majority of respiratory viruses are labile and by necessity most autopsies need to be delayed at least 18 hours, often much longer, in order to obtain the consent of relatives.

Therapy not only includes the above-mentioned drugs but also radiation. Recent months have seen the development of techniques for the grafting of bone marrow transplants after whole-body irradiation. These measures have proved highly successful as regards the primary condition which now can, in many instances, be cured. However, during the treatment the child is left highly vulnerable and susceptible to infection. Infection has therefore become the major cause of death in acute lymphatic leukaemia, the majority of these infections being associated with viruses. The viruses involved are rhinoviruses, measles, mumps, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus and the other everyday viruses which normal children easily combat. However, children with leukaemia and under therapy can die of rhinovirus pneumonia, and most children who are infected with measles during the course of their leukaemia also die. In a defined study of virus infections in childhood leukaemias, their importance in morbidity and mortality has been clearly demonstrated (Craft et al., 1977 (Craft et al., , 1978 (Craft et al., , 1979 . The numbers of patients both in remission and relapse in whom viruses were associated with death are indicated in Table 15 . A distinct feature of infectious illness in the immunosuppressed child is its unusual symptomology. Measles is especially severe, often fatal, but seldom has a rash; respiratory syncytial virus, less often seen in childhood after 1-2 years of age, causes severe and prolonged symptoms in the older immunosuppressed child. On many occasions, onset of a virus infection can be sudden and severe, with death rapidly intervening. Rapid diagnosis in these circumstances has become a vital procedure; it is a guide both to the amount of immunosuppressive therapy which should be given at this time and to specific antiviral treatment needed. The coating of infected epithelial cells by locally produced antibody in the normal infected child has already been discussed but the position is often very different in the immunosuppressed child. Depending on the stage of the illness and the treatment regimen, many of these children are incapable of producing an antibody response either locally in the respiratory tract or humorally. Infected cells therefore continue to be excreted for long periods of time and their appearance, when stained by immunofluorescence, is indistinguishable from that of a normal child's cells in the first day or two of an acute illness. Figure 77 illustrates respiratory syncytial virus-infected cells in the secretions of a child aged 4 years with acute lymphatic leukaemia and a severe bronchitis which lasted for 64 days. It shows the number and brightness of respiratory syncytial virus-infected cells at the thirty-fifth day of illness-there is no evidence whatsoever of coating.",

Measles is particularly difficult to diagnose in the immunosuppressed child because of its very varied picture. It is possible that early treatment with interferon might alter what has, up till now, been a very gloomy prognosis; the use of rapid diagnosis and interferon therapy in measles is currently being investigated in a multicentred study. However, the key to any successful chemotherapy must lie in early diagnosis, and the screening of secretions for respiratory viruses even in mild infections should include a test for measles. Immunofluorescence enables this to be done. In the normal child with measles, infected cells, including giant cells, are rarely seen after the third day of rash (McQuillin et al, 1976) . The picture is totally different in the immunosuppressed child with measles. In these circumstances the secretions are loaded with giant cells which continue to be excreted, usually until the child dies (Pullan et al, 1976) . These virusloaded giant cells are far more numerous and observed for a far longer period than those which occur in the normal child even at the height of his Viruses producing unusual symptoms 295 rash. Figure 78 illustrates the appearance of such a giant cell on the twentyfirst day of a measles illness that had become complicated by the development of an interstitial pneumonia. Plate 18 illustrates a giant cell in a lung impression smear of a leukaemic child who died with measles pneumonitis. There is every hope that the immunofluorescent techniques will not only simplify the diagnosis of these cases but be a guide to the effect of interferon in the ongoing coded trials.",

Anecdotes may help to emphasize the problem. An infant aged 3 months, immobile because of a fractured femur, was nursed in a two-bedded cubicle and, during the winter respiratory rush, a child with a rapidly diagnosed respiratory syncytial virus croup was admitted to the free bed, which was the only one available.

In fact, the latter illnesses were all pneumonias and a number of these patients died. The patients with influenza A infection admitted to hospital are usually older than those admitted with respiratory syncytial virus infection. The usual reason for admission is a febrile convulsion. Frequently by the time they have been admitted to hospital they have recovered from their convulsion and have lost their fever. Being relatively well at this stage, they run around the ward coughing and secreting virus over patients who can ill afford to acquire infections, such as patients with mucoviscidosis, congenital heart disease or leukaemia or on immunosuppressive therapy. It is the latter group of patients who fare badly when acquiring influenza A. Unfortunately, toddlers are not respecters of cubicles, which to them are no barrier. It is essential that ward staff realize that febrile convulsions in 50 per cent of cases can be of viral origin and when influenza A is prevalent the percentage of febrile convulsions due to this cause and admitted to hospital rises to very much higher than average (Stokes et ai, 1976) . They must also realize the serious consequences of cross-infection in debilitated children. Rapid diagnosis by immunofluorescence has provided a method for identifying influenza A within 3 hours of admission to hospital. Now that the risks of influenza A cross-infections are known, every child with a febrile convulsion admitted to hospital when influenza A is prevalent must be examined and also confined to a cubicle until the result of the rapid diagnostic test is available.

All children admitted with respiratory illness were examined and specimens taken by ward staff and sent to the local pathology laboratory which had no virus facilities. Staff there prepared the slides and fixed them, dispatching them to Newcastle where they were examined. Table  17 shows the results of the study. All the respiratory viruses found in conurbations were also found in West Cumbria causing the same illnesses. However, their incidence was 2-3 times less. Specimens were sent by post and always reached Newcastle within 24 hours of dispatch. They were examined on arrival and the result telephoned the same day. This proved very satisfactory for an area which previously had no virus diagnostic service and indeed under the circumstances could still be considered as rapid virus diagnosis.",

Collection of specimens, their transportation under suitable conditions to the laboratory for virus isolation and the sampling of all illnesses from the most trivial to the most severe in all age groups and both sexes have proved to be the chief stumbling blocks. To obtain some idea of the virus epidemiology of an area, the total admission of patients to the hospital covering that area can be investigated. Hospital admissions, however, can only reflect the viruses present in the community as only the most severely ill patients are admitted, but nevertheless much useful information can be obtained. Many such surveys have been carried out both in Newcastle and in various parts of the country (Report by the Medical Research Council, 1978) ; the most recent report gave valuable information on the occurrence of epidemics of respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B and parainfluenza viruses over a 6-year period, the interrelationships of these viruses and the effect of climatic conditions, and admission rates to hospital (Martin, Gardner and McQuillin, 1978) . The use of immunofluorescence for rapid virus diagnosis made possible the investigation of a greater number of patients and the diagnosis of a wider range of viruses than could be achieved by routine methods. The study was based on total hospital admissions and included 2311 identifications by immunofluorescence of respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2 and 3 and influenza A alone.",

Virus culture, however, still takes place mainly when the specimen submitted is unsuitable for immunofluorescence, for example when there are too few cells in the secretion or a throat swab has been submitted instead of a secretion. Under these circumstances, an agent causing a suspicious cytopathic effect can be immediately identified by immunofluorescence by scraping the cells off the culture tube, placing them on to a slide and staining in the usual way. This identifies the agent immediately without the necessity for a long and unsatisfactory neutralization test such as for respiratory syncytial virus or for a fastidious haemadsorption inhibition test for the identification of a haemadsorption virus.",
