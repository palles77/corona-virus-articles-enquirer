It is believed to be an autoimmune disease in which exposure of genetically predisposed individuals to environmental factors triggers a breakdown in T cell tolerance to myelin antigens. The specific types of myelin-specific T cells that contribute to the pathogenesis of MS are not known. Most studies have focused on the pathogenic role of myelin-specific CD4 + T cells because of the relatively strong association of MS susceptibility with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II alleles. In addition, CD4 + T cells are the primary effector T cells in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a widely used animal model of MS. However, there has been increasing recognition of the potential importance of CD8 + T cells in the pathogenesis of MS. CD8 + T cells typically outnumber CD4 + T cells in acute and chronic lesions in MS patients, and the CD8 + T cell subset exhibits more evidence of antigen-driven activation compared to CD4 + T cells in the CNS and blood of MS patients1, 2.

Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous MS susceptibility alleles, each of which (apart from HLA DR2) appears to contribute only slightly to the risk of developing MS5. This genetic complexity, together with the variability in the pathology, symptoms and clinical course of MS, suggest the possibility of multiple disease-initiating pathways. Disease heterogeneity may account for the difficulty in identifying environmental triggers of MS. While viral infections have long been proposed to initiate the disease process6-9, linking a particular virus to MS pathogenesis has not yet been achieved. Association with a specific infection is particularly difficult for a multifactorial disease like MS because a ubiquitous infection may trigger disease in only a small fraction of infected individuals depending upon the diverse interactions of their particular susceptibility alleles with the environment.",

Theilers murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection, another model for MS, has been shown to induce CNS autoimmunity by causing bystander activation of myelin specific CD4 + T cells10. However, no model has been described in which an infectious agent abrogates tolerance in myelin-specific CD8 + T cells. Here we utilized a MHC class I-restricted TCR transgenic model that generates CD8 + T cells specific for myelin basic protein (MBP) to investigate conditions that break CD8 + T cell tolerance and induce CNS autoimmunity. We previously generated two TCR transgenic models expressing distinct TCRs specific for MBP79-87 associated with the H-2K k MHC molecule11. Mice expressing a transgenic TCR comprised of V \u03b1 8 and V \u03b2 6 (referred to as 8.6 mice) exhibit both central and peripheral tolerance, consistent with the constitutive presentation of MBP in lymphoid and other tissues. In contrast, T cells expressing a transgenic TCR comprised of V \u03b1 8 and V \u03b2 8 (called 8.8 mice) escape central and peripheral tolerance, although they proliferate vigorously to MBP79-87 peptide in vitro. This split tolerance has also been observed for several CD4 + MBP-specific TCR transgenic models in which the low avidity of the interactions between the MBP-specific T cells and their ligand prevents responses to endogenous MBP in vivo, although the T cells can respond to MBP peptide in vitro. Tolerance in CD4 + TCR transgenic models is broken at some stochastic frequency as spontaneous EAE can occur, especially in the absence of regulatory T cells12, 13. Disease is also easily induced in CD4 + TCR transgenic models using immunization protocols that induce CD4 + T cell-mediated EAE in wild-type mice. The tolerance exhibited by CD8 + T cells in 8.8 mice differs from that of MBP-specific CD4 + T cells in that 8.8 T cells exhibit high avidity for their ligand and appear to remove the ligand from APCs without triggering T cell activation11. This observation suggested that circumstances leading to the loss of tolerance may differ for CD8 + and CD4 + MBP-specific T cells.",

Surprisingly, infection with wild-type vaccinia virus also triggered CNS autoimmunity as efficiently as recombinant virus expressing MBP despite a lack of cross-reactivity between the 8.8 TCR and viral epitopes.

This result indicated that regulatory T cells, which are absent in Rag2 \u2212/\u2212 8.8 mice (data not shown), are not required to prevent 8.8 T cells from responding to endogenous MBP. We investigated the susceptibility of 8.8 mice to active disease induction using a protocol that efficiently induces EAE in CD4 + MBP-specific TCR transgenic models and also induces autoimmune disease in a previously described CD8 + TCR transgenic humanized mouse model of MS in which the transgenic T cells recognize a MHC class I-restricted epitope of proteolipid protein (PLP)14. No neurological signs were observed in 8.8 mice immunized with MBP79-87 in complete Freunds adjuvant (CFA) with or without pertussis toxin injections (Supplementary Table 1 ). To assess whether peptide immunization is an efficient protocol for activating CD8 + 8.8 T cells, CFSE-labeled 8.8 and 8.6 T cells were transferred into Mbp \u2212/\u2212 mice that had been previously immunized with MBP79-87 in CFA and T cell proliferation was analyzed three days later. Although both 8.8 and 8.6 T cells proliferated equally well upon stimulation with MBP peptide in vitro, 8.8 T cells barely proliferated in vivo in response to adjuvant-activated antigen-presenting cells (APCs) presenting exogenous MBP peptide while 8.6 T cells proliferated strongly ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). To determine if 8.8 T cell tolerance could be abrogated by strong, widespread activation of the APCs that present endogenous MBP throughout the animal, we administered lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and agonistic CD40 antibody to 8.8 mice. Neither reagent, alone or in combination, induced disease in 8.8 mice. Likewise, no disease was observed in 8.8 mice treated with poly(I:C) (Supplementary Table 1 ). However, weight loss and mild neurological signs were observed in 8.8 mice when MBP peptide was simultaneously injected with both LPS and the CD40 antibody (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1 ). Injection of MBP peptide alone had no effect. These results suggest that both strongly activating APCs in multiple tissues and increasing the concentration of ligand above the amount generated from endogenous MBP are required to break 8.8 T cell tolerance in vivo.",

            "text": "The conditions for breaking 8.8 T cell tolerance described above suggested that CD8 + T cell-mediated autoimmunity might be triggered by a viral infection that causes both widespread APC activation and generates de novo expression of a self-antigen mimic. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that 8.8 mice exhibited a 100% incidence of autoimmune disease following infection with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing MBP (Vac-MBP). Unexpectedly, we also found that 8.8 mice infected with wild-type vaccinia virus exhibited the same incidence and severity of disease ( Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table  1 ). In both groups of mice, the disease was characterized by weight loss and clinical signs such as ataxia, knuckling, difficulty walking and tail weakness. The clinical course of disease is depicted as increasing weight loss as this is the most quantitative measure of disease progression; however, immunochemical analyses demonstrated infiltration of CD8 + T cells and F4/80 + macrophage and activated microglia in both the brain and spinal cord of wild-type vaccinia-infected 8.8 mice as expected in autoimmune disease targeting the CNS ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). The disease progressed rapidly and most mice were sacrificed nine days post infection. In some experiments, mice survived this acute disease and developed chronic neurological symptoms such as walking difficulty and tail weakness (Supplementary Video 1). Analyses of viral titers in lymphoid organs and the CNS following infection showed that 8.8 mice cleared vaccinia virus as efficiently as wild-type mice, indicating that the disease was not due to poor viral clearance in the TCR transgenic mice (data not shown). Effective viral clearance in 8.8 TCR transgenic mice was supported by the absence of clinical signs in Mbp \u2212/\u2212 8.8 mice infected with wild-type virus ( Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1 ). Wild-type vaccinia virus infection activated a population of 8.8 T cells in vivo identified by decreased MBP-H-2K k tetramer and CD62L staining and increased CD44 expression compared to uninfected mice (Fig. 1b) . These cells acquired effector function because MBP-pulsed splenocytes were specifically lysed when transferred into vacciniainfected but not na\u00efve 8.8 mice (Fig. 1c) . Accumulation of 8.8 T cells was observed in the CNS of vaccinia-infected Mbp +/+ but not Mbp \u2212/\u2212 8.8 mice and correlated with neurological symptoms (Fig. 1d) . These data indicate that wild-type vaccinia virus infection breaks 8.8 T cell tolerance and promotes an autoimmune response directed against endogenous MBP in the CNS. Viral infections have been proposed to trigger autoimmune disease via several mechanisms. Bystander activation of self-reactive T cells might occur if a viral infection causes the release of sequestered autoantigens into an inflammatory milieu. To test this possibility, Mbp \u2212/\u2212 8.8 mice were infected with wild-type vaccinia virus and T cells were analyzed for activation markers and the ability to lyse MBP-pulsed splenocytes in vivo. As observed for Mbp +/+ 8.8 mice, vaccinia infection induced a population of activated 8.8 T cells in Mbp \u2212/\u2212 mice that specifically lysed MBP-pulsed target cells in vivo (Fig. 2) . These results indicate that vaccinia infection does not activate 8.8 T cells via a bystander mechanism because the 8.8 T cells were activated in the absence of endogenous MBP.",

To determine if the inability of wild-type vaccinia virus to induce autoimmunity in Rag2 \u2212/\u2212 8.8 mice was due to the loss of CD4 + 8.8 T cells, Rag2 +/+ 8.8 mice were treated with anti-CD4 depleting antibody prior to vaccinia virus induction.

The decrease in disease severity in CD4 + T celldepleted vaccinia-infected 8.8 mice could be due either to a loss of pathogenic CD4 + 8.8 T cells or to a loss of help provided by CD4 + T cells to activated CD8 + 8.8 T cells. The later possibility is supported by the fact that adoptive transfer of 8.8 T cells that were stimulated with MBP peptide in vitro induced autoimmunity only when interleukin 2 (IL-2) was administered following T cell transfer (unpublished results).

Indeed, expression of dual TCRs containing endogenous TCR \u03b2-chains paired with transgenic TCR \u03b1-chains or endogenous TCR \u03b1-chains paired with transgenic TCR \u03b2-chains has been observed on peripheral T cells in several TCR transgenic models15-18. The possibility that expression of endogenous TCR chains on 8.8 T cells is required for susceptibility to wild-type virus-induced autoimmune disease suggested the hypothesis that vaccinia virus breaks 8.8 T cell tolerance by triggering T cell activation via a virus-specific TCR co-expressed with the MBP-specific TCR on 8.8 T cells. If this mechanism is correct, CD8 + T cells co-expressing the 8.8 TCR with particular endogenous TCR \u03b1and/or \u03b2-chains that confer specificity to viral antigens should be enriched in infected compared to uninfected 8.8 mice. To test this hypothesis, we compared the expression of a panel of TCR V \u03b2 chains (see Methods) on CD8 + T cells isolated from naive versus wild-type vaccinia-infected Rag2 +/+ 8.8 mice. While none of the antibodies specific for endogenous V \u03b2 chains detected populations >1% of CD8 + T cells in uninfected 8.8 mice (data not shown), T cells co-expressing V \u03b2 8 and V \u03b2 6 expanded following vaccinia infection (Fig. 5a) . The absolute number of V \u03b2 8 + V \u03b2 6 + T cells in the spleen increased >40fold in infected (n = 4) compared to na\u00efve (n = 8) 8.8 mice (P = 0.004). In contrast to V \u03b2 8 hi V \u03b2 6 \u2212 T cells, V \u03b2 8 + V \u03b2 6 + T cells exhibited an activated phenotype in infected mice (Fig.  5b) . To investigate the antigen specificity associated with V \u03b2 6 expression, T cells isolated from vaccinia-infected 8.8 mice were restimulated in vitro with vaccinia-infected splenocytes or MBP-pulsed splenocytes and analyzed for IFN-\u03b3 production and V \u03b2 6 expression. More than 50% of the T cells that produced IFN-\u03b3 in response to wild-type vaccinia-infected splenocytes expressed V \u03b2 6, while only 9.6% of T cells that produced IFN\u03b3 in response to MBP-pulsed splenocytes were V \u03b2 6 + , indicating that co-expression of V \u03b2 6 + preferentially conferred specificity for viral antigens (Fig. 5c) . To determine if 8.8 T cells co-expressing particular V \u03b1 chains also expanded in response to vaccinia infection, T cells exhibiting either a na\u00efve or activated phenotype were sorted from infected 8.8 mice and expression of different V \u03b1 chains was analyzed by real-time PCR. Expression of V \u03b1 11, 13 and 14 was enriched in activated compared to na\u00efve T cells isolated from infected mice ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ). Together these data indicate that T cells co-expressing the 8.8 TCR and specific endogenous TCR chains are expanded in response to vaccinia infection and activation of these T cells correlates with loss of 8.8 T cell tolerance and induction of autoimmune disease. This mechanism predicts that other viral infections would trigger autoimmunity in 8.8 mice, which is supported by our finding that adenovirus also induces autoimmunity in Rag2 +/+ 8.8 mice (Supplementary Table 1 ).",

Infection with Vac-MBP induces disease via a \"molecular identity\" mechanism in which the virus encodes an epitope recognized directly by the MBP-specific TCR. In contrast, infection with wild-type vaccinia virus breaks tolerance in T cells that express dual TCRs due to incomplete allelic exclusion of the Tcra or Tcrb loci. Activation via a co-expressed virus-specific TCR overcomes the lack of response of the MBP-specific 8.8 TCR to endogenous MBP such that the T cell is able to respond to both the viral epitope and endogenous MBP. Viral infection has long been postulated to be an environmental factor contributing to the etiology of MS. Although several different viruses have been implicated over the years19, 20, no specific virus has been confirmed as a causative agent in the pathogenesis MS. Because MS is a multifactorial disease5, it is possible that multiple viruses influence MS susceptibility, and the ability of any particular virus to contribute to the pathogenesis of MS may be dependent on the repertoire of susceptibility alleles each individual carries and their exposure to other pre-disposing environmental factors. Alternatively, MS may be triggered by a common infection that initiates disease in only a small fraction of infected people, as suggested by the geographical distribution of MS and the change in risk observed in migrants. In particular, a large body of evidence accumulated over the past two decades strongly implicates the human herpes Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) as a risk factor in the development of MS, operating independently of the risk contributed by the MHC DR15 allele20-23. Data from many studies show that the risk of developing MS is 15 times higher in EBV-positive compared to EBV-negative individuals and is two-threefold higher in individuals with a history if infectious mononucleosis compared to individuals that experienced asymptomatic infection24, 25.",

Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) infection induces chronic, demyelinating disease that depends only on the activity of virus-specific T cells rather than the emergence of myelin-specific T cells during the course of infection26. In contrast, TMEV induces CNS autoimmune disease in susceptible mouse strains via bystander activation of myelin antigen-specific CD4 + T cells. Bystander activation is facilitated by myelin damage that occurs during the initial clearance of virus by CD8 + T cells, resulting in presentation of myelin epitopes by APCs to CD4 + myelin antigen-specific T cells that were non-specifically recruited to the CNS. This phenomenon of epitope spreading from viral antigen-specific CD8 + T cells to self-reactive, myelin-specific CD4 + T cells results in a chronic disease resembling MS27. A different mechanism has been demonstrated for recombinant TMEVs encoding either a peptide derived from Haemophilus influenzae sharing six of 13 amino acids with a peptide from proteolipoprotein (PLP)139-151, or a peptide derived from MHV sharing only three amino acids with PLP139-151 (refs. 28, 29) . In these cases, the molecular mimicry between H. influenzae or MHV peptide and PLP peptide is sufficient to prime CD4 + PLP139-151-specific T cells, which then initiate chronic disease. Autoreactive CD8 + T cell clones have also been isolated from mice infected with the DA strain of TMEV, and these clones induce CNS pathology upon adoptive transfer into uninfected mice30. However, the self-antigen recognized by these CD8 + T cell clones has not been identified. Infection with Semliki Forest virus (SFV) also induces an inflammatory, demyelinating disease in the CNS in which both virus-specific T cells and antibodies are generated that cross-react with myelin epitopes31.",

Vac-MBP triggers autoimmunity in Rag2 \u2212/\u2212 8.8 mice by a mechanism analogous to molecular mimicry in that an epitope encoded by the virus is specifically recognized by the MBP-specific TCR. The context of viral infection was important to break the tolerance that is normally maintained in vivo when the 8.8 TCR engages endogenous MBP ligand as immunization with MBP79-87 in CFA was not sufficient to induce disease in 8.8 mice. This result differs from findings in a CD8 + PLPspecific TCR transgenic mice in which neurological signs could be induced by immunization with PLP peptide14. The clinical signs induced by PLP immunization were very mild and CD4 + T cell activity was required for further disease progression and relapses. The differences in the requirement for CD4 + T cells and the severity of disease seen in this model compared to our model may reflect differences in the tolerance mechanisms that allow the PLP-specific and the MBP-specific 8.8 T cells to circulate in the periphery as na\u00efve T cells. Furthermore, CD4 + T cell help is not required to activate na\u00efve CD8 + T cells during a viral infection. Administration of LPS and agonistic anti-CD40 also did not induce disease in 8.8 mice, even though this method of activating APCs presenting endogenous MBP breaks tolerance in some CD4 + MBP-specific TCR transgenic T cells32. Mild disease was induced by co-administration of MBP peptide with LPS and agonistic anti-CD40, indicating that the epitope stripping that normally maintains 8.8 T cell tolerance can be overcome when there is both wide-spread activation of APCs and an increase in the concentration of the MBP ligand. These conditions are achieved more efficiently with Vac-MBP infection, accounting for the stronger ability of Vac-MBP infection to induce disease in 8.8 mice compared to co-administration of MBP peptide with LPS plus the CD40 antibody.",

            "text": "These findings suggest a new perspective on the proposed virally induced etiology of MS that is consistent with the inability to detect infectious virus in the CNS. As the frequency of T cells co-expressing a myelin-specific and a virus-specific TCR in the peripheral T cell repertoire should be low, and will likely vary among individuals, this mechanism may represent one way by which a common infection can trigger autoimmunity in a small subset of genetically predisposed individuals. The cumulative data regarding a connection between EBV infection and MS is consistent with this hypothesis. Despite the association of MS with increasing serum titers of EBNA-1 antibodies22 and with increased frequency of EBVspecific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells21}, the evidence for association of lytic EBV replication with MS is controversial. A recent study reported an almost 100% incidence of EBV infection in CNS B cells in MS patients, as well as viral reactivation in B cells present in CNS follicles accompanied by accumulation of activated CD8 + T cells47, implicating reactivation of EBV as a key factor in MS pathogenesis. However, the detection of EBV DNA in the CNS of MS patients was not reproduced in another study using highly sensitive techniques48, suggesting that the function of EBV as a risk factor for MS is not dependent on reactivation of the virus during autoimmune disease. This notion is consistent with our conclusion that viral infection can activate T cells expressing dual TCRs, one specific for a viral epitope and one for a myelin epitope, that then drive the autoimmune process independent of an ongoing immune response against the pathogen. The low probability of this event may account not only for the low incidence of autoimmunity among individuals infected with one common pathogen, but for the elevated antibody titers in MS patients for several other common viruses21.",

(a) Mbp +/+ 8.8, Mbp \u2212/\u2212 8.8, and wild-type mice (7-11 mice/group) were infected with Vac-MBP or wildtype vaccinia virus on day 0. Mice were weighed daily and the percent weight loss relative to day 0 is shown. The difference in weight loss is significant between MBP +/+ 8.8 and either Mbp \u2212/\u2212 8.8 (P <0.0001) or wild-type mice (P <0.001) infected with wild-type vaccinia virus. Data are compiled from three independent experiments. (b) Splenocytes from 8.8 na\u00efve or wild-type vaccinia virus-infected mice (seven days post-infection) were stained with MBP79-87-H-2K k tetramer and antibodies specific for CD8, CD44, and CD62L. Flow cytometry analyses are gated on CD8 + cells. Down-regulation of MBP79-87-H-2K k tetramer staining routinely occurs on activated 8.8 T cells. (c) 8.8 na\u00efve or wild-type vaccinia virus-infected mice (seven days post-infection) were injected with equal numbers of wild-type splenocytes pulsed with MBP79-87 peptide (CFSE-bright) and non-pulsed (CFSE-dim). Mice were sacrificed 20 h later and CFSE-labeled cells analyzed by flow cytometry. Data are representative of two experiments. (d) Mononuclear CNS cells isolated from Mbp +/+ 8.8 and Mbp \u2212/\u2212 8.8 mice seven days post infection with wild-type vaccinia virus were stained with MBP79-87/H-2K k tetramer and anti-CD8.",
