We compared the performance of the AdvanSure assay with the Seeplex RV 12 ACE detection kit (Seeplex; Seegene, Seoul, South Korea), a multiplex end-point PCR assay. A total of 454 consecutive respiratory specimens were tested with both AdvanSure and Seeplex assays; AdvanSure detected 153 (33.7%) positive cases and Seeplex detected 145 (31.9%) positive cases. The positive percent agreement, negative percent agreement, and kappa value for the two assays were 87.2% (95% CI, 80.3-92.1), 91.1% (95% CI, 87.2-93.9), and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.70-0.83), respectively. Compared with the Seeplex assay, the AdvanSure assay had a shorter turnaround time (3 h vs. 8 h) and a shorter hands-on time (<1 h vs 2 h). In conclusion, the AdvanSure assay demonstrated comparable performance to the Seeplex assay.",

By screening for a variety of pathogens at the same time, nucleic acid-based multiplex assays are able to simultaneously detect a panel of viruses and shorten the hands-on time (HOT), turnaround time (TAT), and length of hospital stay compared to those of traditional methods (Boivin et al., 2004; Cho et al., 2013; Gharabaghi et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2013; Renaud et al., 2012) .",

Extracted nucleic acids were then amplified and probed for RVs with the AdvanSure kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 5 l of extracted DNA was added to a tube containing 5 l of primer probe mix and 10 l of one-step RT-PCR premix. For the reverse transcription step, this mixture was incubated at 50 \u2022 C for 10 min. Denaturation followed at 95 \u2022 C for 30 s, then 10 cycles of PCR (15 s at 95 \u2022 C, 30 s at 53 \u2022 C, and 30 s at 60 \u2022 C).

There were 3, 65, and 3 true positive samples for PIV 2, HRV, and CoV 229E/NL63, respectively. For PIV 2 and CoV 229E/NL63, the lowest agreement was likely due to the low number of target virus-positive specimens. For HRV, the sensitivity and the negative predictive value of the AdvanSure assay (73.8% and 95.8%) were lower than those of the Seeplex assay (84.6% and 97.4%), while vice versa for the specificity and the positive predictive value: 98.5% and 88.9% for the AdvanSure assay vs. 97.9% and 87.3% for the Seeplex assay, albeit without statistical significance. Cho et al. (2014) reported that the AdvanSure assay had exquisite performance for RV detection when compared with the RV15 assay. For the AdvanSure assay, they used the TANBead \u00ae Smart LabAssist-32 DNA extraction system as in this study, and reported a sensitivity of 95.1%, which was higher than the result of this study (91.6%). The Seeplex assay system had a significant drawback regarding its internal control facility. The artificial targets included in each PCR mastermix can only validate the PCR step, not the RNA extraction or reverse transcription step (Bibby et al., 2011) . On the contrary, the AdvanSure assay targets the human RNP gene as an internal control and quantifies it in each sample, which enables monitoring of the RNA extraction and the reverse transcription steps along with the specimen quality (Cho et al., 2013; Dreier et al., 2005) . Monitoring the specimen quality by using an endogenous internal control is important because it could prevent misjudgment from sampling error. In other words, with the results presented as negative in the Seeplex assay, it is impossible to distinguish negative from invalid as opposed to the AdvanSure assay.",

The AdvanSure assay is a one-step real-time PCR assay in which the reverse transcription and multiplex PCR steps are both conducted in the same reaction well. The advantages of the one-step assay over the two-step assay include improved workflow, reduction in assay preparation time, and elimination of cross contamination from the transfer of cDNA from the reverse transcription reaction into the PCR reaction. These factors can play a role in improving the workflow speed for the AdvanSure assay. In our study, TAT and HOT were calculated on the condition that we perform both AdvanSure and Seeplex assays with 16 clinical samples (80 reactions for AdvanSure assay) in one batch. The AdvanSure assay, which is comprised of five reaction tubes, has definitive strengths in workload when compared with the Seeplex assay comprised of two reaction tubes. However, by reducing the number of reaction tubes to four in the AdvanSure assay, it would be possible to lessen the workload as well as facilitate medium to high throughput workloads more effectively.",
