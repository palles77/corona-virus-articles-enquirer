Specific primers for each of the 3 RNA viruses, North American genotype porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and swine influenza virus, were used in the testing procedure. The assay was shown to be highly sensitive because it could detect as little as 10 -5 ng of each of the respective amplicons in a single sample containing a composite of all 3 viruses. The assay was also effective in detecting one or more of the same viruses in various combinations in specimens, including lymph nodes, lungs, spleens, and tonsils, collected from clinically ill pigs and in spleen specimens collected from aborted pig fetuses. The results from the multiplex RT-PCR were confirmed by virus isolation. The relative efficiency (compared to the efficiency of separate assays for each virus) and apparent sensitivity of the multiplex RT-PCR method show that this method has potential for application in routine molecular diagnostic procedures.",

The causative agent is the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a member of the arteriviruses -a group of small, enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses. PRRSV isolates can be classified into 2 distinct genotypes, North American (NA) and European (EU), with VR-2332 and Lelystad virus (LV) being the prototype viruses of the 2 genotypes, respectively. To date, all the PRRSV strains isolated in China have been characterized as the NA genotype. PRRSV infections are characterized by immunosuppression, which results in combined infections or secondary infections with the swine influenza virus (SIV), porcine pseudorabies virus and porcine circovirus type 2. van Reeth et al. (1996) found that the clinical effects of PRRSV were exacerbated in concurrent infection with SIV. Although various subtypes of influenza viruses have been reported to infect swine populations in various countries, H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 have been identified in all countries.",

            "text": "Under the typical conditions of intensive swine farming, the animals may often show simultaneous infection with 2 or more viral pathogens (Ogawa et al. 2009 ). Owing to the variable clinical signs of multiple viral infections and the consequent difficulty in the selection of the most appropriate testing method, a definitive diagnosis in the presence of multiple infections is often difficult. In several previous studies, multiplex PCR (mPCR) (Edward and Gibbs 1994) has been used to identify simultaneously and differentiate multiple viruses in a single sample on the basis of the amplicon sizes (Bel\u00e1k and Thor\u00e9n 2001; Bel\u00e1k 2005) . This ability of mPCR can facilitate the screening of \"panels of pathogens\" in a sample in which the targeted organisms are grouped on the basis of the clinical symptoms and relevance (Bel\u00e1k and Thor\u00e9 2001) . In May 2006, a highly pathogenic PRRSV that causes continuous high fever and a high proportion of deaths in vaccinated pigs of all ages emerged and is prevalent in mainland China since then. Porcine reproductive disorders caused by other pathogens like SIV and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) have also been reported occasionally. Therefore, we developed and evaluated a multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (multiplex RT-PCR) assay for the simultaneous detection of nucleic acids from 3 RNA swine viruses, namely, PRRSV, SIV and JEV. JEV 53-S strain was purchased from the Beijing Ordinary Microbiology Strain Store Center, Beijing, China, and was propagated in the PK-15 porcine kidney cell line. The PRRSV VR-2332 strain was gifted by Dr Yang Hanchun (China Agricultural University, China) and was propagated in the Marc-145 cell line. These viruses were used as standard viruses for the multiplex RT-PCR and maintained at -70\u00b0C until analysis. Uninfected PK-15, Marc-145 cell line, allantoic fluids, and classical swine fever virus (CSFV) were also used in the specificity assays.",

The primers were selected using the Primer Premier software (ver. 5.0) and were based on a highly conserved sequence within the NP region of the SIV genome. A primer pair specific to the ORF6 gene of PRRSV was designed to detect PRRSV. JEV was detected by identifying the nucleotide sequence of the conserved region of the E gene. The primer sequences for the detection of PRRSV and JEV were obtained using the PrimerSelect program in the DNAStar 5.0 software (DNAStar Inc.). The PCR primer pairs for each target gene and the size of each amplicon are summarized in Table 1. 25-L volumes.

            "text": "Generally, the development of a multiplex RT-PCR assay is difficult. The optimization of a multiplex reaction requires adjustments in the concentrations of reagents, annealing temperature, and/or cycling conditions to obtain the best protocol for amplification of more than one target sequence. Such adjustments may contribute to the selection of less than optimal conditions for some primers (Henegariu et al. 1997) . The most common problem is that some of the primers used in the same reaction tube may interact with each other, thereby blocking the reaction (Elnifro et al. 2000) . However, the observed variability among viruses in a multiplex reaction is probably the result of primer design. Indeed, different primers can significantly alter the sensitivity of a multiplex RT-PCR, and in some instances, changing the sequence of a primer by even a few base pairs can have a dramatic effect on the sensitivity of the assay. The identification of primer sets that exhibit equal sensitivity for all their target sequences in a multiplex assay would require extensive testing. Another problem may be the reliable identification of the various RT-PCR products. To overcome these problems, we performed a very careful primer selection in the present study; this procedure yielded amplified products that could clearly be differentiated by agarose gel electrophoresis. One of the main steps in setting up the single-step multiplex RT-PCR protocol was the use of an enzyme mixture containing hot-start DNA polymerase. Because the template could be RNA genomes, and the first step of reverse transcription had to be performed at a low temperature, the use of a hotstart Taq DNA polymerase was essential to avoid nonspecific amplifications caused by primer annealing at a low temperature.",

However, by the virus isolation method, PRRSV, SIV and JEV were detected in 20, 12 and 4 samples, respectively. There are two reasons as to why the result of multiplex PCR was not in agreement with that of virus isolation method: First, PCR assay is highly sensitive and second, there is no established gold standard for the comparison between the results of multiplex PCR and virus isolation. Because of its high experimental requirements, PCR can frequently provide false-positive results and is thereby not entirely appropriate for application outside the laboratory.",
