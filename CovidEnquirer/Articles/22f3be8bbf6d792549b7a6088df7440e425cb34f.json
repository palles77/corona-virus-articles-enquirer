Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is the host receptor by 2019-nCov to infect human cells. Although ACE2 is reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung. 2019-nCoV may use co-receptors/auxiliary proteins as ACE2 partner to facilitate the virus entry. To identify the potential candidates, we explored the single cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single cell coexpression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins.",

Intriguingly, we found that the candidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4 and ENPEP. Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known receptors for human CoVs, suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs. We also conducted \"CellPhoneDB\" analysis to understand the cell crosstalk between CoV-targets and their surrounding cells across different tissues. We found that macrophages frequently communicate with the CoVs targets through chemokine and phagocytosis signaling, highlighting the importance of tissue macrophages in immune defense and immune pathogenesis.",

ENPEP regulates blood pressure regulation and blood vessel formation through the catabolic pathway of the renin-angiotensin system [26] . The relationship between ENPEP and viral infection is unknown. DPP4, the receptor of MERS-CoV, shows expression similarity with ACE2, except that DPP4 expresses in some T cells of all the observed tissues ( Figure S3 & Figure S4 ). All of the three genes encode peptidase, which are uniquely adopted by coronavirus as their receptors [27] . This result raised the possibility that ENPEP may be another yet unknown receptor for coronavirus. To further consolidate the findings, we calculated the Euclidean distance between all the curated proteins and constructed their hierarchy relationships across the 119 cell types. DPP4 was the first gene clustered with ACE2.",

The expression profiles of ACE2 across different cell types of different organs will reveal clues of the virus transmission routes and its potential pathogenesis. In previous studies, ACE2 was found to express in the esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells, absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon, alveolar type II cells in lung, liver cholangiocyte and kidney proximal tubules [5] [6] [7] . These findings suggested that the clinical symptoms of hepatic failure, respiratory injury, acute kidney injury or diarrhoea may be associated with the pervasive ACE2 expressing cells in these tissues. However, we and others found that ACE2 is lowly expressed, especially in the lung (the main target organ of nCoVs), raising the possible existence of coreceptors facilitating nCoV infection. It is well recognized that ssRNA viruses tend to have multiple receptors [9] . For example, ACE2, CD209 (Dendritic Cell-Specific ICAM-3-Grabbing Non-Integrin 1), CLEC4G (C-type lectin domain family 4 member G) and CLEC4M (C-type lectin domain family 4 member M) are receptors of SARS-CoV [31] [32] [33] [34] . In addition, other membrane proteins may also assist virus entry [3] . Since the viral receptor and co-receptors should be co-expressed on the same cell types, we analyzed single cell co-expression patterns covering 400 membrane proteins and 51 known viral receptors in this study. After calculating their gene expression similarity, we found ANPEP, ENPEP and DPP4 are top three genes correlated with ACE4 (R>0.8). Interestingly, both ANPEP and DPP4 are viral receptors of human coronaviruses [35] , while ENPEP is also a peptidase, despite that its involvement in virus infection is unclear. For mysterious reasons, human coronaviruses use peptidases as their receptors [27] . Now, we showed co-expression profiles of these molecules, indicating that different human CoVs actually target the similar cell types across different human tissues. It also explains why,patients infected with different human CoVs manifest similar clinical ",

These cell types consist of macrophages, Alveolar Type 2 cells (AT2), monocytes, NK&T cells, ciliated cells, basal cells, mast cells, neutrophils, Alveolar Type 1 cells (AT1), fibroblasts, endothelial cells, lymphatic cells and B cells. Among them, ~31% cells are alveolar cells (AT2 and AT1) and ~54% cells are immune cells (B cells, T cells and Myeloid cells). Ileum, rectum, esophagus, colon, and stomach are part of digestive system. In esophagus, 7 cell types were identified (Figure S2). Keratinocytes show the highest percentage (~66%) of . The remaining cells are B cells, epithelial basal cells, glands cells, stroma cells, T cells and vessel cells. We detected 11 cell types in stomach (Figure S2), in which epithelial cells (~29%) and pit mucous cell (PMCs) (~23%) constitute the largest group. Besides, B cells, endothelial cells (ECs), enteroendocrine cells, fibroblasts, antral basal gland mucous cell (GMCs), macrophages, neck-like cells, proliferative cell (PCs) and T cells were identified in stomach. In ileum (Figure S2), 7 cell types, including enterocytes (ECs), enteroendocrine cells (EECs), goblet cells (Gs), Paneth cells (PCs), progenitor cells (PROs), stem cells (SCs), transient amplifying (TAs), were annotated. Enterocytes are the largest cell population (~64%) in ileum. Rectum share cell types with ileum. Whereas, the largest cell population in rectum is progenitor cells (~37%). A total of 9 cell types was detected in colon (Figure S2). The percentage of colonocytes (colonocytes and crypt top colonocytes) is 53%, which constitute the largest cell population in colon. BEST4+ cells, enteroendocrine cells (EECs), goblet cells, innate lymphoid cells, mast cells, T cells and undifferentiated cells were also identified. Liver, spleen and skin play vital roles in immune systems. Immune cells (~45%) and hepatocyte (~42%) account for the vast majority of cells in liver (Figure S2). Cholangiocytes, endothelial cells and erthyroid cells were also detected. Spleen is the immune organs in human body, in which all the cells are immune cells (Figure S2). Spleen composed of a large proportion of T cells (~33%) and B cells (~43%). Other immune cells, including CD34 progenitor cells, cDCs, dividing cells, innate lymphoid cells, macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, NK cells and pDCs, also make up the spleen cell populations. Skin is a physical barrier against the external environment. We identified a total of 7 cell populations in skin (Figure S2), in which pericytes (~31%) and fibroblasts (~21%) are the most enriched populations. The immune cells, comprising T cells and myeloid cells were also identified. In addition, basal cells, endothelium cells, and suprabasal keratinocyte constitute the skin cell populations. The kidneys are the part of urinary system that makes urine. Most of the cells in kidney are proximal tubule cells (Proximal Ts) (~82%) (Figure S2). Besides, we also annotated immune cells (~8%), collecting duct intercalated cells (Collecting DIs), collecting duct principal cells (Collecting DPs), distal tubule cells (Distal Ts) and glomerular parietal epithelial cells (Glomerular PEs) in kidney.",

MIF, macrophage migration inhibitory factor, is a pro-inflammatory cytokine participating in inflammatory and immune responses. Besides, PROs, SCs and TAs show high activity responding to the ACE2-expressing cells in ileum and rectum. In colon, ILCs were found frequently interacted with the ACE2-expressing cells. Glomerular parietal epithelial cells and epithelial basal cells in kidney and esophagus also correlated with the cells transcribing ACE2 at very high frequency. We conclude that the nCoV-targeted cells (ACE2-expressing), can interact with various cell types in different tissues, especially macrophages in lung, liver and stomach. Macrophages may be recruited by nCoV-targeted cells through CD74-MIF interaction and other signaling pathways during infection, play defensive and destructive functions.",

We propose that further experimental validations should be performed to explore the role of these peptidase in 2019-nCoV and other CoVs infection.Host immune response plays crucial roles in the fight against viruses. Generally, virally infected cells release interferons to suppress viral activities[36][37][38].The interferons also act on warning the neighboring cells of virus attack. It can signify the the nearby cells to upregulate MHC class I molecules to notify the CD8 + T cells to identify and eliminate the viral infection[39, 40]. Understand the potential cell-cell communication mechanisms across different tissues is important for understanding immune reactions. In this study, we investigated the cells communicated with CoVs-targets (ACE2-expressing cells) in each tissue. Our results illustrate that macrophages frequently crosstalk with the ACE2-expressing cells, in lung, liver and stomach etc. This suggests that macrophages play the sentinel role during human CoVs infection. Future studies should investigate these signaling pairs in the setting of CoVs infection in patients and animal models.",
