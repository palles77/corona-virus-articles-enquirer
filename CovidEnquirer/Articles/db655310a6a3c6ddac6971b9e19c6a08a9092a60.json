            "text": "Housing preweaned dairy calves in pairs rather than individually has been found to positively affect behavioral responses in novel social and environmental situations, but concerns have been raised that close contact among very young animals may impair their health. In previous studies, the level of social contact permitted in individual housing has been auditory, visual, or physical contact. It is unclear how these various levels of social contact compare with each other and to pair housing, when their effects on behavior and health are considered, and whether the timing of pair housing has an effect. To investigate this, 110 Holstein calves (50 males, 60 females) in 11 blocks were paired according to birth date. Within 60 h of birth, each pair of calves was allocated to 1 of 5 treatments: individual housing with auditory contact (I), individual housing with auditory and visual contact (V), individual housing with auditory, visual, and tactile contact (T), pair housing (P), or individual housing with auditory and visual contact the first 2 wk followed by pair housing (VP). At 6 wk of age, calves were subjected to a social test and a novel environment test. In the social test, all pair-housed calves (P and VP) had a shorter latency to sniff an unfamiliar calf than did individually housed calves (I, V, and T), whereas calves with physical contact (T, P, and VP) sniffed the unfamiliar calf for longer than calves on the remaining treatments (I and V). In the novel environment test, calves with physical contact (T, P, and VP) had a lower heart rate, and more of these calves vocalized during the test compared with calves without physical contact (I and V). No effect of treatment was found for clinical scores, levels of the 5 most common pathogens in feces, or in development of serum antibodies against the 3 most common respiratory pathogens. Calves housed individually are more fearful of unfamiliar calves than are pair-housed calves. Contrary to common belief, the allowance of physical contact and pair housing had no effects on the health of the calves.",

            "text": "Providing social contact to preweaned dairy calves by housing them in pairs or small groups rather than individually positively affects their behavior. Pair-housed calves approach and sniff another calf more readily than individually housed calves, whereas individually housed calves forcefully push other calves once social interaction is initiated (Duve and Jensen, 2011; De Paula Vieira et al., 2012) . This indicates less ability to regulate social interactions among individually housed calves and is likely due to limited social experience. In novel environments, individually housed calves respond more fearfully, involving an elevated heart rate (Jensen et al., 1997) . Furthermore, the inability to perform social behaviors may be the cause of abnormal behavior such as excessive licking of their own bodies and fixtures seen in individually housed calves (Bokkers and Koene, 2001) . Finally, social housing of preweaned calves has resulted in higher intakes of concentrate (De Paula Vieira et al., 2010) and hay (Hepola et al., 2006) compared with calves in individual housing. However, individual housing may vary in regard to the level of social contact possible. In some types of individual housing, tactile contact between neighboring calves is possible, whereas in others, calves can see but not touch each other. In some cases, when calves are housed in closed individual pens or hutches with no calves placed opposite, they merely have auditory contact with conspecifics. The first aim of the study was to investigate the effect of level of social contact on calf behavior. We hypothesize that a higher level of social contact would result in a lower fear response to novel environments and unfamiliar calves, a lower level of abnormal behavior in the home environment, and a higher intake of concentrate. Under semi-natural conditions, calves stayed in the proximity of their dams for the first weeks of life (Lidfors and Jensen, 1988) , whereas under production conditions, stronger bonds were formed among calves that were paired at birth rather than later (Duve and Jensen 2011) . Therefore, an additional social treatment, where calves were pair-housed from the age of 2 wk, was included to investigate whether postponing pair housing until this age affected the aforementioned behavioral responses.",

            "text": "Normal development of behavior is one concern for animal welfare, and animal health is another. It may make sense to limit the level of social contact among calves to limit direct horizontal transmission of pathogens. In support of this, Gulliksen et al. (2009) found a higher mortality for calves housed in groups before the age of 1 mo compared with individually housed calves; moreover, calves that had been individually housed preweaning had a lower risk of respiratory disease after weaning compared with calves that had been housed in groups (Svensson et al., 2006) . On the other hand, Svensson et al. (2003) showed that preweaned calves housed in small groups had a lower incidence of respiratory disease than calves housed in large groups or in individual pens, suggesting that the adverse effects of group housing on health is a question of group size rather than of social contact per se. Few studies have compared health among calves with varying levels of contact in individual pens or in pair housing, and thus evidence is scarce as regards the health effects of avoiding tactile contact between calves. The second aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of the level and timing of social contact on calf health.",

Clinical scorings focused on the most prevalent disease syndrome in Danish calves (enteric and respiratory diseases) and were conducted by 1 trained technician on a fixed day of the week when the calf was 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 wk old and included the following: (a) Feces score after stimulation to defecate (0 = firm, 1 = mush-like, 2 = gruel-like, or 3 = watery); (b) breathing (0 = unhindered, 1 = difficult, or 2 = very difficult); (c) nasal discharge (0 = absence, 1 = presence); (d) coughing (0 = absence, 1 = presence); and (e) navel infection (0 = absence, 1 = presence). We observed no cases of navel infection. Because we observed no cases of very difficult breathing, breathing score was a binary variable (unhindered or difficult). A novel score (\"respiratory score') was constructed from the combined scores for breathing, nasal discharge, and coughing. The respiratory score was set to 1 if at least one of following was scored: difficult breathing, presence of nasal discharge, or presence of coughing; otherwise, it was set to zero. There were few observations of fecal scores 2 and 3; therefore, fecal score was converted into a binary variable: fecal consistency was set to zero if original scores were equal to zero and to 1 if original scores were above zero (scores 1, 2, and 3).",

The treatments were defined to include an increasing level of social contact from only auditory contact over visual and tactile contact to full social contact in the pair pens. The study showed an effect of this increasing level of social contact on social responses during the social test; the latency to sniff the unfamiliar calf decreased, whereas the duration of sniffing the unfamiliar calf's muzzle increased with increasing level of social contact. In the social test, the stimulus calf was tethered to control its responses and to give the test calf the initiative in a standardized way. Jensen et al. (1997) and Duve and Jensen (2011) also found that individually housed calves were more reluctant to interact socially when they had to take the initiative during a test with a stimulus calf positioned in a specific place, whereas individually housed calves responded more aggressively to other calves' proximity and social investigation when these calves were loose (Veissier et al., 1994; Duve and Jensen, 2011; De Paula Vieira et al., 2012) . In commercial settings, calves are typically weaned and grouped around the age of 6 to 8 wk. A high level of activity and agonistic behavior at grouping in previously individually housed calves is likely a disturbance in this situation, and it may interfere with the feeding transition from milk to solids, as De Paula Vieira et al. (2010) found that pair-housed calves consumed more concentrate after weaning and grouping than did calves that had previously been housed individually. Calves' social responses may become more flexible as they gain social experience later in life. In the present study, no effect of calf age at pair housing was seen, which sug-gests that the first 2 wk were not essential for calves' social responses at 6 wk of age. Also, found little effect on social responses of housing calves together from birth compared with housing them together from 3 wk of age when calves were tested at 5 to 7 wk of age. On the other hand, when tested at 26 wk of age, calves that had been group-housed from 5 d to 12 wk performed more social behaviors than calves that had been individually housed in this period (Jensen et al., 1999) , and a long-term effect of the social environment from birth to 3 mo of age has been found in calves reared by the dam (Wagner et al., 2012) . Possible long-term effects of social contact to peers in preweaned calves deserve further investigation.",

Similarly to pair-housed calves, more calves with tactile contact vocalized when isolated in a novel environment. This might suggest that these calves were more affected by separation from their peer. On the other hand, these calves also had a lower heart rate during this test, which does not support an increased emotional response but rather suggests that calves housed with tactile contact and pair-housed calves were actively trying to reestablish contact with their peers. During the novel environment test, heart rate was not affected by areas entered (and thus not physical activity) and the higher heart rate in individually housed calves without physical contact is thus more likely to relate to a higher emotional response than to physical activity. Also similarly to pair-housed calves, individually housed calves with tactile contact sniffed the unfamiliar calf's muzzle more. However, all individually housed calves were more hesitant to approach an unfamiliar calf in the social test, suggesting that individually housed calves with tactile contact were more fearful of unfamiliar calves than were pair-housed calves. Thus, compared with isolation, individual housing with tactile contact reduced calves' fearfulness, but pair housing reduced fearfulness even more. This suggests that compared with isolation, tactile contact improves calf welfare, but pair housing improves it 5043 even more. This is of relevance to European legislation, which states that individually housed calves must be able to see and touch neighboring calves.",

The incidence and severity of disease is influenced by the animal itself; its environment and management; and the presence, level, and transmission of infectious agents. The ability of a young calf to cope with especially enteric pathogens relies on a few key factors: (1) immunoglobulin (mainly IgG), absorbed from the colostrum during the first 24 h and re-secreted into the lumen; (2) local-acting immunoglobulin (IgA and IgG) supplied in subsequent milk feedings; (3) the ability of the calf to mount an effective immune response; and (4) the infection pressure (i.e., the risk of the calf being exposed to a pathogen). The health evaluation constituted clinical scoring and pathogen exposure assessed by laboratory tests for the most common calf pathogens. For respiratory viruses, paired serum samples were used as an indicator of infection. Bovine rotavirus and Eimeria spp. were the most common pathogens detected in the examined calves, with 50 and 18% of the calves being positive in \u22651 sample, respectively, whereas BCV and C. parvum were detected less frequently. These findings are in accordance with findings in similar studies and reflect the age of the calves (Reynolds et al., 1986; de Verdier Klingenberg and Svensson, 1998) . Only 2% of the calves had a fecal score of zero at all 5 observations, which emphasizes that loose feces is a common feature in young calves, irrespective of housing conditions. The frequent detection of BRV and Eimeria spp. in the fecal samples indicates that these pathogens may have contributed to loose feces. However, no treatment effects on fecal scoring were detected and no differences in prevalence of the pathogens were seen between the treatment groups.",
