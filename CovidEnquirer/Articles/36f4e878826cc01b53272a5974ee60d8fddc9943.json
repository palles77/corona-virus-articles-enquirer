Using cumulative skew diagrams, I found that mutational patterns in the SARS-CoV genome were strikingly different from other coronaviruses in terms of mutation rates, although they were in general agreement with the model of the coronavirus lifecycle. These findings might be relevant for the development of sequence-based diagnostics and the design of agents to treat SARS.",

In this paper, these parts are referred to as the long and short arm, respectively. Strikingly, there is a change in behavior of the cumulative skew diagram at the border of the arms in all coronaviruses sequenced to date (six representatives are shown in Figure 1 ), indicating a lower GC skew on the short arm. This behavior suggests that biological processes that distinguish the two arms (Box 2) are responsible for the mutational pattern, rather than the fidelity of the replication machinery; the latter not would result in a constant slope of cumulative skew, as is the case in retroviruses [3] . The mutation rates (as indicated by the extent of the cumulative skew on the y-axis) do not appear to depend on a host organism: skews are similar in murine, avian and human 229E coronaviruses (Figure 1c ,e,f) but substantially lower in SARS-CoV ( Figure 1a , Table 1 ).",

On the cumulative GC skew plot Figure Ib these polarity switches are seen to correspond to local minima and maxima on the GC diagram.

            "text": "The same rules apply to the analysis of RNA viral genomes. For example, for plus-strand RNA viruses the events taking place on the minus strand can be taken into account in much the same way as is done for the second strand of dsDNA. Because GC skew measures the level of cytosine depletion on one strand relative to its complementary strand, changes in the diagram shape enable researchers to infer the contribution of processes occurring on both strands, even in taxonomical orders of single-stranded viruses. The intracellular duplex of minus-gRNA with plus-gRNA protects them from cytosine deamination. If the first stage of transcription, which involves subgenomic mRNA template synthesis from the plus-gRNA, leaves minus-gRNA on the short arm as a single strand (Box 2, Figure I ), then cytosine deamination will lead to the accumulation of uracils on minus-gRNA. Subsequently, synthesis of the new viral plus-gRNA from minus-gRNA will propagate these mutations, depleting guanines and decreasing the overall GC skew on the short arm of the plus strand. This explanation concurs with the model of subgenomic mRNA synthesis from minus-strand subgenomic RNA templates [9, 10] , for which there is experimental evidence in arteviruses [11] and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) [12] . The rate of cytosine deamination that is related to sgmRNA synthesis is likely to be proportional to the difference between the slopes of the curves in the long and short arms (Table 1) . Such a combination of mutational pressures for the two RNA strands indicates a higher overall substitution rate for the short arm, compared with the long arm. The supporting evidence for this comes from the comparison of two bovine coronaviruses (respiratory and enteric) that have differences in 107 nucleotide positions [13] . More than 80% of these differences correspond to the third base of a codon, indicating mutational pressure. I analyzed the distribution of these 107 positions and found that 59 of them localized to the short arm, suggesting an , 2.5-fold increase in polymorphisms on that arm. Most of these polymorphisms (85, , 80%) correspond to a C to U [4, 5] , (b) enteric bovine coronavirus (BCoV) [13] , (c) murine hepatitis virus (MHV) [14] , (d) porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) [17] , (e) human coronavirus (229E) [18] and (f) avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) [19] . Diagrams with the window size of 60 bp were constructed as previously described [1, 7] . Vertical bars mark the end of the replicase polyprotein gene in these genomes. Note the different slopes of the curves to the left and to the right of these vertical bars (which corresponds to the division points between the long and short arms) and the differences in vertical scales on different panels. substitution on one of the strands, further emphasizing the role of cytosine deamination as the primary mutational force in coronaviruses. The rates of cytosine deamination in the SARS-CoV genome appear lower compared with other coronaviruses and this might explain the observation that the two sequenced strains diverged in genomic sequence by , 0.003% [4, 5] . Alternatively, if the epidemic came from a single clone, then only a short time span separates the two strains and that might explain the low divergence. Furthermore, the differences might be sequencing errors or PCR artifacts. However, it is worth pointing out that seven out of these eight polymorphisms also correspond to a C to U substitution on one of the strands.",

The cause is probably not in the host because another human coronavirus (229E) does not appear different from the other viruses examined (Figure 1e ). Could the parameters of the virus-encoded RNA synthesis machinery, such as the speed of replication or transcription, or their relative turnover be responsible for this difference? The level of cytosine deamination, reflected in GC skew, has been hypothesized to depend on the time a DNA strand spends in a single-stranded state [1, 7, 8] (Box 1), and the same is probably true for RNA. Although the relative contribution of transcription in SARS-CoV is similar to that in other coronaviruses (Table 1 , column L-S), the effect of replication is much lower ( Table 1 , column L).

These levels and localization of transcriptional activity are likely to be linked to the difference in mutation rates on the short and long arms (see main text). replication is slower in SARS or their relative turnover is lower compared with the synthesis of subgenomic mRNA template RNA. All these findings are relevant for sequence-based diagnostics and drug design against SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses because targeting the long arm with lower mutation rates should prove more robust against mutational changes in the target. This lends further support to a recent suggestion to design anti-SARS drugs based on the structure of the SARS 3C-like proteinase [15] , which is encoded by genes on the long arm. These anti-SARS drugs will function as protease inhibitors that might block coronavirus replication. Another set of putative targets has been suggested in a recent publication [16] that has identified distant homologs of cellular RNA processing enzymes in the SARS genome. Notably, these are also encoded on the long arm as parts of the replicase polyprotein.",
