We generated specific antibodies against SARS protein 3a by using a synthetic peptide (P2) corresponding to amino acids 261-274 of the putative protein. Anti-P2 antibodies and the sera from SARS patients could specifically detect the recombinant SARS protein 3a expressed in Escherichia coli and in Vero E6 cells. Expression of SARS protein 3a was detected at 8-12 h after infection and reached a higher level after $24 h in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells. Protein 3a was also detected in the alveolar lining pneumocytes and some intra-alveolar cells of a SARS-CoVinfected patient's lung specimen. Recombinant protein 3a expressed in Vero E6 cells and protein 3a in the SARS-CoVinfected cells was distributed over the cytoplasm in a fine punctate pattern with partly concentrated staining in the Golgi apparatus. Our study demonstrates that SARS-CoV indeed expresses a novel protein 3a, which is present only in SARS-CoV and not in other known CoVs.",

The genome of SARS-CoV is 29.7 kb in length and has the same frame of sequence structure as do other CoVs such as the spike glycoprotein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N), which have been identified in SARS-CoV [5] . However, 14 putative open reading frames (ORFs) were identified within the SARS-CoV genome, encoding six known and eight unknown proteins [6, 7] . Theoretically, all of these proteins play a unique and important role as SARS-CoV infection progresses and could serve as targets for addressing the mechanisms and therapeutic developments for this disease. For example, the four structural proteins: the S protein, M protein, N protein, and small E protein have been broadly studied for their important roles in receptor binding, virion budding, and viral life cycle during general processes of viral infection [8, 9] . The gene of ORF 3a (CDS: 25268-26092) is located between the gene of the S glycoprotein (CDS: 21492-25259) and E protein (CDS: 26117-26347) [6, 7] . The minimal transcription regulatory sequence (5 0 -ACGAAC-3 0 ) is also located upstream of ORF 3a (CDS: 25260-25265) [7] . Due to its novelty, we investigated ORF 3a that encodes the putative protein 3a, designated as protein X1 by Rota et al. [4] .",

Protein 3a was a membrane associated protein that was distributed over the cytoplasm in a fine punctate pattern with partly concentrated staining in the Golgi apparatus. In addition, specific antibodies against protein 3a were also present in sera from SARS-CoV-infected patients. Thus, the identification of this novel protein 3a could be the first step toward exploring its role in the SARS infection process and the potential utilization of protein 3a in clinical diagnosis or therapeutic development. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Cloning and expression of protein 3a SARS-CoV total RNA was isolated from SARS-CoV (TW1 strain)-infected Vero E6 cells by a single-step extraction method as described previously [10, 11] . Oligonucleotide primers used for amplification and sequencing of the protein 3a gene were based on the SARS-CoV-TW1 sequence (Accession No. AY291451). Two oligonucleotides based on the N-and C-terminal sequences of the protein 3a gene were synthesized. The sense primer used was 5 0 -AT-GGATTTGTTTATGAGATTTTTTACT-3 0 , encoding the eight Nterminal amino acids (MDLFMRFFT), whereas the antisense primer was 5 0 -CAAAGGCACGCTAGTAGTCGTCGT-3 0 , encoding the C-terminus (TTTTSVPL). The coding sequence of the protein 3a gene was then amplified by PCR, and the amplified product was analyzed by electrophoresis, subcloned into the pSTBlue vector (Novagen, Madison, WI), then transformed into Escherichia coli strain DH5. After transformation, plasmids from positive clones were subjected to sequence analysis by use of an ABI 3100 sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and the dye terminator cycle sequencing FS Ready reaction. For expression of the recombinant protein 3a, the SARS virus protein 3a gene from the pSTBlue construct was inserted into vector pGEX 4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences Inc., Sweden) in frame with the EcoRI restriction enzyme site for expression as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. After being transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI), the fusion protein was expressed by induction with 0.5 mM isopropyl-b-D D -thiogalactopyranoside, for 3 h at 37\u00b0C. For obtaining the pure recombinant protein 3a, the GSTfusion protein was affinity purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B chromatography (Amersham Biosciences Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The recombinant protein 3a was then released from the Sepharose-bound GST moiety by specific digestion with thrombin protease and collected. Briefly, the induced cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer with 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and then sonicated in an ice bath for 1 min. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 20 000 \u00c2 g at 4\u00b0C for 15 min and the pellets were discarded. The supernatant was applied to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column equilibrated with PBS buffer and the column was washed with 10\u00c2 the bed volume of the same buffer. After the GST-fusion SARS protein 3a was bound, the column was incubated with PBS containing 50 units of thrombin at 25\u00b0C for 2 h. The released recombinant protein 3a lacking the GST carrier was eluted with PBS buffer and collected. The protein purity was determined by 12.5% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and visualized with Coomassie blue.",

Using BLAST program analysis [16] , we showed that the Nterminal domain of SARS protein 3a has $29% identity with the putative cytochrome B-561 transmembrane protein from bacteria (Ralstonia solanacearum) and 24% identity with the opsin fragments from the hawkmoth (Manduca sexta) and the rhodopsin from the butterfly (Popilio glaucus), as indicated in Fig. 1 . The C-terminus of protein 3a has moderate similarity to the calcium-transporting ATPase (calcium pump) from a parasite (Plasmodium falciparum) and the outer-membrane porin from a bacterium (Shewanella oneidensis), 41% and 27% identity, respectively. However, overall the putative full-length sequence of protein 3a lacks significant similarities to any known proteins. When we used hydrophobicity and polarity analysis programs [17, 18] , there were three regions with low polarity and high hydrophobicity in the N-terminus of the protein 3a sequence. Membrane-spanning regions, predicted by the Dense Alignment Surface method [19] , were located in three sequence segments, amino acids 43-56, 79-97, and 106-116, suggesting that protein 3a may play a role in SARS-CoV interaction with the cellular membrane. Based on bioinformation of this novel protein, we further demonstrate that protein 3a is expressed both in SARS-CoV-infected cells and a SARS-CoV-infected patient's tissue, which is a first step in exploring its role in the SARS-CoV infection process.",

Fig. 5A shows that recombinant protein 3a expressed in Vero E6 cells as well as protein 3a in the SARS-CoV-infected cells was distributed over the cytoplasm in a fine punctate pattern with partly concentrated staining in the Golgi apparatus. Similar immunofluorescence staining of protein 3a was also observed in Vero cells after 6 h of infection with SARS-CoV, however the expression level was lower than that of 24 h (data not shown). Furthermore, by using commercially prepared slides with SARS-CoV-infected cells (Euroimmun Inc., Germany), we showed that the expression of protein 3a was also detected in a punctate pattern with partly concentrated staining in the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 5B , a-f), but not co-localized with endoplasmic reticulum (ER), lysosome, or mitochondria (Fig. 5B, g-o) . The distribution pattern of protein 3a as well as the SARS-CoV M protein was co-localized with the b-COP Golgi apparatus marker protein shown in Fig. 5B , d-f and p-r, respectively. To assess the subcellular distribution of recombinant protein 3a expressed in Vero E6 cells, homogenates were fractionated by differential centrifugation. Membrane (M) and cytosol (C) fractions were separated and protein 3a, calnexin (ER membrane marker), and a-tubulin (cytoplasmic marker) in subcellular fractions were identified by Western blot analysis. Protein 3a was detected in the membrane fraction (Fig. 5C ). Our data demonstrate that SARS-CoV indeed expressed the putative membrane-associated protein 3a in vivo. It is known that the viral membrane proteins, including the major proteins S (spike) and M (membrane), are inserted into the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, whereas full-length replicated RNA (+ strands) , calnexin (ER marker), LAMP-2 (lysosome marker), and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COX 1) (mitochondria marker) in red, and the right panels show overlays of fluorescence images of protein 3a or M protein and the subcellular marker proteins where yellow indicates co-localization of green (protein 3a or M protein) and red (marker proteins) signals. Hoechst 33258 nuclear DNA staining is shown in blue. The confocal fluorescence was visualized by Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 confocal microscope (60\u00c2). (C) Subcellular distribution of protein 3a. Membrane (M), and cytosolic (C) fractions of recombinant protein 3a expressed in Vero E6 were prepared as described in Section 2. Equivalent amounts (from total homogenate, T) of each fraction were analyzed by electrophoresis and immunoblotting using specific antibodies against the P2 peptide of protein 3a, a-tubulin (cytosolic marker), or calnexin (ER membrane marker). Fig. 4 . Immunohistochemical detection of protein 3a in lung section from an SARS-CoV-infected patient. The expression of protein 3a was detected using anti-P2 antibody diluted 1:500 as described in Section 2. Arrowheads indicate protein 3a in the cytoplasm of some pneumocytes (100\u00c2). assembles with the N (nucleocapsid) protein. This RNA protein complex then associates with the M protein embedded in the membranes of the ER and virus particles form as the nucleocapsid complex buds into the ER. The virus then migrates through the Golgi complex and eventually exits from the cell, probably by exocytosis [9, [20] [21] [22] . It is of interest to note that protein 3a was partially co-localized with Golgi marker protein p58 and that the punctate pattern may be the result of protein 3a being a membrane-associated molecule. Whether protein 3a can, like the S and M proteins, play a role in SARS-CoV assembly in the ER-Golgi exocytosis pathway needs to be investigated further.",

            "text": "In conclusion, we have identified and characterized a novel SARS-CoV protein, protein 3a, that lacks significant identity with any known proteins. Recently, based on molecular epidemiology and genome evolution studies of SARS-CoV, Yeh et al. [23] reported that two of the 11 protein-coding regions in the SARS-CoV genome, spike and orf3 (protein 3a), showed a sign of positive selection during virus evolution. Although the function(s) of protein 3a is yet to be known, the spike protein is thought to be of particular importance in the infectious process, based on the studies of other CoVs [24] [25] [26] . The highfrequency mutations or evolution adaptive property of protein 3a implied that its function may be, like spike protein, very important in the virus life cycle and/or disease development. Our findings provide an opportunity to explore protein 3a's function in the SARS-CoV infection process. The SARS-CoV protein 3a may provide insight into the mechanisms of infection of the virus as well as serve as a target for therapeutic developments for this disease, allowing for rapid and rational development and testing of candidate vaccines and therapeutics against this important human pathogen.",
