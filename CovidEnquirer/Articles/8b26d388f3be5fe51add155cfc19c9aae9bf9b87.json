As of March 23, 2016, 1698 laboratoryconfi rmed cases have been reported to WHO. 2 On the basis of previous epidemiological fi ndings, 3 the potential of MERS-CoV to spread to large numbers of people has been considered low, by contrast with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The basic reproductive number of MERS-CoV was estimated to be less than 1\u00b70, suggesting low transmissibility. 4, 5 However, a 2013 outbreak of MERS-CoV infection in Al Hasa, Saudi Arabia, where one patient infected seven other patients in dialysis and intensive care units, 6 raised concerns about potential so-called super-spreaders 7 that were reported during the SARS epidemic. 8, 9 From May to July, 2015, a large outbreak of MERS-CoV infection occurred in South Korea from a traveller returning from the Middle East, which led to 186 confi rmed cases (Patient 1 to Patient 186) in the country. 10 Patient 1 was diagnosed at our hospital (Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, South Korea) after transmitting the virus at several health-care facilities before he came to our hospital. Patient 14 was exposed to Patient 1 outside the hospital and sought additional care at our hospital without knowing he was infected with MERS-CoV. Therefore, we experienced both South Korea's fi rst MERS-CoV case and the case of highest transmission of MERS-CoV following a single patient exposure in an emergency room. We aimed to investigate the epidemiology of MERS-CoV infection in a crowded emergency room outside of the Middle East and the presence of multiple super-spreaders.",

Patients who were admitted to hospital for treatment of their primary illness after exposure in the emergency room were quarantined in private rooms for 14 days from the last exposure or discharged home after treatment was fi nished and continued isolation at home.

Patients' demographic information, underlying disease, dates of emergency room visit, duration of stay with exact arrival and departure times, and location within the emergency room were collected. If radiographic examinations were done, the time of examination was collected. For healthcare workers, age, sex, occupation, history of patient assignments and working or visiting zone, and dates and time of duty or emergency room visits were collected. The attack rate was calculated by dividing the number of confi rmed cases by the total number of exposed individuals in the emergency room in each group. Because the total list of visitors was unavailable, we estimated the number of visitors who were in the emergency room by assuming that one patient had at least one visitor during their stay; we also simulated the scenarios of two and four visitors per patient. To avoid underestimation, we chose the assumption of one visitor per patient, which would give the highest attack rate among the scenarios. The incubation period was defi ned as the time of fi rst exposure to the onset of clinical symptoms of MERS-CoV infections.",

We considered all patients who visited the emergency room during the stay of Patients 1 and 14 as exposed contacts, developed criteria for close contacts by expanding on the defi nitions of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 12 and categorised patients into diff erent groups. Therefore, we could establish group-specifi c viral incubation periods and attack rates during the outbreak. In close contacts who stayed in the same zone, the incubation period was shorter and attack rate was higher than patients who stayed in diff erent zones. Additionally, in zones III and IV, patients were infected even when they were separated by curtains most of the time and were apart as far as 6 m (for beds on either side of the nurse's station; fi gure 4). Similar to the SARS outbreak, we observed so-called superspreaders among patients with MERS-CoV infection, and these super-spreaders can cause large outbreaks through several modes of transmission similar to those in the SARS outbreak. 13 Among patients who stayed in various locations, those who overlapped with Patient 14 at the radiology suite or registration area had higher attack rates (5%) than the rest of the patients (1%), suggesting that transmission might occur by even brief exposures to recently contaminated objects or encounters with individuals carrying a super-spreader.",

No patient developed MERS-CoV infection after exposure on May 29 only to the environment that had been potentially contaminated on May 27 (zone II) and May 28 (zone III) while Patient 14 was confi ned to zone IV on May 29. It is plausible that even if the environment was heavily contaminated by a super-spreader, the virus might not persist long enough in the environment to be capable of causing any new infection. Although patient exposure is clearly the most important factor in the spread of MERS-CoV, more research is needed to address the potential of environmental spread. 14 Increased viral load and larger amounts of respiratory secretions have been suggested as the factors for SARS-CoV super-spreaders. 15, 16 In this MERS outbreak, frequent ambulation of the index case could be considered as one factor related to high levels of viral transmission, in addition to large amounts of respiratory secretions and high viral load (cycle thresholds 18\u00b76 for upE and 19\u00b73 for ORF1a from Patient 1's sputum, 17 and 16\u00b72 for upE and 19\u00b79 for ORF1a from Patient 14's sputum). Of note, Patient 1 infected 28 patients in another hospital but caused no confi rmed secondary cases in our hospital, whereas Patient 14 caused an additional 82 cases in our hospital. The diff erence of transmissibility between these two individuals could be caused by a combination of factors such as the time from onset of disease, clinical symptoms, duration of contact exposure, pattern of behaviour inside and near the emergency room, and kinetics of viral shedding.",
