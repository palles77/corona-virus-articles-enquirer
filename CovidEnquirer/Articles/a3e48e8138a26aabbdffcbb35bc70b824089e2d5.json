Both meetings are organized by the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology (PASCV) and the University of South Florida College of Medicine, and have been put together for two decades by the same group of dedicated people. Like the Workshop, the CVS sessions are characterized by the high quality and focus of the presentations, lively question and answer sessions, and (not least) the same pleasant meeting location in a modest older hotel on a beautiful Gulf of Mexico beach. CVS is distinguished from the Workshop by the addition of posters and exhibits and by the panel discussion format of some of the presentations. A CD with the audio portion of all the lectures and discussions is available from IntelliQuest Media, Inc. (www.intelliquestmedia.com, .",

            "text": "Michael Fried, MD (MF), University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC gave the Fredrich Deinhardt Lectureship, speaking on Hepatitis C Virus: Evolving Guidelines and Paradigms. He cited CDC data indicating that 5% of men and 2.5% of women in the U.S. between 40 and 50 years old are infected, and then described recent therapeutic breakthroughs that result in a 50% cure rate for this otherwise largely chronic infection. Cure is defined as undetectable HCV RNA and normal ALT after 6 months of treatment, as only 1-2% of such patients relapse. Although the reasons for the difference are not understood, it is clear that HCV genotype is a major factor in response to therapy, and thus pre-treatment genotype determination is mandatory. About 70% of U.S. cases are genotype 1, which has a lower average response rate than other genotypes and requires more extensive treatment. MF's studies showed that a two-log reduction in viral load at week 12 of therapy predicted sustained response after 48 weeks of therapy in 65% of patients infected with HCV Genotype 1, whereas failure to achieve a two-log reduction predicted treatment failure in 97%. Thus their current treatment paradigm consists of initial genotype and viral load determination followed by re-test of HCV viral load after 12 weeks of treatment in Genotype 1 patients. If twolog reduction has not been achieved, treatment is stopped. If HCV RNA is undetectable, treatment is continued to 48 weeks without further testing. If HCV RNA is detectable, the test is repeated at 24 weeks of treatment: if at this point HCV RNA is still detectable, treatment is stopped. If HCV RNA is undetectable, treatment is continued to 48 weeks. Patients with Genotype 2 or 3 get 24 weeks of treatment without interim HCV RNA testing, and achieve a 78% sustained response rate. Minimizing treatment duration is important for limiting side effects and for efficient use of resources.",

A third of HIV patients are co-infected with HCV. Their treatment side effects are more pronounced, and they have a 25-35% sustained response rate. If you encounter mixed genotype infections, treat the most resistant genotype. In sustained responders, HCV seems to be cleared even from liver tissues. 50% of children exposed via blood clear HCV spontaneously. Sara Miller, Ph.D. (SM), Duke University Medical Center Durham, NC reported on the detection of viruses in clinical specimens using electron microscopy (EM). First used in the late 1930s, EM is now extensively used in difficult viral diagnosis, and is the gold standard for the detection and identification of new pathogens. EM identified emerging disease agents such as SARS coronavirus, monkeypox virus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus and Ebola virus. In each case the pathogen was unknown and unsuspected and no prior information was required for analysis (as compared to molecular methods).",

EM requires expensive instrumentation and trained personnel, but is still the fastest method to detect viral pathogens, and does not require cultivable agents. SM's lab tests approximately 1000 specimens/year for viruses, 90% in fluids and 10% in cells or solid tissue. Most of the specimens are diarrheal stools from gastroenteritis patients, since there are some enteric viruses that do not grow or grow very slowly in cell culture. EM testing provides an advantage in urine examination for polyomavirus, since most people were exposed to polyomavirus by age 9-10 and are positive for antibodies. SM frequently monitors urine (a non-invasive specimen) from kidney transplant patients, who are prone to contract polyomavirus or may have a reactivation. These viruses can contribute to organ rejection by activating the immune system, and thus increase the requirement for antirejection drugs. The most commonly seen polyomaviruses are BK and JC, which are not cultivable. Currently their detection is possible only by EM. SM found that these viruses are the causative agent for folliculocentric skin infection in immunocompromised hosts.",

            "text": "Christine Ginocchio Ph.D. (CG) North Shore LIJ Center Health System Lab, Lake Success, NY talked about human papillomavirus (HPV) and provided a comprehensive update on HPV diagnostics. The human papillomaviruses belong to the family of papovaviridae and are the causative agents for different warts. HPV was first linked to human cancer in 1980 by Harald zur Hausen (Germany) and recognized by the WHO as a tumor virus and the major cause of cervical carcinoma and adenocarcinoma in 1996. HPV is the most common sexually transmitted agent in males and females, but is also transmitted from mother to child. Estimated incidence of new infections is between 1 and 5.5 million/year in the US. While most infections are spontaneously cleared, 5-10% of women older than 30 years are persistent carriers of HPV. Incidence and mortality has decreased in the U.S. in recent years, with approximately 4000 deaths/year currently due to cervical cancer, making it the third most common cause of cancer in women. Tumor progression is believed to occur in stages from first infection of the basal epithelial cells, to active infection, to sub-clinical latency, and finally advancement to tumor (from benign, to hyperplastic, to pre-malignant and malignant). Progression to cancer from HPV infection occurs due to blocking of the tumor suppressor proteins Rb and p53 through interaction with the HPV proteins E6/E7. The virus may either integrate into host DNA (mostly found in cancers) or is found as an episome (in sub-clinical latency). In 20% of cervical tumors the virus does not integrate. Two hundred HPV genotypes are known, and those associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) have been divided into three categories: unspecified, low risk and high risk. The high risk genotypes with the greatest association with cervical carcinoma are 16 and 18. Of women positive for 16/18, 39% will develop CIN grade 2 or 3 within 2 years.",

The sensitivity of detecting High grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (HSIL) was shown to be enhanced by the addition of HPV DNA testing from 58% (cytology only) to 93% (cytology plus HPV DNA testing). Thus, the U.S. FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved the combination of cervical cytology and HPV DNA testing for primary screening for women aged 30 years and older. Systems for HPV DNA detection include In situ hybridization (Benchmark and INFORM \u00ae HPV system, from Ventana Medical Systems, Tuscon AZ; DAKO GenPoint TM System, Trappes, France; InPath TM Molecular Diagnostics and Invirion, Frankfurt, Germany; the NASBA-based Pre-Tect HPV Proofer, Norchip, Norway); liquid hybridization (Digene Hybrid Capture \u00ae 2 HPV DNA Test), or by various PCR amplification and detection methods (Roche HPV Line Blot, Roche Diagnostics, RUO only and home brew applications, such as HPV ASR (analyte specific reagents)).

The family of the polyomaviridae has 13 known members including 2 human viruses, JCV and BKV, both named by the initials of the persons they were first isolated from. Polyomaviruses found worldwide have a narrow host range, can transform cell lines in culture and can cause tumors in some experimental animals. The small (5.1 kb) ds (double stranded) circular DNA encodes various proteins such the large T antigen, the small t antigen, the agnoprotein and the structural proteins VP1-3. The T antigen plays a crucial functional role through multiple enzymatic activities and interaction with host proteins (see also Hess and Brandner, 1997) . Serological studies have shown that human infection with these viruses occurs during childhood, although the route of transmission is unknown. Seropositivity increases with age. JCV and BKV circulate independently. The virus may persist in various sites of the body including kidneys, brain and lymphocytes, and may reactivate with pregnancy and during immunosuppression. Human diseases such as PML (progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy) are linked to JCV, and BKV has been linked to hemorrhagic cystitis, urethral stenosis and transplant nephropathy, while SV40 may be linked to different brain tumors, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and infection in pediatric kidney transplant recipients. The laboratory diagnosis is based on cell culture (which is not practical), PCR and serology.",

The high replication rate and high transcription error rate that characterize HIV make it a moving target for drug development: statistically, every base in the viral genome mutates to every other possible base every day in an untreated individual. Current drugs target one of two viral enzymes, reverse transcriptase or protease, and one fusion inhibitor was recently approved. Integrase, the third viral enzyme, has been a difficult target. HIV is an enveloped virus, and entry into cells for these involves attachment, receptor engagement, trigger events (pH-dependent or -independent), conformational change and membrane fusion. The trigger event for HIV is its pH-independent engagement with a co-receptor. HIV's receptors are CD4 and co-receptors CCR5 (early) or CXCR4 (later); the switch by the virus from CCR5 to CXCR4 is associated with accelerated disease progression. There is a 32-CCR5 polymorphism that prevents HIV entry into cells and protects homozygotes against HIV infection. This suggests that CCR5 is a good drug target, and inhibitors against it are under development.",

Enfuvirtide is a peptide fusion inhibitor that works at this last step. The addition of entry inhibitors to the list of treatment options means that viral phenotype becomes important; in addition to how much virus, clinicians will need to know what kind of virus is present, i.e., which co-receptors does the virus use? Researchers have also observed that different virus strains and cells from different donors each lead to a much larger variability in potency of entry inhibitors 2-4 orders of magnitude) than the variability seen with other types of HIV drugs (2-to 4-fold). This variation, too, should lead to additional testing requirements when these drugs are available for clinical use. A case could be made that patients taking Enfuvirtide should be genotyped for the CCR5 polymorphism, for instance. RD reviewed mechanism of action studies and sensitivity data for Enfuvirtide and several candidate entry inhibitor drugs, describing virus and host cell factors that affect drug sensitivity and the practical implications of these. Discussion points included the fact that chemokines that are the natural ligands for CCR5 have some protective effect against HIV disease progression, that CXCR4 viruses are less prevalent than CCR5 for reasons that are mysterious, that CD4 expression levels are not infection-rate limiting, but CCR5 levels are, that patients do not make antibody to Enfuvirtide despite being exposed to large amounts of it, that in the presence of CCR5 inhibitors, HIV is evolving to use CCR5 in a different way rather than to use CXCR4 instead, that if the switch from co-receptor use from CCR5 to CXCR4 does take place, it will kill the usefulness of fusion inhibitors, and that entry inhibitors may find application against other enveloped viruses that have pH-independent trigger events.",

The genes are flanked by inverted terminal repeats (145 bases long). AAV produces progeny viruses in the presence of helper viruses, while in their absence it replicates with cell division.

These sequences are required for packaging into the viral coat, for stabilization of the DNA within the cell and for the generation of double-stranded DNA. When packaged, the size of the transgene may not exceed 4.5 kb. AAV vectors have been tested in a variety of model systems and in a limited number of clinical trials involving patients with cystic fibrosis and Factor IX deficiency. KB reported on AAV gene therapy involving diseases of the eye (such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy) and the use of AAV vectors in a mouse model. Frederick G. Hayden, Ph.D. (FH), University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, discussed intranasal vaccines for influenza prevention in children. The master donor strain containing the attenuating mutations for CAIV (cold-adapted influenza vaccine) was developed in 1967. The virus is liveattenuated, cold-adapted (25 \u2022 C), and temperature sensitive.",

Combining the donor virus with HA and NA gene segments from wildtype antigenic variants results in CAIV. Upon application of CAIV, nasal IgG is elicited as well as a systemic CTL influenza-specific immune response. Two doses are required. FH reported trials with children (aged 15-71 months), COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) patients, and working age and elderly adults. For seronegative children, the 50% infectious dose for children was 10 4 pfu/child and up to 10 7 pfu/strain could be tolerated. Shedding is as low as 10 3 pfu/mL for about 10 days; person-to-person transmission was rarely observed. Nasal and throat swab specimen testing yielded influenza virus unchanged from the vaccine virus, both genotypically and phenotypically. CAIV shedding in healthy adults, HIV patients or patients with COPD was maximum 50% and did not last longer than 1 week. From another study of almost 10,000 children (aged 1-17 years), adverse side effects (such as acute respiratory, asthma, systemic bacterial and acute gastroenteritis) were not significant as compared to the placebo group. While rhinorrhea was frequently observed (in 15-30%), fever was found only in a small percentage (<5%) within 10 days after vaccination. Comparable results were observed also in vaccinated adults. FH also covered the safety and efficacy aspects in immunosuppressed individuals from contacts with CAIV-T (trial) vaccinated health care workers. Low titers of recoverable virus were detected (<3.0 log 10 TCID 50 /mL) in children. The HID 50 (human infectious dose) for serosusceptibles was 2.5-4.5 log 10 TCID 50 /mL for children and 5.0-6.6 log 10 TCID 50 /mL for adults. From CAIV trials in South Africa with 3242 ambulatory older adults (60-97 years), the efficacy against culture-positive influenza was 53% against A/Panama/2007/99, (H3N2), and not effective against B/Sichuan/397/00, resulting in overall efficacies of 42%. FH reported that supplemental CAIV in COPD patients did not add significant efficacy. From a phase III trial with trivalent CAIV (H1N1, H3N2, B, two doses intranasal spray, 8 weeks apart) in 1602 children (15 months to 16 years) the protective efficacy was very high, 95% for H3N2 and 91% for B after one year. These data and other studies presented led to the conclusions that CAIV is easy to administer (nasal spray versus injection); it induces IgA, serum IgG and a specific CTL response; the efficacies are comparable to injected vaccines in adults (possibly superior to trivalent inactivated vaccines in young children), while its use is limited by the U.S. FDA's approval of CAIV for healthy adults only (aged 5-49 years), by the high maintenance costs (frozen vaccine, cold chain) and by the transmission risk. Several other formulations for inactivated intranasal vaccines, such as packaging in liposomes, proteosomes and carbohydrate biopolymers are currently under investigation.",

Humans are the only major reservoir for the measles virus, and population groups of greater than several hundred thousand are required to sustain transmission. Serologic assays with high sensitivity and specificity for measles IgM exist, and the virus can be isolated and identified in the laboratory. Vaccines exist that are highly effective in developed countries, and strategies have been developed for intervention and surveillance to demonstrate progress. Measles eradication should be achieved in Europe by 2007 and in Africa by 2010, while in America eradication was achieved in 2000. The measles elimination strategy in the US began in 1966 and aimed for high vaccine coverage at age one year, high coverage at school entry, careful surveillance and aggressive outbreak control. In 1998 there were 100 cases in the U.S.; 34 were imported, 33 were linked to imported cases, and 34 were unlinked. In Africa, measles mortality was significantly reduced in the years 2001-2003 by immunization programs that vaccinated 112 million children and averted an estimated 170,000 deaths annually. In summary, major progress has been made: measles has been essentially eliminated in the Americas, and the program is on track for a 50% reduction in mortality worldwide. The goal for worldwide eradication is by 2010; however, polio eradication is a higher priority.",
