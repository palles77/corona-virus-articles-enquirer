From the collection of clinical features, we found that all patients reported fever and dyspnea (Table 1) . Moreover, Patient 1 also had diarrhea, and Patient 3 had cough and myalgia/fatigue additionally. Laboratory findings show that C-reactive protein (CRP) were obviously increased in all patients, and decreased lymphocyte counts and increased procalcitonin were observed in Patient 2 and 3 (Table 1) . Additionally, Patient 2 also had elevated hypersensitive troponin I, creatine, and urea in serum, indicating myocardial injury and renal function damage. Patient 3 had increases in aspartate aminotransferase (ASL) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ( Table 1) , which indicate liver injury. During the hospitalization, all patients received empirical antiviral and antibiotic treatment (Table 1) . Patient 1 also experienced intravenous immunoglobulin therapy from day 11 of hospitalization (Table 1) . Notably, three patients died on day 24, 13, 12 of hospitalization, respectively.",

It was shown that a variety of immune factors was capable of altering gut microbiota homeostasis balance, such as IL-10, IL-23, NLRP6, NOD-like receptor protein 3, and IgA 13 . And the imbalance or dysbiosis in gut microbiota would contribute to an enhanced mucosal permeability and thus leading to microbial translocation and a second infection. Moreover, gut microbiota was able to modulate the immune response and played an important role in immune-mediated diseases, suggesting a vicious circle between immune disorder and gut microbiota imbalance 14 . All these findings indicated that the balance of gut microbiota can be disrupted in case of coronavirus infection due to the immune disorder. In this study, we further identified the changes in gut microbiota during the novel coronavirus infection and found that (1) the proportion of probiotics was significantly reduced, such as Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Eubacterium, and (2) the proportion of conditioned pathogenic bacteria was significantly increased, such as Corynebacterium of Actinobacteria and Ruthenibacterium of Firmicutes. In addition, we also found that the fungi in the gut microbiota of the two patients are not common fungi in healthy cohort (eg. Candida and Saccharomyces cerevisiae), some rare fungi dominate the fungal of gut microbiota, such as Aspergillus, Kluyveromyces.",

We aim to describe the dynamic characteristics of immune system in 3 critical patients with refractory hypoxemia, and discuss the relationship between hypoxemia severity and immune cell levels, and the changes of gut microbes of COVID-2019 patient. Methods This is a retrospective study from 3 patients with 2019-nCoV infection admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, a COVID-2019 designated hospital in Wuhan, from January 31 to February 6, 2020. All patients were diagnosed and classified based on the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (6th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China 4 . We recorded the epidemiological history, demographic features, clinical characteristics, symptoms and signs, treatment and clinical outcome in detail. Blood samples were collected and we determined the expression levels of immune cells (CD3 + T cells, CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, CD19 + B cells, and CD16 + 56 + NK cells) in different time points. Nanopore Targeted Sequencing was used to determine the alterations of gut microbiota homeostasis.",

Blood samples were collected from three patients at different time to determine the blood routine, coagulation function, blood biochemistry and inflammation-related markers. ECG monitors were used to record daily oximetry saturation of three patients.

The analysis results showed that no typical pathogens detected in the two patients, such as Clostridium difficile, however the structure of the gut microbiota fluctuated greatly both in bacteria and fungi (Table 2). Firstly, Patient 1's Actinobacteria was significantly higher than health cohort both in the test of two days in a row. The proportion of Actinobacteria in bacteria of patient 1 for two consecutive days are 70.7% and 44.17%, respectively. The abundance of Actinobacteria increase in patient 1 was mainly triggered by the significant increase in Corynebacterium (77.12%, 44.67%) at the level of genus. In addition, Kluyveromyces dominates the intestinal fungal flora of this patient, which the proportion of fungi for 2 day are 93.4% and 99.26%.

Consistently, in these critical patients with COVID-2019, we found that the lower immune cell levels, the more serious hypoxia, which suggested that the imbalance between host immunity and coronavirus would lead to worse clinical outcome. Furthermore, evidence have identified the adverse effects of coronavirus on host immune system10,11 .
