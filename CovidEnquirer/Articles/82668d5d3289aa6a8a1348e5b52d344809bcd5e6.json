Head-to-head comparisons of such assays using a single set of standard specimens provide additional information about key assay parameters such as sensitivity, specificity and lower limits of detection, and help to inform the decision regarding which method to use. We evaluated two real-time PCR platforms: the Fast-track Diagnostics\u00ae (FTD) multiplex respiratory panel and a TaqMan array card (TAC) for simultaneous uniplex detection of multiple respiratory pathogens. Two sets of samples were used to evaluate the assays. One set was created by spiking pooled nasal wash or phosphate buffered saline with specified volumes of known concentrations of virus and/or bacteria. Clinical nasal wash specimens from children with lower respiratory tract illness comprised the other set. Thirteen pathogen targets were compared between the two platforms. Testing with a validation panel of spiked samples revealed a sensitivity of 96.1% and 92.9% for the FTD and TAC assays, respectively. Specificity could not be reliably calculated due to a suspected contamination of the sample substrate. Inter-assay agreement was high (N 95%) for most targets. Previously untested clinical specimens tested by both assays revealed a high percent agreement (N 95%) for all except rhinovirus, enterovirus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Limitations of this evaluation included extraction of the validation samples by two different methods and the evaluation of the assays in different laboratories. However, neither of these factors significantly impacted inter-assay agreement for these sets of samples, and it was demonstrated that both assays could reliably detect clinically relevant concentrations of bacterial and viral pathogens.",

            "text": "While traditional microbiological methods continue to play an important role in determining the causes of respiratory tract infections, nucleic acid detection tests are now the diagnostic tools of choice for many respiratory pathogens. These advanced diagnostics offer several advantages over the traditional methods Murdoch et al., 2010) ; they may be adapted to include additional targets as needed, can simultaneously detect multiple organisms, have the capacity to detect organisms that would be otherwise difficult to identify due to being fastidious, less viable or present only in very small amounts, can quantify the amount of organism in the sample, and can measure pathogen load . Several commercial and in-house assays are now available that detect multiple pathogens, but there are limited published studies of head-to-head comparisons (Sakthivel et al, 2012) . Here we present an evaluation of the commercial Fast-track Diagnostics\u00ae Respiratory 21 Kit (Fast-track Diagnostics, Luxembourg), a real-time multiplex PCR assay, and a TaqMan array card (TAC, formerly Taqman Low-Density Array or TLDA) (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), a real-time multiple uniplex PCR platform produced by the National Center for Respiratory Diseases, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Kodani et al., 2011) . The evaluation came about as part of an assessment for a diagnostic platform for the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH), a large multi-center, standardized, case control study of the etiology of severe and very severe pneumonia in five African and two Asian countries (Adegbola and Levine, 2011) .",

The FTD assay can test up to 12 specimens per 8-hour run and includes internal positive and negative controls as well as an extraction control. The TAC assay evaluated was comprised of 21 uniplex PCR assays that are conducted simultaneously, in duplicate, on a single 384-well microfluidic card with eight ports. One of the ports is dedicated to a negative control and another can be dedicated to a positive control allowing for the testing of 6-7 clinical specimens per 2.5-hour run on a single card. Two internal positive control assays and four nucleic acid extraction control assays are included in the card (Kodani et al., 2011) . The FTD platform requires a nucleic acid elution volume of 60 \u03bcL divided between the six PCR pools (10 \u03bcL template nucleic acid per pool) while the TAC platform requires 20 \u03bcL per of 48 PCR reactions (20 \u03bcL template nucleic acid added to each port).",

Sample concentration was confirmed by a combination of the following: use of a turbometer followed by confirmation with colony counts, plaque assays, and TCID50 methods. Five samples of nasal wash from healthy adults were not spiked with viruses and served as negative controls (samples 46-50). Part two of the panel (samples 51-81) included viruses, bacteria, and viral/bacterial mixtures of known quantities (samples 51-54, 62, 72, 73) , dilutions (samples 55-61), or both (samples 68-71, 74-81) spiked into phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and an additional five negative controls consisting of PBS alone (samples 63-67). The panel was designed to evaluate the sensitivity of the assays within a range of pathogen concentrations commonly found in clinical specimens, and to assess potential inhibition due to matrix effects in nasal wash specimens. Panel design also took into consideration the limits of detection previously published for TAC (Kodani et al., 2011) as we well as those reported by the Fast Track manufacturer (ranging from 10 2 to 10 4 copies/mL, with an average limit of detection of 5.20 \u00d7 10 3 copies/mL).

Because rhinovirus, S. pneumoniae, and S. aureus were frequently detected at low levels in the first 50 samples, it is likely that the nasal wash pooled from healthy adults included specimens from one or more adults who were carriers of these agents. These pathogens were detected more frequently by the FTD assay than by TAC, and when these samples were removed from the analysis the agreement between the two platforms for detecting S. pneumoniae was excellent. Conversely, S. pneumoniae was detected more frequently by TAC in a set of 149 clinical specimens than it was by the FTD assay. The same was true of rhinovirus and enterovirus. The reduced sensitivity of the FTD rhinovirus species primers (particularly B and C strains), has been noted elsewhere (Sakthivel et al., 2012). Since the time of this evaluation, the rhinovirus primers in the Fast-track platform and the rhinovirus targets in the TAC platform have been updated. For all other targets, the inter-assay agreements in this evaluation were very high (N 95%), and were similar to the results of another head-to-head evaluation including the FTD platform (Anderson et al., 2013) . In this evaluation, there are at least two important limitations that may have affected the results. The first was that, due to logistical constraints, two different nucleic acid extraction procedures were used in the assessment of the validation panel. Due to differences in extraction volumes used and the recovery efficiencies of these methods, the concentration of primary specimen to eluent was quite different and may account for some of the differences in pathogens detected. However, it should be noted that a previous evaluation of the extraction methods founds their performance to be comparable (Yang et al., 2010) . The other important limitation was that the evaluations were conducted in different laboratories and frozen samples had to be shipped between testing locations.",

It was demonstrated that both platforms could reliably detect clinically relevant concentrations of bacterial and viral pathogens spiked in nasal wash or buffer as well as individual pathogens present in mixed samples. Inter-assay agreement did not vary significantly when different nucleic acid extraction methods were used in comparison to the clinical specimen evaluation where nucleic acid extraction was held constant. Most importantly, the head-to-head evaluation described here provided a direct comparison of the two platforms that were unavailable elsewhere, and confirmed that either platform would be appropriate for detecting important pathogens from respiratory specimens. Since the time of this evaluation, both platforms have been adapted to include additional pathogen targets and both have been adopted for use in multi-center field based etiology studies among infants and children. The TAC platform has some operational advantages in that individual reactions can be updated without having to optimize multiplexed panels, there is a low sample volume requirement, and minimal pipetting steps are involved. An advantage of the FTD platform is the ability to use less specialized and more widely available real-time PCR equipment.",
