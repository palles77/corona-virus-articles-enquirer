            "text": "MERS-CoV rapidly spread in South Korea within 1 month after the first diagnosis, due to family care, visits from family members, hospital shopping, lack of isolated rooms, and overcrowded emergency rooms. 4 Although South Korea had experienced H1N1 in 2009, the coping system for the prevention and control of infection did not function appropriately. 5 Because of MERS-CoV's uncertainty, inaccurate information, and late governmental confrontation, public trust weakened as the infection and mortality rates increased. 6 Not only ordinary people but also healthcare providers were afraid of MERS-CoV. In particular, nurses who interacted closely with infected patients became afraid and anxious that MERS-CoV would affect them and their families, as they saw cases of healthcare providers becoming infected. 7 Nurses who cared for patients with the new infectious disease seemed to be afraid due to lack of information. 8 In addition, they felt ethical pressure because they were obligated to provide care despite the threat to their safety. 9 During the period in 2015 when MERS-CoV was prevalent, the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs conducted a survey of nurses who were caring for MERS-CoV patients. 10 The survey indicated that 22.2% of nurses experienced post-traumatic stress disorder. A study about the long-term effect of SARS patient care reported that healthcare providers felt high levels of post-traumatic stress even after 13-26 months. 11 Therefore, it is necessary to explore how South Korean nurses perceive the experience of MERS-CoV patient care 12 months after caring for MERS-CoV patients. It is further necessary to establish a safety system for healthcare providers and, by examining nurses' experiences, prepare for other future infectious disease outbreaks.",

            "text": "In such cases, when a deep understanding of a specific phenomenon is required, qualitative research is recommended. Qualitative research clarifies participants' awareness of the phenomenon, allows comprehension, and offers insights about how awareness affects their actions. 12 Additionally, a phenomenological study is appropriate to deeply understand the essence and meaning of human experiences in a situational context that exist in individuals' consciousness. 12 Literature review of studies examining the experience of nurses who treated a new infectious disease indicated that nurses who cared for SARS and H1N1 patients lacked exact information, guidelines for patient care, and individual protection equipment. Thus, they experienced a high level of stress. 13, 14 In addition, they experienced extreme stress after infectious disease patients passed away. 15 Nurses who cared for MERS-CoV patients in Saudi Arabia also experienced fear from lack of information about MERS-CoV and psychological trauma owing to the infection of their colleagues and deaths of their patients. 13 However, there are differences in nurses' experiences across countries because nursing resources, healthcare systems, and cultural backgrounds differ. After MERS-CoV outbreaks, studies on topics such as recognition of the danger of MERS-CoV, effectiveness of personal protection equipment (PPE), and ethical problems were conducted in South Korea. 4, 5, 16, 17 One study examined post-traumatic stress and influencing factors for nurses who cared for MERS-CoV patients. 10 However, the survey was conducted immediately after the MERS-CoV outbreak and addressed only stress or negative experiences. It is necessary to identify whether nurses continue to experience negative emotions such as posttraumatic stress after a certain amount of time has passed. Particularly, a study of the overall, holistic experience including not only the negative but also the positive experiences and support factors is needed.",

Other studies also showed that nurses who cared for patients felt the most pressure when infectious diseases were prevalent and simultaneously feared infection. 7 However, they could not refuse the request from the hospital, because they were aware of the lack of professional resources and felt strong responsibility as nurses. This result is consistent with those of other studies indicating that nurses felt ethical pressure when they were compelled to provide care. 9 Nurses' responsibility as healthcare providers conflicts with the demand for safety as a human, which increased their stress. 14 Psychological stress experienced by medical teams who cared for infected patients was similar to that of nurses who cared for SARS patients 11 or medical teams who cared for MERS-CoV patients in Saudi Arabia. 13 The nurses who cared for SARS patients exhibited high levels of anxiety and psychological trauma during and after caring for patients. 15 In a study of nurses who cared for MERS-CoV patients, 10 the factors identified as causing post-traumatic stress were psychological job requirements, physical job requirements, and manager support. Thus, a system is needed to help reduce physical job requirements that takes into consideration the psychological job requirements of nurses who cared for MERS patients, to manage their post-traumatic stress and provide appropriate support. In addition, a mental health and stress control program by the government and hospital for nurses who cared for patients is needed to prevent psychological trauma.",

Other studies have reported that nurses were hurt and felt discriminated against because of the distorted view of society in which MERS-CoV was prevalent. 19 The reason nurses with children did not want to volunteer could be related to this. 20 In this situation, the only strength was support from friends and family. Participants were close to each other and even expressed support at the time owing to comradery. Family members were originally worried about the participants' safety but later became good supporters, enabling participants to focus on patient care. Studies of SARS patient care by Chung et al. 21 and Kim and Choi 22 also indicated that the poor social support of family, friends, and bosses was significantly related to burnout in nurses caring for MERS-CoV patients. To reduce burnout and stress in nurses caused by infectious patient care, the support of superiors, friends, and family is important. Related studies and national and cultural considerations based on the results of the present study are recommended.",

First, the nurses' efforts were forgotten after the end of the MERS-CoV outbreak. They participated in MERS-CoV patient care owing to their sense of responsibility and vocational ethics. However, they nevertheless experienced a significant amount of psychological and physical pain. To recruit healthcare provider volunteers when similar situations occur in the future, the government must appropriately reward them. Second, a preparatory system must be established that could work anytime to prevent diffusion of infectious disease. It is desirable that people begin to take infection control seriously owing to the MERS-CoV outbreak, but the government's and hospitals' continuous support and investment are needed to retain the public's interest. Healthcare providers in South Korea must establish a preparatory system to respond instantaneously to outbreaks. Third, nurses noted that a change in the mindset of the patients and their guardians is needed along with improvement of the healthcare system. As comprehensive nursing services were begun recently in South Korea after the MERS-CoV outbreak, hospital visiting was limited. However, patients' and their guardians' knowledge of this system was inadequate, and it was reported that this system could be a factor that prompted the nurses' desire to change the department they were working in or to quit their job. 24 A strategy for retaining resources and a systematic preparatory system that could protect the healthcare providers and ensure the readiness of the infection care system thoroughly in case of an unpredictable disaster is required.",

Im et al. 25 interviewed 8 intensive care unit nurses who cared for MERS-CoV patients in Korea and identified 3 relevant factors: \"feeling hopeless and cut off,\" \"feeling shame and overworked,\" and \"feeling the pride of fulfilling a duty.\" In addition, when compared to the experiences of nurses who cared for SARS, H1N1, and ebola patients, the experiences of patient care for emerging infectious diseases were similar in terms of nurses' physical and emotional exhaustion, frustration, and fulfillment. 7, 8, 26 What distinguishes the results of this study from those of other studies is that nurses emphasized urgent improvement in the healthcare system. Social crises caused by new types of infectious diseases can always occur again. However, healthcare providers' experiences might not differ greatly for new types of infections. Therefore, it is important to establish an action plan based on the healthcare providers' valuable experiences. It should be focused on the problems that we identified based on nurses' experiences, and coping strategies and the healthcare system must be urgently improved.",
