We identified several ''enabling pairs'' of neutralizing and nonneutralizing anti-ebolavirus monoclonal antibodies, whose combination exhibited new functional profiles, including transforming a non-neutralizing antibody to a neutralizer. Sub-neutralizing concentrations of antibodies 2G4 or m8C4 enabled non-neutralizing antibody FVM09 (IC 50 >1 mM) to exhibit potent neutralization (IC 50 1-10 nM). While FVM09 or m8C4 alone failed to protect Ebola-virus-infected mice, a combination of the two antibodies provided 100% protection. Furthermore, non-neutralizers FVM09 and FVM02 exponentially enhanced the potency of two neutralizing antibodies against both Ebola and Sudan viruses. We identified a hotspot for the binding of these enabling antibody pairs near the interface of the glycan cap and GP2. Enabling cooperativity may be an underappreciated phenomenon for viruses, with implications for the design and development of immunotherapeutics and vaccines.",

The combination of antibody therapy with adenovirus-expressed interferon (IFN)-a in nonhuman primates (NHPs) also resulted in enhanced efficacy (Qiu et al., 2013) . While these studies focused on EBOV-specific therapies, we recently targeted other ebolaviruses and demonstrated improved neutralization efficacy by combining several pan-ebolavirus therapeutic mAbs (Holtsberg et al., 2015; Howell et al., 2016; Keck et al., 2015) .

The crystal structure of EBOV GP in complex with the neutralizing mAb KZ52 showed that three GP1 subunits assemble in a chalice-like structure surrounded by three GP2 subunits, which, with an N-terminal portion of GP1, form the base of the chalice (Lee et al., 2008) and anchor GP to the virus membrane. The endosomal receptor binding site (RBS) is positioned at the apex of the GP1 core and is largely concealed by a glycan cap at the rim of the chalice and by the highly glycosylated and disordered mucin-like domain (MLD). The best-characterized neutralizing epitope within EBOV GP is the so-called ''base epitope'' consisting of residues within GP1 and GP2 and recognized by mAbs KZ52 (Davidson et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2008) and by the ZMapp therapeutic mAb cocktail components 2G4 and 4G7 (Davidson et al., 2015; Murin et al., 2014; Pallesen et al., 2016; Tran et al., 2016) .

In all examples, synergy was observed between two or more antibodies that could each neutralize the virus independently. Here, we describe a novel phenomenon of cooperative neutralization by mAb pairs consisting of a neutralizing mAb and a non-neutralizing mAb. We identified several such pairs by screening a panel of mAbs for binding to ebolavirus glycoproteins and for their ability to neutralize one or more ebolaviruses. We observed neutralization by weakly or moderately neutralizing mAbs that was enhanced when they were paired with specific non-neutralizing mAbs targeting epitopes within the glycan cap of ebolavirus GP. We also found that an otherwise non-neutralizing pan-ebolavirus mAb acquired neutralizing activity in the presence of sub-neutralizing concentrations of a mAb that bound to an adjacent epitope. Finally, we demonstrated that cooperative activity extended to protection in vivo, as a pair of mAbs that were individually non-protective, provided full protection against EBOV infection when combined in a cocktail.",

The test mAbs (biotinylated or having a mouse Fc region) were then added at their EC 50 concentrations, and relative binding was determined. We noted competition between mAbs with closely located epitopes (Table S1), for example, mAbs 13C6 and FVM04, as we have described (Keck et al., 2015) , and among the GP basebinding mAbs 2G4, 4G7, and KZ52, consistent with previous reports (Murin et al., 2014) . Interestingly, this study revealed that pre-incubation with the macaque-derived mAb FVM09 enhanced the binding of m8C4 and m2G4, by 99% and 41%, respectively, but decreased binding of KZ52. In addition, FVM20, whose epitope overlaps with that of FVM09 (Keck et al., 2015) , also enhanced m8C4 and m2G4 binding, by 71% and 29%.

Binding of 13C6 to SUDV was enhanced by FVM09 and FVM20 (by 55% and 29%, respectively; Table S2 ). We then tested the binding enhancement over a full range of mAb concentrations. The binding of m8C4 to EBOV GP was strongly increased in the presence of a saturating concentration of FVM09, as was the binding of FVM09 in the presence of a saturating concentration of m8C4 (4-and 2.5-fold reduction of EC 50 , respectively) ( Figures 1A and 1B) . A similar, but lesser, increase in binding was observed for m2G4 with EBOV GP in the presence of FVM09 (2-fold reduction of EC 50 ; Figure 1C ), but not for binding of 4G7 ( Figure 1D ). The binding of m8C4 to SUDV GP was enhanced >2-fold in presence of FVM09 ( Figure 1E ), and an enhancement of the weak binding of m13C6 to SUDV GP was observed ( Figure 1F ). FVM09 also slightly enhanced the binding of m8C4 to BDBV GP ( Figure 1G ) but not RESTV GP ( Figure 1H ). Our results thus demonstrate multiple combinations of mAbs that enhance binding to EBOV, SUDV, and/or BDBV.",

A similar matrix array enhancement experiment was performed for EBOV neutralization, using pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (VSV-EBOV GP-Luc) infection of Vero cells. MAbs m8C4, FVM04, KZ52, m2G4, or m4G7 were applied at their respective EC 50 concentrations, and their ability to neutralize was determined in the absence or presence of individual non-neutralizing antibodies at saturating concentrations. Consistent with the mAb binding studies, m8C4-mediated neutralization was potentiated by more than 90% in the presence of FVM09 or FVM20 and was moderately increased by FVM02 but was not increased by m4B8, m17C6, m16G8, or c13C6 ( Figure 2 ). For GP base-binding mAbs m2G4 and m4G7, a more moderate enhancement of 23%-26% was also observed in the presence of FVM09 or FVM20, while the other mAbs tested did not have any impact on neutralization. In contrast, for another base-binding mAb, KZ52, neutralization in the presence of any tested mAb remained within \u00b110% of the value seen with KZ52 alone. FVM04-mediated neutralization was slightly potentiated in the presence of FVM09, FVM02, and FVM20 (13%, 15%, and 17%, respectively) but was significantly reduced in the presence of c13C6, consistent with the overlapping binding footprints of these two mAbs on EBOV GP (Howell et al., 2016; Keck et al., 2015) .",

            "text": "The extent of the mAb synergy described above was quantified with CompuSyn software, which uses a mathematical approach developed by Chou and Talalay to quantify synergy (Chou, 2010; Chou and Talalay, 1984) . This methodology defines two parameters-the combination index (CI) and the dose reduction index (DRI)-to describe the effect of drug combination. The CI provides a quantitative measure for additive effects (CI = 1), synergism (CI < 1), and antagonism (CI > 1). The DRI provides a measure of the potential fold dose reduction that can be achieved by drug combinations. CI and DRI values were calculated for EBOV neutralization over the full range of mAb concentrations ( Figure S1 ) along with the values for 50% and 90% neutralization (fraction affected [Fa] 50 and Fa 90) ( Figure 3I ). This analysis revealed an extremely high degree of synergy between mAb pairs m8C4/FVM09, FVM09/m8C4, and FVM09/ 2G4, where the first mAb in each pair was tested at various concentrations, while the second was kept at a constant concentration (Figures S1A-S1C). The concentration-dependent CI values for m8C4/FVM09, FVM09/m8C4, and FVM09/2G4 ranged from 0.007 to 0.12, 0.012 to 1.7, and 0.13 to 1.1, and the DRI values ranged from 8 to 145, 0.5 to 84, and 0.6 to 10, respectively (Figures S1A-S1C). For SUDV neutralization, the degree of synergy between m8C4 and FVM09 was marginal (CI close to 1; Figure S1D), while clear synergy was evident when 16F6 and FVM09 were combined (CI as low as 0.1; Figures S1E and S1F). For the m8C4/FVM09 pair, analysis confirmed a synergistic neutralization of live EBOV (CI values as low as 0.0001 and DRI values as high as 56; Figure S1G ) but only marginal neutralization enhancement of live SUDV (CI values mostly around 1 and DRI values between 1 and 3; Figure S1H ). We also tested for synergy between FVM04 with FVM09 or FVM02 and found that the combination of FVM04/FVM09 exhibited marginal synergy (CI, 0.47-0.6; DRI, 1.5-2) and only at higher concentrations ( Figures  S2A-S2C ). However, FVM02/FVM04 did result in synergy, which (B) FVM09 is titrated into a fixed sub-neutralizing concentration of m8C4 (13 mg/mL) (red), which shows enhanced potency compared to FVM09 alone (blue) or m8C4 at 13 mg/mL (dotted line). (C) FVM09 titrated into 0.2 mg/mL of c2G4 shows a clear neutralizing dose response (red) in contrast to FVM09 alone (blue). The dotted line shows percentage neutralization by 0.2 mg/mL c2G4 alone. (D) The neutralization of VSV-SUDV-GP-Luc by m8C4 and FVM09. m8C4 alone (green) and FVM09 (blue) both show dose-dependent neutralization of virus, while the combination (red) appears to be merely additive. (E) Neutralization by 16F6 alone (orange) or in the presence of 1 mg/mL FVM09 (blue) or 10 mg/mL FVM09 (red) is potentiated compared to 16F6 alone or FVM09 at 10 mg/mL (dotted line). (F) Potentiation is also seen when 16F6 is titrated into 10 mg/mL FVM02 (red) compared to 16F6 neutralization alone (orange). (G and H) PRNT assays were performed using live EBOV (G) and SUDV (H) treated with various concentrations of FVM09 (blue), m8C4 (green), or m8C4 in the presence of 15 mg/mL of FVM09 (red). FVM04 was used as a control pan-ebolavirus antibody. (I) CI values are shown for the indicated combinations for 50% and 90% neutralization (Fa, fraction affected). Antibodies used at constant and variable concentrations and the virus used for the respective neutralization assay are shown on the x axis. In (A)-(H), each data point represents the average of three measurements \u00b1 SD. See also Figures S1-S3.",

FVM09 Fab, as for full-length FVM09 ( Figure 3B ), displayed no neutralization of VSV-EBOV GP-Luc by itself but exhibited dose-dependent neutralization in the presence of m8C4 at a constant concentration ( Figure S3B ).

Consistent with this low binding, the m8C4 Fab induced marginal neutralization, at only 20 mg/mL, and this neutralization was moderately enhanced by FVM09 ( Figure S3D ). For SUDV, the m8C4 Fab by itself showed moderate neutralization of VSV-SUDV GP-Luc, but this was strongly enhanced in the presence of FVM09. Taken together, these data indicate that bivalent binding and the Fc portion do not play a critical role in the observed cooperative neutralization. Nevertheless, bivalent configuration of full-length mAb is likely important for binding to the EBOV epitope with sufficient avidity to support maximal cooperative neutralization.",

Alanine substitutions at these residues reduced m8C4 binding to 2.5%, 12.9%, and 25.3% of wild-type, respectively, suggesting that these residues constitute key contact sites for m8C4 ( Figure 4B ). In contrast, FVM04 and FVM09 showed no reduction in binding to these mutants relative to wild-type GP; in fact, FVM09 exhibited higher binding to R136A than to wild-type GP. Similar analysis with FVM09 showed that the W288A, F290A, or W291A mutations within the b17-b18 loop essentially eliminated FVM09 binding to GP (to 0%, 6.2%, and 0% of wild-type reactivity, respectively; Figures 4C and 4D) . Interestingly, the F290A and W291A loop mutations, while eliminating FVM09 binding, increased m8C4 binding by 3-to 4-fold ( Figure 4F ), suggesting an interaction between the two epitopes. In addition, we observed that an alanine substitution of E292, which is adjacent to the FVM09 epitope residues, increased binding of both FVM09 and m8C4 ( Figure 4F ). The key residues of the m8C4 epitope, Q251 and F252 within the glycan cap and R136 within the GP1 core, lie in close proximity on the outer side of GP1 and adjacent to the partially disordered b17-b18 loop (residues 279-302) (Lee et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2016) , which contains the FVM09 epitope (described below; Figure 4E ).

Based on the binding data, we hypothesized that mutational impairment of FVM09 binding would mimic the enhancing effect of FVM09 binding on m8C4 neutralizing activity. To test this hypothesis, we generated a mutant GP with three mutations: W288A/F290A/W291A (EBOV-GP-AAA). While EBOV-GP-AAA failed to bind to FVM09, it exhibited moderately enhanced binding to m8C4 (2-to 3-fold higher than wild-type [WT] GP; Figure 5A ). Despite this moderate effect of the triple mutation on m8C4 binding, a pseudotyped VSV virus incorporating the triple mutations (VSV-EBOV GP-AAA-Luc) was neutralized by m8C4 over 600-fold more effectively than wildtype VSV-EBOV GP-Luc ( Figure 5B ). In contrast, the triple mutation caused only a modest reduction of KZ52-mediated neutralization compared to wild-type VSV-EBOV GP-Luc ( Figure 5C ), indicating that the enhanced neutralization is specific to m8C4.",

We specifically identified two adjacent epitopes within the EBOV GP glycan cap that, when bound, facilitate cooperative neutralization. Furthermore, we observed a similar phenomenon for another set of mAbs for neutralizing SUDV. These data demonstrate that cooperative neutralization exists for several ebolavirus-specific antibody pairs and identify a previously unknown mechanism for antibody targeting of viruses, since the potentiating effect of non-neutralizing antibodies are rarely, if ever, evaluated in concert with neutralizing antibodies. Synergistic neutralization has been described for several mAbs targeting HIV (Laal et al., 1994; Li et al., 1998; Mascola et al., 1997; Vijh-Warrier et al., 1996; Xu et al., 2001) . This includes triple and quadruple combinations of mAbs against gp120 and gp41 (Li et al., 1998) . These mAbs were each neutralizing when used singly, and their combination led to CI values as low as 0.2 and DRI values as high as 24 for triple mAb cocktails (Li et al., 1998) . Other synergistic combinations of HIV antibodies reached a CI of 0.2 and DRI of 490 in the most potent combinations (Vijh-Warrier et al., 1996) . While the data presented here are reminiscent of these reported synergies among HIV antibodies, a unique aspect of our finding is the identification of non-neutralizing antibodies that convert poorly neutralizing antibodies into potent neutralizers. While FVM09 by itself has almost no EBOV neutralizing activity, its combination with the poorly neutralizing mAb m8C4 showed a 70-fold reduction in neutralization IC 50 , and the FVM09/m8C4 cocktail exhibited a CI as low as 0.01 and a DRI as high as 145. In the presence of sub-optimal concentrations of m8C4 or the GP base binder 2G4, FVM09 behaved as a neutralizing mAb with a saturable dose-response curve. Similarly, we showed that FVM09, which poorly neutralizes SUDV, and the non-neutralizing GP2 mAb FVM02, strongly potentiate the neutralizing activity of the SUDV-specific mAb 16F6. Because of the dramatic effect of mAb combinations (extremely high DRI and low CI) and the fact that the combination results are qualitatively different from those obtained with individual mAbs (transforming non-neutralizers to neutralizers), we refer to this phenomenon as ''enabling, cooperative neutralization'' (i.e., effective neutralization is dependent on both mAbs while one mAb can be a non-neutralizer).",

FVM09 and FVM20 may cause a conformational change that leads to better access of m8C4 and 2G4 to their respective epitopes. Extensive interactions of the GP1 b17-b18 loop with the GP1 core and a region of GP2 close to the base epitope suggests that FVM09-like loop-binding antibodies may ''peel'' the b17-b18 loop off from the main GP body, allowing more effective neutralization by GP base mAbs such as 2G4. Consistent with this hypothesis, our EM data suggest that this loop, when bound by FVM09, is flexible and appears to the side and above the GP trimer. This notion is also consistent with the observed competition between FVM09 and KZ52, since KZ52 appears to make contacts with the b17-b18 loop, and displacement of this loop would be expected to reduce KZ52 binding. In contrast, 2G4, which showed cooperativity with FVM09, binds to the GP base epitope at a sharper angle than KZ52 (Murin et al., 2014) , which suggests that 2G4 may not contact the b17-b18 loop.",

It is striking that the highest degree of cooperativity was observed between mAbs with adjacent epitopes.
