            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is an emerging zoonotic viral respiratory disease that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. In 2015, the largest MERS outbreak outside of the Middle East region occurred in the Republic of Korea. The rapid nosocomial transmission of MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Korean health care settings highlighted the importance and urgent need for a rapid and reliable on-site diagnostic assay to implement effective control and preventive measures. Here, the evaluation and validation of two newly developed reverse transcriptioneinsulated isothermal PCR (RT-iiPCR) methods targeting the ORF1a and upE genes of MERS-CoV are described. Compared with World Health Organizationrecommended singleplex real-time quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) assays, both RT-iiPCR assays had comparable analytical sensitivity for the detection of MERS-CoV RNA in tissue culture fluid and in sputum samples spiked with infectious virus. Furthermore, clinical evaluation was performed with sputum samples collected from subjects with acute and chronic respiratory illnesses, including patients infected with MERS-CoV. The overall agreement values between the two RT-iiPCR assays and the reference RT-qPCR assays were 98.06% (95% CI, 94.43%e100%; k Z 0.96) and 99.03% (95% CI, 95.88%e100%; k Z 0.99) for ORF1a and upE assays, respectively. The ORF1a and upE MERS-CoV RT-iiPCR assays coupled with a fielddeployable system provide a platform for a highly sensitive and specific on-site tool for diagnosis of MERS-CoV infections.

Recent phylogenetic analysis of viral isolates from humans, camels, and bats revealed that bats may have been the original primary reservoir of the virus, and they may have initially transmitted the virus to camels. 2 Thus, transmission of MERS-CoV to humans is suspected to occur by direct or indirect contact with infected camels or camel-related products (eg, raw camel milk, camel urine). 3, 4 Human-tohuman transmission of MERS-CoV requires close contact and can occur among relatives in households and among patients and health care workers in health care settings (nosocomial infection). 5 Since its emergence, most of the MERS-CoV infections have occurred in the Arabian Peninsula (Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia), but additional cases have been reported from countries in North Africa, Europe, North America, and Asia due to movement of infected individuals. The outbreak in the Republic of Korea in May 2015 was the largest MERS-CoV outbreak ever recorded outside of Saudi Arabia and resulted in 185 laboratory-confirmed human infections in Korea and one in China, with 36 deaths. 6 The index case was traced back to an individual with a travel history to the Middle East. The MERS outbreaks have been attributed to failures of preventive and control measures in health care settings. 5 Therefore, early diagnosis, prompt isolation of suspected cases, and timely tracing of case contacts are key strategies to prevent further transmission.",

The two RT-qPCR assays developed by Corman et al 7, 8 shortly after the first report of the disease were designated as recommended MERS-CoV molecular diagnostics by WHO. Both assays proved to be highly sensitive and were successfully used for the diagnosis of the majority of the MERS-CoV cases. These assays target genomic regions upstream of the envelope gene (upE) and the viral open reading frame 1a (ORF1a). The RealStar MERS-CoV RT-qPCR Kit (Alotona Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany) has been developed using these WHO-recommended assays. 11 However, these assays are costly, demand expensive instrumentation, and require a dedicated laboratory environment with technically skilled personnel. Consequently, simple and rapid methods are required to meet the needs of point-of-need MERS-CoV detection. For this purpose, many isothermal RNA amplification methods were developed for exponential amplification of RNA at low and constant temperatures such as rapid one-step RNA amplification/detection assay 12 and reverse transcriptional loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). 13, 14 The RT-LAMP assay can be performed in a simple heating block.",

            "text": "Recently, fluorescent probe hydrolysisebased insulated isothermal PCR (iiPCR) for amplification and detection of nucleic acid has been described. 15 The iiPCR is highly sensitive and specific for the detection of both DNA and RNA and can be performed with a single heating source; thus, it does not require an expensive thermocycler. 16, 17 The PCR mix in a capillary tube (R-tube; GeneReach USA, Lexington, MA) is heated at the bottom. Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard convection drives fluid cycling through temperature gradients and the three PCR steps, namely denaturation, annealing, and extension, can be completed sequentially at different zones within the capillary tube. Subsequent integration of hydrolysis probe technology and an optical detection module into the device allow automatic detection and interpretation of iiPCR results. 17 Performance of iiPCR assays on a commercially available, field-deployable, and user-friendly iiPCR system, the POCKIT Nucleic Acid Analyzer (GeneReach USA), has been demonstrated to be comparable to that of realtime PCR, nested PCR, and/or virus isolation for the detection of various pathogens in different hosts, including dengue virus and malaria in human samples. 18e31 Taking advantage of this system, in this study, two singleplex RT-iiPCR assays for the detection of MERS-CoV upE and ORF1a genes separately were developed and the ability of the assays for viral nucleic acid detection was determined. The analytical sensitivity, analytical specificity, and reproducibility of the two MERS-CoV-specific RT-iiPCR assays were assessed using viral tissue culture fluid (TCF) and human sputum samples spiked with known amounts of MERS-CoV. The clinical performance of these two assays was further evaluated and validated using RNA extracted from sputum samples of MERS-CoVeinfected patients obtained from the recent Korean outbreak and compared with the corresponding reference singleplex real-time RT-qPCR assays recommended by WHO.

The ORF1a RT-iiPCR assay was able to detect MERS-CoV RNA in 54 of 55 positively confirmed samples, whereas the reference ORF1a RT-qPCR assay positively detected 52 of 55. Meanwhile, the upE RT-iiPCR assay positively detected all 55 samples, whereas the reference upE RT-qPCR assay confirmed 54 of 55 positive samples (Table 4 ). Specifically, the previously positive specimen from patient ID P085 (collected 06-14-2015) was tested as negative with ORF1a RT-iiPCR and reference singleplex ORF1a and upE RT-qPCR assays. The upE RT-iiPCR was the only assay that identified the P085 specimen as positive. Two positive samples from patients ID P130 (collected 06- and ID P148 (collected 06-21-2015) were tested as false negatives by the reference ORF1a RT-qPCR, resulting in detection of 52 of 55 positive samples (Table 4) . Thus, by comparing the RT-iiPCR results to those from the initial laboratory testing at the time of the outbreak, the sensitivities of the singleplex MERS-CoV ORF1a and upE RT-iiPCR assays were 99.03% (54 of 55; 95% CI, 95.88%e 100%) and 100% (55 of 55; 95% CI, 97.43%e100%), respectively, whereas those of the reference RT-qPCR were 97.09% (52 of 55; 95% CI, 87.43%e100%) for ORF1a and 99.03% (54 of 55; 95% CI, 95.88%e100%) for upE, respectively (Table 4 ). All samples from patients suffering from other respiratory illnesses were tested as negative with the corresponding assays indicating high specificity (100%). Lastly, the overall agreement values between the RT-iiPCR and reference RT-qPCR were 98.06% (95% CI, 94.43%e100%; k Z 0.96) for ORF1a signature, with two positive samples giving discrepant results; and 99.03% (95% CI, 95.88%e 100%; k Z 0.99) for upE signature, with one discrepant result from a positive sample between the RT-iiPCR and reference RT-qPCR (Table 5 ).",

The automated interpretation by the iiPCR machine makes the method easier because it does not require data analysis by the user. Furthermore, the ready-to-use lyophilized amplification reagents that are stable for at least 2 years at 4 C provide great ease of storage and transportation. Removal of contaminating PCR inhibitors and genomic DNA during nucleic acid extraction is critical to avoid false negative and positive results, respectively. 40 Thus, optimal RNA extraction and template preparation is key for obtaining the highest sensitivity and specificity of any molecular diagnostic assay including RT-iiPCR. Automatic or semiautomatic nucleic acid extraction methods only require basic laboratory training skills and minimize the hands-on time required for template preparation before assembling the reaction. Furthermore, the clinical samples are directly added to the lysis buffer, which immediately inactivates the pathogen and, thus, reduces the risk of exposure of the personnel handling the clinical material. However, it is important to use appropriate personal protective wear and follow recommended biosecurity guidelines during handling and testing of the clinical specimens. Utilization of a lightweight, field-deployable automatic nucleic acid extraction device (taco mini Nucleic Acid Automatic Extraction System; GeneReach USA) along with the iiPCR/POCKIT system greatly reduces the hands-on time from sample collection to results (Figure 1 ). These instruments also can be connected to a car battery and are designed as a portable system to be used in clinics, hospitals, farms, and public health laboratories in remote areas without electricity. Taking advantage of this platform, the two MERS-CoV singleplex RT-iiPCR methods targeting either the ORF1a or upE gene were established to aid rapid on-site diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection. Multiple RT-qPCR assays targeting different sequences in the MERS-CoV genome have been recommended to be used as sequential primary and confirmatory tests to help reduce the risks of misidentifying MERS-CoV cases. 34 Particularly, the upE assay has been recommended for screening purposes, whereas the ORF1a assay for confirmation. 8 Both ORF1a-and upE-specific RT-iiPCR assays described in this study were shown to be analytically sensitive, and no cross-reactivity was observed compact automatic nucleic acid (NA) extraction device (taco mini) and a portable PCR device (POCKIT). After sample collection, nucleic acids were extracted using a preloaded extraction plate in approximately 30 minutes, and subsequently, the lyophilized reverse transcription-insulated isothermal PCR reaction was reconstituted and nucleic acids were added. The mixture was transferred to an R-tube and tested in a POCKIT device. TaqMan probe hydrolysisebased amplification signals were automatically detected, processed, and interpreted, providing qualitative results on the display screen in 60 minutes.

The data showed that the singleplex ORF1a and upE RT-iiPCR and the corresponding singleplex reference RT-qPCR assays were able to detect as low as <10 copies/mL of synthetic RNA and 3.7 \u00c2 10 \u00c01 PFU/mL of infectious TCF. Similar results were obtained when analytical sensitivities of ORF1a and upE RT-iiPCR assays were evaluated using sputum samples spiked with a MERS-CoV isolate. Furthermore, the clinical sensitivity and specificity of both singleplex MERS-CoV RT-iiPCR assays were evaluated using archived sputum samples collected from confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection during the Korean outbreak in 2015. To estimate the diagnostic performance, the singleplex RT-iiPCR assay results were compared side by side with the reference singleplex RT-qPCR assay. The data indicated that the sensitivities of the singleplex MERS-CoV ORF1a and upE RT-iiPCR assays were 99.03% (54 of 55; 95% CI, 95.88%e100%) and 100% (55 of 55; 95% CI, 97.43%e100%), respectively, whereas those of the reference RT-qPCR assays were 97.09% (52 of 55; 95% CI, 87.43%e100%) for ORF1a and 99.03% (54 of 55; 95% CI, 95.88%e100%) for upE. Possible explanation for the discrepancy with initial diagnosis seen in two specimens (P085 [06- and P130 [06- ) could be viral RNA degradation during long-term storage. The viral RNA copy number of false-negative samples was below detection limit in both assays (assessed by reference RT-qPCR <10 copies), whereas the C T value of internal amplification control remained moderately low (RNase P C T 27.3 and 30.2, respectively), indicating the possibility of viral RNA loss during storage and/or the extraction process. Moreover, in a number of specimens tested, the overall estimated viral load detected during our study was lower compared with the viral copy number estimated a year earlier (data not shown). These observations suggest that the sensitivity of the assay can be adversely affected by the collection method and storage of clinical specimens. In the case of the specimen from patient ID P148 (collected 06-21-2015) that was tested as false negative by the reference ORF1a RT-qPCR assay, it could potentially be due to the presence of extremely low concentrations of target RNA. The RNA levels of the internal amplification control in this sample (RNase P C T 38.5) were the lowest compared with the rest of the samples, suggesting relatively low RNA extraction levels. Nevertheless, the data presented in this study demonstrate that the performance of both singleplex ORF1a and upE MERS-CoV RT-iiPCR tests is equivalent or higher compared with the reference singleplex RT-qPCR tests and provides much faster results (within an hour).",
