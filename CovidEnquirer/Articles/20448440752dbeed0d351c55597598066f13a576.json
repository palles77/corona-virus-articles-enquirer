For example, bronchial hyperresponsiveness may be seen in patients with allergic rhinitis. This could represent coexistent but unrecognized asthma, but also suggests that IgE-dependent inflammation may occur in the lower airway that can increase bronchial hyperresponsiveness without at the same time precipitating obvious obstruction. Clearly, allergic rhinitis is a risk factor for asthma. A second example of the interaction of upper airway inflammation and bronchial hyperreactivity are reports that viral upper respiratory tract infections may cause otherwise healthy persons to respond abnormally to inhaled histamine or irritants for several months after the infections. These same viruses usually precipitate attacks in patients with asthma, who already have hyperresponsive airways. Both of these examples suggest that inflammatory processes occurring totally or primarily in the upper airway may participate in the pathogenesis of lower respiratory tract hyperresponsiveness and asthma. (.I ALLERGY CLIN IMMLJNOL 1988; 81:1036-41.) Bronchial hyperreactivity is defined as an abnormal responsiveness of the airways, expressed as increased air flow obstruction on exposure to a variety of physical, chemical, and pharmacologic bronchoprovocational agents.' It is equally well expressed by the prompt reversal of obstruction by beta adrenergic agonists or other bronchodilators. Hyperresponsiveness is almost always present in asthma and is sometimes considered pathognomonic; it may also be seen in cystic fibrosis, chronic bronchitis, and other lung diseases.",

            "text": "Bronchial hyperreactivity is usually thought of as an abnormality of the lower respiratory tract. Recently it has been described in two disorders in which the lower respiratory tract is usually normal. Patients with allergic rhinitis, who are at risk for asthma subsequently, frequently exhibit increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness; and acute viral upper respiratory tract infections may induce bronchial responsiveness. This de novo induction of hyperresponsiveness during airway infection suggests a mechanism that may explain the frequent associations of upper respiratory tract infections with wheezing episodes in patients with asthma and also why some healthy persons can develop persisting bronchial hyperresponsiveness. The mechanism underlying hyperresponsive airways is not known, but it has been suggested that abnormalities may exist in mucosal permeability, in autonomic control of bronchial smooth muscle, or in the smooth muscle itself.' Most hypotheses presume an abnormality in the lower respiratory tract, and so offer explanation for abnormal responses seen in diseases apparently limited to the upper respiratory tract. The access of molecules from the lumen of the respiratory tract to submucosal structures is limited in the normal state by the maintenance of \"tight junctions\" between epithelial cells. These junctions may be disrupted after exposure to pollutants2 or to IgEmediated inflammation.3 However, abnormal bronchoconstriction also occurs when histamine is given parenterally to patients with asthma,4 so this cannot be the sole mechanism. The caliber of the lower airways is under balanced autonomic control. Vagal efferent nerves decrease airway caliber, and the afferent input to these reflexes may originate in irritant receptors in either the lower or upper tract mucosa.5 A major balancing factor is sympathetic tone, and decreased beta adrenergic responsiveness has been shown in asthma,h chronic bronchitis,' and viral upper respiratory tract infections8 Abnormalities of the bronchial smooth muscle, either hypertrophy or increased mass or abnormal response characteristics, have been proposed as mechanisms for hyperractivity.'",

As a first approach to understanding this association, it is worth considering the link between allergy and abnormal airway reactivity. Based on reports of a clustering of abnormal methacholine responsiveness among atopic families, some investigators have suggested a possible genetic basis for this link.22 Another possibility is that hyperresponsiveness arises in atopic persons as an acquired abnormality, perhaps as a consequence of inflammatory changes in the lower respiratory tract. Cockcroft et a1.23 have shown controlled intrapulmonary deposition of allergen in the laboratory. Environmental allergen exposurez4 can produce a transient increase in histamine and methacholine responsiveness in allergic patients who develop late-phase asthmatic reactions. These changes are of the same order of magnitude as found in normal persons after viral respiratory tract infections or after exposure to pollutants.25-28 Although the cause of the increase in reactivity is unknown, a possible mechanism is suggested by the demonstration that mucosal permeability may substantially increase after antigen challenge in sensitized monkeys.3 A final piece of evidence linking allergic inflammation is the demonstration that when patients with asthma who are allergic to house dust mites are isolated from their antigen, bronchial reactivity decreases significantly over several months .29",

            "text": "The increase in bronchial hyperresponsiveness in allergic rhinitis related to allergen-induced inflammatory changes or alterations in mucosal permeability of the lower airways may be related to natural environmental exposure to aeroallergens, resulting in IgEmediated reactions, not only in the upper respiratory tract but in the lower respiratory tract, and to effects on the lower airways that are subclinical or not sufficient to cause perceived symptoms. The evidence for this is circumstantial, but nonetheless compelling. When patients with hay fever and asthma are compared, there are insignificant differences in allergen sensitivity in terms of skin sensitivity or leukocyte histamine release.2' A number of investigators have shown that patients with allergic rhinitis who have never had asthmatic symptoms demonstrate physiologic alterations typical of acute asthma after inhalation of an appropriate allergen in the laboratory.20-22 Patients with asthma remain slightly more hyperresponsive than do those with hay fever, especially when the FEV, response is measured.20-22 Nevertheless, the differences are small and there is considerable overlap between groups. Why these patients respond to inhaled allergen in the laboratory but not after natural environmental exposure is not entirely clear, but the most likely explanation is that the amount of allergen encountered under natural conditions is far less than that used in laboratory experiments, and that the abil-ity to sustain a clinical response under conditions of lower levels of allergen exposure depends on preexisting abnormal airway reactivity.**. 29 Hence patients with marked increases in airway responsiveness, those with asthma, for example, may sustain a substantial airway response after a mild allergic reaction, and patients with modest increases in responsiveness, such as those with allergic rhinitis, experience little if any clinical effect. Despite the absence of a clinically perceptible airway response in these patients, it seems plausible that allergic stimulation is capable of causing inflammatory changes as well as subclinical airflow obstructions. Although there is no direct evidence to support this, there are reports of subtle abnormalities of lower airway function in patients with hay fever during intervals of environmental allergen exposure and symptomatic rhinitis .30",
