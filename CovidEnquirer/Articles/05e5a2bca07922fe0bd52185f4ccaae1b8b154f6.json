Whole genome phylogeny showed that this MERS-CoV strain did not cluster with the other MERS-CoV strains from Dubai that we reported recently. Instead, it formed a unique branch more closely related to other MERS-CoV strains from patients in Qatar and Hafr-Al-Batin in Saudi Arabia, as well as the MERS-CoV strains from patients in the recent Korean outbreak, in which the index patient acquired the infection during travel in the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula. Non-synonymous mutations, resulting in 11 unique amino acid differences, were observed between the MERS-CoV genome from the present study and all the other available MERS-CoV genomes. Among these 11 unique amino acid differences, four were found in ORF1ab, three were found in the S1 domain of the spike protein, and one each was found in the proteins encoded by ORF4b, ORF5, envelope gene, and ORF8. MERS-CoV detection for all other 254 dromedaries in this closed dairy herd was negative by nucleocapsid protein-capture ELISA and RNA detection. MERS-CoV IgG sero-positivity gradually increased in dromedary calves with increasing age, with positivity rates of 75% at zero to three months, 79% at four months, 89% at five to six months, and 90% at seven to twelve months. The development of a rapid antigen detection kit for instantaneous diagnosis is warranted.",

            "text": "Since its first appearance in 2012, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has affected more than 25 countries in four continents, with more than 1300 cases and a frightening fatality rate of greater than 30%. 1 A novel lineage C betacoronavirus the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has been confirmed to be the etiological agent. 2,3 The subsequent detection of MERS-CoV and its antibodies in dromedaries in various countries in the Middle East has led to the hypothesis that these animals may be the reservoir for MERS-CoV. 4-13 Furthermore, the discovery of other closely related lineage C betacoronaviruses both before and after the beginning of the MERS epidemic in various bat species and hedgehogs, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] as well as the demonstration of the ability of the spike protein of Tylonecteris bat CoV HKU4 to bind to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor of MERS-CoV, have also suggested that these animals may be the hosts for the ancestor of MERS-CoV. [19] [20] [21] [22] Although MERS-CoV can be cultured and antibody detection methods are available, laboratory diagnosis and epidemiology studies of MERS-CoV infections are mainly achieved by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time qRT-PCR), using the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the region upstream of the envelope gene or the nucleocapsid (N) gene of MERS-CoV as the target. 1,23-27 However, the cost of real-time qRT-PCR is still high and such expertise may not be available, particularly in some clinical microbiology laboratories in the Middle East where most of the cases were identified. Because enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for antigen detection offers an inexpensive and user-friendly approach for laboratory diagnosis and epidemiological studies of respiratory viral infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome, 28, 29 we recently developed a monoclonal antibodybased capture ELISA for the detection of MERS-CoV N protein. 30 In this study, we describe the application of N protein ELISA, real-time qRT-PCR, isothermal amplification, virus isolation, and antibody detection in a cross-sectional epidemiological study of a dromedary dairy herd in Dubai after sudden death and the detection of MERS-CoV from a dromedary calf within the herd.",

This is in line with our observation that other dromedary calves with sudden death and MERS-CoV detected have also died of various diseases, such as salmonellosis, clostridial enterotoxemia, and isoporiosis instead of pneumonia, and MERS-CoV was detected in the animals only incidentally (unpublished data). Notably, the MERS-CoV strain isolated in the present study clustered with other patient strains from east Saudi Arabia and Qatar, including the one from a Korean patient who acquired infection in this area. This is in contrast to the MERS-CoV strains reported in our previous study in Dubai, 38 which formed another cluster not closely related to the present strain. This indicated that more than one strain of MERS-CoV is circulating in Dubai.",

The dromedaries in this study belonged to a closed herd that did not have contact with other herds because they were browsing in a confined area. It is believed that the virus could be circulating in the herd, which was probably infected in Saudi Arabia several years ago when the dams were calves.

This is in line with the observation that MERS-CoV infections occur almost exclusively in dromedary calves after their maternal antibodies have disappeared. In fact, we have tested samples from the nose, trachea, tonsil, lung, uterus, and placenta of more than 100 adult female dromedaries dispatched to our veterinary laboratory for necropsy, and all have shown negative results (unpublished data).",

Recently, we reported the development of a monoclonal antibody-based capture ELISA for MERS-CoV N protein and evaluated its specificity using nasopharyngeal specimens from patients with various common respiratory virus infections, including the four human CoVs, and its sensitivity using simulated nasopharyngeal specimens. 30 We argue that the ELISA may be used in animal field studies. In the present study, results of the N protein ELISA showed a concordance with those obtained from nucleic acid detection using dromedary nasal samples, indicating that the ELISA was highly specific. It is notable that there is one amino acid difference (L178V) between the N protein sequence of the MERS-CoV isolate of the present study and the original MERS-CoV isolate we used to generate the monoclonal antibodies for the N protein ELISA. This N protein ELISA would probably be useful in laboratories in the Middle East and North Africa, where resources and expertise may be limited. Further refinements of the test and the development of a rapid antigen detection kit for rapid diagnoses are warranted. ",
