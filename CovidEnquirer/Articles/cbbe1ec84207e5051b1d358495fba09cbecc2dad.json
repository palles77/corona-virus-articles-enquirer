Used either in combination with radiography or as a stand-alone imaging modality, ultrasound evaluation of the thoracic and abdominal body cavities is often a high-yield diagnostic undertaking. Many of the conditions that afflict neonatal foals are highly amenable to sonographic interrogation, including pneumonia and other changes in the lungs associated with sepsis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome , multiple organ dysfunction, and prematurity; colic arising from both medical and surgical causes; and urinary tract disorders. Sonographic imaging is not impaired by intracavitary fluid accumulation, and it reveals abnormalities of both soft tissue and bony origin. Adding imaging findings to physical examination and laboratory results aids the veterinarian in detection of intracavitary disease early in evaluation, and this translates into an improved level of both patient care and client care.",

From a purely imaging standpoint, ultrasound confers certain advantages that are useful in emergent scenarios: it is not necessary to take multiple views to determine the laterality of a lesion; there are no issues with magnification and loss of resolution with varying film-focal point distance; it is not necessary to obtain the images at peak inspiration; some points inaccessible to radiography (eg, the cranial mediastinum, pleural space, and lung fields lying ventral to the diaphragmatic crura) are easily and sensitively examined with ultrasound; and accumulation of fluid in body cavities or in the lung does not add a general opacity or loss of detail to the images but rather increases the acuity of the imaging. Accumulation of fluid in the pleural or peritoneal cavity, for instance, does not necessitate draining of the fluid and then reimaging so that the lung or visceral organs can be better evaluated, but reveals details of tissue form and function through the fluid-whether lung is atelectic or consolidated, or whether a given segment of intestine surrounded by peritoneal fluid is distended but contractile or distended and adynamic, for example-and also reveals clinically relevant characteristics of the fluid itselfwhether it occupies one or both hemothoraces, or whether it is acellular and consistent with a transudate or cell-dense and likely to be hemothorax or exudate, to site 2 examples.

            "text": "Acoustic waves are generated by high-frequency vibration of small crystals that have the quality of being piezoelectric. The word piezoelectric is a derivation of the Greek piezein, for press or squeeze, and applies here because a piezoelectric material is one in which charge develops across the surface of the crystal if the crystals are deformed (compressed) by the application of mechanical force. This effect is reversible, and the converse is also true: if electrical charge is applied to the crystal, it will deform slightly the surface configuration of the crystal. When electric current passes into a piezoelectric crystal, these surface deformations give rise to vibrations, and the vibrations generate high-frequency sound waves. Succinctly stated, a piezoelectric material takes electrical energy and converts it to wave energy and takes wave energy and converts it back to electrical energy. In ultrasound transducers, piezoelectric crystals (usually quartz) receive electrical current, vibrate at frequencies unique to their thickness and configuration, and direct pulses of the wave energy into the body. The acoustic waves travel longitudinally away from the transducer and penetrate tissues to depths determined by the wave frequency and tissue impedance. Some of the energy is scattered, and some is reflected back toward the transducer. The time it takes for an echoed pulse to arrive back at the transducer after being emitted is translated by the machine into depth. The ultrasound machine's hardware creates images on the basis of these returning wave echoes in the same way that bats' brains process returning echoes into an image of nearby insect prey. High-frequency sounds are emitted by the bat through its mouth or nose and travel through the air in waves, bouncing off any structures they encounter. After emitting the sound, the bat listens to the returning echoes. The bat's brain processes these echo patterns to construct an image in the same way that the brains of other animals create images from visual information. The processing is unconscious, but the bat perceives echoes that take a longer time to return as distance. If returning echoes reach the bat's left ear before its right ear, it perceives the insect to be to the bat's left. The echoes enable the animal to perceive an insect's vertical position, its size, and in which direction it is traveling, plus distinguish prey echoes from those it receives as background clutter. The return patterns of a pulse of acoustic echoes to the piezoelectric crystals likewise sensitively convey information about organs' depth, location, position, and density. 6, 7 Ultrasound waves are not qualitatively different from the sound waves that can be detected by animals and humans, but are simply higher frequencies than can be detected by the ossicles and other sound detection mechanisms in the middle and inner ear. Healthy young adult humans can hear sound frequencies in the range of 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz, or 20 kHz. Most equine diagnostic ultrasound is conducted using frequencies in the range of 2 to 12 MHz (1 MHz 5 1 million vibrations/s).",

            "text": "One of the physical properties of acoustic waves is that they are reflected at any interface where the acoustic impedance of 2 neighboring tissues differs significantly. This principle is relevant for areas in the body where a soft tissue (lower impedance) lies next to a tissue containing gas or to a bony structure (high impedance). Because the generating of a sonographic image depends on the acoustic waves entering and passing through a tissue before returning to the transducer, reflection of the waves at the surface of an organ prevents imaging of any part of that structure below the surface. An acoustic beam aimed at the lungs will traverse the chest wall, parietal pleura, and visceral pleura, and then encounter inflated alveoli. At that interface, the beam is bounced back to the transducer and yields no information about tissue deep to the first millimeter of alveolar tissue. The image yielded by this is a series of parallel white lines called reverberation artifact (Fig. 1) . In foals with pulmonary disease, lesions deep to a layer of aerated alveoli will be obscured from detection for this reason. Lesions that do extend to the periphery of the lung cause no reverberation artifact but instead yield detailed images. Similarly, in the intestinal tract, waves contacting gas at the bowel wall are reflected without providing an image of anything except the wall itself. Areas of subcutaneous emphysema preclude the imaging of any structures deep to the skin by the same concept.",

Transducers come in linear, curved, or curvilinear, and phased-array sector configurations. In linear array transducers, the crystals are arranged one next to the other, in a line. These probes create a rectangle-shaped image of high detail but shallow depth. Curved or curvilinear transducers also contain crystals placed next to each other in a linear fashion, but they have a curved footprint; these probes generate a wedge-shaped beam and image. Phased-array scanners contain a small group of crystals emitting a beam that is steered into a sectorshaped slice of tissue in front of the probe. These probes scan an area much wider than the probe's footprint, which is useful when tissues, like the heart, must be imaged through a restricted acoustic window such as the narrow intercostal space (ICS). In general, linear array transducers are used most to image tendons and internal reproductive organs, because the structures of interest are close to the probe surface and the probe shape is appropriate for insertion into a tubular space such as the rectum. Curvilinear transducers are most useful for the types of survey imaging done in neonatal foals and effectively penetrate the thoracic and abdominal body cavities. The phased-array sector scanners have a petite, square footprint that enables rotation of the probe so that 90 views can be obtained from the same acoustic window; these transducers are used in imaging of the heart, referred to as echocardiography.",

If the hair is clipped, ultrasound coupling gel is applied to the skin. Clipping the hair coat is generally recommended and facilitates higher image resolution, but the author prefers not to clip hair in most instances for examining structures in the body cavities, especially in cold climates, making application of generous volumes of rubbing alcohol necessary at times. Application of water to the hair will not yield the same result and is unhelpful for ultrasound imaging. The alcohol should be applied in a unidirectional fashion, in the direction of hair growth; rubbing against the nap will introduce air and defeats the purpose of applying the alcohol. Before applying it to the foal's skin, the rubbing alcohol should be warmed by preplacing 1 to 2 plastic bottles in a bucket of hot water (not by heating in a microwave oven) for a few minutes. Sloshing cold alcohol onto a foal's skin induces justifiable reaction and struggling and will also chill the foal. Allowing the alcohol to warm before applying it to the foal's thorax or abdomen makes the procedure more pleasant for patient and examiner alike.

Foals in which rib fractures are suspected should not be manipulated or handled in any manner that will compress the ribs or sternum. Attendants working with these foals should assist them to stand by lifting from the foal's stifles and elbows rather than by passing an arm under the chest or belly. Rib fractures are a significant source of morbidity and fatality in some practices 9 and appear to be most common in thoroughbred foals, foals born to a primiparous mare, and foals delivered with human assistance, with or without dystocia. [10] [11] [12] The soft tissue structures inside the thorax are viewed in the spaces between the ribs. In neonates, thoracic contents are sensitively surveyed with a microconvex linear transducer operating at frequencies of 4 MHz to 8 MHz. Linear transducers such as those used for transrectal imaging can also yield good images, although some find these images less intuitive to interpret. The author prefers to use a transducer with a microconvex footprint for surveying the organs inside the thorax and a linear transducer operating at 6 MHz to 10 MHz for imaging the ribs and other superficial structures. When a fracture is found, a higher frequency (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) can be used to view the site with maximal detail.

This area lies deep to the triceps musculature, and the examination commences with the transducer placed on the lateral aspect of the shoulder and parallel to the long axis of the ribs. The transducer should be held perpendicular to the skin surface. The thymus lying in the cranial mediastinal space can be seen by gently pulling the foal's forelimbs forward and aiming the transducer cranially from the third ICS, from either side. Ribs 1 through 4 form struts around the thoracic inlet and cranial mediastinum and lie deep to the triceps musculature. Rib 5 is usually the first rib that can be seen or palpated just caudal to the lateral head of the triceps when the forelimb is in a neutral position. Beginning with the transducer positioned dorsally in each rib interspace, as the examination proceeds caudally rib by rib, the examiner moves it distally slowly and smoothly, keeping the eyes on the ultrasound monitor. The pleural surface can be evaluated for thickness, and the pleural space is evaluated to ensure there is no fluid. The inner limit of the chest wall is delineated by the linear white echo that slides back and forth in the frame (actually dorsally and ventrally with inhalation and exhalation, respectively) with the foal's respiratory excursions. This movement may be subtle in weak, obtunded foals. The moving white line represents the visceral pleura, and the lung is the tissue lying immediately deep to the line. In healthy lung, the series of multiple parallel white lines representing reverberation artifact is seen just below the moving pleural line, yielding no real information about the pulmonary parenchyma. A lesion lying just deep or axial to a zone of inflated lung will be obscured from view.",

Immediate caudal to and in contact with the stomach lies the cranial pole of the spleen, which has a solid, stromal architecture and soft tissue echogenicity. The spleen should be more echogenic than the liver; the difference is easily appreciated where the caudal edge of the left liver lobe lies in contact with the stomach and cranial pole of the spleen, in ICS 8 to 10 on the left side. The spleen can be viewed from ICS 7 back to the paralumbar fossa area, depending on the state of splenic contraction or engorgement at the time of examination. The left kidney is a hypoechoic structure lying axial to the spleen from ICS 15 to the caudal border of the paralumbar fossa and can be recognized by the typical oblong shape and the corticomedullary anatomic pattern with the echogenic cortex, hypoechoic medulla, and hyperechoic renal pelvis. In the groin area ventral to the paralumbar fossa and in the area caudal to the fossa, segments of jejunum can be seen.

These pathways result in injury of both endothelial and epithelial cells in the lung such that the compartments these cells enclose, the pulmonary capillaries and alveoli, respectively, leak. The lower airspaces and lung interstitium flood with cells, proteinaceous fluid, necrotic material, and fibrin, causing rapidly progressive respiratory distress and hypoxemia, with attendant increases in morbidity and mortality. Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are clinical stages in the continuum of severe pulmonary dysfunction that develops with this flooding of fluid and cellular debris into the alveolar spaces and interstitium. 19, 20 Radiographic signs of the pulmonary edema of ALI and ARDS are a generalized opacity and loss of detail along with the appearance of a diffuse alveolar pattern with air bronchograms. Air bronchograms develop when gas-filled airways that have escaped the flooding affecting the alveolar and interstitial spaces stand out against the white, more radiodense areas of infiltration that they course through. 21, 22 Radiographic patterns reported in foals with ALI or ARDS include alveolar pattern and mixed alveolar 1 bronchointerstitial pattern. 23 The sonographic appearance of ALI-or ARDS-associated pulmonary edema on ultrasound is that of a diffuse, unbounded sheet of echogenic infiltration seen especially in the dorsocaudal lung fields. 24 This sonographic infiltrative pattern is highly recognizable but does not permit appreciation of tissue details (Fig. 4) .",

These lesions are called comet-tail lesions and are created by focal thickening, with cells and fluid, in the visceral pleura. In more established cases of pneumonia, the influx of cells and exudative fluid into the infected tissue causes consolidation, meaning that the lower airspaces take on soft tissue density rather than being filled with air. In this typical type of immune response and cell infiltration, neutrophils and other immune cells navigate toward the infection site by chemotaxis and exit the vascular space via the process of diapedesis, but the alveolar walls and pulmonary endothelium remain intact. Because there is no air to generate reverberation artifact at the lung surface, ultrasound can yield a detailed image of the normally unseen vascular and bronchial structures in an area of atelectic or consolidated lung (Fig. 6) . Although air bronchograms are not sonographically appreciable with pulmonary edema, as they are radiographically, air-filled lower bronchi and bronchioles can be seen with ultrasound in consolidated lung, appearing as linear or branching hyperechoic structures. The lobar shape and edged borders of the lungs can also be appreciated in lung that is consolidated or atelectic. Containment and organization of infection into an abscess are also sensitively detected sonographically, as long as the abscess borders extend to the pleural surface (Fig. 7) . Bright white gas echoes seen in areas of consolidated lung may represent the border between consolidated and aerated tissue or may represent islands of aerated alveoli or foci of gas-producing anaerobic bacteria. Pulmonary edema, as develops with left heart failure or from noncardiogenic causes such as NALI or NARDS, appears on ultrasound as a diffuse sheet of homogeneous echogenic material extending to the pleural surface, without boundaries or localizing characteristics (see Fig. 4) .",

Because in health the parietal and visceral pleurae maintain contact with each other during both the inflation and the deflation phases of lung movement, the pleural space is really only a potential space where the pressure is maintained at a subatmospheric level, and it should be empty save for a small volume of anechoic fluid that may or may not be detected sonographically. When seen, this small volume of fluid is often detected ventrally and caudal to the heart. 29 Imaging of the chest should reveal the glide sign in all areas, confirming that the dorsal part of the pleural space is devoid of gas and the ventral part is devoid of free fluid. This movement is called the glide sign. The glide sign will not be evident in the ventral aspect of the pleural cavity if there is accumulation of fluid and will be missing from the dorsal aspect of the pleural cavity if there is free gas, or pneumothorax. The presence of effusion or blood in the pleural cavity is easy to detect. With practice and repetition, free gas in the dorsal part of the pleural cavity can also be confirmed sonographically. The ultrasound probe should be placed in the dorsal-most extent of an ICS and held motionless while the lung excursions are observed; as it does inside alveoli, gas free in the pleural cavity will yield reverberation artifact on the monitor. With pneumothorax, however, the parallel white lines of artifact do not move back and forth with the lung, but rather are stationary. Moving the probe ventrally in the same ICS very slowly should reveal a point at which the gliding lung surface enters the ventral side of the frame. That point denotes the extent of the cap of free air in the pleural space. Pneumothorax does not always necessitate intervention; diagnosis of the site of escaping air and very close monitoring of the foal are obviously indicated, but clinical signs, anxiety level (the foal's), and blood gas values should be used to determine at what point or whether the air should be removed.",

Active bleeding in either body cavity has a signature sonographic appearance, deemed the smoke sign (Fig. 8) . The term refers to the flow pattern of blood exiting an artery or vein: the examiner can usually appreciate constant movement, with the echogenic free fluid swirling into circles and curliques around the lungs and heart. Once a thrombus has formed at the site of bleeding, stationary blood inside a body cavity quickly compartmentalizes, with the heavy, heme-laden erythrocytes settling and being reabsorbed for recycling by the body, and the anechoic serum remaining evident. Scanning at this point reveals only an accumulation of anechoic fluid. It should be mentioned that any fluids with a high cell content have a similar appearance on ultrasound: it is not always possible to differentiate blood from exudate. However, exudate inside a body has no mechanism for self-propagated movement, and the swirling, dynamic appearance of a moving cell-dense fluid inside the chest is strongly suggestive of, if not pathognomonic for, hemothorax.",

In the author's experience, hemothorax, hemoabdomen, or both should arouse suspicion of diaphragmatic laceration or rupture, and the cavitary hemorrhage may be appreciated as the sole finding, before abdominal organs actually move into the pleural cavity (Fig. 9) . Therefore, foals with hemothorax should be scanned carefully for rib fractures at initial evaluation, and the finding also warrants reexamination at least daily for several days afterward to ensure no such additional complications have arisen. The ends of the fractured ribs can be very sharp, and the lung surface is lacerated on these bony projections while sliding dorsally and ventrally during ventilation, leading to bleeding in the lung parenchyma, or pulmonary contusion (Figs. 10 and 11). The most dangerous complication of rib fractures arises when the involved ribs are ribs 4 through 7, those lying adjacent to the heart. Because of the arch of the proximal segments of the ribs, a complete fracture near the costochondral junction results in the distal fragment displacing axially, where its tip becomes an instrument of potentially lethal cardiac injury. Cardiac contusion or laceration is usually a fatal and terminal event; sonographic viewing of the heart beating against a sharp bone shard should prompt discussion of surgery with the owners about the option of immobilizing the fractures that put the foal at risk for cardiac puncture. Treatment recommendations for conservative management of fractured ribs involve enforced exercise restriction for varying lengths of time, often 14 to 21 days. Ultrasound is useful in following the organization and maturation of the hematomas that develop over the fractured rib Fig. 9 .

Particularly with gastrointestinal problems, which can be fulminant and rapidly changing, imaging is most helpful when the foal can be scanned serially over a certain time interval so that change can be detected. Also, the visual observations must be interpreted in light of concurrent changes in physical status, laboratory test values, and response to treatment. That said, foals with colic or other signs referable to the abdomen often do The most common indicator of gastrointestinal tract injury from sepsis or hypoxicischemic insult in a newborn foal is motility failure. Gastroduodenal ileus results in a distended, hypomotile stomach and duodenum filled with milk or residual fluid that is not proceeding down the tract (Fig. 14) . When the stomach is distended and atonic, the duodenum will usually be found in a similar state. Normal small intestinal mural thickness in foals is less than or equal to 3 mm, 13,32,33 but any time mural width is scrutinized, the qualitative appearance of the viscus wall should also be noted, even if the mural width is normal. Scanning a bowel segment with a higher-frequency probe is needed to distinguish the layers of the bowel wall, but if available, this should be performed to confirm the following normal echo patterns: hyperechoic mucosal surface-hypoechoic mucosa-hyperechoic submucosa-hypoechoic muscularis propriahyperechoic serosa. 29, 32 Appearance of hypoechoic edema in the bowel wall even before there is thickening of the overall dimensions may be seen with strangulating lesions, and the appearance of hyperechoic gas echoes within the wall layers is diagnostic for pneumatosis intestinalis and necrotizing enterocolitis. 34 Fig. 13 .

            "text": "Intestinal intussusception has been well described as a cause of colic in foals, but this disorder is more common in foals several months of age and older than in neonatal foals. Development of intussusception arises from differences in motility between neighboring segments of bowel and may be associated with many causes, including enteritis, administration of the prokinetic neostigmine, and parasitism. Intussuscepted intestine has a typical and easily recognizable sonographic appearance formed from the concentric layering of one bowel segment (the intussusceptum) inside an outer segment (the intussuscipiens; Fig. 17 ). 36, 37 Intussusceptions can be jejunojejunal, ileal-ileal, ileocecal, cecocolic, or cecocecal. 37 Clinical signs and severity of colic resulting from intussusception depend on length of involved bowel segment and whether the mesenteric blood vessels attached to the intussusceptum are obstructed. It is generally accepted that diagnosis of an intussusception automatically warrants surgical correction, and in older foals and horses, this is likely true. However, a recent report 33 detailing the existence of intussusceptions as an incidental finding in healthy, asymptomatic standardbred foals confirms that in neonates this is not always true. The findings in that study corroborate observations by the author, who has observed jejunojejunal intussusceptions arising in multiples in hospitalized foals and resolving spontaneously (unpublished data, 2012).",

            "text": "Meconium, a sterile concretion of intestinal cells and secretions, accumulates in the intestine during gestation and becomes sufficiently tenacious or inspissated in some foals that it becomes impacted in the large intestine or rectum and causes obstruction. In meconium impaction or retention, ultrasound is sensitive at detecting the impacted colon segment and the length or extent of the retained luminal material (Fig. 18) . Change in the appearance of the mass can be monitored sonographically after administration of enteral fluids or an enema. The affected colon segments and retained pellets or logs are usually detected in the caudal part of the abdomen. In the 2013 retrospective mentioned previously, 35 ultrasound was helpful in distinguishing large intestinal from small intestinal disease, and, within a portion of the intestine, types of disease. Distended, hypodynamic small intestine was seen more frequently with strangulating lesions, enterocolitis, and necrotizing enterocolitis than in those with meconium-associated colic. Within the large intestine, fluid distension was seen more frequently in foals with enterocolitis and necrotizing enterocolitis than in those with meconium problems. Thickening of the bowel wall was also sensitively detected: mural thickening in the small intestine was seen with strangulating obstructions, enterocolitis, and necrotizing enterolitis, but not with meconium-associated, transient medical colic, or forms of colic deemed \"other\". Thickening of the large intestine wall was seen only in foals with necrotizing enterocolitis. The fact that mural thickening was seen in foals with strangulating small intestinal lesions and those with inflammatory bowel lesions underscores how sonography is useful at detecting the site of abnormality but must be supported with physical examination and clinicopathologic data in the process of making a definitive diagnosis in these types of diseases. In the scenario of a colicky neonatal foal with thickened small intestine walls, for example, fever, a low white cell count, abnormal serum electrolyte values, and fluid accumulating in both the small and the large intestine would point toward enterocolitis. Severity of pain and response to pain controlling medications are also clinically useful. In this study, 35 neonates with a strangulating small intestine lesion (usually a volvulus) were significantly more likely to have severe pain and continuous pain than foals with medical causes of colic, and fewer foals with strangulating lesions responded to analgesics, compared with those that had medical colic.",

The 7 designated imaging windows were selected on the basis of earlier reports of frequent locations for detection of sonographic abnormalities in horses with colic. In this 2011 report of horses with colic, 38 use of the focused technique was quickly learned by individuals who did not have extensive ultrasound experience and enabled quick (mean examination time, 10.7 minutes) evaluation and acceptable sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values in horses whose clinical condition made performing a complete abdominal survey impossible. Use of this focused protocol in neonatal foals has not been reported, but will likely be investigated in these patients in the future.",

The umbilical cord should rupture cleanly a short distance from the foal's abdominal wall, leaving a 1 00 to 2 00 stump, 41 at which time the vascular structures inside the cord immediately contract and begin occluding further blood flow.

Upstream dilatation and pressure in the urachus and bladder created by cord impingement can predispose to higher-than-normal intravesicular volume, and bladder rupture, during parturition. A short umbilical cord increases traction on the placenta during parturition and may result in premature placental separation and death for the foal if a human attendant is not present. Short cord length can also create tension on the foal's umbilical area and urachus during and after transit through the birth canal, increasing the risk for tearing and urine leakage postpartum. A subjective appreciation for excessive umbilical cord length can be obtained during sonographic monitoring of the gestating mare. Umbilical cord abnormalities in utero thus can have an important influence on events involving the urogenital system in the neonate.",

Leaking of urine into the peritoneal cavity can result from rupture of the ureters, bladder, urethra, or urachus. Underlying conditions that can cause leak are parturition-associated trauma, congenital anomalies, postpartum traumatic injury, strenuous exercise, focal necrosis of the bladder wall, and urachal infection. 45, 46 Foals with uroperitoneum present with one or more of the following welldocumented clinical signs: colic, tenesmus secondary to constipation, tachycardia, altered mucous membrane appearance, dehydration, diarrhea, failure to nurse, lethargy, abdominal distension, frequent urinary posturing, and stranguria. Affected foals may also have rapid, shallow breathing secondary to hampering of diaphragmatic contraction by the volume of fluid in the abdomen. 47 Foals usually continue to pass some urine through the urethra as well as through the bladder rent into the abdomen, and it often takes several days after birth for the abdominal distension to become marked enough to prompt veterinary evaluation. When the rupture is in a ureter, the uroperitoneum develops more slowly and takes longer to manifest clinically. The hallmark sonographic appearance of uroperitoneum is voluminous anechoic to hypoechoic fluid in which viscera and mesentery are floating. Some foals with uroperitoneum also develop pleural effusion. 48 If the uroperitoneum is chronic or is associated with rupture of an infected or necrotic urachus, the peritoneal fluid will become more cellular in appearance with the influx of leukocytes. It is not always possible to make out the tear site in the bladder wall, but it can be appreciated in some instances.",

It is likely that more prevalent use of diagnostic ultrasound has resulted in diagnosis and intervention before the full gamut of biochemical changes can develop.

            "text": "Sepsis and focal infections, in the urogenital tract 53 and elsewhere in the body, are important risk factors for uroperitoneum, irrespective of whether a foal is hospitalized. 50, 51 In these foals, rupture of the bladder or urachal remnant is related to infection or necrosis rather than to traumatic rupture during parturition. It is not uncommon to detect uroperitoneum in a septic or bedridden foal one or more days into hospitalization when it was not present at admission. It is advisable to place and properly maintain an indwelling urinary catheter in nonambulatory foals to prevent urine stasis and pressure in the bladder, and broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage would be an expected part of the treatment regimen of any foal in this state. Daily to twice-daily sonographic imaging of the abdomen during the course of hospitalization enables detection of even a modest volume of free peritoneal fluid, days before abdominal distension, colic, or some of the other clinical signs become evident. The bladder is the most common site of rupture in the tract, followed by the urachus. In the 2005 retrospective study 51 cited in these paragraphs, the rent in the bladder wall was ventral at about the same frequency as it was dorsal. Excellent practical guides on scanning technique for the umbilical remnants are available. 54 The term navel ill has traditionally been used in reference to septic polyarthritis thought to result from pathogens' gaining entrance to the body through the umbilicus. Although the umbilicus can indeed serve as an access point for pathogens, it is now recognized that the gastrointestinal tract and other portals are often the chief entry point, and the umbilical structures can become infected by bacteremic showering along with other tissues. The most common reported bacterial isolates from omphalitis or omphalophlebitis specimens are Escherichia coli and Streptococcus zooepidemicus. 44, 55, 56 Infection with C perfringens has also been reported, as a result of either direct invasion from the environment or bacterial translocation from the intestinal tract. 55 A 2007 report 57 revealed Clostridium sordelli as a cause of fulminant omphalitis, peritonitis, and death in 8 foals.",

Dehiscence and rerupture in the few days following surgery are not uncommon, and routine placement of an indwelling urinary catheter for 3 to 5 days after surgery may keep the bladder wall free of tension and challenge to the suture line. Conservative management of bladder ruptures also involves placement of an indwelling catheter and a long-term regimen of antimicrobials and has yielded favorable results. 58 It is tempting to surmise that this approach is most likely to yield success when the rent is not large and when it involves the dorsal aspect of the bladder. This option may be feasible when the owners are not able to finance abdominal surgery, and the bladder rent involves the dorsal wall and is modest in size. Nonsurgical management of bladder rupture in 4 adult horses was recently reported. 59 Ultrasound imaging can distinguish between other problems affecting the lower urinary tract and resulting in clinical signs that overlap with those of uroperitoneum. Hematoma formation within the bladder, ascribed to tearing of the intra-abdominal portion of the umbilicus, has been reported and is not an uncommon finding. 60 In some instances, however, the resulting thrombus can be large and obstruct urine flow, leading to signs of stranguria in the foal.",
