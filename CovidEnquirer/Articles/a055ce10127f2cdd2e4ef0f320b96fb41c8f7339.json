Sharpless et al. studied the synthesis of tetrazoles by Cu-catalyzed 'click reaction' of nitriles with azides. 6 For example, 1-substituted-5-tosyltetrazoles were prepared from tosyl cyanide (TsCN); the tosyl group was subsequently elaborated by nucleophilic substitution reactions. The 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of diazomethane with TsCN has been reported to give 1,2,3triazines. 7 The [4 + 2] cycloaddition of nitriles with 1,3-dienes (hetero-Diels-Alder reaction) has been reported to give dihydropyridines which often undergo elimination or oxidation reactions to the corresponding pyridine derivatives. Noteworthy, intermolecular reactions of this type are relatively rare and highly activated nitriles, such as arylsulfonylnitriles and cyanoformates, have to be employed. 8 Breitmaier and R\u00fcffer reported 8f an efficient synthesis of functionalized pyridines by cyclization of 1,3-butadienes, including 2-silyloxy-1,3-butadienes, with tosylcyanide 9 (TsCN). Pyridines have been prepared also by cyclization of pyran-2-ones with TsCN with extrusion of carbon dioxide. 10 Recently, the synthesis of 1azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-1-enes by cyclization of 2-silyloxycyclohexa-1,3-diene with TsCN has been reported. 11 Recently, we reported, 12 based on the work of Breitmaier, the hetero-Diels-Alder reaction of 1,3-bis(trimethylsilyloxy)-1,3-butadienes 13 with TsCN. Herein, we report full details of these studies and a considerable extension of the scope. The reactions reported herein allow a convenient synthesis of a variety of functionalized 4-hydroxy-2-(arylsulfonyl)pyridines which are not readily available by other methods.",

The best yields were obtained when a neat mixture of the starting materials was allowed to slowly warm from -78\u00b0C to ambient temperature. A complex mixture was obtained when the reaction was carried out at elevated temperatures or when a solvent was added. An aqueous work-up using NH 4 Cl or HCl was necessary.

The reaction conditions were optimized. The reactions of dienes 1a,b,e,f, prepared from unsubstituted bketoesters, were carried out at 20\u00b0C (the starting materials were added at -78\u00b0C and the mixture was subsequently warmed to 20\u00b0C during 30 min. The reaction time was in the range of 24-28 h. A considerable extension of the reaction time was necessary for the less reactive dienes 1c and 1d derived from pentane-2,4dione and 1-methoxy-pentane-2,4-dione, respectively. In these cases, the starting materials were added at 0 rather than -78\u00b0C. The reactions were carried out at 20\u00b0C. An increase of the temper-ature resulted in partial decomposition. The reactions of dienes 1g-i and 1m-o were carried out at 45\u00b0C (48 h). The arylthiosubstituted dienes 1j-l,p solidify at 20\u00b0C. Since all reactions reported herein had to be carried out without solvent (neat) it proved to be advantageous to carry out the reactions of 1j-l,p at 60\u00b0C (96 h).",

            "text": "Noteworthy, the yields of pyridines 3i-v were considerably higher than those of 3a-h. This can be explained by the cisoid conformation of 1,3-bis(silyloxy)-1,3-butadienes 1g-s, due to the presence of the substituent located at the central carbon atom. The reaction of 2a with 1,3-bis(silyloxy)-1,3-butadienes containing a substituent located at the terminal carbon atom proved to be unsuccessful, presumably due to steric reasons. The reaction of 1a with ethoxycarbonyl cyanide was also unsuccessful, due to the low reactivity of the latter compared to 2a. No conversion was observed when the reaction was carried out at 20 and 60\u00b0C. Forcing conditions (neat, 120\u00b0C) resulted in decomposition and 1,5 O ? C TMS shift of the 1,3-bis(silyl enol ether) to give a 3-silyloxy-4-silylcrotonate. 26 The structures of the products were elucidated by spectroscopic methods (2D NMR). The structures of 3l and 3r were independently confirmed by X-ray crystal structure analyses (Figs. 1 and 2). 27 All arylsulfonyl-pyridines were tested towards their antimicrobial activity. The agar diffusion test method was used to evaluate the influence on the growth of the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis as well as the Gram-negative Escherichia coli and the yeast Candida maltosa. The results of that screening are summarized in Table 2 . Some of the compounds showed considerable activities against S. aureus and B. subtilis. In this screening no activity against the Gram-negative E. coli was observed. Only 3o showed a weak activity against the yeast C. maltosa. Compound 3o is also among the most active derivatives in this study. To evaluate the antimicrobial potential of the most active compounds minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined. The results of these investigations are summarized in Table 3 . Derivatives 3i,j,o, containing a halogen atom located at the pyridine moiety, show the best activities. A good activity was also observed for derivative 3n containing a tolylthio moiety.",

In contrast to this observation, the MIC of 3n, 3u and 3v are lower compared to the chlorinated compounds 3i and 3o. A possible explanation would be a better bioavailability in case of the non-chlorinated derivatives in the dilution assay. All compounds show much lower activity compared to Ampicillin in this study.
