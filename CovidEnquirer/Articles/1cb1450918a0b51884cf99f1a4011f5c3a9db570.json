This was associated with increasing carbapenem resistance reaching 35-54%, and by a dramatic increase in carbapenem consumption. Inhospital fatality rates ranged between 47% and 58% and were significantly higher than those seen with other nosocomial Gram-negative pathogens. A. baumannii was not restricted to intensive care units, but had spread to all hospital wards. Multi-drug-resistant A. baumannii has the potential to reach endemicity in hospitals and warrants more vigorous and innovative efforts to limit its spread.",

The features of the genus that allow for its saprophytic existence assist in its spread in hospitals, namely the ability to survive in the inanimate environment and a striking capacity to develop antibiotic resistance.",

It is possible that the high mortality rate in our study can be explained by more severe underlying diseases in our patient population. Another possible explanation is the association with pneumonia as the source of infection, which was two to four times more frequent in A. baumannii compared with other Gram-negative nosocomial pathogens.
