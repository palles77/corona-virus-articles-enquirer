Material and methods: This study included 16 patients of different clinical subtypes of psoriasis. IL-18 gene expression analysis was performed using realtime quantitative PCR. Three biopsies were obtained from each patient. Two were taken from the lesional psoriatic skin and from uninvolved skin before starting treatment. A third lesional skin biopsy was taken at the end of two months' treatment course. The treatment was in the form of topical steroids or oral systemic methotrexate. Results: Of all 16 studied patients significantly increased IL-18 expression was noted in keratinocytes from psoriatic lesions before and after treatment when compared to keratinocytes from uninvolved skin (P = 0.001 and 0.002 respectively). The IL-18 expression in the skin lesions after treatment was significantly lower than lesional skin before treatment (P = 0.023). In psoriatic skin lesions of all studied patients IL-18 expression was significantly correlated with disease duration (r = 0.40 and P = 0.01) and clinical severity of psoriasis (r = 0.72 and P = 0.001). Conclusions: Increased IL-18 expression in keratinocytes from psoriatic lesions of our patients and its correlation with disease duration and severity supported the concept which views psoriasis as a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease. This could establish therapeutic and preventive approaches for psoriasis that ultimately lead to improved outcomes for patients.",

            "text": "Interleukin-18 was first described as an interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) inducing factor. In general, IL-18 induction of IFN-\u03b3 is similar to that of IL-12, when it is a sole cytokine. IL-18 induces low levels of IFN\u03b3, but in the presence of co-stimulants, IFN-\u03b3 production is greatly enhanced [6] . However, because antibodies to IL-18 also reduced the hepatotoxicity of endotoxaemia, IL-18 was considered to possess other biological properties beyond that of inducing IFN-\u03b3 [7] . IL-18 activates T cells to synthesize IL-2, GM-CSF, and TNF-\u03b1. There are also reports that IL-18 suppresses the production of IL-10 and does not induce the production of IL-1Ra. In general, the ability of IL-18 to induce different cytokines depends on the cellular targets [8] . Flisiak et al. confirmed an association between plasma IL-18 concentration and psoriasis severity. Moreover, it was shown that combined measurement of IL-18 and TGF-beta1 in plasma can be considered as a possible biomarker of psoriasis activity [9] . Kato et al. indicated that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter of the interleukin-18 gene is associated with the presence of psoriasis, but not atopic dermatitis. This suggests that the SNP is associated with susceptibility to psoriasis vulgaris, presumably by affecting the production of IL-18 [10] .",

This supports the concept viewing psoriasis as a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease. Krueger [18] reported, in his study on a large series of skin biopsies, increased protein expression in lesional as opposed to non-lesional skin samples. Other investigators stated that lesional skin might be the source of the elevated plasma levels of IL-18 [19] . In the present work quantitative PCR using mRNA taken from uninvolved skin revealed low but detectable levels of IL-18 mRNA expression. This finding is consistent with previous studies showing that human keratinocytes are capable of synthesizing low levels of IL-18 mRNA even under non-stimulated conditions [20] . Chang et al. [21] found that genes specifically modulated in uninvolved skin play a major role in triggering disease progression, and in being the first candidate for early disease diagnosis or development of new therapies. This finding could allow selection of the treatment regimen for individual patients.",

They found that in patients treated with calcipotriol, IL-19 and IL-20 mRNA expression levels in lesional psoriatic skin were reduced after 14 days, but the reduction became statistically significant only after 28 days. So the timing for mRNA expression analysis could affect the degree of significance. This is further supported by studies demonstrating a decrease of IL-18 levels after narrowband UVB therapy together with other parameters' characteristics for the T helper 1 (Th1) response [23] . Apart from stimulating the Th1 response, IL-18 can regulate the Th2 response depending on the local cytokine network. IL-12 enhances IFN-\u03b3 production induced by IL-18, whereas IL-18 alone induces IL-4 and IL-13 production [24] .",

This could be supported by its correlation with clinical severity and disease duration, and reduction of its expression after treatment. The decreased expression after treatment was not to an extent indicating that the skin had returned to normal. The small size of the study population and the heterogeneous group of patients participating in the study preclude the drawing of firm conclusions. Future studies on genes involved and array-based technologies should allow confirmation of the results obtained. Also further studies are recommended to try other lines of treatment for psoriasis. One of these lines of therapy is to try r-h IL-18 BP to neutralize IL-18 activity on a wide scale that will ultimately lead to improved outcomes for patients.",
