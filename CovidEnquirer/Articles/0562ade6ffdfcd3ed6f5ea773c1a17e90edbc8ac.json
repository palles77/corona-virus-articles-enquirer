[5] [6] [7] This technology has allowed the recovery of viruses that have been diffi cult to detect by conventional methods. 8 For example, PCR is three to fi ve times as sensitive as cell culture for detecting rhinoviruses. 9,10 Figure 31-1 shows the viral identifi cation breakdown in three recent studies of children 5, 11, 12 in different countries over the winter viral season using PCR techniques. This fi gure illustrates the differences between studies in patient sampling and methods and the consequent differences in results. However, in all three studies, rhinovirus and RSV are the dominant viruses, with the relative proportions of each differing even between the two studies in infants (studies A and B). Mixed viral infections, particularly with rhinovirus, are common. Finally, studies fi nd only the organisms they look for-only study C tested for bocavirus.",

In these regions, RSV occurs predominantly in the rainy season, whereas infl uenza activity occurs throughout the year with a marked peak in activity during the dry season and a lesser peak during the rainy season. 27,28 Seasons of both higher and lower temperature have been associated with these viruses in different countries. 27 The reasons for the seasonality of respiratory virus infections and their variation by latitude are not clear. More important than the environmental conditions themselves may be their effect on behavior. Seasons when people spend more time indoors, in closer contact with other people (colloquially called \"closed-in season\" in some regions), will favor more rapid person-to-person transmission.",

Similarly, hPIV infections occur at an older peak age than RSV. Human parainfl uenza virus-1 causes LRIs predominantly in infants aged 7 to 36 months, with peak infection occurring in the second and third years of life. The peak infection of hPIV-2 occurs in the second year of life, but hPIV-3 differs in that it infects infants younger than 6 months and most children experience infection in the fi rst year of life. All age groups are at risk of infection from infl uenza type A and B viruses, but preschoolage children in day care and school-age children have the highest infection rates. 31 The very young, the elderly, and those with chronic conditions experience more severe disease. Rhinoviruses and coronaviruses commonly cause URI and infect individuals many times throughout their lives. Rhinoviruses are also clearly associated with LRI in children, but their role remains to be elucidated. 32",

The authors estimated that between 1.6 and 2.2 million children died of ARI in 2000 and that 40% of these deaths occurred in Africa and 30% occurred in Southeast Asia. Mortality from ARI in excess of 25% of total under-5 deaths was estimated for Afghanistan, Sierra Leone, and Niger. The regions with the lowest proportions of deaths due to ARI were in Western Europe, North America, and Australasia. Other respiratory deaths in young children, estimated for 1998, fell into the following categories: upper respiratory infection and otitis media-37,000, neonatal pneumonia-215,500, pertussis-287,000, measles-594,700, and AIDS-associated ARI-87,500. 69 Table 31 -2 gives an updated summary of mortality due to ARI from the WHO 2005 report 70 by region averaged for the years 2000 to 2003.

These fi gures are based on Rudan and colleagues 65 and the recent UNICEF/ WHO report. 68 If for the moment we ignore the potential errors due to the limitations mentioned above, it would seem that 90% of the child deaths from ARI occur in the developing world, with 75% of them in Africa and Southeast Asia.

They summarized three community studies and 12 facility-based studies. The results were consistent across all studies showing a major association between death from ARI and low weightfor-age (W/A) Z-scores or median W/A less than 80% of median. The odds ratios, risk ratios, or relative risks of dying from respiratory infection compared with that for normally nourished children ranged very widely from single fi gures up to an odds ratio of 26 for W/A Z-score = \u22122.0 (compared with >0) in a Brazilian study and an adjusted relative risk of 27 for children whose W/A was less than 60% of the local reference median (compared to \u226590%) in a Philippines study. All studies that analyzed risks by degree of malnutrition found a dose-response effect. Figure 31 -8, taken from Victora and colleagues 76 and based on Kirkwood and colleagues, 77 shows that 84% of deaths from pneumonia occur in the fi rst 18 months of life and indicates the potential impacts of nutritional problems at different ages. Victora and colleagues' estimated reduction in pneumonia mortality by region and by intervention is shown in Table 31 -5.",

In the presence of herd immunity over 300,000 deaths (83% of deaths) and 2.5 million cases (85% of cases) might be prevented.

Paper presented at Global Reduction of Hib Disease Meeting,September 22-25, 2002, Scottsdale, Arizona.)   viruses are clinically relevant in humans. Infl uenza B viruses have a human reservoir, whereas infl uenza A viruses have a reservoir in aquatic birds and are antigenically diverse. Infl uenza A viruses have two major antigenic surface proteins, the hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). We recognize 16 different H antigens (named H1-16) and nine different N antigens (N1-9), and unique combinations of H and N antigens are called infl uenza A subtypes. All of these subtypes have been found circulating among wild aquatic birds, their primary natural reservoir. From time to time, these viruses cross the species barrier, with some becoming established in another avian or animal species. In the past century, the infl uenza A subtypes H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2 have been able to infect and establish sustained transmission among humans, whereas the H5N1 subtype has become established in domestic poultry(Fig. 31-13). The constant evolution of infl uenza A and B viruses occurs through the accumulation of mutational changes in the H and N antigens. This antigenic drift leads to the selection of new variants and regular epidemics of disease, while reassortment of the H and N genes of different infl uenza A subtypes (antigenic shift) leads to the emergence of a novel virus and pandemic infl uenza.105   However, it is becoming clear that the emergence of human infl uenza virus lineages can occur through avenues other than drift and shift. 106",

In 1997, the infection of 18 humans, of whom 6 died, with an avian H5N1 virus raised the level of global concern of a possible human infl uenza pandemic. In 1999, H9N2 avian infl uenza infected two children in Hong Kong and there were other cases in mainland China. In 2003, H5N1 and H9N2 infections were confi rmed in Hong Kong, while in the Netherlands, a large avian infl uenza outbreak involved an H7N7 virus. Up to 1000 cases among farmers and poultry workers occurred. Since late 2003, outbreaks of avian H5N1 have been reported among poultry in Southeast Asia. 122 Human infections and deaths were initially reported in Vietnam and Thailand. This virus has become endemic in domestic poultry in Asia and has spread globally after infecting migratory waterfowl. 123 Subsequently, there have been reports of human infections in an increasing number of countries. Clusters of human infection are small, suggesting that if human-to-human transmission is occurring, it is very ineffi cient.As this H5N1 virus continues to circulate in and be spread by domestic and migratory avian species, there is an ongoing risk of human infection and a threat of the emergence of a human pandemic virus. Whether the H5N1 virus or one of the other potential pandemic subtypes (H2, H5, H7 viruses) will adapt to effi cient human-to-human transmission remains unknown. Currently, no mechanism of prediction of the emergence of novel infl uenza A viruses exists, highlighting the importance of the ongoing global surveillance of animal and human infl uenza viruses by the WHO.
