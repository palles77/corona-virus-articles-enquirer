To express the membrane (M) protein of SARS-CoV at high-level in vitro, the M gene fragment was amplified and cloned it into the Pichia Pastoris expression vector pPICZ\u2423A. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis of the induced products of recombinant yeast transformant indicated that successful high-level expression of M protein was achieved, and that the expression product was similar antigenically to the natural protein. Purified recombinant M protein was used subsequently as an ELISA antigen for detection of eight serum samples screened previously by whole virus ELISA and immunofluorescence assay, and consistent results were obtained. These findings suggest that the recombinant M protein may be useful as a diagnostic reagent.",

The transmission of SARS occurs mainly by direct contact, and its incubation period is 2-7 days. Infection is usually characterized by high fever, which is followed a few days, later by a dry non-productive cough and shortness of breath, and may progress to generalized interstitial infiltrates in the lung. Death from progressive respiratory failure occurs in between 3-10% of cases . At present, no effective therapy or vaccine is available.",

The virions are 80-140 nm in diameter, with 20-40 nm complex surface projections surrounding the periphery. Hemagglutinin esterase type glycoprotein projections were not seen (Ksiazek et al., 2003) . The genome of SARS-CoV is a single-stranded, positive-sense polyadenylated RNA molecule of approximately 29,727 nucleotides. The genomic organization is typical of coronaviruses, having the characteristic gene order [5 -replicase (rep) , spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N)-3 ] and short untranslated regions at both termini. The SARS-CoV rep gene is predicted to encode two polyproteins that undergo co-translational proteolytic processing. There are four open reading frames (ORF) downstream of rep that are predicted to encode the four structural proteins S, E, M and N, which are common to all known coronavirus. Additionally, SARS-CoV also encodes several non-structural proteins . 0166 The clinical case definition of SARS is essentially one of fever and pneumonia, with or without a contact history. There are many causes of pneumonia and in the absence of a definite history of contact with other patients with SARS, therefore, it is difficult to differentiate SARS from other causes of pneumonia in clinic diagnosis. Laboratory tests that can confirm a diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection early in the course of the illness are, therefore, a critical clinical need (Riley et al., 2003) . Since the outbreak of SARS in 2003, several laboratory diagnostic methods have been established, including real-time RT-PCR assay, whole-virus-based immunofluorescence assay (IFA), recombinant protein-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunochromatographic tests, antigencapturing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Western blot (WB) assay. These methods were critically important for controlling the transmission of SARS; furthermore, many new laboratory diagnostic methods are being developed (Poon et al., 2003 (Poon et al., , 2004 Shi et al., 2003; Guan et al., 2004; He et al., 2004) .",

Both the lack of understanding and effective methods to control the virus means that the threat of SARS still exists, and therefore, there is an urgent need to develop effective vaccines and anti-viral drugs. The key role of the M protein in coronavirus assembly, budding and inducing virus neutralization make it an attractive target for the development of vaccines and drugs, as well as for effective diagnostic reagents.

In these assays, however, the viral nucleic acid and anti-gens needed were commonly prepared from live pathogen, so there is a strong associated risk of individual exposure to this pathogen. Compared with these methods, preparing viral antigens by expression in vitro is both easier and safer. Among the proteins encoded by the SARS coronavirus, the M protein can induce an immunological response and thus may be used for detection of SARS-CoV antibodies. ELISA with the expressed recombinant M protein of canine coronavirus has been reported, and was demonstrated to be a valid and effective detection method (Elia et al., 2003) . In order to evaluate whether our expressed recombinant M protein could be applied as a diagnostic antigen for SARS, we used it as an ELISA antigen to detect eight collected SARS-positive and SARS-negative human sera.
