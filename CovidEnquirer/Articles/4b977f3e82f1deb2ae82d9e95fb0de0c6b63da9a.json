            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is the cause of an economically important swine disease that has been devastating the swine industry since the late 1980s. Accumulating evidences have revealed that PRRSV infection fails to induce type I interferon (IFN-\u2423/\u2424), which are normally induced rapidly during virus replication in virus-infected cells. However, the potential mechanisms remain largely unclear. In this study, we showed that PRRSV infection activated the signal transduction components of NF-B and AP-1, but not of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), an essential IFN-\u2424 transcription factor. Furthermore, PRRSV infection significantly blocked synthetic dsRNA-induced IFN-\u2424 production and IRF3 nuclear translocation. To better understand the upstream signaling events that suppress IRF3 activation, we further investigated the roles of individual components of the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-and Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)-mediated signaling pathway for IFN-\u2424 production during PRRSV infection. We observed that PRRSV infection significantly inhibited dsRNA-induced IRF3 activation and IFN-\u2424 generation by inactivating IFN-\u2424 promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1), an adaptor molecule of RIG-I. In contrast, PRRSV infection only partially reduced the activation of TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-\u2424 (TRIF), an adaptor molecule of TLR3. Our results suggest that PRRSV infection suppresses production of IFN-\u2424 primarily by interfering with the IPS-1 activation in the RIG-I signaling pathway.",

PRRSV is a single-stranded RNA virus, whose genome is duplicated into dsRNA during replication. The common intermediate dsRNA can trigger a cascade of cellular events, leading to secretion of type I IFN. Initially, the pathogen-associated molecular pattern in dsRNA is recognized by multiple pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and cytoplasmic RNA helicase, such as retinoic acid-inducible protein I (RIG-I) or melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) (Yoneyama et al., 0161-5890/$ -see front matter \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.molimm.2008.01.028 2004). TLR3 can detect either extracellular dsRNA or dsRNA within vesicles. Activation of TLR3 by dsRNA then leads to the recruitment of the adaptor molecule TRIF through MyD88independent pathway (Fitzgerald et al., 2003) . Alternatively, RIG-I or MDA5 serves as intracellular dsRNA receptors via DexD/H-box helicase domains. Caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) of RIG-I or MDA5 interact with the counterpart domains of IFN-\u2424 promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1, also known as MAVS/VISA/Cardif) (Kawai et al., 2005) . Despite utilizing the different adaptors, both pathways converge to activate the two downstream kinases, Tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and inhibitor of B kinase (IKK), resulting in the phosphorylation and activation of transcription factors, including IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), NF-B, and AP-1 (Fitzgerald et al., 2003) . The coordinate activation of these transcription factors results in the formation of a transcriptionally competent enhanceosome that induces type I IFN production and downstream inflammatory cytokines (Thanos and Maniatis, 1995) .",

            "text": "Initiation of IFN synthesis typically involves binding of specific transcription factors, which collectively comprise the transcriptional enhanceasome, to the positive regulatory domains in the IFN-\u2424 gene promoter. These transcription factors include NF-B, AP-1, and members of the IFN regulatory factors (IRF) family, such as IRF3 (Thanos and Maniatis, 1995) . Using plasmid constructs with the individual binding sites of these transcription factors linked to luciferase reporter genes, we showed that transcription factor NF-B and AP-1 were activated by PRRSV infection, whereas the activity of transcription factor IRF3 was significantly inhibited (Fig. 3) , indicating that inhibition of IFN-\u2424 transcription by PRRSV occurs through a mechanism involving IRF3 activity. Many viruses interact with IRF3 directly to inactivate IRF3 function, thereby suppressing IFN-\u2424 transcription. For example, rotavirus NSP1 and human papillomavirus E6 bind directly to IRF3 (Barro and Patton, 2005; Ronco et al., 1998) . PRRSV, however, appeared to employ different mechanisms. It did not inhibit IRF3-induced expression of the IFN-\u2424 reporter gene with wtIRF3 or IRF3(5D) in this study. TBK1 and IKK are elements upstream of IRF3 in the signaling pathway. PRRSV infection did not alter IRF3 activity in cells overexpressing TBK1 or IKK. In addition, comparable IFN-\u2424 promoter activities were obtained in cells overexpressing IRF3, IRF3(5D), TBK1, and IKK in mock-or PRRSV-infected cells. Poly(IC)-induced IFN-\u2424 reporter gene expression, however, was significantly decreased in PRRSV-infected cells. Generally, poly(IC) is sensed by host's pattern recognition receptors, such as RIG-I and TLR3. The latter then recruit the corresponding adaptor molecule to relay the signal to TBK1 and IKK. PRRSV significantly dampened IFN-\u2424 reporter gene expression stimu-lated by poly(IC) in cells overexpressing TBK1/IKK. Based on these observations, we reasoned that PRRSV did not interact with IRF3 and even did not interfere with TBK1/IKK kinases directly, and that the target of PRRSV interaction existed upstream of IRF3 and TBK1/IKK in the signaling pathway.",

In this study, IFN-\u2424 production induced by overexpression of RIG-I, the dsRNA-sensing protein, is significantly inhibited by PRRSV, suggesting that PRRSV may target RIG-I directly or a component of the signaling pathway downstream of RIG-I and upstream of TBK1/IKK. To identify the target which PRRSV interacts with, we focused on the IPS-1 molecule, a component between RIG-I and TBK1/IKK in the signaling pathway. We showed here that IPS-1-induced IFN-\u2424 production was blocked in PRRSV-infected cells (Fig. 6) whereas elements downstream of IPS-1 remained intact.

As a result, viral induction of IFN-\u2424 production was interrupted. By doing so, PRRSV may get an opportunity to evade the innate immune response. Certainly, apart from RIG-I and TLR3 signaling pathways, PRRSV may also use other pathways, such as PKR, to evade the innate immune response. Understanding of those mechanisms would help accelerate development of improved vaccines or better methods to control PRRSV infection more effectively.",
