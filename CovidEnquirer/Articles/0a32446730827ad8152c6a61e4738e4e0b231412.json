Although the timeline of immunological alterations in sepsis is not well understood, the suggestive evidence demonstrated that the development of sepsis involves two distinct stages, an initial cytokine storm (hyper-inflammation) and subsequent immunosuppression (hypo-inflammation), which exist concomitantly and dominate in different stage (Hotchkiss, Monneret & Payen, 2013a; Hutchins, Unsinger, Hotchkiss & Ayala, 2014) . The uncontrolled cytokine storm is responsible for deaths occurring within the first few days, whereas immunosuppression predominantly causes mortality during the later stage of sepsis. In fact, more than 70% of patients die after the first three days of sepsis, which might due to the increased susceptibility to weakly virulent pathogens or opportunistic bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa), indicating a failure of the host to eradicate invading pathogens (Hotchkiss, Monneret & Payen, 2013a; Skrupky, Kerby & Hotchkiss, 2011) .

Although contradictory findings have been reported (Ho et al., 2016) , accumulating evidence suggest that autophagy plays a key role in sepsis, and has been considered a potential target for sepsis-induced immunosuppression (Ren, Zhang, Wu & Yao, 2017) . It is promising to focus on autophagy axis to unveil the mechanism of sepsis-induced immunosuppression and discover the novel immunoregulating therapies for sepsis. Artesunate (AS) is an effective and reliable anti-malarial drug with low toxicity (Burrows, Chibale & Wells, 2011; Clark, White, S, Gaunt, Winstanley & Ward, 2004) , which possesses several interesting effects such as anti-inflammation and other effects (Efferth, Dunstan, Sauerbrey, Miyachi & Chitambar, 2001; Li et al., 2008; Miranda et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2017) . Previously, we showed that AS protects septic animals by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine release in cytokine storm stage (Li et al., 2008) , suggesting that AS could exhibit anti-inflammatory activity during the cytokine storm phase of sepsis.

In CLP mice unchallenged with PA, the levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 were extremely low in the serum, spleen, and lungs. However, their levels increased significantly in AS-treated CLP mice (Figure 1c) . Furthermore, the cytokines levels in CLP mice challenged with PA were also much lower in contrast with sham mice challenged with PA, demonstrating that bacterial challenge could not induce pro-inflammatory cytokines release in sepsis-induced immunosuppressed mice. Importantly, AS treatment significantly augmented the cytokine levels (Figure 1d ), indicating that AS could increase cytokine levels in sepsis-induced immunosuppressed mice. Subsequently, the results showed that the bacterial loads obviously increased in the tissues of CLP mice challenged with PA compared with those in the sham mice, demonstrating that the CLP mice had a lower bacterial clearance ability. However, AS significantly decreased the bacterial load ( Figure 1e) , suggesting AS could protect sepsis-induced immunosuppression by increasing pro-inflammatory cytokine release and decreasing the bacterial load.",

Compared with cells treated with only 100 ng/mL LPS treatment (LPS cells), tolerance cells pretreated with 5 ng/mL LPS and followed by 100 ng/mL LPS released much less TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 ( Figure 2c ). However, AS exhibited a dose-dependent enhancement of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 release in tolerance cells ( Figure 2d) . The results showed the bacterial loads in LPS tolerance cells increased relative to LPS cells at 2 h after PA challenge. Significantly, AS decreased the bacteria load in tolerance cells ( Figure 2e ). Noteworthily, since the concentrations of LPS (2.5 -200 ng/mL) and AS(0.625 -40 \u03bcg/ml) used in the experiment had no effect on cell viability, the above effect was not related to the toxicity of LPS and AS on cell activity ( Figure S1a ) (Li et al., 2008) . Subsequent, the human monocyte cell line THP-1 and THP-1 derived macrophages were employed to confirm whether there is a similar effect in human cells. The identical results in the mRNA levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 and bacterial clearance in THP-1 cells and THP-1 derived macrophages were obtained (Figure 2f, g) . These results were consistent with the findings in vivo, demonstrating that AS might reverse sepsis-induced immunosuppression through enhancing pro-inflammatory cytokines release and bacterial clearance by macrophages.",

Therefore, nuclear translocation of VDR and its subsequent effect on target gene ATG16L1 was investigated firstly. The immunoblotting and immunostaining results showed that VDR protein level dramatically increased in the nucleus of LPS tolerance cells compared with LPS cells, which could be reversed by AS (Figure 4a, b) . Secondly, a ChIP assay results showed that AS induced binding of VDR to the promoter of ATG16L1 as analyzed by semiquantitative PCR and RT-PCR in LPS tolerance cells (Figure 4c, d) . Together, these data showed that AS's effect is closely related to the transcriptional regulation of VDR on ATG16L1.

However, AS-increasing ATG16L1 level in LPS tolerance cells was abrogated by overexpression of VDR ( Figure 4g ).

Herein, co-IP and fluorescent co-localization experiments were performed. The results showed that the associated NF-\u03baB p65 level in cytoplasm protein had no significant change in the medium cells, LPS cells and LPS tolerance cells when an equal amount of VDR was used as a control (pull-down by VDR), but significantly decreased by AS treatment (Figure 6a1 ). However, AS had no effect on the nucleus protein of the associated NF-\u03baB p65 in each treatment when an equal amount of VDR was used as a control (pull-down by VDR) (Figure 6a2 ). These results suggested that AS might bind VDR to interrupt the interaction between VDR and NF-\u03baB p65 in cytoplasm, further implied that AS might affect the activity of NF-\u03baB p65.",

The results revealed an obvious co-localization of VDR and NF-\u03baB p65 in LPS tolerance cells, but AS significantly inhibited their co-localization (Figure 6b1, b2) . Moreover, nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p65 markedly declined in LPS tolerance cells relative to LPS cells, which was reversed by AS treatment (Figure 61, b3) . These results indicated that high level of VDR intensively interacted with NF-\u03baB p65, preventing the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p65. Noteworthily, AS inhibited the physical interaction between VDR and NF-\u03baB p65, accelerating the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p65. To confirm it, the nuclear protein level of NF-\u03baB p65 was investigated using ELISA and immunoblotting. The results showed NF-\u03baB p65 level in nucleus obviously reduced in LPS tolerance cells relative to LPS cells, which was reversed by AS (Figure 6c1, c2) . In LPS tolerance cells, the nuclear NF-\u03baB p65 level increased in VDR-KD group compared with negative control, leading to the loss of tolerance phenotype ( Figure 6d1 ). In VDR-OE cells, the NF-\u03baB p65 nucleoprotein level remarkably suppressed compared to negative control, and AS treatment made no difference in LPS tolerance cells ( Figure 6d2 ). To determine whether AS-promoting pro-inflammatory cytokines releases in LPS tolerance cells is related to its influence on NF-\u03baB p65 activity, NF-\u03baB p65 expression in RAW264.7 was modified ( Figure S4a, b) . The results showed that knock-down of NF-\u03baB p65 would lead to the decline in pro-inflammatory cytokines release, and loss of AS's effect ( Figure 6e1) . Simultaneously, overexpression of NF-\u03baB p65 would lead to loss of LPS tolerance phenotype, and addition of AS making no difference (Figure 6e2 ).

In VDR-KD CLP mice which VDR expression was knocked down using a lentiviral vector harboring a VDR RNAi sequence (VDR-KD) ( Figure S5a, b) , the level of TNF-\u03b1 in spleen and lungs was significantly increased compare with negative control, and AS administration made no difference (Figure 7b ). It suggested that VDR overexpression is involved in sepsis-induced immunosuppression formulation, and knocking down of VDR would lead to loss of immunosuppressing phenotype. Additionally, immunoblotting results showed that autophagy-associated proteins in the spleen of CLP mice were increased compare with negative control, and AS made no difference (Figure 7c ).

Considering the extensive biological effects of Vitamin D, as well as its role in maintenance of homeostasis in organisms, it is necessary to maintain the physiological concentration of Vitamin D. Based on our results, we consider that low level of Vitamin D might lead to the insufficiency of anti-inflammation response in human body, but excessive Vitamin D might induce the high level of VDR expression; however, the excessive overexpression of VDR might lead to a decreased immune function. Thus, Vitamin D supplementation is necessary in the diet but excessive intake of Vitamin D might be no benefit. Therefore, we consider that an ideal immunotherapy for sepsis is not only to exert an anti-inflammatory effect during the cytokine storm stage, but also increase the resistance to infection during the immunosuppression stage. The therapeutic effects of AS on cytokine storm stage of sepsis and its mechanism has been proved in our previous studies (Kuang et al., 2018; Li et al., 2010; Li et al., 2008) . Herein, we revealed that AS possessed therapeutic effects in sepsis-induced immunosuppression in vivo and in vitro, too.",

Furthermore, the interaction between AS and VDR was confirmed in the binding assay established in our lab. These results demonstrated that AS might interact with VDR to affect its activation, leading to a decline of VDR nuclear translocation. Thus, the effects of AS were investigated in presence and in absence of V D3 , which is the natural ligand of VDR. Our results showed AS's effect was eliminated when pro-incubated with V D3 , indicating that there is antagonism between V D3 and AS. These results strikingly suggest that AS might bind to the same receptor or even similar sites as V D3 .",

Herein, we focused on its function in sepsis immunosuppression stage, and discovered that NF-\u03baB p65 was negatively regulated by VDR due to the physical interaction between them in macrophages. Importantly, AS prevented the interaction between VDR and NF-\u03baB p65 in LPS-tolerance cells, leading to a marked increase in nuclear NF-\u03baB p65 translocation and expressions of downstream target genes such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. Furthermore, we found that AS decreased the binding between VDR and the promoter region of ATG16L1, leading to a decline in nuclear translocation of VDR and decreasing the negative transcription of ATG16L1, and lastly AS enhanced autophagy activities through binding VDR. Furthermore, knocking down VDR expression reversed the autophagy related proteins levels in immunosuppression stage, and over expressing VDR resulting in a failure of AS-promoting the autophagy related proteins levels. Thus, we concluded that AS interacted with VDR to reverse immunosuppression stage was autophagy involved. Taken together, we think AS interacted with VDR thereby inhibited the nuclear translocation of VDR and also inhibited physical interaction between VDR and NF-\u03baB p65 in LPS tolerance macrophages, then promoted nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p65, enhancing autophagy and activating the transcription of NF-\u03baB p65 target genes such as pro-inflammatory cytokines.",

However, given the therapeutic effect of AS on CLP animal models, we firmly believe that AS will improve the function of T and B cells. VDR is an interaction molecule of AS, whether VDR is a drug target of AS remains to be further studied in the future. Overall, our findings provide an evidence that AS interacted with VDR to reverse sepsis-induced immunosuppression in an autophagy and NF-\u03baB dependent way, highlighting a novel approach for sepsis treatment and drug repurposing of AS in the future.",
