The current state of the epidemic is increasingly serious, and there has been the urgent necessity to develop an effective new drug. In previous studies, it was found that the conformation change in CTD1 was the region where SARS-CoV bound to human ACE2. Although there are mutations of the 2019-nCoV, the binding energy of ACE2 remains high. The surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV was coincident with the CTD1 region of the S-protein by comparing the I-TASSER prediction model with the actual SARS model, which suggests that 2019-nCoV may bind to the ACE2 receptor through conformational changes. Furthermore, site prediction on the surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV suggests some core amino acid area may be a novel drug target against 2019-nCoV.",

In past studies, it was found that 28N can strongly bind PvdQ, and the residues near its binding site are T166, L169 and L170 12 . In the spatial structure simulation of S protein of 2019-ncov, we found that S protein has a three-dimensional structure highly cosimilar to PvdQ. More importantly, its binding site residues are also T874, L877 and L878, which are almost exactly matched. This conclusion indicates that 28N can bind to S protein. A search on the pubchem platform revealed that seven of the eight BioAssay Results listed as active were as inhibitors and one as stimulants. We speculate that 28N can inhibit the activity of S protein of 2019-ncov, but more experiments are needed to confirm this conclusion.",

A switch with more than one \"up\" CTD1 conformation will result in cleavage of the S1-ACE2 complex. Therefore, the research on new pneumonia drugs can also start from how to make spike trimer to turn on the upward switch. Antibodies against ACE2 or any compound that can bind to ACE2 are expected to be used in 2019-nCoV therapy, and the recognition of receptor binding sites will also contribute to the development of 2019-nCoV vaccine.",

In the functional prediction of protein, 28N or its molecules with similar structuresmay be used as a potential drug target to hydrolyze 2019-nCoV. Hopefully this study can help to develop new drug for the therapy of 2019-nCoV. Fig.1 Evolutionary relationships. The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method 14 The optimal tree with the sum of branch length = 0.00123858 is shown. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. The analysis involved 33 nucleotide sequences. Codon positions included were 1st+2nd+3rd+Noncoding. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 29874 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA7 15 The diagram shows the superposition of glycoprotein structure and 5x58 structure on the surface of the predicted 2019-nCoV, which ranked first. B. The diagram shows the overlap between the surface glycoprotein structure and the 5x58 structure of the predicted 2019-nCoV, which ranks second. C. The part circled in red represents ace2 and spike trimer in 5x58. d. Put 5x58 and the prediction model in the same coordinate system, zoom in on the CTD1 binding region, and the arrow represents the direction of the protein conformation.",
