            "text": "Background: Respiratory viral infections can cause significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. Conventional tests routinely available at most institutions are limited by the number of detectable pathogens, by a poor sensitivity and/or a long turnaround time. Objectives: To compare the performance of routine conventional testing with direct fluorescent antibody assays and viral culture to a customized TaqMan\u00ae array card (TAC) real-time PCR method, targeting 24 viruses, 8 bacteria and 2 fungi simultaneously. Study design: We collected 143 respiratory samples from 120 symptomatic immunocompromised patients. Samples for which conventional and TAC results were discordant underwent further verification testing. Results: The TAC assay identified viral pathogens in more samples than did conventional testing (77/143 versus 27/143; McNemar P < 0.0001), even when TAC results for viruses that could not be detected by conventional testing were excluded from analysis (59/143 versus 26/143; P < 0.0001). In addition, the TAC assay identified 18 samples with non-viral pathogens. Verification testing confirmed positive TAC results for 50 out of 55 samples for which conventional testing was negative. Two out of three samples with a positive conventional test but negative TAC result were confirmed positive. A viral and a total pathogen co-infection rate of 5.6% and 11.8% were found, respectively. Conclusions: The customized TAC assay resulted in a significantly increased identification of respiratory viruses. This study provides a practical real-life assessment of the performance of the TAC assay in a population for whom rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral and atypical pathogens is crucial for appropriate clinical management.",

Viruses usually associated with self-limited upper respiratory tract illness in immunocompetent hosts, can evoke lower respiratory tract infections leading to bronchiolitis, pneumonitis/pneumonia or acute for the clinical laboratory. Many commercial as well as in-house developed assays exist nowadays which offer a syndromic based approach for the detection of respiratory pathogens. This study focusses on the TaqMan\u00ae Array Card (TAC) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), a microfluidic technology based on singleplex, reverse transcription real-time PCR in a 384well microfluidic card. These cards are already commercialized for multiple gene expression and micro-RNA expression analyses and have been extensively used in cancer research [7] [8] [9] . For infectious diseases diagnostics, only in-house developed custom-made TAC assays exist to date [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] .",

The TAC assay identified 77 samples with one or more viral respiratory pathogens (53.8%). Detailed results are shown in Fig. 2 Table 3 . Almost one fifth of all included samples were positive for IA virus. The positivity rate was higher for NTS samples (63.9%) than for BAL samples (45.7%), but the difference was not statistically significant. For NTS samples only, the viral distribution at genus level was as follows: IA (27.8%), CMV (8.3%), rhinovirus (6.5%), RSV and coronavirus (5.5%) the most frequently encountered, followed by IB and hMPV (3.7%). Adenovirus and parainfluenza viruses were detected in only a limited number of samples (\u22643.0%). For BAL samples, less IA (14.3%), RSV and coronavirus (2.8%) were found but more CMV (11.4%), rhinovirus (8.6%) and IB (5.7%). Human MPV, adenovirus and PIV were not detected in BAL samples. In addition to the viral pathogens, the TAC assay identified 13 samples with P. jirovecii, 2 samples with Aspergillus species and 1 sample each with B. parapertussis, M. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila. When viral and non-viral pathogens were considered, more than one pathogen was detected in 17 samples (11.9%). Table 4 shows the combinations of these pathogens and Ct-values identified by TAC.

The importance of the specimen type is highlighted in several studies. In BAL specimens a diagnostic yield ranging from 3.6% to 32.0% was reported [15] [16] [17] .

The exact clinical interpretation of these multi-pathogen screening results is not always easy.

To note, the card used in this study did not include herpesviruses (HSV-1/2, VZV, HHV-6) besides CMV, which could be of possible interest for an immunocompromised patient population [23] . Another advantage is the spatial separation of the 48 reaction wells which allows assays to be easily changed without the need for extensive reoptimisation and validation of a highly parallel multiplex assay. This could aid in the rapid inclusion of novel or emerging pathogens [14] . In addition, the technology uses real-time PCR which generates a semi-quantitative Ct-value, in contrast to many commercial multi-pathogen assays which only offer qualitative results. This tool is decisive for an adequate and correct interpretation of results, particularly in case of co-infections. Moreover, the workflow is simple and easy and the cost per test is relatively low in comparison to most commercial multi-pathogen molecular assays.",
