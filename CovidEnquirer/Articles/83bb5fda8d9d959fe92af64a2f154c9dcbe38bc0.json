The early and routine implementation of this testing is testament to its prognostic importance for humans. Although a plethora of assay chemistries and methods exist for 96-well formats, few are practical and sufficiently sensitive enough for application in high throughput screening (HTS). Here we briefly describe a handful of the currently most robust and validated HTS assays for accurate and efficient assessment of cytotoxic risk. We also provide guidance for successful HTS implementation and discuss unique merits and detractions inherent in each method. Lastly, we discuss the advantages of combining specific HTS compatible assays into multi-parametric, same-well formats.",

These activities are typically metabolic biomarkers such as ATP and mitochondrial reductase potential, but can include homeostatic \"housekeeping\" enzyme activities. The underlying assay premise is that these activities are directly proportional to viable cell number after a treatment period. During relatively short incubation periods (8 hr or less), a reduction or complete cessation of these biomarker activities is strongly indicative of overt cytotoxicity by catastrophic membrane damage (i.e. primary necrosis) [11] . A reduction in biomarker activity compared to control in longer incubations indicates either a reduction in normal cellular division rate (cell-cycle arrest) or cell death by programmed elimination mechanisms such as apoptosis [12, 13] . Because viability assays measure the relative number of cells remaining after treatment, they offer significant utility even during long compound-contact periods (72 hr).",

The assays also benefit from relatively high signal to background ratios, which enable routine miniaturization into 1536 well formats [36, 37] . Furthermore, luminescence signals are not encumbered by intrinsically fluorescent test compounds [38] . Despite an abundance of advantages for HTS implementation, ATP assays also carry liabilities. Because the ATPdependent luciferase reaction rate is susceptible to temperature flux, equilibration to constant room temperature is required to minimize thermal gradients created by plate well position (edge-effects). Also, like other metabolic assay chemistries used to measure viability, ATP is (rarely) subject to positive or negative modulation by test reagents independent of loss of viability leading to misleading data [39, 40] . Lastly, all commercial formulations of ATP-detection chemistries are susceptible to luciferase inhibition to various degrees by small molecule compounds. Recent evidence suggests that specific formulations may greatly minimize the extent of this inhibition [41] .",

Unlike viability assays whereby a decline in cell response is strongly inferred to be caused by cell-cycle arrest or death, detection of cytotoxic biomarker activities outside the cellular compartment after treatment is proof-positive for a compound's cytotoxic effect. Unfortunately, activity-based surrogates of cell death have a finite enzymatic half-life, which can limit their utility during long compound/cell contact incubations (48-72 hr) [3, 27] . Enzymatic decay as a function of time in culture medium can lead to underestimation of the absolute level of cytotoxicity [27] .

First, it is possible to conduct immediate confirmation testing of apparent cytotoxic compounds in the same well by leveraging the statistical power of orthogonal detection of viability (viable cell aminopeptidase, dead cell protease and ATP biomarkers). The economy of this consolidated testing is noteworthy in terms of compound usage, culture set up, and operator man-hours. Second, the mechanism of cell death can often be elucidated when combined with caspase detection reagents, allowing for partial characterization of a compound's potential. It should be noted however, that caspase activity can be transient and immeasurable in long-term experiments due to the kinetics of apoptosis and caspase biomarker decay. Therefore, caspase-negative data sets should be rescreened at multiple compound exposure periods. This type of characterization of pathway dependent cytotoxicity is useful for continued annotation of a library, because compounds causing necrotic profiles at micromolar concentrations are rarely therapeutically useful and may offer unacceptable cytotoxic risk. And third, viability and cytotoxicity can be used to normalize luminescent data from other assays (Fig. 7) . Single parameter genetic reporter responses are susceptible to experimental variation due to differential transfection efficiencies, cell number delivered to the well (clumping) or to cytotoxicity caused by the test compound [55] . Viability and cytotox-icity data can therefore help reconcile aberrant data points or explain decreases in genetic reporter signals due to cell death.",

The use of disparate detection platform methodologies is known to greatly reduce the statistical potential for assay interferences associated with reporter molecules [60] . Therefore this combination of chemistries is favored if a library is uncharacterized with regard to the relative abundance of luminogenic inhibitors or which may cause fluorescence interference. Unlike the fluorescence/fluorescence multiplex, fewer convenient triplex options exist. For example, the chemistry can be configured with a fluorogenic caspase activation chemistry (R110 fluorophore) to deliver data relating to possible induction of apoptosis (Fig. 7A) [61, 62] . Again, negative caspase induction results should be verified by rescreening to verify necrotic response profiles.",

Another remarkable feature of luminogenic assays is the persistent and stable glow-type signal produced after reagent addition (Fig. 8) . This attribute can be harnessed to produce both viability and cytotoxicity values from the same well. In this method, the non-lytic, luminogenic cytotoxicity assay chemistry is first delivered to the assay well and cytotoxicity measured. Next, a lytic agent is added to assay wells to artificially release the remaining dead cell protease from viable cells. The net signal derived after complete lysis reflects the contribution of all the cells in the assay well. Because the luminescent signal is additive and proportional, the viable cell population can be indirectly determined by subtracting the cytotoxic values from the total values. This method is particularly useful for determining cytotoxicity in long incubation protocols where dead cell biomarker activity may not fully reflect actual cytotoxicity. One caveat of this method is that both viability and cytotoxicity measurements utilize the same biomarker and are subject to the same interferences.",
