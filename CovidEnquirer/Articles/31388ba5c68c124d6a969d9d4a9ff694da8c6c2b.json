A secondary bacterial chest infection was suspected, and cefipime 2 g was given intravenously.

The patient was given a single dose of methylprednisolone 500 mg intravenously and 4 L/min of oxygen. After this, he began to get better. Coagulation parameters returned to normal, he was weaned off of oxygen, and was discharged from hospital on March 31, 2003, on 0\u00b73 mg/kg prednisolone and ribavirin 600 mg orally three times a day. On April 7, his chest radiograph showed worsening consolidation of the consolidation of the right middle zone and the prednisolone was increased to 0\u00b75 mg/kg. This illness shows several characteristic features of SARS. There is often a break in the fever between the viraemic stage (days 1-3) and the lung inflammation phase of the illness.

These vaccines have been associated with reduced immunogenicity of the Hib component, although there is little agreement on the clinical relevance of this finding. We retrospectively compared vaccine formulations given to fully vaccinated Hib cases with those administered to fully immunised age-matched controls using conditional logistic regression. More cases than controls received all three doses of their infant primary course as DTaP-Hib, compared with two or three doses of another Hib vaccine (conditional odds ratio 6\u00b777 [95% CI 3\u00b726-14\u00b707]).",

Despite a striking initial fall in the rate of disease in England and Wales from 22\u00b79 per 100 000 children younger than 5 years in 1990, the incidence of invasive Hib infection has risen from the nadir of 0\u00b765 per 100 000 in 1998 to 4\u00b76 per 100 000 in 2002. From these data, the estimated direct protective effect of Hib vaccine against invasive disease in the first 2 years of life was substantially lower in children born in 2000 and 2001 than in those born between August, 1992 and December, 1999. 1 ",
