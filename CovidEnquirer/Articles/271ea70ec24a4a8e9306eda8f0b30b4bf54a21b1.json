Infection control programs in veterinary hospitals have largely evolved from evidence and protocols from the human health care setting, together with our understanding of transmission pathways for veterinary pathogens. In recent years, several factors have led to an increased rate of adoption of infection control programs by veterinary hospitals, such as an increased prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections among small animal patients, the appearance of more studies that support the common occurrence of transmission of hospital-associated and zoonotic pathogens in the veterinary setting, the requirement for an infection control program in veterinary teaching hospitals for accreditation purposes, and increased scrutiny of hospital-associated and zoonotic infections to protect hospitals against litigation. be regularly updated by a designated hospital infection control officer or committee. Each hospital should develop a protocol that is tailored to address specific practice requirements and the hospital design, purpose, and equipment used. Additional special precautions may need to be described for hospitals that see avian and exotic pet animal species, and in geographic locations where serious zoonotic diseases such as rabies and plague are endemic (see Chapters 13 and 55) .",

Online videos that demonstrate proper hand-washing technique are available for educational purposes. 2 Guidelines for hand washing are shown in Box 11-1. Antibacterial soap should be used, and all surfaces of the hands should be rubbed together, which should include the backs of the hands, between the fingers, and under the fingernails, for a total handwashing time of at least 20 seconds. In order to prevent chapped skin, which can harbor bacteria, water used for hand washing should not be too hot, and hand lotion should be applied regularly. Behaviors such as keeping fingernails short, avoidance of artificial and/or polished fingernails or hand jewelry, or wearing jewelry on a chain around the neck instead of on the hand can be encouraged. Meticulous hand hygiene is particularly important for personnel who work frequently with immunocompromised animals, such as emergency and critical care personnel.

Transmission by droplet nuclei occurs with diseases such as measles, varicella, and pulmonary tuberculosis. The precautions for human patients involve isolation in a single-bed, negative-pressure room and the wearing of high-density respirator (N95) masks. These resemble surgical masks but filter 1-\u00b5m particles with an efficiency of at least 95% and must be properly fitted. Airborne contact precautions are rarely necessary in hospitals that treat only dogs and cats, but could be considered when animals suspected to have pneumonic plague, tularemia, or Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Droplet precautions are used to prevent transmission by large-particle aerosols and do not require a negative-pressure room. Droplet precautions apply to dogs and cats with transmissible respiratory disease. Contact precautions are indicated for animals with infections that can be transmitted by direct contact with the patient or through fomite contact.",

This is the most effective form of sterilization, is nontoxic and inexpensive, and as a result is the most widely used as well. The use of steam under pressure allows lower temperatures to be used for shorter periods of time when compared with dry heat sterilization (Table 11 -4). The most common temperatures used for steam sterilization are 121\u00b0C (250\u00b0F) and 132\u00b0C (270\u00b0F). Cycle times vary depending on the autoclave used and whether items are wrapped or unwrapped, but are generally less than 30 minutes (see Table  11 -4). There are two basic types of autoclaves: gravity displacement autoclaves, and high-speed prevacuum sterilizers. Gravity displacement autoclaves admit steam at the top or sides of the autoclave, which displaces air through a drain vent at the bottom of the chamber (Figure 11-1) . High-speed prevacuum sterilizers rapidly pump air out of the sterilizer before steam is admitted. This leads to rapid penetration of steam into all surfaces. As a result, cycle times can be reduced to less than 15 minutes. Drying times are also reduced with prevacuum sterilizers. Sterilizers should be located away from potential sources of contamination, such as sinks, trash disposal, or high-traffic areas. Before steam sterilization is performed, instruments should be cleaned thoroughly to remove organic and inorganic material, and then dried. All jointed items should be opened or unlocked, and items should not be crowded in the autoclave, so that steam can circulate freely. At least 3 inches should be left between the autoclave wall and items to be sterilized. The manufacturer's instructions for autoclave operation should be followed.",

Contact times of at least 20 minutes (at or above 20\u00b0C) are effective for high-level disinfection. Sterilization requires a 10-hour contact time and higher concentrations of glutaraldehyde (e.g., Cidex Plus, which contains 3.4% glutaraldehyde), or formulations that combine glutaraldehyde with another disinfectant. Once activated, 2.4% glutaraldehyde solution retains activity for 14 days, provided inadvertent dilution does not occur. The solution is active in the presence of 2% organic matter. Inadvertent dilution can occur when endoscopes that contain fluid within their channels are immersed in the solution. Test strips are available from the manufacturer to monitor the activity of the solution, but should not be used to extend the solution's expiration date.

Like iodophors, chlorhexidine has limited activity against fungi and mycobacteria. A 2% chlorhexidine solution is preferred over 70% alcohol or povidone-iodine for skin preparation of central venous catheter sites in human patients 18 and is the skin antiseptic of choice for collection of blood for blood cultures.

To facilitate passive surveillance, clinicians should be encouraged to use appropriate diagnostic testing to determine the etiology of nosocomial infections, even if the clinical consequences are not severe. They also should be encouraged to confirm a diagnosis in animals with suspected transmissible disease.

Although syndromes do not indicate a specific disease, they can indicate an increased risk of infectious disease. Syndromic surveillance is an initial screening tool that can be used by all personnel, including lay personnel, to flag potentially high-risk cases and allow for early implementation of enhanced infection control practices. All clinic personnel should be made aware of certain syndromes that indicate the need either for isolation or for further investigation, such as diarrhea, fever of unknown origin, acute neurologic disease, wound infections, and acute respiratory tract disease. Protocols to deal with these animals on arrival should be developed. As an example, a dog with an acute onset of cough should be considered potentially infectious, and if front office personnel note this syndrome at the time the appointment is made, the dog can be handled appropriately on arrival (e.g., admitted directly to isolation or an examination room, with personnel wearing enhanced barrier precautions from the onset). The role of lay staff (i.e., front office stall) is critical, as these people are the ones who are most able to identify such cases before they enter the clinic and ensure that they are properly handled to prevent nosocomial or zoonotic transmission.",

Careful preparation of the patient, therefore, can help reduce contamination of the surgical site during surgery. The goal of preoperative surgical site management is to eliminate potential pathogens while not creating a physical environment that is more conducive to bacterial colonization or infection postoperatively. Bathing of the patient preoperatively is reasonable if there is significant contamination of the haircoat 19 and if the patient's coat can be dried by the time of surgery. In most situations, bathing is not required. Rather, careful hair removal and skin antisepsis are the main measures. The goals of surgical scrubbing of patients are to reduce bacterial counts, reduce debris, and facilitate later antisepsis. Scrubbing should be done as atraumatically as possible. Minimizing skin damage during clipping and scrubbing is essential, because skin damage from excessive attempts to clip all remaining pieces of hair or from forceful scrubbing of the surgical site can create an environment that is more amenable to bacterial growth. This predisposes to infection rather than reducing the risk. Clipping should be performed after anesthesia, to reduce the risk of trauma associated with a struggling patient and to minimize the time between clipping and surgery. Clipping should be done outside the operating environment. There is currently no information that relates to optimal methods of cleaning and disinfecting clippers. Repeated use of clipper blades without sterilization not surprisingly results in higher levels of bacterial contamination of blades 20 ; however, the clinical relevance of this is unclear, because the surgical site is cleaned and disinfected after clipping. Regular cleaning and disinfection of clippers are probably useful, and they should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected after use on an animal with a potentially transmissible infection (e.g., an animal with diarrhea), on an area where the skin is broken, or on any area where the skin or hair is significantly contaminated with feces, urine, blood, or other body fluids.",

Compartmentalized housing allows animals to urinate and defecate away from areas where they rest and eat, and provision of a hiding area so that animals can retreat from visual stimulation can also reduce stress. A total of 10 to 20 air changes per hour is often recommended for animal housing, but higher levels of ventilation may be needed with increased population density and concentration of airborne contaminants.
