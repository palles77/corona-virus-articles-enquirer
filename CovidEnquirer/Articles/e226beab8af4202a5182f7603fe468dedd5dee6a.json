B#24 was diluted to 100 \u00b5M and UV 550 absorbance readings recorded using a BioTek synergy plate reader from 200 -400 nm. 10 \u00b5L 551 additions of a 500 mM Mg 2+ solution containing 100 \u00b5M B#24 (to keep compound concentration 552 consistent) was added stepwise followed by absorbance readings between each addition. The 553 concentration of Mg 2+ was raised with each addition from 0.5 mM to 120 mM. Alignment, 554 reference subtraction of blanks, and plotting were done on raw data using Microsoft Excel. 555",

Preliminary experiments established the concentration of luciferin to be used in the 561 assay in order to closely mimic the protein signal in single-round infectivity assay and give 562 maximal sensitivity in luminescence readings.
