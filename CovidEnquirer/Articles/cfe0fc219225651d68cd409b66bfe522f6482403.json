A limitation of this study was the unavailability of data for native-born and foreign-born persons by sex and age to compare ageand sex-specifi c TB case rates between these 2 groups. In addition, because of the lack of population data for country of birth, we were unable to determine the TB rate by country of origin. Also, information bias is inherent in retrospective studies, and most country of birth data were based on information submitted by the notifying physician. We were also unable to analyze the association of HIV and TB because access to HIV status in our study population was limited.

We estimated the number of persons born in Singapore during 2000-2010 by using linear interpolation based on 2000 and 2010 population census exercises. Consistent with the country classifi cation used in the Singapore 2000 population census, People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan were classifi ed as 1 group of country of birth. There were 23,164 cases of TB (new and re-treated) reported to the registry during 2000-2009. After we excluded 4,033 short-term pass holders, persons whose TB diagnosis had changed (n = 97), and persons with missing information about country of origin (n = 34), a total of 19,000 persons were eligible for the study. Of these persons, 13,048 (68.7%) were born in Singapore and 5,952 (31.3%) were foreign born. The number and proportion of foreignborn cases decreased in the fi rst half of the study period from 675 (33.6%) in 2000 to 444 (25.5%) in 2004. This trend reversed during 2005, and the number and proportion of foreign-born persons with TB increased to 788 (37.6%) in 2009 (Figure 1). Of foreign-born persons with TB, 3,386 (56.9%) were LTPHs, 1,820 (30.6%) were PRs, and 746 (12.5%) were naturalized citizens. LTPHs with TB comprised 2,562 (75.7%) unskilled workers, 371 (10.9%) professional and skilled workers, and 162 (4.8%) students. The remaining 291(8.6%) persons were foreign-born family members of Singapore citizens or PRs who were granted long-term stay in Singapore. TB among LTPHs increased from 220 (49.5%) cases in 2004 to 532 (67.5%) in 2009 and that among PRs increased from 45 (6.7%) in 2000 to 124 (15.7%); cases among foreignborn citizens decreased from 342 (50.7%) in 2000 to 132 (16.8%) in 2009 (Figure 2, panel A). The number of persons with TB from Indonesia, the Philippines, and Myanmar increased from 2000-2004 to 2005-2009 (",
