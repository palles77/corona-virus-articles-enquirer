This fact could perhaps be part of the explanation about the behavior of this novel coronavirus concerning human infection. Preliminary genome sequencing suggested the snake as a likely wildlife reservoir responsible for the current outbreak of 2019-nCoV infection and origin-unknown homologous recombination identified within the spike glycoprotein of the 2019-nCoV may explain snake-to-human cross-species transmission [2] . However, this theory has now been largely discounted and some researchers point towards bats as a reservoir and doubt that the coronavirus could have originated in animals other than birds or mammals [2] ; they are skeptical that the animal host or hosts of 2019-nCoV can be identified without further field and laboratory research. Many hope that genetic tests of animals or environmental sources, such as cages and containers, from the Wuhan market will reveal clues [17] regarding the definite origin of the virus. The outbreak of viral pneumonia in Wuhan is associated with exposures at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, suggesting a possible zoonosis.",

WHO reported an increase in the number of confirmed and suspected cases and affected provinces.

Of the confirmed cases, 25% are reported to be severe and underlying comorbidities were detected in many of them and elderly. The Chinese government declared the death of the first health professional who provided assistance at Wuhan hospital. Remarkably, WHO has reported that in the last one week, less than 15% of new cases reported had visited the Huanan market. Health care workers have also been infected. Fourth-generation cases in Wuhan and second-generation cases outside Wuhan, as well as some clusters outside Hubei province, could be traced back [21] .

An estimate of R 0 of 1.4-2.5 was presented [23] . Other estimates, however, yield higher R 0 figures. As researchers are saying, sustained human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV is one of the most important topics issues that could explain the scale of the Wuhan outbreak. Considering this, it is not only important to follow the progression of the epidemic closely but to also coordinate the countries' mechanisms to mitigate the impact in health care services and the community [23] . There are no known useful treatments for the disease caused by this new coronavirus; therefore, contact and respiratory precautions are the only effective measures to prevent this emerging coronavirus [23] .",

Moreover, both outbreaks were initially connected to \"wet markets\" where game animals and meat were sold [19] . In the case of SARS, the person-to-person transmission was efficient and super-spreading events led to significant outbreaks in hotels and hospitals. Learning from the SARS outbreak, which started as animal-tohuman transmission during the first phase of the epidemic, all game meat trades should be optimally regulated to terminate this portal of transmission [19] . Emerging and reemerging pathogens are global challenges for public health and a matter for concerns in travelers from all over the world.
