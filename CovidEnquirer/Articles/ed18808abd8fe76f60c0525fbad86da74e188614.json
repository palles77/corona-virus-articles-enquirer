The present study examines a simplified procedure for delivering antigen to rabbit Peyer's patches via an indwelling cannula. The cannula was placed 3-4 cm proximal to the Peyer's patch, and was used to deliver four weekly doses of the potent mucosal immunogen, cholera toxin (CT). Anti-CT specific fecal secretory IgA (S-IgA), serum IgG and serum IgA were found in essentially equal amounts in rabbits with cannulas and in rabbits fitted with Thiry-Vella (T-V) isolated ileal loops. In contrast to animals with T-V loops, the intestinal flora of animals with cannulas contained less bacteria1 overgrowth with Pseudomonas sp. Further, the villus architecture remained histologically normal in appearance and there were fewer post-surgical complications associated with this technique than with T-V loops. This simplified technique should allow wider use of rabbits in studies of mucosal immunity.",

A multitude of vaccine candidates have been tested for the ability to elicit mucosal immunity to pathogenic organisms and their toxins. However, only a limited number of well characterized animal models are available for such studies, with most employing inbred mice.

The exceedingly slow gastric motility of the rabbit can compromise the stability of orally administered protein antigens, making direct injection of vaccine preparations to the intestinal mucosa more desirable.",

This model has proven valuable as both a direct route for mucosal immunization as well as an access port for collecting intestinal secretions after local stimulation. There are several inherent shortcomings to surgical isolation of the intestine which reduce the utility of the T-V loop model. Chief among these are morphological changes in the villus epithelium resulting from isolation of the loop from thyme (Keren et al., 1975) , and chronic mucosal inflammation due to bacterial overgrowth in the loops (Keren et al., 1980a ,Kem et al.. 1987 .

Continuity of the intestine was restored by end-to-end anastamosis using con- tinuous 4-O silk sutures. Two tubes (Silastic type, Dow Coming, Midland, MI) were sewn into the ends of the isolated segment using a purse string suture of 4-O silk (Deknatel, Queens Village.

Several anatomical and physiological features of the rabbit intestine offer advantages over rodent models. First, the rabbit intestine contains numerous, easily distinguishable Peyer's patches, each of which contains a large numbers of lymphocytes. Secondly, the majority of S-IgA secreted into the rabbit intestine is locally produced by resident plasma cells in the lamina propria. This parallels human intestinal immunity, as the majority of serum IgA in both species is in monomeric form. Rodents have substantially more dimeric IgA in serum, which is efficiently transported via the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) expressed on epithelial cells lining liver sinusoids. Once bound to pIgR. the complex is transcytosed to the bile as S-IgA. and ultimately secreted into the intestinal lumen. Finally, direct administration of antigen to the intestine allows a more precise estimate of the dose delivered, and affords a higher degree of confidence regarding antigen stability. Studies in rodents rely on the administration of antigen to the stomach, in large volumes of bicarbonate buffer, via orogastric feeding needles. The transit time to the intestine, degree of acidification, and percentage of intact antigen which reaches the intestinal inductive sites is generally unknown.",

Nonetheless. both groups of animal elicited high titer serum IgG anti-CT responses (> 30000). The anti-CT serum IgA and fecal S-IgA responses were comparable in both groups of animals, indicating that both techniques were capable of stimulating B and T cells of the patch to mature, proliferate, traffic, and ultimately populate the effector tissues of the gut (viz. the lamina propria). For the purposes of comparison, only the most distal ileal Peyer's patches were used in both groups of animals.
