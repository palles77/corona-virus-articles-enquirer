Following AHV-1 infection, DEF showed morphological changes such as cell rounding, improved refractivity and detachment from the culture surface. However, its pathological characteristics were not adequately known. Related studies were performed and the results showed that syncytium formation could be observed as the other type of CPE in AHV-1 infection. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and 4', 6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI) staining of infected DEF were each used to visualize the shape and distribution of chromatin within nuclei and nuclear fragmentation was observed. Chromatin condensation and margination, as well as formation of apoptotic bodies were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). DNA ladder formation was detected in AHV-1 infected cells and apoptosis of the infected DEF was also detected by flow cytometry analysis of Annexin V-FITC/PI staining method. Therefore, it was suggested that AHV-1 virulent strain can induce syncytium and apoptosis in DEF. Syncytium formation and apoptosis observed in this study may contribute to the elucidation of AHV-1 pathogenesis.",

Apoptosis as an energy-dependent process of cell suicide without provoking an inflammatory response (Vaux and Strasser, 1996) can be triggered by diverse intracellular and extracellular signals including virus infections. An increasing number of viruses or viral gene products have been reported to induce apoptosis (Groux et al., 1992; Ito et al., 1997; Ruggieri et al., 2007; Sanfilippo et al., 2004; Lovato et al., 2003; Sadzot-Delvaux et al., 1995; Aleman et al., 2001; Yuan et al., 2007) both in vitro and in vivo, which includes herpesvirus and is one of the cytolytic properties of viral infections and the phenotype of CPE in vitro.",

Since apoptosis plays an important role (Yuan et al., 2007) in the pathogenesis of AHV-1 infection in vivo, in this paper proper modifications were made based on the preliminary findings (Guo et al., 2007) and further steps were taken as well to investigate the AHV-1 induced apoptosis in vitro, which we believe will help clarify the pathological characteristics of AHV-1.",

Infection of chick kidney cell monolayers with avian paramyxoviruses could lead to CPE consisting of small discrete syncytia (Shortridge et al., 1980) containing 2-6 nuclei which were formed by cell fusion and were visible from about 24 h onwards. In duckling kidney cell cultures infected by Muscovy duck reovirus, cytopathic changes in the form of large syncytia could be observed (Heffels-Redmann et al., 1992) . When monolayers of primary hamster kidney cell cultures were infected with herpesvirus from turkeys, foci consisting of rounded refractile cells and syncytia were observed (Hamdy et al., 1974) . In duck embryo fibroblast cultures infected by Marek's disease virus, well-developed, isolated microplaques were seen and these microplaques were composed of one or more syncytia (Nazerian and Purchase, 1970) in the center and many rounded and fusiform refractile cells in the periphery. All the polykarvocytes observed in this study were true multinucleate cells in which the cytoplasm was not divided by membranes partially separating the nuclei. From the cytological analysis and microscopic observation we can also know that the AHV-1 syncytia formation observed in this study was developed as result of ''fusion of neighboring cells''. Polykaryocyte formation appears to be a general feature in herpesvirus-type infections (Nazerian et al., 1971 ) and since herpes simplex virus type 1 glycoproteins gB, gD, and gHgL are necessary and sufficient to mediate membrane fusion in a Cos cell transfection system (Turner et al., 1998) , similar study could also be further undertaken to verify the related gene function of AHV-1.",
