Early studies showed monovalent formalin-20 inactivated HRV vaccine can be protective, and virus-neutralizing antibodies (nAb) correlated 21 with protection. However, co-circulation of many HRV types discouraged further vaccine 22 efforts. We approached this problem straightforwardly. We tested the hypothesis that increasing 23 virus input titers in polyvalent inactivated HRV vaccine will result in broad nAb responses. Here, 24 we show that serum nAb against many rhinovirus types can be induced by polyvalent, 25 inactivated HRVs plus alhydrogel (alum) adjuvant. Using formulations up to 25-valent in mice 26 and 50-valent in rhesus macaques, HRV vaccine immunogenicity was related to sufficient 27 quantity of input antigens, and valency was not a major factor for potency or breadth of the 28 response. We for the first time generated a vaccine capable of inducing nAb responses to 29 numerous and diverse HRV types.",

Sera from na\u00efve mice had no detectable nAb 71 against HRV-16 ( Fig. 1) . Alum adjuvant enhanced the nAb response induced by i.m. inactivated 72 HRV-16 ( Fig. 1) . There was no effect of valency (comparing 1-, 3-, 5-, 7-, and 10-valent) on the 73 nAb response induced by inactivated HRV-16 or to the 3 types in the 3-valent vaccine (HRV-16, 74 HRV-36, and HRV-78) (Fig. 1) . The 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) titers of the 75 input viruses prior to inactivation (inactivated-TCID 50 ) are provided in Supplemental Table 1 . 76 Original antigenic sin can occur when sequential exposure to related virus variants results in 77 biased immunity to the type encountered first 32 . In bivalent HRV-immune mice, we observed 78 modest original antigenic sin following prime vaccination with 10-valent inactivated HRV, and 79 boost vaccination partially alleviated the effect (Supplemental Fig. 1) , similar to influenza 80 virus 32 . Collectively, these results prompted us to explore more fully the nAb response to 81 polyvalent HRV vaccine.",

However, the 84 input titers of viruses prior to inactivation ranged from 10 1.5 to 10 5.5 TCID 50 per ml, and these 85 were then diluted 10-fold to generate 10-valent 1.0 ml doses given i.m. as prime and boost with 86 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/053967 doi: bioRxiv preprint no adjuvant 33 . We hypothesized that low input antigen doses are responsible for poor nAb 87 responses to 10-valent inactivated HRV. We reconstituted the 1975 10-valent vaccine, as closely 88 as possible with available HRV types, over a 10 1 to 10 5 inactivated-TCID 50 per vaccine dose, and 89 we compared it to a 10-valent vaccine of the same types with input titers ranging from > 10 5 to > 90 10 7 inactivated-TCID 50 per dose. The reconstituted 1975 vaccine resulted in no detectable nAb 91 after prime vaccination and, following boost vaccination, nAb to the five types that had the 92 highest input titers (Fig. 2) . The high titer vaccine resulted in nAb to 5 of 10 types after prime 93 vaccination and all 10 types after the boost (Fig. 2) . Following the boost vaccinations, there 94 appeared to be a 10 4 inactivated-TCID 50 per vaccine dose threshold for the induction of nAb in 95 this model (Fig. 2b) . Above this titer, there was no correlation between input load and nAb Table 2 ) to accommodate the volume adjustment. The 10-valent inactivated 102 HRV vaccine induced nAb to 100% of input types following the prime and the boost (Fig. 3a) . 103 The nAb induced by 10-valent inactivated HRV were persisting at 203 days post-boost 104 (Supplemental Fig. 2) . The 25-valent inactivated HRV prime vaccination induced nAb to 18 of 105 25 (72%) virus types, and the 25-valent boost resulted in nAb against 24 of the 25 types (96%) 106 (Fig 3b) . The average nAb titer resulting from prime + boost was 2 7 for 10-valent and 2 6.8 for 25-107 valent. The data demonstrate broad neutralization of diverse HRV types with a straightforward 108 vaccine approach.",

The Ab repertoire is theoretically immense, and most 49 vaccines in clinical use are thought to work via a polyclonal Ab response. Deep-sequencing of 50 human Ab genes following vaccination against influenza virus found thousands of Ab 51 lineages 18,19 . Whole pathogen and polyvalent vaccines carrying natural immunogens take 52 advantage of this capacity. Valency has increased for pneumococcal and human papillomavirus 53 virus vaccines in recent years. Given the significance of HRV, we tested polyvalent HRV 54 vaccines. 55 There are three species of HRV, A, B, and C. Sequencing methods define 83 A types, 32 56 B types, and 55 C types 20,21 .

All experiments involving animals were conducted at Emory 209 University and the Yerkes National Primate Research Center in accordance with guidelines 210 established by the Animal Welfare Act and the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory 211 Animals. Animal facilities at Emory University and the Yerkes Center are fully accredited by the 212 Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International 213 (AAALAC). The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Emory University 214 approved these studies. Pathogen-free, 6-7-week female BALB/c mice were purchased from the 215 Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA).
