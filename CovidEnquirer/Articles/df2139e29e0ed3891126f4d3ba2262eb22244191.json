An RNA probe containing this 11-nucleotide sequence bound four cellular proteins with a highly labeled protein of 120 kDa and three minor species with sizes of 103, 81, and 55 kDa. Mutation of the 11-nucleotide motif abolished cellular protein binding. The RNA-protein complexes observed with cytoplasmic extracts from MHV-JHM-infected cells in both RNase protection/gel mobility shift and UV cross-linking assays were indistinguishable from those observed with extracts from uninfected cells. Both negative-strand synthesis and positivestrand replication of viral defective interfering RNAs in the presence of helper virus were affected by mutations that disrupt RNA-protein complex formation, even though the 11 mutated nucleotides were converted to the wild-type sequence, presumably by recombination with helper virus. Kinetic analysis indicated that recombination between DI RNA and helper virus occurred relatively early in the MHV replicative cycle at 5.5 to 7.5 hr postinfection, a time when viral RNA synthesis and replication of positive-strand DI RNA were at barely detectable levels. A DI RNA with a mutation upstream of the protein binding element replicated as efficiently as wild type without undergoing recombination. Thus, the 11-nucleotide conserved host protein binding motif appears to play an important role in viral RNA replication. \u1b67",

The sequence at their 5 termini which is identical to the sequences from 56 to 436 upstream of the 3 terminus sequence of genomic RNA at the 5 end. Several models of the genome [excluding the poly(A) tail] are thought to of discontinuous transcription have been described to play a role in the synthesis of plus-stranded RNA, alexplain the mechanism of MHV RNA synthesis (Brian et though the mechanism by which this occurs is not clear. al., 1994; Lai, 1990; Sawicki and Our approach to studying MHV RNA replication is to Sawicki, 1990; Schaad and Baric, 1994; identify the cis-acting signals for RNA replication and the 1988). In all of these models, the initial step in MHV RNA proteins which recognize these signals at the 3 end of replication is the synthesis of negative-strand RNA from genomic RNA of MHV. We have focused our attention a positive-strand genomic template. Thus, transcription on the 3 end of MHV genome as it is likely that the 3 region contains sequences necessary for viral RNA polymerase binding, either alone or in combination with quence (UGAAUGAAGUU) were tested for the ability to form complexes with uninfected and MHV, strain JHM (MHV-JHM)-infected cytoplasmic extracts.

As coronaviruses undergo re-an 11-nt mutation, with cell lysates, decreased the amount of the 103-and 80-kDa proteins in the complex combination at high frequency (Liao and Lai, 1992) , we determined if the mG1 RNA sequence was maintained to undetectable levels, and strongly reduced the binding of the 120-kDa protein (Fig. 4A, lanes 4 and 5) .

Quantitative analysis indicated that replication of positive-strand mG1 RNA was reduced to 27% of that observed for DE25 RNA, while mB4 and mC5 RNA replication was 96 and 89% of DE25, respectively (Fig. 6C) . These results differed from those shown in Fig. 5 , where the replication of mB4 and mC5 RNA were strongly reduced relative to wild type, while mG1 RNA replication was only moderately decreased compared to DE25 RNA. Again, RT-PCR demonstrated the synthesis of negativestrand DI RNA from each transfected DI RNA (Fig. 6B) . Sequencing data revealed that all three DI RNAs, mG1, mB4 and mC5, had been converted to the wild-type sequence, presumably by recombination (Fig. 6C) .

Results indicated that a ratio of one is obtained at a value of 9.75 for DE25 cDNA, whereas the same ratio is obtained at a value of 3 for mG1 cDNA. Thus a 3.25-fold difference between the two samples was demonstrated. These results indicated that synthesis of negative-strand mG1 RNA is approximately 31% of wild-type DE25 RNA, which is similar to the effect on positive-strand replication of mG1 RNA relative to the wild-type DE25 (27%, Fig. 6C ).",

In the first hypothesis, the upstream protein-binding tion level of either DI RNA was greatly decreased compared to that of wild type. However, there was not an motif does not function in RNA replication; the residual low-level protein-binding activity of the 3 most motif absolute correlation between the effect of a given mutation on protein-binding activity and RNA replication. allows for a low level of replication sufficient for rescue of the mutated DI by recombination with helper virus.

The upstream element would provide a degree of redundancy for the MHV 81, and 55 kDa.

The identity and biological functions of these proteins in viral replication in MHV RNA synthesis, could not completely compensate for the mutation in the mG1 RNA.
