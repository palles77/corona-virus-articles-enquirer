Dogs were examined on admission to the shelter and those without respiratory signs of disease were assigned daily, on a rotating basis, to receive one of three vaccines. We enrolled 972 healthy dogs. Dogs were monitored for up to 30 days post-vaccination for coughing and other clinical signs of respiratory disease. Thirty-three (10.7%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 7.2, 14.2) dogs in the IN-BP group, 36 (10.2%; 95% CI: 7.0, 13.4) dogs in the IN-BPA group, and 42 (13.5%; 95% CI: 9.7, 17.3) dogs in the IN-P group coughed spontaneously for \u22651 day within 30 days of vaccination (P = 0.37). The IN-BP and IN-BPA vaccines were 20.7 and 24.4% effective, respectively, in reducing coughing compared with a placebo vaccine. The strongest prognostic factor for coughing (regardless of vaccine group) was the number of days spent at the shelter, with each additional day increasing the risk of coughing by 3% (95% CI: 0.5, 6.3). The low incidence of coughing in the shelter during this study precluded observation of differences in vaccine effectiveness. No differences in vaccine-associated adverse events (coughing, sneezing, nasal or ocular discharge) were noted during the first 3 days post-administration or thereafter.",

            "text": "Infectious tracheobronchitis (kennel cough) is a clinical syndrome of dogs characterized by acute onset of a dry, hacking cough (often followed by retching or gagging on mucous secretions) (Appel and Percy, 1970; Bemis et al., 1977a; Shade and Goodnow, 1979; Azetaka and Konishi, 1988) . Kennel cough can be due to a single pathogen or to a complex of bacteria and/or viruses (Appel and Percy, 1970; Bemis et al., 1977a; Appel, 1981) . The primary bacterium associated with kennel cough is Bordetella bronchiseptica (Bemis et al., 1977a) . Signs of infection due to B. bronchiseptica typically persist for 1-2 weeks, but organisms can be shed for 2-3 months following clinical recovery (Bemis et al., 1977a) . Dogs can be resistant to re-infection for approximately 12 months following recovery (Bemis et al., 1977b) . Mycoplasma spp., Pastuerella multocida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli have been isolated from the respiratory tract of dogs and also might cause signs of kennel cough (Bemis et al., 1977b; Wagener et al., 1984) . Primary viral pathogens implicated in kennel cough include canine-adenovirus type 2 and canine-parainfluenza virus (Appel and Percy, 1970; Azetaka and Konishi, 1988) . Other viruses suspected of causing kennel cough include canine-adenovirus type 1, canine-herpesvirus, canine-distemper virus, and canine-reovirus types 1-3 (Dhein and Gorham, 1986; Appel and Binn, 1987) . Transmission of pathogens associated with kennel cough is both by direct contact and indirectly by aerosolized droplets from coughing or sneezing dogs and by fomites (such as dishes, and the clothing and hands of dog handlers) (Ford and Vaden, 1990) .",

Signs of kennel cough often occur within 5-10 days (Appel, 1981) after admission to a shelter and morbidity can be as high as 50% among susceptible dogs; mortality is usually low (Appel and Binn, 1987) .

Furthermore, signs of kennel cough might not become apparent until a dog is adopted-causing concern and frustration among new owners.",

            "text": "Methods to prevent kennel cough include vaccination of dogs as soon as possible following admission to a shelter, quarantine of newly introduced dogs, isolation of sick dogs, and adequate sanitation and ventilation. Commercial vaccines are either killed or modified live for parenteral or intranasal (IN) administration. Ten to 14 days usually are required for partial immunity to develop following subcutaneous administration, and a second dose is required 2-4 weeks later. IN modified-live vaccines usually produce a rapid, localized (mucosal) protection (Shade and Goodnow, 1979; Bey et al., 1981; Glickman and Appel, 1981; Kontor et al., 1981) and protective immunity can develop within 4 days following a single dose (Bey et al., 1981) . IN vaccination has been recommended for use during outbreaks or when exposure is imminent (such as prior to boarding, being placed in a shelter, or attending a dog show) (Appel and Binn, 1987) . Shelters usually do not have adequate space to quarantine vaccinated dogs to allow protective immunity to develop or to isolate symptomatic dogs. Use of bleach solutions for cleaning cages and bedding, use of disposable gloves and dishware, diligent hand washing, and adequate ventilation/filtration to reduce the concentration of viral and bacterial particles in the environment also help to prevent the spread of kennel cough (Ford and Vaden, 1990) .",

In May 2000, a higher-than-expected incidence of coughing in dogs (approximately 50%) was noted at the Tippecanoe County Humane Society (TCHS) in Lafayette, Indiana. A placebo-controlled trial was initiated at the TCHS to compare the effectiveness of two commercial IN vaccines (containing B. bronchiseptica and canine-parainfluenza virus with or without canine-adenovirus) with a placebo IN vaccine and with each other, for the prevention of kennel cough. Secondary objectives were to determine prognostic factors for development of kennel cough and the frequency of vaccine-associated adverse events.",

Dogs admitted to TCHS more than once during the study period were included in the vaccine trial on their first admission only. Eligible dogs were assigned to one of three vaccine groups on a rotating-day basis. The first day at the shelter, apparently healthy dogs received either an IN vaccination containing B. bronchiseptica and canine-parainfluenza virus (Intra-Trac \u00ae II, Schering-Plough Animal Health Corporation, Omaha, NE) (IN-BP), an IN vaccine containing B. bronchiseptica and canine parainfluenza virus plus canine adenovirus (Bronchi-Shield \u00ae III, Fort Dodge Laboratories, Fort Dodge, IA) (IN-BPA), or a placebo IN (IN-P) vaccine consisting of a sterile diluent labeled as an experimental vaccine. Active vaccines were packaged in the commercially available form. All dogs admitted on a given day received the same vaccine. Dogs were housed in one of the three rooms of the shelter based on availability of kennel space on the admission date; small dogs and puppies were housed in the smallest room containing the smallest kennels. Therefore, no attempt was made to segregate unvaccinated dogs or to group dogs by admission date (and thus by vaccine). As necessary to facilitate cleaning, dogs were moved from one kennel to another during their stay in the shelter. Dogs were observed daily for coughing, sneezing, or nasal or ocular discharge, by shelter staff during activities of cleaning, feeding, and placement of new dog admissions into neighboring kennels. When these signs were observed by staff members, managers confirmed the observations and noted the signs on a reporting form. The TCHS admission date, the type of vaccine administered (by manufacturer's name), and the date of vaccine administration were recorded in each dog's written and computer records; this was the only indication that the dog was part of the study and of the vaccine it had received.",

Prognostic factors for kennel cough were evaluated using logistic regression (odds ratios (OR)). The distributions of continuous variables were checked for log-linearity. Univariable logistic regression was used to determine OR, 95% CI of the OR, and significance values for each prognostic factor. Factors that changed ORs for other factors in logistic models by >10% were retained in multivariable models.

IN vaccines might also be more effective in protecting unvaccinated dogs by producing \"herd immunity\" in the shelter population, because vaccine antigens can be spread from dog to dog. Because the population in a shelter is dynamic, more effective vaccines are required to achieve herd immunity. Local humoral immunity in the upper-respiratory tract appears to be important in preventing infection with B. bronchiseptica (Bemis et al., 1977b) and canine-parainfluenza (Kontor et al., 1981) . Thus, IN vaccines prevent infection and decrease signs of disease compared with parenteral vaccines that do not act locally to prevent pathogen entry.",

However, there were no significant differences in host or environmental characteristics at baseline among dogs in the three vaccine groups (Table 1) . Although viral and bacterial cultures were performed at the start and near the conclusion of the trial, the pattern of pathogens in the shelter was not monitored throughout the trial. Some upper-respiratory signs of disease might, therefore, have been caused by pathogens for which antigens were not present in the vaccine. The finding of B. bronchiseptica before the study started confirmed that this organism was present, and at least in part responsible for the rate of coughing reported to us. The finding of canine-adenovirus months later suggests that at least in this shelter at this time, this pathogen might have contributed to clinical disease and argues in favor of trivalent vaccine use. Staff members were not blinded to the vaccines given the dogs. Because this study was not funded and used commercially packaged vaccines (each of which had a distinct appearance and delivery system), the simplest procedure was rotating-day assignment. Owners could discover the name of the manufacturer of the vaccines given to their dogs within the adoption paperwork. It is possible that the lack of blinding contributed to the small differences seen in this study. For example, if there had been an expectation that the experimental vaccine would be effective, then the increased coughing incidence in the IN-P group might actually have been under-reported-leading to decreased effectiveness for the active vaccines. On the other hand, potential misclassification of coughing might have resulted in either under-or over-reporting of coughing in the other vaccine groups, again making it difficult to discern true incidence (Rothman and Greenland, 1998) . Ideally, vaccines would have been packaged identically with no distinguishing characteristics and with a coding scheme for their identification. In this small municipal shelter, with a limited number of staff members and without funding, the practical solution was the field trial we conducted.",
