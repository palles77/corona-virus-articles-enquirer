We suppose that the pathogenesis of a mild virus could be exacerbated by the local reactivation of human herpesvirus. 7e10 From a public health point of view, in the Asylum Seekers Centre of Castelnuovo di Porto, one of the largest in Europe, between 600 and 750 migrants are hosted (during the outbreak period 653). The center is housed in a two-storey building divided into sectors with separate access routes. In each room, there are around four to eight people. Small cultural and linguistic enclaves are housed in the different sectors of the center. Although there are no formal separations, it is infrequent that the different groups share the spaces dedicated to housing. Even the common areas such as meeting rooms, spaces dedicated to religious practices, and the canteen are generally frequented at different times by the different enclaves. The division of the building into separate sectors and the previously described behaviors of the various cultural communities probably prevented the spread of the epidemic and allowed the health professionals to concentrate on the prevention efforts to close contacts of the observed febrile syndrome cases.",

All patients underwent clinical and blood tests aimed at identifying the possible pathogen. All possible close contacts with sick people were asked to visit within 24 h of onset of symptoms: in detail, 'close contacts' were considered in those who had shared rooms and people visiting patients routinely. These people, if asymptomatic, were monitored daily at the clinic in the following 7 days. The prevention measures adopted by the IHF team were put in place at the time of detection of the third case of febrile syndrome. The implementation of the preventive measures such as air isolation, contact tracing, and active clinical surveillance of close contacts allowed to get evident decrease of the number of cases and rapid control of the outbreak within about two weeks. Interestingly, we believe that a key factor in the management of the epidemic has been the availability of an adequate ratio between the number of subjects evaluated and the size of the medical staff available. In fact, the total health workforce-to-population hosted ratio was 0.026 (17e653). Considering that the organization of the ASC healthcare service provided for the presence of a doctor and two nurses 24 h a day, the daily ratio was 1 healthcare professional to 217.6 asylum seekers. Furthermore, during the epidemic spread, the medical staff was boosted with a second medical doctor, completely devoted to the screening of close contacts.",

It is conceivable that microbiological culture and molecular testing should be a requisite to improve infection control and epidemic prevention. Refugees at their arrival in a new country, even in good health status, can be more vulnerable to disease especially when living in close contact with each other. In these conditions, epidemiological monitoring and microbiological surveillance are recommended to avoid outbreaks or epidemics potentially spreading also in community and to guarantee public health.",
