We have recently shown that 21 aa substitutions and a 7-aa insert in the N-terminal region of S are associated with the extended host range of a virus variant derived from murine cells persistently infected with the A59 strain of MHV (MHV-A59). We used targeted RNA recombination (TRR) to generate isogenic viruses that differ from MHV-A59 by the 21 aa substitutions or the 7-aa insert in S. Only viruses with both the 21 aa substitutions and the 7-aa insert in S infected hamster, feline, and monkey cells. These viruses also infected murine cells in the presence of blocking anti-mCEACAM1a antibodies. Thus, relatively few changes in the N-terminal region of S1 are sufficient to permit MHV-A59 to interact with alternative receptors on murine and non-murine cells.",

Coronaviruses have large RNA genomes that probably exist as a heterogeneous RNA quasi-species due to an error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and a high rate of recombination (Lai and Holmes, 2001) . Despite this genetic diversity, many coronaviruses cause disease in a single host species or several closely related host species (Siddell and Snijder, 1998) . With the recent emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that can cause lower respiratory tract disease in humans Ksiazek et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003) , a better understanding of how coronaviruses jump to a new host species is clearly needed.",

For example, cell lines from host species that are normally resistant to group I coronaviruses are rendered susceptible to infection by transfection with cDNA encoding the species-specific aminopeptidase N (APN) (Delmas et al., 1992; Tresnan et al., 1996; Yeager et al., 1992) . The 180-kDa S glycoprotein of murine coronavirus [murine hepatitis virus (MHV)] is a type I viral fusion protein that mediates both receptor binding and fusion activities (Bosch et al., 2003; Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001) . S is posttranslationally cleaved by a cellular protease into 90-kDa S1 and S2 proteins that remain noncovalently associated on the MHV virion. Cleavage of S may enhance cell -cell fusion and viral infectivity, although the uncleaved S of MHV mutants can mediate cell -cell fusion and fusion with host cell membranes (Bos et al., 1997; Frana et al., 1985; Taguchi, 1993) .",

The specificity of MHV strains for susceptible mice and murine cell lines is determined by the binding of S to the amino (N)-terminal Ig-like domain of the murine carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule 1a (mCEACAM1a) (Beauchemin et al., 1999; Dveksler et al., 1993; Yokomori and Lai, 1992) . Binding of the N-terminal domain of mCEACAM1a to S1 on MHV virions at 37 jC induces an irreversible conformational change in S2 that neutralizes virus and exposes a hydrophobic domain that presumably initiates fusion with host cell membranes (Gallagher, 1997; Matsuyama and Taguchi, 2002; Miura et al., 2004; Zelus et al., 2003) . Mutational analysis and the crystal structure of mCEA-CAM1a [1, 4] suggest that residues in the CCV loop and the CV h sheet in the N-terminal domain of mCEACAM1a comprise the docking site for MHV (Rao et al., 1997; Tan et al., 2002; Wessner et al., 1998) .",

Twenty-four point mutations and a 21-bp insert in the S gene result in 21 aa substitutions (Table 1) in the N -terminus and a 7-aa insert (TRTKKVP) at aa 494 in the S glycoprotein of MHV/BHK. To determine whether the 21 aa substitutions, the 7-aa insert, or both the 21 aa substitutions and the 7-aa insert in S are sufficient to expand the host range of MHV-A59, we used targeted RNA recombination (TRR) to introduce the mutations found in the S gene of MHV/BHK into the genome of MHV-A59. Donor RNAs, transcribed in vitro from mutant pMH54 constructs, were transfected into feline (Fcwf) cells that had been inoculated with the chimeric helper virus fMHV (Kuo et al., 2000) . The infected and transfected Fcwf cells were immediately overlaid onto monolayers of murine (17 Cl 1) cells to select for isogenic recombinant viruses that had gained the ability to infect murine cells due to a crossover event upstream of the S gene (Navas and Weiss, 2003) . For each mutant pMH54 construct: SA59+i, S21BHK, S21BHK+i , and S21BHK+i(R!L) (Fig. 1) , three recombinant viruses (A, B, and C) were independently recovered and plaquepurified to control for adventitious mutations that might arise in the S gene or in the rest of the viral genome. In addition, in every experiment, wild-type pMH54 RNA was used to reconstitute wild-type MHV-A59 virus (SA59) in triplicate.",

To further characterize the interaction between the mutant viruses and mCEACAM1a, we examined the binding of recombinant S proteins to soluble mCEACAM1a [1, 4] . Full-length, anchored wild type, and mutant S proteins were generated using a vaccinia virus expression system. The amount of S proteins in clarified cell extracts was normalized by immunoblotting with polyclonal anti-S A04 serum. Cell extracts were incubated with immobilized mCEACAM1a[1,4] that had been incubated with the blocking anti-mCEACAM1a MAb-CC1 or an isotypematched control MAb. The binding of both wild type and mutant S proteins to mCEACAM1a was inhibited by MAb-CC1 (Fig. 6) . The MAb-CC1 blockade of mCEA-CAM1a[1,4] did not prevent the binding of polyclonal anti-CEACAM1a 649 serum to mCEACAM1a (data not shown), indicating that additional epitopes on mCEACAM1a were not sterically inhibited by MAb-CC1. These results show that 21 aa substitutions, the 7-aa insert, or both in S did not prevent the binding of MHV-A59 to mCEACAM1a.",

Although Syrian hamster (BHK) cells are not susceptible to MHV-A59 infection, BHK cells stably transfected with mCEACAM1a[1 -4] (called BHK+mCEACAM1a) are productively infected by MHV-A59 (Dveksler et al., 1991) . MHV-A59, MHV/BHK, and the 14 recombinant viruses were inoculated at an MOI of 10, as determined by plaque assay on murine 17 Cl 1 cells. Although MHV-A59, MHV/BHK, and the recombinant viruses infected BHK+mCEACAM1a cells, only MHV/BHK and the S21BHK+i viruses infected BHK cells (Fig. 8) . The S21BHK+i viruses induced syncytia in BHK cells, but MHV/BHK did not. The S of the S21BHK+i viruses was cleaved into 90-kDa S1 and S2 proteins like wild-type MHV-A59, although the S of MHV/BHK was uncleaved (data not shown). S21BHK+i A also infected Chinese hamster (CHO), feline (Fcwf), and monkey (Vero 76) cells, although the SA59 A, SA59+i A, S21BHK C, and S21BHK+i(R!L) C viruses did not infect any of the non-murine cells tested. Thus, both the 21 aa substitutions and the 7-aa insert in the N-terminus of S are sufficient to extend the host range of MHV-A59.",

This study demonstrated that both the 21 aa substitutions and the 7-aa insert found in N-terminal region of S of MHV/BHK are sufficient to permit the interaction of MHV-A59 with alternative receptors on murine and non-murine cells. Interestingly, although 12 of the 21 aa substitutions lie within of the N-terminal 330 aa of S that comprise the minimal receptor binding domain (RBD) for mCEACAM1a in vitro, 9 of the 21 aa substitutions and the 7-aa insert lie outside of the RBD (Kubo et al., 1994; Tsai et al., 2003) .

The alternative receptor(s) used by the S21BHK+i viruses and MHV/BHK have not yet been identified. However, the extended host range variant MHV-H2 generated during persistent MHV infection of co-cultures of murine and hamster cells can utilize human carcinoembryonic antigen (hCEA) as a receptor (Baric et al., 1997; .",

Although the mechanisms underlying the 2002 emergence of SARS-CoV in humans have not yet been identified, the complete genome sequence of SARS-CoV (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) proved that mutation or recombination between previously known coronaviruses was not responsible for the emergence of this virus in humans. Instead, the emergence of SARS-CoV may reflect increased contact between animal reservoirs and human hosts at exotic food markets in China, genetic changes in or recombination between ancestral or previously unknown coronaviruses, or a combination of environmental and genetic changes (Cyranoski and Abbott, 2003; Holmes, 2003; Rest and Mindell, 2003; Stanhope et al., 2004; Stavrinides and Guttman, 2004) . The work described in this study suggests that relatively few aa substitutions in S may be sufficient to permit the introduction of a coronavirus into a new host species. Viruses closely related to human SARS-CoV isolates have been isolated from Himalayan palm civets and a raccoon dog . One or more of the 10 aa substitutions in S that differ between the known animal and human SARS-CoV isolates may have extended the host range of the animal virus. Further studies are needed to examine the role of genetic change in the host range of SARS-CoV to evaluate the possibility of a reintroduction of SARS-CoV in humans from zoonotic reservoirs.",

Mutant templates were amplified with cloned Pfu DNA polymerase (PFU; Stratagene) using various primer pairs as specified by the manufacturer. Mutant templates were screened by restriction enzyme digestion or sequence analysis. Site-directed mutagenesis using primers S(AvrII)+ and S(AvrII)\u00c0 (Table 4 ) was used to introduce a silent AvrII site at nt 37 and 38 of the S/pBS SK+ (Stratagene) construct. The AvrII mutation was subcloned into pBC SK+ (Stratagene) from S/pBS SK+ using BamHI sites to generate S/pBC SK+. Two fragments incorporating the 21-bp insert of MHV/BHK (ACTCG-GACTAAGAAGGTACCA) were amplified using primers A59.3 and A59.24 or A59.23 and A59.20 (Table 4 and Schickli et al., 2004) . PCR amplifications were run for five cycles of 1 min at 95 jC, 1 min at 60 jC, and 2 min at 72 jC using Pfu (Stratagene). The PCR products were mixed and amplified using primers A59.3 and A59.20 for 30 cycles as described above. The amplicon was subcloned into S/pBC SK+ using an AflII site at nt 332 and a BstEII site at nt 1508 to generate SA59+i. The 5V region of the S gene of MHV/BHK was amplified using primers S(AvrII)+ and A59.6 (Table 4 and Schickli et al., 2004) . The amplicon was subcloned into S/pBC SK+ using AvrII and BstEII to generate S21BHK+i. Sequence analysis of S21BHK+i clones identified a clone with one coding mutation (G1487T) in the S gene generating S21BHK+i(R!L). Site-directed mutagenesis using primers Span insert+ and Span insert\u00c0 (Table 4 ) was used to eliminate the 21-bp insert from S21BHK+i, and the construct was subcloned into S/pBC SK+ using AvrII and BstEII to generate S21BHK. Following assembly in S/ pBC SK+, all four S constructs were subcloned into pMH54 using AvrII and a XhoI site at nt 2486. The 5V end of each construct was sequenced by the University of Colorado Cancer Center DNA Sequencing and Analysis Core Facility using ABI Prism kits (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as previously described (Wentworth and Holmes, 2001) . Eight primers: S(IGS), A59.3, A59.4, A59.6, A59.7, A59.8, A59.13, and A59.14 ( Table 4 and Schickli et al., 2004) were used to generate overlapping sequence for each construct.",
