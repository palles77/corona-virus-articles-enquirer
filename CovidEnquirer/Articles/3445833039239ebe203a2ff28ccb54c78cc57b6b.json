New, alternative drug treatments, with fewer side effects and improved efficacy, are available. This has widened the spectrum of therapeutic possibilities for diseases that were previously treated only by surgical intervention. New drugs are available for estrus induction and pregnancy termination, as well as for the treatment of pyometra. This review summarizes the pharmacology and toxicology of reproductive agents currently in use for contraception, pyometra, dystocia, eclampsia, premature labor, agalactia, mastitis, metritis, and prostatic disorders, and compares their efficacy and safety with newer agents. Drug use and exposure during pregnancy and lactation, and subsequent risks to the fetuses, are also explored, with emphasis on antimicrobials, antifungals, anthelminthics, anesthetics, and vaccinations.",

            "text": "T he scope of all drugs used in canine and feline reproduction is too broad a topic to be reviewed in one article. There are many good articles already written on a variety of topics such as estrus induction/synchronization and pregnancy termination in canine and feline patients, and these should be referred to for more in-depth discussions. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] In general, drug options in the field of veterinary theriogenology have recently expanded, with new agents available for estrus induction (gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH] , dopamine agonists) and pregnancy termination (dopaminergic agonists, antiprogestational agents). However, current lack of availability in the United States and expense have limited the use of these agents. Because of manufacturer discontinuation of some older products and limited availability of newer agents, there has been an overall decline in drug options in some areas such as contraception. However, new therapeutic options for pyometra, dystocia, eclampsia, and premature labor are available and will be discussed. The use of therapeutic drugs during pregnancy and lactation in canine and feline patients has not been currently reviewed, and there is little to no collated information in general for many of these agents. New and potentially less harmful anesthetics, antibiotics, antifungals, anthelminthics, and vaccines that can be used during pregnancy and lactation will be discussed as well as current treatment concepts for agalactia, mastitis, metritis, and prostatic disorders.",

Although canine gestational time is consistent with the timing of hormone surges, it is not predictable based on the time from mating. In general, gestation length in dogs is relatively constant when measured from the beginning of ovulation or the ovulatory surge in luteinizing hormone (LH). Because the LH surge can be measured or estimated (via serial serum progestrone levels) with some accuracy, timing events with the LH surge as a reference point (day 0) can be helpful. The LH surge typically triggers ovulation within 2 days of the surge, and, if fertilization occurs, gestation is 64 to 66 days from the LH surge to parturition.",

[21] [22] [23] Other gonadotropins have been evaluated with limited success. 13, [24] [25] [26] PMSG has been effective, but is associated with premature luteal failure, shortened diestrus, and pregnancy loss. [27] [28] [29] Protocols using estrogens for estrus induction in bitches typically also include FSH or PMSG for folliculogenesis and HCG or LH for induction of ovulation. 1 Prolactin inhibition also plays a role in interestrous intervals and is believed to have effects on gonadotropin release and ovarian response to gonadotropins. Suppression of prolactin release by dopamine agonists (bromocriptine, cabergoline) shortens the duration of anestrus and induces estrus in animals with prolonged anestrus. 30, 31 The dopamine agonist, bromocriptine, was the first prolactin inhibitor studied in dogs for estrus induction, but resulted in significant vomiting in dogs. 25, 32 A newer agent, cabergoline (Galastop, Dostinex), has been shown to induce estrus in most bitches (0.005 mg/kg orally daily, until 3-8 days after onset of proestrus or day 40) with fewer side effects. 3, 33 The drug is available in generic form (Par Pharmaceutical, Inc., Woodcliff Lake, NJ), but remains relatively expensive ($160.00/8 tabs or approximately $20.00/tab) and difficult to dose accurately in small dogs. Cabergoline is only available as a 0.5-mg tablet that is inactivated over time in aqueous solutions containing water. For accurate dosing of small animals, tablets can either be compounded into the appropriate-strength capsules, or a portion of the tablet can be crushed and diluted with fluid just before dosing. McLean and coworkers also report that cabergoline is stable for 28 days if compounded in acidic fluids (1% acetic acid solution). 34 GnRHs have also been shown to be very effective if given in pulsated fashion (0.2-0.4 g/kg every 90-minute intervals intravenously [IV] or subcutaneously [SC] for 3-9 days) to mimic the natural cycle, resulting in LH peaks at the end of proestrus. Subcutaneous administration has been noted to be more practical, but availability of the canine analog is problematic. 35, 36 However, protocols using native GnRH or its agonists via this technique are not practical for clinic purposes because of the expense, time commitment, and lack of availability of analogs. GnRH analogs (lutrelin, deslorelin, leuprolide) can also be administered as long-acting dosage forms via subcutaneous injections, mini pumps, or implants. An intranasal spray (Leuprolode; Takeda Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) has been used in one study in 14 anestrous beagle bitches and produced no negative clinical effects, but needs further evaluation. 37 Both expense and side effects may limit the use of these products. Side effects have included premature luteal failure, shortened diestrus, and pregnancy loss. 38, 39 Long-term use is also associated with pituitary overstimulation, downregulation of GnRH receptors, suppression of LH, decreased progesterone secretion, and decreased luteal responsiveness to LH. 1 A synthetic, sustained release GnRH analog (deslorelin) was marketed for several years for equine patients and was shown to be effective in canine patients. Ovuplant (Fort Dodge Animal Health, Overland Park, KS) was a biodegradable, subdermal implant containing 2.1 mg of deslorelin. Studies in dogs demonstrated fast, reliable, synchronous estrus. 39, 40 The product was taken off the market in 2005 because of manufacturing difficulties. Currently, no commercially available replacement exists. Compounding pharmacies have attempted to provide deslorelin in various formulations. BET Compounding Pharmacy (Lexington, KY) makes an injectable deslorelin in a proprietary sustained-release vehicle (BioRelease) that contains 1.5 mg/mL of deslorelin. The drug is not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved and lacks the stringent oversight of an FDA manufacturer's approved facility.",

The risk for pyometra is believed to be 58 Administration of estrogens for the purpose of pregnancy termination has also been associated with an increased incidence of pyometra in dogs. Animals can present with purulent vaginal discharge, vomiting, inappetence, polyuria, polydipsia, lethargy, abdominal distention, uterine rupture, or peritonitis. Septicemia, endotoxemia, tachycardia, tachypnea, fever, or subnormal body temperature may result. Rapid deterioration, sepsis, and death may occur if treatment is not initiated early in the course of the disease. Pyometra is typically secondary to pathologic changes induced in the endometrium from progestrone exposure over successive heat cycles. 59 Pyometra in cats is less common, likely because of the fact that they are induced ovulators with more limited progesterone exposure. However, pyometra is common in catteries with intact queen populations. Progesterone causes endometrial hyperplasia, luminal fluid accumulation, suppressed leukocyte activity, and decreased myometrial activity. Reduced contractility and fluid accumulation favor ascending bacterial infections that are typically due to enteric bacteria. Escherichia coli is the most common isolate and is typically the only isolate. Other isolates have included Streptococcus spp, Staphylococcus spp, Proteus, Klebsiella, Serratia, Pseudomonas, Enterococcus, and Salmonella. 60 Treatment of pyometra Treatment of pyometra typically involves immediate intravenous hydration and initiation of antibiotic therapy. Ideally, culture and sensitivity should be performed before initiating empiric antibiotic therapy. Most Escherichia coli isolates found in pyometra are identical to isolates found in the animal's urine or blood and share the same sensitivity patterns. 61 E. coli isolates found in pyometra may be resistant to 2 or more antibiotics. 62 Ideally, a fluoroquinolone (enrofloxacin, marbofloxacin) in combination with an extended-spectrum penicillin (Timentin) or ampicil- lin may be administered acutely. Fluoroquinolones penetrate into uterine tissues at concentrations greater than that of plasma. 63 Alternative antibiotics that cover E. coli include; aminoglycosides, trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, third-generation cephalosporins, and chloramphenicol. 60 After stabilization of the patient by correcting hypotension and dehydration, subsequent ovariohysterectomy should be performed. After culture and susceptibility results, antibiotics should be tailored to the specific isolate and patient, and therapy continued for up to 3 weeks. Open pyometra (draining) has a much more favorable prognosis than closed pyometra. Bitches and queens with good breeding potential (less than 5 years of age, healthy) whose owners decline ovariohysterectomy can be offered new agents and techniques that have been attempted with some success. Naturally occurring prostaglandins (PGF-2\u2423 ) have been administered to cause luteolysis and evacuation of uterine contents in open pyometra, but should not be used in closed pyometra because of the potential for uterine rupture. PGE (misoprostol) can be administered intravaginally (1-3 g/kg every 12-24 hours) in an attempt to relax the cervix before PGF-2\u2423 administration. Synthetic prostaglandins have been used in canine patients to date, including cloprostenol and alfaprostol. Synthetic prostaglandin are more specific for uterine smooth muscle, causing fewer observed side effects (nausea, diarrhea, cramping, panting). Prostaglandins stimulate uterine contractions and variably relax the cervix, causing evacuation and drainage of purulent uterine contents. The dose of prostaglandin depends on the drug used. The lowest effective dose should be used; this has not been established in all cases. PGF-2\u2423 is administered at 0.1 mg/kg SC every 12 hours for 48 hours, then at 0.2 mg/kg SC every 12 hours to effect. Cloprostenol is administered at 1 to 3 g/kg every 12 to 24 hours. Therapy may be necessary for 7 to 10 days. 61, 64, 65 Side effects after the initial doses can include restlessness, panting, vomiting, elevated heart rate, fever, and defecation. To clear the uterus of infected material, prostaglandin administration should be continued as long as abnormal fluid is seen within the uterine lumen ultrasonographically. Progesterone levels should fall to \u03fd2 ng/mL.",

Despite normocalcemia in many patients, administration of calcium gluconate usually results in improved myometrial tone. Calcium gluconate 10% is commonly used in bitches either IV (0.2 mL/kg) or SC (1 mL/4.5 kg) every 4 to 6 hours.

            "text": "Oxytocin can be administered via various routes (intravenous, subcutaneous, and intramuscular). Recent data suggest that the ideal administration of oxytocin is by repeat small doses instead of large single doses. Using a tocodynamometer, large doses of oxytocin (5 U) were noted to produce uterine tetany, whereas smaller doses (0.25 U) produced effective contractions. 74 It is therefore suggested that initial doses of 0.1 U are given IM or SC and increased incrementally every 30 to 40 minutes to a maximum dose of 5 U. 73, 75 This method reduces the associated deleterious side effects of oxytocin (uterine rupture, placental separation, fetal death, maternal vasodilation, and hypotension) and prevents excessive disruption of blood flow to the fetus and placenta. 75, 76 Although incremental small doses of oxytocin can have improved outcome for dystocia, only one third of canine patients respond to oxytocin, suggesting that calcium depletion also plays a large role. 77 Hypoglycemia may also contribute to primary inertia (primarily toy breeds) and should be carefully monitored for. In canine patients, hyperglycemia can occur because of high cortisol concentrations, so that glucose should not be administered unless hypoglycemia is documented. 70, 78 In queens, medical therapy for dystocia is less successful but may be attempted. Dosages of 0.5 to 2 mL of calcium gluconate (10%) can be administered slowly SC or IV with monitoring. Oxytocin may then be administered at 0.10 to 0.25 U SC or IM. If this fails, 0.25 mL of dextrose (50%) diluted to 2.0 mL in sterile water or saline solution can can be administered by slow intravenous infusion. Failure of effective labor to begin is an indication for likely surgical intervention. 79 Eclampsia Eclampsia is typically a direct result of hypocalcemia. In canine patients, a total serum calcium concentration of \u03fd6.5 mg/dL or an ionized serum calcium of \u03fd2.4 to 3.2 mg/dL or \u03fd0.8 mmol/L (based on ionized serum calcium in dogs being 55% of total serum calcium) confirms the diagnosis. 80 The normal reference range for total canine serum calcium is 9.7 to 11.5 mg/dL at our institute, but varies dependent on the laboratory used (8.7-12.0 mg/dL). Puerperal hypocalcemia is considered a life-threatening condition typically seen around 2 to 4 weeks after whelping, but can occur in the prepartum period as well. Eclampsia is primarily seen in smaller breeds with large litters. Heavy lactational demands here cause an imbalance in calcium stores that cannot be compensated for by dietary calcium intake. In dogs, hypocalcemia has an excitatory effect on nerves and muscle cells. Bitches may initially develop facial pruritus, panting, or restlessness, which may progress into tremors, twitching, generalized seizures, hyperthermia, tachycardia, polyuria, polydipsia, and vomiting. 81 Behavioral changes may also occur (whining, salivation, aggression, hypersensitivity, disorientation). Hypoglycemia, toxicosis, epilepsy, metritis, and mastitis should be ruled out.",

In Peru and Mexico, rates have been reported to be as high as 25% in dogs. 91 B. canis is a Gram-negative intracellular coccobacillus that is spread by inhalation, oral ingestion, or contact with the fetus or fetal membranes after abortions/ stillbirths of infected fetuses. Venereal transmission or transmission through the genital, oronasal, or conjunctival mucosa also occurs. 92 Abortion occurs between 45 and 59 days of pregnancy. B. canis is most prevalent in large breeding kennels where contact with infective discharges or fetal tissues occurs. Because there is no permanent cure for B. canis, infected animals must be eliminated from breeding. The infection affects both females and males.

Eradication is difficult and may take 5 to 7 months in closed kennels and may never be achieved in open kennels. Privately owned bitches should be tested before each breeding, and stud dogs annually. Even maiden bitches should be tested before breeding because of the potential for oronasal mucosal transmission.

Protocols that have been used have included minocycline (25 mg/kg orally daily \u03eb 14 days) plus dihydrostreptomycin (5 mg/kg IM twice per day \u03eb 7 days). High-dose enrofloxacin (5 mg/kg orally twice per day) for 4 weeks has also been administered successfully to dogs in one kennel in which 12 dogs were found to be positive for B. canis by either blood culture or serology. Results here demonstrated equal efficacy to prior studies using streptomycin combined with tetracycline or minocycline, but had fewer side effects. However, none of the dogs in this study showed symptoms of chronic infection, diskospondylitis, ocular infection, or testicular infection. [92] [93] [94] Treatment remains challenging, and close monitoring for relapse is necessary. 91 In humans, most protocols call for at least a month of therapy. Humans with Brucella spp including B. canis have been successfully treated with gentamicin (initially \u03eb 1-2 weeks) in combination with doxycycline (42 days orally). 95, 96 Clinical resolution of B. canis ocular inflammation was noted in one canine case using gentamicin SC, with oral ciprofloxacin and doxycycline. With the addition of rifampin, indirect fluorescent antibody titer was reduced by half, and agar gel immunodiffusion test became negative. 97 A meta-analysis review of human brucellosis cases suggests that higher relapse occurs without the use of an aminoglycoside, and that gentamicin is not inferior to streptomycin. Doxycycline with rifampin was found to be better than quinolones with rifampin. Combination therapy with 2 or 3 antibiotics was better than single-agent therapy, particularly if an aminoglycoside was included. Optimal treatment was suggested to be doxycycline-aminoglycoside-rifampin, with the aminoglycosides given for 7 to 14 days and doxycycline-rifampin for 6 to 8 weeks. 98, 99 Because of the intracellular nature of this organism, and the fact that it can be harbored in pharmacologically difficult areas for drugs to penetrate (prostate), neutering, and, at minimum, a month of enrofloxacin (5 mg/kg orally twice per day), should be administered. Animals should be followed up closely, and if they remain culture or serologically positive, a 1-to 2-week course of an aminoglycoside, along with an antibiotic that penetrates intracellularly (doxycycline) and rifampin, may be an effective cure.",

Systemic fungal infections including Histoplasmosis, Blastomycosis, Coccidioidomycosis, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, and Candida have an increased incidence in human patients during pregnancy and may be seen with higher incidence in pregnant animals. [100] [101] [102] In humans, diagnosis of disseminated disease was strongly associated with the trimester of pregnancy: first trimester \u03ed 50% of cases, second trimester \u03ed 62% of cases, and third trimester \u03ed 96% of cases. 103 Antifungal agents used in the treatment of severe systemic fungal infections include fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, flucytosine, voriconazole, caspofungin, and potassium iodine. Use of these agents during pregnancy has been evaluated in human and animal studies and associated with a significant risk of teratogenic effects. 100 Studies in mice with single-dose exposures to fluconazole and itraconazole showed teratogenic effects to be both concentration and gestational exposure time dependent. 104, 105 In a recent study evaluating outcomes of 229 pregnant women exposed to itraconazole at different stages during pregnancy, there was no difference in major malformations noted in infants, but the rate of pregnancy loss was higher and birth rates were lower in women exposed to itraconazole. 106 Orally administered ketoconazole and flucytosine have been reported to be teratogenic and embryotoxic in animals, and should not be used during pregnancy. 107 Because of the high risk of significant teratogenic effects to the growing fetuses, these agents are primarily placed in Pregnancy Category C. The triazole derivatives (voriconazole, posoconazole, and ravuconazole) are associated with an even greater teratogenic risk, and are placed in Pregnancy Category D. This chemical class has been found to alter normal hindbrain development, resulting in severe teratogenic effects in rodents. 108 Although amphotericin B has multiple side effects associated with its use (nephrotoxicity, hypersensitivity, fever, hypotension, nausea, vomiting) it is the only antifungal agent that has broad-spectrum coverage for most organisms that cause life-threatening systemic mycosis and has limited teratogenic risk (Pregnancy Category B). 100 Side effects are significantly improved with the use of liposomal amphotericin B, although it is more expensive. Ideally, liposomal amphotericin B would be the drug of choice to use in pregnant animals with life-threatening fungal infections, if the benefits of treatment outweighed the risks.",

The commercial capsules have limited absorption unless given with an acidic fluid (juice or colas).

Here, there is a much greater risk of embryotoxicity and teratogenic risk to the fetuses depending on the stage of pregnancy and the exposure time to the anesthetics. Most induction agents, narcotics, and muscle relaxants are devoid of teratogenic fetal effects. To date, in human medicine, parenteral anesthetics including thiopental, etomidate, and ketamine have not been reported to have any negative effects on fetuses. Nitrous oxide, halothane, and isoflurane have had mixed results, with some evidence demonstrating increased incidence of spontaneous abortions and skeletal defects if first-trimester exposure occurs.

Fetal sheep have developed hypercarbic acidosis within 1 hour of 1 minimum alveolar concentration isoflurane anesthesia to the mother. 125 Postdelivery Anesthesia may interfere with involution of the uterus.

The lifecycle of T. canis may explain the difficulty in eradicating this organism. Large numbers of eggs are produced by the female worm that, once excreted into the environment, may last for years. The larvae of T. canis migrate through tissues and become encysted. By mechanisms believed to be hormonally related in late pregnancy, encysted larvae become reactivated during pregnancy and are passed on either transplancetally (98%) or neonatally, via milk (1.5%). 129 The lifecycles of T. cati and T. leonina differ in that either no prenatal infection occurs (T. cati), or migration is limited to the intestinal wall (T. leonina), so that transplacental or transmammary infection does not occur. Because transplacental passage of feline roundworms (T. cati), and their reactivation, is not considered significant, worming kittens rather than the queen may be preferred.",

Vaccination of the mother during lactation will not provide protection to pups or kittens, but will not harm them. For neonates unable to nurse, removed from the mother, or of unknown maternal background, where colostrum ingestion may have been limited, immune serum should be given (oral if within the first 48 hours of life, parenterally if \u03fe 48 hours of age); this permits vaccinations to be initiated at the routine age (6 weeks). Boosters should be continued with modified live vaccinations every 3 to 4 weeks until the animals are 15 to 16 weeks old. 152 When pregnant animals are vaccinated during late pregnancy, there will be high levels of maternal antibodies in litter mates that may persist well out to 12 to 14 weeks. This may actually place them at increased risk of infection if vaccinated on a 6-to 8-and 12-week interval, because maternal antibodies may prevent an adequate immune response of pups at such high levels. This, of course, is dependent not only on the vaccine protocol, but also on the type of vaccination used. Ideally, another booster given at 16 to 20 weeks may be required to fully vaccinate pups whelped in this setting.",

S. aureus infection may present as gangrenous mastitis with leukocytosis and decreased platelet counts in canines. 156 Staphylococcus intermedius has been shown to experimentally induce mastitis in dogs, resulting in painful, hot, enlarged, edematous glands. 157 However, a retrospective review of canine milk isolates and mortality in pups suggests that although S. intermedius has been isolated in canine milk, it does not seem to be a cause of septicemia in neonates. 158 From a broad spectrum of isolates from milk of healthy and diseased bitches, only Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and/or B-hemolytic Streptococcus spp could be isolated from organs of their septicemia puppies. 158 For mild cases of mastitis, oral antibiotics can be administered that penetrate and concentrate into milk. Because milk is acidic, drugs that weaken bases not only distribute into milk but also get trapped into it. Cephalexin, amoxicillinclavulanate, or macrolides may be initiated empirically until culture results return. 152 Furthermore, there are many antibi-otics that should be avoided because of neonatal risks if the mother continues to nurse.

It is important to rule out inadequate sexual stimulation; this is accomplished by repeat semen collections (1 hour apart) in the presence of an estrual bitch.

BPH is extremely common in sexually intact male dogs. By the time male dogs reach 5 years of age \u03fe80% have histopathologic evidence of BPH. Dihydrotestosterone is believed to stimulate growth in both stromal and glandular prostatic compartments. Both prostatic cysts and abscesses should be ruled out via ultrasound examination, aspiration, and culture of prostatic fluid. Abscesses are a medical and surgical emergency, usually requiring antibiotics, drainage, and potentially treatment of septicemia. Clinically, dogs with prostatitis or prostatic neoplasia can have constipation, strangiuria, dysuria, and pelvic pain. Dogs with BPH can have sanguineous fluid dripping from the urethra, and may have hematuria and hemospermia, but this disease is benign otherwise. The diagnosis of specific prostatic disorders is based on physical examination, history, examination of prostatic fluids/semen, and a transabdominal prostate evaluation with possible aspirate or biopsy if indicated. 161 Many agents have been used to treat BPH including estrogenic compounds (estradiol cypionate, diethylstilbestrol) and synthetic progestins (megestrol acetate, medroxyprogesterone). However, these agents are not approved in dogs and are not recommended to treat dogs with BPH because of potential side effects (bone marrow suppression, prostatic metaplasia). 164 The use of GnRH agonists (deslorelin) at doses of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg was also effective as long as treatment was continuous, but the drug is no longer currently available on commercial markets. Finasteride, a synthetic 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor used in human medicine, has more recently been evaluated in dogs.
