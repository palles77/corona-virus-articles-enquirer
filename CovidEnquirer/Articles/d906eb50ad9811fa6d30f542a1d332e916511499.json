The genomic complexity of FCoVs was investigated using single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of N and ORF7b amplicons, and the evolutionary process was investigated by sequence-based phylogenetic analysis. SSCP analysis showed high heterogeneity of the FCoV genome which was correlated with the seriousness of the clinical form. The two genomic regions analysed showed different levels of variation; the N region demonstrated significant heterogeneity as compared to ORF7b. Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences showed the clear separation of sequences analysed on the basis of virulence and geographical origin. A maximum likelihood analysis of N and ORF7b data sets showed a situation of strong heterogeneity for the N region.",

Quasispecies are complex, dynamic distributions of non-identical but related replicons [6] , and the viral population is composed of a predominant sequence, the master sequence and a number of sequences di\u00a1ering from it to various extents.",

The pathogenesis of the disease is still not fully understood; it was thought that the development of extensive viral quasispecies might overwhelm the immune system in an already immunocompromised individual, allowing FIP to develop [8] . The reference method used to detect viral heterogeneity is cloning and sequencing a su\u2044cient number of clones [9] . Since cloning and sequencing is a laborious and expensive method, it is possible to use an alternative and quicker method of detecting quasispecies composition: single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products [10, 11] .",

Electrophoresis was performed at 200 V constant power for 4 h at room temperature. The DNA bands were subsequently visualised by the silver staining procedure (Silverxpress Silverstain Kit, Invitrogen, USA).

Then, a likelihood model was \u00a2tted to this initial tree and the parameters were re-estimated in order to obtain the optimal tree; the procedure was repeated until the likelihood values remained constant. The estimated parameters from the data sets included the Ts/Tv, the pyrimidine/purine transition ratio, the proportion of invariant sites and the K shape parameter of the Q distribution (with eight categories). A \u00a2nal neighbor-joining tree was constructed using the estimated model parameters and the HKY85 evolution model.

[26] , and has been demonstrated to be suitable for describing the behaviour of the RNA virus at the molecular level. The quasispecies structure of some RNA viruses has remarkable biological implications because, during viral replication, dynamic mutants with considerable adaptability are continuously generated. Human immunode\u00a2ciency virus type 1 is one of the most dramatic examples of viral quasispecies, but similar observations have been made for many virus populations [27] . In coronaviruses, the genomic complexity and the quasispecies nature have been well documented mainly for the murine hepatitis virus, the study model of the genus [28] . Some studies have demonstrated that FCoVs can also consist of a complex of heterogeneous variants in vivo and in vitro [13, 29] . The main purpose of this study was to understand the heterogeneity of FCoVs in vivo analysing the genomic complexity of strains from both healthy and sick cats. The quasispecies composition of FCoVs was evaluated in SSCP analysis by testing PCR fragments from the N and ORF7b regions. The SSCP assay has been shown to be a reliable tool for evaluating the heterogeneity of RNA viruses; for each lane, the number of bands visible after electrophoresis of the amplicons is proportional to the number of viral subpopulations included in a given sample. We also analysed the viral tissue distribution in the sick cats. In cat 419, the virus was seen in the following organs: kidneys, spleen, brain cortex and large intestine, while in cat 420, we detected the viruses in all the organs analysed except the brain cortex and the lungs; in cat 453, the viruses were distributed in the pericardium, lungs and liver (Table 1) . Cats with FIP demonstrated more variability in their SSCP patterns than healthy ones. Our anamnestic data supported the hypothesis that cat 419 and cat 420 became infected by contact with carrier cats and the same viral strain evolved di\u00a1erently within the diseased animals acquiring more genetic complexity. Our results showed that quasispecies composition di\u00a1ers between organs in the same cat and the heterogeneity of the FCoV genome was correlated with the seriousness of the clinical forms and the lesions of the organs. In fact, the highest variability in SSCP patterns was observed in cat 420 a\u00a1ected by systemic FIP and this was more obvious in its seriously degenerated liver and lymph nodes. The viral tissue distributions as well the genomic complexity were consistent with the seriousness of the disease, as proven by a higher distribution of the viruses in cat 420. These results con\u00a2rm the biological relevance of the quasispecies; the high mutation rate of coronaviruses contributes to their rapid evolution with the selection of new variants [30] . In some cases the new variants can escape from the immune system and are more advantageous giving rise to more serious lesions such as those observed in the liver of cat 420.",
