Within the family Felidae, only domestic cats have been documented as host species for astroviruses, but infection is cosmopolitan, having been documented in Australia (Marshall et al., 1987) , England (Harbour et al., 1987) , Germany (Herbst and Krauss, 1988) , New Zealand (Rice et al., 1993) , and the United States (Hoshino et al., 1981) . One study of fecal electron microscopy of cats found that astroviruses were the most common virus particles seen in cats with diarrhea (Marshall et al., 1987) . Serum from a human with astrovirus-associated disease was found to react with feline astrovirus, implying similarity in antigenic regions, which are primarily found in portions of the capsid (Marshall et al., 1987; Matsui et al., 1993) . Veterinary Microbiology 136 (2009) [160] [161] [162] [163] [164] [165] A Mamastrovirus was identified in an outbreak of diarrhea in cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus). Five young adult and two adult cheetahs presented with lethargy, anorexia, watery diarrhea and regurgitation over an 11-day period. Fecal samples were submitted for electron microscopy and culture. Electron microscopy results revealed particles morphologically consistent with an astrovirus, and no other viral pathogens or significant bacterial pathogens were identified. The astrovirus was confirmed and sequenced using consensus astroviral PCR, resulting in a 367 base pair partial RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (RdRp) product and a 628 base pair partial capsid product. Bayesian and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses were performed on both the RdRp and the capsid protein segments. All animals were monitored and treated with bismuth subsalicylate tablets (524 mg PO BID for 5 days), and recovered without additional intervention. This is the first report we are aware of documenting an astrovirus outbreak in cheetah.",

As stated, there are few histopathologic changes associated with astrovirus infections, and electron microscopy may lack specificity and sensitivity. Despite high prevalence in humans, human astroviruses were not recognized until 1975, and relatively few astroviruses have been identified in other species. Culture of astroviruses is difficult, and the authors are not aware of previously published broad-range PCR protocols for this group of viruses that can cause clinically significant diarrhea. Therefore, improved methods of diagnostic testing for diverse astroviruses were needed. Consensus PCR represents a rapid way to obtain DNA template from clinical samples of novel viruses suitable for sequencing (Wellehan et al., 2004) . Astroviruses are not uncommon in humans, the only hosts in which they have been well studied epidemiologically (Dennehy et al., 2001) , and it is likely that there are numerous additional astrovirus species associated with disease in other vertebrates. The methods developed in this study will be useful for rapid identification and characterization of Mamastroviruses from diverse hosts.",

The index animal was a young adult female housed with 4 other cheetah of similar age in a large outdoor, vegetated enclosure. Her initial presenting signs included mild lethargy and partial anorexia. Two days later she developed watery diarrhea and there was evidence of regurgitation in her enclosure. At this time, fecal samples were submitted for electron microscopy and culture for enteric bacterial pathogens to the state diagnostic laboratory. Culture for enteric pathogens was performed by initially culturing fecal samples on blood agar, MacConkey's and penylethyl alcohol (PEA) media. Subcultures were then placed in tetrathionate enrichment media and incubated for 24 h at 42 8C. Broth cultures were then placed onto brilliant green and chrome agar for salmonella screening. Viral screening via PCR for canine parvovirus, feline panleukopenia (McKnight et al., 2007) and corona virus (Kennedy et al., 2001) was performed by veterinary diagnostic laboratories using standard techni-ques. Within 6 days of initial onset, she had fully recovered. Over the next 5 days, four additional animals within the same enclosure developed similar clinical signs. Two additional adult animals also developed similar clinical signs within this time frame. Five of the seven affected cats were housed together in a large outdoor enclosure with a natural grass substrate. The last two animals to develop signs were housed together in a separate pen that was not adjacent to the initial site and therefore did not have direct contact with the first group to develop signs. There were no reports from the animal keepers of any gastrointestinal signs amongst themselves or in any of their personal pets during this time. Additionally, no stray animals (domestic felines) had been observed in the area surrounding the cheetah enclosures to provide a route of infection.",

Turkey astrovirus 2, an Avastrovirus, appears to have crossed from turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) to guinea fowl (family Numididae, species not given), since guineafowl sequences nest within Turkey astrovirus 2 sequences from turkeys (Cattoli et al., 2007) . Cheetahs are more closely related to the small cats, including domestic cats, than they are to other big cats (Flynn et al., 2005) . A number of other domestic cat viruses have been shown to cause disease in cheetahs. Feline parvovirus has been confirmed by sequence identification from two diseased cheetahs in Namibia (Steinel et al., 2000) . Feline coronavirus has been confirmed by sequence identification from cheetahs (Kennedy et al., 2006) . There is serological evidence for Feline herpesvirus 1 and Feline calicivirus in cheetahs (Munson et al., 2004) , and Feline herpesvirus 1 has been confirmed by sequence identification from diseased Branches with Bayesian posterior probabilities less than 50 are collapsed, and an area of trifurcation is marked by a circle.

When looking at evolutionary relationships of more distantly related organisms, the continued accrual of mutations resulting in homoplasy can diminish the ability to correctly resolve phylogeny, making a rapidly mutating gene a poor choice. Astroviral capsid proteins are the most rapidly evolving part of the virus, and analysis of only synonymous nucleotide substitutions from astroviral capsid proteins found that insufficient phylogenetic signal remained for distance based analysis (van Hemert et al., 2007a) , and significant compression of tree branches was found using maximum likelihood methods for analysis (van Hemert et al., 2007b) , which are generally superior to distance based methods.

Genes that are critical for replication and are not under heavy immune selection are usually more conserved. Other studies have found that the astroviral polymerase is the most conserved part of the genome (Jonassen et al., 2003) , and although the protease was not examined in this study, our data found that the polymerase was more conserved than the capsid. Polymerases are therefore more likely to accurately reflect the deeper history of the virus than capsid proteins. The disadvantage of the astroviral polymerase is the smaller database of sequence for comparison. The availability of more complete data sets for comparison results in greater phylogenetic resolution (Flynn et al., 2005) . However, the total number of available astrovirus sequences from any gene is still relatively small, and techniques developed in this study could lead to rapid accumulation of sequence data from the polymerase gene of additional mamastroviruses.",

The other speciose placental mammal superorder, Euarchonto-glires, has only one host from which an astrovirus is recognized, humans. Two possible explanations for this include greater distribution of astroviruses in the Laurasiatheria and lack of screening of the Euarchontoglires. Most agriculturally important or common companion mammals are in the Laurasiatheria, with only domestic rabbits falling into these categories from the Euarchontoglires. Humans have primarily valued a small number of other Euarchontoglires, such as mice, rats, and rhesus macaques, as laboratory animals. Similar reasons may have resulted in only finding avastroviruses in the order Galliformes, which are by far the most common agriculturally produced birds. Further screening of diverse species may result in a more complete picture of astrovirus evolution.",

This trend was also seen in comparison of the regions of sequence in this study (Table 1 ). This has previously been interpreted as a drive toward host codon usage. Since birds and humans are more phylogenetically different, it was interpreted as acquisition of GC by non-human mammal astroviruses from AT-rich ancestors (van Hemert et al., 2007a ). An alternate hypothesis would be the gain of AT in human and domestic poultry astroviruses from GC rich ancestors. There is evidence that adenoviruses and retroviruses become AT rich after recent host switching events (Poss et al., 2006; Wellehan et al., 2004) , and this may also be the case with astroviruses. However, there does not appear to be a difference in %GC of the cheetah astrovirus relative to the reference Feline astrovirus sequence. If AT gain is seen after host switching events in astroviruses, three possible explanations for the lack of AT bias in cheetah astrovirus relative to the domestic cat astrovirus include a very recent host switch so that loss of GC has not had time to occur, recombinant acquisition of Feline astrovirus capsid by a distinct host-adapted cheetah astrovirus, and sufficient biological similarity between cheetahs and domestic cats such that selective pressures after a host switch are minimal.",
