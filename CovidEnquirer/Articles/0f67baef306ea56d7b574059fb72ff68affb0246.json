            "text": "In eukaryotes and viruses that infect them, the 5 0 end of mRNA molecules, and also many other functionally important RNAs, are modified to form a so-called cap structure that is important for interactions of these RNAs with many nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. The RNA cap has multiple roles in gene expression, including enhancement of RNA stability, splicing, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and translation initiation. Apart from guanosine addition to the 5 0 end in the most typical cap structure common to transcripts produced by RNA polymerase II (in particular mRNA), essentially all cap modifications are due to methylation. The complexity of the cap structure and its formation can range from just a single methylation of the unprocessed 5 0 end of the primary transcript, as in mammalian U6 and 7SK, mouse B2, and plant U3 RNAs, to an elaborate m 7 Gpppm 6,6 AmpAmpCmpm 3 Um structure at the 5 0 end of processed RNA in trypanosomes, which are formed by as many as 8 methylation reactions. While all enzymes responsible for methylation of the cap structure characterized to date were found to belong to the same evolutionarily related and structurally similar Rossmann Fold Methyltransferase superfamily, that uses the same methyl group donor, S-adenosylmethionine; the enzymes also exhibit interesting differences that are responsible for their distinct functions. This review focuses on the evolutionary classification of enzymes responsible for cap methylation in RNA, with a focus on the sequence relationships and structural similarities and dissimilarities that provide the basis for understanding the mechanism of biosynthesis of different caps in cellular and viral RNAs. Particular attention is paid to the similarities and differences between methyltransferases from human cells and from human pathogens that may be helpful in the development of antiviral and antiparasitic drugs.",

For instance, in Alphaviruses, the precursor of cap0 is first methylated to a m 7 G triphosphate and only then connected to the 5 0 end of the RNA. 12 Nonsegmented negative-sense (nsNS) RNA viruses have evolved a different mechanism for mRNA cap formation in that the guanylyltransferase transfers GDP rather than GMP onto the 5 0 end of the RNA and the resulting cap structure is first monomethylated on the ribose of the first transcribed residue (yielding GpppAm structure), and only later the guanosine is methylated to m 7 G. [13] [14] [15] In addition to ribose 2 0 -O-methylation, base moieties of the first transcribed nucleosides may be methylated, thereby increasing the catalog of 5 0 cap structures. In particular, the first adenine nucleoside of the transcript is often methylated at the N 6 position. 16 In Trypanosomes, the fourth uridine residue is also methylated at the N 3 position. The role of these base methylations is unclear, and the enzymes responsible for these modifications remain to be characterized.",

This alternative cap is generated by methylation of a g-phosphate oxygen at the unprocessed 5 0 end of the primary transcript. 17 It is clear that apart from guanosine addition to the 5 0 end, essentially all cap modifications are due to methylations. The cap structure of mRNAs in trypanosomes, m 7 Gpppm 6,6 Am-pAmpCmpm 3 Um, is formed with as many as 8 methylation steps. In all cases that have been experimentally characterized to date, methylations of caps in all organisms and viruses are catalyzed by S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferases ( Table 1) . For the most common types of methylation reactions implicated in cap modification, the crystal structures of the representative proteins have been determined ( Table 2) . All cap methyltransferases characterized structurally belong to the Rossmann Fold Methyltransferase (RFM) superfamily. 18 The topology of the RFM fold is very similar to the typical Rossmann fold (#6-#5-#4-#1-#2-#3), with an additional, 7 th \u00df-strand inserted into the sheet in an antiparallel manner (#6-\"7-#5-#4-#1-#2-#3) (Fig. 1) . 18, 19 The methyl group donor (SAM) binding site is formed by loops following strands 1, 2, and 3, while the substrate to be methylated is typically bound by loops following strands 4, 5, and 6. Various families of RFM enzymes exhibit fusions with other domains, extensions of termini, and insertions within the conserved RFM domain, in particular following strand 5. These elaborations of the common fold are often involved in substrate binding or in oligomerization. 20, 21 In this review, we discuss cellular and viral methyltransferases involved in 5 0 cap RNA biosynthesis, with emphasis on the sequence structure relationships in the light of the experimentally determined structures of enzymes complexed with their ligands. We focus on comparison of enzymes with similar activities that generate products with chemically similar structures.",

Abd1 is a founding member of a protein family that is strongly conserved in eukaryotes as well as in viruses. 24 The crystal structure of S. cerevisiae Abd1 itself could not be determined, but eventually it was solved for its homolog, the Ecm1 protein from E. cuniculi (Fig. 2) . 25 Purified Ecm1 is a monomeric protein that catalyzes methyl transfer to GpppRNA to form cap0, but also to free mononucleotides GTP, GDP or dGTP (deoxy-GTP). The methyltransferase domain in Ecm1, and by inference also in other homologous cap0 methyltransferases, exhibits the RFM fold with a characteristic insertion that forms a characteristic b-meander structure involved in the formation of the capbinding site. This insertion is common between methyltransferases that methylate G to m 7 G in the RNA cap, and methyltransferases that N-methylate the amino acid glycine. This relationship between 2 different types of methyltransferases, as well as the cap0 methyltransferase structure, were correctly predicted using bioinformatics 24 before the first structure of the cap0 methyltransferase was determined.",

RNMT also has an N-terminal domain that is conserved in mammals, but not required for catalytic activity. However, it contains 2 nuclear localization signal motifs and the nuclear localization of RNMT is essential for cell viability. The cap0 methyltransferases, members of the abovementioned family, were also identified and chartacterized in other eukaryotes, including TbCmt1 in Trypanosoma brucei, for example. 27 As mentioned above, the viral cap0 methyltransferases possess a catalytic domain that is closely related to the eukaryotic cap0 methyltransferases, but it often functions in the context of other domains. For instance, the vaccinia virus possesses an enzyme that is composed of D1 and D12 polypeptides that execute all 3 steps in cap0 biosynthesis. The D1 subunit contains triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase activities in the N-terminal domain, and a cap0 methyltransferase domain that forms a heterodimer with the D12 subunit. 28, 29 The methyltransferase active site is located entirely in the D1 subunit and has a weak cap0 modification activity that is stimulated allosterically by D12. [30] [31] [32] Interestingly, the D12 structure resembles a degenerate cap 2 0 -O-ribose methyltransferase domain (see below), but it lacks a proper SAM binding site and does not show any methyltransferase activity on its own. 33 In the SARS-coronavirus, a nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) was initially identified as an exoribonuclease (and termed ExoN). Later, it was shown that it also exhibits cap0 methyltransferase activity. Analysis of protein variants with substitutions of conserved residues in the ExoN (N-terminal) and methyltransferase (C-terminal) domains revealed that both active sites are functionally distinct; however, the integrity of the ExoN domain turned out to be essential for the function of the cap0 methyltransferase domain. 34 Nsp14 shows little sequence similarity to known methyltransferases; however, its structure has not been determined experimentally, hence its phylogenetic relationships to other enzymes remain unclear.",

Interestingly, while the cofactor-binding sites, active sites, and the sites of binding of the nascent RNA chain exhibits similarities with the VP39 and CMTr1 enzymes (and likewise the conformations of the respective ligands), their cap-binding sites exhibit large differences in the shape of the m 7 G-binding pocket. As a result, CMTr1 binds m 7 G in a different way, in which the sugar edge of the cap guanosine faces the protein, and the methyl group on N7 faces the solvent (Fig. 3) . These structural differences explain why CMTr1 is relatively insensitive to the absence of cap0 methylation and therefore is able to act, at least in vitro, on substrates with unmethylated guanosine. Proteins with cap1 methyltransferase activities were also characterized in the alfalfa looper moth Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus (orf69 40 ) and in T. brucei (TbMTr1 41, 42 ).

            "text": "In the SARS virus, cap1 methylation is catalyzed by a complex comprised of 2 partners: the nsp16 protein that is clearly related to the above-mentioned cap1 methyltransferases, but is inactive on its own, and a small regulatory protein nsp10 that is required for nsp16 to bind both the SAM methyl group donor and the RNA substrate. The crystal structure of the snp10-nsp16 complex showed that, in nsp16, the SAM-binding region is partially degenerated compared to \"partner-independent\" ribose methyltransferases, and nsp10 stabilizes the SAM binding pocket and extends the RNA-binding groove of nsp16. 43 Apart from the enzymes responsible for cap1 methylation, methyltransferases have been characterized that act on additional residues in the nascent RNA chain. Many eukaryotic organisms possess a 2 0 -O-ribose methyltransferase that methylates the 2 nd residue in mRNA and in other RNA molecules. The cap2 methyltransferase has been characterized in T. brucei (TbMTr2 44, 45 ) and in humans (CMTr2 46 ). Interestingly, while CMTr2 appears to be closely related to its human paralog CMTr1 as well as to TbMTr1, TbMTr2 is more closely related to the vaccinia virus cap1 methyltransferase. 44 In trypanosomes, a third 2 0 -O-ribose cap methyltransferase was identified and termed TbMTr3, which is responsible for the methylation of the third residue of the cap and is required for the methylation of the fourth residue. 47, 48 TbMTr3 is a close relative of TbMTr2 and of VP39, and is only remotely related to other eukaryotic cap 2 0 -O-ribose methyltransferases, which suggests that trypanosomes acquired enzymes for \"additional\" methylation by adapting proteins from viruses. A phylogenetic study of 2 0 -O-ribose methyltransferases revealed that the relationships between cellular and viral enzymes are quite complex, and that these proteins can vary greatly in number even in closely-related organisms. Furthermore, alveolate species were identified that possessed as many as 4 2 0 -O-ribose methyltransferases, suggesting that certain enzymes of this group may act with different substrate specificities or that new cap structures with additional methylation sites remain to be discovered. 46 Proteins with cap0 and cap1 methyltransferase activities A number of viral proteins were reported to possess both cap0 and cap1 methyltransferase activities. In most of them, this is due to the presence of multiple domains. For instance, in the human reovirus (a virus with a dsRNA genome), the cap structure formation is catalyzed by a large multidomain protein lambda 2, which in turn is a part of the reovirus core: an assembly with a relative molecular mass of 52 MDa that synthesizes, modifies and exports viral mRNA. The structure of the human reovirus core has been solved at low resolution, revealing a series of domains that include a putative guanylyltransferase domain and 2 putative methyltransferase (RFM) domains. 49 It has been suggested that the order of the domains in the lambda 2 protein corresponds to the order of the capping reactions: guanosine transfer followed by cap0 and cap1 methylation. However, comparison of domain structures suggested that the functional assignments may be different, as the RFM domain 1 shared a putative active site with the corresponding structurally characterized 2 0 -O-ribose methyltransferases, including the cap1 methyltransferase, whereas the RFM domain 2 exhibited structural similarity to the cap0 methyltransferases. 50 It should be noted that the putative cap1 methyltransferase domain of reovirus exhibits a similar cap-binding platform formed by N-and C-terminal extensions, as in VP39 and human CMTr1 enzymes; however, its putative m 7 G-binding site is more open.",

The inserted RFM domain exhibited clear similarities to the cap1 methyltransferases and in 3 crystal forms had GpppG, m 7 GDP, or GTP bound in the position of the cap-binding site, while the other RFM domain exhibited low but significant similarity to known cap0 methyltransferase structures. 51 In the non-segmented, negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses [order Mononegavirales (MNV)] that include pathogens such as respiratory syncytial virus, measles, mumps, rabies, parainfluenza, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and Marburg and Ebola viruses, one of the common components of the viral ribonucleoprotein core is the large (L) protein, which encodes multiple functions such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and activities responsible for mRNA capping, cap0 and cap1 methylation, poly(A) polymerase and protein kinase. 52, 53 Using bioinformatics methods, we and others predicted that the C-terminal region of that protein (conserved region VI) encodes a domain homologous to 2 0 -O-ribose methyltransferases and is likely to function as a cap1 methyltransferase. 54, 55 Later it was found that, in VSV, this region is essential not only for cap1, but also for cap0 methyltransferase activity and that the same SAM-binding site and part of the K-D-K triad is used for both reactions. 15, 56 The structural basis of this phenomenon remains to be determined.",

In a non-structural protein 5, the N-terminus was first unambiguously characterized as a cap1 (2 0 -O-ribose) methyltransferase. Later, it was shown that this domain takes part also in cap0 (m 7 G) methylation using the same SAM-binding site during cap synthesis. 57, 58 Interestingly, in these viruses, the order of methylation is different than in Mononegavirales, as cap0 methylation precedes cap1 methylation. Several structures were determined for the flavivirus cap methyltransferases known or predicted to be bifunctional, including Dengue, 59 West Nile, 60 Wesselbron, 61 Meaban, 62 and Murray Valley encephalitis 63 viruses and they all revealed high similarity to the cap1 methyltransferases, and little if any similarity to the classical cap0 methyltransferases. It should be noted that these methyltransferases share a similar cap-binding platform structure with VP39 and human CMTr1 enzymes (a platform formed by N-and C-terminal extensions); however, the orientation of the bound guanosine residue suggests that their mode of cap-recognition is different from both poxvirus and human enzymes (Fig. 3) .",

Bioinformatics analyses predicted that the Tgs enzymes are related to a large group of RFM enzymes that act on exocyclic amine groups in nucleic acid bases, including m 6 A, m 4 C, and m 2 G and have a characteristic NPPY-like motif at the active site. 66 The crystal structure of the active C-terminal methyltransferase domain of the human TGS enzyme bound to a minimal substrate m 7 GTP as well as the reaction product SAH has been reported, confirming these predictions and revealing the atomic details of these protein-ligand interactions. 69, 70 Other methyltransferases involved in cap-specific base modifications",

In this context, the difference between the structures of the human enzymes and the enzymes from human pathogens could be exploited to develop new drugs.

[78] [79] [80] [81] The development of compounds that specifically inhibit viral methyltransferases will be aided by the recent structure determination of the catalytic domain of the human cap1 methyltransferase, which shares the global architecture, but exhibits a different cap-binding site compared to the viral enzymes. 39 The human cap1 methyltransferase appears to be essential and cannot be knocked out in human cells (our unpublished data), therefore the development of inhibitors specific against that human enzyme could be also useful as tools to study the cellular function of cap1 methylation.",

While the analysis of protein-RNA interactions and search for potential regulatory molecules (e.g., inhibitors) could be guided by homology models developed so far, 47 experimental determination of high resolution structures for cap methyltransferases in trypanosomes would be definitely useful.",
