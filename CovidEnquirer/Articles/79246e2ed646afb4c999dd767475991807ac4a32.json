We give examples of the Cavbase similarity analysis detecting pronounced similarities in the binding sites of proteins unrelated in sequence. A similarity search using SARS M pro protease subpockets as queries retrieved ligands and ligand fragments accommodated in a physicochemical environment similar to that of the query. This allowed the characterization of the protease recognition pockets and the identification of molecular building blocks that can be incorporated into novel antiviral compounds. A cluster analysis procedure for the functional classification of binding pockets was implemented and calibrated using a diverse set of enzyme binding sites. Two relevant protein families, the a-carbonic anhydrases and the protein kinases, are used to demonstrate the scope of our cluster approach. We propose a relevant classification of both protein families, on the basis of the binding motifs in their active sites. The classification provides a new perspective on functional properties across a protein family and is able to highlight features important for potency and selectivity. Furthermore, this information can be used to identify possible cross-reactivities among proteins due to similarities in their binding sites.",

            "text": "Protein function, in particular that of enzymes, is often intimately connected with the recognition and chemical modification of endogenous ligands, such as agonists, antagonists, effectors and substrates. This recognition usually occurs in well-characterized cavities or binding sites on the protein surface. Due to the functional importance of protein binding sites, there are several important applications of their similarity analysis: (i) several studies have demonstrated that there is not necessarily a correlation between the fold and function of proteins. [1] [2] [3] [4] Accordingly, similarity analysis of binding sites can complement methods based only on information about sequence and fold in the functional annotation of protein structures. (ii) With respect to the development of novel leads, the knowledge about ligands and ligand fragments that bind to structurally and physicochemically similar (sub-) pockets in other proteins can provide important ideas for drug discovery, in particular with respect to de novo design or the bioisosteric replacements of molecular building blocks. (iii) We showed recently that binding site similarities detected between unrelated proteins can help to rationalize and predict cross-reactivities. 5 Different proteins with similarities in their binding site recognition properties may bind the same drugs. (iv) Furthermore, a classification of proteins based on the similarities between their active sites can be derived. This alternative taxonomy provides another perspective on the protein space and possibly highlights relationships between proteins, including conformational adaptations, that might not be apparent using the well-established comparative tools.",

            "text": "There are several methods published in the literature that compare protein structures and detect common patterns between them. These methods can be divided into two categories: methods based on predefined common threedimensional templates comprised of several amino acids, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] and methods that operate independently of any reference template, mutually comparing entire protein structures or predefined regions of interest. Template-based methods usually represent the amino acids by several pseudo-atoms that encode the properties of the amino acids. Based on these descriptors, they are able to retrieve protein structures exhibiting similar patterns. However, the search results will be biased, to some extent, by the choice of predefined query template. Methods that use the entire protein structure or a predefined portion can range from simple (e.g. C a coordinates) to rather complex descriptors such as Connolly surface points containing geometric information (surface shape descriptors) or physicochemical information (amino acid type, hydrophobicity, electrostatic potential). To identify common substructures between assigned descriptors, different algorithms such as geometric hashing, 8, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] genetic algorithms, 27, 28 graph matching algorithms, 6, 7, 25, 26, [29] [30] [31] string matching, 23, 24 and searches in multi-index structures 10 have been used.",

A clique algorithm detects similar arrangements of pseudocenters between two cavities. Here, we present the optimization of the physicochemical representation of a binding pocket validated against experimental data using an improved set of pseudocenter definitions, we retrieved further examples showing structurally and functionally related cavities independent of fold and sequence homology. A similarity search based on the individual subpockets of SARS M pro protease is used to demonstrate the scope of Cavbase to characterize protein binding pockets with respect to bound ligands and ligand fragments. Once appropriate ligand fragments are detected in subpockets of similar proteins, their geometry may serve as guidelines for further inhibitor design. All of the above-mentioned methods for comparing protein structures focus on the comparison of selected binding pockets or query patterns against a database of protein binding sites. Here, we extend the mutual similarity analysis by clustering a sample of protein cavities to discover relationships between binding sites of protein families. Such criteria will be used to differentiate between protein families and, at the same time, to detect similarities among entries originating from the same protein family. To achieve such a classification, a clustering procedure was implemented and optimized. Finally, the classification of two pharmaceutically relevant protein families, the a-carbonic anhydrases and the eukaryotic protein kinases, in terms of the Cavbase taxonomy are presented.",

This information was evaluated to derive the definitions of the pseudocenter positions, during the design of Cavbase. 32 Since a stringent pseudocenter definition allowing for fast binding site comparisons should be achieved, the properties of some residues were not described in full detail in our first implementation. Therefore, we have reassigned the pseudocenter definitions in a more elaborate fashion. For example, the hydrogen bonding properties of cysteine were not considered; nevertheless, the sulfhydryl group can be involved in hydrogen bonding. McDonald and co-workers found that cysteine rarely serves as hydrogen-bond acceptor but often acts as hydrogenbond donor. 36 Furthermore, cysteine is often found as a catalytically relevant residue in protein active sites. 37 To account for its hydrogen bonding ability, a donor center was added at the sulfur atom of cysteine ( Figure 1 ). In the case of methionine, there seems to be no significant involvement of the sulfur atom in hydrogen bonding. Accordingly, its side-chain remains represented by one aliphatic pseudocenter only .",

Therefore, two cut-off values were introduced, depending on the origin of the pi pseudocenter.

It is relatively large and encompasses, besides NADH, a binding site for UDP-galactose. The epimerase catalyzes the conversion of UDP-galactose to UDP-glucose, simultaneously reducing NAD C . The product UDP-glucose is bound together with NADH in the query structure. As expected, binding sites hosting NADH were found amongst the most highly scored cavities. The similarity across the entire cofactor-binding site is quite pronounced, since the same amino acids are involved in cofactor coordination and little structural variation is observed.

It is caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV), the SARS CoV. 49, 50 The virus secretes the protease M pro (3C-like, 3CL), which exhibits an important function in the viral life-cycle. 51 Its inhibition provides a promising therapeutic principle for the development of anti-viral drugs against SARS. The folding pattern of the CoV M pro is related to the fold of serine proteases (chymotrypsin type), 52,53 which consist of two domains (I and II). Additionally, the SARS CoV M pro exhibits a third helical domain. The binding pocket at the interface between domain I and domain II, comprising the residues of the catalytic dyad (His45 and Cys145), is detected by Ligsite. This pocket has been used for a subsequent similarity search with Cavbase against dataset I. In the reference crystal structure of SARS-CoV, a peptidic inhibitor (1) (PDB code 1uk4) 54 is bound. Cavbase retrieves the human homologues of SARS CoV M pro , which are most highly ranked, followed by other viral proteases such as human CoV, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and the tobacco etch virus. Interestingly, the rhinovirus 3C protease with the bound inhibitor AG7088 (2) is found at rank 13. 55, 56 In Figure 5 , the superposition of the SARS CoV M pro and the latter rhinoviral protease is shown. The residues comprising the catalytic site and the main-chain substrate recognition site are detected as similar in the two pockets. Analogous side-chains of both inhibitors address Figure 3 . Consideration of edge-to-face interactions of aromatic moieties in the Cavbase binding site description and similarity searches. The binding pocket of a hydrolase (PDB code 1tum) is used to demonstrate the influence of different parameter settings for pseudocenters describing hydrophobic aromatic interactions, with respect to their exposure onto the protein surface (color coding as in Figure 2 ). Two phenylalanine residues (carbon atoms colored orange) can potentially perform edge-to-face interactions towards the cavity surface. Using the original angular parameter settings (left), no interaction towards the cavity surface would be considered for either ring (violet areas). Recalibrating the angle between the standard vector r and the mean orientation vector v to 1008 (right) allows the recognition of edge-to-face interactions, and both pi pseudocenters can now expose their property onto the cavity surface (orange areas).",

The S1 subpocket exhibits a stronger polar character, whereas the S2 subpocket exhibits an aliphatic-aromatic character. \u2021 The protein kinases from the serine/threonine (2.7.1.37) and the tyrosine subfamily (2.7.1.112) are regarded as one enzyme family. therefore, similarities in sequence and in the folding pattern are found across the family members. Each protein entry was checked carefully to include only the \"catalytic\" cavity into the dataset; i.e. the cavities comprising the known catalytic residues. The Cavbase similarity scores do not obey the prerequisites for an optimal similarity metric, which requires reflexivity (cavity A is similar to itself), symmetry (if cavity A is similar to cavity B, then cavity B is similar to cavity A), and transitivity (if cavity A is similar to B and cavity B is similar to cavity C, then cavity A is also similar to cavity C). Therefore, their suitability for a cluster analysis should be investigated. Whereas the first two properties are met, the transitive term is not necessarily met. In total, 12 different combinations of algorithms and scoring functions (four clustering algorithms together with three Cavbase scoring functions) were systematically evaluated as setup for clustering. One crucial parameter in clustering is the definition of the number of predefined output clusters. This value defines the level of detail to which the clustering process will analyze the data. A low number of clusters will merge dissimilar cavities into one cluster, whereas too large a number will likely obscure the detection of patterns in a dataset, and lead to the generation of many singletons.

A cluster analysis based on sequence similarities, with 13 clusters, reveals clear separation of the 13 protein families (data not shown). In sequence space, this result appears self-evident; however, a high level of sequence similarity is not necessarily accompanied by a high level of structural similarity of binding sites.

The latter method tends to produce one very large cluster comprised of cavities from different protein families if the number of output clusters used is too low.

The clusters (along the diagonal from the bottom-left to the top-right) consist of cavities extracted from the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP) of the p38a (cluster A) and Erk2 (cluster B), cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) and src kinase (cluster C), the fibroblast growth factor receptor kinases and tyrosine kinases (cluster D), the serine/threonine kinase subfamily (cluster E), and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase subfamily (cluster F) ( Figure 11 ). Cavbase is able to separate the different kinase subfamilies automatically, notably considering structural information about the kinase binding sites only, and not about the entire proteins.",

            "text": "The Cavbase analysis helps to establish relationships between different protein kinase families in terms of binding site regions that are common and those that differ between families. For example, similarities among the MAP kinase cavities from the Erk2 and p38a subfamilies are detected convincingly. However, differences are also well captured. Figure 12 shows a superposition of two different MAP Erk2 kinase cavities and of a MAP Erk2 and MAP p38-a cavity. The two Erk2 kinases exhibit a high level of similarity. The areas detected as similar comprise almost the entire cavities, including the ATP-binding pockets, and extend towards the activation loop. In contrast, the similarity between the Erk2 and p38-a structures is substantially smaller and limited to the adenine-binding region. In particular, areas next to the hinge-binding region are found to be similar. They are addressed by recurring hydrogen bonding motifs in smallmolecule inhibitors targeting the ATP pocket. Accordingly, the Cavbase analysis intuitively helps to locate the selectivity-discriminating regions among binding pockets from related proteins. Of particular interest in this respect are spatial similarities across binding pockets that reside in proteins with low levels of sequence identity. The criteria for comparison in Cavbase focus on the spatial arrangement of physicochemical properties, and not on the actual amino acids along the polypeptide chain. For example, the cavities of two cAMP-dependent kinases (1cdk and 1atp) from pig and mouse are more distinct in sequence space than in cavity space ( Figure 11 ); in the latter they are closely related. The phosphorylase kinase (1phk) shares only a low degree of sequence identity with the cAMPdependent kinases (w23%). Interestingly, in cavity space its binding pocket shows pronounced similarity to the cAMP-dependent kinases ( Figure 13 ). Furthermore, it shows similarities to the sequentially unrelated casein kinase (1csn). Figure 11 . Cavbase clustering for a kinase dataset of 30 cavities (see Figure 8 ). The R 1 scoring function and the rb clustering algorithm were used to generate six distinct clusters. Cavbase differentiates between the 30 kinases at the subfamily level.

            "text": "Here, we present important algorithmic and methodological enhancements of Cavbase. The approach compares and classifies proteins in terms of binding-site exposed physicochemical properties responsible for the recognition of potentially bound ligands. For this purpose, Cavbase assigns to all binding-site residues pseudocenters that encode the recognition properties of the residue's functional groups in the binding pocket. Furthermore, surface patches are assigned to the pseudocenters to measure their accessibility by potentially bound ligands. The quality of the attempted binding pocket comparison in Cavbase relies highly on the completeness, relevance and reliability of the spatial placement of the pseudocenters. To enhance this description, pi pseudocenters representing p interactions putatively performed by the amino acids containing terminal carboxy, carboxamide, and guanidino groups were introduced. Furthermore, the hydrogen bond donor capabilities of cysteine are now considered. In order to account for the edge-to-face interactions of aromatic moieties, the angular parameters for the exposure of pi centers were adjusted. Enhancements to the clique algorithm for the binding site comparisons resulted in a significant reduction of the time needed for binding site analysis, thereby facilitating large-scale comparisons of binding pockets. Additional examples of the discovery of functional similarity of proteins, despite low levels of sequence and fold homology, are presented. In a case study, the potential of Cavbase as a design tool has been demonstrated. Antiviral leads targeting the SARS cysteine protease have been assembled on the basis of the results of a Cavbase similarity search using the individual subpockets of the target protease as input query. Interesting hits are suggested as putative occupants of the protease subpockets. The retrieval of ligands and ligand fragments bound in a similar physicochemical environment permits a better characterization of the SARS protease recognition pockets. Compounds that were selected using this information and subsequently synthesized showed micromolar inhibition of the protease. 84 Furthermore, it is demonstrated here that Cavbase provides a novel taxonomy to classify proteins. A selected set of cavities is clustered in terms of their mutual cavity similarity. A clustering Figure 12 . Superposition of MAP kinase binding sites. On the left, a superposition of two Erk2 kinases (PDB code 1erk and 1gol) is shown. Large portions of the binding sites are recognized as being similar. On the right, a superposition of an Erk2 kinase (PDB code 3erk, carbon atoms colored gray) and a MAP p38a kinase (PDB code 1bl7, carbon atoms colored yellow) is displayed. In both pictures, the matching pseudocenters and the hinge backbone protein atoms are displayed (color coding as in Figure 2 ). Based on the similar hinge binding region, Cavbase superimposes both inhibitors convincingly. In both cases, the hinge coordination via the hydrogen bond from the pyrimidine nitrogen atom of the inhibitor to Asp104 (Erk2) and His107 (p38a) is detected. Figure 13 . Superposition of phosphorylase kinase (PDB code 1phk) and cAMP-dependent kinase (PDB code 1atp). The matching pseudocenters and bound ATP molecules are displayed (color coding as in Figure 2 ). The two cavities show extensive similarities in the entire ATP binding pocket, comprising areas next to the hinge region and the adenosine binding site, as well as the DFG motif and parts of the activation loop. procedure that allows for the fast and automatic classification of large datasets has been implemented. Using a test set of various enzyme structures, optimal settings for clustering could be determined. Cavbase clustering reveals a reliable separation of various dataset entries into individual clusters representing different protein families. The novel technique is applied to two pharmaceutically relevant protein families: the a-carbonic anhydrases and the eukaryotic protein kinases. Cavbase distinguishes successfully between different protein subfamilies and produces a meaningful clustering. In the case of the CAs, Cavbase achieves full separation into single subfamilies. Manually analyzing the indicated relationships across the CA subfamilies elucidates clustering in terms of conformational states and mutational differences. The classification of the protein kinases also resulted in a clear differentiation between the distinct kinase subfamilies. Furthermore, Cavbase succeeds in separating kinase subfamily structures into distinct activation states. This again emphasizes the sensitivity of our approach towards conformational differences among binding pockets. Relationships between kinase subfamilies, such as the Erk2 and p38a subfamilies of the MAP kinases, could be established; regions of the binding sites that are common to the different subfamily cavities, and regions where the essential features differ, are identified. The detection of structurally similar areas of the binding sites of sequentially unrelated kinases helps to identify examples where crossreactivity due to these structural similarities could be expected.",

For the remaining points, the degree of burial in the protein binding pocket is determined, and neighboring grid points with a high degree of burial are merged together to form contiguous cavities, following the procedure described by Schmitt et al. 32 All surfacecontacting grid points of such a cluster, apart from the non-buried ones oriented towards the solvent, are used to approximate the cavity surface.

In principle, Cavbase can perform such comparisons. However, even though a mutual comparison of two binding cavities is easy to compute, a large-scale comparison across huge cavity datasets will be very demanding and hardly feasible. A clique algorithm is applied to detect common substructures between two cavities. 77 The clique algorithm operates on the product graph P, which has to be constructed beforehand. A node (u,v), consisting of a pair of pseudocenters from two binding sites, is inserted into P if the two pseudocenters have comparable labels (pseudocenter types). 32 Two nodes (u,v) and (u 0 ,v 0 ) in P are connected if the corresponding pseudocenter pairs fulfill the following conditions: A predefined number (default 100) of the largest clique solutions is accepted and further evaluated by scoring them according to the degree of spatial overlap between corresponding cavity surface patches. The following scoring procedure is applied to every accepted clique solution: The two binding sites are superimposed based on the matching pseudocenters found in the clique detection (Table 6 ). In addition to the matching pseudocenters detected in the clique detection, every pseudocenter pair assigned to the same physicochemical property is analyzed in terms of the surface patch overlap. This is done to potentially improve the initial clique solutions. The surface patch overlap for each pseudocenter pair is calculated by summing the relative frequency of surface grid points of both surface patches that fall next to each other below a distance threshold of 1.0 \u00c5 . A match is considered to contribute to the overall binding site similarity only if at least 70% of the surface points of the matching surface patches are shared in common, to avoid the consideration of strongly fragmented surface patches. The R 1 scoring value for the comparison of two binding sites is calculated by summing all surface patch overlap values of the pseudocenter pairs that pass the overlap criterion. These pseudocenters represent the physicochemical properties shared by both cavities. Only the most highly scored clique solution is considered further. 32 Approximately 80% of the computational effort in a binding site comparison is spent on the scoring process. Accordingly, we sought to accelerate the evaluation of the degree of overlap of two surface patches. Since the surface patch overlap is determined for all pseudocenter pairs assigned to the same type, it is even determined if both patches are very distant from each other and cannot be superimposed fulfilling the criteria mentioned above. Obviously, this is the case if the distance between the corresponding pseudocenters is too large; these comparisons have to be avoided. Therefore, only the surface patches corresponding to pseudocenters that fall within 4 \u00c5 of each other are considered further. Using these heuristics, the speed of a binding site comparison could be enhanced 40-fold.",

For each one-to-one comparison, Cavbase returns three similarity scores, according to the three schemes described above.

Four different clustering algorithms, as implemented in the clustering toolkit CLUTO b , were used. These consisted of two partitional (rb and rbr), one agglomerative (agglo), and one graph-partitioning (graph) method. The rb and rbr methods split the dataset into two groups. These groups are then repeatedly split further, until a predefined number of output clusters is obtained. The rbr method incorporates, in addition to the procedure of the rb method, a final global optimization step. The agglo method initially regards each single object as an individual cluster (\"singleton\"), and sequentially merges the two most similar clusters into a new cluster. The similarity of the newly created cluster with respect to all the others is calculated using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) approach, which evaluates the distance between two clusters by averaging over the similarities of all the pairs of objects that can be formed between the two clusters. In the graph method, the objects are described as nodes of a graph. Nodes are connected if they are nearest neighbors. During clustering the graph is dissected into subgraphs, whilst attempting to minimize the number of edges that are broken. In combination with the different clustering algorithms, agglomerative merging schemes can be applied to obtain a hierarchical tree structure for the different clustering solutions. This allows for an intuitive navigation through the clustered solutions and supports the detection of relationships. All methods were used with the default settings provided by CLUTO.",

A comparison of the Drugscore hotspots with the Cavbase binding site description is shown for the binding pocket of dihydro-orotatedehydrogenase (PDB code 1d3h). In (I) the Cavbase surface patches, annotated with respect to the five physicochemical properties of the neighboring pseudocenters, are shown as dotted surfaces (color scheme used: H bond donor (blue), H bond acceptor (red), ambivalent donor/acceptor (green), hydrophobic aliphatic (white) or aromatic/pi (orange)). (II) to (IV) display three types of Drugscore hotspots, together with the Cavbase surface. The color coding of the hotspots corresponds to that of the related Cavbase properties (Drugscore atom type N.3 (red, II), O.2 (blue, III) and C.ar (orange, IV)). Drugscore hotspots that describe directional interactions match very well with the corresponding Cavbase surface patches. The contour levels are calibrated for each atom type in such a way that 0.6% of the grid points are assigned to the most favorable interaction areas.",

The nucleotide cofactor binding sites in UDP-galactose-4-epimerase (PDB code 1xel, grey carbon atoms) and acyl-CoA-dehydrogenase (PDB code 1e6w, yellow carbon atoms) detected as similar by Cavbase. The NADH binding is performed by virtually identical amino acids. In (I), the matching pseudocenters (color coding as in Figure 2) in both binding pockets are shown, together with NADH. In (II), the matching amino acids are displayed in addition, suggesting pronounced structural conservation between the two binding sites. The comparison of the UDP galactose with a glucose oxidase (PDB code 1gal, yellow carbon atoms) reveals a case where the nucleotide cofactor binding is performed by entirely different amino acids, although their physicochemical interactions are similar, and this is detected by Cavbase. The matching pseudocenters and cofactors (NADH (1xel) and FAD (1gal)) in the two binding sites are shown in (III). In (IV), the amino acids superimposed on the matched pseudocenters, are displayed.",

Mutual similarities are expressed by the intensity of the red color (see Figure 8). The different scoring schemes produce consistent results and suggest a reasonable clustering. In (IV), the clustering based on the agglo algorithm, in combination with scoring scheme R 1 , is shown. It tends to produce several singletons early and seems to merge many entries into one large cluster. By predefining a larger number of clusters, this large cluster would be decomposed into several smaller clusters.",
