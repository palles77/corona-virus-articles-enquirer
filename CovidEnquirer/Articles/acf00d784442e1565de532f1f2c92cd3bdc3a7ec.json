Multiple investigations and studies were conducted in an attempt to answer questions about the epidemic; at the top of the list were how the virus arrived in the United States and if there was risk of another disease following the same path.",

The group's objective was to identify the mechanism or most likely mechanisms by which PED reached the United States and infected U.S. pigs. The RCG reviewed literature; evaluated data from research projects; consulted with swine industry and veterinary specialists familiar with the individual outbreaks; collaborated with U.S. Government partners; reviewed reports published on university, industry, and laboratory websites; examined U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data on imported products; evaluated data from prohibited product seizures at U.S. ports; and collated testing data from affected herds. Additionally, the RCG initiated new studies as indicated, analyzed data, and conducted follow-up investigations of early-affected farms, and also reached out to international partners that had experienced outbreaks of novel swine enteric coronavirus diseases.",

The RCG used the conclusions of this report and results of published research studies as a baseline, and followed with an epidemiological approach to narrow the scope and more specifically address the entry of PED virus into the United States. The group applied basic concepts of host, agent, environment, and evaluation of transmission mechanisms to develop scenarios that could explain the epidemic. National epidemic curves and timelines were developed to plot the course of the disease spread. Individual herd data gathered by first-responding veterinarians, and later augmented by revisits by VS officers to farms provided vital information for limiting the number of likely disease introduction mechanisms. Host factors, such as a na\u00efve swine population with an explosive spread of disease, helped to limit the probable time of first introduction. Data from genetic epidemiology, virus survival, and infectious dose studies further narrowed the possibilities. Fig. 1 describes five criteria the RCG considered essential for a scenario to explain PED virus entry to the country.",

Affected farms used different brands of feed from different source companies. There were no common veterinarians, and the herds were owned by different companies. The age and production types of the pigs were different between cases, as were ration formulations. Most of the farms employed good if not best practices for biosecurity; in several cases, they were farms that had been able to exclude endemic contagious viruses such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). There was no single brand or type of biological or vaccine that was used in the different farms. No farm reported visitors from other countries or suspicious activities that suggested an intentional infection of their pigs. The farms were not associated geographically and were not proximate to research or laboratory facilities. Semen came from different sources, all within the United States. None of the herds that were reported through laboratory testing data in the first month of the outbreak were small herds; i.e., all affected herds were of size greater than 1000 animals. Operations with less than 1000 head compose approximately 80% of all U.S. swine operations (USDA-NASS, 2012), and small farms in general have been shown less likely to have stringent biosecurity practices (USDA-APHIS-VS-CEAH, 2012). Although possible that small farms may use veterinary or diagnostic services and report less frequently than larger commercial farms, smaller farms may not have been affected because of different management practices such as receiving feed in bulk quantities. Of the consultants interviewed, three believed the virus introduction was associated with feed, one thought it unlikely that PED virus would remain viable for the length of time required for transit to the United States in feed, and others believed feed as a possibility but were non-committal as to mechanisms. Other alternatives varied widely between experts.",

The samples, archived in 2012 and 2013, were found negative for PED virus RNA (personal communication, approximately 800 samples).

Prior the U.S. Federal Order of June 5 2014, laboratories submitting test results did not identify whether the result was for a herd or accession. The group assumed that the shape of the epidemic curve would not vary significantly due to those accessions that could have represented more than a single herd. The customs import data provide very limited description of products through a Harmonized Tariff Code and a brief product description (e.g., \"SOYBEANS W/N BROKEN, ORGANIC\"). Importer and consignee data represent the port of origin and destination but do not identify the final disposition of a product, and the possibility exists for misidentification of products. Recognizing potential limitations, the Root Cause investigators met with APHIS port inspectors and data managers to help clarify questions about the customs data definitions and inspection processes. Information from farm visits and interviews were subject to recall bias because the outbreak began 15-18 months earlier than the investigation. Some farms had records of ration components, invoices, and deliveries while others had partial records or recollection available. Although no single data source could supply definitive answers, the aggregated information led to several possible scenarios to explain the source of the outbreak.",

Evaluation of the processing and biosecurity practices of the treat manufacturers was reported by FDA, and the inspection reports describe sanitary conditions and processes in the manufacturing plants (FDA-CVM, 2012a,b) . Viruses are unlikely to remain viable through cooking, but post-cooking biosecurity between cooked and raw product as described in the FDA reports may not be adequate to prevent cross-contamination with the highly contagious PED virus. Pre-shipping procedures include a voluntary cold sterilization irradiation process, which appears be effective against bacterial contaminants, but would not be not adequate to prevent virus carriage. It is unknown whether pet treats in the United States are repurposed and incorporated with other pet food into swine rations, but if so, repurposed pet food is transported in FIBCs and may provide opportunity for virus movement (VS field officers-personal communication). Incorporation of pet food or pet treats is uncommon in swine rations in either Fig. 7 . FIBC \"totes\" are reusable, tough, versatile bags made to transport many bulk products but are not specifically designed to exclude environmental contaminants that could harbor viruses. They are commercially available for purchase from many retailers worldwide. This image shows totes containing fertilizer under a tree in an open field.

The United States is a major soybean exporter, but due to high demand for organically grown and non-genetically modified organism (GMO) beans, the United States imports organic soybeans from several countries including China. For the period in 2013 between January 1st and April 15th, imports from China totaled approximately 31,000 metric tons of soybean and 1000 tons of soy flours (CBP import data). The soybeans are frequently transported to the United States in FIBCs. Since the first PED virus herds detected were not organic farms, transmission of virus would have to occur via an intermediate fomite such as reused FIBCs. After a contaminated product is removed, the FIBC would remain contaminated, and its reuse would potentially transmit virus to the next product it contained. The second product or the container would then arrive at a feed mill or farm to infect pigs.",

The samples were collected opportunistically from various locations in Iowa, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, and Hawaii. Although considerable uncertainty exists in estimating feral pig population numbers, six post-hoc groups of pigs were identified by VS and WS biologists.

Many were ruled as unlikely because investigation data from the earliest detected herds did not support them or were considered less likely because of other data. Evaluation of the entire set of information required a number of assumptions for these scenarios to be feasible. Birds were considered unlikely because none of the herds had exposure to migratory birds, and no evidence has been reported that the current strains of SEC viruses can cross species to infect birds then back to pigs again. Different sources of semen, supplies, and biologicals were reported between the farms, and none of the operations were located proximate to research facilities or laboratories. Although some were fed antibiotic products, others were not. Further, the plant material fillers like rice hulls are very dry and likely not hospitable to virus stability. SDPP was used in some rations but not in others, and is a prohibited import from China.

The viruses must have been carried through four segments of the journey: contamination in the country of origin, entry to the United States, dispersion to multiple locations, and exposure and infection of pigs. The FIBC scenario explains a mechanism for each and is compatible with findings of herd investigations as well as other information gathered with few assumptions. It is plausible that pet treats entered the United States contaminated by PED virus, but unlikely that they infected pigs without a secondary fomite such as the FIBCs and unknown if they were ever fed to pigs. Similarly, organic soybeans could be contaminated with viruses, but they too must have a secondary carrier to achieve the dispersal and exposure parts of the journey to infect pigs. The same conclusion, that a secondary fomite is necessary, exists for almost any of the plausible scenarios that the RCG investigated.",

Contamination of products in an origin country is largely out of U.S. Government regulatory control and likely outside the realm of industry management. Inspections at entry ports are vital, but visual inspections or even empirical testing would be unlikely to identify products contaminated with miniscule amounts of infectious virus. If the fomite that moved the virus was indeed the FIBC, sanitary management prior to reusing the bags may be an effective mitigation. Further research is necessary to identify appropriate cleaning and disinfection procedures and parameters, but the answer could be as simple as not reusing the bags, or a to-be-determined, protocol of dry heat or disinfection prior to reusing the containers.",

The curve suggests one or a small number introductions of PED virus followed by a rapidly propagating epidemic typical of a highly contagious disease (Smith, 1995). Fig. 5 shows a time line of the first cases that were identified. Each point on the curve represents the number of herds identified during the week, and dates are adjusted to best represent the first day that clinical signs were reported to be present. A case is defined as one or more herds in a facility or geographically associated facilities belonging to one company. The first cases show that herds in at least six separated companies became infected within approximately two weeks in geographically dispersed locations across Ohio, Indiana, and Iowa (Fig. 5). These were shortly followed by outbreaks in Colorado and Minnesota, and other states.",

As of 9/22/15, samples from 30 shipments of imported soybeans had been received with no detection of any of the assayed viruses (PEDv, PDCoV, TGE, PRRS, PCV2). 2) Testing archived pet jerky treats from China. No virus was detected from 40 samples of the imported jerky pet treats archived prior to April 2013. 3) Stability of PED virus in FIBC material. Results for survival of PED virus on FIBC material are suggestive that the FIBC scenario has merit. The woven fabric was treated with a preset amount of cultured PED virus. The virus concentrations remained stable through the 10-week time point for both the 4 \u2022 C or \u221280 \u2022 C temperatures. Viable virus was detected after five weeks but not six weeks at room temperature (Fig. 6). 4) PED virus circulation in feral swine from a set of feral swine serum samples archived prior to the PED outbreak. Although considerable uncertainty exists in estimating feral pig population numbers, six post-hoc groups of pigs were identified by VS and WS biologists. With the assumption that sampling was proportional to population size and the sampled pig units represented 25 to 90% of the population in each group, PEDV Titer (FFU/ml) Storage Time of Dried Virus (Days) PED Virus Stability on Shipping Tote Material After 10 weeks of storage, PED virus remained stable at \u221280 \u2022 C at a concentration of approximately 2 \u00d7 10 5 FFU/ml. In addition, PED virus stored at 4 \u2022 C demonstrated similar stability over time. In contrast, PEDV held at room temperature demonstrated a drop in titer of approximately 1 log per week. No viable PEDV was detected after 5 weeks of storage at room temperature.",

Infectious virus titers for each time point and temperature were presented graphically as mean fluorescent focus units (FFU)/ml. 4) Testing for evidence of PED virus circulation in feral swine. Detecting PED virus in feral swine samples archived prior to April 2013 would suggest that the initial introduction into the United States was earlier than indicated by reported test data, and that the path of introduction differed significantly than what might be expected in commercial swine. The purpose of retrospective testing of feral swine was to produce evidence to inform the hypothesis that SECD-related virus was circulating in feral swine prior to the initial detection of clinical signs in domestic swine in April 2013. Testing of the samples was conducted with an ELISA test (Whole Virus ELISA for PED virus) recently developed by ISUVDL. Initial performance testing on domestic swine indicated that the diagnostic specificity was 98.5% and the sensitivity was greater than the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) from 2 to 7 weeks post inoculation (diagnostic sensitivity point estimate 99.2%). Serum samples from 368 feral swine were provided from the Wildlife Services Wildlife Disease Program archive for fiscal years 2011-2013. The samples were collected opportunistically from various locations in Iowa, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, and Hawaii.",
