A tandem alkylation, c-lactonization, a chemoselective reduction of ester in the presence of c-lactone functional group, a RCM reaction, and a Mitsunobu coupling reaction were used as key reactions. D-Counterpart nucleosides were also prepared according to the same synthetic method. Among the synthesized carbanucleosides, D-thymine nucleoside, D-2 and L-thymine nucleoside, L-2 exhibited excellent anti-HIV-1 and -2 activities, in MT-4 cells, which were higher than those of ddI, an anti-AIDS drug. Whereas D-2 exhibited high cytotoxicity in MT-4 cell lines, L-2 did not show any discernible cytotoxicity in all cell lines tested, reflecting that L-2 may be a good candidate for an anti-AIDS drug. L-2 also showed weak anti-HSV-2 activity without cytotoxicity. However, none of the synthesized nucleosides exhibited antiviral activities against RNA viruses including coxsakie, influenza, corona and polio viruses, maybe due to their 2 0 ,3 0 -dideoxy structure. Potent antiviral effects of D-2 and L-2 indicate that nucleosides belonging to a class of D4Ns can be an excellent candidate for anti-DNA virus agents. This research strongly supports L-nucleosides of a class of D4Ns to be a very promising candidate for antiviral agents due to its low cytotoxicity and a good antiviral activity. j o u r n a l h o m e p a g e : w w w . e l s e v i e r . c o m / l o c a t e / b m c various enzymes associated with nucleoside metabolism and nucleotide polymerization. 18,19",

When nucleosides bind to the active site of enzymes, each conformer exhibits different affinity. Therefore, rigid MC nucleosides have been used to investigate the conformational preferences of 0968 was synthesized in two steps according to the procedure reported by Tsuji and co-workers. 24, 25 Reaction of (R)-epichlorohydrin with diethyl malonate and sodium metal gave cyclopropane-fused c-lactone 6 via tandem alkylation followed by lactonization. The lactone moiety of 6 might be more susceptible to hydrolysis than the ester, maybe due to the structural constraint caused by a fused cyclopropane ring. Treatment of 6 with 1 equiv of sodium hydroxide in EtOH afforded monocarboxylate sodium salt 6a, the ester of which was selectively reduced by sodium borohydride under reflux and then recyclized back to c-lactone 7 under acidic conditions. Protection of hydroxyl group of 7 with tert-butyldiphenylsilyl chloride produced silyl ether 8, which was reduced with Dibal-H at \u00c078\u00b0C to afford the corresponding lactol 9 in 97% yield. Wittig reaction of lactol 9 with methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide in the presence of potassium tert-butoxide afforded hydroxy olefin 10 in 88% yield after quenching with saturated aqueous NH 4 Cl solution. However, when the reaction mixture was partitioned between EtOAc and water without quenching with saturated NH 4 Cl aqueous solution after the Wittig reaction, a new byproduct appeared at a higher R f value than that of the desired compound 10 in 10-20% yield. It turned out to be an acetylated compound 10a by 1 H, 13 C, COSY (Correlation spectroscopy) and HMBC (Heteronuclear multiple bond correlation) NMR experiments. The acetyl group might be derived from ethyl acetate used for extraction due to basic reaction conditions. Swern oxidation of 10 with oxalyl chloride and dimethyl sulfoxide at \u00c078\u00b0C smoothly proceeded to produce aldehyde 11, which was subjected to a Grignard reaction with vinylmagnesium bromide to afford allylic alcohols 12 (48%) and 13 (39%), easily separated by normal silica gel column chromatography. The stereochemistry of 12 and 13 was not determined until the corresponding bicyclo[3.1.0]hexenol scaffold was formed via a RCM (ring-closure metathesis) reaction in the next step. RCM reaction 26 of dienes 12 and 13 with a second generation Grubbs catalyst produced the bicyclo[3.1.0]hex-3-en-2-ol analogs, (2R)-14 and (2S)-14, respectively. The stereochemistry of them was confirmed by comparing their 1 H NMR spectra with that of the authentic enantio-counterpart, an enantiomer of (2S)-14, prepared from a chiral bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane template, 27 indicating that the RCM product (2S)-14 derived from compound 13 has the desired (2S)-stereochemistry for a Mitsunobu reaction with nucleobases to yield various conformationally locked nucleo-sides. (2R)-14 can be also potential starting material for a palladium-mediated coupling reaction with nucleobases to produce the desired b-anomer.",

For the synthesis of guanine nucleoside L-5, condensation of (2S)-14 with 2-amino-6-chloropurine under Mitsunobu conditions afforded protected 2-amino-6-chloropurine nucleoside 19 (Scheme 4), which was subjected to desilylation with 1 M TBAF and conversion of 2-amino-6-chloropurine nucleobase into guanine with 2mercaptoethanol and 1 N NaOMe under reflux to produce guanine L-nucleoside L-5. The yields of each Mitsunobu condensation are generally low, probably because the fixed conformation induced by the fused cyclopropyl group and the double bond causes the backside attack of nucleobases to be disfavorable. In case of the locked conformation, increased steric hindrance between a methinyl hydrogen or a 4 0 -methylene group and nucleobase is expected. Antiviral activities with the final conformation-locked D-and Lcarbanucleosides were evaluated against HIV-1 (IIIB) and -2 (ROD), coxsackie B1 and B3 viruses, and HSV-1 and -2. First, when tested in MT-4 (HTLV-1 and -2-infected human T lymphocyte) cells, among the final nucleosides thymine nucleoside analogs D-2 and L-2 showed the most potent anti-HIV-1 and -2 activity and their IC 50 values against HIV-1 and -2 were 0.033 and 0.112 lg/mL for D-2, and 1.175 and 2.270 lg/mL for L-2, respectively ( Table 1 ).",

Comparison of IC 50 values of D-2 and L-2 against HIV-1 and -2 with those (2.31 and 2.76 lg/mL) of ddI, which is clinically used for the treatment of AIDS patients indicates that both thymine nucleosides D-2 and L-2 exhibit more potent anti-HIV-1 and -2 activities than ddI used as a positive control. Although anti-HIV activity of D-2 exceeds that of L-2, L-2 (CC 50 >100 lg mL \u00c01 ) is less cytotoxic than D-2 (CC 50 = 8.558 lg mL \u00c01 ), which corresponds to the fact that L-nucleosides have been generally known to be less toxic than D-counterpart. Selective indexes (CC 50 /EC 50 ) toward HIV-1 and -2 showed 263 and 76, respectively, for D-2 and more than 85.09 and more than 44.05, respectively, for 18 dro-2 0 ,3 0 -dideoxynucleosides whereas coxsakie viruses and poliovirus belong to RNA viruses. This point might result in lack of antiviral activities against coxsakie viruses and poliovirus. Antiviral evaluation against HSV-1 and -2 was conducted and only L-thymine nucleoside, L-2 showed weak anti-HSV-2 activity (IC 50 = 59.23 lg mL \u00c01 ) without discernible cytotoxicity.

A tandem alkylation, c-lactonization, a chemoselective reduction of ester in the presence of c-lactone functional group, a Grignard reaction, a RCM reaction, and a Mitsunobu coupling reaction were used as key reactions to achieve the synthesis of north conformation-locked D-and L-carbanucleoside analogs. The synthesized bicyclic carbanucleosides were characterized by 1 H, 13 C, HMBC, HSQC and COSY NMR, mass and UV spectra, melting point and optical rotation. D-Thymine nucleoside, D-2 and L-thymine nucleoside, L-2 were found to show more potent anti-HIV-1 and -2 activities than ddI in MT-4 cells. Whereas D-2 exhibited cytotoxicity (CC 50 = 8.558 lg mL \u00c01 ), L-2 did not show any discernible cytotoxicity, suggesting that L-2 may be a better candidate for the development of novel anti-AIDS drug than D-2. L-2 was also found to exhibit weak anti-HSV-2 activity without cytotoxicity. In addition, antiviral activities against RNA viruses such as coxsakie viruses, and poliovirus were tested, but all compounds did not show any significant antiviral activities, maybe due to a 2 0 ,3 0 -dideoxy structure of the compounds. L-2 was also evaluated against other RNA viruses such as influenza and corona viruses, but showed neither antiviral activity nor cytotoxicity. It is interesting to note that all L-nucleosides did not show cytotoxicity up to 100 lg mL \u00c01 in all cells tested. Probably, the low cytotoxicity of L-nucleosides may be closely associated with a L-type, an unnatural type. Potent antiviral activities of D-and L-thymine carbanucleosides, D-2 and L-2 indicate that a nucleoside belonging to a class of D4Ns can be an excellent candidate for anti-AIDS drug and anti-DNA virus agents. This research strongly supports L-nucleosides of a class of D4Ns to be a very promising candidate for antiviral agents due to its low cytotoxicity.",

The compounds were tested and compared to ddI and ddC obtained from Sigma for cytotoxicity and for their ability to inhibit HIV replication. The compounds were first dissolved in 100% DMSO and then diluted with RPMI-1640/10% FBS just before use. The maximum final concentration of DMSO added to the cell cultures was 0.5% at the highest concentration of the compound. We have determined that at that concentration DMSO does not interfere with cell growth. The HIV-1-induced cytopathic effects were monitored by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) viability assay.
