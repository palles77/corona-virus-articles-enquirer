The longevity of these immune responses may explain why these are considered as 'childhood diseases' because after the first exposure, lifelong protection against reinfection and disease is afforded. To explain these longterm antibody responses, several mechanisms have been proposed ( Table 2 ). The most simple explanation for long-term antibody production is that antibody levels are boosted by repeated exposure to infectious virus. Alternatively, a low-grade viral infection may persist, or viral antigen may remain, in the form of antigenantibody complexes that are sequestered and retained on the surface of FDC.",

Although repeated exposure to a virus will almost certainly boost and enhance humoral immunity, examples of four acute viral infections that induce longterm antibody production in the absence of re-exposure are described in Table 3 . Despite being an indirect measurement of antibody maintenance, Panum's classic epidemiological study of measles outbreaks on the Faroe Islands showed that measles infected only individuals who had had no previous exposure to the virus but spared those who had been exposed to measles >65 years previouslyE Similar epidemiological studies REVIEWS of polio and yellow fever outbreaks in isolated communities confirm Panum's results by demonstrating longterm humoral immunity in the absence of recurrent infection *s,~8. In addition, immunization with vaccinia virus induces antibody production that is maintained for at least 15 years 2~. Re-exposure is unlikely in each of these examples because there were either no reported cases of infection during the decades in between epidemics 15'6' 1s or, in the case of vaccinia, there is no longer any circulating virus because smallpox vaccination was discontinued in 1977 and none of the subjects in the study worked in laboratories where vaccinia was used 2~. Some viral infections that are normally classified as acute may actually persist after clinical symptoms have subsided. For example, measles and rubella virus have been found to persist for years after the initial infec-tion 53,54. However, it is difficult to believe that lowgrade chronic infection is the only mechanism behind long-term antibody production because a variety of acute infections induce life-long immunity (Table 1) and it is unlikely that they each develop into low-grade persisting infections. In addition, nonreplicating antigens, such as tetanus toxoid, induce antibody responses that last >20 years, and pre-existing antibody to diphtheria toxoid has been identified 25-30years postimmunization s5,56. Overall, long-term serum antibody responses are a common theme among acute systemic viral infections and the longevity of such responses does not appear to be dependent upon repeated exposure or chronic viral infection.",

Although cross-reactivity to self antigens or the development of idiotypic networks are plausible, current dogma suggests that antibody production is maintained by memory B cells that are stimulated to become ASC by antigen trapped on the surface of FDC 9-11 . According to work by Tew and Mandel sT, specific antigen appears to follow two stages of degradation. First, there is rapid loss of antigen, with over 99% cleared in the first 2-3 days. Antigen half-life values ranged from about 3 hours on day 1, to 40 hours on day 4. Later, the degradation was much slower, with a half-life of -8 weeks (95% confidence interval of 5.1-20 weeks)% In this study, it was estimated that about 300 000 molecules of antigen were distributed among each FDC. However, if antigenic decay (halflife = 8 weeks) is extrapolated to 3 years, only about one molecule of antigen per cell would remain. Following these kinetics, is it possible that persisting antigen alone could account for >70 years of yellow-fever-specific antibody production~-~? In addition, vaccination with nonreplicating antigens, such as tetanus and diphtheria toxoid, induces antigen-specific antibody responses that last for decades ss,s6. The concept of persisting antigen therefore poses several intriguing questions. For instance, despite the decay rate of the antigen itself s7, one must consider how antigen-antibody complexes on FDC escape from being consumed during the continuous stimulation of memory B cells. As B cells require T cell help in order to proliferate and differentiate into ASC 49-51, this would require antigen uptake, processing and presentation. If antigen is not consumed during this process and antigen-antibody complexes degrade very slowly over time, then another consideration is the half-life of the FDC itself. If antigen is retained for great lengths of time, then we must indirectly assume that FDC also have a long life span. This in itself would be an important finding because FDC are an integral part of the persisting antigen theory and little is known about the half-life of these highly specialized antigen-retaining cells. Another mechanism that is not exclusive to the theory of persisting antigen is that antibody production may be maintained by longlived plasma cells. If plasma cells do have a long life span, then the requirement for long-term antigen retention may not be so critical in sustaining immunological memory.",

This model emphasizes what may be the most overlooked component of longterm humoral immunity: long-lived plasma cells. After migrating to the bone marrow 3(~-39, which contains a rich source of growth factors and cytokines, plasma cells may settle into a stable microenvironment, sheltered from the radical changes that occur in peripheral lymphoid follicles following new, or recurrent, viral and bacterial infections. Moreover, as plasma cells lose nearly all surface-bound immunoglobulin, they are presumably insensitive to antigenic stimulation and therefore would be unaffected if antigen became a limiting factor. Soon after rats have been immunized, it is apparent that most plasma cells have a very short half-life, with estimates ranging from 8 hours to -3 days sS-<. This may be misleading, however, because after the initial immune response has peaked and then subsided, the remaining plasma cells appear to survive for several weeks 62 to more than 6 months 63. If just early timepoints are studied, this biphasic response could go unrecognized and could easily be interpreted as an indication that plasma cells are shortqived. It is only by examining late timepoints after immunization that a stable subpopulation of long-lived ASC can be readily identified 63. In addition to these studies, preliminary data indicate that long-lived plasma cells in mice are induced after acute LCMV infection (M.K. Slifka and R. Ahmed, unpublished).",

            "text": "After antigenic stimulation, these lymphoid tissues show similar kinetics to the spleen (Box 1), including a shortlived local ASC response that peaks early and is followed by ASC migration to the bone marrow as local antibody production subsides. For mucosal immunity, however, this may be a 'one-way street' because once ASC migrate to the bone marrow they are unlikely to continue to contribute to mucosal antibody production. This may, in part, explain why local mucosal antibody responses tend to decline more rapidly than serum antibody responses.",

            "text": "To sustain humoral immunity against a pathogen for greater than half a century is a remarkable accomplishment. The question of whether the longevity of this response results from persisting antigen, long-lived plasma cells or a combination of both deserves further attention. To understand fully how persisting antigen continues to provide an immunogenic stimulus over the course of several years, it will be essential to gain a more extensive biochemical and biological understanding of how antigen-antibody complexes are maintained on the surface of FDC. In addition, determining the half-life of FDC, memory T cells, memory B cells and plasma cells will be essential to our understanding of how long-term humoral responses are maintained. It is hoped that a greater knowledge of these mechanisms will allow better design of adjuvants and vaccines that are potentially capable of providing long-term protective immunity.",

Most serum antibody is produced in the spleen (lymph nodes, etc.) and few plasma cells accumulate in the bone marrow. (b) After resolving the viral infection, most antigen is bound in antigen-antibody complexes on follicular dendritic cells (FDC) and may intermittently stimulate memory B cells to differentiate into plasma cells. At this stage, most serum antibody is produced by long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow, with only a few plasma cells remaining in the spleen. Which cell type migrates to the bone marrow has not been established but it is possible that terminal differentiation of plasma cells may occur after migration. (\u00a2) Months after clearing an acute infection, antigen levels may drop below an immunological threshold of activation and the immune response would then return to homeostasis. Memory B cells enter a resting state and no longer differentiate into plasma cells, unless restimulated by antigen. Our model proposes that plasma cells in the bone marrow, and a subpopulation of plasma cells in the spleen and lymph nodes, have a long life span, and that serum antibody levels may be sustained for several years in the absence of antigenic restimulation.
