Combining ALVAC with protein antigens significantly augmented antigen-specific IgG2a responses; this was dependent on the presence of bioactive interferon (IFN)-\u2425. Immuno-depletion of NK cells prior to ALVAC immunisation abrogated IFN-\u2425 production indicating that they are the main cellular source of early IFN-\u2425 in vivo. Murine bone-marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) cultured in the presence of ALVAC secreted high levels of the chemokines CXCL10 and CCL2 and up-regulated expression of the maturation markers CD40, CD80 and CD86. Therefore, we conclude that ALVAC acts as an adjuvant through a mechanism requiring NK cell derived IFN-\u2425, DC activation and chemokine secretion.",

            "text": "In this study, we confirm that ALVAC acts as an adjuvant, enhancing antigen-specific IgG2a to co-injected protein antigen in mice. Intra-muscular (i.m.) injection of ALVAC increases levels of circulating IFN-\u2423 and IFN-\u2425 shortly after injection. ALVAC enhanced antigen-specific IgG2a responses to co-injected protein antigen in IFN-\u2423 Receptor knockout (IFN-\u2423R \u2212/\u2212 ) mice but not IFN-\u2425R \u2212/\u2212 mice, indicating the importance of bioactive IFN-\u2425 in mediating the adjuvant effect of ALVAC. Immuno-depletion of NK cells dramatically impaired the ability of ALVAC to induce circulating IFN-\u2425, indicating that these cells are the major producer of this cytokine in vivo. A previous study has shown that ALVAC triggers TNF-\u2423 production by human DCs [9] . As the interaction between NK and DCs is important for the induction of the innate immune response [10] we investigated the effect of ALVAC exposure on murine BMDC regarding maturation and cytokine production. We show that under the experimental conditions we used, low levels of apoptosis were detected, and that ALVAC induces the maturation of DCs (up-regulation of CD40, CD80 and CD86 expression) and the production of low levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u2423 and IL-12). However, a marked increase in the secretion of the chemokines CXCL10 and CCL2 was observed. Therefore, this leads us to suggest that ALVAC can act as a Th1 polarizing adjuvant by inducing local inflammation [7] , resulting in DC maturation and chemokine production which in turn causes the recruitment of IFN-\u2425 secreting NK cells.",

Therefore, we wished to determine if IFN-\u2423 and/or IFN-\u2425 were produced in vivo following an injection of ALVAC. Groups of Balb/c mice were immunised simultaneously by the i.m. route with 1/10th of the human dose of ALVAC and i.p. with a biotin-conjugated anti-IFN-\u2425 mAb, and subsequently the mice were bled at various time-points after immunisation. Levels of the IFN-\u2425:mAb complex were determined by ELISA. Significant quantities of IFN-\u2425 were detectable in the circulation of mice 15 h after immunisation ( Fig. 2A) . The IFN-\u2425:mAb complex continued to accumulate in the circulation of the ALVAC immunised mice up to 72 h post-immunisation ( Fig. 2A) . The anti-IFN-\u2425 antibody is stable for up to 72 h in vivo. Using 1/50th of the human dose resulted in less circulating IFN-\u2425 than 1/10th of the human dose, illustrating the effect is dose-dependent ( Fig. 2A) . In order to detect circulating IFN-\u2423 groups of Balb/c mice were immunised i.m. with 1/10th of the human dose of ALVAC and then bled at various time-points, and the levels of IFN-\u2423 in the serum were determined by ELISA. A low and transient amount of IFN-\u2423 could be detected at 2 h in the serum of ALVAC immunised mice (Fig. 2B) . In summary, ALVAC immunisation induces a low amount of IFN-\u2423 and significant amounts of IFN-\u2425 with very different kinetics. IFN-\u2423 being early and transient and IFN-\u2425 appearing later but more sustained. However, as we used an in vivo capture assay to determine the circulating amounts of IFN-\u2425 (stable IFN-\u2425:mAb complex) and a straightforward ELISA approach to detect the relatively labile IFN-\u2423, we cannot draw any conclusions about the relative importance of the two cytokines in the adjuvanticity of ALVAC from these data. At various time points serum samples were prepared from these mice and frozen at \u221220 \u2022 C until analysis. Levels of the complex of mAb + IFN\u2425 were determined by an ELISA using a standard curve generated using recombinant IFN-\u2425 that had been pre-incubated with biotinylated mAb. Results are expresses as mean cytokine concentration \u00b1 standard deviation. * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001 and ns = not significant. (B) In a separate experiment groups of Balb/c mice (5 per group) were immunised with Placebo or ALVAC (1/10 human dose) at time 0. Serum samples were removed at various time-points and frozen at \u221220 \u2022 C until analysis. Levels of serum IFN-\u2423 were determined by ELISA in triplicate on serum pools from each group.

NK cell depletion was achieved using two doses of a polyclonal anti-asialo-GM1 Ab, one given 5 days before and the second together with the ALVAC injection. The efficacy of this depletion is illustrated by the lack of CD49b (a NK cell specific marker in Balb/c mice) expressing cells in the spleens of anti-asislo-GM1 treated mice compared with mice treated with an isotype control antibody (Fig. 4B) . Groups of mice, either NK cell depleted or not, were immunised with Placebo or ALVAC and were given a simultaneous i.p. injection of biotin-anti-IFN-\u2425. After 3 days, the mice were sacrificed and their serum analysed for the levels of circulating IFN-\u2425:mAb complex by ELISA.

However, here as we are examining the adjuvant effect of ALVAC we are interested in investigating the immuno-modulatory effects of exposing cells to ALVAC without them necessarily becoming infected. In addition in vitro infection protocols using low or no serum conditions and a high MOI have been shown to induce apoptosis in the target cells [9] . Preliminary experiments showed that a MOI of 0.2 to 1 did not induce significant cell death in murine bone-marrow derived DCs (BMDCs) over a culture period of 24 h (data not shown). Murine BMDCs were cultured for 24 h at a concentration of 10 6 cells/ml in complete RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS alone or with the addition of ALVAC with a MOI of 0.2, the equivalent volume of Placebo or with a TLR4 agonist as a positive control. Cells were then stained with fluorescently labelled mAbs specific for the co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80 and CD86 and their expression levels were analysed by flow cytometry. The percentage of BMDCs expressing co-stimulatory molecules (CD40, CD80 and CD86) was significantly increased following exposure to ALVAC compared to medium alone or Placebo (Fig. 5A-C) . However, the enhancement of costimulatory molecule expression induced by ALVAC was weaker than that observed following the stimulation of BMDCs with a TLR4 agonist (Fig. 5A-C) .

We show that bioactive IFN-\u2425 but not IFN-\u2423 is crucial for this adjuvant effect, as antigenspecific IgG2a responses to co-injected protein are enhanced in IFN-\u2423R \u2212/\u2212 mice but not IFN-\u2425R \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 3C) . Immuno-depletion of NK cells revealed that they are an important source of the innate IFN-\u2425 produced in response to ALVAC injection in vivo (Fig. 4A) . Furthermore, we show that stimulation of murine BMDCs with ALVAC in vitro can induce DC maturation (Fig. 5A-C) and chemokine secretion (particularly CXCL10 and CCL2, Fig. 6A and B) . Additionally, ALVAC injection resulted in an enlargement of the local draining lymph node (popliteal) following i.m. injection (data not shown). Therefore, we can conclude that ALVAC injection activates the innate immune response enhancing the induction of Th1 responses to co-injected antigen.",

We show that injection of ALVAC results in an increase in the levels of both circulating IFN-\u2423 and IFN-\u2425 ( Fig. 2A and B) . In order to determine if the induction of one or both of these cytokines was crucial for the adjuvant effect of ALVAC, we immunised wild type (129/Sv), IFN-\u2423R \u2212/\u2212 and IFN-\u2425R \u2212/\u2212 mice with gB (CMV) either with or without ALVAC. Both the 129/Sv and IFN-\u2423R \u2212/\u2212 mice that received gB and ALVAC produced higher titres of gB specific IgG2a when compared to the groups that received gB and Placebo (Fig. 3) , indicating that bioactive IFN-\u2423 is dispensable for the adjuvant effect of ALVAC. A study investigating the immunogenicity of adenovirus vectors demonstrated that although type I IFN signalling is an important component of adenovirus-mediated DC maturation, it was dispensable during the generation of transgene product specific CD8 + T cell responses [16] . Therefore, it appears that although IFN-\u2423 is induced by ALVAC and may well play a role in augmenting the innate immune response, it is not required for its' adjuvant effect.",

Additionally, exposure to ALVAC induced murine BMDCs to secrete significant quantities of the chemokines CXCL10 and CCL2 (Fig. 6 ). CXCL10 (IP-10) is chemotactic for T cells [22] and NK cells [23] expressing CXCR3. While CCL2 (MCP-1) plays a role in the recruitment of monocytes/macrophages by interacting with CCR2. Recent studies with CXCL10 neutralising antibodies or CXCL10 \u2212/\u2212 mice demonstrate that the absence of functional CXCL10 results in increased mortality and reduced T cell infiltration within the brains of mice infected intracerebrally with a murine coronavirus [22, 24] , illustrating the importance of this chemokine in co-ordinating a protective immune response against a viral pathogen. CCL2's interaction with CCR2 is an important factor promoting early inflammatory responses and effective local antiviral defense [25] . The ability of ALVAC to induce DCs to secrete chemokines, such as CXCL10 may provide the signal required for NK cells to migrate to DC-rich areas bringing them in close proximity enabling direct cell-cell contact, thereby resulting in downstream Th1 responses.",

Using flow cytometric analysis of the lymph node cells we could not determine a change in the % of any cell type (data not shown). These data in conjunction with previous work by Boudet et al. demonstrate that ALVAC can trigger an inflammatory response, induce the migration of neutrophils to the site of inoculation within 6 h of administration [7] and enlargement of the local draining lymph node. Therefore, we now propose the following mechanism for the adjuvanticity of ALVAC: ALVAC causes inflammation, and PMN recruitment to the site of injection [7] . This, in turn, causes the activation of local DCs (as demonstrated by increased co-stimulatory molecule expression). These cells may then migrate to the local draining lymph node. Here, DC secretion of chemokines including CCL2 and CXCL10 cause an influx of cells including NK and T cells. The interaction of the DC and NK cells in the local lymph node triggers IFN-\u2425 secretion by the NK cells that results in an increase in Th1 cells specific for the co-administered protein. When these cells re-circulate to the B cell rich areas of the spleen they enhance isotype switching to IgG2a.",
