These differences become apparent quickly when the nondomestic neonate requires treatment, and an understanding of the special needs and risks involved can prevent unnecessary problems and losses.

Species with strong herd instincts may be most successful when housed with conspecifics during calving season, and many will demonstrate birth synchrony. 6, 7 However, wild ruminant species vary widely in social grouping and behavior, and captive grouping can affect reproductive success. 8 Research into the best captive social environment for the species in question before birth can maximize the chance of successful birth and maternal care. Timing exposure of females to males in nonseasonal or seasonally polyestrous species to maximize the chance of late spring or early summer births in temperate zones can also improve neonatal survival in pasture-managed animals.

While anterior dorsosacral presentation of the fetus with forelimbs extended is by far the most common, posterior dorsosacral presentation with the hindlimbs extended is very common in some species, such as Pere David's deer (Elaphurus davidianus) and red deer (Cervus elaphus) and may or may not cause difficulty in parturition. The most common causes of dystocia in cattle are malpresentation of the fetus and maternofetal disproportion. Dystocia is not uncommon in nondomestic ruminants, particularly in species of limited genetic diversity, and represents an important risk factor for morbidity and mortality in domestic 13 and nondomestic calves. In fact, beef calves born following dystocia are 2 to 6 times more likely than normal-birth calves to develop disease within 45 days of birth. 14, 15 Nondomestic ruminant neonates are at even greater risk than domestic calves following dystocia due to the necessity of general anesthesia for birth intervention. Furthermore, many dams will not accept an offspring following general anesthesia, resulting in FPT and the need for hand-rearing. Hypoxemia and acidosis in the calf (discussed later) are possible sequelae to dystocia that may also lead to FPT, although it is unclear whether this is due to a direct effect on Ig absorption or to resulting weakness and inability of the neonate to stand and nurse. 16 ",

            "text": "Neonates born following dystocia or under extreme environmental conditions are more likely to require resuscitation and medical care than those experiencing normal birth conditions. Once the decision is made to treat these cases, early intervention is essential. Dystocia is likely to cause both respiratory and metabolic acidosis. Following normal birth, mild respiratory acidosis may occur for a few hours and metabolic acidosis for up to 48 hours. 18 However, severe acidosis can result in reduced vigor, decreased suckling response and an increased chance of FPT. 19 A good indicator of acidosis is time to sternal recumbency: in cattle, more than 15 minutes to sternal recumbency is associated with low survival. 20 Poor muscle tone and decreased pedal reflexes are also suggestive of acidosis. Scleral and conjunctival hemorrhage indicate both hypoxia and acidosis and can also signal a poor prognosis. 21 Establishment of a patent airway, initiation of a normal breathing pattern, and establishing adequate circulation are the first priorities in the treatment of a critical neonate. In general, cardiac resuscitation is not indicated, as neonates born without a heart beat are not likely to survive. 15 Attention should be paid to physical stimulation of the neonate, as severe acidosis may cause depression of the central reflexes that initiate respiration. 15 To clear the airway, place the neonate in sternal recumbency and clear fluids and physical obstructions by hand or suction. Rub the neonate vigorously with towels or bedding to simulate the phrenic nerve, which innervates the diaphragm. If respiration is not immediately initiated, stimulation of the nasal passage or pharynx with a finger or piece of straw should induce an inspiratory reflex. Acupuncture at the philtrum may also stimulate respiration. 22 Neonates born to anesthetized dams may have respiratory depression resulting from pharmacologic sedation, and specific antagonists should be administered to the neonate as well as to the dam. Doxapram hydrochloride stimulates central chemoreceptors and may be beneficial in calves born with mild respiratory suppression, but it is unlikely to be effective in severely depressed neonates. Use of doxapram as a respiratory stimulant has demonstrated varying results, [23] [24] [25] but it may improve acid-base balance. 22 If these methods are unsuccessful, endotracheal intubation and positive pressure ventilation are preferable to mouth-to-nose ventilation for providing respiratory support. Oxygen therapy, if available, has been shown to improve neonatal survival in at-risk domestic calves and is best administered via endotracheal tube. 15 Placement of an intravenous catheter and fluid therapy as necessary can improve the chance of survival in compromised neonates, and provides a means of treating metabolic abnormalities rapidly. Metabolic acidosis can be treated with a bolus of sodium bicarbonate (1-2 mEq/kg) 19 following the establishment of a normal breathing pattern. Treatment before establishing normal breathing, however, is likely to exacerbate respiratory acidosis.",

In the neonate, the primary source of bacterial contamination of blood is the intestine due to nonspecific pinocytosis. In older calves, enteritis may cause septicemia through loss of integrity of the intestinal wall. By the second or third week of age, omphalophlebitis, arthritis, pneumonia, and meningitis may result in septicemia. 28 Septicemic calves between 2 and 6 days of age present with vague signs such as altered mentation (ranging from mild signs to coma), depression, or decreased suckle response with or without diarrhea. The condition is most often rapidly fatal. Physical exam findings may include hypothermia or hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, hyperemia or petechiae of mucous membranes, increased capillary refill time, cold extremities, and diminished peripheral pulse. Point-of-care testing is likely to reveal hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, hypoxia, and hypotension. Observation of any combination of these signs should lead the practitioner to suspect septicemia and/or meningitis and act quickly. Blood culture before initiation of antibiotics is prudent. Treatment should include fluid therapy and intravenous antibiotics, the choice of which should include activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. Commonly encountered pathogens and resistance patterns at the institution should also be considered when choosing antibiotics. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are helpful in modulating the inflammatory response once hydration is corrected. Correction of hypothermia and hypoglycemia should be addressed immediately (see Table 1 ). When treating a hypoglycemic neonate, dextrose may be delivered intraperitoneally if venous access is a challenge due to profound hypotension or dehydration. Check blood glucose frequently during the initial 24 hours of treatment. Inability to correct hypoglycemia despite treatment is suggestive of septicemia.",

Therefore, neonatal ruminants rely on the intestinal absorption of antibodies from colostrum, produced by the dam in the first 24 hours postpartum, for humoral protection from environmental pathogens. Endogenous production of antibodies by the calf does not reach protective levels until at least 1 month of age. While observation of a strong neonate suckling normally from the dam in the first hours after birth is a practical indicator of successful passive transfer, the performance of neonatal physical exams on all calves is a good practice. This exam allows the practitioner to check for medical and congenital conditions, apply an identification tag, supplement vitamin E and selenium if needed, and collect blood for passive transfer testing if maternal care is in question. Detection of IgG in plasma is possible as soon as 2 hours after a colostrum feeding. Therefore, timing of neonatal physical exams may be determined by many factors, such as the mobility of the neonate, the observation (or lack thereof) of nursing and the ability to find \"hider\" species in large pastures. Generally, the behavior of the dam of hider species is a very poor guide to the location of the neonate. Common tests for passive transfer are listed in Table 2 . While radial immunodiffusion is considered the gold standard test for passive transfer, it is a species-specific laboratory test and not practical for rapid diagnosis of FPT in nondomestic ruminants. Similarly, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while useful as a stall-side test for domestic calves, is also a species-specific test and therefore not practical for nondomestic species. Several commercially available tests, as described in Table 2 , are sufficiently sensitive to rapidly identify FPT to allow for the immediate development of a treatment plan.",

            "text": "In domestic calves, colostrum absorption occurs during the first 24 to 36 hours of life. The timing of this nonselective absorption of macromolecules including IgG ends approximately 24 hours after the first meal. 32 Peak Ig transfer across the enterocytes occurs during the first 4 hours postpartum and declines rapidly after 12 hours [33] [34] [35] ; therefore early colostrum intake should result in higher IgG serum concentration. Peak serum IgG concentration occurs 32 hours postpartum. 15 FPT occurs when inadequate levels of IgG are absorbed, predisposing the neonate to the development of disease. Even calves nursing from their dams can experience FPT by ingesting an inadequate volume of colostrum during the critical time period or by ingesting colostrum of relatively low IgG content. FPT calves experience higher rates of neonatal mortality, and this higher mortality rate can extend to the postweaning period. 16 The decision to treat a calf with FPT and the method of treatment should be based on several factors including the animal's age, species, value, and environment and the availability of colostrum, plasma, and other resources. Calves suffering from FPT are at greater risk for developing disease but can survive if placed in a clean environment with low exposure to infectious pathogens. Immunocompetent calves are able to produce approximately 1 g of IgG per day. 35, 36 Despite this, they cannot respond to certain antigens, such as gram-negative bacteria, until 30 days of age. 37 The prophylactic use of broad-spectrum, parenteral antimicrobials in calves with FPT should be considered but must be combined with colostrum replacement and management practices that minimize pathogen exposure. 16 FPT calves less than 24 hours of age can be treated orally with fresh colostrum, commercial colostrum replacer, or plasma. It is very difficult to collect a volume of colostrum sufficient to prevent FPT from a lactating nondomestic ruminant. Bovine colostrum is an alternative, but there is an inherent risk of disease transmission (eg, Johne disease) associated with this practice. Commercial colostrum replacers are therefore recommended for neonatal nondomestic ruminants. Serum contains significantly lower IgG concentrations than does colostrum and is thereby not a good choice for oral administration. Commercial hyperimmune plasma, however, is a viable alternative. Oral administration should be attempted first with a bottle, but weak calves or those that do not take readily to a bottle should receive colostrum via oroesophageal intubation (see below) or parenteral plasma transfusion.",

Ideally, as much colostrum as possible should be fed within the first 4 hours to maximize absorption of IgG.

If plasma or whole blood is unavailable, the use of commercial plasma is an option. Commercially available equine plasma has been used successfully in nondomestic ruminants to prevent FPT. 39 Plasma can also be administered intraperitoneally (IP). This procedure is less invasive and intensive than IV administration and allows the calf to be returned to the dam in a shorter period of time. While the recommended plasma dose for intravenous administration is 40 ml/kg, IP administration may require a larger volume of plasma. To administer plasma IP, an area in the left paralumbar fossa is clipped and surgically prepared. A needle is inserted through the skin, abdominal musculature, and peritoneum in the center of the paralumbar fossa. Alternatively, local anesthesia can be used before making a stab incision and then inserting an 18 gauge \u03eb 2 inch over-the-needle indwelling catheter.

Many commercial milk replacers are available but the authors have experience with LAND O LAKES Doe's Match (Land O'Lakes Animal Milk Products, Shoreview, MN, USA) a and Zoologic Milk Matrix (PetAg, Inc., Hampshire, IL, USA). b Goat's milk is often used and is a good choice for many species, used alone or in combination with a milk replacer. However, unless fortified, goat's milk does not contain vitamin E and is relatively low in zinc and copper. Most milk is naturally low in iron. For these reasons, a vitamin and mineral supplement is often added to the formula. Adding probiotics to the formula may be beneficial in establishing a healthy rumen flora.",

            "text": "In the first 2 to 3 weeks of a ruminant's life, termed the preruminant phase, digestion of milk occurs in the abomasum and small intestine. During this phase, milk deposited into the nonfunctional rumenoreticulum (eg, via tube feeding) is not digested and often leads to rumenitis and septicemia. 41 Reflex closure of the esophageal groove, stimulated by suckling, normally prevents this deposition. If tube feeding is required during this time, the tube can be passed to the mid-esophagus to stimulate swallowing and closure of the groove. Additionally, milk feeding can be preceded by oral administration of 10% sodium bicarbonate or 2-5% copper sulfate, which facilitates groove closure for several minutes. 42 Esophageal feeding should be conducted using gravity flow. During the transitional phase, which begins at 2 to 3 weeks of age, the calf begins to take in small amounts of dry feed and the volatile fatty acids butyric and propionic acid stimulate differentiation of the ruminal papillae. 43 By this age, the neonate should be provided with a variety of appropriate hay, pelleted ration, and calf supplements to begin to sample, in addition to the milk ration. From initiation of solid feed through weaning, sand or dirt ingestion is common in some areas. Sand ingestion can be due to formula imbalances, gastrointestinal diseases, stress, or boredom, but determining the exact etiology is often difficult. Impaction can result as can the need for medical and/or surgical intervention. Since ingestion can lead to impaction, it is best recognized early as a symptom of an underlying problem. The calf should be housed away from sand or dirt while the etiologies are explored, and it may be necessary to attempt formula changes in lieu of a diagnosis as the exact imbalance may not be obvious. Early weaning may be considered in some cases.",

The transition from preruminant to ruminant and the weaning process both result in changes in gastrointestinal flora and, often, fecal consistency.

It is ideal to hand-raise nondomestic ruminants with conspecifics or other nondomestic ruminants of similar age. Herd-adapted species need the psychological benefits that result from companionship. They also need a playmate to ensure adequate bouts of activity and exercise. If another hand-reared animal is not available, an older, calm \"aunt\" is a suitable substitute. Using an older animal has the added benefit of exposing the hand-reared animal to normal fecal flora. Before reintroduction to the herd, it is beneficial to first introduce it to a companion animal to reduce the chance of rejection by the herd. Once bonded, the pair can be introduced together.

For instance, hand-reared male elk and other species imprinted on humans can be very dangerous as adults. A plan to reduce imprinting should be in place within the first few days of life and continue until weaning and complete introduction to the herd. Fig. 1 depicts a device for hand-rearing that minimizes exposure to human presence and scent. A framed box large enough for a person to stand in is covered with tarp or heavy cloth. The front of the box consists of a 2-way mirror and 2 hand-sized ports for feeding the calf. The handler enters the box from behind, avoiding being seen by the calf, and carries the box toward the calf. Alternatively, the calf can be trained with a clicker to approach the box. The handler uses leather gloves that may be covered with conspecific female urine to encourage appropriate scent recognition and feeds the neonate with a bottle using the ports in the front of the box, avoiding exposure of the arms. The 2-way mirror allows the handler to see the neonate, but the neonate sees itself. This type of device has been used in combination with early weaning and reintroduction to the herd to raise orphaned male ungulates to be socially normal herd members as adults.",

Housing of the dam, conditions for birth, preparation for intervention, and plans for treatment and hand-rearing of sick neonates must all be considered carefully before undertaking nondomestic ruminant breeding. Unfortunately, neonatal losses tend to be much higher in nondomestic calves before weaning than in domestic cattle, sheep, and goat herds. 1 With continued habitat and population declines in wild species, successful captive breeding of nondomestic herds becomes more important to species sustainability and potential reintroduction programs. The primary challenges contributing to neonatal losses in nondomestic ruminants are often animal temperament and adaptation to captivity. Only through experience can some of these challenges be overcome. However, by understanding some species-specific behavioral tendencies and the fractious nature of nondomestic ruminants in Fig. 1 . An approach to hand-rearing that minimizes social imprinting on humans.
