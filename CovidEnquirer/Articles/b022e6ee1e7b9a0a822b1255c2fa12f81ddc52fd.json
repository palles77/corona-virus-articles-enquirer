Northern blot analysis showed a widespread distribution of H-Lse in various human tissues with high expression in the testis, prostate, and colon. In situ hybridization results showed that while H-Lse was not detected in embryonic testis, positive signals were found in spermatocytes but not spermatogonia in adult testis of human. The subcellular localization of H-Lse was visualized by green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the amino terminus of H-Lse, showing compartmentalization of H-Lse in large dense-core vesicles, presumably lysosomes, in the cytoplasm. The developmentally regulated and spermatogenic stage-specific expression of H-Lse suggests its possible involvement in the development of the testis and/or differentiation of germ cells.",

There are five types of germ cells, each at a specific developmental stage, found in the seminiferous tubules: spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes, secondary spermatocytes, spermatids and sperms. They can be divided into three groups according to their DNA content: 4N DNA content cells (4C cells), 2N DNA content cells (2C cells), and 1N DNA content cells (1C cells). The separation of these cells enables researchers to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying testicular development and/or spermatogenesis. In the present study, we separated the 2C and 4C cells of seminiferous tubules in human adult testis by flow cytometry, and identified human H-Lse by differential display RT-PCR. The expression pattern of H-Lse was found to be developmentally regulated and stage-specific, indicating its possible role in testicular development and/or germ cell differentiation.",

In the mitotic phase, spermatogonia proliferate to expand the quantity of germ cells; in the meiotic phase, spermatocytes accomplish chromosomal synapsis and genetic recombination before two meiotic divisions; and in the postmeiotic phase, haploid spermatids are remodeled into spermatozoa by the processes of acrosome formation, nuclear condensation, flagellar development, and loss of the majority of cytoplasm. Under the control of intrinsic and extrinsic factors, spermatogenesis is characterized by the expression of a spectrum of genes that are celltype-specific or stage-specific. They are thought to play an essential role in spermatogenesis at particular stages. For example, MutS homologue 5 is required for chromosome pairing, CPEB and SCP3 are required for synaptonemal complex assembly and chromosome synapsis in primary spermatocytes [15, 16, 17] .",

            "text": "In the present study, we have identified a gene, H-Lse, from human adult testis with high homology to m-Cse 1 [19] . Similarly, it can inhibit binding of sialoadhesin, a macrophage-restricted and sialic-acid-dependent adhesion molecule [20] . On the other hand, 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids can form novel epitopes. Influenza virus C haemagglutinin specifically requires 9-O-acetylated sialic acids for binding to host cells [21] . Incubation of red blood cells with sialate 9-Oacetylesterase rendered the erythrocytes resistant against agglutination by influenza C virus [22] . O-acetylation of disialoganglioside GD3 by human melanoma cells has been reported to create a unique antigenic determinant [23] . Modifications of sialic acids may be an important mechanism underlying the interaction/cross-talk between different types of cells. The essential role of sialic acids modification in cellular communications may explain the presently observed wide distribution of H-Lse in all examined tissues. The present study suggests that the expression of H-Lse is developmentally regulated and spermatogenic stage-specific. The evidence for this includes: (1) lack of expression in embryonic testis; (2) association of high level of mRNA detected by DD-RT-PCR with the 4C but not 2C cells in adult testes; and (3) detection of in situ hybridization signal in spermatocytes but not spermatogonia or other somatic cells. In the absence of spermatogenesis, embryonic testis contains only two distinct cell types, spermatogonia and Sertoli cells, while the seminiferous epithelium of adult testis consists of germ cells at different stages of spermatogensis. The 4C cells found in adult testis include the primary spermatocytes and spermatogonia of G 2 /M stage, while 2C cells include spermatogonia of G0/G1 stage, secondary spermatocytes, and Sertoli cells. The absence of H-Lse mRNA in embryonic testis and the high level of its mRNA in the 4C cells of adult testis suggest that its expression is restricted to spermatocytes, particularly the primary spermatocytes. Together with the in situ hybridization results showing mRNA of H-Lse restricted to spermatocytes, but not spermatogonia, Sertoli cells or interstitial cells, these data suggest that H-Lse is likely to be involved in the process of spermatogenesis, although its role in testicular development cannot be entirely ruled out. Unfortunately, due to the deformation of the available human testes, we were not able to make further distinction between primary and secondary spermatocytes. What has been clearly shown by the present data is that H-Lse is only present at a stage beyond spermatogonia, suggesting its possible role in the differentiation of germ cells.",

Transgenic mice constitutively overexpressed the 9-O-acetyl-sialicacid-specific esterase of influenza C that has been found to arrest embryo development at the two-cells stage. It has also been reported that in vitro development of embryonic stem cells shows that the expression level of Lse is low at the initiation of the development, and followed by an increase at later stages [24] . In transgenic mice with selective expression of 9-O-acetyl-sialic-acid-specific esterase in retina and the adrenal gland, these organs showed various abnormalities in organization, while all other tissues appeared normal [25] . Lse has also been considered to play a key role in the differentiation of B lymphocyte [2] , since it is expressed in late but not early B lymphocyte. The presently observed developmentdependent pattern of H-Lse expression is consistent with that found in other cell types: absence or low expression at early stage of differentiation but high at later stages. Taken together, 9-O-acetyl esters in sialic acids appear to be important for development or cellular differentiation.",

            "text": "Spermatogenesis is a multiple-staged continuous progress of cellular differentiation. It has been reported that some cell surface glycoconjugates are modified during the early steps of spermatogenesis, and influence the differentiation of spermatogenic cells [26] . As ninecarbon sugars commonly found in many glycoproteins of spermatogenic cells, sialic acids represent a target for cell surface modification, that is, removal of 9-O-acetyl esters by enzymes such as Lse. Modification of sialic acids may result in alteration in cell-cell communication, that is, Sertoli cells and germ cells interaction, thereby influencing the differentiation of spermatogenic cells. Thus, future studies on the presently identified H-Lse may provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying testicular development and/or germ cell differentiation during spermatogenesis in humans.",

Three distinct mRNA species at approximately 2.7 kb, 6.0 kb, and 7.5 kb are detected in MTN membranes; beta-actin is the control.mouse Lse. The subcellular localization of GFP-H-Lse fusion protein showed that H-Lse is concentrated in vesiclelike structures in the cytoplasm, presumably the lysosomes, indicating that H-Lse is likely to be the lysosome form of sialic-acid-specific 9-O-acetylesterase. However, our northern blot analysis shows transcripts of different sizes with different tissue distributions. They may be the tissue-specific transcripts of H-Lse since others have reported that there are multiple transcripts of mouse sialicacid-specific 9-O-acetylesterase[2,10,18]. The wide distribution of the expected transcript of H-Lse, approximately 2.7 kbp, in all tissues examined suggests an essential role of H-Lse in cellular functions.As the most common modification of sialic acids found in mammalian cell surface sialoglycoconjugates, 9-O-acetylation and de-O-acetylation play an important role in the transition of antigenicity and transformation of intercellular cross-talk. 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids can mask some epitopes. For example, natural ligands of the B-cell adhesion molecule CD22 beta can be masked by 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids",
