The Difficult Airway Algorithm was developed by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) in 1993. 1 As mentioned above, many alternative methods have been invented for management of airway crisis, including evolutional videolaryngoscope and laryngeal mask airway (LMA), etc. The Difficult Airway Algorithm was updated and published in 2003. [2] [3] [4] However, after brief investigation, we found that the new guidelines were not well known and popularized, especially among nurse anesthetists. Furthermore, most of them had no notion of how to assist the doctor during a specific procedure, such as fiberoptic intubation (FOI) through LMA, and there was no renewal airway management protocol for nurse anesthetists.",

Furthermore, the importance of optimal airway management and protection of health care personnel is greatly appreciated after the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in many countries. 12 In a case of unanticipated difficult intubation, we performed FOI through LMA. The images of the whole procedure were displayed on a monitor through the video adapter and the video processor assembly. We found unexpectedly that the display of real-time images could be greatly appreciated in teaching imageguided airway management.

We hypothesized that experience was a key requirement to developing requisite skills, and that they could easily understand and realize the improvements in the practice guidelines and the procedures during specific techniques after lecture and medical simulation. In order to be viewed by every participant, we situated the simulator on the stage of a big conference room and simulated the scenarios with multimedia images. By the means of real-time multimedia display on the 3-frame screen, participants could clearly watch the images of video camera, FOB or videolaryngoscope, ongoing frames of scenarios and steps of procedures, and responsive physical parameters. From the results and questionnaires, we found multimedia simulation to be of worth for trainees who have experience in airway management. By real-time multimedia simulation, most of the trainees knew how to provide assistance during a specific procedure.",

Unlike participant-based medical simulation, we designed this instructor-based medical simulation of 4 different scenarios focused on anticipated and unanticipated airway crises. In other words, each of the scenarios was simulated and conducted by the instructors. During most difficult airway management, the nurse anesthetists play the role of assistant. During the simulations, instructors of both anesthesiologists and nurse anesthetists demonstrated successful management including accurate decision-making and techniques, preparation of equipment, proper cooperation between anesthesiologists and nurse anesthetists. Most of the participants agreed that the instructor-based simulation was useful and practical, and they gained more confidence in clinical practice afterwards. The questionnaires also revealed that instructor-based simulation training was perceived by trainees to be more enjoyable and beneficial.",
