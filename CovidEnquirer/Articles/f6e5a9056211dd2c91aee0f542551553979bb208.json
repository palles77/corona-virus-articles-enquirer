Monoclonal antibodies to both the F and G protein neutralize infectivity in vitro, but while the majority of monoclonal antibodies to F neutralize virus, only a small proportion of G monoclonal antibodies do so. Two antigenic subgroups of RS virus, denoted A and B, have been recognized primarily due to differences in the G glycoprotein between subgroup A and B. Both subgroups circulate in the population, with some indication of a general predominance of one or the other in alternate years. It has been suggested that infections with subgroup A viruses may be somewhat more severe, with a greater frequency of hospitalizations with RS virus in years in which subgroup A viruses predominate compared to subgroup B.",

In addition, rhinoviruses replicate most efficiently in cell culture at lower than body temperature. Humans are the only known natural host. To date, over 100 distinct neutralization serotypes of rhinovirus have been identified. This antigenic diversity is the result of amino acid sequence variation in four recognized antigenic sites, which surround the receptor binding site. The majority of human rhinoviruses utilize intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) as the receptor. This \"major binding group\" accounts for 91 of 102 known rhinovirus serotypes.

Data from the United States, collected in the 1992 National Health Interview Survey, suggest that such illnesses are experienced at a rate of 85.6 illnesses per 100 persons per year, and account for 54% of all acute conditions exclusive of injuries. In the national morbidity survey in England and Wales conducted in general practice in 1991/92, acute respiratory infections accounted for 14% of all consultations and approximately 25% of the entire population consulted at least once in the survey year because of acute respiratory infection: in pre-school children these figures were 28% and 60% respectively. From a clinical perspective, the distinction between upper and lower respiratory illness is particularly important because the potential for complications is higher and more serious in lower respiratory disease. Nevertheless, some complications of upper respiratory illness can be serious, for example, acute sinusitis. Damage to the cells lining the lower respiratory tract results in impairment of the oxygenation of the blood and thus persons with pre-existing respiratory or cardiac disease are at particular risk from such infections.",

Differentiation between viral and bacterial forms of pneumonia in children on clinical grounds can be difficult, and radiologic criteria do not always distinguish these entities well. However, in normal infants and children with RS or parainfluenza virus pneumonia, bacteria do not appear to play an important role, and routine addition of antibacterial agents is not useful. The exception to this observation is in developing countries, where mixed viral and bacterial pneumonias in children are frequent and severe.",

The specific types of cells used depends on the spectrum of viruses being sought, and will vary both with the specific clinical situation and the season during which the cultures are obtained. For example, a laboratory might routinely inoculate respiratory cultures into Hep-2, RhMK, and MRC-5 cells year round, and add LLC-MK2 cells for isolation of parainfluenza viruses for cultures obtained during the spring and fall, while adding MDCK cells to facilitate isolation of influenza viruses during the winter months. Viral culture is highly sensitive and specific, and also has the advantage that after isolation the virus is available for further characterization. However, under the best of circum-stances, the results of such tests are not available during the time when decisions regarding management and therapy of an individual case must be made.

Viruses resistant to the in vitro antiviral activity of these agents have been isolated after passage in ceU culture [19] . Analysis of these viruses has revealed two basic mechanisms of resistance, and illustrate the interactive roles of the viral HA and NA in binding to and release from infected cells. Mutations within the catalytic framework of the NA which abolish binding of the drugs have been described. Resistance mutations in the NA may be associated with altered characteristics of the enzyme with significantly reduced activity. A second type of mutation associated with cell culture resistant viruses involve mutations in the receptor binding region of the hemagglutinin. HA mutations associated with resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors reduce the affinity of the HA for its receptor, allowing cell to cell spread of virus in the absence of NA activity. Resistant viruses with HA mutations exhibit cross resistance to these drugs in cell culture, but may retain susceptibility in animal models. Many of these viruses also exhibit reduced virulence in animals. However, resistant viruses have been rarely isolated from humans treated with neuraminidase inhibitors in clinical trials to date [30] . The most well characterized resistant virus reported so far was recovered from an immunosuppressed child receiving Zanamivir [31] . Preliminary results from clinical trials in immunologically intact individuals suggest that resistant viruses arise very infrequently during treatment.",

This poses a significant hurdle to the effective use of antiviral therapy for influenza, in that patients must correctly identify their illness, seek medical attention, interact with the medical system and achieve some form of diagnosis, and be prescribed and obtain drug within a very short time frame. For physicians, the issue may balance on the level of comfort in making a clinical diagnosis of influenza, since it may not be practical to confirm each case microbiologically, at the current state of technology. Certainly the evidence from randomized trials of neuraminidase inhibitors suggest that with appropriate epidemiologic support, a clinical diagnosis of influenza can be made with some confidence, since in these trials subjects who met a clinical case definition had a 60-70% rate of microbiologically documented influenza. Individual physician practices therefore will need to adapt the strategies that best suit their patient populations.",

Similarly, it is reasonable to imagine that severely ill patients who are virus positive at the time that therapy is initiated might benefit even if they more than 48 hours into their illness.

In one recent randomized placebo controlled trial in an elderly population, inactivated vaccine was approximately 58% effective in preventing laboratory documented influenza [62] . In addition, numerous retrospective case-control studies are available which have documented the effectiveness of inactivated influenza vaccines in these individuals. A recent meta-analysis of published cohort observational trials derived a very similar estimate of 56% for the level of vaccine efficacy against influenza respiratory illness in the elderly [63] . Vaccine is protective against influenza and pneumonia related hospitalization in the elderly, and is even accompanied by a decrease in all-cause mortality [64] . A recently conducted Medicare demonstration project indicated that vaccine usage had a beneficial effect on reduction of hospital admissions associated with laboratory-documented influenza A or B infection [65] . It has been estimated that among elderly persons in the US, influenza vaccination is associated with a direct savings of $117 per year per person vaccinated [66] . It has also been suggested that vaccination of staff in chronic care facilities can have a major impact on mortality in elderly residents of these institutions [67] .",

The currently recommended target groups for influenza vaccination are summarized in Table 5 . Specific recommendations regarding target groups are reviewed each year and updated [89] . Additional individuals in whom vaccination is recommended include individuals such as health care workers, who can transmit virus to others at high risk, individuals infected with HIV, and high-risk individuals who will be traveling to an area where influenza epidemics are occurring. While it is relatively easy to identify such individuals, it is not always easy to deliver vaccine to them. Rates of influenza immunization in individuals 65 and older in the U.S. have risen dramatically, and now exceed the 60% \"healthy people 2000\" goal in all 50 states. However, the vaccine coverage rate in high-risk individuals under 65 is considerably lower, estimated to be approximately 30% to 35%. Antiviral drugs could also be considered for prevention in certain limited circumstances. At the moment, only amantadine and rimantadine are licensed for the prevention of influenza, so that currently licensed antiviral strategies currently would be effective only for prevention of influenza A. In, individuals are administered the antiviral drug for the duration of potential exposure. As reviewed earlier, the seasonal prophylaxis strategy has been the basis for multiple clinical trials demonstrating the prophylactic activity of the M2 and neuraminidase inhibitors. In this is fairly obviously not a practical solution for the general use, but seasonal prophylaxis should be considered in particularly high-risk individuals who cannot be vaccinated or would not be expected to respond to vaccination at all. In addition, seasonal prophylaxis would be one method of dealing with a situation in which the vaccine did not include the prevalent epidemic strain, such as during a pandemic. However, there might be expected to be significant logistic and supply difficulties with the use of antiviral prophylaxis on such a large scale.",

            "text": "Antiviral drugs can also be used for short-term prevention. One scenario is the individual who is not vaccinated until influenza epidemic activity has already begun. Under these circumstances, it is reasonable to use antivirals until vaccine immunity has been established. Because immunity develops quite rapidly following inactivated vaccine in adults, generally 2 weeks of prophylaxis after vaccination is recommended. The other form of short-term prophylaxis that is commonly employed is after exposure, either in the family or institutional setting. As described above, there is good evidence to support the effectiveness of a 7-10 day administration of antivirals to contacts after a family member develops acute influenza. For the most part, this strategy would be appropriate in the setting of a high-risk individual within the family, but under unusual circumstances (e.g., a vacation or other important life event) such a strategy could be considered in healthy persons. Because of the possibility of generation and transmission of resistant influenza viruses, the success of this strategy when M2 inhibitors are utilized depends on not also using M2 inhibitors to treat the index case. It is not clear whether such a proscription would be important for neuraminidase inhibitors as well.",

            "text": "The more common use of short term prophylaxis is after potential exposure in the institutional setting. In this situation, the recipients have generally already been vaccinated, but constitute a group in whom vaccine efficacy may not be ideal, and in whom the potential consequences of influenza demand that every additional effort be taken to prevent infection. There is surprisingly little placebo-controlled data to support the use of outbreak-initiated prophylaxis with any antiviral, but the experience with family studies and various anecdotal reports suggest that there may be some benefit to this approach. If outbreak initiated prophylaxis is to be used, it is essential that it be instituted promptly to be most effective, since influenza can spread rapidly in the institutional setting, and the peak of the outbreak may occur only a few days after recognition of the index case. Therefore, programs that utilize standing orders are generally more successful. Rapid diagnostic tests for detection of influenza may also be quite useful in this regard, since the clinical presentation of influenza in this population can be muted and difficult to differentiate from other respiratory viruses such as RSV and rhinovirus. Although these tests may have lower sensitivity than culture, the aggregate sensitivity in detecting at least one positive out of several samples should be adequate to allow early recognition and response to influenza outbreaks. For any individual outbreak, the recommended duration of prophylaxis is from 2 to 3 weeks, or for one week beyond the last documented case. For the same reasons as described for family prophylaxis, isolation of individuals receiving treatment with M2 inhibitors from individuals receiving prophylaxis with M2 inhibitors is important to reduce the generation and spread of resistant viruses. Alternatively, one could consider treatment with one class of agent (e.g., neuraminidase inhibitors) and prophylaxis with the other class (e.g. M2 inhibitors).",

This strategy is based on early observations that passively transferred antibody to either the F or G protein prevented infection in experimental animals and was also effective therapeutically. Although therapeutic administration of antibody has not resulted in clinical benefit in humans [90] , prophylaxis with passive antibody has been successful in selected infants. Initial studies utilized selected pools of immunoglobulin screened for high titers of RS virus neutralizing antibody, referred to as RSV-IGIV (RespiGam) [91] . When administered intravenously at monthly intervals during RSV seasonal activity, RSV-IGIV was shown to reduce the incidence of RSV-related respiratory hospitalizations in infants with prematurity or bronchopulmonary dysplasia [92, 93] . The currently recommended dose of RSV-IVIG is 750 mg/kg IV monthly during the RSV season. However, administration of this agent involves administration of large volumes of fluid, and children with cyanotic congenital heart disease who received RSV-IGIV had a higher incidence of severe adverse events, and those that went on to have cardiac surgery had enhanced mortality [94] . Thus, this product is considered to be contraindicated in infants with cyanotic congenital heart disease [45] .",
