The development of a drug with broad-spectrum HCoV inhibitory activity would address this urgent unmet medical need. Although previous studies have suggested that the HR1 of HCoV spike (S) protein is an important target site for inhibition against specific HCoVs, whether this conserved region could serve as a target for the development of broad-spectrum pan-CoV inhibitor remains controversial. Here, we found that peptide OC43-HR2P, derived from the HR2 domain of HCoV-OC43, exhibited broad fusion inhibitory activity against multiple HCoVs. EK1, the optimized form of OC43-HR2P, showed substantially improved pan-CoV fusion inhibitory activity and pharmaceutical properties. Crystal structures indicated that EK1 can form a stable six-helix bundle structure with both short \uf061-HCoV and long \uf062-HCoV HR1s, further supporting the role of HR1 region as a viable pan-CoV target site.",

In 2002, SARS-CoV infections first appeared in China and then quickly spread as a global epidemic in more than 30 countries with 8273 infections and 775 deaths (nearly 10% mortality) (2) . In 2012, MERS-CoV emerged in Saudi Arabia and spread throughout the Middle East. In 2015, the second pandemic of MERS-CoV occurred in South Korea, causing super-spreading events with third-and fourth-generation cases of infection. The World Health Organization has reported 2229 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 791 deaths (about 35% case fatality) in 27 countries as of August 2018 (www.who.int/emergencies/ mers-cov/en/). Meanwhile, the remaining common HCoVs, such as 229E, OC43, and NL63, usually infect the human upper respiratory tract and cause the common cold, but they also are responsible for severe and even fatal diseases in children, elderly, and immunocompromised patients (3) (4) (5) . These scenarios suggest that those common HCoVs might also pose a lethal threat to humans. Note that HCoVs are rapidly evolving. OC43 isolates with novel genomes are being continuously identified (6) (7) (8) .",

Recent studies identified some types of SL-CoV, such as SL-WIV1-CoV and SL-SHC014-CoV, whose spike (S) proteins highly resemble those of SARS-CoV. These SL-CoVs could use the same SARS-CoV receptor, i.e., angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), to directly enter permissive human cells without need for adaptation (9) (10) (11) . In addition, the ML-CoV, Tylonycteris bat CoV HKU4, was shown to recognize the MERS-CoV receptor CD26 and infect human cells either after introduction of two single mutations (S746R and N762A) into its S protein or with the help of exogenous protease (12, 13) . From a historical perspective, zoonotic CoVs harbor a strong ability to cross species barriers to infect humans rapidly and unpredictably, as illustrated by newly emerging HCoVs (2, 14) . Thus, developing a specific drug that only targets a single HCoV would be ineffective against newly emerging HCoVs (9) (10) (11) . Since no broad-spectrum anti-HCoV drug is currently available for clinical use, it is incumbent to search for a common or conserved target site based on existing HCoVs.",

            "text": "The S glycoprotein is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that plays an important role in mediating viral infection and is common to all HCoVs. The S proteins consist of two subunits, S1 and S2 (Fig. 1B) . The S1 subunit binds the cellular receptor through its receptor-binding domain (RBD), followed by conformational changes in the S2 subunit, which allows the fusion peptide to insert into the host target cell membrane. The heptad repeat 1 (HR1) region in the S2 subunit forms a homotrimeric assembly, which exposes three highly conserved hydrophobic grooves on the surface that bind heptad repeat 2 (HR2). This six-helix bundle (6-HB) core structure is formed during the fusion process and helps bring the viral and cellular membranes into close proximity for viral fusion and entry ( Fig. 1B) (15) . Thus, the S protein is an important target protein for the development of specific drugs. In particular, the S1 RBD is a very good target site, and both RBD-specific antibodies and RBD-based vaccines have previously exhibited effective antiviral activity or protective effect in blocking binding of virus to host receptors (16) . However, from an evolutionary perspective, the RBD of CoV is part of a highly mutable region and, thus, is not an ideal target site for broadspectrum antiviral inhibitor development (14) . The SARS-CoV RBDspecific antibody fm6 failed to block infection mediated by the S protein of SL-CoV-SHC014 (9) (10) (11) 17) . In contrast, the HR region in the S2 subunit is conserved among various HCoVs and plays a pivotal role in HCoV infections by forming the 6-HB that mediates viral fusion (fig. S1A). Furthermore, the mode of interaction between HR1 and HR2 is conserved among CoVs such that residues located at the \"e\" and \"g\" positions in the HR1 helices interact with residues at the \"a\" and \"d\" positions in the HR2 helices (fig. S1B) (18) . Previous studies have reported that peptides derived from the HR2 (or C-terminal HR) region of class I viral fusion proteins from some enveloped viruses, including HIV-1 (19) (20) (21) , respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (22) , Ebola virus (23) , paramyxoviruses SV5 (24) , Nipah virus (25) , and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) (26) , could competitively bind the viral HR1 (or N-terminal HR) and effectively inhibit viral infection. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that HR1 could also be a good target for the development of fusion inhibitors against highly pathogenic HCoVs.",

For example, the peptide CP-1, derived from the SARS-CoV spike protein HR2 region, was able to inhibit SARS-CoV entry in a manner similar to that of MERS-HR2P against MERS-CoV infection (18, 27) . However, we note that those peptides lack broad-spectrum antiviral activity against heterologous HCoVs. For example, CP-1 and MERS-HR2P peptides failed to cross-inhibit MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection, respectively. Furthermore, the CoV fusion core HR regions can be divided into two groups (28, 29) : short HRs, such as MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and OC43 HRs; and long HRs, such as 229E and NL63 HRs. The difference between short and long HRs arises from an insertion of 14 amino acids in the long HRs, further increasing the difficulty in designing broad-spectrum peptide fusion inhibitors. To address this challenge, we herein report the successful screening of a peptide OC43-HR2P with broad-spectrum fusion inhibitory activity. Furthermore, a modified OC43-HR2P peptide, EK1, shows promising potency and breadth in inhibiting infection by multiple HCoVs. In vivo studies demonstrate that administration of EK1 via the nasal route exhibits highly protective effects and safety profiles, highlighting its clinical potential. Moreover, structural studies of EK1 in complex with HR1s from different HCoVs explain the conserved basis for the HR1-EK1 interaction, further indicating that HR1 region could serve as a promising target site for the development of broad-spectrum pan-CoV fusion inhibitors.",

            "text": "To systematically assess the inhibitory activities of these peptides against different HCoVs, we developed multiple cell-cell fusion assays that were mediated by the S protein of various HCoVs (fig. S1D). Consistent with previous results, MERS-HR2P had inhibitory activity against cell-cell fusion mediated by MERS-CoV S protein with a concentration for 50% inhibition (IC 50 ) of 1.01 \uf06dM, whereas it showed little inhibitory activity in other HCoV S-mediated cellcell fusion assays even with concentrations up to 5 \uf06dM ( Fig. 1D and table S1). Similarly, SARS-HR2P specifically inhibited SARS-CoV S-mediated cell-cell fusion with an IC 50 of 0.52 \uf06dM. On the other hand, HR2P peptides derived from the two \uf061-HCoVs, i.e., 229E and NL63, showed potent and broad inhibitory activity against \uf061-HCoV S-mediated cell-cell fusion with IC 50 values ranging from 0.13 to 0.51 \uf06dM or from 0.21 to 0.56 \uf06dM, respectively, but no effective inhibitory activity against \uf062-HCoVs (including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and OC43) S-mediated fusion ( Fig. 1D and table S1 ). OC43-HR2P exhibited broad and potent fusion inhibitory activity with IC 50 values of 0.39, 0.54, and 0.66 \uf06dM against MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and OC43, respectively ( Fig. 1D and table S1 ). Unexpectedly, OC43-HR2P, a \uf062-HCoV HR2-derived peptide, and thus 14 residues shorter than 229E-HR2P and NL63-HR2P, exhibited effective activity against \uf061-HCoVs with an IC 50 of 0.84 \uf06dM on 229E-S-mediated cell-cell fusion and an IC 50 of 0.94 \uf06dM on NL63-S-mediated cell-cell fusion. Among all HR1Ps, only 229E-HR1P exhibited moderate inhibitory effects on 229E-S-and NL63-S-mediated cell-cell fusion (Fig. 1D) . Thus, compared to HR1Ps, all HCoV HR2-derived peptides exhibited excellent self-specific fusion inhibitory activity, whereas OC43-HR2P showed broad-spectrum and potent fusion inhibitory activity against both \uf061-HCoV and \uf062-HCoV S-mediated cell-cell fusion ( Fig. 1D and table S1 ). We also measured the \uf061-helicity of OC43-HR2P and HCoV-HR1Ps by circular dichroism and found that the peptides alone exhibited limited \uf061-helicity ranging from 11.3 to 42.3% ( fig. S1E ). In contrast, the mixtures of OC43-HR2P and each of these HR1 peptides, respectively, exhibited high \uf061-helicity (70.9 to 86.7%) with melting transition temperature (T m ) values that ranged from 48.5\u00b0 to 91.5\u00b0C ( fig. S1E ), further implying that OC43-HR2P can bind HR1s of different HCoVs and form stable complexes, thereby blocking S protein-mediated fusion.",

            "text": "It was previously reported that introduction of negatively and positively charged amino acids Glu (E) and Lys (K), at the i to i + 3 or i to i + 4 positions in a helix, into an HIV-1 fusion inhibitory peptide can form intramolecular E-K or K-E salt bridges that result in substantial enhancement of the peptide's stability, solubility, and antiviral activity (30, 31) . Using a similar design, we further optimized the sequence of OC43-HR2P by introducing Glu or Lys at appropriate sites in the peptide to increase the solubility and thereby the antiviral activity of the peptide. Moreover, on the basis of the structure of MERS-CoV S 6-HB, we also introduced mutations at some sites that are not expected to be involved in HR1 binding, such as 4Q, 14Y, 32D, and 36L, to further enhance the fusion inhibitory activity of the peptide (table S2) . Among the series of optimized peptides, peptides EK0-1, EK0-2, EK0-3, and EK1 showed gradually increased solubility and excellent inhibitory activity in cell-cell fusion assays. The final peptide, EK1, exhibited the most potent pan-CoV antiviral fusion activity with IC 50 values in the range of 0.19 to 0.62 \uf06dM (table  S2) . In some HCoV cell-cell fusion assays, EK1 exhibited even more effective inhibitory activity than the autologous peptide, such as MERS-HR2P and SARS-HR2P. Akin to its ancestor OC43-HR2P, EK1, which is derived from the short 6-HB fusion core of OC43, was also able to potently inhibit the cell-cell fusion mediated by 229E and NL63 S proteins, both of which harbor the long fusion core. These results further underscore the broad-spectrum anti-HCoV potential of EK1 (Fig. 2 , A to E, and table S2). Furthermore, EK1 also had superior pharmaceutical properties and solubility in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) and water, which increased by 478-fold and 3.5-fold, respectively, as compared to the original OC43-HR2P. Together, these results establish an important framework and platform for subsequent development of EK1 as a potential therapeutic (table S2) .",

Notably, many studies have suggested diversity in the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of SL-CoV's RBD (9-11), which plays an important role in binding the cellular receptor and serves as an effective target site for the development of CoV-specific antibodies or vaccines (32) . Specifically, the RBM of SHC014 CoV has only 80% similarity and 64% identity to that of SARS-CoV, and an antibody targeting the SARS-CoV RBD could not prevent infection mediated by the SHC014 S protein (9) (10) (11) 17) . In contrast, the HR1 and HR2 sequences of SL-CoV are 100% identical to those of SARS-CoV ( fig. S2B ). Correspondingly, EK1 exhibited greater inhibitory activity than the autologous peptide SARS-HR2P against cell-cell fusion mediated by the S protein of the three SL-CoVs tested (Fig. 2 , F to H), while an EK1-scrambled peptide showed no inhibitory activity on cell-cell fusion mediated by any of these CoV S proteins (Fig. 2, A to H) .",

We also used here pseudovirus assays to assess the inhibitory activity of EK1 against different pseudotyped HCoVs. In a MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection assay, both EK1 and MERS-HR2P showed inhibitory activity with IC 50 values of 0.26 and 1.06 \uf06dM, respectively (Fig. 2I) (Fig. 2, N and O) . In contrast, EK1 exhibited no inhibitory activity against VSV-G-mediated viral infection (Fig. 2P) . The EK1-scrambled peptide showed no inhibitory activity on infection by any of these pseudoviruses (Fig. 2 , I to P). As previously reported (10), we failed to assemble a pseudotyped SHC014 and thus did not perform pseudovirus infection assays on this virus. Collectively, pseudovirus infection by all HCoVs and SL-CoVs could be efficiently blocked by EK1, further indicating that EK1 has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against infection by pan-HCoVs, including \uf061-HCoVs, \uf062-HCoVs, and SL-CoVs.",

Compared with those from PBS-treated mice, the lungs obtained from Cy5-EK1-treated mice exhibited significantly higher fluorescence signals (P < 0.0001, n = 3) (Fig. 3 , C and D). Together, these results suggest that EK1 (intranasal) can widely be distributed in the whole respiratory tract and be enriched in the lung. We also noted that Cy5-EK1 administered intranasally could be detected in significant amounts in several extrapulmonary organs, including the liver, kidney, and spleen, in some animals, suggesting that EK1 could enter into the blood circulation and other organs (fig. S3, A and B). This observation suggests that intranasal administration of EK1 could also be beneficial for multiorgan infection or systemic infection of HCoVs, both of which are common in MERS-CoV infection.",

Body weight of mice in the viral control group decreased, starting from 5 days postinfection (dpi), and mice succumbed to infection by 10 dpi with 100% mortality (Fig. 3 , E to G).

Meanwhile, we tested the viral titers in brains of mice of all groups at 5 dpi. Infectious virus was readily detectable in the viral control group, whereas infectious virus titers were below the limit of detection (2 log TCID 50 /g) in the EK1 prophylactic mice or very low in the EK1 therapeutic mice (Fig. 3G) . However, the infectious virus titers in the brains of mice that died during EK1 therapeutic treatment were as high as those in the brains of viral control mice without EK1 treatment, while the viral titers in the brains of survival mice with EK1 therapeutic treatment and in those of normal control mice were both undetectable ( fig. S2E ). Consistently, the brains of mice that died during EK1 therapeutic treatment exhibited similar histopathological changes as those of the viral control mice, i.e., similar amount of vacuolation, degeneration, and infiltration ( fig.

In contrast, the survival rates in the EK1 prophylactic and therapeutic groups were 100 and 75%, respectively ( Fig. 3 , H to J). When the yield of infectious viruses in lungs was used as the end point for assessing the efficacy of EK-1 on MERS-CoV infection, we were unable to recover any infectious virus from both EK1 prophylactic and therapeutic groups, in sharp contrast to the untreated controls (Fig. 3J ). Together, these results indicated that the peptide EK1 has broad and potent prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy against HCoV infections.",

EK1 is not cytotoxic at concentrations up to 1 mM, which is more than 200 times higher than its IC 50 for inhibiting any HCoV S-mediated cell-cell fusion and pseudovirus entry ( fig. S3C ). We then further investigated its cytotoxicity in vivo. We continuously administered mice with PBS, low-dose EK1 (20 mg/kg), or high-dose EK1 (100 mg/kg) by intranasal route every day for 1 week, and we recorded the body weight changes for the following 2 weeks ( fig. S3D ). The EK1-treated mice in both high-and low-dose groups lived normally, with no apparent difference in weight gain/loss observed as compared to PBS-treated mice. Meanwhile, we used enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure EK1-specific antibodies in sera of mice 2 weeks after intranasal administration. No EK1-specific antibodies were detected in either the EK1treated group or in the PBS-treated group ( fig. S3E ).",

            "text": "To investigate the structural basis for the pan-CoV inhibitory effect of EK1 peptide, we crystallized EK1 in complex with HR1 peptides from three representative HCoVs, including the most pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in \uf062-HCoVs and 229E in \uf061-HCoVs, the HR1 of which is 14 amino acids longer than those of \uf062-HCoVs. (table S3) . In all three structures, EK1 snugly fits into the hydrophobic groove formed between two adjacent HR1 helices in an oblique and antiparallel manner (Fig. 4 , A to C), producing a 6-HB structure resembling the 3HR1-3HR2 postfusion state of corresponding HCoVs ( fig. S4) . Notably, the binding sites of EK1 coincide with those of native HR2s (fig. S4 ). These results indicate that the presence of EK1 would preclude binding of HR2 onto their corresponding 3HR1 core, thereby blocking formation of the 3HR1-3HR2 6-HB, which is an indispensable step during host-viral membrane fusion. Hence, administration of the EK1 peptide would block cellular entry of those HCoVs (Fig. 2) . In all three structures, the EK1 peptide adopts a mixed secondary structure conformation (Fig. 4 , A to C). The central region of EK1 folds into a five-turn helix, which packs against two neighboring HR1 helices via extensive hydrophobic interactions (3HR1 cores of different HCoVs are illustrated as electrostatic surfaces, while residues on EK1 that are involved in hydrophobic packing are shown as stick models; residues L12, E15, M16, L19, A22, I23, L26, S29, and Y30 on EK1 locate within the five-turn helix of EK1 and form strong hydrophobic interactions with the 3HR1 cores; Fig. 5A ) and a few electrostatic or polar interactions (residues E13, E15, K18, E20, E27, E28, and Y30 locate within the five-turn helix region of EK1 and interact with HR1 residues through side chain-to-side chain hydrophilic interactions; Fig. 6A ). The rest of EK1 adopts an extended conformation, except that one extra turn is formed at the C-terminal end of EK1 (around E35) in the HR1(229E)-L6-EK1 structure (Fig. 6 , right panel). In the extended region of EK1, polar interactions between side chain (HR1 residues) and main chain (EK1 residues) dominate (compare Fig. 6, B and A) . Most of these side chain-to-main chain polar interactions cluster at either end of the EK1 helical region, which interweave into extensive H-bond networks and likely help secure the EK1 helical region in the correct register (Fig. 6B) . Hydrophobic residues in the extended region of EK1 also insert their bulky side chains into hydrophobic pockets on the surface of the 3HR1 cores (residues L2, I5, V7, L10, I31, and L36; Fig. 5A ), further strengthening the adhesion of the EK1 extended region onto the 3HR1 cores.",

Notwithstanding, the RBD of the S protein has been proposed as a promising target for the develop-ment of specific antibodies and vaccines (39, 40) . For example, the RBD-specific antibody CDC2-C2 exhibits inhibitory activity against MERS-CoV infection. Nevertheless, administration of the single-antibody CDC2-C2 could result in the emergence of escape mutations in MERS-CoV RBD (41) . Unfortunately, the CoV S RBD is hypervariable throughout evolution, which has led to marked difference in host receptor usage in different HCoVs. Even when the same host receptor is used by different HCoVs, they frequently target different binding sites on the host receptor (42) . Therefore, specific RBD-targeting antibodies or vaccines inevitably lack broad-spectrum activity against HCoV infection. For example, Menachery et al. (9) found that a SARS-CoV RBD-specific antibody could not protect mice from infection by the chimeric virus with the SHC014 S proteins, although SHC014 has high homology with SARS-CoV and can bind the same host receptor ACE2. The lag time between emerging human CoV outbreaks and development of new prophylactic treatments or vaccines is of concern. Thus, there is an urgent need for the development of new, broad-spectrum drugs that target conserved sites in currently circulating and future emerging HCoVs so as to prepare for future outbreaks of yet unknown HCoVs.",

Subsequently, numerous virus fusion inhibitory peptides overlapping the HR2 sequences of class I membrane fusion proteins from other enveloped viruses, including RSV (22) , Ebola virus (23), paramyxoviruses SV5 (24), and Nipah virus (25) , were also reported. In 2003, Bosch et al. (26) discovered that a soluble HR2 peptide derived from the MHV S protein HR2 region inhibited virus cell entry, suggesting that the S glycoprotein of CoV is a class I fusogen with the ability to form 6-HB during the S protein-mediated membrane fusion process. In 2004, the Bosch (43) and Jiang (18) groups independently reported that peptides derived from the HR2 region of SARS-CoV S protein could interact with the peptides from its HR1 region to form 6-HB and inhibited SARS-CoV S protein-mediated membrane fusion and SARS-CoV infection with moderate potency. In 2014, Lu et al. (27) reported that peptide derived from the MERS-CoV S-HR2 could competitively inhibit 6-HB formation, thereby preventing fusion of the virus with host cells.",

Thus, it was unclear whether 6-HB was a good target site for the development of a broad-spectrum anti-HCoV inhibitor. To identify a pan-HCoV fusion inhibition target site and preferably also to develop a potential pan-HCoV inhibitor against infection of multiple HCoVs in the human respiratory tract, we successfully established multiple HCoV S-mediated cell-cell fusion assays to determine the cross-inhibitory spectrum between HR1Ps and HR2Ps, which are derived from the HR1 and HR2, respectively, of HCoVs. Unexpectedly, we found that OC43-HR2P harbored broad-spectrum binding activity to all HR1Ps and manifested fusion inhibitory activity against all HCoV S-mediated cell-cell fusion. We then further optimized the OC43-HR2P to improve its antiviral activity and solubility. The optimized peptide EK1 exhibited broad and potent fusion inhibitory activity against infection by HCoVs and SL-CoVs on various in vitro models, i.e., cell-cell fusion assays and pseudotyped or live viral infection assays. We assessed the prophylactic and protective effects of EK1 through intranasal administration on OC43 and MERS-CoV mouse models. EK1 exhibited effective preventive and protective effects in these mouse models with an acceptable in vivo safety profile. Furthermore, the in vivo pharmacokinetic profiling and safety studies helped us acquire useful data for potential human clinical trials in the future.",

For example, anti-HIV-1 peptide T20 is about 900-fold more potent than the anti-SARS-CoV peptide SC-1, yet only 30-fold more potent than the anti-MERS-CoV peptide HR2P (18, 27, 44) . It is known that HIV-1 and SARS-CoV each enter their target cells mainly through plasma and endosomal membrane fusion, respectively, while MERS-CoV could infect its target cells via both plasma and endosomal membrane fusion (18, 27, 44) . The vast differences seen in potency thus suggest that only a limited number of the EK1 peptides can get into the endosome to inhibit virus-cell fusion. Therefore, increasing the cell permeability of the fusion inhibitory peptides is expected to enhance the potency of these peptides. We have recently reported that addition of hydrocarbon stapling or a palmitic acid group (C16) to the MERS-CoV fusion inhibitory peptides significantly improves their antiviral potency and pharmacokinetic properties (45, 46) . In the near future, we will use the similar approaches to improving the antiviral activity of EK1.",

Side chains of EK1 and HR1 residues involved in these interactions are shown as cyan and gray stick models, respectively, and are similarly color-coded. At least four pairs of this hydrophilic interaction are conserved across different EK1-HR1 complexes: Y30 EK1 forms similar polar interactions with Q1009 MERS (left), Q917 SARS (middle), or T817 229E (right); E27 EK1 forms similar polar interactions with Q1009 MERS (left), Q917 SARS (middle), or S820 229E (right); E15 EK1 forms salt bridges with K1021 MERS (left), K929 SARS (middle), or K832 229E (right); and T8 EK1 makes similar interactions with N1028 MERS (left), Q936 SARS (middle), or Q839 229E (right).

Consistent with previous studies (9, 11) , we herein also failed to establish a SHC014 pseudovirus using an HIV-1 backbone vector; therefore, we assessed the antiviral effect of EK1 only on WIV1 and Rs3367 pseudovirus infection and found that EK1 exhibited effective inhibitory activity against these two SL-CoVs. In addition, some animal CoVs within the CoV family are very close to HCoV, such as bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and MHV.

Although most residues that mediated hydrophobic (shaded orange and yellow) and side chain-to-side chain hydrophilic interactions (boxed in cyan) are conserved between EK1 and different HR2s, sequence variability does exist at positions V7, Y30, and some other ridge-packing residues ( fig. S7A ). We thus focused our analysis on these residues and their surrounding environments in different HCoVs' 3HR1 cores. In both solved structures of MERS(HR1)-EK1 and SARS(HR1)-EK1, V7 EK1 fits its side chain neatly into the hydrophobic pockets on these two 3HR1 cores ( fig. S7B, second and fourth panels) . Nevertheless, in the previously reported structure of the SARS-CoV fusion core, A1156 SARS , the equivalent of V7 EK1 in SARS-CoV, would occupy the same cavity loosely ( fig. S7B, third panel) , while T1257 MERS , the equivalent of V7 EK1 in MERS-CoV, could not fully bury its side chain owing to the polar nature of the Thr residue ( fig. S7B, first  panel) . Thus, Val, in EK1 and OC43-HR2, is more effective in fitting the hydrophobic cavities at this position than Ala (seen in SARS-HR2) or Thr (seen in MERS-HR2) ( fig. S7B ).",

At this position, the polar pair \"Ser-Tyr\" in EK1 and OC43-HR2 appears to be more suitable than the \"Ser-Leu\" pair from SARS-HR2 in accommodating the opposite electrostatic environments in different HCoVs.

            "text": "In its natural state, the S protein that is present on the CoV surface is inactive. After receptor binding target cell proteases activate the S protein by cleaving the exposed enzyme target sites, leaving the S2 subunit free to mediate viral fusion and entry. CoV can enter the target cell via two pathways: one is the endocytosis pathway and the other is direct fusion on the cellular surface. For example, when SARS-CoV enters the target cell through the endocytosis pathway, its S protein can be cleaved and activated by the pH-dependent cysteine protease cathepsin L in the endosome. On the other hand, recent studies have consistently reported that the SARS-CoV S protein can also be cleaved and activated by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and human airway trypsin-like protease, which are located on the cell surface, thus activating and allowing the S protein to mediate SARS-CoV infection at the plasma membrane (9) (10) (11) . In accord with such a finding, Matsuyama et al. (47) reported that the HR2 peptide efficiently inhibited SARS-CoV entry into cells, while lysosome-tropic reagents failed to inhibit at all. Similarly, TMPRSS2 also has the capacity to promote the entry of MERS-CoV through bypassing the endocytosis pathway and directly activating its S protein on the cellular surface (48) . Recently, several studies have reported that TMPRSS2 is highly expressed on human respiratory epithelial cells surface and was even associated with several CoV receptors, such as ACE2 and DPP4 (48) (49) (50) . Hence, the plasma membrane fusion pathway seems a preferred choice for HCoV infection in the human respiratory tract. Consistently, our previous study found that MERS-CoV-specific fusion inhibitor HR2PM2 effectively inhibited MERS-CoV infection in vivo by intranasal administration (33) . Other studies have also reported that the current clinical isolates of 229E and OC43 are very sensitive to cell surface TMRRSS2 but not to endosomal cathepsins (51, 52) . Overall, for current circulating HCoVs or emerging HCoVs, the cell surface fusion pathway in human respiratory tract would appear to be very important. Therefore, peptide fusion inhibitors and the strategy of intranasal administration are excellent choices for preventing HCoV infection via the airway, which is a key site for HCoV to rapidly establish infection and widely spread to other organs.",

The availability of HCoV-specific drugs with broad-spectrum inhibitory activity is therefore important for the prevention and control of a future HCoV epidemic. The EK1 fusion inhibitor peptide targeting the conserved site in the spike HR1, but not the hypervariable RBD region, has potent and broad inhibitory activity against multiple HCoV infections. EK1 through nasal administration exhibited effective and broadly anti-HCoV activity with a satisfactory safety profile in vivo. Hence, EK1 is a promising candidate for further development as an antiviral agent against infection of multiple HCoVs, especially for use in infants and the elderly, as well as immunocompromised patients, who would be more vulnerable to HCoV infections (53) (54) (55) (56) . Meanwhile, this study provides clues and methods for the development of peptide fusion inhibitors with potency and breadth in inhibiting infections by other highly pathogenic enveloped viruses with class I membrane fusion proteins, such as Ebola and Marburg viruses, Hendra and Nipah viruses, and influenza viruses. were preserved in our laboratory.

The resulting sequences encoding different HR1-L6-EK1 fusion proteins were then subcloned into a modified pET-28a vector, which contains a His 6 -SUMO tag upstream of the multiple cloning site. The resulting constructs, pET-28a-His 6 -SUMO-HR1-L6-EK1, were then expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) at 16\u00b0C overnight in LB medium. We initially purified these fusion proteins using His-Talon resin (Clontech). Eluted fractions from the His-Talon column were then mixed with Ulp1 enzyme [1:100 (w/w)] and dialyzed against buffer A [20 mM tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM dithiothreitol] at 4\u00b0C overnight. After SUMO tag cleavage, the samples were reloaded onto the His-Talon column, and flow-through fractions containing untagged HR1-L6-EK1 were pooled, concentrated, and gel-filtered in buffer B [20 mM tris (pH 8.0) and 150 mM NaCl] on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 (GE Healthcare) column.

For structure determination of HR1 (MERS)-L6-EK1 and HR1(229E)-L6-EK1, the MERS-CoV fusion core [PDB: 4mod] and SARS-CoV fusion core [PDB: 2bez] were used as search models. The structural models were further improved by cycles of manual building and refinement using the COOT (59) and PHENIX (58) programs. The quality of these models were analyzed with MolProbity (60) . A summary of the structure refinement statistics is also given in table S3.

Briefly, Huh-7 cells and ACE2-293 T cells were used as target cells for the entry of MERS-CoV Blam-Vpr virions and SARS-CoV Blam-Vpr virions, respectively. These target cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C for 5 hours in six-well plates (with virions containing BlaM-Vpr equivalent to 80 ng of p24-Gag per well) in the presence or absence of EK1 at the indicated concentrations. The cells were washed with PBS, resuspended in 500 \uf06dl of DMEM, and then incubated with CCF4-AM substrate at room temperature for 2 hours, as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen, Germany). Last, the cells were monitored via flow cytometry. After the virion fusion with the target cell, the CCF4-AM (emission at 520 nm) substrate could be cleaved by BlaM-Vpr into CCF4 (emission at 447 nm). Flow cytometric data were collected with a BD FACSDIVA and analyzed with FlowJo.",

While the advanced CPE of Calu-3 cells could develop within 24 to 36 hours in response to MERS-CoV infection at higher multiplicities of infection (MOIs) of 1 or 0.1 (69), we did not observe any prominent formation of CPE until ~ 60 to 72 hours after infection at an estimated MOI of ~ 0.001. Hence, to more accurately measure the efficacy of peptide inhibitors against MERS-CoV infection, we harvested the supernatants at 72 hours and quantified infectious virus titers by the standard Vero E6-based infectivity assays and expressed the titers as log 10 TCID 50 /ml.",

Consistent with the results from cell-cell fusion assays, both EK1 and SARS-HR2P inhibited pseudotyped Rs3367 virus infection with IC 50 values of 2.25 and 3.05 \uf06dM, respectively, and prevented WIV1 pseudovirus infection with IC 50 values of 2.10 and 2.73 \uf06dM, respectively",
