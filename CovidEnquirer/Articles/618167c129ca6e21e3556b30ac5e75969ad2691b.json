The growing burden of non-communicable chronic diseases, threats of new emerging infections, demographic shifts and global environmental concerns underline the importance of population approaches that take account of a broad view of health. The emergence of human swine flu in Mexico and the USA, and the subsequent worldwide pandemic reinforce the importance of the lessons of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) for strong public health systems. The need for capacity in the public health workforce is not only for disease control and health protection, but also to ensure that health systems deliver effective health care. Conversely, discussion of the role of primary health care in ensuring better public health is gaining greater prominence. The challenges of modern epidemics cannot only be addressed through doctorpatient interactions, and consideration of socio-economic factors is increasingly recognized as key to effective practice.",

            "text": "For many in public health, the 1978 Alma-Ata declaration and its iterations which stress the development of primary care and social and economic measures to promote health for all have set the context of their practice. 1 For some, the balance since Alma-Ata has tilted towards personal health care at the expense of population health. 2 However, current concerns about the affordability and inequity of health care, the ever-expanding menu of newer drugs and procedures, and ageing of the population are near universal. This is reflected in increasing demand, rising costs, and a return towards curative and hospital care, making re-exploration of the Alma-Ata principles both timely and relevant. 3 A better alignment of a population-based public health approach with personal health services is needed urgently, along with better integration of personal health care and public health. To quote van Weel et al., primary care needs to be organized on the principle of care for individuals in the context of the population, and the future of primary care, and health care in general, will depend on how effectively a community-oriented approach and its contribution to equity and social cohesion is achieved. 2 The recognition that health systems play a key role in public health has been endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the report 'Primary Health Care -Now More Than Ever', published on the 30 th anniversary of the international conference of Alma-Ata. Arguing the need to revisit Alma-Ata, the report identifies four broad policy directions of improving health for all: tackling health inequalities through universal coverage; putting people at the centre of care; integrating health into broader public policy; and providing inclusive leadership for health. 4 This approach requires public health strategies as well as clinical skills in meeting the needs of populations, particularly the poor and vulnerable, and is congruent with the influential report from the Commission on Social Determinants of Health which stresses the relevance of an ecological approach to health, essential to achieving the millennium development goals. 5 The implicit need for stronger public health was again re-inforced by the 2009 WHO World Health Assembly resolution which calls for primary healthcare services to provide health promotion and disease prevention as well as curative care and palliative care, and for integration and co-ordinated practice to take account of the needs of populations and to promote active participation by all people. 6 The corollary to these global health policy developments is an increasing interest in appropriate educational strategies, and a growing recognition that public health education must change if it is to meet the needs of modern societies, the health threats they face and the challenge of developing equitable health systems.",

Whereas the traditional concern of public health, particularly within Asia, was with controlling communicable disease, the present challenges also include the burden of the epidemic of noncommunicable disease and achieving health for all with the limited resources available. Protecting and promoting health amongst a growing elderly population, as well as maintaining efforts to reduce the burden of disease related to infections such as tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus/ acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, requires a wellprepared workforce. The increasing emphasis on health literacy, social marketing and community empowerment further highlights the need for new skills and training. Such an analysis therefore raises the key question: How should we educate for better public health practice and who should we educate?",

The impact of the 2008 earthquake in Sichuan, China on people's health, and the importance of the public health response in both the immediate and long-term aftermath are vivid examples.

Public health uses collective or population methods and concerns about the health of the entire population, whereas clinical interventions are targeted at individuals and for the health of the individual. As the population consists of individuals, the two approaches are inevitably inter-related. Collective interventions such as policies will eventually affect individuals and often also need individual participation, whereas interventions for individuals add up to the totality of the society's effort although they could also directly affect the population, such as in the control of infectious diseases. Historically, public health concepts and practice originate from the prevention of communicable diseases, either at an individual level or population level, and have been included in public health practice. Prevention is thus usually considered a part of public health. However, prevention of chronic diseases such as treating hypertension for prevention of stroke and coronary heart disease is normally viewed as clinical medicine. In addition, in many countries, traditional public health methods targeted at individuals, such as vaccination and child and maternal care, have been successfully relocated into the clinical sector, most often primary care or general practice. Such individual public health approaches to prevention are too important to be neglected.",

It must also be concerned with the poor and vulnerable, place emphasis on health as a public good, and recognize the importance of systems and structures (Table 1) . 10 To achieve its missions, public health requires a multidisciplinary approach which includes working with clinicians, particularly those in primary care, as well as with other disciplines and sectors.",

Educating the public health workforce must, de facto, be part of the reforms to achieve the goal of strengthening the establishment of the public health service system by building up sound public health networks of disease prevention, health education, maternal and child health care, mental health, first aid, blood collection and supply, health supervision, and family planning. In addition, the public health functions of the medical services system based on a basic medical services network need to be improved. Such systems need to be supported by an information-sharing and resources-sharing public health services system, enhanced by sufficient capacity in the public health service to respond to public health emergencies and to decrease the urban-rural inequity in utilization of public health services.",

            "text": "The public health system and its education system in mainland China remains largely based on the Soviet model adopted since the 1950s. Today, the core business of public health falls into disease prevention and control, public health emergency response, epidemic reporting and management of health-related information, surveillance of and intervention against health hazards, laboratory testing and evaluation, health education and health promotion, technical management, and applied research guidance. Undergraduate education in public health, which takes place in medical schools, covers areas including epidemiology, biostatistics, environmental health, occupational health and safety, food hygiene, school health, health toxicology and radiation protection. In recent years, medical sociology, maternal and child health, health management and policies, health economics, health inspections and their roles within healthcare services have been gradually added to the curriculum of most schools. There has also been an increase in masters courses in public health. Currently, most graduates in public health work in centres for disease prevention and control at various levels, and some work in health inspection institutions which have functions of inspecting and managing goods and services related to health. From discussions at the workshop, 10 significant problems facing public health education in China were identified: Goals for public health education and training at the national level have not been clearly defined; Public health education is not seen as independent of the traditional medical education system, and the unique characteristics of public health education are not recognized and respected; In schools of public health, there is a lack of expertise in health economics, health management, health policy, and health-related law and regulations; It is difficult to attract high-quality students to public health as compared with clinical medicine; The importance of public health education as part of the public health system has not been well recognized by the Government; Curriculum development has not kept up with the modern developments in public health; Teaching has not kept up with the new technology and teaching contents; Structure of teaching faculty has not kept up with the requirements of education reform; Teaching materials have not kept up with the rapid growth of scientific evidence and with the change in health needs; and Links across universities (e.g. with social science faculties) are poor.",

Too often, the education provided does not take account of the needs in the field. One solution which could be developed is enhanced co-operation between schools of public health and health providers, such as centres for disease control and protection. They could collaborate to develop new ways of working, such as public health case teaching and field training. Health professionals from centres for disease control and protection could also play a more important role in teaching courses, particularly the practical aspects. There are great opportunities for joint research to address current important health problems of the community. What is needed is a mechanism to co-ordinate trainers from universities and healthcare institutions to enable achievement of educational and training aims. Field practice of students also needs to be improved; for example, by adjusting the length of practical experience, engaging school teachers and health professionals to help supervise practice, and selecting appropriate topics for practical experience for future careers.",

They also need to understand their roles in relation to the delivery of community-based services. The present analyses of the challenges facing public health education in China are supplemented by previous studies, most of which are written in Chinese. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Broadened public health workforce and responses in education If these are China's public health needs, who should be considered for training within the public health workforce? This question is one faced by many countries. The issue of who to include within educational strategies for public health is complicated. In general, the public health workforce in mainland China is considered to be primarily those working in centres for disease control and protection, many of whom are trained within the existing system and are medical doctors. However, the challenges of the healthcare reforms require a broader definition of public health which is in line with the ecological model for determinants of health, as well as being responsive to the increasing focus on patient-centred care. Whilst there have been some examples of education for this new public health in other countries which go some way to provide educational frameworks, no system has managed to address all aspects of the new agenda. In addition, all public health structures need to be constructed locally even if common goals are shared.",

Hong Kong has a less structured but similar approach to specialist training (i.e. 5-year postgraduate training) which is competency based. However, in Hong Kong, public health specialists are medically trained, having qualified as physicians through a training programme common to all doctors. In the UK, where public health is also a postgraduate specialty, there are parallel pathways for clinicians and non-clinical (multidisciplinary) specialists. In the USA, where there is more reliance on schools of public health, and Masters of Public Health degrees and public health qualifications are multidisciplinary, new systems of assessing professional competence are being introduced. 21 The role of undergraduate non-medical public health In many countries, the multidisciplinary nature of public health is well recognized; in others, such as the UK, there is a marked shift away from the medical model with explicit recognition of the multidisciplinary basis of specialist public health training and practice. Such recognition highlights the need to continue to develop public health education within medical schools and clinical training, offering opportunities for all undergraduates to acquire basic knowledge of the key concepts in public health, while at the same time ensuring educational and career opportunities for the many different professions with a public health contribution to make, such as teachers, journalists, researchers, administrators, politicians, entrepreneurs, environmentalists, demographers, sociologists, laboratory scientists and legal specialists.

This trend to a broader liberal education is being followed in Hong Kong, where the university curriculum is being extended to 4 years along the lines of the US and mainland Chinese model. Not only has a new BSc now been introduced at university level, 23 but public health has been added into the curriculum for high school students as part of liberal studies for all students, and a further module on health and social care management is also being taught in years 4-6 in middle school. 24 In the USA, there is a growing demand for public health undergraduate courses, and the Association of Schools of Public Health is in the process of devising undergraduate public health competencies. The Asia-Pacific Academic Consortium of Public Health is working to improve public health through the delivery of education, research and public health programmes by member institutions, and actively supports increasing undergraduate public health opportunities, stressing that public health education is more urgent for its region than the rest of the world and that a better system needs to be built, based on developments and experiments already occurring in other universities and other countries and regions. 25 ",
