However, some recent studies [7, 30] show that it is more realistic to use gamma distribution assumption for the waiting time in the disease stages (rather than exponential distribution assumption). Furthermore, Feng et al. [7] showed that quarantine and isolation models that assume exponential distribution (for the disease stages) may not be suitable for diseases with relatively long latent and/or infectious periods for the case when isolation is not completely effective (i.e., isolated individuals can transmit infection).",

The objective of this study is to carry out a rigorous mathematical analysis of a communicable disease transmission model with quarantine (of latent cases) and isolation (of symptomatic cases), in which the waiting periods in the infected classes are assumed to have gamma distributions. Rigorous analysis of the model reveals that it has a globally-asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium whenever its associated reproduction number is less than unity. The model has a unique endemic equilibrium when the threshold quantity exceeds unity. The endemic equilibrium is shown to be locally and globally-asymptotically stable for special cases. Numerical simulations, using data related to the 2003 SARS outbreaks, show that the cumulative number of disease-related mortality increases with increasing number of disease stages. Furthermore, the cumulative number of new cases is higher if the asymptomatic period is distributed such that most of the period is spent in the early stages of the asymptomatic compartments in comparison to the cases where the average time period is equally distributed among the associated stages or if most of the time period is spent in the later (final) stages of the asymptomatic compartments. Finally, it is shown that distributing the average sojourn time in the infectious (asymptomatic) classes equally or unequally does not effect the cumulative number of new cases.",

The models, typically of the forms of deterministic or stochastic systems of non-linear differential equations, are used to evaluate various control strategies such as: vaccination, the use of antibiotics or antivirals, quarantine, isolation, etc. Of the aforementioned control strategies, the use of quarantine (of individuals suspected of being exposed to the disease) and isolation (of those with clinical symptoms of the disease) are the most commonly used (since the beginning of recorded human history). These measures have been used in the control of numerous diseases such as leprosy, plague, cholera, typhus, yellow fever, smallpox, diphtheria, tuberculosis, measles, ebola, pandemic influenza and, more recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [3, 11, [18] [19] [20] 22, 29, 31, 32] . Furthermore, quarantine and isolation are popularly applied to combat the spread of animal diseases such as bovine tuberculosis, rinderpest, foot-and-mouth, psittacosis, 0096-3003/$ -see front matter \u00d3 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Simulations for the cumulative number of probable SARS cases observed during the 2003 outbreaks in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) of Canada are also carried out. The results obtained, for the case m = n = 3, are compared with those obtained using the exponentially-distributed (ED) equivalent of the model (6) (i.e., model (6) with m = n = 1) and another gamma-distributed version of the model (6) with m = n = 3, denoted by GD2, where the average sojourn time in each of the exposed, quarantined, hospitalized and infectious stages is shared equally among each associated disease stage (this is similar to the model given in [7] ). It should be mentioned that, in such a setting, the standard ED model has the associated reproduction number given by R c \u00bc 0:6506. Similarly, the GD2 and GD1 models have R c \u00bc 0:6962 and R c \u00bc 0:9858, respectively. Furthermore, about 250 probable SARS cases were reported for the GTA (see Fig. 2 in [8] ). The simulation results obtained, depicted in Fig. 7 , show that while the ED and GD2 models underestimated the observed number of probable cases, the GD1 model (6) gave a very good estimate of the observed data. It should be mentioned that the GD2 model is also competitive if the quarantine and isolation rates are distributed (unequally) to incorporate their progressive refinement (as in the case of the model GD1).",

In both cases, the same numerical simulation results were obtained (Fig. 9) . In other words, distributing the average sojourn times equally or unequally between the sub stages of the symptomatic classes (I and H) does not alter the numerical simulation results obtained. The effect of the distribution of sojourn times in the asymptomatic classes (E and Q; given by 1/a) is also monitored by simulating the model with the parameters in Table 2 for three different scenarios.

An important feature of this model is that it allows for equal or unequal distribution of the sojourn time in each of the associated infected compartment. Furthermore, it allows for the gradual refinement of quarantine and isolation measures (this was the case during the 2003 SARS outbreaks).
