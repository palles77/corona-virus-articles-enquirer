The selective treatment measure for mitigating and controlling the emerging infectious diseases should be implemented due to limited medical resources. However, how to determine the threshold infected cases and when to implement the selective treatment tactics are crucial for disease control. To address this, we derive a non-smooth Filippov system induced by selective treatment measure. The dynamic behaviors of two subsystems have been discussed completely, and the existence conditions for sliding segment, sliding mode dynamics and different types of equilibria such as regular equilibrium, pseudo-equilibrium, boundary equilibrium and tangent point have been provided. Further, numerical sliding bifurcation analyses show that the proposed Filippov system has rich sliding bifurcations. Especially, the most interesting results are those for the fixed parameter set as the bifurcation parameter varies, the sliding bifurcations occur sequentially: crossing \u2192 buckling \u2192 real/virtual equilibrium \u2192 buckling \u2192 crossing. The key factors which affect the selective treatment measures and the threshold value of infected cases for emerging infectious disease have been discussed in more detail.",

The A/H1N1 (Hemagglutinin 1, Neuraminidase 1) influenza virus, which caused the 2009 pandemic, continues to circulate in some parts of the world, causing variable levels of disease and outbreaks [3] . By September 14, 2014, a total of 4507 probable and confirmed cases, including 2296 deaths from Ebola virus disease (EVD) had been reported from five countries in West Africa-Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sierra Leone [4] . In the early stages of the emerging infectious disease, it is deficient to recognize the emergence of these infectious systematically and comprehensively, the measures of disinfection and isolation are failed to protect and control infected people, so the patients have little resistance to infection of any kind and emerging infectious spread through the camps like wildfire.",

The medical resource limitation seriously restricts the prevention and treatment for SARS. At this moment, the department of health or state has to cite the urgency of fighting SARS, adopts green passage policy that speeds for isolation and treatment for SARS, so the doctors have to focus their attentions on the SARS infected cases only. For the patients with common flu, the doctors can only prescribe medicines and advise them to go home for home treatment, which can significantly relieve the pressure of limited medical resources on hospital or doctors.",

Meanwhile, Fig. 4 (D)also shows that pseudo-equilibrium of Filippov system cannot coexist with the real equilibria. Buckling bifurcation: This type of bifurcation is defined as a standard piece of the cycle starts to pass the invisible quadratic tangent point as the bifurcation parameter varies [31] , as shown in Fig. 5 (C). Fig. 5 (B) clearly shows that Filippov system (2.10) has a stable sliding periodic solution, an invisible quadratic tangent point E 1 T , an unstable regular equilibria E 1 V and E 2 R . As c 2 increases and exceeds 0.7 the piece of the cycle starts to pass the invisible quadratic tangent point E 1 T , and consequently the cycle passes through the whole piece of the sliding segment s , and the sliding cycle does exist in region G 2 and sliding segment s , see Crossing bifurcation: Along with the variation of bifurcation parameter, a stable sliding periodic solution becomes a stable crossing periodic solution, this type bifurcation is called crossing bifurcation. It is interesting to note that a sliding cycle with a single sliding segment ending at E 1 T does exists in both regions G 1 , G 2 and sliding segment s , see Fig. 5 (H). As c 2 increases and reaches 3.45 the sliding cycle only passes the tangent point E 1 T on the sliding segment s .

Noting that the sliding segment s is located within the crossing cycle which exists in both regions G 1 and G 2 . It follows from Fig. 5 (H)-(J) that a crossing bifurcation occurs at c 2 = 3 . 45 .

By comparing the red line with the blue one in Fig. 7 , the limited medical resource has been a great influence on the time when the peak of patients appears and how long does the spread of SARS last. In fact, the blue line (with sufficient medical resources, i.e., b 1 = 0 ) shows that there is a peak of patients in rapid and a sharp decline, the spread of SARS lasts only for a short time. The red line (with limited resources, i.e., b 1 = 2 . 5 ) shows there is a delay in appearance of the peak of patients, and the peak value increases obviously, which indicates that the limited medical resources does not facilitate the treatment of infectious disease.

By using theoretical techniques [26, 27, 31] , the existence conditions for sliding segment, sliding mode dynamics and different types of equilibria such as regular equilibrium, pseudo-equilibrium, boundary equilibrium and tangent point have been provided. Further, numerical sliding bifurcation analyses show that the proposed Filippov system has more rich local and global sliding bifurcations than the case studied in Ref. [10] , as shown in Figs. 1 -5 for more details. Especially, the most interesting results are those for the fixed parameter set as the bifurcation parameter varies, the sliding bifurcations occur sequentially: crossing \u2192 buckling \u2192 real/virtual equilibrium \u2192 buckling \u2192 crossing.",
