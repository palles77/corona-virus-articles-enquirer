Near birth, the phagocytic and bactericidal capacity of neutrophils declines as a result of increased fetal cortisol levels. 62 Bactericidal activity in the serum of the bovine fetus is present by 75 days of gestation, and measurable hemolytic complement activity has been reported at approximately 90 days of gestation. 45 Throughout gestation, however, bovine fetal complement levels are approximately half that found in adult cattle. Nonimmune defense mechanisms increase in their effectiveness throughout gestation, and although they are functional by birth, they can be suppressed by stress, malnutrition, low level infections, or exposure to toxins.",

First, death of the fetus can occur if the immature or inadequate defense mechanisms allow infecting organisms to replicate freely and destroy tissues. Fatal infections usually occur during early gestation, when the fetal immune system cannot mount any protective response. Second, fetal infection can result in persistently infected animals that remain infected into neonatal or adult life. Specific viruses can induce immunologic tolerance or hyporesponsiveness, resulting in little or no antibody production. Examples of such infections include border disease of sheep and bovine virus diarrhea infection of cattle. A third type of reaction can occur when fetal lymphocytes have differentiated to the point at which they can recognize protective antigens of the invading organism. In the event the fetus can recognize and react to such antigens, it may be successful in ridding itself of infection. The outcome of this form of fetal infection is dependent on similar factors that determine the fate of infections in adult animals.",

Although they are capable of mounting an immune response, neonates are best characterized as being immunonaive. This inability to initiate a successful immune response is attributable to the immaturity of protective mechanisms and the time delay in the initiation and production of mechanisms necessary for the generation of humoral and cell-mediated immunity. Indeed, the initial response that is mounted is typically a primary response with a prolonged lag period and low concentrations of immunoglobulins being produced. Therefore, unless adequate maternal immunologic assistance is provided, neonates have an increased likelihood of succumbing to infections that are innocuous to adult animals. The immunologic assistance that neonates receive is through immunoglobulins and other factors present in colostrum. This topic is discussed in greater detail in following sections.",

            "text": "The prepartum transfer of immunoglobulins from maternal circulation into mammary secretions, termed coiostrogenesis, is a discrete and finite stage. In domestic ruminants, transfer begins several weeks before parturition and ceases abruptly immediately before parturition. During this brief period, up to 500 grams/week of IgG are transferred into mammary secretions. 12 Because IgGl comprises more than 85% of the total immunoglobulin in colostrum, it is this high concentration of IgGl that is considered the hallmark of colostrum formationP The source of colostral immunoglobulins is the maternal circulation. 14 The observation that IgGl concentrations in colostrum are typically five to ten times higher than those of immunoglobulin G2 led to the hypothesis of a mechanism that provides specificity for the transfer of IgGl. This hypothesis has since been supported in several studies. 12 , 19, 31 Selective transport of IgGl into colostrum requires two separate functions. 32 First, specific receptors for IgGl must be present on the basal plasma membrane of the mammary secretory cells, positioned for capture of IgGl in extracellular fluid. In addition, mammary secretory epithelial cells must be able to internalize and transcytose IgGl to deliver it into the luminal secretions. Early studies demonstrated that IgGl transfer into secretions involves an active, specific receptor-mediated process. 14 Studies in cattle demonstrated that IgGl binds an Fe-specific receptor located on the basilateral surface of alveolar epithelial cells during colostrum formation but not during established lactation. 22 ,30 These findings were confirmed through immunochemical studies that revealed depletion of staining for IgGl, but not immunoglobulin G2, in the interstitium of colostrum-forming mammary glands. 34 As originally hypothesized, the evidence supports a model wherein the IgGl-receptor complex is endocytosed, transported across the cell in vesicles, and released at the apical surface into colostrum. 8 , 14,33 Like most aspects of mammary function, it appears that colostrogenesis is under the influence of lactogenic hormones and local mechanisms within the mammary gland. Evidence suggests that the initiation of IgGl receptor activity is temporally related to stage I lactogenesis (the enzymatic and cytologic differentiation of cells associated with limited milk secretion), and is therefore under the influence of the lactogenic hormones estrogen and progesterone. 59, 69 Because colostrogenesis ceases before or at the onset of lactation, the hormones necessary for stage IT lactogenesis (copious milk production) are likely candidates for regulating cessation of IgGl transfer. Indeed, studies suggest that cessation of IgGl receptor activity is under the influence of the primary lactogenic hormone, prolactin. 6 ,7 Studies have shown that the control of colostrogenesis is influenced by local regulatory mechanisms that likely act in concert with the systemic hormonal mechanisms. An example of local regulation is illustrated by the variation in immunoglobulin concentration and content that occurs between individual quarters of the same udder. 21, 23, 40 Because one can assume that all quarters are subject to common systemic regulation, the differences must arise at the level of the glands themselves.",

At 48 hours before and 48 hours after parturition, T lymphocytes make up 33% and 16% of mammary mononuclear cells, respectively. Within T-cell populations, an average T4/T8 ratio of 0.83 exists during this period. 48 It is now widely accepted that T cells in mammary secretions are selected cells, with phenotypes different from those found in peripheral blood. 37 Bovine mammary secretion T lymphocytes express predominantly the a/13 T-cell receptor heterodimer (a/I3TCR), whereas the -y/3TCR makes up most T cells in peripheral blood?O Mammary secretion T lymphocytes have a two-times higher level of C02 expression and five-times lower level of CD45 + expression compared with peripheral blood. 48 Depending on the phenotypic characteristics of colostral T lymphocytes, it is likely that these cells transfer immune functions to the neonate and also secrete cytokines. 37 The established immunomodulating effects of mammary secretions would suggest that CD4 and CD8 cells playa role in mediation. In vitro results suggest a role of CD4 T cells through production of various cytokines. The enhanced proportions of CD8 T cells are likely to be involved in immunosuppressive properties of colostrum and milk, allowing for a more controlled activation of the neonatal immune system. 37 B lymphocytes make up approximately 24% of cells in bovine colos-trum.48 It is believed that their primary role is to synthesize dimeric immunoglobulin A, which is then excreted in the mammary secretion. Polymorphonuclear cells isolated from mammary secretions have decreased functional capacities involving migration and phagocytosis. Because of this, it is believed that their primary role is likely devoted to defense of the mammary gland and, less so, to protection of the neonate. Interestingly, it has been hypothesized that polymorphonuclear cells, after engulfing immunoglobulin present in secretions, might protect immunoglobulins from enzymatic digestion during passage through the gastrointestinal tract of the neonate. 51 Limited studies of macrophages in mammary secretions of cattle suggest that their principal role in the neonate may be to act as cytokine-producing and antigen-presenting cells. 50",

These techniques, in conjunction with specific guidelines, are used to define whether a neonate has attained adequate passive transfer, or alternatively, suffers failure of passive transfer. A serum IgGl concentration of 10 mg/mL at 48 hours of age can be used as the objective value for defining the threshold between adequate passive transfer and failure of passive transfer. 20 Tests for immunoglobulin concentration vary in their speed, accuracy, and equipment required for operation. All require separation of serum as the first step. The single radial immunodiffusion and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests are the only ones that directly measure serum IgG concentration. All other tests, including zinc sulfate turbidity, sodium sulfite precipitation, whole blood glutaraldehyde coagulation, total serum solids by refractometry, and gamma-glutamyl transferase activity estimate serum IgG concentration based on total proteins for which passive transfer is statistically associated with that of IgG. Recently, several articles have been published that have fine-tuned these various testing methods to provide more accurate values for defining immunoglobulin levels in the neonate. 25, 47, 65, 66 Although the identification of optimum threshold values for these tests is useful, they must be kept in perspective and their use not overinterpreted, Various studies that have examined the relationship between serum immunoglobulin levels in calves and disease incidence and subsequent production have had conflicting results. Several studies have demonstrated significant increases in morbidity and mortality in calves suffering failure of passive transfer and have been reviewed. 20 Other studies, however, have failed to demonstrate a strong association between immunoglobulin levels and morbidity. In one study of 381 dairy calves, no statistically significant relationship was observed between plasma immunoglobulin concentrations and disease incidence or weight gain. 15 In other studies involving intensive calf-rearing operations, many healthy calves with normal performance parameters had low serum immunoglobulin concentrations. 5 , 39 In another study comparing groups of calves fed high-and low-immunoglobulin concentration colostrum and calves not fed colostrum, no difference in mortality rates was observed between calves fed high-or low-immunoglobulin concentration colostrum; however, colostrum-deprived calves suffered significant mortality. 42 Notwithstanding the disparate results of these calf studies, some general conclusions can still be drawn. An association exists between higher IgG (or protein) levels and lower disease incidence. This association, however, appears to be more influential in herds with high disease incidence than in herds with low disease incidence. Finally, the rate of disease occurrence is a balance between a calf's ability to resist disease and the severity of disease that is challenging the calf. Although immunoglobulin concentration is one factor that contributes to disease resistance, it gives no information regarding the degree of disease challenge.",

This may result in tolerance of maternal immunoglobulins such that the duration of passive immunity is prolonged. Colostrum-fed calves have lower peripheral blood lymphocyte blastogenic responses to T-and B-cell mitogens compared with colostrum-deprived calves. 16 The immunomodulatory properties of colostrum have also been shown in vitro.

Attaining sufficiently low levels of maternally derived immunoglobulins is primarily dependent on the mass of immunoglobulin absorbed during the colostral meal and less so on the half-life of the specific immunoglobulin isotype.

Although immunocompetent, the neonate is immunonaive and dependent on passively acquired maternal immunoglobulins, immune cells, and other substances from colostrum for protection. Neonates that suffer failure of passive transfer of maternal immunoglobulins may be at increased risk for disease; however, many other factors interact in conjunction with the level of passively acquired immunoglobulin to determine the occurrence of disease. These include, but are not limited to, management, environment, hygiene, infection pressure, virulence of organisms, and antibody specificity.",

            "text": "In addition to immunoglobulins, colostrum contains large numbers of immune cells and cytokines. It is thought that the primary role for the cellular component of colostrum is to interact with the development of local immunity and to modulate active immunization of the neonatal intestine. In particular, T lymphocytes are thought to transfer immune functions and secrete cytokines. Although most of the major cytokines have been identified in colostrum and milk, their biologic effects on the neonate have yet to be determined.",
