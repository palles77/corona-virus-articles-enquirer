In order to establish optimization of different parameters of chemical transformation, that is the reaction pathway for each step and reaction conditions in the each step, in the present paper, different solvents and catalysts were used. The structures of the synthesized compounds were assigned on the basis of elemental analysis, IR, 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR spectral data. All the newly synthesized compounds were screened against various strains of bacteria and fungi. \u00aa 2011 King Saud University. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.",

            "text": "The number of life-threatening infectious diseases caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria has reached an alarming level in many countries around the world. Recently, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) caused by the novel corona virus SARS-CoV (Chang et al., 2007; Yeung and Meanwell, 2007) and bird flu caused by avian influenza (H5N1) virus (Gary and Ting, 2007) have emerged as two important infectious diseases with pandemic potential. Both infections crossed the species barrier to infect humans. Also, the ever growing demand for material protection from microbial contamination is a serious challenge (Berber et al., 2003) . The aforementioned facts are a cause of great concern and create a pressing need for new anti-bacterial agents. Despite great effort from the pharmaceutical industry to manage the resistance problem, the discovery and development of new mechanistic classes of antibiotics has found very little success (Taun et al., 2007) . The difficulty of this task is demonstrated by the fact that only two antibiotics of new classes, linezolid (an oxazolidinone) and daptomycin (a cyclic lipopeptide), have been successfully developed in the past three decades (Carpenter and Champers, 2004; Weigelt et al., 2005) .",

They are widely used in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals (Tobe et al., 2003) ; for example, fluquinconazole fungicide for the control of agriculture diseases (Guang-Fang et al., 2007) . Several reports have been published on the biological activity of quinazoline derivatives, including their bactericidal, herbal and anti-tumour activity (Raffa et al., 1999; Chenard et al., 2001) . Thus, their synthesis has been of great interest in the elaboration of biologically active heterocyclic compounds. Recently, it was reported that some iodoquinazolines exhibited moderate antibacterial activity (Alafeefy, 2008) . Prompted by these findings, this article reports the design and synthesis of an extension series of 3-substituted 2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-one derivatives and tested their antibacterial activities.",

Quinolones with substituents at C-6 position, albeit less activity than fluorine, are essential for high activity as evidenced by its enhanced gyrase inhibition and cell penetration (Bhanot et al., 2001) . A number of substituents for fluorine replacement have been introduced into that position. Garenoxacin showed greater potency than the newer fluoroquinolone and moxifloxacin against both sensitive and resistant gram positive organisms, thus casting doubt on the validity of necessity of C-6 fluorine (Emami et al., 2006) . Several efforts to further modify nonfluoroquinolone and their biological activities were also investigated (Ctoen-Chackal et al., 2004; Chevalier et al., 2001) .",

Furthermore, drug research and development have led to the discovery of new pharmacologically active agents, including imidoxy (Wolfgang, 1998) compounds such as succinimidoxy (Farror et al., 1993) . They also possess a strong anti-convulsant activity (Edafiogho et al., 1991) . 4-Thiazolidinones may be considered as phosphate bioisosteres and therefore inhibit the bacterial enzyme MurB which is involved in the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall (Gursoy et al., 2005) . In addition, some thiazolidinones were recently reported as novel inhibitors of mycobacterial rhamnose synthetic enzymes (Gursoy et al., 2005) . This new approach is believed to be selective as rhamnose is not found in humans, but is essential for mycobacterial cell wall synthesis in animals (Andres et al., 2000) .",

The mixture was refluxed for 10-12 h, after the completion of the reaction, it was cooled and the excess solvent distilled and poured into sodium bicarbonate solution to neutralize it. The solid product was filtered, washed with cold water. The resulting light brown colour product was obtained. The completion of the reaction was checked by TLC [n-hexane/ethyl acetate (V/ V = 1:3)].

Reaction conditions were non-homogeneous and the use of an excess amount of hydrazine hydrate did not afford desired results. The reaction conditions for the synthesis of (II) were optimized in various solvents at different temperatures and different time. The results were observed and data was reported in Table 1 . In step-(II), ethanol was used as a solvent and refluxed at 78\u00b0C, reaction was completed in 4 h and yield was found to be 24% (Table 2 , step-(II), entry-1). When we used isopropanol as a solvent and at 85\u00b0C temperature for 4 h, we found that 31% yield was obtained (Table 2, step-(II), entry-2). Pyridine was used as a solvent and reaction mixture was refluxed at 116\u00b0C for 3 h, we found that 87% yield was obtained (Table 2 , step-II, entry-3). Thus for the synthesis of intermediate compound- (2), pyridine is considered to be appropriate solvent and higher temperature (more than 100\u00b0C) was the perfect parameter for step-2.",

In addition, we also examined the effect of time taken for the completion of reaction. When the reaction time was decreased to 20 h, suddenly yield was improved (75%) ( Table 2 , step-(III), entry-3), We have also noted that the time decreased to 10 h, the yield was found to be (72%). Also, it could be observed that the yield was significantly lower at room temperature (Table 2, step-(III), entry-4).

The absorption peak at 3002 cm \u00c01 is due to the stretching vibration of methylene group. The strong absorption at 1671 cm \u00c01 is due to the >C\u201aO stretching vibration, which is present in quinazolinone on position C-2, while another absorption peak at 1663 cm \u00c01 is due to the >C\u201aO stretching vibration in thiazolidine ring and the moderate intensity absorption at 1623 cm \u00c01 corresponds to a >C\u201aN-stretching vibration. The 1605-1580 cm \u00c01 absorptions are due to the skeleton vibration of the aryl and heterocyclic rings. The broad absorption peak at 3432 cm \u00c01 is observed due to the -OH stretching vibration. The absorption peak at 756 cm \u00c01 is due to the chlorine atom, which is attached with a carbon atom at C-19. The vibration at 845 cm \u00c01 is due to the bending vibration of methylene group.

A single peak that appeared at d = 5.97 ppm must be for proton attached at C-17 which is present in thiazolidine ring. A single peak appeared at d = 5.35 ppm of -OH group which is attached with C-32. The proton of the methylene group appear as a singlet at d = 7.33 ppm. The protons of the phenyl ring (C-29, C-30, C-31 and C-33) appeared between d = 6.70 and 7.16 ppm, respectively. The proton attached at C-23 position appeared as a multiplet at d = 7.59 ppm due to mutual coupling with protons attached at C-22 and C-24, while proton attached at C-22 position appeared as a multiplet at d = 7.74 ppm due to mutual coupling with C-21 and C-23. The proton at C-21 appeared as a doublet at d = 7.99 ppm, while proton at C-24 appeared at d = 8.03 ppm and proton at C-26 appeared at d = 8.27 ppm.",
