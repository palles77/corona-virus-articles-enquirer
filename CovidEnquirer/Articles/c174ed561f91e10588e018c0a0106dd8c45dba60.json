            "text": "A cute respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are the most common illnesses in humans and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In children, viruses are responsible for the majority of RTIs, with bacteria and other pathogens thought to be responsible for fewer than 15% of cases. 1 However, even with the best methods for viral detection currently available, a specific pathogen cannot be identified in 20% to 50% of RTIs. [1] [2] [3] [4] Existing viral diagnostic methods are limited in sensitivity and scope. Virus isolation by culture takes days to weeks, and many viruses remain fastidious or unculturable. Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing has a turnaround time of 2 hours, but may suffer from low sensitivity and is available for only a limited number of viruses. 5 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is rapid and highly sensitive, and has supplanted culture as the new gold standard for detecting respiratory viruses in research settings. 3, 4 However, most PCR tests target only 1 virus at a time, making these assays cumbersome in routine clinical practice. For simultaneous detection of up to 20 viruses, a number of multiplex PCR assays have been proposed. 3, 4, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Recently, DNA microarray testing has emerged as a promising new technology for broad-spectrum virus detection. [11] [12] [13] We previously designed an in-house microarray platform to detect all known viruses, as well as novel viruses related to known viral families (Virochip; University of California San Francisco [UCSF] ). 13 \u03f322 000 oligonucleotide probes representing all \u03f31800 fully or partially sequenced viruses in GenBank as of Fall 2004. The performance of the Virochip in respiratory virus detection has been tested previously using virally infected tissue culture cells 13 and in selected patient cohorts. 15 To date, the Virochip has not been compared directly with standard diagnostic tests for viruses in a clinical setting; thus, in the present study, we sought to compare the Virochip with conventional clinical DFA-and PCR-based testing in the detection of respiratory viruses associated with RTIs in children.",

The most common viral pathogens identified were RSV (19%), picornaviruses (16%), and FluA/B (11%). Notably, most viruses detected in the respiratory tracts of the patients with nonrespiratory illnesses and in the immunocompromised patients were picornaviruses. These findings are consistent with the observation that asymptomatic RV infections can be seen in 4% to 12% of healthy individuals and suggest that immunocompromised hosts may be more susceptible to colonization or overt respiratory illness by picornaviruses. 23 Our frequency of detection of 16% for picornaviruses is consistent with that of a previously published report (18% RVs, 2.9% EVs) that also used consecutive NPA samples. 24 Our comparison of the Virochip with DFA demonstrates that the former has superior sensitivity for respiratory virus detection. Importantly, about 50% of the overall increase in detection rate corresponds to samples with inconclusive DFA results due to low cellular content. Unlike DFA, nucleic acid detection methods, such as microarray and PCR, are capable of detecting free viral particles in addition to virusinfected cells.

Although comparable with findings from other detection methods, [1] [2] [3] [4] 8, 9 this result is likely an underestimation of the true number of positives arising from several factors. First, some samples may have been missed by the Virochip due to low virus titers at the detection limits of PCR. Second, the use of RNA (rather than DNA) as the source material in this study may have given rise to lower-than-expected rates of detection of DNA viruses such as AdVs, herpesviruses, and parvoviruses. The Virochip may not have detected any cases of human bocavirus, a recently described parvovirus, 31 because this virus shares low sequence identity to parvovirus sequences currently represented on the Virochip. Finally, 32% of patients with RTIs in this study were diagnosed with pneumonia, 35% of which were hospital-associated. Many of these cases of pneumonia may be nonviral in origin, as suggested by previous epidemiologic studies of pneumonia in hospitalized children. 32, 33 Using custom PCR primers, we confirmed at least 3 of the 6 microarray-positive/PCR-negative cases (1 RSV, 1 RV, and 1 EV) as true positive tests for viruses. Detection of such cases by microarray is not unexpected, because the Virochip uses multiple probes that are derived from different sites in the viral genome and have a higher tolerance for sequence mismatches than the primers used in specific PCR. This results in improved detection of divergent viruses. 14, 34 We suspect that the microarray-positive/PCR-negative cases of virus infection were missed by clinical PCR likely due to mismatches between primer and target sequences, 35 although limited specimen availability affected our ability to show this definitively.",

            "text": "Although the prospect of comprehensive viral detection with a single microarray assay is appealing, several challenges must be addressed before the use of this technology can become practical in clinical diagnosis. First, setting up the technology entails significant initial startup costs, including the cost of the microarray printer and viral oligonucleotides, as well as ongoing material and labor costs. Second, the turnaround time for the assay is currently \u03f324 hours; it may be possible to decrease the processing duration by using ultra-rapid polymerases for amplification or controlled agitation techniques during hybridization. Third, reproducibility and consistent array quality are of concern. In our study, none of the microarray assays had to be repeated, and the inherent probe redundancy built into the method makes the assay robust for the purpose of virus detection. For example, of the 300 oligonucleotide probes on the Virochip designed to hybridize to rhinoviruses, as few as 4 high-intensity oligonucleotides are sufficient to make a successful virus identification. Statistical methods for interpreting the microarray data, as exemplified by E-Predict, can be completely automated, allowing ease of use and freedom from operator bias. Smaller microarrays aimed at detecting targeted virus sets (eg, respiratory viruses only) would reduce costs and simplify issues of reproducibility, quality control, and data analysis.",

One approach would be to use the platform for direct diagnosis of respiratory infections, as reported here. An alternative approach could be to deploy a viral microarray as an instrument of discovery rather than of routine detection, with the goal of identifying divergent or unexpected viruses that elude diagnosis using conventional methods. Once a new candidate pathogen was identified, a specific PCR-based or DFA-based assay could then be developed to detect the virus with a high degree of sensitivity in clinical samples. In this scenario, the microarray assay would complement rather than replace existing diagnostic techniques such as PCR. ",
