For demonstration of circulating FCoV immune complexes, a competitive ELISA was performed (Pfeiffer, 1991) . Test serum was treated with polyethylenglycole for precipitation of immune complexes. The resolubilized precipitate was applied to a microtitre plate coated with FIPV (FIPV-DF2). FCoV-containing immune complexes inhibit binding of a mouse monoclonal antibody against FCoV to the FIPV-coated microtiter plate. Thereby, binding of peroxidase-labelled goat anti-mouse IgG is reduced, resulting in lower extinction levels. The threshold value for a positive result had been statistically evaluated (Schroo, 1994) . Virus was isolated from buffy coat monocytes of SPF cats at TP 3 and 4, and cultivated on whole feline embryo (WFE) cells (Gunn-Moore et al., 1998) .",

            "text": "Results show that long-term naturally FIPV-exposed cats develop CoV infection and start a CoV-specific immune response regardless of the development of FIP: animals exhibit CoV antibody titres and circulating FCoV immune complexes during exposure. The presence of FCoV immune complexes can be regarded as indicative of an FIPV infection as experimental studies have shown that in FECV-infected cats, circulating FCoV immune complexes only occur occasionally during a short time period after about 3 weeks postinfection. Cats which develop FIP, however, remain positive for a longer time span (Pfeiffer, 1991) . Although virus shedding, indicated by demonstration of CoV particles in the ingesta and CoV genome in faeces (Addie et al., 1996; Foley et al., 1997) , was not consistently detected, CoV isolation supports that all exposed animals were viraemic (Gunn-Moore et al., 1998) . FIPV-exposed cats without FIP exhibit an intensely stimulated immune system, represented by distinct follicular and T-cell hyperplasia in spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes, and an hyperplastic thymus. Active mesenteric lymph nodes, however, are also observed in control cats, indicating that already the normal intestinal bacterial flora induces an intense immune activity. Nevertheless, the demonstration of plasma cells positive for CoV-specific antibodies in situ in FIPV-exposed cats support that the observed systemic immune response is CoV-specific (Kipar et al., 1998) .",
