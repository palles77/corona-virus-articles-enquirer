            "text": "CS31 A $brillae are thin, flexible, heteropolymeric proteinaceous appendages exposed as a capsule-like material around the cell surface of certain Escherichia coli strains. Two antigenic peptides of the S spike glycoprotein (TGEV-S) amino acids (aa) 363-371 and 521-531 of the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) were tandemly introduced in the loop-structured, variable region aa 202-218 of the major ClpG subunit protein composing the bulk of CS31A. The resulting hybrid jibrillae with a 25 aa heterologous peptide were produced at the cell surface. Using a monoclonal antibody (Mab) specific for the TGEV epitopes, purtjied hybrid jibrillae were analysed in Western blotting under native conditions, which showed that the two viral epitopes were recognized immunologically as an integral part of the hybridfibrillae, and therefore that they were antigenically active. The immunogenicity of the fusion construct was evaluated with live recombinant bacteria, purtjied hybrid ClpG monomers, and purified chimeric CS31 A polymers. Whatever the form of hybrid used as antigen, intraperitoneally immunized outbred mice elicited serum anti-TGEV peptides antibodies (Abs) with sign$cant titres and capable of recognizing native TGEV particles, indicating that the epitopes are exposed in an immunogenic conformation in all cases. However, virus neutralization titres were only obtained after immunization with either pur$ed polymers or monomers. Furthermore, 4 months after an ultimate immunization with 20 ,ug of hybrid jibrillae mice developed a strong anamnestic Ab response against the two TGEV peptides following booster inoculation with virions. We conclude that CS31A jibrillae carrying a combination of TGEV epitopes as insert can induce an immunological memory in outbred animals infected with TGEV, and therefore that hybrid CS3lA fibrillae may prove eficient as components of a subunit vaccine.

Comparison of the amino acid (aa) sequences of the major subunit proteins from CS31Arelated fibrillae, namely K88 and F41, revealed a variable region in ClpG (aa 19 1-218) forming a flexible loo structure, as assessed by the topological model of ClpG B This region contains a hydrophilic domain and several accessible continuous immunodominant epitopes, one of which (aa 189-194) is exposed on the CS31A polymer (unpublished data). The aa 191-218 region of ClpG has been demonstrated to accept various small heterologous antigenic peptides without affecting fibrillae formatior?. All these features make this region interesting to presenting a foreign antigen as repeating units along the CS31A polymer.",

Coronavirions contain at least four structural proteins: the S spike glycoprotein (TGEV-S); the N nucleoprotein; the M membrane glycoprotein; and the sM protein. TGEV-S has been shown to mediate attachment of virions to the host cell receptor, to be involved in cell-to-cell fusion, to be the major inducer of TGEV neutralizing_Fntibodies (Abs), and to bear virulence determinants . Because transmissible gastroenteritis disease continues to cause major economic losses to the swine industry, and to date effective vaccines or treatments have remained elusive\", there is a demand for the development of a new type of vaccine against TGEV.

The pEH524-determined clp gene cluster contains seven structural genes encoding all the secretory proteins required for CS31A biogenesis ( Figure IA) . They include the major ClpG subunit protein and several accessory proteins involved in the stabilization, transport and assembly of ClpG. The clpG gene codes for the ClpG precursor whose ,grocessing results in a mature polypeptide of 257 aa . To perform DNA manipulations in cZpG without affecting the rest of the operon, clpG and cZp helper-genes were cloned into two separate compatible plasmids ( Figure IB ). The first, pDSPH524l', contains the clp ene cluster with clpG deleted, and the second, !? pPSX83 , clpG only. Plasmid pDSPH524 was constructed by deleting the SphI-5'phI fragment from pEH524 and religating. Plasmid pPSX83 was made by cloning cZpG from pEH524 as a PstI-HpaI fragment dowstream of the Zac promoter in the PstI-SmaI sites of the high-copy number vector l&elect-l (Promega  Corporation) carrying ColEl replicon. In transcomplementation experiments, pDSPH524 and pPSX83 were co-selected on the basis of their chloramphenicol and tetracycline resistance, respectively. The insertion vector pPSXlOS ( Figure 2b ) was constructed in two steps from pPSX83 after two consecutive rounds of oligonucleotide-directed site mutagenesis as previously described5, resulting in the creation of unique SpeI and BgflI sites in clpG ( Figure 2b ).

One of the transformants screened by in situ colony-immunoblotting and reactive towards the TGEV-C site-specific Mab 3b.5, the TGEV-A sitespecific Mab lA.FlO, and the ClpG-specific antiserum, was selected. Electron microscopy analysis of the immunogold-labelled E. coli cells bearing pGCAlO2 confirmed the production of the CS31A hybrid fibrillae at the cell surface ( Figure 3A ). Hybrid fibrillae were extracted by the thermo-elution procedure as described in , and separated by l&l 5% PAGE under denaturing or native conditions for Western blot analysis (Figure 3 ). The denatured form of hybrid CS31A, consisting of the ClpG203-CA monomers, exhibited two protein bands reacting with anti-ClpG antiserum ( Figure 3B ). The upper band represents the expected full-length hybrid protein since immunologically revealed additionally by 3b.5 and lA.FlO and since migrating slightly slower than the wild-type ClpG protein. By contrast, the lower band migrating faster than ClpG was recognized by anti-ClpG and 3b.5, but not by lA.FlO. The ability of hybrid ClpG203-CA subunit to polymerize into a chimerit CS31A fibrillum structure was evidenced from Western blots using PAGE under non-denaturing conditions ( Figure 3C ). Hybrid CS3 1 A fibrillum appeared as a ladder of oligomeric bands of regulary increasing molecular mass constituting the polymeric form of the CS31A chimera. Each oligomer migrated as a double protein band, the major upper band reacting with anti-CS31A, 3b.5 and lA.FlO, and the minor lower band only with anti-CS31A and 3b.5. Altogether, these findings demonstrated the normal antigenic properties of the two viral epitopes exposed on the CS3 1A hybrid fibrillae at the E. coli cell-surface. However, these results also showed that the full fusion construct was partially cleaved, likely by an undefined bacterial protease, and that, unlike TGEV-C, TGEV-A in the truncated form of hybrid was antigenically inactive.",

Groups of five animals belonging to each of the six different strains of mice, were intraperitoneally (ip.) immunized with purified ClpG203-CA monomers. In all cases, immunization resulted in the elicitation of Ab responses against ClpG and TGEV-C, but not against TGEV-A which was restricted essentially to H-2b haplotype. Moreover, only the anti-ClpG and anti-peptide C titres were positively correlated (Figure 4) . Mice with H-2d haplotype clearly appeared to be the lowest Ab producers whatever the antigen tested. While the production of anti-ClpG and anti-peptide C was better in C57BL/6 (H-2b), CBA/J (H-2k), SJL (H-2\") and Swiss mice, only the former and the latter appeared as the best responders to the ClpG-fused A peptide.

It was found that mice developed serum Abs with significant titres and capable of recognizing the ClpG carrier protein, the free synthetic TGEV peptides, and the virus particles, with anti-virus titres that are equivalent whatever the type of hybrid-containing preparation used for immunization. Expression of TGEV-S sites A and C, as a fusion protein on the surface of E, coli led to induction of TGEVneutralizing Abs when purified recombinant antigen was used as immunogen, but not when live vector was administered. Ab responses in mice immunized with bacteria are lower than in mice immunized with purified proteins probably because lower yields of hybrid proteins associated to the bacteria compared to the 20 pg inoculated with purified proteins as previously discussed5.

Six days later, an expected strong memory Ab response was induced against the two TGEV peptides and the carrier protein following booster inoculation with the homologous hybrid fibrillae ( Figure 6A ). More interesting, a memory Ab response against these viral peptides was also induced following booster inoculation with virus 6 days after the last immunization, with anti-peptide A and anti-peptide C titres that increased 35-and 15.fold, respectively ( Figure 6B ). Anamnestic effects were specific to sites A and C since, in the same conditions of immunization and booster, control mice inoculated with a different CS31A hybrid, which carried the rotavirus VP6 epitope instead of TGEV epitopes, produced no anti-peptide A and only a weak response against C peptide following inoculation with TGEV ( Figure 6C ). The anti-peptide C titre elicited by the control mice at day 150 was 120.fold lower than that elicited by mice immunized with CS31A fibrillae carrying TGEV epitopes. Therefore, TGEV-A and TGEV-C under their CS31A fibrillae-associated form of fusion to the major ClpG subunit induced memory Abs, likely through B-cells activation by TGEV epitopes under their natural viral conformation.",

For this purpose, two antigenic peptides of the protein S of TGEV, namely TGEV-C (aa 363-371) and TGEV-A (aa 521-531) were tandemly inserted into the aa 202-218 part of the major fibrillar ClpG subunit. We have shown previously that introduction of different foreign epitopes in this ClpG region resulted in an effective assembly of the hybrid subunits into CS3lA fibrillaej, suggesting that aa 202-218 region would be the most favourable region for insertion. From results reported here, we provide evidence that the CS31A carrier-delivery system offers a realistic epitope-based strategy for recombinant TGEV vaccine development since:",

            "text": "Here, the immunogenicity of the recombinant bacteria, purified hybrid ClpG monomers or chimeric CS31A polymers was studied in i.p. immunized mice. Since, mucosal immunity is essential to provide protection against TGEV infections, we are evaluating also the secretory immunoresponses to various live E. coli producing different CS3 1A fibrillae chimeras with TGEV-A or/and TGEV-C epitopes inserted into different permissive sites of ClpG. Currently, we have some data supporting IgA responses. Thus, although results from bacteria expressing the TGEV-C::TGEV-A fusion peptide at the 202-218 region of ClpG, to which this work was focusing, are not available yet, data from bacteria presenting only TGEV-C epitope at this same region indicate that such recombinant bacteria are capable of eliciting IgA responses in mice. In this case, when five outbred Swiss mice were inoculated orally with 2 x lo9 live bacteria on days 0, 14 and 35, specific IgA Abs against the CS31A fibrillum carrier and TGEV-C peptide were detected 10 days later in intestinal fluids with a mean titre of l/180 (l/128-1/256) and l/16 (<l/16-1/32), respectively. Therefore, we think that CS31A fibrillae chimeras may prove efficient as components in combination with a mucosal adjuvant or as live oral vaccines, especially since chimeric CS3lA fibrillae can induce immunological memory and mucosal immunity in out-bred animals, and since CS3lA can also be expressed in the attenuated Salmonella typhimurium SL3261 strain'.",
