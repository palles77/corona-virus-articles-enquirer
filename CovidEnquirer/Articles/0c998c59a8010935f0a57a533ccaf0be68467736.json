Very little is known about such aerosol dissemination or the means for minimizing exposure to these aerosols. This study has evaluated the efficacy of ultraviolet waveband C (UV-C) for disinfection of flushing-generated pathogen-laden aerosols through tests with localized disinfection systems for airborne and surface contaminations. Three types of bacteria were chosen for investigation: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhimurium. Tests were conducted with UV-C tubes of 5 W and 10 W. High levels of disinfection efficacies were observed, ranging from 76% to 97% for bacteria-laden aerosols at sources of emission, and efficiencies of 53% to 79% for surface samples in localized systems. The results from the localized systems were further compared with those obtained with an upper-room ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) system. As it is important to note, the UV-C doses and ozone emissions for the localized systems were found well below the limits recommended in current guidelines. This research has shown that the disinfection of flushing-generated pathogen-laden aerosols in proximity to the source of emission was more effective than at the more distant sites where aerosols may be dispersed to the environment.",

One experiment involved seeding a residential toilet with S. marcescens to measure airborne concentrations after flushing [9] , and found that the abundance of S. marcescens in the air increased sharply, from zero CFU/m 3 (colony-forming units per cubic meter) to 1370 CFU/m 3 after the first flushing. A similar study was recently conducted in a hospital to determine the concentration of Clostridium difficile following flushing [11] . The present authors investigated the emission strength of three pathogens following toilet flushing under flushometer and cistern tank scenarios [12] . Airborne emission was evidenced, and the emission for the first flush was found to be strongly correlated with bacteria sizes. This was an important finding, which demonstrated bacteria aerosolization, environmental contamination, and potential biological exposure from toilet flushing. With the extremely high load of viable pathogens found in feces, toilet flushing can be a potential source of infection [6, 8] .",

This source of contamination is also a major public health concern, as hand contact with contaminated surfaces can result in self-inoculation through touching the eyes, nose, or mouth [8] . Surface contamination studies have identified significant microbial contamination of washroom surfaces, including doors, toilet seats, sinks, and floors [9, 13, 17] . Apart from ventilation system design, virtually no engineering strategy has been developed and implemented on a wide scale to control the risk of infection from toilets. Various commercial products have been developed, such as toilet seat papers, toilet seat disinfectant gels/ foams, and automatic toilet bowl cleaners or tablets [18] . These products may be effective for controlling the \"existing\" pathogens on the bowl surfaces or toilet seats. However, none of these measures can completely prevent transmission through the aerosolization of fecal matter during toilet flushing. Therefore, in-situ disinfection is needed to reduce the concentrations of airborne pathogens from toilets both in the air and on surfaces.",

To test this approach, a UV lamp was located near the vicinity of the contaminated sources to inactivate the flushinggenerated contaminants. According to the fundamental principle of pollution control, it is always best to control at the source, rather than seeking to control after dispersion. This concept has been widely applied in various industries such as local exhaust ventilation systems. For toilet disinfection using a localized UV-C installation, the mechanism should be characterized by small size, high efficiency, and minimal risk to users from exposure to irradiation. Our experiment is the first pilot study to test the use of this configuration for the inactivation of flushing-generated contaminants. The efficacy of disinfection is measured for both airborne and surface contaminations, and the results are compared with those for UR-UVGI.",

The Z-value is the value that indicates the degree of sensitivity of microorganisms to the bactericidal effects of UV-C. The higher the z-value, the more susceptible is the microorganism to killing by the UV-C irradiation [32] . It is very difficult to obtain published Z-values for all the three bacteria tested in this study. The only obtainable previously published Z values of these bacteria showed that E. coli (Z = 0.10575 m 2 /J and Z = 0.50628 m 2 /J for surface and airborne disinfections, respectively) are more susceptible to UV-C than S.

Additionally, the Z values also revealed that the susceptibility of E. coli to UV-C is also higher in airborne disinfection than surface disinfection.

In fact, very high effectiveness of UR-UVGI has been reported in previous applications, such as TB isolation rooms or homeless shelters [33, 34] . Three inter-related issues; emission characteristic, air mixing, and dose, attributed to the results. The emission characteristics of previous applications are very different from the toilet flushing conditions examined in this study. Most previous work on applying UVGI is for the well-mixed environment [25, 35, 36] . It should also be noted, however, that toilet emission is episodic with \"initial\" and \"strong\" emission stages of a toilet flushing. It has been found that improper air mixing can decrease the efficiency of UR-UVGI by around 80% [37] . Finally the difference in performance can also be attributed to the UV-C doses received by the micro-organisms. If the ACH is 8 h \u22121 , the residence time of micro-organisms is 450 s, but for an episodic event such as flushing a toilet, the UV-C dose received by the micro-organisms is substantially shorter than 450 s. As the ventilation exhaust grill is located right above the toilet bowl, it is anticipated that the residence time would be approximately 10 s. The current and existing studies are indicators that synergistic effect of UR-UVGI, localized UV lamps and ventilation would produce higher disinfection efficiency than individual disinfection mechanism.",

For an individual who visits toilets eight times in an 8-hour period and is exposed to the localized UV-C installation, the UV doses received when the eye level is at heights 140 cm and 70 cm from ground level would be 0.24 mJ/cm 2 and 0.32 mJ/cm 2 , respectively. The average dose would only be 4.6% of the guideline-recommended dose limit (6 mJ/cm 2 ). Thus, the doses from the localized UV-C source did not appear to pose any health threat to the users' eyes or skin under normal circumstances. However, for persons such as janitors, who may need to repeatedly bend down to clean toilet bowls, the UV-C dose exposure is expected to be higher. To avoid over-exposure, the UV-C sources can be turned off during the cleaning period. Similarly, the ozone emissions from both localized UV-C sources were three to eight times less than the acceptable limit. The concerns over adverse health implications from exposure to localized UV-C have been addressed. The extremely meager performance of the UR-UVGI at the surface could have been due to the low UV-C intensities observed, which were close to zero at the level of the toilet bowl, irrespective of the types of bacteria being tested. However, lowering the height of installation for the UR-UVGI was not feasible, as the dose of the UV-C would be excessive. Nonetheless, 50% disinfection was found for airborne samples. This result was attributed to the upward motion generated by flushing in the absence of mechanical ventilation. Previous studies have found that bacteria-laden aerosols were detected at heights of 20 cm and 25 cm upon flushing [8, 9] . If mechanical ventilation is operated, higher rates of disinfection can be expected.",

According to previous work by the author [12] , we can assume flushing-generated droplet sizes to be approximately within 1 \u03bcm and 10 \u03bcm. For a standard density spherical droplet, the settling velocities are 3.5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 m/s and 3.05 \u00d7 10 -3 m/s for 1 \u03bcm and 10 \u03bcm, respectively. Assume the settling distance is 10 cm to contaminate a surface, it would take 2800s to 32 s. In practice, for mechanically ventilated toilets, the air exchange rate can be as high as 18 h -1 which leads the residence time to be approximately 200 s. If toilets have no mechanical ventilation, the residence time can be very long, say 30 min. To sum up, it implies that particle sizes at the upper end of the emission range could contaminate surfaces more readily than those smaller particles. However, the thermal plume generated by the toilet user as a result of the convective heat loss from the body, would enhance the air distribution in the toilet stall and further complicate the airflow.",

At the perspective of the current study, if the mechanical ventilation is so high to affect upward airflow, the dose received by the flushed-generated pathogens would be reduced and the pathogens would spread through the toilet without being disinfected. Surface contamination may also be affected. The mechanism of UV-C pathogen inactivation is DNA damage, which results from electron movements. The pyrimidines and purine nucleic acid bases, which are the basic building blocks of DNA, absorb the photons directly from the photoproducts caused by UV-C irradiation [38] [39] [40] . Studies on photoreactivation of various microorganisms have also established that bacteria had developed DNA repair mechanism in an attempt to restore the structure and function of DNA [41, 42] . Once the maximal capacity for DNA repair is reached, additional UV-C exposure is able to kill the micro-organisms, causing an exponential drop in bacteria counts, as depicted by an exponential order of death seen in the survival curves of micro-organisms subjected to UV-C. This pattern might also explain our findings that there were no significant differences in disinfection efficacy between 5 W and 10 W lamps in most of the cases. This finding might also show that a UV-C lamp of less than 5 W is already capable of surpassing the micro-organisms' maximal DNA repair capability, and that additional benefits of stepping up the UV-C to a 10 W rating would be insignificant. Previous studies have also observed that increasing the fluence rate above an effective value did not lead to further improvements in disinfection [31] .",

This outcome also confirmed that source control was more efficient than increasing the power rating. The widespread use of localized UVGI systems would minimize exposure to the pathogens spread to the air during toilet-flushing. Not only would such systems improve the air quality of washrooms, but also no secondary harmful products would be generated as in spray disinfection products. Another feature is the compact size. With the advance of electronic technology, the ballast and the UV-C tube can be made further smaller. Further investigations are recommended to test the effectiveness of such disinfection systems on other types of bacteria, and further improvements may result from more systematic designs and tests of UV-C source systems.",

The physical sizes of localized UV-C devices are smaller, and their levels of electrical power consumption used for disinfection are lower than those of UR-UVGI systems. Comparisons between these two forms of engineering controls showed significant differences in performance. The localized UV-C systems performed two times better than the UR-UVGI for disinfecting airborne samples, and five times better for disinfecting surface samples. The results of this study suggest that maximal disinfection of air in the washroom micro-environment was attained at source control before dispersal than the use of upper-room irradiation for dispersed emitted bacteria throughout the washroom. Inferring from the observed results, we conclude that the use of localized UV-C lamps is a feasible alternative approach for minimizing human exposure to pathogen emissions from toilet plumes.",
