Previous studies of NDV-vectored vaccines in a mouse model suggested their potency after delivery by injection or by the intranasal route. We compared the efficacy of various routes of delivery of NDV-vectored vaccines in a non-human primate model. While delivery of an NDV-vectored vaccine by the combined intranasal/intratracheal route elicited protective immune responses, delivery by the subcutaneous route or the intranasal route alone elicited limited or no protective immune responses, suggesting the necessity for vaccine delivery to the lower respiratory tract. Furthermore, direct comparison of a vaccine based on an NDV mesogenic strain (NDV-BC) with a similarly designed NDV vector based on a modified lentogenic strain carrying a polybasic F cleavage site (NDV-VF) suggested that the two NDV strains were similar in immunogenicity and were equally protective.",

Vectored vaccines are one of the most feasible approaches for achieving protection against infection with such pathogens [reviewed in [1] ]. While the use of human viruses as vaccine vectors may be seriously hampered by pre-existing immunity to these viruses, development of vaccines based on antigenically distinct non-human viruses, such as vesicular stomatitis virus and Newcastle disease virus (NDV), may represent a viable alternative.",

Replacement of the F cleavage site of lentogenic strains with a polybasic site from a mesogenic strain results in a virus whose virulence is intermediate between that of the parental lentogenic strain and the mesogenic strain from which the cleavage site is derived [2, 3] .",

In mice, intravenous (IV), intraperitoneal (IP) or intranasal (IN) immunization with these constructs resulted in a protective immune response [5] [6] [7] . However, because mice are phylogenetically and anatomically distinct from humans, it is unknown whether results obtained with in mice can be extrapolated to potential human use. In particular, the safety and efficacy of live NDV-vectored vaccines will depend on how well this avian virus replicates in the heterologous host, and it is unclear how the level of permissiveness in rodents would compare to that in primates. Additional studies in non-human primates, a model that is more relevant to potential human use, showed that, when administered by the combined IN and intratracheal (IT) routes, NDV is highly attenuated, well-tolerated, immunogenic, and protective [8] [9] [10] , as reviewed in [4] . In the present study, we used a non-human primate model to compare various routes of immunization with NDV-vectored vaccines. In addition, we compared the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of an NDV-vectored vaccine based on a mesogenic strain of the virus with that based on a modified lentogenic strain carrying a polybasic F cleavage site in order to choose the vector representing the best balance of immunogenicity versus veterinary safety.",

We previously modified NDV-BC to express the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein of human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3), creating NDV-BC/HN, and previously modified NDV-BC and NDV-VF to express the spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV, creating NDV-VF/S and NDV-BC/S, respectively [8, 10] . Briefly, the open reading frame encoding the HPIV3 HN protein (accession number Z11575.1) or the SARS-CoV S protein (accession number AAP13441.1) was amplified by PCR and inserted into the P/M junction of the NDV-BC or NDV-VF genome to be expressed as a separate mRNA. NDV recombinants were recovered and amplified in embryonated chicken eggs. Titers of the constructs were determined by plaque titration on monolayers of DF-1 chicken fibroblast cells in 24-well plates.",

In the first study ( Fig. 1) , AGM were immunized with NDV-BC/HN by the combined IN and IT routes or by the subcutaneous (SC) route, at a dose of 10 7 PFU per site. On day 28, animals received a second dose by the same route(s) of either the same construct or the parental NDV-BC lacking an insert. As a negative control, an additional group was immunized on days 0 and 28 with NDV-BC empty vector administered IN, IT, and SC, at a dose of 10 7 PFU per site. This resulted in a total of 4 experimental groups and one control group (see Fig. 1 ) that each contained 4 animals.

Vaccine virus shedding was determined in tracheal lavage (TL) samples taken on days 2, 4, and 6 after the first dose as previously described [11] . To assess serum and mucosal antibody responses, serum, nasopharyngeal wash (NW), and TL samples were collected on days 0, 14, 21, 28, 42, 49, and 56 as previously described [11] . To assess the protective efficacy of the vaccines, all animals in study two were challenged on day 56 by the combined IN and IT routes with 10 6 50%-tissue-cultureinfectious-dose-units (TCID 50 ) of SARS-CoV per site, as previously described [11] . NW and TL samples were collected on days 1 and 2 post-challenge to measure challenge SARS-CoV shedding. Two days post-challenge, animals were sacrificed and triplicate \u223c1 cm 3 sam- mean increase relative to day 0 \u00b1 SE fold for each group. TL samples were collected and concentrated 20-30-fold. They were then analyzed in an IgA isotype-specific ELISA against purified SARS-CoV S starting at a dilution of 1:10 (3.3 log2). The value for each animal was recorded as the log2 of the serum dilution resulting in an absorbance at 450 nm that was more than double the background and greater than 0.1. Values below the limit of detection were assigned a value of 2.3 log2. To account for variability in sample collection and concentration, the titers were then normalized to the total IgA mass in each sample, as determined in a quantitative total IgA ELISA. At day 0, the mean normalized log2 background titer for each group was as follows: ples were taken from seven regions of the lung: the left hilar region, the left upper and lower lobes, the right hilar region, and the right upper, middle and lower lobes. One sample from each tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for immunohistochemical (IHC) and histopathological analysis. The remaining two samples from each organ were homogenized in L-15 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) to achieve a final concentration of 10% (w/v). SARS-CoV titers in the supernatant were determined by titration as described below. Fig. 4 ). The animals were challenged with SARS-CoV on day 56. They were then euthanized on day 2 post-challenge and tissue samples were taken from the indicated regions. Duplicate tissue samples from each animal were homogenized and the viral titers were determined. The mean log10 titer \u00b1 SE for each group is shown. The limit of detection (2 log10) is indicated by a dotted line; titers below the limit were assigned a value of 1.5 log10 TCID50/g. Mean \u00b1 SE values are shown. P values were calculated by comparing the mean titer of the experimental group to that of the control group using a repeated measures two-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni post hoc analysis: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.

Shedding was not detected in animals immunized with NDV-VF/S, suggesting a greater level of attenuation of the NDV-VF versus NDV-BC-based constructs.",

In addition, the mucosal antibody response was analyzed by quantitation of SARS-CoV-specific IgA in TL samples (Fig. 3, panel D) . We detected NDV-specific serum antibody titers beginning at day 14 after the first dose, which gradually increased at the later time points (Fig. 3A) . (Fig. 3C) . Again, NDV-BC/S induced a greater response, as compared to NDV-VF/S. We also observed an increase in SARS-CoV-specific IgA titer in the TL samples of most of the animals that received vaccine by either the combined IN/IT route or the IN route alone (Fig. 3D) . Specifically, all 4 animals that received NDV-BC/S by the combined IN/IT route demonstrated a 3-4-fold increase in TL IgA titer by day 42 that was maintained or increased through day 56. The TL IgA response was less consistent in the NDV-VF/S group, in which only 2 of 4 animals demonstrated a 5-and 18-fold increase in TL IgA on day 42 that had largely waned by day 56. Despite the relatively meager humoral responses, all 4 animals that received NDV-BC/S by the IN route alone demonstrated a 2-7.5-fold increase in S-specific TL IgA that was largely maintained through day 49, but returned to near background levels by day 56. We were unable to detect statistically significant differences between the groups due to the high animal-to-animal variability.",

On days 1 and 2 post-challenge, NW and TL samples were collected to evaluate viral shedding (Fig. 4) , and on day 2 the animals were euthanized and respiratory tract tissues were collected to assess SARS-CoV replication by quantitative virology (Fig. 5) , IHC, and histopathologic analysis (Fig. 6 ). In the control animals, high or moderate titers of SARS-CoV challenge virus were detected in NW and TL samples (Fig. 4) and in respiratory tract tissues (Fig. 5) , SARS-CoV antigen was easily detectable by IHC of lung tissue (Fig. 6 top row; Table 1 ). In the animals immunized by NDV-BC/S or NDV-VF/S by the combined IN/IT route, very little or no SARS-CoV was detected by any of the three methods. In contrast, the group immunized with NDV-BC/S by the IN route alone had a level of SARS-CoV shedding that was indistinguishable from that in the control group, and the titer of SARS-CoV detected by direct analysis of lung tissue was largely indistinguishable from that in the control group in most locations, with a modest reduction seen in some sections. Moreover, the level of viral antigen, as evaluated by IHC, was only marginally reduced as compared to the control group. Histopathological examination of bronchial tissues demonstrated a pronounced loss of cilia and increases in cellular infiltration and necrosis and/or apoptosis of bronchial epithelial cells following challenge of the NDV-BC con- trol as well as in the NDV-BC/S IN-immunized group, while little or no pulmonary pathology was detected in the IN/IT-immunized groups (Fig. 6 , bottom row; Table 1 , NDV-VF/S not shown).",

We therefore infected monolayers of DF-1 chicken embryo fibroblast cells and LLC-MK2 monkey kidney cells with serial dilutions of NDV-BC and incubated the monolayers under methylcellulose at various temperatures for 4 and 12 days, respectively ( Fig. 7A and B) . Following incubation, the plaques were visualized as described in Section 2 and the plaque sizes and numbers were determined. Within the range of the temperatures tested, no significant difference in the viral titer was observed (data not shown). However, a dramatic reduction of the plaque size associated with the reduced temperatures was observed in the DF-1 chicken cells and, to a lesser degree, in LLC-MK2 monkey cells ( Fig. 7A and B) . For example, comparison of plaques sizes at 39 and 32 \u2022 C demonstrated a 77% reduction in size in DF-1 cells and a 43% size reduction in LLC-MK2 cells, suggesting significantly reduced virus growth at lower temperatures. A similarly significant difference was observed when plaques formed at 37 and 32 \u2022 C were compared ( Fig. 7A and B) .

These data suggest that (i) NDV-vectored vaccines require delivery through the respiratory tract, and that parenteral delivery by injection, even with two doses, is ineffective, (ii) for effective respiratory tract immunization, IT delivery is required, and (iii) a mesogenic strain of NDV is only marginally more immunogenic than a modified lentogenic strain containing a polybasic F cleavage site, and the two strains are equally protective. Previously published data in a mouse model demonstrated high immunogenicity and protective efficacy of an NDV-vectored vaccine administered by the IV and IP routes [5] . Although we did not test these particular routes of immunization (because they would not be appropriate for human use), the lack of any detectable response even after two doses delivered by the SC route suggests that delivery through the respiratory tract is a requirement for the immunogenicity of NDV-vectored vaccines in primates. Another study utilizing the mouse model demonstrated greater immunogenicity and protective efficacy with IN immunization, as compared to IV or IP administration [6] . However, as opposed to the primate model, IN inoculation of mice typically results in delivery to both the upper and lower respiratory tract. For example, IN inoculation of 4-week-old BALB/c mice with a 20 l or 100 l inoculum resulted in delivery of 56% or 81%, respectively, of the inoculum to the lungs [15] . Therefore the mouse model does not allow a distinction between vaccine delivery to the upper and lower respiratory tract. Furthermore, the already noted low phylogenetic and anatomic relatedness between the mouse and human necessitate the use of more relevant models for assessment of the optimal routes of delivery for an NDV-vectored vaccine.",

IN delivery has been successfully used to vaccinate humans and non-human primates against human influenza viruses [16] , respiratory syncytial virus [17] , parainfluenza viruses [18] , and vaccinia virus [19] . Why does IN immunization with NDV result in a different outcome? We note that infection of humans or non-human primates with live attenuated vaccines against human influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza viruses results in efficient viral replication in both the upper and lower respiratory tract [17, [22] [23] [24] . In contrast, direct analysis of the respiratory tract (Fig. 2) . Thus, it appears that, in contrast to the human viruses, avian NDV replicates poorly in the upper respiratory tract of primates, a property that could account for its reduced immunogenicity.",

For example, low transmissibility of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in humans was suggested to be related to the lack of its receptor, sialic acid molecules linked to galactose by an \u2423-2,3-linkage, in the human upper respiratory tract [20] . Sialic acid also serves as a receptor for NDV receptor-binding protein HN; however, NDV appears to be less restricted than influenza virus in its requirements for certain modifications of the sialic acid molecule receptors [reviewed in [21] ], and therefore this explanation seems unlikely.",

            "text": "Another possibility is that NDV replicates poorly in the upper respiratory tract of primates due to the lower temperature at that site, reflecting the adaptation of the virus to birds which, as already noted, have a higher body temperature. The idea that NDV is restricted in the upper respiratory tract due to its lower temperature is supported by the significant reduction in NDV-BC plaque size observed in cell culture during incubation performed at lower temperatures characteristic of the upper respiratory tract in primates; in contrast, no reduction was observed for HPIV3, a human respiratory pathogen (Fig. 7) . Moreover, the production of virus during single-and multi-cycle growth experiments was strongly reduced at 32 \u2022 C for NDV-BC and NDV-BC/S but not for HPIV3 (Fig. 8) . This was associated with reduced and delayed production of intracellular NDV antigen at 32 \u2022 C (Fig. 9 ). The observation that the replication of HPIV3 was not reduced at 32 \u2022 C suggests that the reduced expression and replication of NDV at this reduced temperature is an intrinsic property of the virus rather than an artifact due to a reduced cellular metabolism. Thus, the ability of human viruses such as human influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza viruses to efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract provides for spread to the lower respiratory tract, in which dendritic cells and other antigen-presenting cells are abundantly present. In contrast, we suggest that the inefficient antigen expression and reduced virus production of NDV in the upper respiratory tract of primates results in reduced spread the lower respiratory tract and reduced immune stimulation.",

First, since IN delivery alone appeared to be ineffective in a primate model, nebulizer delivery of these vaccines to the lower respiratory tract may be a viable option for subsequent clinical trials. Nebulizer delivery of the measles vaccine to children was found to be safe, effective and inexpensive [25] . Second, since mesogenic and modified lentogenic strains of NDV appeared to be almost equally immunogenic and equally protective, the choice of strain for development of human vaccines should be based on factors other than immunogenicity. Issues such as safety for humans and for the bird population, as well as the ability to grow the virus to high titers in substrates approved for human vaccine production [reviewed in [4] ] will be critical considerations when moving forward into clinical trials with these vaccine candidates.",

All micrographs were captured at 400\u00d7 magnification. Top row: IHC detection of SARS-CoV N protein (S). A significant number of antigen-positive cells are seen in the vector control (left panel), but not the animals immunized with NDV-BC/S by the IN/IT routes (right panel). Antigen-positive cells are also present in animals immunized with NDV-BC/S by the IN route, although at a reduced number (middle panel). Bottom row: Hematoxylin and eosin staining. Features characteristic of SARS-CoV pathogenesis were noted in animals that had been immunized with the empty vector (left panel) or NDV-BC/S by the IN route (middle panel), including marked cellular infiltration (I) of the interstitium and lining epithelium by primarily neutrophils and lymphocytes. In addition, the cilia (C) that are evident in animals previously immunized with NDV-BC/S IN/IT (right panel) are largely absent in animals immunized with the empty vector or with NDV-BC/S IN. Overall, no significant pathological changes were observed in the animals immunized with NDV-BC/S by the IN/IT routes (right panel), whereas animals immunized with NDV-BC/S by the IN route (middle), pathological changes similar to those observed in the empty vector control animal (left) are seen.",
