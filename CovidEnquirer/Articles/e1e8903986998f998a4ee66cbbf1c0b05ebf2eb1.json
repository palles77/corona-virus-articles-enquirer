However, the negative serum of monkey had weak cross-reaction with the recombinant protein ( Figure 6C ). In the negative control, empty vector pET-32a (+) could not be induced to express the gD protein; it did not have a specific band in the western blot analysis (34).",

However, the use of recombinant antigens for BV sero-diagnosis has not been widely investigated, and it has been proposed that the specificity of BV gD is probably a valuable diagnostic reagent for distinguishing herpes B virus infections (23, 39, 40) . The A + T and G + C content, rare codons, AT-rich stretches and mRNA secondary structure are factors that could distinctly affect the expression of foreign genes. According to the analysis of the coding sequence of gD, we found that it consists of GC-rich material. Therefore, we optimized the gene sequence to beneficial to the expression of gD. The results demonstrated that the anti-His mAb and BV positive monkey serum could recognize the purified gD protein specifically ( Figure 6 ). MAbs is one of the valuable tools for specific epitopes and characterization of antigenic variation.",
