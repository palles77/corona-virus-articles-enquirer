Transmission of these viruses primarily occurs through respiratory droplets and indirect contact with secretions from infected persons. Signs and symptoms of illness often include runny nose, headache, cough, sore throat, and fever. LRTI occurs less frequently, but young children, older adults, and persons who are immunosuppressed appear to be at higher risk for these types of infections (1) (2) (3) .",

At the time of notification, the facility reported 11 residents with chest radiograph-confirmed pneumonia. For this investigation, we defined a case-patient as any LTCF resident with respiratory tract symptoms of new onset in November 2017, and we considered LRTI diagnoses that were based on clinical or radiologic evidence. During November 1-18, a total of 20 case-patients (60% male) of a median age of 82 (range 66-96) years were identified. The number of cases of respiratory illness peaked in mid-November. The most common symptoms were cough (95%) and chest congestion (65%). Shortness of breath, wheezing, fever, and altered mental status were also reported (Table) . Sixteen (80%) case-patients had abnormal findings on chest radiograph; pneumonia was noted in 14. All case-patients had concurrent medical conditions; the most common were heart disease (70%, 14/20), dementia (65%, 13/20), hypertension (40%, 8/20), diabetes (35%, 7/20), and lung disease (35%, 7/20). Six (30%) case-patients required hospitalization; all had chest radiograph-confirmed pneumonia.",

Of the 6 specimens negative for HCoV-NL63, 1 was positive for rhinovirus, and 1 was positive for parainfluenza virus 1. For the 6 case-patients hospitalized with pneumonia, median length of hospital stay was 4 (range 1-5) days; none of these case-patients were mechanically ventilated or admitted to the intensive care unit. Nasopharyngeal specimens were available from 2 of the hospitalized case-patients, and HCoV-NL63 was detected in both. HCoV-NL63 respiratory infection was considered a contributory cause in the deaths of 3 case-patients (1 hospitalized and 2 nonhospitalized) that occurred 10-36 days after illness onset.

However, residents often shared rooms, walked throughout the facility, and spent much of their time in shared areas (e.g., gym, dining rooms, and recreational rooms). Because all case-patients had visited the gym at the facility for recreation or physical therapy before becoming ill, environmental cleaning of this area was performed. No new cases among residents were identified after November 18, 2017, and no facility staff members reported respiratory symptoms during this outbreak.",

Clinicians and public health practitioners should consider HCoV-NL63 in patients with similar clinical presentations in these settings. Because of packaging limitations of the protein coat, armored RNAs contain only partial genome sequences, compared with live or inactivated virus preparations such as the WHO ISs, which contain full-length genomes. Consequently, armored RNAs are restricted to controlling only certain assays. However, it may be easier to import armored RNAs into countries where disease outbreaks are occurring because they are noninfectious and have not been derived from either viremic plasma or cell culture-derived virus that has undergone heat inactivation.",

Armored RNAs are RNA transcripts synthesized by in vitro transcription; they are encapsulated in a bacteriophage protein coat and are nuclease resistant. In addition to the external quality assessment samples, laboratories were sent vials of the World Health Organization (WHO) International Standard (IS) for Zika virus, which was prepared by using heat-inactivated virus(2). Concentrations of WHO ISs are defined in IUs, in this case referring to the viral load, and, because of limitations on number of vials prepared in each batch, they are intended for calibrating secondary standards, including calibrators and run controls in IU facilitating comparison of assays (http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/documents/ s23325en/s23325en.pdf). Secondary standards, such as armored RNAs, traceable in IU (in accordance with ISO 17511:2003), are important complementary reagents to WHO ISs. However, the study by Fischer et al. was missing the calibration of the armored RNA in IU, which is essential for traceability.",
