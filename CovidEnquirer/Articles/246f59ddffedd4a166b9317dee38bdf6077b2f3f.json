The single and selective agonism of PPAR\u03b3 is the main cause of these side effects. Multitargeted PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3/\u03b4 pan agonist development is the hot topic in the antidiabetic drug research field. In order to identify PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3/\u03b4 pan agonists, a compound database was established by core hopping of rosiglitazone, which was then docked into a PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3/\u03b4 active site to screen out a number of candidate compounds with a higher docking score and better interaction with the active site. Further, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity prediction was done to give eight compounds. Molecular dynamics simulation of the representative Cpd#1 showed more favorable binding conformation for PPARs receptor than the original ligand. Cpd#1 could act as a PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3/\u03b4 pan agonist for novel antidiabetic drug research.",

The three subtypes of PPARs were 60%-70% sequence similarities with RMSD between C\u03b1 atoms \ue02c1 \u00c5. In addition, the ligand binding domain of the PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3/\u03b4 formed a Y-shaped hydrophobic pocket with a volume of about 1,300 \u00c5 3 . The AF-2 region of H12 helix played an important role in the process of the activation of PPARs. As for PPAR\u03b4, the AF-2 region was significantly narrower, which was not suitable for binding ligands with a larger polar head. 37 core hopping and docking A total of 42,000 compounds were obtained by core hopping of rosiglitazone. These compounds were docked into PPAR\u03b1 (pdb 1I7G), PPAR\u03b3 (pdb 2PRG), and PPAR\u03b4 (pdb 2ZNP), respectively, screening out 23 compounds with higher docking scores and better binding poses than the original ligands. Further ADMET prediction studies produced the top eight compounds ( Table 1 ). The docking scores of these compounds with PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 were higher than the original ligand AZ242 and rosiglitazone, respectively. The docking scores of these compounds with PPAR\u03b4 were somewhat lower than the original ligand TIPP204. In addition, the hydrogen bond distances between compounds and PPARs were \ue02c3.20 \u00c5, 38, 39 and the values were equal to the original ligand.",
