            "text": "be advisable for children considered to be at high risk based on underlying conditions and on the type and length of surgery. 1, 3, 5 The occurrence of VTE is approximately 10 times higher in adults than in children. [1] [2] [3] [4] 6, 10 The lower incidence of VTE in children is a result of, at least in part, the physiological differences in the coagulation systems of adults and children. 1, 2, [4] [5] [6] [7] 9, 11 However, VTE is occurring with greater frequency in the pediatric population. 1, 2, 4, 6 This is most likely a result of the increased survival rates of patients with complex conditions, improved diagnostic tools for identification of at-risk patients, and increased awareness of the need for prophylactic measures. 1, 2, 6 The pediatric patient population ranges from the newborn to the teenager. Within the overall pediatric population, the two age groups at greatest risk for VTE are infants and teenagers. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] 11 These groups account for approximately 70% of pediatric VTE events. 1, 6 A VTE event in an infant typically is related to small blood vessels, an idiosyncratic clotting system, or the use of central venous lines (CVLs). 4, 11 In the teenage population, a VTE event is more closely aligned with factors associated with adult VTE (eg, smoking, oral contraceptive use, pregnancy, obesity). 4, 11 The incidence of VTE appears to be almost equally divided between male and female patients; however, there is a slightly greater frequency of events in teenage girls. 6 Some of the guidelines for prevention of VTE in adult patients are adaptable to the pediatric population; however, the risks and benefits of intended prophylaxis measures should be carefully considered. 3, 5, 6, 11 All pediatric patients should be assessed for VTE risk factors. 2, 4 Notably, the majority of VTE events in children are secondary to serious conditions, such as cancer, trauma, congenital heart disease, thrombotic disorders, and systemic lupus erythematosus, 2, 4, 10 or are related to predisposing factors, such as an indwelling venous catheter. 10 The most common risk factor for VTE in children appears to be the presence of a CVL, 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 11 especially when it is placed in the femoral vein, 1, 4, 11, 12 which suggests that the preferred sites for CVLs may be the brachial or jugular veins. 9, 11, 12 Risk factors associated with VTE in infants, children, and adolescents include cancer and chemotherapy, 2-4,6,10 cardiac catheterization, 3, 5 congenital heart disease and associated surgeries, 3, 4 CVLs, 1-4,6,10 family history of VTE, 3 immobility or prolonged bedrest, 3, 4, 10 infection and inflammatory syndrome, 2-4,6,10 inherited thrombophilia, 2-4,6,10 major burns, 3 major trauma, 3,4,10,11 nephrotic syndrome, 3,4 obesity, 1,3,4,6,10 orthopedic and neurological surgery, 3,10,11 pregnancy, 1,3,6 previous VTE, 3, 4 smoking, 1,3,4,6 and use of oral contraceptives. 1, 3, 4, 6 Based on the pediatric patient's VTE risk factor assessment, the perioperative RN should consult and collaborate with surgical team members and members of other disciplines as appropriate regarding the need for and selection of prophylaxis within the organizational protocol. 13 Implementing mechanical methods of prophylaxis such as early ambulation and adequate hydration is always appropriate for prevention of VTE. 1, 3, 6 The use of graduated compression stockings and intermittent pneumatic compression devices also may be appropriate for VTE prophylaxis in the pediatric population, provided the equipment is properly sized and fitted 1,3,6 and approved by the manufacturer for pediatric use.",

[3] [4] [5] 11 The available evidence does not support the routine use of heparin in pediatric and young adolescent trauma patients. 3, 5 When heparin is indicated, low-molecular-weight heparins are preferred over unfractionated heparin because of the more predictable bioavailability and decreased threat of thrombocytopenia and osteoporosis. 1, 11 Dose recommendations should not be extrapolated from adult doses but should be calculated based on the patient's age and body weight. 1 The rarity of VTE events in children and the lack of controlled, trial-based evidence has led to few indications for VTE prophylaxis in the pediatric population. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Risk assessment for VTE should be considered for all hospitalized children 4 and the use of mechanical methods of prophylaxis implemented when possible. 3 Anticoagulant prophylaxis may be advisable for children considered to be high risk based on underlying conditions and type and length of surgery. 1 We are having a disagreement at our facility about how certain procedures should be documented when using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surgical wound classification system.

This decisionmaking tool can help illustrate how this might occur. For example, a bilateral laparoscopic tubal ligation with uterine manipulation would be classified as class II. 1 However, a bilateral laparoscopic tubal ligation using silicone rings without uterine manipulation would be classified as class I 1 because the wound is clean and the genitourinary tract was not entered. A tonsillectomy would be classified as class II 1 ; however, if the tonsils were found to be purulent, then the procedure would be classified as class IV (ie, dirty, infected). 1 A total joint arthroplasty would be classified as class I 1 ; however, if it were discovered midway through the procedure that the instruments had not been properly sterilized, then the procedure would be classified as class III (ie, contaminated). 1 Similarly, a cholecystectomy procedure would be classified as class II. 1 If gross (ie, visible) spillage of bile occurred, however, then the procedure would be classified as class III, 1 and, if the drainage from the gallbladder was purulent, then the procedure would be classified as class IV. 1 Perioperative nurses can use the Surgical Wound Classification Decision Tree to assist in accurate decision making for surgical wound classification. Using a critical thinking tool rather than a universal listing of categorized surgical procedures allows each step of the wound classification process to be methodically considered to determine the most accurate classification. SHARON A. VAN The purpose of a surgical mask is to cover the user's nose and mouth and to create a physical barrier to fluids and particulate materials. 1 A study involving 8,500 surgical procedures showed that 26% of exposures to blood were to the heads and necks of scrubbed personnel and that 17% of blood exposures were to circulating personnel outside the sterile field. 3 The Occupational Safety and Health Administration Bloodborne Pathogen Standard requires that all health care workers wear appropriate personal protective equipment if they may be exposed to blood and other body fluids. 4 Personal protective equipment will be considered \"appropriate\" only if it does not permit blood or other potentially infectious materials to pass through to or reach the employee's work clothes, street clothes, undergarments, skin, eyes, mouth, or other mucous membranes under normal conditions of use and for the duration of time [in] which the protective equipment will be used. 4 Surgical masks made of cotton or other fabric materials do not adequately protect perioperative team members from inadvertent splashes or splatters of blood and other body fluids.",

            "text": "Although the first surgical masks were made of muslin or linen, cloth masks were replaced in the early 1960s with synthetic materials that provide improved bacterial filtration. Surgical masks protect perioperative team members by filtering droplets greater than 5 micrometers in size. 5 Examples of diseases that produce droplets include group A Streptococcus, adenovirus, and Neisseria meningitides. 5 In the United States, surgical masks are categorized as a class II medical device requiring FDA clearance for marketing relative to fluid resistance and flammability. 1 Surgical mask material must be fluid resistant (ie, able to resist the penetration of blood and body fluids). Masks are tested on a pass/fail basis at three velocities, corresponding to the range of human blood pressure (ie, 80 mm Hg, 120 mm Hg, 160 mm Hg). 1 The FDA recommends that class 1 and class 2 flammability materials be used in surgical masks intended for use in the OR because there are many potential ignition sources in the OR, including surgical lasers, electrosurgical units, endoscopic fiberoptics, and high-energy electromedical devices. 1 Cotton is considered a class 1 material; however, it cannot pass the flammability standards unless it has been treated with a flameretardant chemical. 2 A review of the literature reveals that there are situations in which reusable fabric masks may be required for public use during a pandemic (eg, severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], H1N1 flu) or other situations in which commercial masks might not be available. 6, 7 Any type of mask is likely to decrease microbial exposure and infection risk 6 ; however, the level of protection afforded by reusable cloth masks is uncertain because of variations in material, assembly, and handling. 7 If a perioperative team member appears to have an allergy to disposable surgical masks, then the appropriate action is to consult and collaborate with a member of the organization's infection prevention or employee health department regarding the possibility of testing for chemical allergens. When the specific allergen is identified, the surgical mask manufacturer can be contacted in an effort to identify and purchase masks that do not contain the offending agent. It is important that the team member be aware of any possible allergies because the chemical allergen may also be present in other items used within the department.",

In addition, clean wounds are primarily closed, and if necessary, drained with closed drainage [eg, chest tubes]. Operative incisional wounds that follow nonpenetrating (blunt) trauma should be included in this category if they meet the criteria. [Class 2] Clean-contaminated wounds: These are operative wounds in which the respiratory, alimentary, genital, or urinary tract is entered under controlled conditions and without unusual contamination. Specifically, operations involving the biliary tract, appendix, vagina, and oropharynx are included in this category, provided no evidence of infection or major break in technique is encountered [eg, spillage from gastrointestinal tract]. [Class 3] Contaminated wounds: These include open, fresh, accidental wounds, operations with major breaks in sterile technique [eg, procedure performed with unsterile instruments] or gross spillage from the gastrointestinal tract, and incisions in which acute, nonpurulent inflammation is encountered. [Class 4] Dirty or infected wounds: These include old traumatic wounds with retained devitalized tissue and those that involve existing clinical infection or perforated viscera. This definition suggests that the organisms causing postoperative infection were present in the operative field before the operation. 1",

In most thyroid procedures, there is no reason to restrict the use of povidoneiodine; however, because of the potential for iodine absorption, it may be prudent to restrict the use of povidone-iodine as a skin antiseptic in certain patients.Cases of thyroid dysfunction related to transcutaneous absorption of povidone-iodine in infants 1-4 and burn patients 5, 6 have been reported in the literature. This is likely because of the thin, permeable skin of these patient populations [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] ; the skin of healthy adults is less permeable. 7 In one study involving 68 adult patients diagnosed with thyroid carcinoma who were undergoing total thyroidectomy, however, the researchers found that a large amount of povidone-iodine was absorbed through healthy adult skin. 7 The patients participating in the study were kept on an iodinerestricted diet, and a single, topical application of povidone-iodine was used for preoperative skin antisepsis. 7 Postoperative urinary levels were found to be nearly seven times the preoperative levels. 7 Furthermore, the amount of absorbed iodine correlated positively with the duration of surgery time. 7 Based on the results of this study, it could be theorized that absorbed iodine has the potential to interfere with scintigraphy or radioactive iodine therapy or to cause thyroid dysfunction in susceptible adult patients. 7 According to AORN's \"Recommended practices for preoperative patient skin antisepsis,\" the patient should be assessed for consider-ations affecting skin preparation and contraindications to specific skin-preparation agents. 8 When it is necessary to limit serum iodine levels in a patient, it may be prudent to avoid surgical skin antisepsis with povidone-iodine and restrict iodine from the diet. 7 The perioperative RN should verify with the surgeon the appropriateness of using povidone-iodine solution as the preoperative surgical skin antisepsis for a patient undergoing a thyroid procedure.
