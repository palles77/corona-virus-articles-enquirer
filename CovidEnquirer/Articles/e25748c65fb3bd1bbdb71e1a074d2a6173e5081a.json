However, its very success in this context has tended to obscure the fundamental question, \"What is the role played by viruses in Nature?\" This article is an attempt to examine this issue. Various factors make the task a difficult one: (1) viral taxonomy is still a subject of controversy (see Lwoff and Tournier, 1971 ); ( 2 ) the amount of available data is now so great that one scientist cannot critically assess the validity of every claim; ( 3 ) much of the most pertinent information is so recent that certain key principles must still be regarded as suggestive rather than established; and (4) a further major factor concerning the available information relates to the origins of much of the data. Because of their small size, their haploid state, and their rapid replication rate, the genomes of viruses are in very intimate equilibrium with environmental stress. The act of isolation immediately removes a virus from many of the influences that hitherto determined the character of its genome.",

Reanney and Marsh (1973) examined the population structure of a phage-D5-attacking the soil organism Bacillrrs stearothermophilrrs; in enriched soil where conditions favor virus multiplication, D5 populations often exceeded 108 pfu/gm dry weight of soil. In untreated soil moistened with rainwater, titers were of the order of 103-104 pfu/gm. In other untreated environments, such as compost, D5 titers of 105-106 pfu/gm were obtained. Some ecological studies have been carried out on the phages that parasitize the bacteria that ripen milk into cheese, since these phages are of economic importance. When phage was added to Streptococcus lactis in skim milk, the phage titer rose to 109 pfu/ml (Babel, 1962) . However, in the rzatuval situation in raw milk containing diverse microbial populations, such wholesale lysis has not been observed. Collins (1952) found that the production of lactate by lactic acid bacteria was little affected by phage, even when susceptible bacteria made up 5091 of the total microflora. In a later study, Collins demonstrated that the production of acid by a mixture of three different strains of S. lactis in skim milk was not reduced when any one of the three corresponding phages was added to the culture (Collins, 1955) .",

            "text": "To the extent that these results are a true reflection of the natural situation, it follows that the lytic patterns and very high virus titers that fill texts on virology are artificial products of human manipulation. However, it must be remenibered that laboratory conditions optimize virus multiplication by providing uniquely favorable conditions for host cell growth. In a natural environment such as soil, when the number of plaque-forming units scored for a given phage in a given sample is small, the metabolizing cell population sensitive to that phage is also likely to be small; phage titer has in fact been used to monitor bacterial activity in soil because of this presumed proportionality (Robinson and Corke, 1959; Reanney, 1968) . In view of the fact (Section 11) that there can be a large number of virus types lytic for any given species, it becomes apparent that the number of virus particles in (most) natural environments probably exceeds the number of host organisms. The likelihood that virus populations outnumber those of their hosts is enhanced by the existence of temperate viruses which may only occasionally manifest an infectious character. Few studies on the frequency of occurrence of latent viruses in natural contexts have been made, but it is suggestive that MacPhee et al. (1969) found temperate phages for 5 of 10 strains of Klebsiella tested. It should be noted that failure to isolate a temperate virus for a given organism does not prove that no such virus exists.",

It seems likely (Watson, 1970) that the circular polyoma D N A integrates with host D N A by a mechanism similar to that proposed by Campbell (1962) . The opposite process-encapsidation of host genes by viral capsomeres-has been demonstrated for polyoma. Michel et al. ( 1967) showed that polyoma pseudovirions contain fragments of mouse genome. Subsequently, Qasba and Aposhian (1971 ) demonstrated that polyoma pseudovirions could deliver mouse D N A to human cells. Iurther, Merril et ul. (1971) found that phage I, carrying a functional bacterial Gal transferase gene could initiate transferase activity in human fibroblast cells taken from a patient with a congenital lack of a-D-Gal-I -phosphate uridyl transferase. h-Specific R N A and transferase activity were distinguished at undiminished levels 41 days after infection, suggesting that stable incorporation of the transduced D N A into the human chroniosome(s) had occurred. In these \"transductions\" the D N A s of donor and recipient were separated by many millions of years of evolutionary divergence, so that such interchanges may not occur in nature; but between closely related species or between individuals of the same species, it seems reasonable to assume that such genetic exchanges may occur frequently.",

Gs-negative cells contained as much viral DNA as their gs-positive siblings. Varmus et al. (1972) found multiple copies of avian tumor virus genes in chick and quail cells but not in HeLa cells or salmon sperm. Cells transformed with Rous Sarcoma virus had 15 copies of rapidly reassociating sequences (Varmus et al., 1972) . Interestingly, a similar number of viral genes in chick cells was observed regardless of the degree of expression of viral information. Smith et a1 (1972) found an SV40 abortively transformed line to contain about five virus genome equivalents per diploid cell. Subclones of this abortively transformed line had 2.7 to 10 viral copies per diploid cell. A similar situation obtains for polyoma, but the number of viral copies has been estimated to be as high as 60 (Watson, 1970) .",

Anderson (1970) , in formulating a theory similar in part to that discussed in this article, postulated that a major evolutionary role of viruses was to carry genes across species and phylum barriers. We dispute this. Irrespective of how genes are transferred from cell to cell, the ability of the recipient to incorporate donor genes effectively into its chromosome depends upon the degree of base homology between donor and recipient DNAs. Clearly, the more closely related any two DNAs from different taxonomic sources, the greater the probability of effective assimilation. This may explain the usually strict specificity shown by viruses for particular cells. What is claimed here is that the more rapid adaptive capacity of viral transductants provides a greater flexibility which has surely been exploited by evolution at certain times in certain contexts.",

Either possibility leads rather easily to the concept that the encapsidation of host genes by polyoma protein is more a normal function of the system than an atypical \"mistake\" in the assembly of the virus. If polyoma does fulfill the requirements of the theory, we might expect that its own D N A could integrate into mouse cell chromosomes. It is known that multiple copies of polyoma D N A can lie in tandem in cell D N A s (Watson, 1970) . The presence of these cryptic copies of virus genetic material has been detected only because cells harboring it are trunsformed from normal into cancerous. However, if no such medically obvious effect occurred, it is possible that the virus genes could lie latent in the cell chromosomes without ever being detected. One obvious objection is this. The very act of encapsidating an essential host gene presupposes that this gene will be lost from the host chromosome.

In a truly cryptic type of virus, stimulation of D N A synthesis would be a controlled process and may in fact be coupled to normal replication of the host chromosome. In the case of polyoma, the usual controls have apparently ceased to operate; from this it follows that laboratory strains of polyoma can cause cancer which arises from wzcontrolled DNA synthesis.",

We are specifically thinking of viruses whose RNA is relatively large and whose structure seems to be derived in large part from cell membranes. The \"budding\" process so characteristic of C-type viruses strongly resembles a normal cellular function such as membrane evagination in superficial appearance.

The status of this question is still open, but it is interesting to note that viruslike particles are known that bud from the membranes of the endoplasniic reticulum but which have no demonstrable infectious ability.

The difficulty of envisaging how such a small molecule could effect its own reproduction led Diener to the postulate that the necessary biosynthetic information preexists in susceptible hosts, and that PSTV RNA functions not as mRNA but as \"an abnormal regulatory RNA\" (Diener, 1971) . In this context one notes that two of the nucleus-confined RNAs put forward by Britten and Davidson (1969) as possible candidates for activator RNA (e.g., the RNAs from HeLa cell nuclei and pea seedling nuclei) were only about 40 to 180 nucleotides in length.

Now selection acts not upon the genome of X per se but upon the \"symbiotic\" X-virus genetic interchange. If a particular virus (e.g., virus 5 ) confers upon an individual of X (or more probably an interbreeding group) a slight advantage such that X1 can reproduce more often and/or mvre effectively than the rest of the population, then there will be a slow selection for XI, provided the relevant virus continues to transduce advantageous information ; the process will have a snowball effect, for the more rapidly X1 reproduces relative to the rest of the population, the greater the availability of the relevant virus 5 in the environment.",

But to an extraordinary degree the variety of plant species can be explained on the basis of regulatory changes: modulations in overall size/shape/leaf and stem morphology, etc., do not usually require the introduction of novel proteins, rather alterations in rates and patterns of growth and differentiation. The existence of a pool of regulatory RNAs able to pass from individual to individual or species to species makes good sense in plants as it would maximize rapid adaptability to environmental changes. The essence of this argument is that it is precisely because the structure of higher plants is less inflexibly organized than that of higher animals that virus-transduced regulatory genes are more likely to be effective in producing adaptive change. For example, the introduction of a regulatory RNA that doubles the quantity of tissue produced at a specific stage of differentiation might matter little in a plant whereas to the finely coordinated biology of a vertebrate such a change would be intolerable.",

An advantageous change stimulated in a local part of a plant by a viral RNA could be passed on to progeny by vegetative propagation of that section. If the viral RNA genes were transformed into DNA by reverse transcriptase, the vegetative product could regenerate a plant able to engage in sexual conjugation.
