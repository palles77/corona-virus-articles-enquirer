Additionally, PED outbreaks occurred in Korea and Japan, across the Pacific Ocean, also within 1 year of the US outbreak [11, 12] . The PEDV strain iso lated in the United States was genetically related to the Chi nese PEDV strain reported in 2012 [13] .

US scientists who had not researched PEDV began to study this disease, which had previously not been a problem in Ame ri can. From this, a PED vaccine reflecting the genetic charac teristics of the PEDV strain isolated during the US outbreak was commercialized [14] . Moreover, many veterinary scien tists have focused on the development of more effective PED vaccines because of the major economic losses associated with PED outbreaks. After the US outbreak, sporadic PED out South Korean, piglets < 1 week of age died from severe watery diarrhoea after showing signs of dehydration. After the acute outbreak, piglets were anorectic, depressed, vomiting, and producing water faeces that did not contain any signs of blood. (C) Necropsies of deceased piglets from the Gimpo outbreak uncovered gross lesions in the small intestines, which were typically fluidic, distended, and yellow, containing a mass of curdled, undigested milk. Atrophy of the villi caused the walls of the small intestines to become thin and almost transparent. (D) Yellowish watery diarrhea in sucling piglets after acute infection of PEDV. breaks occurred in Germany. Therefore, European countries were not isolated from the spread of the US PEDV [15] . Thus, the US outbreak was important turning point in PED research, and PED research can be said to be divided into two eras: be fore and after 2013.",

While other genes, such as the gene encoding the M protein and the gene encoded in ORF3 [2325] have been used for phylogeny or molecular epi demiological studies, genetic diversity of the S gene is the fo cus of this review. One of the most interesting characteristics of the S gene is the diversity in this gene that has occurred from the end of 1970s to the present. Genotypes in the S gene of PEDV could be important because this gene may affect the pathogenicity of novel PED outbreaks based on variations in the S gene [3, 1012, 16, 2629] . Moreover, the Chinese PED out break in 2011 involved the presence of new variants based on the nucleotide similarities in the S gene. This variant PEDV exhibited 93% similarity with the CV777 prototype PEDV strain in the S gene [29] . Moreover, the PEDV isolated after the US outbreak also exhibited 89%92% similarity with the S protein of CV777 [26, 27] . Phylogenetic analyses of PEDV RNA have been reported in many previous studies [7, 16, 26, 27, 30] .",

However, the similarities in the S gene, which is re sponsible for the host interaction and normalization, the S1 region in particular could be important in vaccine efficacy and development strategies [7, 17] . Neutralizing epitopes of the PEDV S protein have been investigated [20] . In particular, the CO26K equivalent (COE) is a neutralizing epitope within the CO26K collagenase fragment in transmissible gastroen teritis virus (TGEV) [31, 32] . In the prototype PEDV (CV777) and vaccine strains, certain COEs are different from field iso lates that were isolated after 2011. The different COEs are 549T and 594G in the prototype and vaccine strains, respectively (Table 2) ; however, other COEs that differ from that of CV777 have been shown to be identical to the vaccine strains 83P5 100th or attenuated DR13 [33] . In PEDV isolates acquired af ter 2011 in China, these amino acids were changed to serine; similar observations were made for the PEDV strain from the US outbreak [29] . The new variant PEDV strains have similar mutational patterns for the neutralizing epitope. In contrast, PEDV strains isolated from 2002 to 2009 exhibit different pat terns in 549T and 594G compared to strains isolated after 2011. Interestingly, at amino acid position 549, some strains exhibit no changes; however, in most strains, amino acid 549 is chang ed to arginine (R). Additionally, most strains exhibit a change from G to S at amino acid position 594, similar to current stra ins [22] . In order to elucidate the positive correlations between chan ges in the S protein and virulence or vaccine efficacy, further studies involving animal models are needed.",

In the United States, a deletion in the S gene was also reported after the United States outbreak. In December 2013, a strain with deletion of the S gene was detected and isolated in Ohio [35] . This strain exhibited patterns that were different from those of the Korean strain with the S gene deletion. The US deletion mutant contains a large deletion (197 amino ac ids in length, from amino acid 34 to amino acid 230) in the S1 domain [35] . The effects of deletion in the S protein should be further investigated and are reminiscent of porcine respirato ry coronavirus arising from S protein deletion in the genome of TGEV [34, 35] .",

Primers derived from the M gene can be used in an RTPCR system to obtain PEDVspecific fragments [57] , and duplex RTPCR has been used to differ entiate between TGEV and PEDV [60] . Within the past few years, several useful modifications of the basic RTPCR meth od have been reported. For example, it is possible to estimate the potential transmission of PEDV by comparing viral shed ding load with a standard internal control DNA curve [61] and by multiplex RTPCR to detect PEDV in the presence of various viruses [62] -a technique that is particularly useful for rapid, sensitive, and costeffective diagnosis of acute viral gastroenteritis in swine. The commercial dual priming oligo nucleotide system (Seegene, Seoul, Korea) (Fig. 2) has been developed for the rapid differential detection of PEDV. This system employs a single tube onestep multiplex RTPCR with two separate primer segments to block nonspecific priming [63] . Recently, a proteinbased enzymelinked immunosor bent assay (ELISA) system was developed to detect PEDV. Using this technique, a polyclonal antibody is produced by immunizing rabbits with purified PEDV M gene after its ex pression in Escherichia coli. Immunofluorescence analysis can then be carried out with the antiPEDVM antibody in order to detect PEDVinfected cells among other enteric vi ruses [64] . Another useful reverse transcriptionbased diagnostic tool is RT loopmediated isothermal amplification. This assay, which uses 46 primers that recognize 68 regions of the tar get DNA, is more sensitive than gelbased RTPCR and ELI SA, largely because this method produces a greater quantity of DNA [65] . Immunochromatographic assay kits can be used at farms in order to detect the N (nucleocapsid) protein of PEDV with 92% sensitivity and 98% specificity. Moreover, a rapid technique for differential detection of PEDV and por cine rotavirus (RV) has recently been commercialized and is now widely used in the field (Fig. 3) . This technique is less sensitive than RTPCR, but allows for diagnosis within 10 min utes. Thus, it is particularly effective for quickly determining quarantine or slaughter policies in the field.",

Neonatal pigs are born without ma ternal antibodies if they are not infected in utero, and they should receive passive lactogenic immunity (IgG and IgA) through intake of colostrum and milk to promote survival af ter birth. Therefore, maternalderived immunity at an early age is critical for passive protection of neonatal pigs; for this purpose, immunization of the dam preparturition has been used successfully [66] . IgG is the major immunoglobulin com ponent in pig colostrum, consisting of more than 60% of all immunoglobulins, but is not found in milk. IgA accounts for a substantially reduced percentage of colostrum immunoglob ulin content; however, IgA is more effective than IgG or IgM at protecting animals from orally infected agents because it is more resistant to the activity of proteolytic enzymes in the in testine and has a higher neutralizing ability than IgG and IgM [67] . Bohl et al. [68] and Saif et al. [69] demonstrated that oral inoculation of seronegative sows with live virulent TGEV re sults in high rates of protection in suckling piglets. In these sows, passive protection is associated with high titers of se cretory IgA (sIgA) in colostrum and milk. This investigation suggested the presence of a gutmammary glandsIgA axis; that is, IgA plasmablasts stimulated in the gut by virulent path ogens migrate to the gut lamina propria and mammary glands. Several highly attenuated oral TGEV vaccines, which repli cate lower in the gut, induce poor milk sIgA titers compared with virulent TGEV in sows and result in lower protective effi cacy in piglets [68, 69] . This research could be employed to maternal immunization strategies for PEDV.",

            "text": "For the prevention of PEDV infection, several vaccines have been reported in Asian countries; the predominance of vac cines in Asian countries, but not in Europe or America, is thou ght to be related to the occurrence of severe PED outbreaks and major economic losses in Asia [7] . Commercial PEDV vaccines include live attenuated vaccines and binary ethyl enimine (BEI) inactivated vaccines. Some of these vaccines have been combined with vaccines for TGEV (a bivalent vac cine) and porcine RV (a trivalent vaccine) and used in China and South Korea [7, 25] . Moreover, an attenuated virus vac cine using cell cultureadapted PEDV has been administered to sows in Japan since 1997. Oral vaccination with a cellat tenuated vaccine has been used in South Korea since 2004 and in the Philippines since 2011 [7] . Although these commer cial vaccines are considered effective and have been widely used, not all animals develop solid lactogenic immunity. Sev eral factors are thought to be associated with the poor lacto genic immunogenicity of the commercial vaccine, including the immunizing route of the vaccine. Song et al. [73] demon strated that oral inoculation of PEDVseronegative pregnant sows with live attenuated PEDV reduces the mortality of suck ling piglets more effectively rather than injection after chal lenge, and this protection is associated with elevated IgA con centrations in colostrum and milk. Despite the reduction in mortality rates in piglets delivered from orally vaccinated sows, there was no shortening of the duration of virus shedding and no reduced severity of diarrhea after challenge between vac cinated and control pigs. Thus, some researchers may con clude that passive immunity by vaccination with the highly attenuated PEDV strain DR13 does not prevent virus shedding after challenge. Protection against virus challenge in conven tional pigs is related to the inoculation dose of the virus in the vaccine and the challenge dose of the virulent virus. At low doses of the attenuated PEDV, 25% of pigs are protected against PEDV challenge; however, this proportion increases to 50% when pigs are inoculated with a dose 20 times higher [74] . Moreover, loss of body weight and the content of viral shed ding decrease in orally vaccinated pigs compared with those in intramuscularly vaccinated and unvaccinated pigs follow ing challenge with a low dose of virulent virus (1 LD50, 10 3.0 TCID50/dose). Additionally, the lethal dose of PEDV changes depending on the body weights of the infected piglets and in fection of sows with the challenge virus (data not shown).",

However, PED was transmitted to the United States and subsequently to neigh boring countries, including Mexico and Canada. European countries have also encountered PEDV. Accordingly, with the spread of the PED outbreak area, research on PEDV has in creased rapidly. Veterinarians and veterinary scientists are striving to breakthroughs to combat current PED outbreaks worldwide, and remarkable advances have been made in the relatively short time after the 2013 outbreak.",
