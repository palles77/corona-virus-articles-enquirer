            "text": "disease, a fi nding that, although not previously noted in infl uenza, has been reported for some viral diseases. 15 During the infl uenza pandemic of 1957, which was caused by the H2N2 subtype, individuals who had previously been infected with the H1N1 virus were less likely to be infected with H2N2 infl uenza than were those who had not. 16 The low incidence of severe H5N1 infections in elderly compared with younger people might be related to the presence of cross-protective antibodies to neuraminidase that are induced by seasonal infl uenza A H1N1 viruses. 17 Overall, we postulate that antibodies to pre-1957 infl uenza A H1N1 viruses protected elderly people against pandemic A H1N1 virus infection, but consequently aff ected the development of heterosubtypic immunity and the disease outcome of H7N9 virus infections. The rate and timing of pandemic A H1N1 virus infections might have revealed the diff erences in H7N9 disease outcome, by contrast with historical infections with seasonal infl uenza A H3N2 viruses. This counterproductive imprinting of immunity might increase susceptibility to H7N9 virus infection. For that reason, older individuals should be given priority for vaccination if sustained person-to-person transmission of H7N9 viruses emerges. To obtain a better understanding of the role of imprinting of the adaptive immune system in H7N9 disease severity, prospective cohort studies in which cross-reactive T-cell immunity and virus-specifi c serum antibodies are tested for are imperative before possible wider spread of the virus. Community-acquired pneumonia is a life-threatening disease. An estimated 8% of patients are admitted to intensive care and overall estimated 30 day mortality is 4-11%. 1 Many bacteria and viruses cause community-acquired pneumonia (and can co-infect), and the causative pathogen (or pathogens) cannot be predicatively identifi ed by any clinical, radiological, or biological methods. 2 Accordingly, antibiotic treatment is empirical, and guidelines recommend a combination of a \u03b2 lactam with a macrolide. 2,3 Identifi cation of the causative pathogen is usually delayed because clinical specimens are processed in a core laboratory, which is often in a diff erent centre from the patient and the doctor. Culturing, if done, can also take several days.",

POC diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia relies on immunochromatographic assays for the rapid antigen detection of pathogen-specifi c antigen and realtime PCR tests detecting pathogen-specifi c genomic sequences. Three RT-PCR-based POC tests have been approved by the FDA-GeneXpert Flu A/B (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), Simplexa Flu A/B&RSV (Focus Diagnostics, Cypress, CA, USA), and FilmArray RVP (Biofi re, Salt Lake City, UT, USA).

A metaanalysis 6 showed that urinary detection of L pneumophila had a pooled sensitivity of 0\u00b774 and a specifi city of 0\u00b799. Urinary detection of S pneumoniae had a specifi city of 0\u00b796 and positive predictive value of 0\u00b788-0\u00b796, allowing clinicians to use a narrower spectrum of antibiotics. 7 Rapid antigen detection of the infl uenza virus in nasal or pharyngeal swabs (done in 30 min) has a low sensitivity of less than 0\u00b760; sensitivity correlates with viral load. 8 However, specifi city is around 1\u00b700, resulting in a positive predictive value of more than 0\u00b798-high enough to make a positive result reliable for medical decisions.

However, a liquid direct fl uorescent antibody format (Fast-Point; Diagnostic Hybrids, Athens, OH, USA) is available for POC testing (appendix). It has not been approved by the FDA or the CE, but detects infl uenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, and parainfl uenza virus in 25 min. The latest generation real-time PCR kits can complete molecular testing of swabs for bacterial and viral pathogens in 60 min. 9 New generation real-time PCR kits are typically multiplexed assays testing as many as 22 potential pathogens in parallel. 9 This new capacity of POC tests increases the number of diagnoses 11 and underscores that community-acquired pneumonia can result from co-infection with several pathogens, 10 which will challenge common notions about causation and management. For example, we propose that infl uenza and S pneumoniae have to be tested for in parallel irrespective of which one is the presumed causative pathogen. Furthermore, detection by POC testing of an abnormal increase in group A streptococci might suggest co-infection with infl uenza. 11 Procalcitonin concentrations greater than 0\u00b75 ng/mL suggest bacterial co-infection in infl uenza-a major risk factor for death.",

The rationale for this decision was presumably protection of the public-people who had had sexual intercourse with these sex workers might recognise them and seek medical advice and HIV testing, whereas people who pay for sex could avoid contact with these particular workers. Five of the sex workers were prosecuted for intentional grievous harm-ie, transmission of HIV. The case drew media attention and sparked controversy for a brief period, but was forgotten amid pressing problems related to the economic crisis. On March 11, 2013, the fi ve women were acquitted, but this news did not make headlines.

Notwithstanding the diversity of sex work settings and its many problematic aspects, such as human traffi cking, sex workers' health has gained the attention of policy makers, which is shown by a growing body of published guidelines and strategies. 2 Is the aim of these strategies to protect sex workers or to protect public health via protection of sex workers?
