For patients at risk of asthma, or with existing asthma, viral respiratory tract infections can have a profound eff ect on the expression of disease or loss of control. New evidence has shown that wheezing episodes early in life due to human rhinoviruses are a major risk factor for the later diagnosis of asthma at age 6 years. For those with existing asthma, exacerbations are a major cause of morbidity, can need acute care, and can, albeit rarely, result in death. Viral respiratory tract infections, predominantly those caused by human rhinoviruses, are associated with asthma exacerbations. There is also evidence that defi ciencies in antiviral activity and the integrity of the airway epithelial barrier could make individuals with asthma more likely to have severe viral respiratory infections of the lower airway, and thus increase the risk of exacerbation. In view of the eff ect of respiratory viruses on many aspects of asthma, eff orts to understand the mechanisms and risk factors by which these airway infections cause changes in airway pathophysiology are a fi rst step towards improved treatment.",

The patients were matched with 93 healthy individuals of similar age and sex. When the children were 7\u00b75 years old, those with a family history of both asthma and bronchiolitis had high rates of asthma (38%; 8 of 21 patients) compared with those with a family history of asthma but not bronchiolitis (none of 27 patients).

Follow-up revealed that the timing of birth with respect to the peak of the winter bronchiolitis season was also associated with a high risk for developing asthma. These fi ndings suggest that infants who are at the highest risk for severe viral bronchiolitis are also most likely to develop asthma. Moreover, they suggest that several viral wheezing illnesses during infancy contribute to the development of asthma. At least two prospective birth cohort studies 16, 17 have also documented an association between wheezing illnesses due to RSV infection in early life and the subsequent expression of persistent wheezing and asthma when a child begins school.",

For example, longitudinal data from Tucson Children's Respiratory Study 18 indicate that RSV infections of the lower respiratory tract before a child is 3 years of age are associated with subsequent wheezing and asthma in early childhood, but not beyond age 11 years. Furthermore, Thomsen and coworkers 19 assessed the association between admission to hospital due to RSV infection and development of asthma based on a twin registry in Denmark. They concluded that severe RSV infections do not cause asthma but, instead, that a genetic predisposition to both RSV bronchiolitis and asthma exists.",

            "text": "HRVs are the cause of the common cold and are the viral pathogens that most frequently cause respiratory tract infections, but they are not limited to the upper airway tract. Studies in several countries have implicated HRV infections as the cause of bronchiolitis that results in respiratory compromise severe enough to require admission to hospital. 20, 21 HRVs might have an important role in asthma because they are the most common viral respiratory infection in early life and can infect the lower airways. 22 Many factors have led to a better understanding of the part HRVs can play in the development of asthma. First, molecular techniques are now available to detect HRV in respiratory secretions. 23, 24 These techniques are highly sensitive and specifi c, and can use secretions obtained via non-invasive techniques, such as a nose blow into a plastic bag. 25 Second, PCR methods can detect small amounts of virus that might not be detected by culture. Third, when HRV or other viruses are detected, the viral load can be measured; large viral loads will lead to a more symptomatic infection and a greater likelihood of asthma exacerbation compared with small viral loads. 26 Finally, to diff erentiate between the many HRV strains has now become possible and, as will be discussed later, this ability has led to the discovery of a new species, which might be strongly associated with wheezing illnesses and asthma. 25, 27, 28 To more precisely study and identify the role of respiratory viruses in the development of asthma, Lemanske and colleagues 29 established a birth cohort of children at high risk for asthma. These children had at least one parent with asthma or allergic disease. The Childhood Origins of Asthma (COAST) study was initiated in 1998, with 289 children enrolled between 1998 and 2000. Nasal lavage specimens were obtained from the children at well child visits during their fi rst year of lifeat 1, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months of age-and whenever they had a symptomatic respiratory infection. For the next 5 years, nasal lavage specimens were taken only when a child had symptomatic respiratory illnesses. When the children were 3 years of age, the investigators assessed the frequency of persistent wheezing. 30 Then at age 6 years, the 259 children remaining in the study were tested for asthma. With this study design (fi gure 2), the investigators were able to determine associations between respiratory illnesses with early life wheezing and the eventual development of asthma. The diagnoses of asthma were determined independently by four clinician investigators, in a blinded fashion and on the basis of fulfi lling several clinical criteria: diagnosis of asthma by a physician; frequent albuterol or asthma-controller medication use; a step-up plan during illness; with or without oral prednisone use for an asthma exacerbation. 16 On the basis of these prestudy criteria, 28% (n=73) of the children were diagnosed with asthma at age 6 years. In the fi rst 3 years of the COAST study, 454 wheezing respiratory illnesses were recorded and, in 97% of these episodes, nasal specimens were obtained. In 90% of specimens obtained, a viral cause was noted. HRV was recorded in 48% of the specimens and RSV in 21% of the specimens. Of 73 children identifi ed with asthma, 48% (35) had intermittent asthma, 34% (25) had mild persistent asthma, and 18% (13) had moderate persistent asthma.",

The frequency of asthma was highest in infants with both sensitisation and HRV-related wheezing. Aeroallergen sensitisation did not increase the risk for asthma if an infant had wheezing in the fi rst year of life. When these comparisons were made in the third year of life, HRV-related wheezing had a greater eff ect on asthma risk (25\u00b76 [8\u00b72-79\u00b76]) than had aeroallergen sensitisation (3\u00b74 [7\u00b77-6\u00b79]).

            "text": "For decades, respiratory infections were suspected to be the major cause of asthma exacerbations. Initially, bacterial infections were thought to cause asthma exacerbations, but there was little evidence to support this theory. Before the development of PCR technology, the cause of respiratory infections associated with exacerbations was established by cultures, which are diffi cult to do and do not often support HRV growth. Despite the recent evidence that HRVs are the main asthma-causing respiratory infection, less than 50% of asthma exacerbations were associated with respiratory infections, including HRV. 37 The advent of PCR technology increased the number of respiratory viruses that could be detected; the methods were highly sensitive and specifi c but were not quantitative. In 1995, Johnston and colleagues 6 recruited 108 children who were 9-11 years of age and had asthma. They were assessed for 13 months. At the onset of a respiratory tract infection, or when asthma worsened, respiratory tract samples were obtained and tested with PCR-based viral diagnostics. Viral respiratory tract infections were detected in association with 85% of the asthma exacerbations. Nearly two-thirds of the infections were due to HRV. Similar associations between asthma exacerbations and viral respiratory tract infections, especially those caused by HRV, have also been recorded in adults. 9,10 Thus, the development and application of PCR assessment has enabled a more precise identifi cation of respiratory viruses associated with asthma exacerbation and focused research mainly on the role and contribution of HRV. This striking association was pivotal in bringing this virus to the forefront of asthma research.",

Infection caused upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms that were of greater duration and severity in children with allergic asthma than in those with non-allergic asthma. Furthermore, viral infections were more likely to cause a loss of asthma control in children with allergic asthma than in those with non-allergic asthma.

HRVinduced interferon-\u03b3 responses were reported to be inversely associated with viral shedding. 51 There is evidence that mononuclear cell production of interferon-\u03b1 and interferon-\u03b3 might be impaired in asthma, 52 and that HRV-induced interferon-\u03b3 responses in individuals with asthma are positively associated with measures of pulmonary function. 53 Furthermore, in airway sputum cells, an increased Th1 response (ratio of interferon-\u03b3 to interleukin-5 mRNA), was associated with mild colds and rapid clearance of the virus. 54 In addition to these diff erences in interferon responses of mononuclear and sputum cells, there is evidence that epithelial-cell interferon responses are diminished in asthma. Wark and colleagues 30 used bronchoscopy to obtain bronchial epithelial cells for culture from individuals with and without asthma. These cells are highly relevant to an individual's susceptibility to infection because they are the primary site for an HRV infection in the lower airway. The investigators reported HRV-16 replication to be increased and interferon-\u03b2 responses to this virus to be diminished in bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatic patients (fi gure 5). The addition of interferon-\u03b2 to the HRV bronchial epithelial cell cultures from asthmatic individuals reduced virus replication. Similarly, Contoli and co-workers 31 recorded decreased interferon-\u03bb responses in bronchoalveolar airway cells from the same asthmatic individuals. Additionally, after inoculation with HRV-16, a fall in lung function (ie, forced expiratory volume in one second) was inversely proportional to interferon-\u03bb generation previously noted (fi gure 6). These data suggest that airway cells in some asthma patients have defective antiviral responses, as evidenced by reduced generation of interferons to HRV-16.",

[57] [58] [59] Many factors can contribute to these diff erences in observations, especially the severity of asthma in an individual under investigation. Consequently, additional studies of patients with asthma and naturally acquired colds will be needed to resolve these diff erences. The mechanisms that contribute to changes in lower airway infl ammation and altered pulmonary physiology with respiratory infections are also poorly understood. To address these issues, Message and colleagues 59 assessed responses to HRV infection in asthmatic patients and healthy volunteers. Innoculation with HRV induced similar illness in both groups, but substantially increased lower respiratory symptoms, lung function impairment, bronchial hyper-reactivity, and eosinophilic lower airway infl ammation in asthmatic individuals compared with healthy controls. In asthmatic, but not healthy, individuals, the virus load was strongly associated with lower respiratory symptoms, bronchial hyper-reactivity, and reductions in blood total and CD8+ lymphocytes; lung function impairment was strongly associated with neutrophilic and eosinophilic lower airway infl ammation. The same virological and clinical outcomes were strongly related to defi cient interferon-\u03b3 and interleukin-10 responses and to augmented interleukin-4, interleukin-5, and interleukin-13 responses. The augmented generation of the Th2 cytokines interleukin-4, interleukin-5, and interleukin-13 suggests a possible link, or risk factor, between allergic sensitisation and susceptibility to HRV infection.",

            "text": "One of the most consistent fi ndings in clinical studies of asthma is that allergy and viral infections synergistically increase the risk for acute exacerbations. For example, Heymann and co-workers 8 investigated the presence of viral respiratory tract infections in infants and children admitted for wheezing and the relation of the patient's atopic status to their asthma episode. In children aged 3-18 years, there was a distinct seasonal pattern, with the largest percentage of children admitted between September and November. For the children aged 3 years and older, HRV was the predominant respiratory virus detected in those admitted for wheezing (61% vs 21% in controls). Additionally, the wheezing children had substantially higher serum IgE values than did healthy controls (geometric means: 386 IU/mL vs 38 IU/mL), and 84% of the children with wheezing were sensitised to at least one aeroallergen in their test panel. These data suggest that allergic sensitisation, at least of children, is an important risk factor for wheezing with an HRV infection, and that IgE-dependent responses might also contribute to the development of wheezing with a cold. Additional studies in children and adults indicate that allergic individuals who are exposed to allergens have the highest risk for virus-induced wheezing and asthma exacerbations. 60, 61 Johnston and Sears 62, 63 have been instrumental in recognising and describing the September epidemics of asthma, which happen regularly in the northern hemisphere, and how these events might provide novel insights into both host and environmental factors that lead to asthma exacerbations. In Canada, the sharp increases in emergency department visits for acute asthma and admissions for childhood asthma have been predictable year-to-year. As these investigators point out, aeroallergens, air pollution, and interactions with climate can aff ect asthma exacerbations. To test the hypothesis that asthma exacerbations at the beginning of the school year were related to viral respiratory infections, these researchers assessed children presenting to an emergency department during 3 weeks in September along with community-recruited children with equally severe asthma who did not require acute care. 62 For 62% (n=52) of the children with asthma visiting emergency departments, a respiratory virus was identifi ed by PCR detection methods; respiratory viruses were identifi ed in only 41% (n=150) of controls. Detection of respiratory viruses this frequently during September probably indicates a high prevalence of the virus at this time of the year. As the researchers note, the beginning of the school term is often associated with high stress levels and increased concentrations of aeroallergens in the environment. They conclude that although a viral infection can be the immediate trigger for an asthma exacerbation, these factors are likely to act together to cause the September epidemic.",

            "text": "These clinical observations have led to several theories attempting to explain how respiratory viruses interact with allergic infl ammation to cause wheezing illnesses. Both viral infections and allergic infl ammation can damage airway epithelium, which can exacerbate morbidity. On one hand, viral infections weaken the barrier function of the airway epithelium, which can lead to enhanced absorption of allergens and irritants across the airway wall and increase allergic infl ammation. 64 On the other hand, HRV replication in vitro is greater in damaged epithelium than in undamaged epithelium, which implies that allergen-induced damage to airway epithelium could promote viral replication and lead to severe clinical illness. 65, 66 This notion could also apply to pollutants and explain why exposure to toxic agents (eg, tobacco smoke, nitrogen dioxide) also increases the risk of viral wheeze. 67, 68 Additionally, airway epithelium in Individuals with asthma Healthy individuals asthma has distinct features, including increased numbers of mucus-secreting goblet cells; there is laboratory evidence that HRV replication is enhanced in these cells. 69 Recent mechanistic studies have provided evidence of an antagonistic relation between allergic infl ammation and antiviral immunity. For example, allergic infl ammation can inhibit innate immune interferon responses under specifi c conditions. 70 Gill and colleagues 71 suggest that cross linking or engagement of IgE receptors on peripheral blood dendritic cells-a major contributor to innate immune host defence pathways-leads to inhibition of virus-induced interferon-\u03b1 secretion. 71 Dendritic cells can also have a key role in allergic sensitisation, by directing the development of naive T cells into Th1 rather than Th2 cells; Th2 cells secrete cytokines that lead to IgE production (interleukin-4, interleukin-13) and eosinophilic infl ammation (interleukin-5). Both HRV infection and allergic infl ammation induce epithelial cells to secrete thymic stromal lymphopoietin, a cytokine that can act on a various types of cell, including dendritic cells, to promote Th2 diff erentiation, thereby enhancing allergic infl ammation. 72 Studies in animals suggest that biased innate immune responses to respiratory viruses encountered in early life could establish overproduction of key cytokines such as interleukin-13, leading to suboptimum antiviral responses, an increased risk for respiratory allergies, and changes in airway structure to promote asthma. 73 Finally, in an elaborate set of studies, Subrata and coworkers 74 assessed the hypothesis that underlying interactions between immunoinfl ammatory pathways related to aeroallergen exposure and respiratory viruses are implicated in determining and defi ning severe asthma exacerbations in children. 67 children were recruited at the time of emergency treatment for an acute asthma exacerbation. Postnasal aspirates were obtained along with blood samples for microarray assays of cells during the acute and convalescent period, and leucocyte phenotypic features were analysed by fl ow cytometry. 80% of the children had a respiratory virus detected, with HRV accounting for 95% of the infections. Circulating lymphocytes were decreased, whereas monocyte and dendritic cell populations had upregulated expression of the chemokine receptor CCR2 and an enhanced potential to provoke infl ammation when recruited to the lung. These cells also had an upregulated expression of Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 (a high affi nity receptor for IgE) with a concomitant gene expression signature that is representative of the interleukin-4/interleukin-13-dependent, alternatively activated phenotype.",

Thus, underlying allergic disease seems to be either a risk factor for wheezing with a cold or might lay the foundations that enable the respiratory virus to interact with airway epithelium and start the processes leading to an asthma exacerbation. Determination of these interactive events promises to provide insight not only to mechanisms of asthma provoked by respiratory viruses, but also clues to more eff ective treatment.",
