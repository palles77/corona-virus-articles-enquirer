Their limited genetic variability and increased exposure to domestic animals such as dogs place them at risk of further losses from infectious diseases. In India, domestic and feral dogs are associated with villages in and around protected areas, and may serve as reservoirs of pathogens to the carnivores within. India's Kanha Tiger Reserve (KTR) is home to a number of threatened and endangered mammalian carnivores including tiger (Panthera tigris), leopard (Panthera pardus), wolf (Canis lupus), and dhole (Cuon alpinus). It also has more than 150 villages with associated dog populations. We found that dog populations ranged from 14 to 45/village (3.7 to 23.7/km 2 ), and did not vary with village area, human population size, or distance from the KTR's core area, though they all increased between summer 2014 and winter 2015, primarily through reproduction. No dog tested positive for rabies but seroprevalence levels to three other generalist viral pathogens were high in summer (N=67) and decreased somewhat by winter (N=168): canine parvovirus (83.6% to 68.4%), canine distemper virus (50.7% to 30.4%) and canine adenovirus (41.8% to 30.9%).",

Wild carnivores frequently entered the villages, as shown by tracks, scats, kills and other indicators, and the dogs are known to leave the villages so that encounters between dogs and wild carnivores may be common. We conclude that there is a large population of unvaccinated dogs in and around Kanha Tiger Reserve, with high levels of seroprevalence to pathogens with broad host ranges and these dogs which interact with wild carnivores, therefore posing a high risk of disease spillover to the wild carnivores.",

All these villages support dog populations (DeFries, Karanth & 27 Pareeth, 2010) . In India, dogs near protected areas threaten wild animals through predation and 28 competition (Home, Bhatnagar & Vanak, 2017) ; and may serve as reservoirs of pathogens that 29 threaten wild carnivores. Majority of dogs in KTR are semi-owned and associate with household 30 but are unrestrained. A few are owned and restrained, and the rest are feral. No village dogs were 31 vaccinated (V.

            "text": "Carnivores in KTR frequent the villages to prey on dogs (Karanth et al., 2013) and 34 livestock (Miller et al., 2015) , while dogs enter the core with or without their owners. As a 35 result, these animals can interact directly through scavenging on carcasses or predation or, 36 indirectly through scats or spray marks; in ways that can transmit pathogens. We predict that 37 these interactions will be more frequent in villages that are closer to the core (as in Chile) (Torres 38 & Prado, 2010) or that are larger since they may support more dogs. Finally, as some pathogens 39 have common routes of transmission or suppress the immune response, we predict that there will 40 be elevated rates of co-exposure, amplifying the threat (Griffiths et al., 2011) . We conducted 41 6 contact rate with wild carnivores. We randomly selected five villages with centers < 2 km from 70 the core boundary (henceforth 'near') and four villages (summer), and then five (winter) with 71 centers > 6 km from the core boundary ('far') ( Fig. 1) . All villages were sampled in both 72 seasons except one near village that was replaced in winter and one far village that was added in 73 winter (Table 2) . After establishing the active periods for dogs (6:00-9:00 AM & 5:00-6:30 PM 74 in summer; 7:00-9:00 AM & 4:00-5:30 PM in winter), we conducted non-invasive photographic 75 surveys of dogs using a Nikon D3000 digital camera and 80-200 mm lens, on a motorcycle at < 76 20 km/h on roads and on foot in alleys. We noted individual dog's sex (males by descended 77 testicles), age category (juveniles < 1 year or adults by asking the owners and/or estimation), and 78 coat patterns. Each survey was conducted over two consecutive days (a \"mark\" and \"recapture\" 79 in each village) in summer and three consecutive days (a \"mark\" and two morning and two 80 afternoon \"recaptures\") in winter. We measured the area of each village by tracking its villages that were sampled in summer and winter; the inset shows the location of KTR in India. 88 We collected blood samples from dogs in all surveyed villages to estimate the 89 seroprevalence of rabies, CPV, CDV, and CAV. In summer, we collected blood 90 opportunistically from 67 dogs (42 males and 25 females). In winter, we collected blood from 91 five male and five female adults and four male and four female juveniles from each village, 92 except for three near and two far villages where we could only capture three males and three 93 female juveniles. 35 dogs were sampled in both seasons.

Since, the dogs are territorial (Pal, 2003) and our surveys were conducted over 132 two or three consecutive days in each village, we assumed the individual populations were 133 closed during survey. Also, since we used non-invasive means to identify dogs, we assumed 134 there was no loss of marks and no change in behavior following the first \"capture\". Using 135 CAPTURE, we compared four models that differ in their assumptions of capture probability: that We used Fisher's two-tailed exact test to examine the relation between seroprevalence of 148 each pathogen and sex and age category of the dogs, and also to test non-random patterns of co-149 exposure. We tested for the difference in seroprevalence for near and far villages (only for 150 winter). We calculated odds ratio (OR) for all significant relationships, which tells the likelihood 151 of seroprevalence given the presence or absence of other conditions, here, the sex and age class 152 of the dogs, and the presence of other pathogens.

Our surveys had a single recapture in summer and four recaptures in 229 winter, and yielded slightly higher estimates than the observed number of dogs in each village, 230 with small standard errors. This indicates that most dogs were observed and identified in the 231 surveys. The densities that we estimated, of 3.7 to 17.1 dogs/km 2 in summer and 5.4 to 23.7 232 dogs/km 2 in winter, are higher than those from villages in the Sikhote-Alin Biosphere 233 Zapovednik in Russia (5/km 2 , Gilbert et al., 2015) but much lower than those from villages of 234 the Great Indian Bustard Sanctuary (GIB) in India (719 dogs/km 2 , Belsare & Gompper, 2013). 235 This may be due to the much larger human population of surveyed villages in GIB supporting 236 dogs (2,973 -7,448) and the absence of leopards (Belsare & Gompper, 2013) which can prey on 237 dogs (Athreya et al., 2016). 238The abundance of dogs per village did not vary with the area, human population size, or 239 distance of the village from the core. The proportions of females and of juveniles, also did not 240 vary significantly with any of these variables. Males were always more abundant than females, 241 suggesting either higher survival or activity rates(Acosta-Jamett et al., 2015).

These high values reflect the hardiness of CPV, which can survive in the environment for 253 months, and can be transmitted through contaminated soil and arthropodic vectors (Bagshaw et 254 al., 2014). Seroprevalence in juveniles was higher in winter (72% compared to 56.2% in 255 summer) suggesting that it quickly colonizes susceptible hosts, helping ensure its persistence in 256 the population. CPV seroprevalence was higher in the near villages, where carnivores enter 257 frequently (Miller et al., 2015) and may get infected. Of the dogs that tested positive for CPV, 258 the greatest number had S4+ titers suggesting that they have suffered from mild disease with 259 complete recovery. This also suggests that these dogs may have had repeated exposure to the 260 virus and have recovered. 261 CDV seroprevalence was also high (50.7% in summer, 30.4% in winter) and at rates 262 comparable to those found in Chile (47%: Acosta-Jamett et al., 2015) but lower than those found 263 in GIB (73%: Belsare & Gommper, 2013) and Uganda (100%: Millan et al., 2013). It was also 264 low compared to CPV in KTR. This could either mean that the transmission of the CDV is low 265 in the region or the resulting mortality is high. CDV seroprevalence in near villages in winter 266 (17.7%) was much lower than in far villages (42.9%), making dogs in near villages susceptible to 267 an epidemic of CDV when the conditions for virus become favorable. Proximity of the 268 for days, and infected dogs can excrete the virus in urine for at least 6 months 272 (Greene, 1994). Seroprevalence of both CDV and CAV were higher in summer, primarily 273 because of much higher seroprevalence in juveniles in summer than in winter. Despite evidence 274 of exposure of CPV and CAV in KTR dogs, the PCR analyses detected active infection of CPV 275 and CDV in just four animals. It should be noted that seroprevalence can vary with many factors 276 including sex, as pathogens may infect one gender more than the other (Sheridan et al., 2000), 277 interactions in the host community, and existing infections (Glen & Dickman 2005). High 278 seroprevalence may indicate high transmission rates of the pathogen and/or high post-exposure 279 survival rates. To decipher this difference, long term monitoring of the population is required 280 281 Pathogens such as CDV have complex relationships with the host and their pathogenesis 282 differs significantly based on the region. CDV infections have resulted in mortality of lions in 283 the Serengeti region (Roelke-Parker et al., 1996), however in southern Africa, lions have existed 284 with CDV without any significant impact despite high exposure (Alexander et al., 2010). One of 285 the factor responsible for the difference is co-infection as the mortality of lions in Serengeti was 286 due to CDV's association with Babaesia (Munson et al., 2008). Co-infection is an important 287 factor in mass die-offs (Goller et al., 2010) and we observed a statistically significant association 288 between the seroprevalence of each of the pathogen with the other two in dogs of far villages in 289 winter. The co-infection can be facilitated through common mode of transmission of pathogens 290 or through immunosuppression (Sykes, 2010) and enablement of secondary infections (scope of this study. However, the complex disease dynamic of generalist pathogens 293 such as CDV and associated viruses make further research essential for understanding the 294 disease ecology of dogs and carnivores in KTR. 295 Pathogen spillover from dogs to carnivores in KTR is highly likely as our results confirm 296 the presence of carnivores in the surrounding villages primarily in near villages. These observed 297 contact rates reflect minimum values, as they do not include undetected carnivore signs. Though 298 prohibited, villagers and their dogs enter core zone occasionally and this is true of other 299 protected areas in India as well, where carnivores are surrounded by densely packed human 300 habitations and associated dog populations. Disease transmission in a multi-host system is 301 greater than single host system (Craft et al., 2008) and transmission depends on contact rate, 302 social behavior, and spatial distribution of hosts (Dobson, 2004). This has serious implications 303 for the carnivores of KTR, as dogs here are carriers of pathogens, are largely unrestrained and 304 can infect wild carnivores. Unrestrained dogs, irrespective of the ownership status, form about 305 75% of the global dog population (WSPA, 2011) and pose threat to wildlife. Feral dogs in 306",

Anthropogenic 321 activities have led to decline in species with important ecosystem services such as vultures, 322 which further enhances risk of disease spillover. Vultures rapidly scavenge carcasses thereby 323 limiting the spread of pathogens (DeVault, Rhodes & Shivik, 2003) and decline in vulture 324 population (Accipitridae & Cathridae family) increases pathogen transmission between 325 carnivores and dogs as overall time spent scavenging is higher and contact between different 326 carnivore species is greater (Ogada & Buij, 2011). This may be true for KTR as well, since 327 vulture sightings there decreased dramatically from initial observations in 2004 until the time of 328 this study (A. B. S. and D.T., pers. observation). 329 Our results show that dogs in KTR are abundant, are exposed to CPV, CDV and CAV, 330 and come in frequent contact of carnivores. Despite the low densities, these dogs have high 331 turnover adding constant susceptible hosts of the pathogens, maintaining the risk of disease 332 spillover to wild carnivores (Gascoyne et al., 1993; Roelke-Parker et al., 1996). Epidemic 333 events also depend on immunological status and exposure of the pathogen to wild carnivores. 334 We detected exposure of CPV and FPV in one tiger in KTR (Chaudhary et al., in prep), and we 335 recommend continued surveillance of wild carnivore for these pathogens. There is a need of 336 continued investigation of ecology of KTR dogs including their movements patterns and 337 rates in KTR, as these estimates are essential to develop disease-dynamic 338 models. Based on our findings we recommend management of infection risks posed by dogs in 339 KTR to prevent pathogen spillover to carnivores. Management options could include culling and 340 vaccination of dogs. Culling though useful to control diseases (Barlow, 1996), can result in 341 compensatory recruitment of dogs and raises ethical concerns in India. Vaccination of reservoir 342 population is an effective management strategy and has resulted in the elimination of diseases 343 like rabies in western Europe and the Serengeti ecosystem (Cliquet 2004; Lembo et al., 2010). 344 Specifically, for population with low pathogen exposure like in KTR (for CDV and CAV), 345 vaccination can be beneficial (Belsare & Gompper, 2015). Combination of vaccination and 346 contraception in dogs reduces disease spread (Carroll et al., 2010) and we recommend the use of 347 oral baiting to deliver both kinds of compounds for disease control in dogs in KTR. , G., et al.
