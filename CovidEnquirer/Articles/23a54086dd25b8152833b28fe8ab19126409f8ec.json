            "text": "The effect of colostral maternal antibodies (Abs), acquired via colostrum, on passive protection and development of systemic and mucosal immune responses against rotavirus was evaluated in neonatal calves. Colostrum-deprived (CD) calves, or calves receiving one dose of pooled control colostrum (CC) or immune colostrum (IC), containing an IgG1 titer to bovine rotavirus (BRV) of 1:16,384 or 1:262,144, respectively, were orally inoculated with 10 5.5 FFU of IND (P[5]G6) BRV at 2 days of age. Calves were monitored daily for diarrhea, virus shedding and anti-BRVAbs in feces by ELISA. Anti-rotavirus Ab titers in serum were evaluated weekly by isotype-specific ELISA and virus neutralization (VN). At 21 days post-inoculation (dpi), all animals were euthanized and the number of anti-BRV antibody secreting cells (ASC) in intestinal and systemic lymphoid tissues were evaluated by ELISPOT. After colostrum intake, IC calves had significantly higher IgG1 serum titers (GMT \u00bc 28,526) than CC \u00f0GMT \u00bc 1195\u00de or CD calves \u00f0GMT < 4\u00de. After BRV inoculation, all animals became infected with a mean duration of virus shedding between 6 and 10 days. However, IC calves had significantly fewer days of diarrhea (0.8 days) compared to CD and CC calves (11 and 7 days, respectively). In both groups receiving colostrum there was a delay in the onset of diarrhea and virus shedding associated with IgG1 in feces. In serum and feces, CD and CC calves had peak anti-BRV IgM titers at 7 dpi, but IgA and IgG1 responses were significantly lower in CC calves. Antibody titers detected in serum and feces were associated with circulation of ASC of the same isotype in blood. The IC calves had only an IgM response in feces. At 21 dpi, anti-BRV ASC responses were observed in all analyzed tissues of the three groups, except bone marrow. The intestine was the main site of ASC response against BRV and highest IgA ASC numbers. There was an inverse relationship between passive IgG1 titers and magnitude of ASC responses, with fewer IgG1 ASC in CC calves and significantly lower ASC numbers of all isotypes in IC calves. Thus, passive anti-BRV IgG1 negatively affects active immune responses in a dose-dependent manner. In ileal Peyer's patches, IgM ASC predominated in calves receiving colostrum; IgG1 ASC predominated in CD calves. The presence in IC calves of IgG1 in feces in the absence of an IgG1 ASC response is consistent with the transfer of serum IgG1 back into the gut contributing to the protection of the intestinal mucosa. #",

In addition, high titers of passive circulating Abs have been shown to have a complementary role in protection against BRV diarrhea due to transfer of serum IgG1 into the intestine of neonatal calves (Besser et al., 1988a,b; Saif et al., 1983 Saif et al., , 1987 . A direct correlation between virus neutralizing (VN) Ab titers in serum of neonatal beef calves and protection against BRV disease under field conditions, has been described (Kohara and Tsunemitsu, 2000) . Serum antibodies are essential in dairy calves which are separated from their dams after colostrum intake and fed subsequently with milk replacers lacking antibodies. Due to the significant economic losses caused by BRV infection in cattle, an inactivated vaccine, administered to pregnant cows has been used extensively since the middle 1980s . Immunization of dams greatly increases Abs in colostrum; and using effective vaccines by the intramammary route milk Abs are also increased Kim et al., 2002; Saif and Fernandez, 1996; Saif et al., 1984) . Hence, protection against diarrhea in neonatal calves born to vaccinated cows might be related to passive maternal Abs in serum acquired by intake of colostrum in dairy calves, and both serum (colostral) and intestinal (milk) antibodies for suckling beef calves.",

            "text": "The kinetics of primary antibody responses of different isotypes to BRV, as well as VN Ab responses have been described in colostrum-fed and colostrumdeprived gnotobiotic and conventional calves (Fernandez et al., 1998; Saif et al., 1983 Saif et al., , 1987 Saif and Smith, 1985) . However, the magnitude and distribution of antibody secreting cells (ASC) involved in the development of systemic and mucosal antibody-mediated immunity in the presence of passive maternal Abs, have not been evaluated in cattle. Studies conducted in mice and CD gnotobiotic pigs indicate that after rotavirus infection, anti-RV ASC are mainly located in the intestinal lamina propria and mesenteric lymph nodes, with very few ASC present in spleen and blood (Blutt et al., 2002; Hodgins et al., 1999; Yuan et al., 1996) . Additionally, studies of passive protection in gnotobiotic and conventional pigs show that high titers of passive circulating or colostrally acquired maternal antibodies confer high protection rates against rotavirus infection and disease Ward et al., 1996) . However, high titers of passive maternal Abs also significantly reduce ASC responses to RV infection, in both systemic and gut-associated lymphoid tissues of pigs . In contrast, little is known about the ASC responses against RV infection in systemic and mucosal-associated lymphoid tissues of ruminants and their modulation by the presence of maternal Abs. The ASC responses in blood of gnotobiotic lambs after RV infection have been measured; anti-RV IgA and IgG ASC are present after 7 dpi (van Pinxteren et al., 1998) . The aim of the present study was to investigate the development of the active Ab-mediated immune response against BRV in 2-day-old calves experimentally challenged with BRV, in the presence or absence of colostral Abs. The experimental design in giving calves a single oral dose of pooled control colostrum (unvaccinated cows) or immune colostrum (rotavirus vaccinated cows) shortly after birth, followed by milk without Abs, closely mimics the rotavirus vaccine and management practice currently used in dairy cattle. A better understanding of mucosal immune responses against BRV infection in calves should improve immunization strategies to control gastrointestinal diseases in cattle.",

Colostral IgG1 ingested by the neonate during the first hours of life are mainly transferred intact across the small intestinal absorptive epithelium into the calf circulation (and any compartments in equilibrium with the circulation). The amount of transferred immunoglobulin has been reported to increase from the cranial to caudal small intestine, with the ileum being the region of major absorption in calves (Jochims et al., 1994) . Passive circulating Abs, although associated with protection against RV infection, are also known to interfere with development of active immune responses in neonates (Aldridge et al., 1998; Hodgins et al., 1999; Parre\u00f1o et al., 1999) . Hence, in this study, these two properties (protection and immune interference) were evaluated. In this study Ab titers in control and immune colostrum were selected to resemble those present in colostrum from non-vaccinated and vaccinated cows, respectively, in order to evaluate their impact based on currently used parenteral inactivated maternal vaccines.",

Passively acquired Ab titers (IgG1, VN) initially detected in serum remained high throughout the experiment. In contrast, fecal anti-BRV IgG1 detected after colostrum feeding decreased sharply by 3 dpi (5 days of age), suggesting a progressive elimination of non-absorbed colostral antibodies in feces within the subsequent 4 days. It has been reported previously that calves receiving 8 l of colostrum with low titers of anti-BRV Abs within the first 48 h of life, followed by milk without Abs, have fecal IgG1 up to 6 days of age (Van Zaane et al., 1986) .",

The fecal IgG1 titers were reduced during virus shedding, but immediately increased (2-3-fold) thereafter to remain approximately constant. This observation, together with the absence of IgG1 ASC in peripheral blood (analyzed weekly) or intestinal and systemic lymphoid tissues (tested at 21 dpi) in this group of calves, strongly suggests that the IgG1 detected in feces is due to transfer of passive circulating IgG1 from the serum to the gut. This transport took place at least up to 22 days after colostrum intake. The intestinal elimination of IgG1 is proposed to be the main route of passive IgG clearance in calves; the amount of IgG1 excreted into the intestine is proportional to its serum concentration (Besser et al., 1988a,b) . The transfer of IgG from the serum to the gut has also been reported in gnotobiotic pigs injected intraperitoneally with maternal Abs and in conventional pigs fed colostrum with high anti-RV Ab titers Ward et al., 1996) . However, the transfer mechanism remains unknown for both species. The recent detection of a FcRn receptor capable of bi-directional and pH dependent IgG transport in the gut epithelium of rodents, humans and lambs suggests that a similar receptor could be involved in this process in calves (Antohe et al., 2001; Borvak et al., 1998; Dickinson et al., 1999; Israel et al., 1997; Mayer et al., 2002; Simister and Rees, 1985) .",

The onset and duration of virus shedding and diarrhea in CD calves were similar to those reported in previous studies (Fernandez et al., 1998; Saif et al., 1987) . However, in both groups of calves receiving colostrum, the onset of virus shedding was delayed until fecal IgG1 titers decreased to 1:16 or lower. As described in previous studies in which calves were fed sterilized milk supplemented with 1% immune bovine colostrum daily through 5-7 days of age (Fernandez et al., 1998; Saif et al., 1987) , the presence of local IgG1 plays a major role in protection against BRV infection and diarrhea. In the present study although calves receiving one dose of control colostrum within 6 h after birth were not protected against BRV infection, they showed a slightly delayed diarrhea of shorter duration compared to CD calves. Higher titers of passive colostral IgG1 failed to prevent BRV infection, but significantly reduced BRV diarrhea in IC calves. The protection observed in these calves might be due to neutralization of BRV by a combination of residual colostral Abs present in the intestine at the time of inoculation and IgG1 transferred into the gut from the circulation (Besser et al., 1988a; Kohara and Tsunemitsu, 2000) . However, it is important to note that clearance of virus shedding in IC calves was observed only after the development of an active IgM response in the gut.",

This observation together with the high incidence of BRV in cattle, clearly indicates that calves born to non-vaccinated dams are highly susceptible to BRV diarrhea. On the other hand, the protective effect of high colostral IgG1 titers, which significantly reduced BRV diarrhea but not virus shedding, help to explain why the current commercial vaccines are not effective in preventing BRV infection, although they significantly reduce morbidity, severity of diarrhea, and mortality in field trials (Bellinzoni et al., 1989; Cornaglia et al., 1992) .

This assay avoided inter-isotype competition that can impair the detection of isotypes present in lower titers (as is the case with IgA in the presence of high titers of passive IgG1).

The intestinal lamina propria (especially duodenum) was the main site of IgA ASC localization; both IgA and IgG1 ASC counts were high. In contrast, in Peyer's patches, MLN and spleen, the number of IgG1 ASC clearly predominated over IgA. These observations are in agreement with those in a recent study conducted in mice, where B cells activated in the gut lamina propria or in the Peyer's patches and homing to the lamina propria switched preferentially to IgA, but B cells activated in the gut lamina propria or in the Peyer's patches but homing into Peyer's patches switched to IgG with higher efficiency (Fagarasan et al., 2001) . This differential isotype switching might be related to differential microenvironments among different lymphoid tissues. Immunological studies have indicated that transforming growth factor b (TGF-b) together with IL-4, IL-5 and IL-6 (in mice and humans, but not in cattle) or TGF-b with IL-2 and IL-10 and the recently identified factor IgA-inducing protein (IGIP) (in cattle) are the factors related to IgA switching and production (Austin et al., 2003; Brandtzaeg et al., 1997; Griebel and Hein, 1996; Stavnezer, 1995) .",

The reduction of IgG1 ASC was especially noticeable in MLN, spleen and blood (all tissues in close contact with circulating Ab). In contrast, although higher numbers of IgM ASC were detected in the lamina propria of the duodenum and jejunum of CC calves, the numbers of IgG1 ASC were unaffected by low levels of passive IgG1 Ab. The observed shifts in ASC response profiles suggest that low titers of IgG1 passive Abs may impair or delay isotype switching. The strongly suppressed ASC responses observed in IC calves, clearly indicate that passive colostral IgG1 suppress B cell responses in a dose-dependent manner.",

It is postulated that T-cell independent pathway(s) are involved in production of secretory IgA antibodies (destined for the gut lumen), predominantly by B1-cells located in the lamina propria. In contrast serum IgA antibodies are considered to be products of T-dependent pathway(s) with B2cells in organized lymphoid tissues being responsible. Both serum and fecal IgA antibodies to BRV were documented in the present study, and similar results have been reported for human infants (Ward et al., 1997; Bishop et al., 1996) and gnotobiotic pigs , suggesting multiple pathways for generating IgA Ab responses to rotaviruses.",

In contrast, in calves receiving colostrum an increased number of IgM ASC were detected with a reduction (CC calves) or complete absence (IC calves) of IgA and IgG1 ASC. In calves, as in sheep, the B-cell/T-cell composition of jejunal Peyer's patches corresponds to that of a secondary lymphoid organ. This was also evident in this study for B cells where the ASC responses in the jejunal PP of all groups mirrored the corresponding ASC in spleen (Fig. 4) . In contrast, ileal Peyer's patches contain 95% B cells (Parsons et al., 1989) and are postulated to mainly function as primary lymphoid organs. In a recent study conducted in a neonatal lamb model of mucosal immunity, no ASC were detected after direct antigen inoculation into intestinal loops containing ileal Peyer's patches, suggesting their non-participation in the immune response (Mutwiri et al., 1999) . In contrast, the results of the present study show an active participation of the calf ileal Peyer's patches in the antibody response against infection with BRV. Finally, the accumulation of high numbers of IgM ASC in the ileal Peyer's patches of IC calves suggests that passive IgG1 might inhibit isotype switching from IgM to IgG1 and IgA at early stages of the mucosal immune response. Further studies are needed to better define the function of the different bovine Peyer's patches in mucosal immunity.",

The effector B-cells responsible for the antibody-mediated responses against BRV infection in calves were mainly localized in the intestinal lamina propria and Peyer's patches, followed by MLN and spleen. The bone marrow was not involved in the effector Ab responses against BRV. The intestinal lamina propria, especially of the duodenum, was the major site of anti-BRV IgA ASC localization. We further demonstrated that passive colostral Abs negatively affected the development of the mucosal and systemic Ab-mediated immune responses against BRV, in a dose-dependent manner. The presence of IgG1 in feces and intestinal contents of the calves receiving high titers of IgG1 (immune colostrum), in the absence of active IgG1 ASCs in the intestine, supports the theory of IgG1 transfer from serum to gut, as previously reported in calves.",
