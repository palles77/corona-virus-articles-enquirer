            "text": "Because of a major advantage of being a diverse group of easily manipulated viruses, bacteriophages have various potential uses both in fundamental research and in various biotechnological and biomedical applications. For example, they are used as vehicles for vaccines (both DNA and protein), for the detection of pathogenic bacterial strains, and as a display system for many proteins and antibodies. [1] [2] [3] [4] Furthermore, phages were also suggested to be used as biocontrol agents in agriculture and petroleum industry, and as alternatives to antibiotics in the case of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains. In addition, they often serve as model organisms in molecular evolution studies. [1] [2] [3] [4] Therefore, understanding the way the viral fitness is encoded in the genetic material of bacteriophages (or other type of viruses) is an important and challenging mission that may potentially contribute to all biomedical disciplines. [1] [2] [3] [4] Deciphering the regulatory information encoded in the genomes of phages or other viruses, and the relation between the nucleotides composition of the coding regions and the viral fitness is a very challenging mission, which was tackled, in the recent years, by various researchers. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] Among others, it was suggested that ribosome profiling, which enables the large in vivo genome wide monitoring of ribosome state at a resolution of single nucleotide, is a very useful tool for deciphering the coding complexity of viral (and other organisms) genomes. Specifically, it was shown that ribosome profiling enables detecting novel (possibly very short) coding regions and estimate the translation status of various open reading frames. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Here, we focus on the Bacteriophage lambda which is a wellknown and studied member of the Siphoviridae family of doublestranded DNA viruses in the Caudovirales order (also known as 'tailed bacteriophages' due to their characteristic form). During its lifecycle this phage either resides within the genome of its Escherichia coli host through lysogeny or enters into a lytic phase (which lasts $25 min) during which it produces progeny viral particles, and kills and lyses the cell (see for example 14, 15 ). The genome size of the bacteriophage lambda is $50 kb nt and includes 66 known genes that were analysed in this study. These genes can be divided into two groups, 'early' and 'late' according to the stages in the lytic phase when their expression is dominant. 9 The specific aim of this study is at exploring the way in which translation efficiency related information is encoded on a synonymous level in the coding regions of genes that are expressed during different bacteriophage lambda development stages (i.e. 0-20 min after the beginning of the lytic phase). Some previous studies shed some light on specific elements related to this topic. For example, a recent study by Liu et al. 9 employed ribosome profiling to study the progress of bacteriophage lambda gene expression during phage development and showed that the known genes are expressed in a predictable fashion; in addition many previously unknown potential open reading frames were detected. Other studies focused on different aspects of viral translation (and lifecycle in general) regulation that has a significant effect on shaping viral genomes, such as: secondary structures within viral transcripts (mainly in untranslated regions 16, 17 but also within coding regions [18] [19] [20] ) and evolutionary pressure on synonymous codons usage bias. [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study aiming to perform a comprehensive, large scale analysis of different types of genomic synonymous information related to regulation of translation efficiency in all coding regions of a bacteriophage lambda, during different stages of its development. In particular, basing on the analysis of ribosome profiling data, 9 we demonstrated, for the first time, the condition specific adaptation of the bacteriophage codons in early/late genes to the intra-cellular E. coli environment during the different stages of phage development.",

Thus, the distribution of this new random variable includes three parameters, and is called EMG distribution. 30 In this model, the typical codon decoding time was described by the normal distribution with two parameters: mean (l) and standard deviation (r); the l parameter represents the location of the mean of the theoretical Gaussian component that should be obtained if there are no phenomena such as pauses/biases/ribosomal traffic jams; r represents the width of the Gaussian component. The exponential distribution has one parameter k which represents the skewness of the NFC distribution due to reasons such as ribosomal jamming caused by codons with different decoding times, extreme pauses, incomplete halting of the ribosomes and biases in the experiment.

Since these interactions are mediated via binding of the gene expression machinery (e.g. translation/transcription factors, RNAP, ribosomes, RNA binding proteins, etc.) to the genetic material (DNA or RNA), the genetic material tend to have optimized binding sites (which are sub-sequences of nucleotides). We also expect that binding sites will appear in many coding regions and that more optimal binding sites will tend to appear more times in the genome. Thus, if longer substrings of a genome tend to appear in a certain organism's coding sequence, it suggests that this coding sequence is more optimized to the intra-cellular gene expression machinery and thus it is probably more highly expressed.

To assess the statistical significance of the signals found in the analysed viral genes and to exclude the possibility that these signals are un-direct consequences of other genomic properties, we compared them to signals expected by chance in the corresponding randomized variants (D); two different randomization models were employed: one that maintains the encoded proteins and the frequencies of pairs of adjacent nucleotides (dinucleotides), and the other that maintains the encoded proteins and the frequencies of synonymous codons (codon usage bias). Basing on the ribo-seq data, the expression levels of each gene at each time point (E), the relative decoding rate of each codon (F), and the classification of the bacteriophage genes to early and late (with respect to the beginning of the lytic phase) (G) were derived. On the basis of A, B, D, G, we performed synonymous codons usage analysis of coding regions in viral and E. coli genes (H) using the RSCF (I) and tRNA adaptation indexes (tAI) (J). On the basis of E, F, G, we analysed codons decoding rates for early/late genes at different stages of the viral development (L) on gene/genomic (M) and per-codon (N) levels. In addition, based on A, B, D, G, we studied the local and global signals of evolutionary selection for strong/weak mRNA folding (K) and for higher order synonymous information encoded in repetitive sequence motifs that are longer/more complex than single codons in the coding regions of the bacteriophage genes (O).",

The separation between the groups was measured by Davies-Bouldin index and found to be significantly higher than expected in random (P < 0.01; see methods). The separation between the groups of early and late viral genes was visualized by a maximum margin separation line-a line for which the distance between it and the nearest point from either of the groups is maximized. (B) Selection for translation elongations efficiency in bacteriophage coding regions. At each time point: average MTDR values of wildtype early/late genes (vertical bars) were compared with MTDR values of 100 corresponding randomized variants (histograms). Average wildtype MTDR values of each group are significantly higher (P < 0.05) than expected in random. The late genes were sampled to control the length factor (see methods; see also Supplementary Fig. S1 ). (C) Adaptation of translation elongation efficiency in early and late genes to different bacteriophage development stages genes. Relative translation elongation efficiency coefficient, RTEC \u00bc mean MTDR E \u00c0 mean MTDR L \u00f0 \u00de =\u00f0mean MTDR E \u00fe mean MTDR L \u00de, as a function of time from the beginning of the lytic stage (0-20 min), where MTDR E and MTDR L sigh for the MTDR of early and late genes, respectively. We can see that the RTEC of early genes is higher at the beginning and become lower with time (as expected); the first point (t \u00bc 0), when there are no measurements of expression, is ignored (see also Fig. 1B) . (D) Correlation between similar translational efficiency (Methods). Figure 2C describes the RTEC as a function of time (0-20 min). As can be seen, the relative efficiency of elongation of early genes (in comparison to the late genes) is high at the beginning and become lower with time (P-value \u00bc 0.04; based on spearman correlation). These results demonstrate that translation elongation efficiency of the early genes is relatively higher at the early stages of the bacteriophage development (when they are expressed) and the translation elongation efficiency of the late genes is relatively higher at the late stages of the bacteriophage development (when they are expressed). Figure 2D describes the per codon correlation between the TDR and RSCF for the two bacteriophage gene groups (early and late) and the E. coli genes at different time points. As can be seen, the correlation is higher and significant for the first time points in the case of the E. coli and early bacteriophage genes. For the late genes, the correlation is significant only at the initial points. The fact that the correlation between RSCF and TDR in the case of the early viral genes is significant at the initial points supports the conjecture that the relative codon decoding times change during the viral development; this is probably related, among others, to the fact that the bacteriophage affects extensively the gene expression in the cell.",

To this end, all early/late genes were aligned to the start codon and average values of a minimal folding energy (MFE) over all genes in each group were predicted within all possible 39-nt length local window. These average MFE values where compared in a position wise manner ( Fig. 3A and B) and in average over all positions ( Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S3 ) to the MFE values expected in random. Positions with significantly strong (more negative MFE) or weak (more positive MFE) folding where identified ( Fig. 3A and B) and also global P-value related to the mean average MFE values was computed (Fig. 3C) . To make sure that the obtained folding signals were not mainly an indirect consequence of codon usage bias and/or selection for specific dinucleotide contents not related to mRNA folding we employed two randomization models, one designed to maintain both the encoded protein and the distribution of dinucleotides and the other designed to maintain both the encoded protein and the codon usage bias (see the Methods section for more details).",

Interestingly, we found that in the case of the late genes there is an evidence of selection for weak folding at the 5 0 end of the coding regions, suggesting that there is a significant evolutionary pressure for improved initiation efficiency. 34 Secondly, we performed an analysis with a measure that detects long sub-sequences in the viral genome (ARS index) and were able to detect gene expression codes in an unsupervised manner 35 (see technical details in the Methods section). Our analysis (Fig. 3D ) demonstrates that both in the early and late genes there are significant gene expression codes in the bacteriophage coding regions that cannot be explained by the viral codon frequency or dinucleotide composition. These results suggest that in parallel to single codon adaptations, the bacteriophage coding regions undergoes an evolutionary pressure to include more complex/longer regulatory signals in the coding region. This suggests that additional future studies should be performed on this topic. Eight analyses were performed: two types of reference genomes; bacterial and viral, two type of randomizations; dinucleotide and codons, two groups of genes; early and late. In each histogram, the wild type distribution is compared with the mean random distribution (1,000 random genomes). The P-values were calculated according to Wilcoxon signed-rank test.",
